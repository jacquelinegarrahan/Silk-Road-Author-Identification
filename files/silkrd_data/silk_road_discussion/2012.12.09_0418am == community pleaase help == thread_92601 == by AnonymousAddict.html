You say bit instant is down (it is not now...and there are A LOT of other ways to get coin to SR) so you would like a coin from someone or from multiple people. As you would need more then 1 coin obv to get something. On top of that it is Saturday and you could not even order until Monday. Then you would have to wait until at least Tuesday (and that would cost you at LEAST 2 coins just to pay for shipping) to get your fix. You also say that you need something like &quot;H&quot;<br /><br />So my question(s) is this: Can you not see how asking for a coin does not help you? You would need lot&#039;s of coins. Also why not ask the vendor you always deal with to help you out. If you are indeed a buyer on SR then a vendor would help you out..especially if just not having the coins at that moment was the reason. Not that you don&#039;t have the money...but that you just can&#039;t use your service you are used to for getting coins on SR.<br /><br />So if you have money you could easily go and get BTC to your account..Ans in the short time that would take...your vendor could have shipped it out so you have it on Monday. Then again you also say you have been &quot;sick&quot; for a couple days...so that means you have been out of meds for that long. So one would assume that you would have tried to get meds a few days ago.<br /><br />I&#039;ll wait for your reply.

				I never said bitinstant was down or where i get coins bro, i said i fucked up and my SR money got spent by my X, I was asking for any help possible at the time, i was willing to buy a klonopin or xanax subtex something... I couldnt get in touch with my normal vendor at the time so i was freaking out since then i have... And am i a real BUYER? bro iv been a buyer on SR over 6mnths im not new to this. I got in touch with my vendor and everything is worked out.. I myself just a week ago had 10bucks left over and made a post just offering it to anybody who needed it.. Most of us older guys in the community who have been here and helped eachother berfore or have seen other do it know who are good guys and who are not, I have never ever asked for someone on heres help before simply because of the reason of a post like your being a true jerk about it.. Its kinda weird someone on here says they have coins but wont loan any to feed a drug habbit, but where r u aty? a drug buying site...what is that about?? Half of the people on here are H buyers, I just started it whn i started silkroad, iv alwasy been a opiate and xanax guy..And after i make it through this im sticking to xanax and pain meds, but i was shot in 07 in my ribs so i have true pain and i get pain meds frommmy doc but go through them and run out...So let me ask you this an then i wait on a reply, Why get on this thread and down someone cause their adked their community of suppose to be mostly good people who know the feeling an have been where i am for help? Are you new here? I never expectd to not pay it back ...Like i said iv always been the guy giving out coins to help and the one time i put it on the boards some one like u has to be a jerk..WHY? what is the reason for it, yea i have a addiction shit happens man and im trying my best to deal with it and i keep it under comtrol for the most, i just dont get anymore money til middle of this week..So thats why i cant just go by coins and add them..hope that answers your need to know question. I guess my SR member means i just come here to chat,not a real buyer..lol..ask subsandaddy ask seneca,purist,irishdan others iv got a couple dozen tranzactions at this stage and a chunk of money spent...But i will take the adice and go back to not doing H like i was..Thank god for good vendors like my main man who r willing to help.. And the one or 2 out there who do to..I dont remember seeing how long youv been here but you neeed to realize older vendors look out for one another we are a community that helps one another if needed..not a dog eat dog world thats what makes this wonderful SR diffrent than the normal street thug gang banger bullshit..hope that was enough for you

Quit crying on here. If money is not the issue then you should have NO PROBLEM getting drugs on here. That&#039;s great&nbsp; you have giving someone coin on here...You were not saying that you were short a btc or 2..You were telling all of us that you are dope sick and you were asking for a coin....on a SATURDAY evening. WTF would a coin or 2 do for you???? How would that help you? How would that help your dope sick?<br /><br />No one said anything about your drug not being ok. And you saying that older members would understand or that you wont ask unconsiderate people again...WTF are you talking about?? You need to read YOUR OP again! 1 coin or 2 would not help you at all. On top of that you say that money is not&nbsp; an issue cough***bullshit***cough. The other guy was making the point that you will be just fine..and you r not to sick if you can get on tor and write a message asking for BTC. Then you come back and get upset that no one offered you any and the reason they did was because giving you a coin would not help you. And instead of wasting your time attacking a poster with your BS...why dont you get a&nbsp; hold of your normal vendor you use and get them to send you some H over nite...That is what would help you...Not q or 2 coins!!! <br /><br />Get real!! Also realize there are a lot of dopesick people on here. and they need drugs too. And they admit unlike you that they don&#039;t have the money to get what they need. And they are smart enough not to ask for a coin because a certain service is down. Well that&#039;s what you tried telling us. This is why none of the <br />old timers&quot; offered you any help. 99% of dopeseick people cant get on the internet. And all of them are dopesick because they ran out of money to buy drugs...your not out of money according to you...yet you have been dope sick for days.<br /><br />You just started H 6 mo ago because of SR???? Then I would suggest you use this time to quit...You clearly can&#039;t handle the drug. YOU ARE ON A WEBSITE ASKING FOR MONEY BECAUSE YOU ARE DOPE SICK AND YOU NEED DRUGS...

				Every single time I have helped someone like you, meaning addicted to opiates, they only got worse. Actually they all are now dead from overdosing. So please, get yourself clean. I am not anti-drug, I am anti-death. Find a different less lethal drug if you must. Because I was once addicted, heavily. I know the game, your mind will do loops to try to get that next fix, lie, steal, cheat, whatever is cleaver. And turn you into the scum of the universe in the process. If you value your health, life and love I recommend that you walk away and never look back. I hope you get better soon bro.

				Wow Greek...nice of you..Did you read his OP? You really should before you comment on what&nbsp; us &quot;dicks&quot; are saying. <br /><br />This post is a perfect example of all that is wrong with a lot of them members of the forum. Btw thanks for the -Karma AA..shows your true colors.<br /><br />Bottom line is no one on here can help you but you. You asked for a coin or two, then asked for H. Then gave a speech how us young guns don&#039;t know shit. And all of this while claiming money is not a problem at all. it is just you can&#039;t get BTC onto SR.<br /><br />TOTAL BULLSHIT!!<br /><br />Take the advice of the few posters who KNOW what they are talking about. Use this time to QUIT H. Also take my advice..don&#039;t come on the forums and say you cant get btc right now because your way of getting them is not available at the moment *it is now and has been for over 24hrs^ and ask for a coin or 2...then say you will use it to buy H. Everyone on here knows H cost a lot more then any amount of coin you are going to get here. Especially if guys like GEEK from the other side of the pond don&#039;t read the OP and offer about 1 dollar. Also don&#039;t try and give some &quot;old timer&quot; speech when in fact if you are a guy that has been around here for a while...then you should know that you are never ever going to get what you actually need the way you asked.&nbsp; You story is total bullshit. You have no money available aka your a broke dick right now..and you have ran out of drugs and money. It is a bad combo. Whats worse is it seems you have no money or friends IRL that can help&nbsp; you or you would not be coming to the forums to beg for us to help you get drugs..like you are in some way better then the many others that need/want drugs but don&#039;t ask. Also if you had &quot;friends&quot; on here old timer you could get help. You don&#039;t. If you had a vendor and you were a good customer you could get help....YOU DON&#039;T.<br /><br />All you are is that guy that many &quot;hero&quot; members talk about that is trying to bum money. But you did it in such an odd way that even they stayed away from this post. You didn&#039;t as for the .08 BTC that the other losers ask for..you actually went for the whole Enchilada and not only asked for a measly 1 btc maybe 2...but you never offered to pay anything back...you made it clear you need H or something equivalent and ALL of us know that cost A LOT more then a btc or 2...then you went on to claim you had money and that is not a problem(total bullshit) and you also attacked someone that pointed out you have a problem , yet you stayed away from me..just giving me -Karma but knowing that everything I said was&nbsp; right on and you were smart to not try and counter what I have said. But in doing so you have managed .10 BTC.....of course &quot;if you need it&quot; JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!! Of course he needs it!! It multiplied by 100,000.00<br /><br />So stay away from this thread..let it die..and take the time being sick and not having money or drugs to hopefully cure yourself. And I said CURE not KILL!!<br /><br /><br />People please read the OP before trying to help this guy. Then you will realize it is just another lame attempt to take members money for him to get drugs!!! TOTAL BULLSHIT!<br /><br />Only good news is, at least it seems. he is not trying to scam the forums..he is just lying and begging for coin. TYPICAL.

				its funny how the majority of people bitching are newbies with few posts while people who are being sincere in their post or offer to help have been here longer.<br /><br /><br />also, aaa123321, fuck off! i have seen AA help many people out on this forum. don&#039;t criticize someone for giving money, it is my money to give how i see fit. you clearly are a person that won&#039;t give a homeless person charity if they ask because you are concerned they will use it for drugs or alcohol. if someone asks me for some change, no matter what they look like how they are dressed, i will always give w/e change i have in my pocket. it was not necessary to come in here and make any of your posts bitching at AA, instead, just read it and move on.

				AnonymousAddict, my former roommate was bad off on oxys, so I&#039;ve seen it first hand. He was doing 2-3 a day, and on days that he didn&#039;t do any, he would lay in bed all day, complaining that his back hurt and he felt like shit. That&#039;s no way to live. Drugs are supposed to be a temporary enhancement to your life, but when you&#039;re spending $150-200 a day just to feel normal, and you&#039;re completely nonfunctional without them, you&#039;ve using them wrong. The best decision he made was to quit, and yes you CAN do it.

Another perfect example of someone who can&#039;t read! And as i already pointed out you can&#039;t read...I should say you just DIDN&#039;T read anything! Because it&#039;s not funny how newbies are bitching and the&nbsp; sincere people have been here longer!! <br /><br />You come in this thread talking shit and of course making no fucking sense. Read the whole thread again and you will see EVERYONE has been sincere. And 1 person...NO YOU BY THE WAY!!! offered about $.90 cents! LOL. If you read what the OP said...he asks for a coin or 2 because he can&#039;t get btc to his Silk road account as his way (bit-instant) is/was down when he made the OP. The problem is that on Saturday when he made this post...it was up and running and taking cash deposits! Also he said he is dope sick and needs coins so he can buy H. <br /><br />Since you are so fast to point out how much AA has helped the community and such(and I in no way ever said he has not..but clearly he didnt help the right people since he has been offered 90 cents!!!)..then why don&#039;t you actually give him some real help?? I know you didnt read shit..because if you had there would be NO WAY you could come to the conclusion I wouldnt help someone that needed it. In your dumb shitty example...a homeless person...you have no clue what I would do. And all my messages in this thread have never addressed anything of the sort. What I said is how lame and wrong this post was from the start...if what he really needs is drugs to help him get over dope sick. <br /><br />Now OTHERS..not me..have said he does not need to get more drugs. What I said is that him asking for 1 coin...or even 2..(and again try reading my post and the OP before you spout off erroneous shit!)... for getting drugs to help him get over dope sick is a total fucking joke! He is lying saying money is not the issue Also unlike the other beggars on here that claim they are .08 or whatever short...this MF said he is short..THE WHOLE THING!! And he needs your generosity so he can not be dope-sick!<br /><br />I pointed out that he would need that amount just to pay for shipping something over nite. I also pointed out that he is asking on a Saturday evening. That at best he could put an order in on Monday and get it Tuesday.....AT BEST! I also pointed out that he needs a lot more then 1 or 2 coins.. And that if he were telling the truth(he is not) that instead of making a post in the forums asking for coins...and again not even offering to pay back and also saying he has money..that&#039;s not this issue(can you say total bullshit)...that he should contact a vendor and get the ball rolling that way Then if he has a regular vendor he could have that vendor put a over nite package out and when Monday gets there the OP could then&nbsp; send the coin to the vendor.. That would be the ONLY way for him to truly get med&#039;s he clearly needs!<br /><br />So now that you know what I said and you know what the OP said...you can see how fucking stupid and wrong your post is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Typical.<br /><br />I never said I would not help someone and I never ever said anyone (including you) should not give there money away!! I didn&#039;t say anything even remotely like that!

Because I know YOU are a smart guy. And a smart guy SHOULD read first. And then if they make a colossal mistake..they should apologize and explain whre the fuck they came up with their made up facts!!!!!<br /><br /><br />SO take your own advice...Read and move on..Don&#039;t bitch!

Another perfect example of someone who can&#039;t read! And as i already pointed out you can&#039;t read...I should say you just DIDN&#039;T read anything! Because it&#039;s not funny how newbies are bitching and the&nbsp; sincere people have been here longer!! <br /><br />You come in this thread talking shit and of course making no fucking sense. Read the whole thread again and you will see EVERYONE has been sincere. And 1 person...NO YOU BY THE WAY!!! offered about $.90 cents! LOL. If you read what the OP said...he asks for a coin or 2 because he can&#039;t get btc to his Silk road account as his way (bit-instant) is/was down when he made the OP. The problem is that on Saturday when he made this post...it was up and running and taking cash deposits! Also he said he is dope sick and needs coins so he can buy H. <br /><br />Since you are so fast to point out how much AA has helped the community and such(and I in no way ever said he has not..but clearly he didnt help the right people since he has been offered 90 cents!!!)..then why don&#039;t you actually give him some real help?? I know you didnt read shit..because if you had there would be NO WAY you could come to the conclusion I wouldnt help someone that needed it. In your dumb shitty example...a homeless person...you have no clue what I would do. And all my messages in this thread have never addressed anything of the sort. What I said is how lame and wrong this post was from the start...if what he really needs is drugs to help him get over dope sick. <br /><br />Now OTHERS..not me..have said he does not need to get more drugs. What I said is that him asking for 1 coin...or even 2..(and again try reading my post and the OP before you spout off erroneous shit!)... for getting drugs to help him get over dope sick is a total fucking joke! He is lying saying money is not the issue Also unlike the other beggars on here that claim they are .08 or whatever short...this MF said he is short..THE WHOLE THING!! And he needs your generosity so he can not be dope-sick!<br /><br />I pointed out that he would need that amount just to pay for shipping something over nite. I also pointed out that he is asking on a Saturday evening. That at best he could put an order in on Monday and get it Tuesday.....AT BEST! I also pointed out that he needs a lot more then 1 or 2 coins.. And that if he were telling the truth(he is not) that instead of making a post in the forums asking for coins...and again not even offering to pay back and also saying he has money..that&#039;s not this issue(can you say total bullshit)...that he should contact a vendor and get the ball rolling that way Then if he has a regular vendor he could have that vendor put a over nite package out and when Monday gets there the OP could then&nbsp; send the coin to the vendor.. That would be the ONLY way for him to truly get med&#039;s he clearly needs!<br /><br />So now that you know what I said and you know what the OP said...you can see how fucking stupid and wrong your post is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Typical.<br /><br />I never said I would not help someone and I never ever said anyone (including you) should not give there money away!! I didn&#039;t say anything even remotely like that! Yet you still made a fantasy post where you just make up shit so you can make a post....LOL. The sad thing is you won&#039;t take the time to read the thread...and you will just run away. Because I know YOU are a smart guy. And a smart guy SHOULD read first. And then if they make a colossal mistake..they should apologize and explain whre the fuck they came up with their made up facts!!!!!<br /><br /><br />SO take your own advice...Read and move on..Don&#039;t bitch! But in your case...you need to read...then make a post about what you actually read! Not some bullshit that makes NO SENSE at all. <br /><br />LOL..Balls in your court..start lying again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>so, first off, i did read what he posted in the OP. i also read what you posted the first time about how his post doesn&#039;t help him at all, and that bit instant isn&#039;t down, although he never said he used bit instant. i did not come into this thread talking shit, i cam into this thread to help out AA. and your right, everyone was being sincere, but you. so, i apologize to everyone else in this thread for generalizing and saying you weren&#039;t being sincere in your posts. now, as to the real help. he asked for some money to help him out, have have half a btc sitting in my account, left over from some LSD purchases, so i figure why not send them to him. i understand it is for H, but it is not my place to judge. if he wants to do H, it is not my place to tell him not to. that being said, you can get the substitutes to help you like subutex, which are significantly cheaper. now, as for the reason i said you would not help a homeless person, is because i assumed that you would not give them money because you feel they will misspend it on drugs or alcohol. i based this off of you saying no one should help him with money and that he should have to suffer through the sickness. all of the other posts people made were about he should work to quit, from both personal experience and seeing others in the same place, but your posts are just calling him a liar and saying no one should give him any money. also, it is sunday, not saturday. <br /><br />that being said, i have nothing against you personally, i just think it was rude to come in here and call AA a liar and say no one should give him any money. i don&#039;t see how the ball is in my court to keep lying, as i haven&#039;t been lying at all. have a nice night and a nice week :)

				TO ANOMAN---- I dont want to quote..too long.<br /><br /><br />I NEVER said no one should give him money!!! He was also referring to bit instant...but again that point is mute..You would agree that he points to something being out so he can not use his &quot;normal&quot; way to get btc...but he has money..correct? You also agree that he claims he has money and that the issue is he can&#039;t get btc...correct? <br /><br />Then you should realize this post was made on Saturday. He said he needs coins because he is dope sick... I said that he needs more then a couple coins..I also say and I stand by it...that if he has money then he really has no problem. I NEVER say he should not use the money for drugs!! I just say if he really needs drugs..then asking for 1or 2 coin in this forum is not he way to go!! I love how you come back in here with a total different attitude and you TRY and explain yourself away. First I WAS being and am sincere.. I was actually breaking it down and shoeing him how he could get REAL help...IE get drugs fast!! How do you not see that?<br /><br />You and I both know YOUR first post was total bullshit..This one is you trying to apologize and you realizing your post was total bullshit you are trying to spin it...&quot;I just came in here to help AA&quot; Really? With half a btc???? That couldn&#039;t even pay for shipping! Though I should say before you take a swipe and start spinning that it is nice of you to give something..but that something will not help OP..yes if everyone gave OP something that bam...but what YOU are missing is this great guy..never asked to borrow..HE CLEARLY says he has money and the issue is he cant get coin onto SR. Ok so lets assume he is being honest..then he really does not need your coin!! He needs a vendor to step up!!<br /><br />You keep pointing out things like &quot;I know it is for H but....&quot; Who cares if it is for H or anything else????? I think you are saying that based on some people are telling him to not get H..even he says he would take anything of the sort..but onto the OTHER people that say do not get H...the reason why is this!!! The exact position he is in!! It is the 1 drug that even people that are on it and &quot;love&quot; it tell you to stay the fuck away!! It is UNDEFEATED!!! So they are saying .get through this sickness then quit!! But I have no issues and make no judgements at all!!! I just have a HUGE issue with him asking for coin and claiming he has money..then claiming he is really sick, then him claiming he has money he just can&#039;t get coin at that moment(Saturday) and I was pointing out the easiest way for him top get drugs...because HE CLEARLY NEEDS DRUGS!!! I also point out that asking for coin in here...and not asking to borrow and not saying &quot; I am .08 away ..help me&quot; is NOT going to get him enough coin IN TIME to get drugs! How do YOU not see this is all I say.<br /><br />Again you made a jackass first post that I CLEARLY pointed out. Now I am showing you how your last post was half bullshit too!!!!!<br /><br /><br />YOU say I said this&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;no one should help him with money and that he should have to suffer through the sickness.&quot;<br /><br />I never said that!!! Once again you are just making up shit!! Also I point out how wrong your last post is..You know it..So this time you come in and you say this???? And then you end it with you have nothing personal against me??? No shit? LOL...Come one man,,,this is NEVER personal..NONE of us &quot;know &quot; each other...<br /><br />I am just pointing out that in this thread...and in this tread only..HE IS LYING!!!! I back it up with everything I have said. I say that your half a coin and the other .10 coin will not get him shit.<br /><br />I also say that this is a forum..you first said something like &quot;just read it and move on&quot; WTF is that? All of us have a right to comment. And in my comments UNLIKE YOURS..I back up everything I say with FACTS. <br /><br />You on the other hand just make up shit...STILL. You don&#039;t need to apologize for generalizing. You need to apologize for just saying complete bullshit..You using the word &quot;generalizing&quot; is just a spin job..it&#039;s like you are saying that your mistake was generalizing..where in fact your mistake was not saying 1 thing true!!! Now I really have nothing personal against YOU or the OP. I just like the truth! And if you or anyone else is going to enter a thread slinging shit..you should at least KNOW the facts and tell the truth! Correct? Even when you say &quot;everyone was being sincere but you&quot; is bullshit..I was not only being sincere..I was actually trying to point out how dishonest the OP is....and how what he was asking for in no way is going to help him. And I mean he wont get what he needs in time. Also he claims he was dope sick before Saturday. <br /><br />YOU really need to read the bullshit the OP says in the OP. Not what the people commenting are. ALL of them are &quot;right&quot; as in this is a place for people to leave their opinion. You may not like it..the OP may not like their opinion...BUT it does not matter. Where you came in here and just said total BS. You quote things that were never said. You act as if their is a certain tone with everyone and there was not. You AGAIN miss quote or even worse...you just pull from thin air things... Then you get called out..and you come back in and to a WAY lesser extent..do it again!!! I quoted you and things you claim I said. I NEVER DID!!! So again take your own advice..read the post and then move on..because now not only 1 time...but 2 times I call out your BS. Sorry that was never my intention. My intention was to call out how full of shit the OP is!!<br /><br />HE is broke and out of drugs. he is begging for money. Not offering to pay back anything. FACTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Also quit assuming..it is one of the stupidest things to do. Especially when your wrong.

What you should have said is<br /><br />&quot; I got called out and I was wrong. Your right I jumped to conclusions and made shit up. I am not used to anyone calling me out especially someone who I assumed was new. I quoted you as saying things but when I looked back and read...you never said those things. I also read the OP&#039;s OP and I realize you are correct. he asks for coins, never says he is going to borrow anything, he makes it sound as if it is very urgent yet the way he was going about it is clearly not the fastest way for him to get his fix. I see that all you were trying to do is point out how what he is saying makes no sense. I know this OP from being on here and he has always been a nice generous guy. I guess the H problem he has is affecting his judgement. It makes no sense that he claims to have money yet he can not get coin on SR. Also you are 100%v correct that if he needs a fix he should go to a vendor and explain his situation. Not ask for free coins. Also you are right it is not like he is asking for a half a coin(witch I gave him btw) he is asking for enough free coin so he can get his dope sick fixed. And I can see how you frown on that. Also I understand that if the OP has the money he says he has..then he could not have a problem! In fact it would be very simple for him to get btc. Just realize I am used to coming into a thread and saying whatever I want. No one ever calls me out for the made up things I say. And if they do I just say I do not have time to respond and tell them they win. Even though I have all the time in the world because all I do is browse through a drug forum and find threads I can comment on that really I know nothing about but I can fake it pretty well. In this case I really should have read all the OP and your post. If I had I would have not wasted all this time being wrong. Also I should have taken my own rude advice. Read and move on. But realize it is hard for me. I like to act as if I am better then most in here and I like to make post in threads about almost anything. Please realize it is not personal with you. I do this to anyone. But usually the people I do it to are to high or stupid to call me out. I have to go now. I am trying to find where I can write a feedback from a trusted forum member for free lsd&quot;

				its good to live by the principle of not spending money you dont have.... i asked for .05 btc today (hypocritically). i was short on a purchase .06 cents usd. -_-<br />. i dont know what opiate addiction is like so dont let me get a big head about this, but when you dig a hole of addiction, you have to deal with your off days am i correct? <br />besides that,most people offer to pay back with 2 btc if they are going to get one given to them. thats the only reason anyone would consider. <br /><br />your best bet is to wait, in my opinion wait till your body/mind comes back into balance and doesnt need any substance to feel fulfilled.. ive heard that the withdraw gives pains/is in general terrible, but thats such a good reason to stop what you are doing to yourself....<br />might get hate for this post, but i care about my fellow man.<br />had a kid in my town die from an opiate overdose tonight.... went to school with the kid and never couldve seen it coming...

Btw thanks for the -Karma AA..shows your true colors.<br /><br />Bottom line is no one on here can help you but you. You asked for a coin or two, then asked for H. Then gave a speech how us young guns don&#039;t know shit. And all of this while claiming money is not a problem at all. it is just you can&#039;t get BTC onto SR.<br /><br />TOTAL BULLSHIT!!<br /><br />Take the advice of the few posters who KNOW what they are talking about. Use this time to QUIT H. Also take my advice..don&#039;t come on the forums and say you cant get btc right now because your way of getting them is not available at the moment *it is now and has been for over 24hrs^ and ask for a coin or 2...then say you will use it to buy H. Everyone on here knows H cost a lot more then any amount of coin you are going to get here. Especially if guys like GEEK from the other side of the pond don&#039;t read the OP and offer about 1 dollar. Also don&#039;t try and give some &quot;old timer&quot; speech when in fact if you are a guy that has been around here for a while...then you should know that you are never ever going to get what you actually need the way you asked.&nbsp; You story is total bullshit. You have no money available aka your a broke dick right now..and you have ran out of drugs and money. It is a bad combo. Whats worse is it seems you have no money or friends IRL that can help&nbsp; you or you would not be coming to the forums to beg for us to help you get drugs..like you are in some way better then the many others that need/want drugs but don&#039;t ask. Also if you had &quot;friends&quot; on here old timer you could get help. You don&#039;t. If you had a vendor and you were a good customer you could get help....YOU DON&#039;T.<br /><br />All you are is that guy that many &quot;hero&quot; members talk about that is trying to bum money. But you did it in such an odd way that even they stayed away from this post. You didn&#039;t as for the .08 BTC that the other losers ask for..you actually went for the whole Enchilada and not only asked for a measly 1 btc maybe 2...but you never offered to pay anything back...you made it clear you need H or something equivalent and ALL of us know that cost A LOT more then a btc or 2...then you went on to claim you had money and that is not a problem(total bullshit) and you also attacked someone that pointed out you have a problem , yet you stayed away from me..just giving me -Karma but knowing that everything I said was&nbsp; right on and you were smart to not try and counter what I have said. But in doing so you have managed .10 BTC.....of course &quot;if you need it&quot; JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!! Of course he needs it!! It multiplied by 100,000.00<br /><br />So stay away from this thread..let it die..and take the time being sick and not having money or drugs to hopefully cure yourself. And I said CURE not KILL!!<br /><br /><br />People please read the OP before trying to help this guy. Then you will realize it is just another lame attempt to take members money for him to get drugs!!! TOTAL BULLSHIT!<br /><br />Only good news is, at least it seems. he is not trying to scam the forums..he is just lying and begging for coin. TYPICAL.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />BRO I NEVER SAID MY WAY OF GETTING COINS IS UNAVAILABLE BRO, I CAN ONLY GET MONEY ONCE A WEEK..THATS WHY I ASKED FOR HELP...MY REG VENDOR IS OUT MY SECOND ONE IS WORKING WITH ME,,U ARE NOT READING INTO ANYTHINT CORRRECT...I ASKED FOR ANYBODY THAT COULD HELP SOMEONE WHO IS SICK LIKE I HAVE DONE...IM not responding anymore. and igave u a -karma cause your taking this to far..Im not a bad fucking person man, im sick and just looking for help..im done, help or dont...Iv got a regular vendor, normally i do pills and H.

				You keep saying im lying and etc..Bro i dont have the cash to get the coins!!!!! it would be next weeek, i never referd to my bitcoin service is down, the money i had for SR was spent by my x by mistake, i put 100 to 300 on sr every couple weeks or sooner...I only get money everyweek , thats why i said money is not the issue, its just the time of the week..Maybe i should have went in to detail more but i feel like shit and didnt feel like it, I figured someone would help or not, AND every person that did loan me a couple bucks I DID OFFER TO PAY BACK!!! I WORK AND i have a job im not a broke bumb, Im just in a bad situation at the moment...And you seem to be the only one actually getting soo mad at this, your not offering or trying to help move on.. IM not a bad guy i have a regular vendor buit he is OUT!!!!! my other and I are working something out...Unless you just made that accoint and have been here longer your a newbie.. Iv been on here for a while and was helped..I never mislead by my post i just didnt feel like detailing every fucking point cause i didnt think some jerk like u were gonna act like u have.. If some one else was in need I WOULD DAMN SURE DO IT IF THEY OFFERD TO PAY BACK OR NOT AND I HAVE... WHAT HAVE U DONE TO HELP ANYONE HERE? Consider this post dead iv worked it out with my other vendor thnk god for him, and also A WELL KNOWN VENDOR SO GOES TO SHOW HOW BROKE I AM. ever herd of subsandaddy??? Really good guy.. Why are u worried about if other wanna help..? Cause U feel i lied? Well your wrong and im sorry u feel that way...Im gonna leave it aat this your fully right im just a bum as you say and all that other stuff u had to say, right on man..you are a big great part to our community that gets to know and help when in need...O and im broke and have no friends n real life? IM not gonna ask my friends who dont know im struggling with a addiction to give me drug money...your on here buyer drugs just a diffrent kind, so your better than me right? This the first time iv ever asked someone to help me, and the last, but i will always help others when they need a coin or 2 or if i have it 3 or 4.. Have a good day ..Sorry you feel the way u do u dont know me,,,and judging me by one post of a few lines is the wrong way...Have fun buying your drugs... AND TO ALL YOU THAT HELPED ME,THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART...

				&nbsp;There is arguing for the sake of better understanding, and then arguing for the sake of arguing. We should be attempting to help each other as a community. People will always hold there opinions with an iron fist, especially on forums, so instead of seeing who&#039;s wall of texts are stronger, I&#039;d advise to just move on. This thread became very unattractive to read and helpful posters may have just clicked away from here.

				AnonymousAddict, you seem like a good guy and I enjoy your posts in the heroin threads...my advice would be to stock up on lots of Suboxone or cheap opiate pills so that you&#039;ll have some backup for when you run out of heroin.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using heroin for over 10 years and I can tell you that you&#039;re going to be sick a lot more often...it&#039;s just the name of the game.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some helpful tips for when you&#039;re dopesick:<br /><br />1. Kratom - It will take away most of the withdrawals (although you&#039;ll still be feeling kinda crappy because it&#039;s weak on it&#039;s opioid agonistic activity.<br />2. Loperamide - You typically know this as &quot;Immodium&quot; but you can purchase generic Loperamide pills for really cheap at Walmart, Target, CVS, etc. You&#039;ll have to take it in high doses (and you should only use it for a few days because it can dehydrate the hell out of you and high doses of it probably aren&#039;t good for your body) but it&#039;s an opioid-receptor agonist and will make you feel a lot better when you&#039;re dope sick.<br />3. DXM - DXM can help you out when you&#039;re sick if you take a moderate dose (don&#039;t do to much, just enough to numb your body). I find that DXM helps with almost all of the symptoms (especially RLS).<br />4. Tramadol - Tramadol is really cheap and there&#039;s an online store called &quot;Click Remedy&quot; that sells 100 50mg Tramadol pills for only $35 or something like that. I find that Tramadol really helps with RLS and also can improve your mood and a few other symptoms...just try not to take it for to long.<br /><br />Anyways I hope some of those tips will help you out and better prepare you for the next time you&#039;re dopesick!

				Be careful with Kratom. It can be hepatotoxic. I don&#039;t consider it entirely safe. Best of luck to all of you. I have been through w/d myself and it sucks. All that helped me was DXM and loperamide. If you can get Tramadol that will help too. Easier to get from some docs.

Dextromethorphan... I didn&#039;t trust my memory for how it is spelled and looked it up, but apparently I did remember correctly.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in the USA, chugging a bottle of Delsym will make you vomit some time later then get you high, quite likely for several days. I&#039;m not sure who suggested it or why, but that&#039;s what I know about it.

				Definitely keep subutex around if you can get it.&nbsp; I have found it harder and harder to get.&nbsp; Although a few guys on here have the suboxone strips so that is also just as good.&nbsp; One of those will keep you good all day...&nbsp;
