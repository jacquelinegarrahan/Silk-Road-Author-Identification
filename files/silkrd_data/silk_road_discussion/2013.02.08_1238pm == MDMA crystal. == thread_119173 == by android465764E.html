				I find it so frustrating that we can&#039;t sort by price on SR.<br />I&#039;m hoping someone else has already found out, which vendor sells the cheapest white mdma crystal? <br />Int or domestic (uk), not bothered which.

				I usually have white crystals - not in stock at the moment.<br /><br />So, I&#039;ll recommend Pyramid - his reviews are good, he is UK based, white crystal. <br /><br />So, yeah. Check him out.

				Honestly sorting the MDMA listings in any manner doesn&#039;t seem to help. Even if it did sort by price many of the cheapest members have a horrible track method of lost or seized packages. Your best bet by far is to read the threads in the rumor mill and come to a conclusion there.<br /><br />

MDMA vendors seem to be the biggest scammers on the SR, so when you find a good one with a good product it is wise to stay with them.<br /><br />When I first joined I almost placed a large order with one of the &quot;bestseller&quot; MDMA members on the 1&#039;st page. I am glad I did not do that because after research I found lots of orders were missing and many time 50% refunds or no refunds were given. It is a shame, but that&#039;s what happens. MDMA vendors also seem to require FE way too much, <br /><br />Then you also have to watch out for the vendors who bait &amp; switch... or bait &amp; take your money (Foxbelle77, case in point)<br /><br />Sorry, I went on a bit of a rant there. haha

				Oh dude, the search on SR definitely needs to be refined.... I also want to have the option to search stuff from cheapest bitcoins to most expensive.<br /><br />Also i dont see the point of the domestic option... I thought domestic was to search for products from vendors within your own country basically.&nbsp; When i check and uncheck domestic, there is no difference in my searches.<br /><br />There should also be an option to search for venders who sell to your area.&nbsp; Trying to find molly was such a long process for me because vendors have written they sell worldwide, but when u read their description there are so many limits to the USA and then most dont even have a refund policy for the US but they advertise 100% refund everywhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />The search def needs some improvements, but hey this is better than no SR at all.
