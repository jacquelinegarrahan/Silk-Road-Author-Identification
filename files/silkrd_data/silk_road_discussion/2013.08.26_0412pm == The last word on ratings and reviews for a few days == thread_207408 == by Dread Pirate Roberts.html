				Not sure where to begin here...<br /><br />First off, if you haven&#039;t read the Ratings &amp; Reviews wiki page, do so now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to see people commenting in this thread if you haven&#039;t read that.&nbsp; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Ratings_%26_Reviews)<br /><br />There were a few changes over the last 24 hours and if you just read through the commentary on the forum, you&#039;ll probably be confused.&nbsp; Here is where we stand at the moment:<br /><br />All past ratings and reviews have been imported into the new layout.&nbsp; However, reviews from before the update do not display the user&#039;s alias or their buyer stats, so no new information is being displayed that wasn&#039;t before.&nbsp; Reviews that are left from now on will have buyer stats displayed next to them.<br /><br />Also, for a short time, viewing your past feedback was removed.&nbsp; It is now back with extra info under a &quot;recent orders&quot; link on your account page.&nbsp; Reviews have been removed from item pages temporarily and will be returned in the new format.<br /><br />I&#039;ll address some common complaints:<br /><br />The new format reveals too much info.<br />The old format revealed too little, allowing fake reviews to go unnoticed.&nbsp; We&#039;ve given you the option to review and discuss under an alias and we&#039;ll look into further obscuring the information revealed in reviews/discussions, but for now if you don&#039;t want that info shown, just don&#039;t leave a review.<br /><br />I liked how I could see every rating and every review for a vendor.<br />So did LE.&nbsp; This has been a problem since the beginning, allowing LE to know EXACT sales volume and quantity on every vendor on SR.&nbsp; Correcting this was the primary motivation for overhauling the review system.<br /><br />The new layout is too complicated.<br />We&#039;ve added new information, yes, but it is up to you whether you want to pay attention to it.&nbsp; All vendors are still given a single average rating if that&#039;s all you want to look at.&nbsp; You can still sort by freshness and look at the most recent 10 reviews.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like seeing the rating broken down by 1 - 5 or you don&#039;t like the new review page, or you don&#039;t like seeing the transaction and buyer stats, then ignore that stuff and just look at what you&#039;ve always had access to.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like it, let&#039;s just go back to the old way.<br />No.&nbsp; Not until we&#039;ve given this a chance.&nbsp; No one likes change, but there were serious problems with the old way of doing things even if you never noticed them, and we have to try to find a better way.&nbsp; I&#039;m not willing to settle for a system that is easily gamed by scammers and gives LE complete sales data on every vendor on the site.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like how ratings/reviews are permanent.<br />I&#039;m still open to discussing a better way, but the more I think about it the more it seems like it is only an issue if you are asking customers to finalize early.&nbsp; If they have a problem, they take it to the resolution center where you work all of that out.&nbsp; The only problem I see with permanent ratings is with vendors not using the system as it was designed and asking customers to do things that put their money at risk.&nbsp; Am I missing something?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d like to acknowledge that this hasn&#039;t gone as smoothly as it could have.&nbsp; I am sorry for this and will do my best to learn from this experience and do better in the future.&nbsp; I just ask that everyone be patient, try not to get so emotional and remember to have fun.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing my best to hear everyone&#039;s concerns and design things to accommodate them.&nbsp; If you are going to criticize, please do so constructively by offering a solution.&nbsp; This is a process.&nbsp; We are in the middle of it, and I promise that where we end up will be better than where we started and certainly not worse.<br /><br />This is the last I am going to say on the matter for a few days, and unless there are any major problems that I hadn&#039;t noticed before, there won&#039;t be any new changes until then.

				I love the new system, the more information buyers have the better, but at the same time it&#039;s good that our total sales volume is now obscured from LE, making it harder for them to deduce the scope of our dealings in any possible legal action.<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait for the new updates where you will add more options to protect against scamming buyers. Please allow vendors to rate buyers, this would cut down on so much scamming and also give a chance for really good buyers to be rewarded with a reputation that would make their future transactions with other vendors easier. Not only that, it would give the staff in resolution center more information to work with as they could more carefully review a buyers history as a customer!<br /><br />Keep up the good work DPR, we really appreciate what you are doing :)

				&nbsp;No you&#039;re not missing nothing, these vendors shouldn&#039;t be asking people to do things with their money that are dodgy. The only people who have a problem with this is vendors who want buyers to&nbsp; F/E, so you&#039;re either a scammer or out of order. as you shouldn&#039;t be asking for F/E. Nobody else sees a problem, if you&#039;re playing with straight dice, then you don&#039;t have to worry. Love it DPR.

				One thing I&#039;ve noticed is that vendors who made private/stealth listings for their clients are having those reviews show up for everyone to see. So for example, on a certain vendor&#039;s page I can see &quot;private 4 [name]&quot; and the dollar amount that they spent on it. I was under the impression that these types of reviews didn&#039;t typically show on the vendor&#039;s page for everyone to see but still went towards their total feedback. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong?<br /><br />Also, if you need the specific vendor&#039;s name you&#039;ll have to PM me.

				For anything to run efficiently over the long haul there has to be constant change, life is all about adapting. I am fairly new to this site still, but I have to say the changes look pretty clean to me so far. There are always bugs at the beginning of any overhaul, but in time I think they will get worked out and SR will be all the better for it.

It looks like every sale ever made in the past 4-5 months is currently showing along with the dollar amounts, whether the listing was private/stealth or not. I might be wrong about this but at first glance that is what I am seeing. Some vendors go back as far as 5 months 15 days and others I can only see as far back as 4 months 18 days. <br /><br />But not every sale ever is showing, unless perhaps you haven&#039;t been around very long and your history only goes back 4-5 months.

On Sunday updates rolled out that showed the exact listing name and link to it as well as how long ago the customer finalized. Not only were these two things shown to everyone who ever could want to look at it, but, it also showed the exact dollar amount. <br /><br />This allowed LE to determine exactly how much a vendor has made, they can now link any intercepted packages to bitcoin transactions as well as link the buyer and the seller to it. Not once were these updates mentioned to us vendors. Nor was any vendor aware that this information went public if they did not log in on sunday. It is vendors like me that are letting everyone know what actually happened. I love this place, but, someone has the responsibility over my security as well as my buyers. That person screwed up OUR security. Please do not make a major change like this, even if you change it back without at least notifying every vendor and buyer what actually happened and not just pretend like it didn&#039;t happen at all.<br /><br />Sorry DPR, this was not right. And there is no repercussions for you. Only us.<br /><br />

				That is fine, but, they also included the exact dollar amount for the order as well. LE basically knows now how much any vendor has sold according to their feedback till whenever the cut off is. Not including the fact that it made it that much easier to connect the dots on the block chain and link vendor and buyer. Wallet addresses and what not. It is just too much info that was basically covered up like nothing ever happened.

				Yep! I sure hope its not final.....Not being able to change a feedback is not a good idea. Mistakes do happen all the time. Buyers and vendors deserve a second chance as far as feedback is concerned :)

Please allow vendors to rate buyers, this would cut down on so much scamming and also give a chance for really good buyers to be rewarded with a reputation that would make their future transactions with other vendors easier.

				And finally while I&#039;ve mentioned this is a few other threads I&#039;ll just say it once more and hope the change is implemented.&nbsp; IMO the update is great except for one change and that is to encourage people to write up feedbacks and reviews of vendors.&nbsp; Is there a way to make the &quot;review&quot; button on the vendor page really big so people don&#039;t miss it?&nbsp; Better yet can we move the review back to the same page where you leave the 1-5 rating?&nbsp; I&#039;m not scratching my head as to why this got moved.&nbsp; I know why this got moved and it&#039;s because it protects the vendors in that everyone now will probably not leave a review or feedback and therefore LE can&#039;t go back and hover over every item and see how much business a vendor is doing.&nbsp; As DPR said this was his main objective, but IMO it comes at a cost to buyers.&nbsp; And that cost is overall safety and security.&nbsp; A buyer now has less information, not more, to go off of.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s accurate to say that the information that is there now is the same information that was there before.&nbsp; The &quot;discuss&quot; button has hardly been used in the past week and in the future we&#039;ll see less reviews and write ups because now the &quot;review&quot; button is in the exact same spot.&nbsp; Please move it back or resize it or something and start encouraging reviews to be written.&nbsp;

				I see a lot of good changes, and I haven&#039;t had time to fully evaluate the whole system yet so I will refrain from a long post on this one. I think DPRs going in the right direction, and I certainly look forward to the vendor-related changes.<br /><br /><br />However, my first initial problem came today when I put myself into the mindset of a new buyer.<br /><br />If I stumbled across one of Cork1Screw&#039;s listings in the Prerolled category, the picture and description may interest me. However I scroll to the bottom of the page and no reviews are displayed. Okay, so then I click through to the vendor&#039;s profile. I read some more, and it seems like everything is in order. Then I get to the reviews...now I start reading. By default, the reviews I&#039;m seeing are all higher quantity weed reviews (due to the nature of this weighting system)...no mention of any measly low-dollar Prerolled joints anywhere. As a buyer, I&#039;m a bit confused at this point. I just want to know if this guy rolls joints as well as he claims he does. <br /><br />So at this point, as a buyer unless I then go to the additional step of assuming that this guy even has any reviews for his joints,&nbsp; I then need to &quot;Click here for more&quot; and then change the sort option to freshness, and then scroll down and look through all Cork1Screw&#039;s recent reviews manually until I find the ones for his last chronologically added listings (Prerolled joints) and see that people do indeed like the joints. Seems like a very convoluted and confusing process just to see if I roll joints well.<br /><br />If my story was a bit confusing, I will reiterate: as a vendor of multiple products, my &quot;high dollar value&quot; products are going to dominate my feedback and make feedback for my other products very hard, if not near impossible, to locate. <br /><br />I do not know what the best solution to this is, but I know it needs something. My suggestion would be to look into some way of displaying a feedback average, reviews, bar graph, or some combination thereof on each individual listing. Security concerns in mind of course. I&#039;m not against the idea of giving vendors the complete control to display or not display individually on the listings at their discretion.

By default, the reviews I&#039;m seeing are all higher quantity weed reviews (due to the nature of this weighting system)...no mention of any measly low-dollar Prerolled joints anywhere. As a buyer, I&#039;m a bit confused at this point. I just want to know if this guy rolls joints as well as he claims he does. <br /><br />So at this point, as a buyer unless I then go to the additional step of assuming that this guy even has any reviews for his joints,&nbsp; I then need to &quot;Click here for more&quot; and then change the sort option to freshness, and then scroll down and look through all Cork1Screw&#039;s recent reviews manually until I find the ones for his last chronologically added listings (Prerolled joints) and see that people do indeed like the joints. Seems like a very convoluted and confusing process just to see if I roll joints well.<br /><br />If my story was a bit confusing, I will reiterate: as a vendor of multiple products, my &quot;high dollar value&quot; products are going to dominate my feedback and make feedback for my other products very hard, if not near impossible, to locate. <br /><br />I do not know what the best solution to this is, but I know it needs something. My suggestion would be to look into some way of displaying a feedback average, reviews, bar graph, or some combination thereof on each individual listing. Security concerns in mind of course. I&#039;m not against the idea of giving vendors the complete control to display or not display individually on the listings at their discretion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is also something I think that needs to be addressed,

				The only change I take issue with is to inability to edit previous feedback. I can see how this would discourage vendors from asking buyers to FE, and I think a good compromise point is to allow the text to be edited, but only allow the numerical rating to increase. This keeps the discouragement against FE, as a buyer would now be more likely to just leave a 1/5 until the package is received, since they can&#039;t go back the other way in the event of an issue with the transaction.<br /><br />The best change, in my opinion, is disallowing vendors from seeing who left what feedback if the buyer used an alias. This means a buyer can be honest without fear of reprisal by a jilted vendor that still has the buyers address. This, however, presents the issue that a vendor can no longer message that buyer to try and smooth things. The solution to that seems to be to give the vendor a link to send a message to the alias, without revealing who the buyer&#039;s main username actually was.

				I personally LOVE the new rating system....It is amazing. Buyers can now see how many 1/5&#039;s you have gotten in 2 seconds instead of just scrolling through pages of feedback. The new system is great for buyers with the weighed and freshness option as well and there really is not that much more info being displayed to LE. I really do not mind them at all and think they are great...

Now, I have to go to a link and then resort and go to at least 4 more pages after that to see the most recent feedback.<br />I think making fresh feedback the default on the vendor page is appropriate.<br />I also want the sort button on the vendor page (even if it takes you to another page).<br />Breaking feedback into 5 sub-categories makes it very time-consuming to use. Many new users may fail to realize there is any negative recent feedback with this sort not necessarily showing the most fresh feedback. I think the Sub-categories need to be a sort option you can choose, not the default.

They also can realize a miscommunication after an initial reaction to a perceived situation they later realize was not factual. That is just a couple of examples that pop to mind. Also, a less than 5/5 rating often generates vendor action that allows the buyer to be made happy enough to change it to 5/5. I agree that it should not be like that. Buyers deserve 5/5 service without needing to use the feedback system to get action from a vendor. I do think taking away the ability to raise a feedback rating will be more harmful than the quote above suggests you expect. I don&#039;t know if letting it be changed upward by buyers, but not downward is an option? That might solve all my initial concerns. Another option is to have SR staff (or an automated system) available to alter the feedback when the buyer and seller agree to a change.<br />Since you brought up FE in such a negative light, I will also say I think requiring FE of new accounts by established vendors on larger purchases is appropriate. I hate to bring up another potential big project, but, SR&#039;s unwillingness to let finalized transactions go to some sort of resolution process seems like a mistake to me. I know adding this would be a huge deal, but I think the SR of the future should have it.

				DPR - change can be good and appreciate moving forward. Remember what made this site success, simple easy and safe.<br /><br />With all code changes more db lookup more processing etc keep in mind proper code audit. these change can cause unintend security problem.<br /><br />Few comment:<br /><br />Permanent feedback. think not best idea. many reason to change feedback not relate to scam. also slow down current vendor state of affair. if feedback only made 1 time can take more then 20 day before a feedback leave for problem as would go through resolution 1st, then maybe re-ship promise, maybe extend resolution many time etc. <br /><br />Can see how vendor can keep negative feedback or scam for 30+ day before anybody get warning. Current way can leave feedback to warn about problem immediate and change update as go on. also see that many people F/E is best way to get warning of scam vendor, you take away this important tool by not edit feedback.<br /><br />some vocal vendor cry a lot about scam buyer in forum. we know many vendor and scam buyer is real but selective scam vendor or bad service vendor is worse risk we think. if vendor make 300 sale in 1 month and 4 $80 sale are scam buyer, sometime this price of doing business and you refund the 4 scam buyer and save rating and end problem. This real problem in real life also, always have some small percentage of stolen credit card, shop lift etc. cost of business. vendor take care of customer like this show good customer service skill and is positive behavior from vendor. ways to mitigate larger scale scam. via tracking and store policies etc. cannot take away all risk all time and try to do this will cause more problem then solution.<br /><br />now you say that buyer should use new discuss option to say these thing or forum, etc. see problem? adding complexity and steps to former simple process. you have feedback, discuss and forum. take time a learning curve. not for &quot;us&quot; but many not bother. believe end result is less safety for buyers and slower evolution of current vendor state.<br /><br />new format also take more screen space and much empty space on page. max information in smallest space, more compact. depend on how person access, maybe take longer time for screen updates to scroll long page and have to load more often. <br /><br />if can make sure new code is safe, compact feedback view, make stats more fuzzy and leave feedback able to edit think new changes will be winner&nbsp; :)

I am fine with that idea in theory. I don&#039;t think the anonymous posting part is going to work though. The forum reputation of those who comment is too important to abandon unless something as functional can be developed on SR&#039;s discussion pages. I guess it is possible. As Pine would probably tell us, we should not use our SR identities (Buyer/Vendor) when developing a reputation on the forum or in the discussion area. So, this could be a fresh start and we could all begin new reputations on SR in discussions and feedback. It would be nice to move full reviews to SR if they persist. That reminds me, SR seems to delete everything that is a couple months old. If that is true of the new discussion areas, then, almost no one will waste time developing a reputation that way. So, I guess unless SR really wants to develop persistant reputations on SR, the discussion area is unlikely to be nearly as functional as the forum. I&#039;m not sure I understand the plan/intent though.

And for such buyers, DPR&#039;s recommendation is not to leave a review.<br /><br />As a buyer myself, I don&#039;t particularly want my stats published either (except to the vendors I buy from), but I do see that reviews are much more useful with buyer stats included, for multiple reasons. So what to do?<br /><br />I think the best solution is the one suggested by someone in another thread (sorry i&#039;ve forgotten who or exactly where), in which a buyer can choose the stats to be displayed with their review(s), within limits defined by the buyer&#039;s actual stats.<br /><br />For example, say I have the following buyer stats:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">account age&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11m 6d<br />total transactions&nbsp; &nbsp;25<br />total spent&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $2,345<br />total vendors&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7<br />refund rate&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.2%<br />auto-finalize rate&nbsp; &nbsp;4%<br /></code><br />... then for a particular review I might choose the following stats to be displayed with the review:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">account age&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9+ months<br />total transactions&nbsp; &nbsp;15+<br />total spent&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $900+<br />total vendors&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5+<br />refund rate&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; 10%<br />auto-finalize rate&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; 5%<br /></code><br />... just as long as the chosen stats do not paint a prettier picture than my actual buyer stats.<br /><br />This facility might encourage more buyers to leave reviews because the information exposed, while still of value when compared to the old system, is less precise and thus the review is more anonymous, especially if the buyer can choose a different alias for each review. <br /><br />And I think it is far better than this option:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=207090.msg1493745#msg1493745">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on August 27, 2013, 12:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">new reviews show a buyer&#039;s stats [...].&nbsp; I think what we are going to do is give users the option to turn this off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But the bottom line for me is that, with the new system as it stands, I will not be leaving any reviews, but I definitely want my vendor to know what rating I have given the transaction. Can my vendor see that information if I don&#039;t leave a review?<br />

I&#039;d guess there is a flaw in the math (which I have not been able to understand anyway) or the hidden info about one or more of the buyers that gave you low ratings makes them extreme heavyweights and they are unbalancing your ranking. On first glance this does not seem correct. I can&#039;t see all the important info, though. I wonder if this is happening to others also?

I can see how this would discourage vendors from asking buyers to FE, and I think a good compromise point is to allow the text to be edited, but only allow the numerical rating to increase. This keeps the discouragement against FE, as a buyer would now be more likely to just leave a 1/5 until the package is received, since they can&#039;t go back the other way in the event of an issue with the transaction.<br /><br />The best change, in my opinion, is disallowing vendors from seeing who left what feedback if the buyer used an alias. This means a buyer can be honest without fear of reprisal by a jilted vendor that still has the buyers address. This, however, presents the issue that a vendor can no longer message that buyer to try and smooth things. The solution to that seems to be to give the vendor a link to send a message to the alias, without revealing who the buyer&#039;s main username actually was.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s not strictly true, Via the &quot;view feedback&quot; link I can still see all&nbsp; numerical feedback for my items sold and the real account name of the person who left it so using an alias only protects the person from other buyers/vendors/LE and basically serves no purpose at all other than leaving an anonymous review on the discussion page (which anyone can do)

				I&#039;m not liking the fact that when I click on an item now there is no feedback on the bottom of the page for that specific item. And when I go to the vendor page I have to sift through all the reviews to try to find the ones for that item. That makes me a sad ice cream man :(

It can be padded rather easily as well if anonymous posting by non-buyers is being allowed. Seeing the commenter&#039;s stats should help a lot with that. I don&#039;t think anyone is asking that that page be removed. I think the complaints are about the feedback system and how it is displayed (and not displayed). I think a weighted feedback sort is valuable for identifying selective scammers if it can be weighted properly. I doubt anyone is opposed to having that sort available. My main issue at this time is lack of easy access to recent transactions so buyers and vendors can see what has been happening most recently. I think this information is crucial to buyers and darn handy for vendors.<br /><br />A side note:<br />If feedback with prices buyers spent is still being reported, I&#039;d like those prices to be accurate (or generalized and clearly labeled as such). Last time I saw them they appeared to be reporting a lowered amount. I&#039;m guessing it was the amount the seller received after SR fees. I think the full amount the buyer paid should be reported.
