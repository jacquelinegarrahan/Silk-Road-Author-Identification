				this is not silk road related, i just got a&nbsp; pill container the kind that has 7 differnt spots to put pills, in, the kind old peopel use, its labled sunday thogh sat. I was wondering if i got pulled over and cops found it with weed in all 7 slots, would i be cahrged for possesion witth intent to distribute, or just possetion, does that count as just one big container. I know for example if they found 2&nbsp; baggies they can charge you wiht intnet to distribute, as apposed to one bag, wich woudl just e possession.&nbsp; Can some one with knoledge in this field help me out here. I want to quit taking my scale with me , <br /><br />woudli be more lieky&nbsp; charged iwht intent to disstribute with a scale and one jar, or the pill container

				Legally it is considered 1 container. But they can charge you with trafficking regardless. They do what they want.

				First of all, those pill containers your talking about I have seen them, they are pretty small slots to begin with, are you trying to go around selling enough for a joint to different people? I mean, what is that...<br /><br /><br />Judging by the way you used the term &#039;trafficking&#039; your US based and my friend you are a long distance away from traffic, regardless of what state your in.<br /><br /><br />Traffic of maijuana if I am not maistaken it only starts in the pounds, anything less or more then a joint you will most likely get possession with intent, don&#039;t think this is a joke. And I would &#039;traffic&#039; that scale around back and forth if I was you. <br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				i only sell to about 2 people a day right now, each of the slots fits 1 gram, so i can haul around 7 grams, people only by 8ths from me at the most.&nbsp; i dont need to have alot with me at once. i just would liek to know if i can get in bigger trouble then just a ticket (possession) using that container, wich is technically one container, but it has 7 slots. <br /><br />i just had to edit this because i realized i was askign about posseion with intent. not trafficking would

				Technically it is one container, yes, but Technically, it&#039;s seperated into individual deal, so possession with intent to supply :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Now how technical the situation will get will depend much on the dick whose about to put the cuffs on you. The part you said about the tank, I thought I came up with invention :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				posseion with intent to distribute is what i am tryign to&nbsp; avoid,&nbsp; if they charge me with posseion i dont really worry about.&nbsp; you are thinking of the correct type of pill boxes i am talkign about, but the one i have is bigger then what they used to make. any way what if i cut half of each wall that seperated&nbsp; each slot, so would that be considered one conatienr then with no&nbsp; &quot;slots&quot;<br /><br /><br />wouldi be more likely charged with possesion and intent wiht a scale and one jar, or th epill container and no scale?

				Pill jar is much better than scales. Courts are used to scales being proof-positive as they see so many of them.<br /><br />The pill container you can claim it&#039;s just for convenience: keep track of how much you&#039;re smoking in a handy container to have. Do the pill boxes have individual lids? Again, you can say that&#039;s because you once had an open container, it spilt outside, and you lost almost all your weed on the ground, so you wanted to avoid that.<br /><br />You might want to consider make one of the capsules half-full to &quot;prove&quot; you&#039;re using it for personal. If every container is full of exactly the same amount that might be seen as a different story... but if you can &quot;show&quot; you&#039;re smoking it. Also, you might want to consider keeping some personal fixing stuff with it - rolling papers, lighter, etc., - again to show it&#039;s for your actual use.<br />
