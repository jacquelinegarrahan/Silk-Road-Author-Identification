				Hello,<br /><br />Seller here. Just curious as to what the protocol is for buyers when they release funds from escrow. There are a few orders that I know should have arrived by now but the funds are still dangling out of my reach until the buyers release them. <br />So buyers, do you typically sample the product before leaving feedback and releasing funds or do you trust the legitimacy of the product once you physically have it in your hands? <br /><br />Thanks for any replies :)

				Hi,<br /><br />Buyer here.&nbsp; Where possible, I finalize and leave feedback <br />the afternoon or evening of receipt.&nbsp; I appreciate the<br />hell out of the whole SR/BTC/Seller setup and hope <br />to establish a positive rep as (infrequent small time) <br />buyer with a few good sellers.<br /><br />It is odd there is no feedback system on buyer&#039;s,<br />even objective stats like number of disputes and<br />average period between transit and finalize.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only thing that would improve things for me at this <br />point would be if there were some way to eliminate the<br />wild BTC valuation swings.&nbsp; That should be reserved for<br />a different market, maybe day trading or gambling sites.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure if it continues that something will be done to <br />reduce the BTC risk for both sellers and buyers,<br />conversion of escrow/wallet to put options or currencies <br />and only use BTC for payment moving/transfers...<br />

				A comment on this was made by a seller a few weeks ago in that he was happy that the buyers received the items but they were giving feedback before testing the product.&nbsp; Although he was confident of his product, his bugbear was that if the item was fake or not up to scratch, the buyers would have no way of getting refunds.<br /><br />The problem with waiting till the product is sampled is that this may not happen for days after it is received, which is unfair to the seller.&nbsp; I think buyers should finalize a transaction 24 hours after receipt of goods and by sampling, it doesn&#039;t have to be a full on bongfest or mirror party, just a quick look/smell/taste.

				If its herbal and I can tell from sight/smell that its legit, I&#039;ll finalize right away. if its a pill or powder, I usually do a sample within 24 hours. i never wait more than 48hours - it just isn&#039;t fair to the seller. if i&#039;ve already bought from the seller, I&#039;m much more likely to finalize without sampling.

				It&#039;s an ethical thing: I figure I owe it to the seller to get home, check out product if I must, but quickly get online and finalize transaction.&nbsp; Hour at most.&nbsp; Usually I pm them too, especially if there&#039;s been any problems...let them know all is well...

				@phubaiblues: I agree with you completely. I can&#039;t re-order until people clear escrow, so it delays it for everyone when (like today) someone says &quot;I got it, great shipping, I&#039;ll release escrow when I try it this or next weekend&quot;. Next weekend, really? What am I supposed to do till then? Especially when other reviewers and myself have tried it...

				I hear that man. But I&#039;m sure next week it&#039;ll be back up, the consistency of the BTC value is ridiculous haha. Zapod is right though, I need those funds for other things: ordering new products, keeping current products in stock, and purchasing goodies for myself!

				I know this will sound silly, but I actually think a lot of buyers don&#039;t realize the connection between us clicking &#039;finalize&#039; and sellers getting their btc.&nbsp; Maybe a pm to the slowpokes or something...

				Yep: we make a lot of noise in threads and all when pkg *doesn&#039;t* arrive, so the fair thing is to make noise and&nbsp; post in thread and release funds when it *does* arrive.&nbsp; I usually send pm, too.&nbsp; Buyers forget that sellers are waiting too.&nbsp;

				right on phubaiblues, thanks for being on it. As a seller it is totally frustrating.<br /><br />GreenCo always ships out same or next day so if the funds are not released withing 7 days of the order they send out a reminder note to the buyer. Sometimes a buyer logs in to make a purchase and then just disappears. This is really frustrating. GreenCo has had lots of orders where the buyer NEVER released the funds. They do time out and auto-resolve after 30 days but GreenCo&nbsp; would like to get that lowered to 7 or 10 days. All orders from GreenCo arrive within a week (typically 3-4 days).<br /><br />GreenCo&#039;s customer service does not stop just because a buyer releases funds.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have time to try it and release their funds they will still honor their 100% satisfaction guarantee. They do non-escrow sales also. Feedback is awesome, but reputation is priceless.

				I was just wondering about this too. I messaged the buyer to ask if he&#039;s recieved anything, but havent heard Any reply from him (it&#039;s been a few days now). So I don&#039;t know what to do about it, and it&#039;s 100$

				@zapod It will auto resolve in 30 days and 6 hours. Yes it sucks but it is not that uncommon.

				You can see which PMs have been read and which haven&#039;t (the ones that haven&#039;t are bold) just go to your sent messages and check it out. Chances are, if he hasn&#039;t read the message he&#039;s not coming to the forums frequently. Just my 2 cents.

				good point, I checked and he hasn&#039;t read it yet. Theres another order too, but it&#039;s only 10$. Both have been AWOL since ordering, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Does auto-finalize send me the money or refund it to him?

				@mrroboto187 Yes, undisputed they go to you&nbsp; 20 days (not 30&nbsp; anymore - thanks Silk) later. You wanna bet money one bitcoin value in 3 week?. As a business and not a speculator, I would rather not.
