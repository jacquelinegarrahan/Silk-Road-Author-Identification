				Lottery games are quickly making buyer stats completely worthless.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t yet realized, buyers can essentially make a new account and build up a large number of transactions AND total bitcoin spent -- all while spending very little actual money.<br /><br />I wont give any specific listings or links but there are several lottery games available now with a very low house advantage that let people, for example, &quot;spend&quot; 10 bitcoin but end up getting 9+ of it back. This makes them look like very big legitimate customers to vendors...<br /><br />I hope this isn&#039;t being taken advantage of yet, but if it isn&#039;t it no doubt will be soon. I had second thoughts about one of the lottery listings I made because of this and actually thought about pulling it but someone has already copied the idea and made their own similar listing so that wont solve the problem. For now I just try to monitor users who have high refund rates and seem to be trying to lower them using the lottery and deny them service, but that doesn&#039;t really address the whole issue. Smarter scammers will use the lottery to build up high reputation for near nothing before scamming rather than the other way around.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I should need to mention that if I had a vendetta against any certain vendor, I could create 10 different accounts, pump them all up to very high rankings, and quickly ruin a seller&#039;s reputation, for very little cost except time to myself. Will the admins be able to correctly discern that the vendor is not the scammer when seemingly &quot;10 different people&quot; all with good buyer stats are complaining at once? Maybe. <br /><br />We need some method to see more about the buyer stats, or some type of additional system in place. Quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;People who have all of their spent BTC in a lottery game should not look the same to vendors as people who have actually ordered illegal goods - there is a huge difference in customer credibility there. I hate to say it, but something like Atlantis has done shouldn&#039;t be overlooked at least as a brainstorming point. <br /><br />If not that, maybe just make a specific category in buyer stats that shows what % of that buyer&#039;s spendings were done in the Lotteries &amp; Games category. That way if a vendor gets an order from a buyer that appears to be a &quot;big spender,&quot; they will know it&#039;s only been on lotteries and can be more careful. This seems like at least a good first preventative step to me, without compromising anyone&#039;s anonymity too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;I believe this is something that needs to be addressed quickly, to be frank, which is why I am posting it here.<br /><br />I don&#039;t yet have access to the vendor&#039;s discussion area but I would appreciate if a mod could perhaps move this post there ASAP, as it seems a more appropriate location.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Oh don&#039;t worry plenty of us that play them are getting fucked by not getting paid when we win. I played Walmart&#039;s lottery and lost many times, and he was very quick to want those finalized. So I obliged since I lost. Of course the one time I win, two weeks ago, the fucking excuses start flowing out of this guy. Short on money, he only ships two days a week, then he only ships when he has multiple winners, and then he tries to get you to FE promising &quot;it&#039;s on it&#039;s way.&quot; Haven&#039;t gotten shit from this guy but managed to receive ever other order I have made from as far away as Germany. So while you are so worried about buyer stats, your fellow vendors are doing the same damn thing to pad their stats so that when they fail to pay off the occasional winning bet it hardly affects them to get 1/5 feedback. Vendors abuse it as much as any buyer. Especially the ones running lotteries for products they don&#039;t even have to pay off winners.

				Posted something about lotteries somewhere last night while drunk and correct me if I&#039;m wrong but can a new vendor, start a lottery to gain enough transactions quickly that gets them to the level of transactions required that allows them to request users to FE setting folk up to be scammed?

				Simple solution: full buyer&#039;s feedback (that naturally should include a way to check the type of transactions on both parts).

				Often (usually?), lotteries are bad and people who play them are either stupid or trying to cheat the systems that protect people from scammers. Banning them does not seem like an acceptable strategy on a site that is all about freedom. The freedom to try stupid things is a big part of what SR is all about. Banning vendors who advertise them as a way to boost reputation seems like a good idea. But they would have to be warned and then most would hide their worst advertisements to avoid losing their account(s). The OP of this thread, for instance, seems to have created a great advertisement for their reputation boosting lottery while complaining about how bad it is.<br />Setting up a separate gambling system that does not factor into SR reputation stats might be a good strategy. You can&#039;t just have the vendors voluntarily label their gambling as such to exclude it from affecting stats and expect that to fix the problem, though. It is a challenging problem to solve in a way that does not create a lot of work for admins. A community effort to list the vendors who do it in an attempt to cast dispersions and ridicule upon them is tempting :-). Trying to sort the &quot;bad intentioned&quot; from those who just want to make money from the stupid noobs that can&#039;t wait for a chance to try something stupid repeatedly, would be nearly impossible much of the time. <br />As a vendor, I&#039;d like to be able to see what buyers have purchased in the past. I don&#039;t really think I should be able to see that though. If I could, bad vendors could rename their lottery items as seemingly legit items. It might be nice for SR to have a list of vendors who sell questionable products and then have the stats of a buyer display in a different color based on how much of their purchases came from &quot;bad-listed&quot; vendors? Green-yellow-red might be a scale of trustability for a buyers stats. Sadly that seems very difficult to automate without way too much ongoing work for staff.<br />It is an exciting time to vend on SR, lol :-)

				Lottery vendor chiming in here.<br /><br />While I see the OP&#039;s point ultimately I don&#039;t think they help buyers build up their stats that much as 50 transactions with total spend of $40 in the last month isn&#039;t going to fool any vendor when they look at the breakdown and see lots of tiny $$value purchases<br />Even though I&#039;m sure I offer the best value lottery on the road it&#039;s also still not worth paying 15% (SR commission + hedge&nbsp; + 2% house)&nbsp; just to get your money back playing my games (assuming you play long enough to even out the odds)<br /><br />I&#039;d much rather spend my money on drugs even to build up my feedback but to be honest sometimes I just have a few cents left and say &quot;If I get lucky I&#039;ll buy such and such&quot;<br /><br />If it&#039;s about trying to mask refund rates I&#039;m not even sure are they calculated from amount spent or % of refunded transactions but either way It should be up to SR to make sure that the refund rate calculation is based on relevant figures<br /><br />One thing&nbsp; I would like to see is the scam lottery&#039;s got rid of and by that I mean the ones who have no independent variable that chooses the winner such as the last digit of the TX# . Many vendor lotteries for drugs just say they will pick someone at random and I wonder how often is that &quot;someone random&quot; just a shill account of theirs&nbsp; :-\ :-\

				I think the best solution would be to update the buyer feedback to display to vendors what the transation were for.<br /><br />Was it drugs? Or lotteries? <br /><br />That alone would help me who I want to deal with and who I don&#039;t want to deal with I would think.<br /><br />

				there have always been ways to dodge buyer stats. it&#039;s nothing new really. what do you think all the ebooks are for? it&#039;s not like anyone actually reads that rubbish. total spend is only a bit harder

Banning them does not seem like an acceptable strategy on a site that is all about freedom. The freedom to try stupid things is a big part of what SR is all about. Banning vendors who advertise them as a way to boost reputation seems like a good idea. But they would have to be warned and then most would hide their worst advertisements to avoid losing their account(s). The OP of this thread, for instance, seems to have created a great advertisement for their reputation boosting lottery while complaining about how bad it is.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If I&#039;m not mistaken you just subtly recommended to ban me.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Warn you first and ban you if you continue to show intent to subvert the feedback system vendors use to protect themselves from scammers, yes. I really don&#039;t mean to pick on you specifically.

You can&#039;t just have the vendors voluntarily label their gambling as such to exclude it from affecting stats and expect that to fix the problem, though. It is a challenging problem to solve in a way that does not create a lot of work for admins. A community effort to list the vendors who do it in an attempt to cast dispersions and ridicule upon them is tempting :-). Trying to sort the &quot;bad intentioned&quot; from those who just want to make money from the stupid noobs that can&#039;t wait for a chance to try something stupid repeatedly, would be nearly impossible much of the time.<br />&nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So I take it you have a very puritanical view on gambling. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Not really. True fair gambling with no noticeable &quot;house&quot; advantage does not bother me unless it is used in a way that is not fair. I have seen a lot of online &quot;gambling&quot; used to trick the unsuspecting out of their $ with lose-lose opportunities and scams. Terrible odds that are not clearly stated also bother me.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187125.msg1362317#msg1362317">Quote from: Cork1Screw on July 21, 2013, 04:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187125.msg1359204#msg1359204">Quote from: NW Nugz on July 20, 2013, 03:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">As a vendor, I&#039;d like to be able to see what buyers have purchased in the past. I don&#039;t really think I should be able to see that though. If I could, bad vendors could rename their lottery items as seemingly legit items. It might be nice for SR to have a list of vendors who sell questionable products and then have the stats of a buyer display in a different color based on how much of their purchases came from &quot;bad-listed&quot; vendors? Green-yellow-red might be a scale of trustability for a buyers stats. Sadly that seems very difficult to automate without way too much ongoing work for staff.<br />It is an exciting time to vend on SR, lol :-)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think seeing what buyers have purchased in the past, at least in some capacity, is certainly one way of solving the problem. You say that you don&#039;t think that should happen because &quot;bad vendors could rename their lottery items as seemingly legit items,&quot; but I don&#039;t really understand your point there. As far as I am aware, you cannot edit the title of listings. Everything else, but not the title. I may be mistaken of course but this is my knowledge of it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The problem is you could make a new listing for, say, an OZ of weed at $280. Then you tell people to buy that if they want to bet $280 on your lotto and have their stats look great. If you still don&#039;t get what I&#039;m saying, that&#039;s probably a good thing.<br />

				hi hi<br /><br />i dunno about ya&#039;ll, but for me, before i even begin to look at the buyer&#039;s name or address i check out the stats. ALWAYS. after that, it&#039;s copy paste to search for blacklist.<br /><br />if all checks out then it&#039;s good to look at address and ship.<br /><br />if those stats arent grooving with me then i&#039;m cancelling. that includes lottery players with 80 transactions for a total of 200$ spent. that&#039;s clearly BS and i know it as such. i&#039;m more interested in the buyer&#039;s AVERAGE price per transaction. that will paint me a &quot;truer&quot; picture of the buyer than simply total sales.&nbsp; IMHO, total sales is and always has been BS. AVG price is the way to go<br /><br />i still think it would be ideal to have a separate listing &quot;type&quot; for lotto specifically, as i had suggested in feature req forum, however this would require a fair bit of work on SR&#039;s part since all the odds would have to be done via the site to maintain fairness. and the order/feedback system would need to be slightly modified for those tickets too.<br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb
