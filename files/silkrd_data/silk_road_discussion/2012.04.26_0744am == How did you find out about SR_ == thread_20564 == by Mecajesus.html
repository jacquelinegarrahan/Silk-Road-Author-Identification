				I found out about it in &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; magazine, I think it was the November, or October issue. So glad I took my car in to the shop that day, I don&#039;t ever read the magazine, but I was bored while waiting on my car and picked the magazine up, then there was a small article on a website, which described about a website that you can buy any drugs anonymously.<br /><br />I probably would of never found out about it if I never went to that place.<br />

				My dealer told me about it but he was too nervous to try it. I maned up and did some research and the rest is history! Probably not a good move on his part, I was a good customer hahahah<br />But that is part of the allure of SR. I have never had an unpleasant transaction

				While back I bought a 5850 off some dude from our local classifieds, he then explained bitcoins to me and mining them... Well I started mining small... Then came across info about SR on some bitcoin forum... <br /><br /><br />went from 2 Gpu&#039;s before SR to 15 GPU&#039;s mining after Silkroad was found :)
