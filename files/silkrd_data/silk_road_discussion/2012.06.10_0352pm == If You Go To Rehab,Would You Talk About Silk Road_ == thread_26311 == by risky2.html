				I&#039;m dedicating this post to PriscillaMarie90, since she&#039;s in rehab. Hope she comes back fine, and back to her funny old self (Hell, I probably gave her like half her positive karma by myself, lol).<br /><br />Ok first off I&#039;m high on speed as I write this (so that&#039;s why the speed movie quote reference in the question, get it? ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;I know, I&#039;m a goofy fuck, heh ). So please excuse any rambling or wall of text. That said, I thought about what I would do if I was in rehab. Would I tell about silk road or not?<br /><br />I voted on it depends for myself. It would depend if I was there at my choice of &quot;hitting rock bottom&quot;, or if some outside force like the law or family , friends, etc.&nbsp; would send me there. If there by my choice, I would spill the beans cause I would really want to quit. But if I knew I was going to use once I got out, and forced to be there, I would lie, or only tell some fellows, cause lets face it, rehab leaves you with a lot of time to talk. I&#039;ve never been to rehab myself, but I&#039;ve watched a lot of shows like celebrity rehab, etc.<br /><br />You know, I would think DPR and the SR staff would like you to tell all about Silk Road to your fellow patients in rehab. Hell, Its new customers that are ripe to spend, lol. But seriously I could see that some patients ( or inmates) wouldn&#039;t tell at all, so that they could use Silk Road again in the future someday if they choose to.<br /><br />So I&#039;m just curious how you fellow readers would vote. Feel free to post a rely here further explaining your vote choice. I&#039;m keeping the vote open for 10 days (cause I think 10 days is about my limit for milking the topic, lol).<br /><br />

				For me, it depends on who it was.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t tell anyone &quot;official&quot; (law enforcement or, more probably the workers at the rehab clinic), but if there were some people there that asked, as long as they didn&#039;t look too bad (like, teeth falling out from smoking too much crystal), I wouldn&#039;t have a problem telling peers. PEERS but not OFFICIALS.

I have been through rehab. I was mandated by court. Obviously it didn&#039;t work. I was clean for two years though and I decided to go back to using. Never did I speak of SR. No one needs to know that... SR is blowing up enough as it is. Relax on the discussion about it.--Just my opinion I suppose.

				Do you still have doctor patient confidentiality at rehab? If so, I probably would talk about it. Unless it was some bullshit court-ordered rehab, in which case I&#039;d smile, tell them I believe in God and get the fuck outta there asap!

				If you&#039;re in rehab you need help , you&#039;de need to admit that to yourself if you want to move forward with your life . Admiting you got your drugs from S/R is a small thing in the grand scheme of things . Yes loyalty is a great trait but lets face it , this site has has worldwide media coverage , its hidden , encypted , only via tor and uses crytographic currency . Its well equiped to look after itself .&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry if this go&#039;s against the flow of the thread but just my view .<br /><br />HH

I have only had bad experiences when I have told people about Silk Road or told them I get drugs online. After many bad experiences I conceal my use of SR and I go out of my way so people dont figure out that sometimes I order my drugs online. The anti-drug nuts always convolute information and mold half truths to the image they want to send.

				I just wanted to clarify that first choice about &quot;spilling the beans&quot;, I meant with that option just telling a rehab how Silk Road generally works without giving up &quot;personal account details&quot; or other sensitive information up. Some set-up details like you would find off of a wiki- how to- page, but NOT individual details of like what your account name is, or what exact order amounts you buy from or anything like that. That specific kind of information given up would be snitching and would be wrong to talk about in rehab ( or anywhere in a public setting). I didn&#039;t mean to imply that talking about was to be &quot;turning snitch or informant.&quot; or &quot;selling fellow Silk Road users out&quot; or stuff along those lines. I did not want to go that route at all. Uggg, man, a can of worms can be a mess ::) lol. <br /><br />And let&#039;s remember I&#039;m talking about a rehab, not jail itself or some probation halfway house work program thing. I guess you could have a rehab section in a jail or some security facility, but I meant a place like the example I gave earlier of the &quot;celebrity rehab&quot; TV show. That sort of place.<br /><br />Umm Maybe that first option should be changed to something like &quot;leaving Silk Road forever&quot; or deleting your silk road account and related programs ? Some option that would not be seen with a&#039; turning traitor&#039; aspect?<br /><br />Anyways, sorry if that original option came off like that.<br /><br />&nbsp;So it seems the rule for talking about Silk Road in the real world is.....&quot;Denial, It&#039;s not just a river in Egypt.&quot; lol.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Silk Road? What&#039;s that? Never heard of it!&quot;<br /><br />EDIT: Tried to change some options on voting....&nbsp; ( heh maybe a escape from rehab option would be better :P)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Yeah, they would explore more the reasons why you might be on drugs, rather than exactly where you got the drugs. But it seems they would have group discussions, and everyone would give &#039;drug stories&#039; about what drugs and how often, and what triggers a use, and all that. So where you got your drugs could be discussed in some manner by someone as a topic. But it probably depends on how they run the rehab, if they explore the where question that deeply or not.

				I agree with happyhippy.<br /><br />If I&#039;m in rehab on my own accord, I will be honest with my doctors (doctor-patient confidentiality is there right?). Silkroad has enough media coverage... I learnt about the site when I was talking to some guy in a 12 player starcraft II game, and he was like &quot;if your dealer sucks, check out silkroad&quot;.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t name any names... that is plain fucking stupid, you wouldn&#039;t do that if you were buying on the street... you won&#039;t do it buying online (or at least, you better not - on the street, you can run and hide. piss off enough people online and you&#039;re fucked)<br /><br />And for those people that think silkroad is well hidden:<br /><br />http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)<br /><br />http://www.topix.com/forum/drug/valium/T4TNSIU63JU5N0RM0<br /><br />http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/drugs-bought-with-virtual-cash-20110611-1fy0a.html<br /><br /><br /><br />So the idiots who think they&#039;re being all cool and shit by not talking about the site itself are only just kidding themselves. The government knows, the police know, the postal workers know. It&#039;s just too hard to bring silkroad down.<br /><br />If the feds also started using bitcoins, then it would be much harder since they can monitor transactions, but it wouldn&#039;t be impossible. :/
