				Looking to buy some BTC online and have been trying to do some homework.&nbsp; I made an account with MT.GOX and then ran across a few different sites like BTKOIN.com offering way better BTC:USD ratios. Can anyone provide any personal testimony about BTKoin? Prefer to use this Debit gift card I have ....<br /><br />Thanks

Really man, they&#039;ve had a lot of customers from these forums. And they&#039;re always making sure we have the link, by posting it several times a day. Honestly, with this being the forum for a drug-trading website like Silk Road, I don&#039;t see why you should have any worries about a company that markets their stuff here. A lack of personal liability or traceability is no reason not to trust them. And again, they&#039;ve had SO many customers from people on these forums.
