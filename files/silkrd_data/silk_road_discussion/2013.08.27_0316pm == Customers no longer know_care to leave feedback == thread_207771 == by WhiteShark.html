				Im finding a bit difficult for sure! I left feedback earlier and I could only use the predetermined comments, no way to leave my own feedback, so I left it in the Discussions for the vendor, which I assume is the way to roll on here with feedback now?<br /><br />I also had an FE early I wanted to update, but you can no longer edit old feedback it seems!

				As someone who has worked on other legal platforms where feedback is optional let me the first to say nobody bothers unless you annoy them to leave feedback over and over again.<br />Hopefully because the context here is different and arguably more important people will be more likely to review but I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath for anything over 25%

				Damn, I was wondering why I received no feedback from my last 5 or so transactions. <br /><br />One buyer let me know before finalizing that he was going to be leaving positive feedback for sure, but he did not, so is it possible that people just can&#039;t for the life of them figure out how to navigate to the proper place to leave feedback?

				it was a bit confusing for me at first. once you leave your 1-5 rating it just takes you to the homepage without prompting you to leave any review. I did not realize right away that I needed to go to the sellers page to do so....and even then the &quot;review&quot; link is small and blends in with the other options (message, become a fan, etc) Perhaps if this link could be in red or above the other links, somehow making it stand out a little bit, people would have an easier time? Once everyone realizes this is how to do it, it shouldn&#039;t be a problem but with newbies coming on everyday I think making it stand out a little bit or at least having the prompt there after you leave your 1-5 rating might increase the feedback.<br /><br />Another reason I would not leave feedback right away now is because they are permanent. So for instances where I am unable to test the product right away I have just finalized, left my number rating, and will then wait to write an actual review once I have tested the product. Unfortunately for some things I won&#039;t be able to test for quite a while. I feel bad about this but as long as I have paid the vendor &amp; given a number rating I think it is fair to wait to write a review until I have tried the product, as there will be no way to change it.&nbsp; Doing it this way I am able to leave the best review I possibly can &amp; try to speak with the vendor personally before writing if I have any issues.&nbsp; Some people may choose to wait to even put a number rating now also for the same reasons.&nbsp; If I have received my product, of course I want to pay you but if anything were to go wrong &amp; I have given you 5/5 &amp; a great review, what happens for me now? I like to leave a well rounded review discussing the good/bad of packaging, shipping time, communications if needed with vendor &amp; product itself, and I don&#039;t feel I can do this immediately if I haven&#039;t tested the product &amp; am unable to edit/add to a review later.<br />If it is a seller I have dealt with many times &amp; i know is consistent or a product that I don&#039;t need to test or can test right away I will release funds &amp; review at the same time. Does this seem reasonable to vendors? Are your customers releasing funds &amp; leaving you a number rating at least? Maybe they are waiting a few days to review until they have tried the products too?<br /><br />Something I would like to ask the vendors is how do you feel about the discussion section &amp; what would you like your buyers to use this for? For vendors I have purchased from many times or had a particularly good experience with, when I see they have 0 discussion I am inclined to write something there, even though I have already left a positive review.&nbsp; With the new changes everyone&#039;s feedback is not as readily visible so having some positive discussion (even if similar to a review) is a good thing right? I think my stats are pretty decent so hopefully me saying something positive in this section will help out vendors I really like &amp; help confused newbies to feel more confident? I&#039;d love to hear what the sellers would like this section to be used for so I can make sure I am using it properly. So far I have mostly seen it used for complaints or when buyers have been unable to get a personal message responded to by the seller. I don&#039;t think it should be used as just a negative space but I&#039;m not sure if it should be just another review section either....what do you guys think?&nbsp; <br />I may make this last paragraph into a new post to try to get more feedback on this.&nbsp;

				DPR &amp; Crew:<br /><br />It would be easy to add a &quot;review&quot; link to each item on the orders page that would take the user to the proper place to review the order. Pending review simply becomes another state of a purchase. Perhaps with explicit options to review or skip the review. Maybe have them drop off the list 30 days after finalization if they don&#039;t review?<br /><br />You might even order purchases by processing, in transit, pending review...

Thank GOD i saw the review button(only described as &quot;a link&quot;&nbsp; on the wiki,i thought i was looking for a http://..... kind of link and that i missed my window of opportunity to get the link&nbsp; &gt;:()<br /><br />-Some buyers,usually happy ones are not motivated enough to exercise their right/duty.<br />Just like on this forum people are quicker to hand out negative karma and barely take the effort to give positive karma even when deserved.<br /><br /><br />~~~SUGGESTIONS~~~<br /><br />&nbsp;- Perhaps implement&nbsp; code to inform the buyer which ratings/reviews the buyer has left blank.That would also be an opportunity to inform new/uniformed buyers on how the feedback-procedure works.<br /><br />-Since i hate it when buyers are to lazy to rate/review a warning/message should be accompagnied with the feedback procedure to remind them to fill it in EVEN/especially when satisfied as this helps their vendor and makes it possible/easier for the vendor to continue to offer the product they desire in the future.

				DPR&nbsp; !! As I stated before&nbsp; dont fix something that isnt broken! Please revert the review system this is garbage and will cripple the road as a whole... I have many customer&#039;s who are foreign or new and often have difficulty even using the site... Why make it even more complicated.. And as nice as it all looks it clutters up the page no one wants to look at the top spenders review.. who cares?<br /><br />Old review system worked for the last few years... why change it???<br /><br />PLEASE DPR change it back!&nbsp; I haven&#039;t gotten any reviews at all recently as the other vendors noted.<br /><br />I love the other changes (minus the FEE&#039;s % going up)&nbsp; but please change it back to the old system before it starts to damage the community.. the longer it&#039;s like this the larger of a gap in review history every vendor will have!! Dont let there be a week of missing reviews as a buyer I know this makes a vendor look bad!

				All in all I am liking the new system more and more. It appears that vendors who go above and beyond for their customers will get a 5/5 rating and customers will take the time to leave good reviews and good words on the discussion page. <br /><br />Go above and beyond, and customers will do the same.<br /><br />WS

				I noticed it too. The change went into affect about 5 days after I made my vendor account, and prior to that only 2 people were able to leave reviews under the old system. However now that I&#039;m seeing that I am not the only one not getting reviews, I&#039;m thinking maybe reviews won&#039;t matter as much in the future. Maybe people will just adjust their buying habits according to the vendors score, and not rely on reviews as much anymore. Maybe if something exceptional was to happen, you will get an occasional review. Kind of like Amazon works I guess.

				EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Too bad very few people seem to do it. There has to be a way to encourage buyers to update their feedback to reflect product quality and effectiveness. Right now I think very few buyers even know the option exists let alone how to actually update their existing feedback. Some sort of simple note about this should be displayed to buyers every time they make a purchase and leave their initial feedback.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=207771.msg1498482#msg1498482">Quote from: maligan on August 28, 2013, 11:21 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Editing feedback is very important !

				A simple solution is to have a info box that informs everyone that feedback can only be put in once, &amp; is final and cannot be updated, but if they are not ready to leave a final feedback have several boxes that best describes their situation that will give a generated statement saying maybe; received goods, waiting to try &amp; give final feedback, or like a dumbass I FE&#039;d,&nbsp; Or what ever DPR comes up with that has a little more ingenuity than what was used to describe the 1/5 - 5/5!<br />If there was a potential problem with the order you could check the box that says waiting to work out the kinks in the order, will finalize feedback later.&nbsp; Anyway something along these lines could work.&nbsp; Leave the 5/5 ratings only upgradeable, so they could never lower the rating, only upgrade it, &amp; if in 30 days they don&#039;t go into change or finish their feedback, it would automatically go to 5.0/5 as the default.<br /><br />The rating system should have at least a tenth added to it so it could be an almost perfect order being a 4.9/5 which would make it easier to give realistic scores rather than knocking a vendor down 20% on a almost perfect transaction.&nbsp; Also keep the (100) with the vendor&#039;s name to give a quick snapshot of how they are handling their business instead of grading on the bell curve &amp; dumbing down the field &amp; making ALL the top vendors look average<br /><br />Make some more succinctly written guidelines to best describe how the feedback ratings should be used . . .&nbsp; like taking usps out of the picture when an order was sent priority but took 9 days, you can&#039;t hold that over the head of a vendor.&nbsp; Or if an order doesn&#039;t make it through &amp; it ends up with a 50/50 resolution, that the vendor gets a 3/5 for it. <br /><br />There are more tweaks that would help, but that&#039;s all for now!<br /><br /><br />NCK

				I dont find leaving fee back to be the issue at all. I just dont like how you cant changed your rating or anything. Thus lets say you have to FE for a vendor, you have t leave a five then you can write in the feed back FE will update.<br /><br />But say that never comes or the vendor gives you shit you can change the review but not the score, I find that some what irritating.

				I can&#039;t speak for anyone else, but I always try to leave a detailed review and feedback both on the vendor/transaction page and in the forums. I don&#039;t hide my name when doing so either. The only times I have left fairly nondescript feedback was for products that really don&#039;t require it. ( I bought 200 2&quot;x2&quot; ziplock bags from one vendor... left feedback about the communication and shipping speed, but it&#039;s a legal product so no stealth or product quality stuff needed.) On products like psychedelics where I might not be testing them for a while, I make sure I leave detailed feedback about the experience I had with the vendor, as well as how the product looks, smells, reacts to testing kits, etc. If I am not testing when I receive, I make sure to note in my feedback that I will be leaving detailed reports on the forum.<br /><br />As I said, I do all of this without hiding my username or using an alias. I want to be known as a buyer that will always be polite, but always tell the truth. If I receive substandard product, I will say so. If I receive a great product, I will say that as well. <br />&nbsp;( I will however, always leave a 5/5 rating for a product I have received with no problems. Hey, we are buying drugs off the internet, if they show up... Cool!) <br />I will always contact a vendor first with any problems that I have and I will not enter resolution unless right down to the wire. <br />( And unless things have gotten ugly, I will always first request more time for the transaction before finalizing.)<br />I will always try to write in a calm and informed manner without flaming or trolling, and will above all remain THANKFUL to the great vendors here that enables me to buy the drugs I love, without having to deal in person with the people that sell those drugs where I live!<br /><br />With respect<br />Firewater

				I found it useful to be able to update your feedback so that you can give feedback on the product itself rather than the vendor. For example, if the stealth and shipping etc. was all fine then for the vendor&#039;s sake I want to leave 5/5 and say that it was good, but I might not try the product for a while. This means very few reviews mention how good the product was because they are written before the product was used.<br /><br />I&#039;m still an advocate of separate reviews/ratings for the vendor and the product. Your primary concern when buying is that you will receive the product and not get scammed, and this is what is mainly covered by the current review system. But it would be nice if we could give separate feedback for the quality of the product (and also if the vendors were not too sensitive to non-perfect feedback, e.g. if it was out of 100 and you gave 95/100 because not everything will be the best ever). I guess this is what the forum has historically covered, and now the new discussions pages might be good for that.

				I&#039;m fairly new but have to admit I preferred the old feedback system. That said, I think it&#039;s important to keep other potential buyers informed as to who they may choose to spend money with so will do what I can to leave pertinent feedback personally.<br /><br />I have noticed that people are using the discuss tab to make up for where feedback is currently falling short, and I think that is a brilliant move.

				When I used to buy on SR, I read and relied heavily on feedback comments to help me determine whether or not to buy from a vender.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think most venders would agree that they make a HUGE difference in our sales.&nbsp; People want to know what other buyers experience was, and most make an informed decision based on what the feedback said. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been extremely dissappointed with buyers not leaving any feedback as well!&nbsp; Oot of eight orders finalized this weekend, only THREE left feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think something must be changed to ensure people do leave feedback!&nbsp; As a vender who puts a lot of time and energy into customer service, not having buyers leave feedback about their experience is really a dis-service.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can ask buyers to leave feedback, but think that most customers shouldn&#039;t need to be pestered to leave feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />The old feedback system was way more informative IMHO.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see a blend of the old and the new to re-gain the benefits of detailed feedback.

				I think the system is just going to take a little time for people to get used to. In the end it will be a useful tool for buyers. The old way was not helpful at all as the rating could not be relied on. <br /><br />I hope they start letting vendors leave reviews soon. Then if a buyer doesn&#039;t leave a timely review the vendor can say so when reviewing the buyer.<br /><br />People will get used to the new 1-5 system as well. The way it was working was every buyer had no choice but to leave a 5/5. Most just said FE 5/5 and nothing else. <br /><br />In time I am sure vendors and buyers will see benefits with the new set up as stellar vendors rep will shine above others. <br /><br />The thing I don&#039;t like is that some peoples reviews are worth more than others and people my be inclined to abuse that privilege.

				less than 20% of customers are leaving ratings/reviews within the first week after receiving their product, but by 7-8-9 days post-finalizing, more than 80% ARE leaving ratings and reviews. <br />20% not leaving ratings/reviews beyond 10 days after the deal is done is a dramatic negative change from the previous system.<br />20% of buyers have withdrawn from a foundational and fundamental part of the way SR works after only 2 weeks.

				As a buyer, I now have to write down (type in a secure place) what I want my review to say (shipping time, communication, etc) then leave the feedback after I&#039;ve actually tried the product. It&#039;s kind of a pain in the ass ya, but more importantly, it&#039;s less relevant by time I actually leave the feedback. It&#039;s also a bit of a security issue because I basically have proof of past purchases on my computer without even logging into SR.

				I suppose I&#039;m shy, and I also suspect that I&#039;m not alone, but I generally don&#039;t like being forced to provide written feedback on sites like EBay and Amazon. If everything was satisfactory I&#039;m happy to leave a numerical rating but I start to tense up at the very thought of actually having to write words. With the few purchases I&#039;ve made here so far, though, I&#039;ve left short reviews or intend to do so soon. My willingness to do so, however, might in large part be due to the novelty of the SR experience and I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to keep it up for all transactions in future.

				I always leave ratings + feedback. However I only do it after I test out the product, not when I finalize.<br /><br />I think as customers we really need to have more people leave some type of review so we can weed out the bad/good sellers. <br /><br />From the great vendors I have ordered from they put alot of work in their stealth/gear and getting stuff over safely,the least we can do is take 2 minutes out of our life to leave them a review.

				shit Ill be the only person to actually admit that my past 3 or 4 orders I didn&#039;t write reviews just because of laziness,&nbsp; But to be honest, these are vendors who have been long time vendors, (all more than a year), with 300+ transactions, and i really didnt think they cared at all bc i of course left 5/5, but Im gonna write reviews for all them right now.&nbsp; good thing I saw this thread.

				Don&#039;t forget to count in the number of people who get caught, the number or accounts phished, and stuff like that. It probably won&#039;t affect it so much overall bu just recently I made an order for 3 G&#039;s of weed and 30MG of Ativan and it just got here but some asshole on Wiki changed the Commercial Forum&#039;s link to Silk Road to a phishing link or something, so now I can&#039;t finalize or review.
