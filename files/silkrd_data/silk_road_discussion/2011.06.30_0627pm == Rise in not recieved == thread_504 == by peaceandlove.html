				Have any sellers noticed a rise in buyers saying that they haven&#039;t received their orders? I have a high level of feedback and success in shipping orders without any issues however, I have noticed more and more saying that orders haven&#039;t arrived and looking for refunds. <br /><br />Now I do realize that sometimes orders don&#039;t make it and that&#039;s fine, or if there was a disimprovement in my shipping methods but it seems to me that some buyers want their cake and to get it for free. Legit buyers will know that they&#039;ll get a better service and cheaper goods if a system can be reached whereby scam buyers are weeded out.<br /><br />

				In my opinion, They should provide a love letter to you before busting that common move. they can upload the love letter to you for verification.then they should be entitled to half the money back only.you can even ring the number on the love letter and check if its legit(they may have photoshop skills).lol....

				This is one of my top concerns as well. I was thinking that it might be a good idea to have&nbsp; a buyers feedback. But, If a buyer is out to scam, it&#039;s really easy to make a new account. With this business we will never have a perfect system, but we can and should implement all safety measures possible for both the vendor and seller.<br /><br />I understand that its much more riskier for a buyer but vendors have their risks as well. It shouldn&#039;t be too hard to figure out a way to minimize risk for all.

				I think that I may have to implement a system whereby I use delivery confirmation that is no signature but you get notified it was dropped off. It costs more so prices will rise. <br /><br />For those that wish to get cheaper I could send regularly but at their risk. As I can&#039;t afford to lose to scammers and it&#039;s unfair on real buyers.

				i think thats the way forward pal..... buyers own risk if he wants it via regular mail.would be nice is there was a thread on here with the different mailing options that each country offers... i had a lookie at royal mail(uk), i couldnt see any domestic options for tracking mail without signing though :-\&nbsp; but i did see an international mailing option that can track post without signing.....<br /><br />at the end of the day,a seller ideally doesnt want to step foot in a post office due to cameras,but imo that is a bit extreme being that paranoid,considering how much shit gets sent directly from post offices anyways...a disguise can fix shit up nicely too....i dunnoo....but a change is needed or else sellers are just gonna be giving shit away for free.....lol...and also more importantly at the end of the day,buyers must not sign for shit,no matter what,so a mailing option that offers tracking without signing is win win for all...<br /><br />

				That is how Im sending mine out. Its called delivery confirmation. No one has to sign for it, you just have to make sure that you send it &#039;no signature required&quot;. All it says is that the package has been delivered. Another vendor told me to do this and it seems like a great way to go. You do have to pay extra for it. Right now, Im including it the cost...

				I placed an order with a vendor whom later got back to me around 2.5 weeks later saying that due to unforeseen circumstances it was not coming. This happened with the same vendor to 30+ people so I am sure that is contributing to the increase. The next order I placed used priority mail with a tracking # much better system and they do not require a signature. So much more convenient as you know exactly when to expect the package and the seller knows exactly when you got it. I would gladly pay extra for this security as a buyer.

				I put Delivery Confirmation on all my shipments to sellers in case someone claims it wasn&#039;t delivered.<br /><br />It costs less than a buck more per package, there&#039;s no signature required, and you don&#039;t have to go into the post office to mail it that way.&nbsp; They have the DCN stickers sitting out some places and you can take them for free.&nbsp; Just slap it on the front of your package and you just have to have the correct postage when you mail.&nbsp; Each sticker has a number that you can track online.

				Delivery confirmation is a vital tool for SR sellers to not get reverse-scammed.<br />I know the second the package arrives (No signature required)<br /><br />If sellers are extra worried, you can always track your delivery through Tor.<br />Also remember, The green delivery confirmation slips are NOT tracking.<br />They just tell you when it arrives, sometimes a few things in between.<br />The only packages that provide real tracking are Express Mail.

				Those statistics were recovered from a buyers account.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty easy to work out as the transaction ID is incremental.&nbsp; Addresses in sellers section are automatically deleted after they are used, if a seller would like the option of deleting the address earlier then they should be able to.&nbsp; Although it shouldn&#039;t matter as we are all encrypting messages and address detailswith PGP aren&#039;t we&nbsp; ;)

Buyers on the other hand, can simply make a new account for each purchase. Your system does not work.<br /><br />Instead of buyer feedback, a buyer should just have two simple numbers: successful purchases / total purchases. e.g. (4/5) 5 buys, 4 successful.

				I don&#039;t have a problem with that one, performance...I just want all of us to realze, that *most* of us are after the same thing...avoiding heat and scams, and doing our damndest to avoid LE...anything reasonable is fine by me...but anything that smacks of paranoia or attempts to pit one side against the other I&#039;m going to fight.&nbsp; Again: I haven&#039;t *heard* of all these beatdowns of sellers by buyers...it&#039;s too much trouble, and there is nothing to keep you from posting the buyer&#039;s name on here, and since it takes a whole lot of time and energy to get btc, I just don&#039;t think this is that big a problem...dope rip off artists are opportunists, same as thieves, and aren&#039;t going to go to all that trouble, just to get over on some btc...are sellers really getting ripped off this way?&nbsp; Or are you just afraid it *could* happen...I&#039;ve had 3 sellers didn&#039;t come thru this week, as they said they would...all 3 have responded, explained, and I&quot;m totally cool with that...last thing I want is to loose the few good sellers we have...we communicate, and watch each other&#039;s back...way it should be...<br /><br />Reasonable plan to shift out scammers is fine...but escrow is the appeal of this site, and why Black Market&#039;s first foray was horrible.&nbsp; I&#039;m going about 50-50 for good sellers/bad sellers, and I&#039;ve yet to post bad feedback...make it harder to sign up, make new *buyers* bid to become buyers too, I&#039;m fine with any of that...just don&#039;t start private forums...it&#039;s scary enough *knowing* LE is reading every word I post...only safe guard is we all read everything, and I want to keep it that way...most reputable buyers see us all in the same boat, and don&#039;t see it as &#039;us againt you&#039;...we have enough real enemies...again: we face prison time, and are easier to catch than sellers...we don&#039;t want on your bad side...

				Its also worth considering that this could be a law enforcement tactic to help drive out the sellers. Order from them, gather intelligence on their packaging methods, then report not receiving in order to drive up costs, discourage sellers, etc...

				Well, everybody who&#039;s ever been in this game--and I include all LE reading this too--knows that LE depends upon buyers getting busted, and giving up their sellers.&nbsp; Rats/informants are vital to what they do.&nbsp; Here it just can&#039;t happen,and that must be infuriating...but they&#039;ve also been known just to bust a bunch of buyers in some neighborhoods, to shut down markets: NYC in the eighties...and I&quot;m more inclined to think that *that* would be their aim: set up as fake seller, and nail a bunch of buyers, word gets out, blah blah blah...<br /><br />The *last* thing they want to do is have some kind of trial, where btc and SR get brought in, as no one can explain it worth a damn, and can you imagine some jury trying to sift thru all this ha ha ha...<br /><br />We&#039;ll see....<br /><br />Back to topic: SR is like what Winston Churchill wrote about democracy, which is that it is the worst system of gov&#039;t except for all the others...<br /><br />Leave SR alone...none of the sellers I know claim they are getting rip off scams...who is?

Reputable sources have let it be known that USPS has a fingerprinting system that flags a pack if you check it with a known tor exit node/other open proxies.
