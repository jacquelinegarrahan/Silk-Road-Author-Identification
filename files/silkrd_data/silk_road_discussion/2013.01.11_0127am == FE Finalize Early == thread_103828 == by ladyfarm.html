				I have been asked to finalize early and write a comment on someones<br />review page but I can&#039;t find anywhere to do that and I&#039;m worries<br />that I won&#039;t receive my shipment. I&#039;m a first timer. Any advise?<br />The seller is Frank Mathews. I guess I could just wait and see what <br />happens. He seems to have a very good Rep though a bit brash.

				Get your butt in the rumor forum and do some reading. Use the search button on the top right corner.<br /><br />All us buyers just love to FE ;) <br />As a new user it&#039;s going to be pretty tough for a while. Take your time, or loose money.<br /><br />Read my sig.

				As a new buyer you will be asked to FE by the majority of Vendors... well that has certainly been my experience.&nbsp; I have had to FE on 5 or my 6 orders and only one didn&#039;t show up.&nbsp; Im not sure if those odds are acceptable for you but my humble advice to you would be:<br /><br />1. Research who you intend to buy from on these forums, it will a very well spent hour or so of your time<br />2. order small for your first few orders until you get some buyer stats and a feel for the process<br />3. don&#039;t spend any more BC than you are prepared to gamble and lose<br /><br />Best of luck, hope it works out to be an enjoyable experience for you.<br /><br />Happy Friday&nbsp; ;D

				Thats very good advice.<br />If you are buying small you should be able to find vendors who don&#039;t require FE. Depends on the drug.
