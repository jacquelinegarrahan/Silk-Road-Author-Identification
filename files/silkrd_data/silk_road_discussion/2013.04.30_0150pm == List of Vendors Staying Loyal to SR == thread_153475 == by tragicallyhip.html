That being said, yes, he probably would pull in 10x with SR&#039;s current market. But people with good buyer stats should be able to reserve their right to not finalize early. They can refuse to deal with vendors that require FE. There is policies implemented to try to make this place run as smoothly as it can.

				While we are all about a free market and competition, we will NOT be participating in any other market place until SR is restored to its former glory. <br /><br />While there is no proof of anything, we can&#039;t help but feel (admittedly a gut instinct) that this is a SR rival and not a political stance that has brought SR down.<br /><br />Once SR is up and running smoothly we would again visit the other markets and weigh if they have any advantage to our business.<br /><br />With that said we are preparing to set up an independent venture (until SR is back) <br />All orders that we have currently in SR escrow will remain there.

				We totally behind Silk Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its a little sad, we just paid our vendor fee last week ($570.)&nbsp; and haven&#039;t cashed anything out yet. We are broke and out of gas money, seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />We will stay loyal to our buyers, where ever they want to go.&nbsp; We support DPR 100% and have left lots of money in escrow and in our account they can use to help fund the counter attack.&nbsp; We are also willing to pay DPR even extra money on top of that&nbsp; to help fund a counter attack.&nbsp; Whatever it takes to get us back on.&nbsp; <br /><br />The fact that there is no contingency plan in place for this is disturbing.&nbsp; All businesses have a disaster plan just in case.&nbsp; It seems our only option is to bunker down and take the hits to face.&nbsp; There really shoud have been a plan in place all along to address this.&nbsp; Its good business sense and good leadership to plan for the future.&nbsp; We would have a solution by now.<br /><br />Our contingency plan for this business is to continue selling to our customers at all costs.&nbsp; Websites / landlords /storefronts&nbsp; come and go, but its the customers who are the center of all of this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not vendors, loyalty, or DRP. . its the customers.&nbsp; That&#039;s all.&nbsp; Its them we want to please the most.&nbsp; At the same time, we want to show our loyalty to DPR.&nbsp; Can it be done?&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I am loyal and I am a true Libertarian.&nbsp; My loyalty lies with my customers and serving them the best I can.&nbsp; That&#039;s my job.&nbsp; <br /><br />If a fire is burning and the town firetruck has a flat tire do you sit there and try to manufacture a new tire on the road?&nbsp; <br />Why not just call another fire truck (backup plan) from another nearby town, its just temporary until the fire is out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it the fireman or the people in the burning building that we are helping here?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />What is this all about?&nbsp; &nbsp;Supporting the technicians for the site, or supporting the buyers who are threatening to buy elsewhere?&nbsp; <br />The technicians are paid already, and tthey have the required funds to hire more techies and buy more networks and domains to put this to rest.&nbsp; <br /><br />We only have a few customers and they are now moving on.&nbsp; can anyone help?&nbsp; some kind of free bitcoins for buyers, or a contest from Vendors or something? . . <br /><br />&nbsp;Can DPR provide some method for us vendors to keep our buyers here?&nbsp; H E L P.&nbsp; &nbsp; Our very few customers are moving on to other places. . . we need to show our customers that we care about them and their needs and I&#039;m not sure how to express that when they are threatening to go elsewhere.&nbsp; Its a real situation that needs a resolution directly from a leader.<br /><br />Damn landlord won&#039;t take drugs as rent payment.&nbsp; But I&#039;ll stay loyal as long as I can keep easting Kraft dinner.<br />I wish I was wealthy like some other sellers.

				I&#039;m loyal to SR and will always be, but being loyal to SR doesnt mean not selling other place. I personally do not sell anywhere else, but It would be very understandable if another vendor were selling on 2-3 markets.<br /><br />You cannot blame a vendor for selling his product on more then one place... specially when he pay vendor fees on all the site he sell on.

Awesome man. If the infrastructure, core staff, vendors/buyers stay loyal to this place.. the DDoS end game will fall apart and they will give up. <br />Trust me on this. They want people to migrate out of here. This is about money, nothing else (says my gut).<br /><br />Imagine if Scout actually defected over to Atlantis!! Only to really be a double agent, get the scoop on who&#039;s hitting us (not pointing fingers..) and sabotage them.<br />I think we need some spies doing field work during this time. Who knows, maybe we already do?

				I am sick of hearing people saying &quot;this is a free market, I will take my business elsewhere&quot;. You know what? TAKE IT ELSEWHERE.<br />I think I speak for alot of my fellow vendors when I say WE have more to lose then anybody. We have tens of thousands of dollars tied up in Silk Road, yet you hear us crying about it? Nope. But you get the occasional buyer saying he&#039;s gonna take his $100 dollar to another marketplace. lol!! Take your $100 dollars and run along now. Nobody stands to lose more then vendors, and take notice how most of us are holding it down right here where we got started.<br />Jesus christ people have some patience in life.

				This placed has seriously changed my life. It is unbelievable how amazing Silkroad is and I will ALWAYS be loyal to it. I have thought about adding listings to another site that i would ONLY use when Silkroad is down but I won&#039;t be doing that..... I have 100% confidence in this site, I would not feel safe AT ALL having money tied up on any other hidden service if something like this happened I would assume all my money lost. DPR has ALWAYS fixed ANY issues that this site has been hit with and I am confident the fight will be won and soon we will be back to business as usual :) The site has been down for longer than this before and DPR and the team have time and time again impressed the fuck out of everyone with what they are capable of. It is very depressing knowing that this is my third day without any sales as the site has been down, so that really is a lot of profit being lost but if it wasn&#039;t for the road I wouldn&#039;t be making anything at all so I can&#039;t bitch about it going down for a few days.....<br /><br />I am way to old and over/ worn out of the life of selling drugs IRL on the street, so this place has forever changed my life for the better and I will NEVER leave it as long as it is open, which I hope will be forever :)

				Hello, <br /><br />Though we at T5 are waiting and not moving away, you have to understand that for most top vendors this is a full-time job, and that there are a lot of employees working for these accounts. Top sellers are not one man shows. <br /><br />Most of the people who moved away did it temporarily. TBMR and Atlantis are pale copies of SilkRoad, any true Silkroader knows the SR is best, and once it&#039;s back online everyone will just come back and leave the other websites behind. <br /><br />Put yourself in the full-time vendors&#039; shoes. Some of us make placements, invest our money elsewhere and etc, but there are other vendors who like to spend a little more and have less money secured. These are the people who might be tempted to temporarily move away so they still get their &quot;salary&quot;.<br /><br />I think a list of &quot;disloyal&quot; vendors is completely useless.

				Loyalty? The only loyalty we need vendors to have is to making $ and not scamming. And then there&#039;s me following them around... :P. I rather it always be under the flag of DPR, and in a way it will, no matter what happens. Like a patron saint sorta deal.<br /><br />Most of the vendors who couldn&#039;t take the stress of BTC volatility and SR instability and scamming customers and high volume stealth shipping have already packed up and left long ago. Back to street dealing, some at BMR, some being closely monitored at Atlantis (j/k?), others going straight, and some might have made enough to retire to Belize.<br /><br />The vendors that have stuck it out this long think of multi-day DDoS attacks more like mini vacations, especially with all that spare product laying around. Now the vendors that are really scrapping by and obsessing about FEing, they just aren&#039;t tier 1 SR vendors yet... they need to Amazon up their game up.
