				Alleged mastermind behind &#039;Silk Road&#039; drug website to be sent to New York to face charges-- A federal judge on Wednesday (today 9th)&nbsp; ordered a California man charged with operating a notorious online drug marketplace known as Silk Road to be sent to New York to face charges.<br /><br />Ross William Ulbricht, 29, agreed to remain in custody, waiving his right to argue for release on bail.<br /><br />His public defender Brandon LeBlanc said Ulbricht will be transferred immediately from his jail cell in downtown Oakland and might argue for release once he reaches New York, where he is charged with three felonies related to the website, including solicitation of murder.<br />Silk Road gained widespread notoriety two years ago as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash. A so-called hidden site, Silk Road used an online tool known as Tor to mask the location of its servers.<br /><br />While many other sites sell drugs more or less openly, Silk Road&#039;s technical sophistication, its user-friendly escrow system and its promise of near-total anonymity quickly made it among the best known.<br />The FBI shut down the site when they arrested Ulbricht on Oct. 1 at a small branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a co-operating witness, according to authorities and court papers.<br />He is also charged in Baltimore federal court with soliciting the murder of a former worker who was arrested on drug charges. The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the former worker would turn on him.<br />The FBI said Ulbricht unwittingly hired an undercover agent for the murder, which the FBI staged but never took place.<br />Prosecutors in New York have charged Ulbricht with trying unsuccessfully to solicit the murder of a Canadian man who allegedly hacked into Silk Road, obtained dealers names and began blackmailing Ulbricht.<br /><br />Ulbricht is accused of operating Silk Road under the alias &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; and earning $80 million from commissions involving every sale.<br />LeBlanc has denied the charges against Ulbricht and said outside court on Wednesday that Ulbricht will be represented by another lawyer in New York. LeBlanc declined to say if the attorney will be privately retained or a public defender.<br /><br />Inside, LeBlanc told U.S. Magistrate Court Judge Joseph Spero, &quot;we ... disavow all aliases&quot; alleged in the government&#039;s charge.<br />&quot;All we admitted to is that he is Ross Ulbricht,&quot; LeBlanc said outside court. &quot;That was the only admission.&quot;<br />Federal defendants must be formally identified before authorities can transfer them.<br /><br />Ulbricht appeared in court shackled at the ankles and wearing Alameda County jail garb. He said &quot;good morning&quot; to the judge and peered into the packed gallery during the five-minute hearing.<br />FBI agents appear to have penetrated the behind-the-scenes operations of Silk Road and obtained a list of the sites users and sellers, court papers show.<br />Authorities in Britain, Sweden, and the United States have arrested eight people who are charged with using the site to sell drugs. In Washington state, a man and a woman were arrested on charges of selling cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine through the now-shuttered website.<br /><br />In the U.K., the country&#039;s newly established National Crime Agency indicated more arrests were on the way.<br />&quot;These latest arrests are just the start; there are many more to come,&quot; said Keith Bristow, head of the agency.<br />In court papers, the FBI said it had managed to copy the contents of the site&#039;s server -- something one expert said would likely provide international authorities with detailed information about dealers who use the website.<br /><br />&quot;Any large sellers on Silk Road should be very nervous,&quot; said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley and the University of California, San Diego.<br />The traceable nature of bitcoin transfers means the FBI &quot;can now easily follow the money,&quot; Weaver said in an email.

They&#039;re aren&#039;t additional charges awaiting him NY; he was indicted in the Southern District of NY (and also the US District Court of Maryland). The reason he was being held in CA and the initial hearings were in CA is because that&#039;s where he was arrested. He wasn&#039;t facing any charges (at least by the US government) in CA.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=219631.msg1596984#msg1596984">Quote from: NorthernStar on October 09, 2013, 10:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The FBI said Ulbricht unwittingly hired an undercover agent for the murder, which the FBI staged but never took place.<br />Prosecutors in New York have charged Ulbricht with trying unsuccessfully to solicit the murder of a Canadian man who allegedly hacked into Silk Road, obtained dealers names and began blackmailing Ulbricht.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Unless they&#039;ve unsealed an additional indictment, this article is not correct. MOST publications are NOT reporting that.<br /><br />He&#039;s charged with narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and hacking (conspiracy on all counts) in NY, but not murder.<br /><br />These are seperate incidents. He&#039;s only been charged with attempted murder (aka conspiracy to commit murder) of an ex-SR-employee in Maryland.<br /><br />The person who was allegedly the target of the hit in the NY complaint doesn&#039;t exist according to Canadian authorities. I&#039;m assuming that he wasn&#039;t charged because they don&#039;t have a witness (I can&#039;t see why else they wouldn&#039;t charge him).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: NorthernStar</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Inside, LeBlanc told U.S. Magistrate Court Judge Joseph Spero, &quot;we ... disavow all aliases&quot; alleged in the government&#039;s charge.<br />&quot;All we admitted to is that he is Ross Ulbricht,&quot; LeBlanc said outside court. &quot;That was the only admission.&quot;<br />Federal defendants must be formally identified before authorities can transfer them.<br /><br />Interesting, thoughts any-one??</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>To me, this isn&#039;t even remotely interesting; it&#039;s pretty mundane. This is meaningless. Of course he denied all aliases. He had to state is real name before being transported to NY due to federal rules of criminal procedure. That&#039;s it. If he hasn&#039;t declared his name, he&#039;d be sitting in a CA Federal Detention Center until he did. Since he&#039;s already pleaded not guilty, he&#039;s obviously going to deny the aliases. I wouldn&#039;t read any more into that other than what&#039;s on the surface.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: imyourepusher</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It scares the shit out of me it really does.<br />But where are all the arrests?????<br />What was there?? 8 total?

If your name is referencing the fact that you&#039;re a dealer (like, instead of referencing Curtis Mayfield), then depending on the size of your business, maybe you should worry. I&#039;m not worried at all.<br /><br />Also not sure if it was 8 or 10 arrests, but either way, that&#039;s in 3 countries combined (US, UK, and Sweden). That&#039;s not really a lot given the sheer number of SR vendors, not to mention buyers. <br /><br />As for mind games, they&#039;re not very good at them if that&#039;s what they&#039;re doing <br /><br />

I&#039;ve really just been coming back to this site to read replies to my other posts. Every once in a while, I see a new topic that I know something about and I post. There&#039;s still a fair amount of people here and an assload of misinformation, which drives me nuts. In other words, I get sucked in LOL.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to head over there eventually, just haven&#039;t gotten there yet ;)
