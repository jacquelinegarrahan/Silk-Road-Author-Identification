				Regardless of the reasoning for the percentiles, I think it&#039;s nice because different vendors have different wares so they may not be the top vendor on the site but the best in their category.&nbsp; With percentiles this becomes less of an issue because the top vendors in a cateogry will probably be high over all.<br /><br />I also think that either the newest reviews of transactions should be displayed, or a time reference for random selection.<br /><br />On another note, loving the domestic only option!

				These really are not small changes at all. Access to extensive feedback for given items and vendors is the single largest factor I have in determining risk assessment. If I can determine neither the age, volume or geographic particulars of feedback (Have people brought it into Australia? what timelines are they seeing? what loss rates? etc) I am in no real position to make educated decisions with regard to my own safety. Messaging particular vendors is both time consuming and less reliable than user feedback, since it is in the vendors&#039; interest to say &#039;yeah I have nearly 100% success rate to Aus&#039;, or alternatively if market conditions encourage, possibly to use an overinflated risk model to lower refund rates or outright selective scam as some users have postulated. <br /><br />I also agree with Paperchasing that this will not significantly mask the overall size or patterns of SR operations to any competent and longstanding LE surveillance and profiling operations.

				The changes in general are positive, except for the feedback! I am of the opinion that these changes to feedback dramatically reduce the buyers ability to accurately determine the vendors reliability. <br /><br />I agree that the recent transactions are more relative to the reputation and the time stamp is extremely important. A prime example is LTTM who quit selling a few months ago, and has had no reliable feedback since returning to sell. Now the vendor page just shows all positive feedback and it completely masks the fact NONE of those feedbacks are actually from recent transactions! The feedback system is practically worthless now and I personally do not support the changes. Recently SR has completely focused on protecting the vendor but SR need not forget without the buyers, this community certainly would not be here either. Something needs to be done about this to protect us as well.

				I like the idea of protecting the vendors.&nbsp; No one wants anyone here to get busted.&nbsp; In that sense, some of these changes are for the better.&nbsp; The percentage thing is fine, and I don&#039;t necessarily need to see ALL of the feedback (hasn&#039;t it been capped at the last few months anyway?).<br /><br />However, I do want to see the most RECENT feedback, preferably in chronological order.&nbsp; As others have detailed above, it is of the utmost importance that we know when feedback was given so as to judge the most recent dealings of the vendor and the quality of their product.&nbsp; I honestly can&#039;t see how removing the time stamp protects a vendor.&nbsp; If it must be randomized and not have a time stamp, then perhaps the feedback could be selected only from the last ~10 days?&nbsp; Without knowing when it happened, feedback is almost worthless.

				i think that if you keep the last 3 pages of buyer feedback then it will be a representative enough for a buyer to go from. maybe less but you have to keep newest transactions available. appa, i think the 10 days is a bit much for really high volume vendors if the idea is to keep business #&#039;s secret.

				Well, I dont know how you would go about that however more importantly what does it matter how big a vendor is really because if your here and you somehow have your ass exposed by revealing critical personal information your very likely gonna get busted whether your #1 or #100 in terms of ranking...&nbsp; Its up to the vendors to not reveal anything stupid about themselves, you cannot protect them from self incriminating stupidity.&nbsp; Now, recognize that if your a vendor then you know the risk your taking...&nbsp; now you can pass on getting paid here or get muscled up and handle it.&nbsp; Hiding user feedback is not going to save the vendors...&nbsp; effectively hiding their true identity will.&nbsp; Simple.<br /><br />Humm...&nbsp; SR has had fairly consistent growth, the only &quot;special&quot; growth periods have been during media exposure and that has a degree of predictability to it.&nbsp; Media exposure can be factored into growth.. its no matter either way as the scope of this operation rivals most DTO&#039;s worldwide and you can bet the DEA already is aware of this so the idea that hiding the size and scope of Silk Road is really quite laughable at this point.&nbsp; And what about the forums here?&nbsp; Like people cant figure out who&#039;s who by clicking around here for a bit... like it or not this decision was made a long time ago when &quot;the die has been cast&quot; so that horse has already left the barn.&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t take a rocket scientist or a slide rule to figure out who the biggest pill or coke dealers here are, really.&nbsp; And further to contemplate that the feds have not already made purchases from all the top vendors is beyond ludicrous... so they have us all in their purchasing history anyways.<br /><br />With regard to the accounting page only going back 3 pages all along:&nbsp; It has not been that way for me at all till now.&nbsp; Perhaps you may recall us having discussions on the forums here about vendors should have a way to delete the accounting logs once we are satisfied with it for security purposes&nbsp; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1667.0)&nbsp; The reason we had this discussion was because the accounting log ran all the way back and vendors had no way to delete it if we so chose to do so.&nbsp; It needs to be returned to full access and the individual vendors should choose when to delete their logs. <br /><br />Once again I find myself having to ask:&nbsp; Why in the world was these changes not discussed in open format prior to implementation with the higher ranked vendors and/or buyers after such unpleasantness with when the commission change went into effect?&nbsp; Really and truly an open dialogue would do wonders for progress and make changes silky smooth.

				PROPOSAL: new vendor section of the forum (differing from Rumor Mill). Read on to see how. <br /><br />What we&#039;ll need then is a vendor section of the forum. A section with its own heading where each vendor will have their own thread created by the Vendor (in alphabetical order, preferably but not sure the forum software can keep it this way. I believe new posts bump the thread to the top). Buyers can NOT create threads in this section but can only post to existing vendor threads. (Which would mean that a new class of poster called Vendor or Seller would have to be made which grants thread starting privilege in this section.<br /><br />Every vendor&#039;s profile page and perhaps even product page on Silk Road market should encourage buyers to review/discuss the product in the vendor&#039;s thread with a link to it. <br /><br />The purpose of this section is to facilitate seller announcements in the opening post, for sellers to address concerns, for buyer to ask questions, for buyers to discuss current product quality and general discourse and advice about product use.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Vendor get&#039;s the first post of the thread where they can describe their business and offerings, policies, announcements, URL link to seller page on SR, or whatever else they want to discuss or reveal. The vendor must title their thread with their vendor name. But they can add after their vendor name, what they sell. <br /><br />For instance, let&#039;s take Pharmville as an example. They can name their thread:<br /><br />Pharmville - [Opiates, Benzos, Fast shipping - professional service &quot;the drugs you want at the prices you&#039;ll love] <br /><br />Also, this could be the one place a seller can list their seller page URL instead of in their signature. When they want to go into stealth mode, they can remove their seller page URL from the opening post. They can even announce that they&#039;re about to or have gone stealth and when they anticipate de-activating stealth. Having the seller page URL here would reduce the likelihood of causally defeating stealth mode.&nbsp; <br /><br />Doing this would serve the purpose of allowing buyers to gauge the present state of the vendor - quality of product, shipping times, current issues. It would also serve as a meeting place for buyers who share a vendor in common. <br /><br />Lastly, when a vendor&#039;s thread gets too big, an admin or mod can send the vendor a PM that the thread will be closed and that the Vendor must start a new one with a link to the old thread in the opening post of the new thread. Vendors will also have to update their SR seller&#039;s page to reflect the change. And for those who might have bookmarked the old thread, admins should make the last post of the old thread, link to the new thread. <br /><br /><br />With this vendor only section, instead of mixing in all manner of threads that the rumor mill does, you&#039;ll have a centralized area for vendor specific dialogue. <br /><br />Thanks in advance for your consideration.

				Just wanted to add that I agree that placing a cap on the number of feedbacks makes a lot more sense than doing random feedbacks. If you don&#039;t display the last X number of feedbacks about a vendor or item, the feedback system becomes essentially worthless. This isn&#039;t Amazon, where the product is the same from 2008 to 2012, and so reviews from months/years ago still hold relevance. On Silk Road, any reviews older than a week are worthless compared to the reviews from the last week.<br /><br />Perhaps if you don&#039;t want to display exact age of the review, you could simply say &quot;Within the last 7 days&quot;, &quot;Within the last month&quot;, &quot;More than a month ago&quot;, something like that. Look, trying to disguise vendor volume to this degree is harmful to buyers, since we need sufficient information to enable us to judge those vendors. I agree some amount of obfuscation would be appropriate, but the amount that has been introduced is too much: I can still come up with techniques to determine rough approximates of vendor volume (with decent accuracy), so you really haven&#039;t done much for the vendors there, all you&#039;ve done is make life more difficult for buyers.<br /><br />A more useful modification to the ordering/feedback system would be to introduce a way for users to finalize early but delay issuing feedback until the product arrives. With some vendors, all you see is &quot;Finalizing Early, will update&quot; or blank bars. And if you ordered from one of those vendors, the only way you could really figure out if things were going smoothly was to go back and see if people changed their reviews to indicate that everything went well. It would be immensely more useful if their feedback didn&#039;t enter the system until they received their product (even if the vendor already has their funds).<br /><br />In fact, the whole order process needs another step. This has been brought up over and over. There needs to be a step in between processing and in transit. Allow vendors to respond to &quot;Processing&quot; with &quot;Order Accepted&quot;, &quot;Order Requires Early Finalize&quot;, &quot;Order Declined&quot; (and a spot where you can enter a reason). That way, &quot;In transit&quot; will truly mean that, without introducing the race condition that currently exists, where a vendor can get burned if they pack the product on the 4th day, go to ship it, and have the buyer cancel the order before they can mark &quot;in transit&quot; (I&#039;ve had this happen to me twice, both times I paid the vendors, but maybe others aren&#039;t so honorable). <br /><br />Vendors who require early finalization from a particular user will be able to communicate that (and receive it without getting to the &#039;feedback&#039; stage prematurely), Vendors who want to decline an order can do so and send a reason without having to separately go and send a message, and Users who are often left wondering &quot;my order has been stuck in processing for days...should I contact the vendor and ask what is up?&quot; will no longer have to wonder so much, because they will see &quot;Order Accepted&quot;, and they will happily know the order has been seen and processed (even if it hasn&#039;t left the building yet), which will cut down on the message load for some of the larger vendors.<br /><br />It&#039;s a win-win-win...Vendors win, Customers win, Silk Road wins. Why can&#039;t this be done?

				Agree with OldGuard - a big concern is you won&#039;t necessarily see the hint of trouble when you start seeing all the finalize early messages in the feedback.&nbsp; Other than that, I rely much more on the forum for general feedback on vendors, and sure highly recommend that to others.&nbsp; If you are going to stick with the randomized feedback, maybe it would be appropriate to include a warning message and recommendation to do your due diligence on the forum.

				Exactly, I mean unless you can see the most recent feedback you have no idea if the vendor has all of a sudden turned to shitty service since you may be seeing all feedback from beyond two months ago like I said previously. Also to just do the most recent ten wont work either because you need to be able to scan through and get an average sometimes or if all of them are finalize early. Also, there is already the option of finalizing early, but then you just dont enter anything into the box and you do not click leave feedback... just select the SR link and navigate page to SR home. This does not leave any feedback yet you can still FE! Click on orders once it arrives and THEN leave feedback. <br /><br />Seriously why fuck with the feedback system so much? it wasnt perfect but needs to be completely re-worked now. <br /><br />Just change it over to either POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL as it was already being used...<br /><br />then you just need to show all the past 50 feedbacks MINIMIUM, probably more like 100 at least. other information that NEEDS to be there is the item and how long ago the feedback was left. this is extremely important and I cannot understand what security or other benefit it provides except hurting buyers<br /><br />as I said currently the feedback system is practically worthless. users that do not utilize the forum are so much more likely to be scammed now. Feedback can be completely falsified and theres absolutely no way to tell if they do enough of it cause its all an average now... <br /><br />I agree Paperchasing, ideas like this are great to try and further the community, always progressing, but radical changes to the fundamental structure of the site could be run by the community first which may save some re-working and hassles that werent originally foreseen. These werent just a few small changes!<br /><br />Just my feelings on the situation,<br />- microRiboNucleicAcid

				I&#039;m not real wild about these changes either. I like to see other people&#039;s review of recent products. Quality can shift at any time.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to limit reviews, I wish you include 5 low/mid ratings as well as 5 high. The low ratings mean as much to me, if not more than the high ones especially when I&#039;m considering someone in the low 90s.

				As from a seller view 10 ratings are not enough. Sometimes we have more than 20 feedback overnight and we have no idea about that. Was there one NOT 5/5 in it? Who was it and why? - Thats very important to have the best costumer relation ship - and that means as a seller you should see all your feedback.

				The idea of an official private vendors section has been put out by me from several times in the past but has been met with no response from Mr. SR...&nbsp; of course that&#039;s not to say that the professional vendors have been just standing around wringing their hands wondering what we&#039;re gonna do lol...&nbsp; survivors know that you have to lead, follow or get out of the way.&nbsp; Rome was not built in a day but Nero certainly burned it down in one.<br /><br />You know, you can always count on me to deliver the straight up truth from my perspective, sometimes Im right and sometimes Im wrong... but at least you will always know that I&#039;ll never just pat you on the back while Im thinking &quot;WTF is this dude doing...&quot;&nbsp; see Im the kind of friend that if we were in a bar and for no reason known to me you all of a sudden you shouted &quot;fuck the Outlaw bikers, bunch of fake ass bitches&quot; I&#039;d fight my way out the door WITH you and THEN ask you &quot;so what the hell was you thinking bro&quot; later.<br /><br />I keep calling you Mr. SR because that name to me invokes the &quot;fuck Senators Beavis and Butthead very much&quot; sentiments I so fondly recall much more so than DPR...&nbsp; sorry but the name DPR just has no history or past value to me...&nbsp; you&#039;ll always be Mr. SR to me bro... no disrespect whatsoever of course, its just a more powerful name that carries with it the magic of the struggle we&#039;ve shared.&nbsp; You know, I have friends that go by two names:&nbsp; one that the straight up OG&#039;s know and one that everyone else knows so that they can easily ascertain who&#039;s addressing them without even looking.&nbsp; I guess what I&#039;m saying is &quot;Mr. SR&quot; is your OG name in my book playa...&nbsp;

				By the way, the DEA considers a DTO (Drug Trafficing Organization) &quot;large&quot; if it has around 1000 members worldwide... so we both know there is well over a 100x that here...&nbsp; and even if you excluded all the non-active accounts and went with the real figures of somewhere around 25,000 regular active members we make up one of the largest and most resilient DTO&#039;s in the world.<br /><br />We waaayyyyyy past the point of hiding...&nbsp; besides hiding is for prey and Im more of a predator myself.<br /><br />And since you have established no private place to discuss this, Im just going to talk to you about something a little different right here that&#039;s been on my mind for a while now:&nbsp; you should have two separate teams of legal counselors by now.&nbsp; How do I know you dont?&nbsp; Easy:&nbsp; You opened a separate website selling guns of all things thereby creating a major change in your status from &quot;a lone website engaged primarily in drug trafficking&quot; to a &quot;continuing criminal enterprise with expanding vistas&quot; better known as a CCE and now your the &#039;Mastermind&#039; (yes, that&#039;s a major sentencing enhancement as well).&nbsp; Your lawyers would have dragged you kicking and screaming if necessary away from that idea... all to give the thin veil of not selling guns on SR?&nbsp; &nbsp;Ummm yeh right everyone really believes you don&#039;t have nothing to do with selling guns.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with selling guns at all but the way you went about it is legally far more treacherous and politically paper-thin.&nbsp; All of which was the result of a knee-jerk reaction to the free-fall outcome of SR&#039;s negative media exposure from the Gawker article and mounting pressure from people whom have nothing at all to lose by pressing you to move the sale of guns off-site so they &quot;feel better about buying drugs.&quot;&nbsp; I sell and buy drugs all the time with guns around, it makes everyone more comfortable actually because everyone knows if someone starts some bullshit it could go really really wrong real fast... so nobody ever does.&nbsp; Mostly everyone I know that moves weight has guns as well for insurance so everyone is already supporting guns by proxy anyways whether they know it or not.&nbsp; Its kinda like Switzerland:&nbsp; Everyone has guns so crime rate is low.. why?&nbsp; Cause everyone knows everyone else defiantly has guns and knows how to use them.<br /><br />So, one team for criminal indictment avoidance (yes, its their job to help guide you and keep you out of trouble or at least minimize your exposure if you hire them *before* you find yourself in trouble) and one that specializes in managing your media relations which I might be so frank as to say has been less than effective so far in terms of garnering favorable reports...&nbsp; hell, a recent one on Forbes.com directly links Silk Road to human trafficking and child p*orn which is something that does not even ever happen here to my knowledge (http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/30/how-technology-complicates-the-war-on-drugs-guns-and-drugs-for-sale-online/2/).&nbsp; One brick thru her window would have gotten that shit edited right out if pursuit of diplomatic solutions did not bear positive results or simply was not possible.&nbsp; Now how in the world did that shit happen?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing your advisers were too busy dreaming up hash algorithms for hiding transaction numbers and such from warweed while the media was boiling Silk Roads members alive, vendors and buyers alike, by painting us all as human traffickers and supporters of child p*rn.&nbsp; The media can make or break you and valuable opportunities have been squandered away to turn the game around on the jackbooted Law Enforcement baboons that insist on continuing the war on drugs.<br /><br />I dont want to even get into the young kids on SR buying inappropriate things...&nbsp; or if anything is even being done about that?&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know whom your advisers are but I highly recommend that you begin to consider engaging in a private two way dialogue with your partners here on the ground doing the work from day to day... and as I have said several times before perhaps some matters such as these should more appropriately be discussed in a private venue setting.<br /><br />Heres the quote from Forbes.com in qn article written specifically about Silk Road:&nbsp; &quot;The internet, and especially dark sites that operate behind the veil of anonymity, give the sex slave trade a huge advantage.&nbsp; Frankly, I find that pretty terrifying. The cyber-libertarian or cyber-anarchist in us might be sympathetic to online marijuana sales. That enthusiasm withers on the vine rather quickly when the sale involves something like child pornography.&quot;

				The feedback changes seem to cause 2 major issues.&nbsp; First, recent reviews are important.&nbsp; Second, a lot of vendor&#039;s recent reviews are just &quot;Finalizing early&quot;.<br /><br />Other than that, not being able to see all the feedback for somebody with less than 100% becomes an issue.&nbsp; If somebody got a 10 4/5s for a shipping delay, I&#039;m not too inclined to care.&nbsp; If somebody got 3 1/5s cause there was rat shit in their coke, then I care.

				Good moves, except for the feedback. Please listen to the bulk of the posts in here that agree. Seeing the most recent feedback, and what product it is for lets everyone know if an otherwise legitimate vendor has gone bad and skipped town. It also alerts us quickly to a subpar product that might be new for the vendor. <br /><br />I know it&#039;s tough because you want to anonymize and hide as much data as you can, but the feedback is the crux of the entire system, just like it is on ebay. Without it, vendors can break bad easier, steal a few $1000 and then start up shop again. <br /><br />You&#039;re doing good work DPR, and you listen to your users, so I hope you&#039;ll reconsider.

				Thanks DPR. Last 20 feedbacks is much better than random feedbacks. If you&#039;re not willing to display the age of the feedback, maybe you could put something in place where no feedback older than a month is ever displayed then, something like that, to address the situation where a recently reactivated vendor can begin selling based on months-old feedback.

				That&#039;s why I&#039;m thinking that in order to mitigate the loss of effective targeted feedback, a Vendor section of the forum be created with a thread for each vendor on SR. It should be made a requirement for every vendor. That&#039;s where the real info would be contained to make buying decisions. It&#039;s not a feedback thread. But an informational thread with buyers posting their experiences, requests, issues, etc. <br /><br />For instance, HybridMike, something happened to him. That news was in the forum many days before it would start to be reflected in the feedback.

				The Feedback system either needs to revert back to what it was, or else DPR needs to take Anarcho47&#039;s idea on board.<br /><br />Feedback isn&#039;t just used by buyers to determine the legitimacy of vendors, its also used to get an idea of the quality of each product that the vendor offers.

				It&#039;s a tough balancing act between protecting vendors, protecting Silk Road, and protecting DPR. All the while providing actionable information for buyers. We can&#039;t revert back to the old feedback system. DPR made it clear why not. So we have to move forward with ideas that address security concerns while also protecting buyers with real time and useful info. <br /><br />I&#039;d like tabbenoit&#039;s additions. We might even want to segregate vendor section by country. And for the undeclared, well, they&#039;d have their section also. What is key though is that only a vendor can start their thread in that section. No one else, especially buyers. So the section would stay clean and free of off topic threads or buyer&#039;s angst threads. <br /><br />I believe having a Vendor section of the forum wouldn&#039;t reveal the volume of transactions so long as basic rules about not discussing quantity, shipping methods, or any other indentifiable information are maintained.

				I think only the most recent 20 feedbacks isn&#039;t enough. There a lot of very trusted vendors that a lot of people finalize early for, so for popular vendors like that, every feedback is going to be &quot;Finalizing early.&quot; I think 50 would be a better number. It wouldn&#039;t help the police figure out that they&#039;ve been making hundreds of transactions, and it will also give us the buyers a good range of recent reviews to look at. Moving feedback to the forums is an interesting idea, but I think that the Rumor Mill already gives us that aspect.

				Before this changes anybody could easy see how much vendor had transactions.<br />On the profile page go to last feedback page and multiply with 10 (there were 10 feedback per page).<br />Of course, that transaction are only counted for buyers who left an feedback.<br /><br />Item should be next to feedback so buyer could estimate for which item particular feedback are.<br />I would like to feedback go back like it was.

				I enjoyed the old feedback system much more than the one you currently use.<br /><br />With the current system I m not able to tell if the vendor has been doing any business lately and the feedback are shown on other items in the vendors stock that may not be relevant for what a customer is looking for.<br /><br />it&#039;s also a problem that a timeframe is not present. I does not need to be specific, but &quot;within one week/month&quot; or whatever would help a lot for the customers to determine the quality of a vendor.

				So let me get this straight...a lot of these measures are taken to obscure vendor transaction volume to avoid profiling...yet the most recent 20 feedbacks are posted? All you have to do is count the number of unique feedbacks per day or week and you have a very accurate picture of transaction volume. If you have few vendors from each segment of percentile ranking having their unique feedbacks counted, inferring total site volume is pretty trivial at that point. Moreover, this profiling tek could easily be automated and fed into a database, it probably already is... Are these changes totally self-defeating or am I missing something?<br /><br />I also want to put my vote in that this feedback scheme suck in general. Any busy vendor&#039;s page is full of god damn FE feedback...<br /><br />&nbsp;***Please at least place a small message on the page that loads after you click &#039;finalize&#039;, let people know that they don&#039;t have to leave feedback right then, and that they can simply navigate away form the page and fill it in later as well as edit it after that.*** <br /><br />I don&#039;t think very many people even know that they can do this!! It would cut back immensely on worthless FE feedbacks.<br /><br />

				Feedback is an important tool buyers use to avoid scammers.<br />If a vendor has a good rating, but has decided to do a scam n&#039; run on their way out, you aren&#039;t going to see chronologically that the last 10 sales failed, didn&#039;t get there or were finalized early.<br /><br />The rest of the changes seem right on though!

				I have a proposal in making this a more safe and secure place. Right now SR has open registration. Anybody can just come to SR and sign up. I think registration should be by invitation only.

Had such a thing been in place before, I would have never been able to enjoy this place. and I certainly do not want to deny another the wonder that this place is. <br /><br />But your idea is not without merit. A referral system can co-exist with an open registration system. Where established buyers can vouch for a new buyer. But for such a system to work, established buyers would need an incentive to vouch for a new buyer. After all, an established buyer is bringing in new business. So, say, for every new good buyer an established buyer brings, they get some free stuff or a voucher for free stuff on their next order. Something along those lines. <br /><br />But even with a referral system, we need a buyer feedback system so vendors can rate buyers.

Moreover, the greatest benefits of running SR the way it&#039;s currently structured may not be realized until much later. Keeping it open will draw in people with the passion and skills to keep this project in motion, which is what we need more than anything else. I never knew anything like this existed until I came here, and it has opened my eyes to the true potential of anonymous commerce; the surface has barely been scratched. SR may or may not survive, and if it doesn&#039;t I&#039;m confident that something even more robust will take its place, but that is contingent on having people that have seen the possibilities and been similarly inspired by what we have going here. There is a power in these technologies that have an unprecedented ability to bolster the personal freedoms The Man never had any business trying to take from us. Keeping SR open to everyone is the best thing we can do to fuel the future of these possibilities.&nbsp;

				From a buyer point of view the feedback changes are no good. You&#039;d be making us rely too much on the forums. It&#039;s very important for us to be able to see how recent orders were made (slightly less so what was ordered). Why not just cap it at some arbitrary number to obscure the volume of business?

				The only vendors that this protects are those who are trying to lie to buyers about their past or are trying to pull a scam. <br /><br />At the very least you should allow vendors to choose between the two schemes.

Read on to see how. <br /><br />What we&#039;ll need then is a vendor section of the forum. A section with its own heading where each vendor will have their own thread created by the Vendor (in alphabetical order, preferably but not sure the forum software can keep it this way. I believe new posts bump the thread to the top). Buyers can NOT create threads in this section but can only post to existing vendor threads. (Which would mean that a new class of poster called Vendor or Seller would have to be made which grants thread starting privilege in this section.<br /><br />Every vendor&#039;s profile page and perhaps even product page on Silk Road market should encourage buyers to review/discuss the product in the vendor&#039;s thread with a link to it. <br /><br />The purpose of this section is to facilitate seller announcements in the opening post, for sellers to address concerns, for buyer to ask questions, for buyers to discuss current product quality and general discourse and advice about product use.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Vendor get&#039;s the first post of the thread where they can describe their business and offerings, policies, announcements, URL link to seller page on SR, or whatever else they want to discuss or reveal. The vendor must title their thread with their vendor name. But they can add after their vendor name, what they sell. <br /><br />For instance, let&#039;s take Pharmville as an example. They can name their thread:<br /><br />Pharmville - [Opiates, Benzos, Fast shipping - professional service &quot;the drugs you want at the prices you&#039;ll love] <br /><br />Also, this could be the one place a seller can list their seller page URL instead of in their signature. When they want to go into stealth mode, they can remove their seller page URL from the opening post. They can even announce that they&#039;re about to or have gone stealth and when they anticipate de-activating stealth. Having the seller page URL here would reduce the likelihood of causally defeating stealth mode.&nbsp; <br /><br />Doing this would serve the purpose of allowing buyers to gauge the present state of the vendor - quality of product, shipping times, current issues. It would also serve as a meeting place for buyers who share a vendor in common. <br /><br />Lastly, when a vendor&#039;s thread gets too big, an admin or mod can send the vendor a PM that the thread will be closed and that the Vendor must start a new one with a link to the old thread in the opening post of the new thread. Vendors will also have to update their SR seller&#039;s page to reflect the change. And for those who might have bookmarked the old thread, admins should make the last post of the old thread, link to the new thread. <br /><br /><br />With this vendor only section, instead of mixing in all manner of threads that the rumor mill does, you&#039;ll have a centralized area for vendor specific dialogue. <br /><br />Thanks in advance for your consideration.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br /><br />I agreed.<br />We need protection as buyers.<br /><br />And yes thanks for the warning on all the changes, I guess we will get pass this.<br />You are doing the buyers a big disservice. <br />Give us something.......

				DPR, thank you so much for listening to the buyer and taking into consideration our necessities as well! I was slightly disappointed with the system for a while and thought we were just going to have to deal with it. I really appreciate your willingness to work everything out and listen to our suggestions. Hopefully we can work out a compromise to protect the vendors yet still enable buyers to have a clear idea of the vendor reliability and product quality. <br /><br />If the feedback system is reworked, I would like to suggest again that a positive negative neutral system is employed, just because this is currently the way feedback ratings are utilized... in general we just need product specific feedback obviously as well<br /><br />For feedback in general, I posted some ideas in other threads, and even with the revert to a more clear feedback system, I still think these ideas should be applied and could make the system even more helpful.<br /><br />My recommendations and clarifications of the system are:<br />1) If you finalize early, after clicking on finalize, DO NOT click &quot;leave feedback&quot; please. Instead, click the SR link at top left to navigate back to the home page will will not leave an unnecessary feedback without a product review... then once your package arrives, click on &quot;orders&quot; and at that point you can enter a product review and leave your feedback.<br /><br />2) Please be aware that you are able to update your feedback if you are not satisfied for some reason or if you did leave &quot;finalized early.&quot; Just go to your acct page, then click on &quot;view feedback&quot; and you may edit each one from there. This may be especially important if someone begins to scam unexpectedly.<br /><br />Thanks again DPR! Grateful for all you do and the community that exists because of you!<br />- microRNA

				I would first like to thank DPR for having listened to us buyers.<br /><br />I believe one of the problems the buyers/vendors have is that so much of the feedback is just not updated.&nbsp; They finalize early, get their product and then never go back and update their feedback.&nbsp; So in reality much of the feedback is really worthless.&nbsp; <br /><br />There should be a way that would prevent the buyer from an additional purchase if his feedback has not been updated in a certain period of time.&nbsp; For instance, if he has finalized early and has not updated it within 30 days, then attempts to make a purchase, the system would tell him that he first must update his feedback. <br /><br />Of course this could be a real programming headache.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really sure how the system is setup.
