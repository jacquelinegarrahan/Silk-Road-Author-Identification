				Sorry for the elementary level question guys, can someone tell me how to cancel an order or refund an order to a customer. I had someone place an order right before the site went down and it is now showing as late. I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. I informed him I would cancel his order and refund his money for now and if he&#039;d like to place a new order that would be fine. I just don&#039;t want my reputation to damaged by having it show that I was late to ship this order, I just wasn&#039;t able to get on the site. As a new vendor trying to establish a good reputation every customer is extremely important as is reputation scores. Can someone tell me how to cancel/refund, and is it going to damage my reputation by having a &quot;late&quot; order. Thanks guys.

				On the orders page, where you click &#039;Confirm&#039; and &#039;Go&#039; to mark an order sent, click where it says &#039;Confirm&#039; and you will see it is actually a drop down menu. The other option is &#039;Cancel&#039;. Just select &#039;Cancel&#039; and hit &#039;go&#039; and you&#039;re sorted.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				No; it doesnt.<br /><br />It shows &quot;late&quot; (use to be 4 days and now DPR has moved it to 7 days)<br /><br />7days from when a buyer places and order until a vendor &quot;MUST&quot; have it out the door. This is also the time frame in which the BUYER can not cancel the order.....<br /><br /><br />If you as a vendor have an order &quot;late&quot;, but your buyer is cool and you mark it &quot;shipped&quot;...and SHIP IT...this DOES NOT DOES NOT DOES NOT count &quot;against&quot; you as a vendor in anyway.<br /><br />Providing your customer still gives you 5/5 feedback.<br /><br />The feedback score of 1/5 - 5/5 is the only thing that affects your vendor ranking.<br /><br />Best of luck!<br />

Why would he cancel his customer&#039;s order only so he can place it back. Why not just confirm it right now since the customer didn&#039;t cancel...?

				I think the OP was concerned that his feedback would reflect the fact that he was late in getting the order on its way to the customer. That is the impression I get anyway ;)
