				While we are on the subject of avatars, can anyone explain why so many people have the same avatar on here?<br /><br />I keep seeing that kurt cobain one, and the weird model guy that dondada uses, and the creepy dude with the mustache.&nbsp; Many others.<br /><br />Are you guys all pulling from the same avatar pool or is it to cause confusion or what?

Probably included with the simple machine software. I&#039;m guessing the images are in the public domain or something.<br /><br />Given the selection, and where we are, it&#039;s not surprising the Kurt Cobain and Freddy Mercury are chosen more frequently.
