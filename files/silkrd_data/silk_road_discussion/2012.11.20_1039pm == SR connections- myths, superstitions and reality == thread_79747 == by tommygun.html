				So many of these things I have read in certain forums and some I have come up with on my own.&nbsp; Which are true, if any, which can&#039;t be proven for sure?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Refreshing your identity - does it help connect faster than just trying to reconnect?&nbsp; Do some IPs actually get blocked from connection more than others.&nbsp; If so which ones?<br /><br />2. Connecting to SR and forums at same time (different tabs).&nbsp; Does this slow down the connection speed or chance of success?<br /><br />3. Does white listing help?<br /><br />4. Outside of security concerns does connecting to SR while having a browser open decrease you chance of successful connection?<br /><br />5. Are there other settings that actually help you connect?&nbsp; Does restarting ever help?<br /><br />6. Using the silk road/home version of the address.<br /><br />I find myself wondering it I am wasting my time refreshing identity or doing something else that is slowing me down/ decreasing my chances of success.&nbsp; Would rather do the right things than just be left wondering... I mean sometimes its &quot;first try&quot; sometimes its the 10th refresh.&nbsp; Other times I have just reloaded using same identity and it went through right away.<br /><br />Any other &quot;superstition&quot; you may have?&nbsp; Can anyone help debunk?<br /><br />

				Honestly, i think it is just a crap shoot .... some days i get to the road on my first try other times i may need to refresh like 10 times... On days that im having trouble logging off tor and logging back on then trying again seems to work alright but then again not always i do think the best page to try to get to is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/home&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;so good luck and keep pressing try again and it will eventually pop up

				Except 1 which I believe helps, the others don&#039;t make a difference. It&#039;s a matter of luck .... and patience.
