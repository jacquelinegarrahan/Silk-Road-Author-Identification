				So I did have ฿1.75 &amp; now I&#039;ve got ฿1.7466815.<br /><br />Where&#039;s my ฿0.0033185 gone? <br />I know that SR has switched from 2 digits to 8 digits but I should still have ฿1.75. All my previous transactions were numbered in 2 digits, I never did any deals for ฿1.0033185 or anything like that. If all the prices of my previous deals were in 2 digits then I shouldn&#039;t be out ฿0.0033185 but should still show ฿1.75.<br /><br />I realise its only $0.35 or so but still its the principle of the thing.

				I really hope you&#039;re not serious with how glaringly obvious this is...<br /><br />It only used to show 2 decimal places, which means anything after that would have rounded up or down (depending on the number).&nbsp; <br /><br />You never had 1.75 BTC, you had 1.7466815.&nbsp; However, when SR only showed 2 decimal places, 1.7466815 was rounded up to 1.75.&nbsp; Now that they show 8 decimal places, the true amount of BTC you have is shown.&nbsp; <br /><br />The previous transactions weren&#039;t done with 2 decimal places, you were only shown 2 decimal places.<br /><br />You&#039;re getting your panties in a bunch over nothing.&nbsp; SR is not ripping you off and you didn&#039;t lose money on previous transactions due to only 2 decimal places being shown.&nbsp; Go order some Xanax and chill 8)

				Sorry for the 67 messages I sent you Inigo, but after I gave you all my btc to become an investor I NEEDED that withdrawal!! ;D Kidding, I might have invested but all my btc was being loaned out at staggering interest by DPR to Russian oil oligarchs. Alright, good night everybody.

I would have written a reply very similar myself. I also noticed this in my account. When coins are up to 150$ a piece, it&#039;s kinda necessary to use 8 digits. Just like with the number pi, when making very precise calculations, you don&#039;t just use 3.14 or ever 3.1459 and call it a day - precision is needed.<br /><br />It&#039;s no wonder they changed the post cap to 50 - I&#039;m glad they did. Apparently some of the folk here aren&#039;t the creme of the crop so to speak. But I still love you all.<br /><br />Peace, love,<br /><br />3,4

You should stick by the figure you&#039;d originally quoted (1.75), wouldn&#039;t even mean a loss as some folk would be a little up, some a little down when measured in 8 digits so sticking by the 2 digit figures would have be the right thing to do in my opinion.<br /><br />I realise that&#039;s never going to happen, I&#039;m just venting.

				how would making people really lose bitcoins be the right thing to do ? It couldnt be done any other way than what it was as its just the way maths work. As long as you havnt lost anything in reality its all good.
