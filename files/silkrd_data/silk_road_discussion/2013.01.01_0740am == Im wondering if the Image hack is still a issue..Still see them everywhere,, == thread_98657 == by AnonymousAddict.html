				Everyday im on SR i report at least 5 of the QuickBuy Image hack scams . I notice the Vendor&#039;s are getting on or have been on, so is it the Vendor not taking the time to change it or is there still a Opening somewhere on the server.. Just a thought.. Anybody else still noticing there seem to be alot of them still up? I due my SR Member duty and report the Image.

				It&#039;s just lazy vendors who haven&#039;t changed their pictures yet.<br /><br />It&#039;s fairly indicative about how much a vendor cares for their clients IMO when they can&#039;t be bothered correcting an issue 2 weeks after it&#039;s been fixed. Given the time of year I guess it&#039;s excusable as most people are away etc.<br /><br />Best advice is to steer clear of any account still showing this problem.<br /><br />One of the best SR vendors, Asylum, had his account hacked and pilfered for his remaining BTC&#039;s and even had someone come on the forum posing as him asking the community for $$$. Fortunately he came on a day after because they forgot to change the password on his forum account and corrected the mistake, but people had already sent over $600 to the address they gave to send them to which he also is paying back to loyal customers. I admit, I nearly paid money too it because he&#039;s such a nice guy plenty of us would be happy to help him any way we can, but knowing his personality and writing style saved me from spending $$$ he would have eventually paid me back anyway with DMT or some shit (not that I would insist since he&#039;s lost so much already).<br /><br />He got his account back but it was an expensive lesson and one we all should learn from. NEVER sign in anywhere but the legitimate SR site, NEVER use any payment system outside the SR checkout, NEVER deal outside SR period (unless it goes down and you have trusted vendor relations).
