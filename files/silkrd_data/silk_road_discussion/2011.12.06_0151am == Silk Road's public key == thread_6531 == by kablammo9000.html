				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m a brand new member of the community -- the world is now a freer place :)<br /><br />But first thing&#039;s first: I noticed that Silk Road (the user, the head honcho) cryptographically signs most or all of his/her posts, which is great. I would love to be able to confirm that messages are truly from him/her. But to do so, I must have a trusted public key! I have looked around (searching forums and wiki for all kinds of variations on &quot;silk road public key&quot;), but have failed to find anything. I admit this could be a personal failing, but I would have expected a sticky forum thread, or an uneditable wiki page, or something prominently displayed on the SR main site, or something like that! What do people here *trust* to be SR&#039;s public key, and how did you acquire it?

				I can&#039;t personally help you, and I mean no offense, but your paragraph sounds like it&#039;s almost copied word for word out of the LE handbook on infiltration. I know you probably didn&#039;t intend this and aren&#039;t actually LE, but I can&#039;t be the only one to find the writing style... off.

				I can&#039;t speak to whether the poster is LE or not, but frankly there is no way for a new user to acquire a copy of the SR public key the validity of which they can be confidant in. A sticky could easily be edited and no wiki post is truly uneditable. There are copies of the public key around, but you really won&#039;t be able to trust it for verification until at the very least you perform some successful transactions with long-time members who vouch for a copy of the key, perhaps signed with their own public kesy used for arranging your transactions. Even then, you cannot be sure, but it&#039;s a start.

				Thanks, calcium. That public key seems to verify the signatures in SR&#039;s forum posts, and of course one can&#039;t fully &quot;trust&quot; anything, but insofar as SR&#039;s forum posts often contain information that it would be difficult to imagine someone who isn&#039;t actually running SR (or otherwise closely associated) knowing, it gives reasonable confidence, for me anyway.<br />

				Not entirely possible for the whole f2f for trust, I&#039;m sure senior members as well as SR staff or trusted vendors would be suitable signers of his key indicating it is signed and trusted.<br /><br />The irony of this whole thread is it&#039;s not like SR&#039;s key is hidden, he&#039;s user 1 so all you have to do is pull up his user profile and there it is. Why you would attempt to conceal this seems a little comical... Given that it&#039;s totally publicized...

				Good point the public key being on SR&#039;s user profile in the main site. I just discovered that myself and was about to mention it. Only trouble is there&#039;s no obvious link to it, so you have to manually edit the URL to view user 1&#039;s profile (unless you have messages to/from SR, in which case you can click their user name).
