				Amnesia the dark descent<br /><br />By far has been the most fucked up experience ever with a video game.&nbsp; &nbsp; The game on its own seems to have some pretty tripped out experiences.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re not a pussy and don&#039;t mind being a little scared, this game is the shit.&nbsp; Turn off the lights, put on your headphones, take your favorite entertainment substance and enjoy. <br /><br />If ANYBODY has any other games to suggest please post. <br /><br />

				S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl with the latest Oblivion Lost modification.<br /><br />Full-Auto machine pistols anyone? soooo many different guns in this mod :) awesome graphics, extremely atmospheric game design, great use of lighting.<br /><br />It&#039;s one of the very few games that has raised my pulse. Genuinely terrifying in some parts. Play it in a dark room for best effect ;)

				Even when sober, Amnesia is a fucking blast to play. I like to play games when rolling occasionally with friends, Borderlands 2 just has so much color, depth, and humor it almost absorbs you into the game. If I&#039;m smoking bud, any sports game will do just because it turns into a contest to see who can actually make a half court shot or do something ridiculous before the other person. Oh and the obvious game, Audiosurf.

				Roller Coaster Tycoon, especially the latest one where you can actually do a PoV as a rider on the coaster is intense when you are fucked up. Just imagine feeling like you are actually in the coaster moving at 50+ miles an hour, flipping in every which direction. This makes me want to build one of those motion simulator rides you see in arcades or hell spend a couple bucks and hop on some local coasters while tripping.

				Minecraft can be pretty intense, depending on what you&#039;re on.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been stopped in my virtual tracks at the beauty of some scenes in Skyrim while on psychs.

				depends on the drug I guess.. but right now I&#039;m really into &quot;chivalry medieval warfare&quot; and &quot;planetside 2&quot;. Things can get pretty intense with those two games on or off drugs

				I personally must vote for Skyrim.&nbsp; Open world plus great scenery and magic.&nbsp; Rollercoaster Tycoon is definitely a fun series though.<br /><br />If only EA hadn&#039;t screwed up the Command &amp; Conquer series...

I have only just started replaying it this month as a few new mods have been released/updated.<br /><br />If you play Vanilla Stalker (running the game without any mods), you will be very disappointed, it&#039;s full of bugs and glitches, and runs like shit.<br /><br />I am going to recommend you to download either of these two game mods, **use only one though**, they are both great. Each will drastically transform the game, upgrading everything, textures, sounds, gameplay, EVERYTHING.<br /><br />First is STALKERSOUP by tecnobacon - originally made by russians over the last 5-7 years (since the game came out), it has finally been translated into english. get it here - http://tecnobacon.com&nbsp; &nbsp;(it is over 5gb download from file host sites - taken me 4 days to download)&nbsp; - warning! this mod is NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT (unless you cheat of course), be prepared to DIE!!! Quicksave is your BFF.<br /><br />Second is L.E.G.E.N.D.A.R.Y. mod by Majorsoft - available here -&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.filehosting.org/file/details/403451/L.E.G.E.N.D.A.R.Y.7z&nbsp; &nbsp; - it&#039;s about 1.5gb, it doesn&#039;t have the scope of stalkersoup though, here is the discussion board for it - http://www.gsc-game.com/main.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;s_game_type=xr&amp;thm_page=1&amp;thm_id=21854&amp;sec_id=17<br /><br /><br />But the best part is, Legendary mod has over TWO HUNDRED real world firearms added into it. STALKERSOUP has about 250. Vanilla stalker has about 50 firearms.<br /><br /><br />Also, with &#039;any&#039; version of this old game, don&#039;t forget to go into the options menu and change the renderer to &quot;Full Dynamic Lighting&quot;, maximize the resolution (i use 1920x1080) and set all the graphics options to their maximum values. The original in-game Anti-aliasing and Anisotropic filtering settings are broken, set them to max anyway, exit the game and use your video cards control panel to force AAx8 and AFx16 and VSync on. With these settings, the game will be much more playable, especially on todays computers.
