				not sure if that&#039;s a good or bad thing. i&#039;m thinking as long as the owners are trustworthy then it could be better if its in a country that&#039;s out of the feds reach.

				the are in &#039;europe&#039;, so it&#039;s probably eastern europe.<br />that&#039;s not out of feds reach, nothing is. even if there&#039;s no MLAT between countries doesn&#039;t mean there isn&#039;t low level cooperation between police agencies, outright bribery by the FBI of foreign hosting services or coercion to get the info they want. a host just running a vpn service wouldn&#039;t oblige but you never know, maybe the FBI offers him $5k to image the drive or install spyware <br /><br />if they are living in a country with no extradition like ukraine, and one day decide to go on vacation with all their sheep market money the FBI will be waiting to kidnap them in turkey or dubai for a black bag ride back to USA prison. Happened many times before. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve learned from the road that some sellers purposely use simple and wrong english to disguise how they normally type out info or the way in which they might talk in text or typing format as a safety precaution. <br /><br />I cud b rong bout dis do!

But yeah, as soon as you step into a NATO country like Turkey or any other country the US has an extradition treaty with, you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />As a side note, I wouldn&#039;t mail order drugs from Russia with your money, let alone my own. Fuck that!
