				Isn&#039;t this product meant to cause harm? I realize there are other uses, but come on, do we really want to be responsible for what can be done with it?

				This could be a legitimate question rather than the smart ass remark you took it to be.<br /><br />Honestly there&#039;s a number of threads about this,&nbsp; DPR has addressed it himself once or twice.&nbsp; TBH I don&#039;t remember the specific answer, but you should be able to find it using the search function.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the search function only looks in the subforum you&#039;re in so if you search at the top of this page it&#039;ll only search under &#039;silk road discussion&#039;, if you search while in &#039;drug safety&#039; it&#039;ll only search there.&nbsp; Click on the Silk Road Forums text at the top left of any page, then search and you&#039;ll search the entire forums.

				Theres many other uses for cyanide , than the one we are all assuming that its for a sole intention to extinguish life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dont like the listing nor agree with it, myself on a personal level but its a free market. <br /><br />And many other ways to harm people without the need for cyanide. also listed these days.<br /><br />

				There has been loads of debate about whether or not it should be offered, by emerald or any one else, but the fact is that it can be used as a precursor for a few synths, from what ive been told.

				The Silk Road is _not_ a free market.<br /><br />There are rules against weapons, there are fees and bonds, vendors can be banned. This market simply has different rules.<br /><br />A truly free market would be a clusterfuck.
