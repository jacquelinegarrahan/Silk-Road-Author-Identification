				For users that have orders pending in escrow at the borderline either in resolution or about to be auto-finalized, will the penalty be awarded to the customer or vendor? I assume the time lost due to connectivity should be awarded back to the customer to make a decision. <br /><br />Vendors I do not assume most of you want funds held any longer then they need to be, and nor do I. Unfortunately some orders and shipments extend past the allotted time and this question pertains more to the users who are actively pursuing a peaceful resolution with reason, not for the users who simply &quot;forget&quot; to log back on and Finalize. After all ultimately the funds will be released to you.<br /><br />My understanding is this might be a touchy subject to vendors because of &quot;scammers&quot;. For those vendors who agree, I don&#039;t know why but I would like it if you shared your thoughts. I suggest being careful as to not give anybody any more information than you&#039;d want to. <br /><br />The SR Devised this escrow system so that each party has a system upon which to operate on, Sellers chose whether it is necessary or not, Buyers choose the same. There shouldn&#039;t be a going back on your word once you have accepted escrow and I fear that this might warrant Vendors to feel cautious about allowing buyers anymore time to Finalize. I do hope I am wrong, the particular seller I have ordered from will remain unnamed but these thoughts of mine come directly from my perception of his attitude on the matter. I would like to see everyone in this situation come to a happy conclusion.<br /><br />I have a large order placed in escrow that needs extra time, this extra time did not yield any package to me. My due date was today, I have not received my package and do not want to release my funds to this vendor, nor should I have to according to the escrow agreement we both entered. It is not my fault the Silk Road has been down and thus unavailable for me to take ANY action. I believe according to Pine one of the Ethos of the site is &quot;trust no one&quot; or something to that effect. I do not trust my vendor until my product is at my door, nor should you?<br /><br />I would like and appreciate a serious reply to this question.&nbsp; <br /><br />My concern is that the load on the SR Staff will cause a toll on how quick they are able to accommodate people in this situation. <br /><br />My hope is that an understanding can lead to a plan that can be put into action.&nbsp; <br /><br />Possible solutions I see are as follows;<br /><br />1) Time SR Offline awarded back into Time Limit<br />2) Dedicate some(1?) staff(I have no idea how big the resources are here) to deal with tickets opened by issue with a Tag or Subject name that can be distributed here or elsewhere on the forum(perhaps an official thread about the matter).<br /><br />I would appreciate input from those who have been in this situation during one of Silk Roads past down times. My question to those knowledgeable enough to answer it is: does the auto-finalization timer continue will the site is off-line? If my funds are released will I have any recourse via the SR Staff?<br /><br />Thanks for reading :)<br /><br /><br />Discuss 8)<br /><br />

				I believe option 1 would be best and easiest for the admins to implement.<br /><br />eg. if SR was down for 48 hours, then extend all orders by 48 hours before coming back online. If it was 72 hours, then 72 hours, etc...<br /><br />Should be a simple SQL query for any of the programmers to write.

				I also am in this same situation and was wondering if the downtime was added on to your resolution.

				don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s likely an obvious problem with a trivial solution as dingowombat says

				I&#039;ve got the exact same problem. Order got auto-finalized while package hasn&#039;t arrived. Was planning to put it into resolve until SR went down.

				As a Vendor, we agree that for the orders that were to auto-finalize within this 24 to 48 hour period, there should be a small extension of a day.&nbsp; However, not all transactions should be extended (i.e. shipments 5 days out from auto-finalize).&nbsp; Mostly, this should only be an issue for international shipments.&nbsp; Domestic should not be reaching 17 days to arrive in 99%&nbsp; of situations.&nbsp; Some consideration should be made for items not marked in transit and considered &quot;late&quot; as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We all know some asshole is going to scam, but we should be confident that it will be handled properly in resolution.&nbsp; <br /><br />Trying to stay calm and ride out the storm.&nbsp; To GlassHouse buyers: we are ready to make things happen quickly when we are back up, so you can continue to expect quick response times.<br /><br />Don&#039;t waste stones by throwing them, just get stoned.

				I really hope there is some kind of measure put in place because I have One order that I am quite sure is a scam and I really just want to resolve and be done with it... Lesson learned...
