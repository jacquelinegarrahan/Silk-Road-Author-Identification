				There&#039;s no way they&#039;re going to give a computer geek life in prison. It&#039;s not like he actually murdered anyone. The max sentence for what he is being charged with is Life but the minimum is like 5 year for each charge.<br />I&#039;d say he&#039;s going to serve them consecutively so looking at probably 7-10years in jail.

				He will serve life whether guilty or not to serve an example, I really don&#039;t think legal fees would serve a purpose.<br /><br />We could start a worldwide petition to release him...

				Yup I was thinking the exact thing. He made lots of money off our sales and the price we paid to join as a vendor. I&#039;m sure he must have a nice stash buried somewheres out in the desert.<br /><br />I&#039;d sooner help out fellow vendors that lost cash however I am now broke myself so I cannot. Can&#039;t even afford the damn BMR fee gotta wait 2 weeks for a transfer to come in.<br />

				He has&nbsp; alot of bitcoins out there somewhere.&nbsp; He will never see freedom again, guaranteed.&nbsp; They will cumulatively add up the drug charges individually and give him one of those ridiculous American prison sentences of 1000&#039;s of years.&nbsp; Would love if he cryptically left clues for people here to get access to some of his BTC if he ever got caught.&nbsp; That would be good for the movie.

				Fuck no. I can&#039;t for the life of me figure out why this guy would do this shit from the US of all places in the world. I was always of the opinion he&#039;d be logging in to an ultrasecure owned server in a cave in Rafplalakistan via tripple-cascade encrypted satellite link, prolly from the beach in Phuket. Certainly the thing had some acid pans sitting on the HDDs so if someone tried to open it the data was destroyed.<br /><br />But nooooooo, we had to use rented servers in a country that would be amenable to honoring US subpoenas. Even better yet, we would rent those servers with fake IDs but be stupid enough to put our own pics on it. That alone is like Platinum Darwin Award. <br /><br />We all thought he was some sort of genius, turns out he was some third-rate hobby coder who didn&#039;t heed any of the advice he so eagerly dispensed to others.
