				Here&#039;s an interesting question, and I&#039;m wondering if anyone has an informed opinion.&nbsp; How much of the BTC economy does Silk Road comprise? It has to be significant, but is SR really the major portion of BTC activity as I&#039;ve seen people on other threads argue? <br /><br />1. Are there other BIG retail applications for bitcoins? I know that there are businesses here and there that take them, but are there any major players?<br /><br />2. What is the total size of the bitcoin economy? How many BTC are traded each day? I know that the total number in circulation is well known, but how many actually change hands in a day?<br /><br />3. What&#039;s the size of the SR market? OK - that&#039;s a question that probably shouldn&#039;t be analyzed too closely, so it&#039;s just a rhetorical question<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing that bothers me when I hear people say that SR is the majority of the bitcoin market - I don&#039;t believe that SR is big enough to bring down Mt. Gox as happened yesterday. The amount of activity that would bring down a major clearnet site like Mt. Gox has to be orders of magnitude greater than could be handled by SR (or Tor, for that matter). That implies that a majority of the activity NOW is speculators and financial wheeling dealing, and SR activity has minor or no impact on the BTC market.&nbsp; Outside of the bubble situation that we are in now, would this be different - in more boring times does SR take a larger role in driving the bitcoin market?<br /><br />There&#039;s a reason to ask this. If the BTC market is (normally) largely SR driven, then I worry a lot about government shutting it down one way or another. If SR is a minor player, and there is a lot of investment and other legitimate component to bitcoin, then I see hope that it can survive.

				ResearchRUs...<br /><br />I found a good site with lot of historical bitcoin market info.<br /><br />http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg180ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv<br /><br />The volume in bitcoins has been running maybe 40-50K coins per day since the start of the year. Since late January, there have been regular spikes (weekly more or less?) to 150K coins per day.&nbsp; For all of last year, the volume (in numbers of bitcoins) was not all that much different - July and August showed very similar volume spikes to what we are seeing this year.<br /><br />The $ volume of the market has gone up 10 fold since the # of bitcoins traded has not changed a lot but the value has gone up.&nbsp; Right now, the market is $20-30MM per day, so SR cannot be an appreciable portion of that.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I think is an interesting observation... last year in July and August, there was the same volume behavoir (in # of coins/day) that we are seeing now. During that time, the price doubled (from $7 to $14). The price then corrected back to $10, volume settled down, and the price began a more slow stable rise. Hmmmm.

				The thing most people don&#039;t understand when they say BTC isn&#039;t a large part of the BTC economy is the fact that (as we saw from the recent insane price rise and drop) the PRICE of bitcoin is driven almost completely by speculation. Crazy, crazy speculation. If you count bitcoins getting traded around on exchanges and those just being held as speculation and used for no other purpose as &quot;part of the bitcoin economy&quot;, then sure, but I totally disagree with that. It&#039;s technically &quot;part&quot; of the economy, but it&#039;s a meaningless part, other than bouncing btc price around.<br /><br />Of the ACTUAL real goods/services traded that involve bitcoins, I believe SR is a MAJOR player. Certainly along the lines of 20%, but probably much higher. I don&#039;t have all the numbers, but I&#039;d assume at least $2 million in sales is done a month on here (according to various sources I&#039;ve read). I think it&#039;s quite a bit higher personally, but that&#039;s just speculation.<br /><br />What other services are there that don&#039;t directly involve the EXCHANGE of bitcoins? This rules out money made by fastcash, bitinstant, gox, and all the other exchanges.<br /><br />There are very few. A few sites that offer webhosting/vpns, sites like bitcoinstore (I don&#039;t know how big they are), and sites that sell mining equipment. The mining rigs might be a significant portion, but some of them like BFL may never even see the light of day (scams), and even if they do, that&#039;s just mining equipment... although it could drive btc economy with the increased hash power, I guess.<br /><br />I dunno, but unless I&#039;m missing something the vast majority of REAL exchange using bitcoins is done through silkroad. In terms of trading goods for coin, I think it&#039;s over 50% of the market.<br /><br />EDIT: wanted to add a little more to address the end of your post, which I missed. I think that SR going down completely WOULD have a negative effect on bitcoin temporarily, but more sites would pop up quickly to take its place. There are already a couple competitors out there and at least one is gaining some steam, I believe. It&#039;s place would be filled, that&#039;s how the market works.<br /><br />And I have a feeling that DPR, if he felt so inclined (although there are MANY reasons why I don&#039;t believe he would want to), could probably single-handedly crash the shit out of BTC price. Remember, that SR is making probably in the $200,000/month range in revenue. If that&#039;s 75% profit (I think that&#039;s a very conservative estimate), he could be sitting on a TON of coins in a short amount of time (probably has a ton now). If he felt like mass selling them it would precipitate a huge drop in exchange prices and cause another panic like yesterday. I believe yesterday&#039;s crash began with a big time seller in the 50k btc range.

				You could just as easily have asked what % of the dollar economy does ExxonMobil represent?<br /><br />- Obviously ExxonMobil is a powerful corporation with great influence on oil prices. <br /><br />But the link between ExxonMobil and the dollar at this precise second is indirect. <br /><br />A dollar, or a share price, or any price for that matter, is determined by supply and demand. So that is what needs to be explained. Yes, logically some of the demand for USD must be to do with people placing gas into their automobiles, this is known as &quot;the fundamentals&quot; by market analysts, it is the logical underpinning of the price. However you wouldn&#039;t suggest that ExxonMobil is the main driver of dollar price vs other currencies. There&#039;s too many other variables, even when just looking at demand alone, especially market sentiment i.e. herd instincts, emotion.<br /><br />ExxonMobil is part of the &quot;real economy&quot;. The corporation does useful work. Prices not do reflect the real economy at all in the short term. In long term, over a period of months or years, prices tend to converge on the true value of things like shares, dollars, corporate valuations etc.<br /><br />A famous investor called Benjamin Graham explained this most succinctly by saying:<br /><br />&quot;In the short run the [stock exchange] resembles a voting machine. In the long run, it acts like a weighing machine.&quot;<br /><br />This has always, and continues to, cause an immense amount of confusion to Socialists.<br /><br />General Pine Thoughts. Watch out, WOT incoming!<br /><br />--<br /><br />Current BTC prices do not reflect the actual BTC economy. This is always true at any particular time, since value and price could only be perfectly synchronized in a world where nothing changed. However the average BTC price over several years shall certainly represent the BTC economy. <br /><br />--<br /><br />The majority of movement on BTC exchanges today can be attributed to naive speculators. Bitcoin is a great idea for a medium of exchange but it&#039;s still subject to the basic laws of economics that govern every other currency.<br /><br />--<br /><br />It&#039;s important to know that all currency markets are zero sum games. The only legitimate way to (consistently) make money with the BTC economy is to offer services and products, such as the Silk Road, such as offering OTC exchange services in your locale and so on.<br /><br />In every other situation where you are not adding your labor value to the market in some way, it is a zero sum game. This means for every BTC you snag by speculating, somebody else must have lost a BTC. There is no free lunch here. All speculators eventually get burned unless they walk out of the casino in the event of a successful trade.<br /><br />--<br /><br />It is hilarious that DDOS is using used to manipulate BTC prices, because now that it is known that DDOS is being used to change prices by stamping down demand, that information itself changes the price of BTC. In other words, this ultimately won&#039;t generate profits for the attackers. It only works when it is asymmetric information, when they are DDOSing and nobody realizes they are doing it, believing that the lower demand is caused by a legitimate source and they are the only ones who believe the price should be higher... Since that is not true, DDOS only leads to a reduction in the price as that information is factored into the market such that the manipulators find themselves holding their &quot;cheap bitcoin&quot; which are seeming more expensive by the second since the price is dropping and they can&#039;t dispose of it for a profit. They shall only catch the falling knife. Markets are a form of collective intelligence gathering, you battle them at your peril.<br /><br />Awesome.<br /><br />Truly Bitcoin is the Devil&#039;s method of teaching geeks economics! I think the participants in the BTC economy are on a sharp learning curve which is very healthy. Even if you yourself lose some money, I suggest taking it philosophically as a learning experience, because it&#039;ll prevent you making dumb mistakes with much bigger sums of money later on.<br /><br />It is possible to manipulate small or highly illiquid markets successfully if you have a lot of money and a measure control over communication channels (think the pump and dump or boiler room scams), just not as crudely as this. Using other people&#039;s electricity and computer power to generate bitcoin is smart, albeit immoral. <br /><br />--<br /><br />Perversely, even though SR is not a major component of the price movements and volume right now, if SR were successfully interrupted for a while it would likely cause Bitcoin to plummet to single digit prices. That is because the narrative or story about BTC is in large part about &quot;The Internet Black Market Dollar&quot;. Once a panic starts, starting with a logical reason, it can spread without reason. The smartest movers have a disproportionate affect on the actions of other market participants when their actions become known (witness the Buffet following cult).<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ignoring the bitcoin price level entirely, and focusing on the concept and its virulent spread from experiment to prime time. That is what is really interesting.<br /><br />The best part is that Satoshi Nakamoto and the others are manipulating millions of people&#039;s decision making processes from ten thousand feet. This is the definition of cypherpunk, using a mixture of crowd psychology and manipulation of the network super structure (computer/financial/political) to achieve our objectives. Economic structural changes change people. Physics-&gt;Chemistry-&gt;Biology-&gt;Economics-&gt;Society/Culture-&gt;Politics. When you manipulate one of the lower layers, it affects the layer further up hugely. Code is Law. Each and every bitcoin boom cycle spreads information about BTC further and further afield generating a meme that is incredibly hard to suppress.<br /><br />Satoshi Nakamoto is the John Gault of Cypherpunk, What wasn&#039;t remotely possible in Ayn Rand&#039;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, the idea of the productive members of society moving out of the old economy to start their own economy, is now technically feasible. It was completely preposterous. A libertarian pipedream. Now it is a realistic proposition. It is imminently practical and becoming more so all the time. That this is true is incredible and we are privileged to witness the rise of the Cryptocurrency and the Darknet Markets. I mean this is legitimately a first in world history. I am absolutely certain that cryptocurrency and anonymous communications is the key to hollowing out the State. It won&#039;t suddenly happen though. You&#039;re going to be telling your grandchildren about this. <br /><br />If I am intercepted, I shall become a political prisoner or I shall starve myself to death in a cell. Because this is a War. We are soldiers in a battle against our enemy the State. The State shall, once it has got it into it&#039;s thick skull what we are about, shall act violently. It always has done before now and this time shall be no different. To fight against such an immoral enemy is the highest honor. Live free or die. If you&#039;re not willing to sacrifice everything for those you love, then it&#039;s not worth being alive.<br /><br />At the end of the day, with the encroachment of the State on every form of economic activity, the Cypherpunks are just ahead of the curve. Ultimately the majority of people agree with the ideals of the Cypherpunks, they just don&#039;t know it yet. They are worn by cynicism and apathy. They don&#039;t vote any more because the two parties are for practical purposes identical and everybody knows it. Centerism is political cancer. Nobody has any new ideas except for the Cypherpunks. The Occupy, Zeitgeist, Thrive idealogies are simply rehashes of ideas that already exist. They are all correct in that there is a real problem and perspectives need changing, but they offer no structural change to make that happen beyond propaganda. Cypherpunk is an injection of pure adrenaline to the heart of this system. It is *exactly* what is needed.<br /><br />It&#039;s this or we become slaves anyway. The majority of Western countries are taxed over 50% of GDP, half of all production goes to the State. That trend cannot continue without turning into some boring variant of economic Communism or Fascism and destroying us all. Ironically, without some kind of creative destruction going on, the System can eat itself. Not taking a risk can be the greatest risk of all.<br /><br />There are better things to be patriotic about than arbitrary geographical boundaries.

Economic structural changes change people. Physics-&gt;Chemistry-&gt;Biology-&gt;Economics-&gt;Society/Culture-&gt;Politics. When you manipulate one of the lower layers, it affects the layer further up hugely. Code is Law. Each and every bitcoin boom cycle spreads information about BTC further and further afield generating a meme that is incredibly hard to suppress.<br /><br />Satoshi Nakamoto is the John Gault of Cypherpunk, What wasn&#039;t remotely possible in Ayn Rand&#039;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, the idea of the productive members of society moving out of the old economy to start their own economy, is now technically feasible. It was completely preposterous. A libertarian pipedream. Now it is a realistic proposition. It is imminently practical and becoming more so all the time. That this is true is incredible and we are privileged to witness the rise of the Cryptocurrency and the Darknet Markets. I mean this is legitimately a first in world history. I am absolutely certain that cryptocurrency and anonymous communications is the key to hollowing out the State. It won&#039;t suddenly happen though. You&#039;re going to be telling your grandchildren about this. <br /><br />If I am intercepted, I shall become a political prisoner or I shall starve myself to death in a cell. Because this is a War. We are soldiers in a battle against our enemy the State. The State shall, once it has got it into it&#039;s thick skull what we are about, shall act violently. It always has done before now and this time shall be no different. To fight against such an immoral enemy is the highest honor. Live free or die. If you&#039;re not willing to sacrifice everything for those you love, then it&#039;s not worth being alive.<br /><br />At the end of the day, with the encroachment of the State on every form of economic activity, the Cypherpunks are just ahead of the curve. Ultimately the majority of people agree with the ideals of the Cypherpunks, they just don&#039;t know it yet. They are worn by cynicism and apathy. They don&#039;t vote any more because the two parties are for practical purposes identical and everybody knows it. Centerism is political cancer. Nobody has any new ideas except for the Cypherpunks. The Occupy, Zeitgeist, Thrive idealogies are simply rehashes of ideas that already exist. They are all correct in that there is a real problem and perspectives need changing, but they offer no structural change to make that happen beyond propaganda. Cypherpunk is an injection of pure adrenaline to the heart of this system. It is *exactly* what is needed.<br /><br />It&#039;s this or we become slaves anyway. The majority of Western countries are taxed over 50% of GDP, half of all production goes to the State. That trend cannot continue without turning into some boring variant of economic Communism or Fascism and destroying us all. Ironically, without some kind of creative destruction going on, the System can eat itself. Not taking a risk can be the greatest risk of all.<br /><br />There are better things to be patriotic about than arbitrary geographical boundaries </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great read, Pine.

This may sound like pine is being deliberately obtuse, but I&#039;m really not, that is what it is. It really is that hard to reach &quot;strong conclusions&quot; about the relationship between any two prices in the economy. You can have a great head for valuations, but prices are another matter.<br /><br />The big difference between SR with relation to BTC and Exxon with relation to USD is that SR is relatively speaking a much bigger component of economic value in the economy that trades BTC. But that is beside the point, which is that all currencies have similar properties, even if they are cryptographic and the supply isn&#039;t generated by fiat. Currencies can represent either economic activity or speculative activity. Whenever you hear of a market analyst on CNBC talking about how &quot;conditions in the European Union contributed to a fall in the Euro&quot; or anything of that character, they are full of shit.

The truth is that their answers are often accurate (outside of predictive power) and do indeed reflect some aspect of reality, but that nobody wants to hear the truth because it isn&#039;t useful to you in placing trades or setting government policies.
