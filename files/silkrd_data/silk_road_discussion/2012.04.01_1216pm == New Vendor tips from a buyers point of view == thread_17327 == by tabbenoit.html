				Flame away if you must, this isn&#039;t meant to be a bitch session but a substantive list of tips to help a new vendor:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; State your terms of sale on your seller profile page---stick to it, if you honestly will only ship once a week state that<br />2.&nbsp; Be patient and wary of newbies.....<br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t mark &quot;in transit&quot; until item is dropped in box or packaged and it is imminent that it will be dropped that day<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;this creates maybe the most annoyance to buyers for several reasons<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-fucks up our logistics to get the mail before someone else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-we&#039;re jonesing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-causes anxiety for new buyers &quot;fuck he shipped 8 days ago, it must&#039;ve been intercepted&quot;<br />4. Do your best to monitor quality control, if you know it is inferior to what you normally sell, mark it down and state that<br />5. Try to respond to PM&#039;s , some of us understand you probably get an assload of PM&#039;s, just try that&#039;s all<br />6. Suspend your listings when you are waiting on a re-up, that&#039;s what successful vendors do<br />7. If you have an issue, (dog ate stash, roommate stole it, got resupplied with bunk, etc.) update all your pending orders no longer than a day after you discover this, then pull your listings<br /><br />These are my opinions based on my experiences in the past 7 months, others may have other ideas or tips<br /><br /><br />

				Agree on point 6, all the top notch vendors in the way of customer service have all taken breaks to avoid disappointing potential and repeat customers.

				A great list! 3 is what gets me nervous. Vendors being so eager to get their bitcoin that they mark your order as &quot;in transit&quot; a minute after it was placed. I&#039;ve never had any problems directly stem from this, but I&#039;m just waiting for the day when a vendor marks my order as &quot;in transit&quot; then forgets to ship it.

				Most of that stuff is obvious, except for complaining about jonesing, which is kind of ridiculous. But if any seller didn&#039;t do all of those things, I wouldn&#039;t be a repeat customer anyway. Especially regarding the quality of the product. The product quality should remain consistent, and if something happens that causes the product to be inferior, the seller should not sell it and take a loss.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found that most of that stuff can be prevented by simply contacting the seller often regarding your expectations and the details of the shipment. You can request a tracking number, and ask about the quality and how quickly you will get it before you order it.

You&#039;re totally gonna get busted. If you can&#039;t be there when the package arrives then don&#039;t order anything else.<br /><br />The other fucked up thing is that you have a partner that gives a flying fuck about what you get in the mail, and for some reason you can&#039;t just make something up and say &quot;it&#039;s some computer software,&quot; or any thousands of other innocuous things that it could be.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine anybody opening my fucking mail unless they were stealing it, and if anybody asked what a package was I&#039;d tell them none of their business, or I&#039;d tell them it&#039;s something embarassing (like it&#039;s a butt plug, dildo, penis pump, etc.) so they would never ask me something like that again. But fuck living with someone if I have to hide shit from them. Life&#039;s too short for that bullshit. This is my house, bitches! <br /><br />But seriously, why can&#039;t some of you just be home when the package arrives? If it&#039;s something that important (or illegal) that you ordered, or if you spent enough money on it to worry about it, then look up the tracking number for when it&#039;s out for delivery and be home when it gets there. Insist on tracking numbers from your sellers. It&#039;s really not that hard.<br /><br />Now that I have had a chance to think, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s your &quot;spouse,&quot; rather, it sounds like you are trying to hide shit from your mom and dad. That&#039;s the only people that I know of that would have ever opened up a package of mine or been nosy and insistent on knowing what was in it. Plus, nobody would openly admit to being such a pussy and that they are so whipped by their spouse.

My life isn&#039;t structured around SR shipments. I&#039;ve got work. I&#039;ve got a bit of a life outside of the internet. I don&#039;t have time to sit next to my mailbox. While I don&#039;t have to worry about snooping (I just tell my roommates I&#039;m expecting a package and they just bring it in when it arrives), I can see how some people would. And if I were one of those people, not knowing when the package would really arrive could lead to the package just chilling in the mailbox which would really add a great amount of discomfort to the Silk Road experience.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I knew someone would get it....<br /><br />Everyone is dithering though, &quot;In Transit&quot; should mean imminently shipping (unless you state clearly on your profile it doesn&#039;t The Store is a fine example and that&#039;s cool, you know rules before you start).&nbsp; Let&#039;s face we&#039;re all ordering drugs from the internet, we all have problems...&nbsp; I&#039;m not hiding my use, just my source, my spouse won&#039;t even pay bills online so I&#039;m not going there

Do your best to monitor quality control, if you know it is inferior to what you normally sell, mark it down and state that<br />5. Try to respond to PM&#039;s , some of us understand you probably get an assload of PM&#039;s, just try that&#039;s all<br />6. Suspend your listings when you are waiting on a re-up, that&#039;s what successful vendors do<br />7. If you have an issue, (dog ate stash, roommate stole it, got resupplied with bunk, etc.) update all your pending orders no longer than a day after you discover this, then pull your listings<br /><br />These are my opinions based on my experiences in the past 7 months, others may have other ideas or tips<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for taking the time to write this post.

				Shit, my hubby was the one encouraging me to give this site a try.&nbsp; He&#039;d buy drugs on the street for me if I asked him to, and that&#039;s saying somethin&#039;, considering the fact that I can barely get him to take Tylenol when he has a headache!&nbsp; And I would never order something as risky as the items from SR without telling him about it beforehand.

				Everything seems on point in the Original Post, except , like everyone else said....the thing about &quot;In Transit&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;If someone else picks up your package, or a spouse or roommate sees something they shouldn&#039;t....perhaps you are in the wrong place. If you are that worried about it, get a P.O. box for crying out loud!&nbsp; Hell, a good percentage of P.O. boxes are for JUST that......people who want what they receive to be private, for whatever reason.

				So I&#039;m in the minority then I guess about expecting &quot;in transit&quot; to roughly mean &quot;in transit&quot; or imminently &quot;in transit&quot;?&nbsp; I appreciate all the marriage advice and all, I had no idea Dr. Phil and Dr. Drew were on SR....
