				So Pine was 1 of the 2 ppl that anonymously donated a btc, well i really appreciate it. <br />The donations help me get my meds each week: benzos for my anxiety disorders and morphine for my chronic back pain.<br /><br />No one wants to buy a skull this weekend so I can get enough btcs to order meds before i go into withdrawals next week?<br />IDk why ppl don&#039;t post reviews about them but i know for a fact everyone of them was more than happy with the product they received. IMO these skulls represent a symbol of a revolution that while some have fallen the road keeps making history. Forbid the road was to fall but at least have something physical to remind you of what we are all apart and the time in history where the people decided their own futures.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath

				Buying the pure powder would probably save you a lot of money if you don&#039;t already do that.<br /><br />Check out the &quot; HUICHOL HUMAN CLAY SKULL&quot; on the internet these are cool, and maybe another skull avenue you can explore.

				ow, I feel kinda bad for you guys now=P&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Im kinda poor and can&#039;t help much but, atleast have my Thanks and know your presence,wisdom and work is greatly apprecciated by many although prolly 99% of everyone doesnt say anything.<br />I would offer to help in any way when possible (boring clicking stuff like deleting spam etc..) altho I may not have all that much time or want commitments, but I guess you&#039;re handpicked for this for different reasons mostly security and there is no such way to help out..<br />I will make sure to remember to send off change to mods like you next time I have some left after my order and encourage others too! If possible I would prefer (several reasons) that you mods got a lil share of the commision or something, a little encouragement to continue working well here, if for nothing else just that you deserve it!<br />My previous change whent to some scammer here on the forum asking for change..:/ Think I have like 1.5coin on SR now actually that Ill send you,think I saw ur name on SR..hopefully the same and the coins wont disappear into the void. Small amount from one,wish I could help more but Im really poor and rarely have much at all really:/ but hopefully others help too and make a worthy dent in ur drug budget eventually!<br /><br />Hope youre doing well, remember the work seems very thankless but its very much apprecciated by everyone as youre contributing to making this a much better and thriving place. Hope youre all well, best wishes &amp; have a nice day!<br />^^ goes for everyone else here too btw whos presence are contributing to this community, Im very excited about all these nice ppl=) unfortunately not much of a contributor myself but,maybe some day. <br />for now, l8rs, thx again and all the best.. <br />

				Hello, I have a suggestion to avoid spam and work of moderators. <br /><br />Don&#039;t allow new users to post more than 3 times under 5 hours, or something like that. I doubt good new members would need more than that.<br /><br />That way you can catch them and ban before they spam all over the place and leave lots of work for you.
