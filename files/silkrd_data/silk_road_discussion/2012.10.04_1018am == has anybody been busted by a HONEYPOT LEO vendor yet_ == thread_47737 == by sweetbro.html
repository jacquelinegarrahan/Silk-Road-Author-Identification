				No cases yet off SR because they don&#039;t care about buyers but rather vendors. They&#039;ll only go after a buyer if they&#039;re of value (bulk buyers).

				yea - i dont think the buyers have much to worry about and i have never heard of it.<br />it is unlikely that LE would be shipping out tons of anything illegal just to get names <br />of low level buyers.

Of course no vendor has been busted by a honey pot vendor... Where the fuck do you come up with this stupid bullshit??? Thanks for sharing with us what your paranoid non vendor ass would do if you were to get arrested.. <br /><br />Please read your post again and then realize how stupid it is. I&#039;ll help you out and break it down for you.....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47737.msg501878#msg501878">Quote from: sweetbro on October 04, 2012, 10:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">has anybody been busted by a honeypot leo vendor yet?<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Once again as you know there have been over 200 threads in the last 6 months alone about possible/alleged SR bust.. Not one turned out to be a true report...yet 100&#039;s posted on the threads as if it was a fact and all true. Many were &quot;hero&quot; members and of course all were paranoid and feeding off each other. Yet when the thread ran it&#039;s course and the facts came out how much once again it was total bullshit..the thread quietly went away and all the posters went into hiding for a few days and waited for yet another false report to start all over again. So just so you know the facts...NO Silk Road vendor has been busted because of Silk Road. EVER! In over 1.5 years.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47737.msg501878#msg501878">Quote from: sweetbro on October 04, 2012, 10:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />also, has there be a firm verifiable case that a vendor was exposed as a honeypot vendor?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OF COURSE.....NO.

And no one cares what you would do or not do. Also noted how you are trying to put this idea into peoples heads...like a subliminal message..as if there is actually a vendor out there that actually got in trouble but has not come forward and you are letting them know it would be the right thing to do... Thanks<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47737.msg501878#msg501878">Quote from: sweetbro on October 04, 2012, 10:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i havent seen any posts personally in which people have done this. you would think it would be common. it takes me a while to trust new vendors.. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You haven&#039;t seen any post because no vendor has been busted!!!! FACT!&nbsp; You would think it would be common????? What the fuck are you on?? At first I thought it was just weed(I just say that because most of the paranoid post are made by posters who admit they are high as shit on weed...not because I think there is any problem with smoking weed :)..now I think it is something more(no problem at all!!&nbsp; :) just curious what drug makes you this paranoid) Also how would it be common for vendors on Silk Road to be busted?? If it was common there would be no silk road...dummy. You saying that it takes you a while to trust new vendors is about the only thing you have said that I have no problem with. I think every person on here is skeptical of a new vendor. Though if they stay in escrow there is little to no risk at all. But still it is hard to be one of the new vendors first customer. And it is even harder being a new vendor! You have to answer 1000 questions over and over again. Even if you answer them all in your vendor profile...people still feel they have to ask.. just so they feel more comfortable...then when they finally do place an order they will start messaging you within 3 hours wanting a DCN(even though you state that you won&#039;t give them out) and they will go into the rumor mill and make a stupid post about if anyone has dealt with you and how they are nervous because it has been 27 hours and they have not got there package yet(even though you told them it is 2-5 days)...or it has been 8 minutes and they have not got a return message..( only to find out had they refreshed their own page ...the vendor responded 5 min ago). Then you will have more idiots that have not done business with you yet will accuse you of being LEO. Then 10 more will comment how they know you are an old vendor ...do to how you made a sentence. Then 2 days will past and the OP will get his package and everything will be perfect and he will leave you feedback how he got it in less then 3 days from the other side of the country...yet he will give you advice on how to package your shipments..even though he has never shipped any&nbsp; drugs in his life. Then he will tell you how you should print your address labels because hand written labels stand out in the 6 billion packages a year that USPS deals with.... Oh and as for the bullshit thread he made about you??? Don&#039;t worry...he won&#039;t go back in there and admit how wrong he was..instead he won&#039;t make another post..and if you call him out he won&#039;t respond and if he does he will hide behind the &quot;better safe then sorry&quot; excuse... You can&#039;t be to cautious.. Oh and he ordered 1 Xanax to try you out since you are a new vendor before he makes his bulk(16 pills) order. Also he needed to make sure it is &quot;real&quot;... I could go on for about 9 more paragraphs...but I don&#039;t want to get off topic ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47737.msg501878#msg501878">Quote from: sweetbro on October 04, 2012, 10:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />to save space running into several pages it might be better to only respond to this post if you know of a case and you can elaborate.. dont bother posting just to say you dont know of anybody.. therefore we will get a smaller compact thread that people dont have to wade through to find out info.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow...another great paragraph by you. I don&#039;t even need to comment ...as by now we have realized how you want to put into peoples minds how they should or should not respond.But I will ;D. Of course the problem with your silly request is.... there is no fucking person to respond to this(but me) as NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN BUSTED! FACT!!! I like how you try and point out how you know this is a stupid post that will get a lot of response from the &quot;crazy&#039;s&quot; on here that love to post on these &quot;So and so is LEO&quot; and &quot;So and so got busted&quot; total bullshit threads. This tells me that you&nbsp; have read these silly post before and you know just how many people will come in here and post total bullshit. What you should have said is this----- &quot; I know this post is about the stupidest thing I can post besides &quot;I am selling BTC for $3 a coin and taking Paypal&quot; or&quot; PGP is a must!&quot; but I am high as shit and paranoid as fuck and I needed to make a post ... So I chose this stupid topic because it has been at least one week since someone made a post about a vendor getting busted..and the last &quot;Vendor getting busted&quot; thread was not about an American!!!!..So I thought I would start this... I&nbsp; also threw in the word &quot;Honeypot&quot; to mix it up a bit and add something that could totally happen(not)! In fact ...I am sure it has happened and they just did not come forward.. so please.... the usual suspects..do not post in here.. Thanks&quot;<br /><br />That would have been a better OP.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47737.msg501878#msg501878">Quote from: sweetbro on October 04, 2012, 10:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">also if you have less than 10 posts it would be better if you did not respond to this thread. no throwaway accounts for this one please<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is one of my favorite paragraphs by you.. Talk about calling the kettle black! I love how you used the number 10...Yea ..if they have over 10 they are totally legit and valued members of the community! And for this thread...of course no throw away accounts!!! (like yours) I mean.... this is WAY to good an OP to have some &quot;throw away&quot; account respond! It needs valued members like yourself who have been on here an contributed to this forum.. Your other 12 posy were really, really good by the way :D<br /><br /><br />So there you go... Why did you make a new account for this post? I already answered that...but still would like to hear your great reason(s). Also why use the term HONEYPOT??? Do you actually believe LE would become a vendor to bust buyers??? Or as your title says ... to bust vendors? Do you actually believe honeypots exist? Or did you just throw that on there?<br /><br />I am not someone that believes&nbsp; a vendor will never get busted. I just do not think it will be because of Silk Road. There i s a 1000000x more likely a chance that a vendor gets popped IRL.actually is has to happen one day I think just based on the number of vendors on here. I hope it never does.<br /><br />There are so many problems with LE setting up buyer or vendor accounts to bust people on here. It is a legit topic and would take a post 20 times loner then this dumb one(mine...not yours) to explain to people why it would not be worth their time and/or it would be very hard to get evidence to get an actual conviction. I know they would like to. I am sure they are trying. But SR has a great system in place. The BTC is pretty fucking sweet. If everyone follows the SR rules and takes normal common sense precautions... it would be pretty tough to get busted being a vendor on here. And I think it would be almost impossible to get busted being a buyer.<br /><br />Still being cautious is smart. Being paranoid is your choice. Some people can not help themselves. Others are paranoid because of the drugs they take. Some will&nbsp; tell you&quot; it is good to be a little paranoid&quot;.(it&#039;s not) but I can agree with all that. Whatever. <br /><br />What is really wrong with all these types of post is that there are a lot of total idiots in here. ( there have been people that have actually gone to mtgix.com to buy BTC at $6 a coin and didnt realize they were getting fucked!)<br /><br />They will read these bullshit post and actually believe it as facts. Then they will in turn not use SR. I know this because as a vendor I get at least 10 questions a month from &quot;buyers&quot; that will ask me if I am ok because they &quot;herd&quot; (read) that vendors are getting busted! I of course tell them they read wrong and explain how it just didn&#039;t happen and I am just fine. They will go on to tell me they, after &quot;hearing&quot; that news decided not to make any purchases and lay low!! I can&#039;t believe that is true... but it is. <br /><br />This is why I am so against these type of post.(not this one really as I am just against this one because it is so fucking stupid) Not only because they are factually wrong but spreading paranoia... when their all ready is a layer of it &quot;naturally&quot; ...since we are online buying and selling illegal drugs... is just stupid. <br /><br />We should be starting threads about how &quot;no one has ever been in trouble because of Silk Road&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;How great and safe the BTC is. <br /><br />How many great vendors there are on here and how THEY take all the risk<br /><br />&nbsp;How awesome a job DPR and friends have done with the security of this site. <br /><br />Just more positive post about the good things. Not these bullshit, paranoid, nonsense that NEVER proves to be true. EVER!<br /><br />So I guess it is time for another post about how important pgp is!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If you read this far...sorry I wrote this. I wanted to delete it ...but every time I went too...I read the OP and I could not help myself and I hit the post button.

Ever see Cops when they have the female cops go undercover as hookers and stand on the corner?<br /><br />This is not entrapment. Matter a fact entrapment as a whole is hard to prove and the line of what you or I think entrapment is, is skewed very heavily towards the police.<br /><br />A potential LE vendor having a listing that you buy - then the cops kick in your door is not entrapment. Just because they have the offer looming (like the cop hooker on the corner) doesn&#039;t mean you have to order (stop your car and ask how much for a blowy)<br /><br /><br />NOW if that vendor PMed you and said &quot;Buy my crack and i&#039;ll give you another free! This weekend only&quot;<br /><br />This (with a REALLY good lawyer) could be viewed as entrapment.

Now you have the op being a reporter...<br /><br />I explain it in great detail but since you seem to still not get it I will explain again. I really thought there were no girls on SR ... You just changed my mind.<br /><br />The OP was a paranoid idiot. He just made up a story (much like a few of you have responded too...) and asked if it has ever happened. Then in this made up, never happened story, he told you what he would do if he was a vendor and ever got in trouble. Thats it. he didn&#039;t imply it ever has happened. Though he said he found it hard to believe it has not. He said that he thinks vendors have been busted but he does not know.<br /><br />He is not a reporter. If he was there would be nothing to report on since NOTHING has ever happened. He then made more stupid comments about who he wanted replying and how many post they should have. That&#039;s it!<br /><br />Then one of the crazies responded as if the OP left a totally different post that something happened.<br /><br />Then YOU and Phader made post talking about entrapment..when no one including the OP ever said anything about that.&nbsp; But I guess you guys took the word &quot;honeypot&quot; though it is just a word and again has NEVER HAPPENED and you guys starting debating if it was entrapment!! The craziest part is there is no story to debate on if something was entrapment!<br /><br /><br />Then you left this post realizing that the OP had 13 post and was a looney toon yet you had to throw on more crazy that he might be a reporter!!!!! OMG... And you say you have said everything you need to say on this thread and you will let it run it&#039;s course!!<br /><br />WTF did you say in this thread? All you did was respond to a ghost story about entrapment and you were in disbelief that LE would have an operation like that(no shit!!! THEY WOULD NOT) but where did you get that operation part???It is mentioned no where in this thread<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47737.msg502306#msg502306">Quote from: PrincessHIGH on October 04, 2012, 05:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />I don&#039;t really don&#039;t understand why OP wants us to report on a &#039;firm verifiable case&#039; of a SR consumer getting prosecuted by LEO Honeypot Vendor, he might be a reporter looking for his latest scoop to put SR in a bad light. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The OP made it CRYSTAL CLEAR he did not want you to report shit!!

I am not saying that this document specifically allows LE to sell drugs during an investigation, but I am sure there is some document somewhere that grants this ability to a specific branch of one of the alphabet agencies. the issue would arise with international shipments due to international laws being different (and we all know how much the US cares for, nurtures, and follows other countries laws). point is, even though it has never happened before (or proved to have happened before) doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t happen/hasn&#039;t happened. Have any of you who claim LE can&#039;t sell drugs ever been involved in a large scale bust either directly or indirectly? In my younger days, I was present for deals that took place where an undercover police officer sold a large supply of drugs to my dealer. Only at his trial did we see the officer who sold those drugs in uniform. I was in the room for some of those deals, and had knowledge of many others. These deals went on for quite some time because the investigation was not only geared toward my dealer, but toward his other suppliers. Granted this happened 20 years ago, and things might have changed, but I doubt it. <br /><br /><br />And to the &quot;well it hasn&#039;t happened yet, so it never will&quot; crowd. Remember that TFM wasn&#039;t busted until they were!....yeah yeah yeah, SR payment is more secure, they didn&#039;t always use Tor, they didn&#039;t embrace encryption...and NO vendors here use privnote or accept WU for BTC or allow unencrypted addresses, right? And ALL vendors here use OPsec like not shipping from their hometown (ene) and never receive bulk orders to burned addresses (ene). there are more examples, but overall, the basics are the same. Anyone here could be a cop (in my mind, everyone here IS a cop), so don&#039;t risk yourself based on the &quot;it hasn&#039;t happened yet&quot; bullshit that spreads around here like wildfire. <br /><br />Titanic was unsinkable until it sank, the O-rings on the challenger shuttle were OK until they broke, and Osama Bin Laden was alive until he wasn&#039;t, so lets not get lulled into a warm sense of security, because what goes on here is not legal in most places, and there are people trying to stop it every single day.

If it was common there would be no silk road...dummy. You saying that it takes you a while to trust new vendors is about the only thing you have said that I have no problem with. I think every person on here is skeptical of a new vendor. Though if they stay in escrow there is little to no risk at all. But still it is hard to be one of the new vendors first customer. And it is even harder being a new vendor! You have to answer 1000 questions over and over again. Even if you answer them all in your vendor profile...people still feel they have to ask.. just so they feel more comfortable...then when they finally do place an order they will start messaging you within 3 hours wanting a DCN(even though you state that you won&#039;t give them out) and they will go into the rumor mill and make a stupid post about if anyone has dealt with you and how they are nervous because it has been 27 hours and they have not got there package yet(even though you told them it is 2-5 days)...or it has been 8 minutes and they have not got a return message..( only to find out had they refreshed their own page ...the vendor responded 5 min ago). Then you will have more idiots that have not done business with you yet will accuse you of being LEO. Then 10 more will comment how they know you are an old vendor ...do to how you made a sentence. Then 2 days will past and the OP will get his package and everything will be perfect and he will leave you feedback how he got it in less then 3 days from the other side of the country...yet he will give you advice on how to package your shipments..even though he has never shipped any&nbsp; drugs in his life. Then he will tell you how you should print your address labels because hand written labels stand out in the 6 billion packages a year that USPS deals with.... Oh and as for the bullshit thread he made about you???

I don&#039;t even need to comment ...as by now we have realized how you want to put into peoples minds how they should or should not respond.But I will ;D. Of course the problem with your silly request is.... there is no fucking person to respond to this(but me) as NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN BUSTED! FACT!!! I like how you try and point out how you know this is a stupid post that will get a lot of response from the &quot;crazy&#039;s&quot; on here that love to post on these &quot;So and so is LEO&quot; and &quot;So and so got busted&quot; total bullshit threads. This tells me that you&nbsp; have read these silly post before and you know just how many people will come in here and post total bullshit. What you should have said is this----- &quot; I know this post is about the stupidest thing I can post besides &quot;I am selling BTC for $3 a coin and taking Paypal&quot; or&quot; PGP is a must!&quot; but I am high as shit and paranoid as fuck and I needed to make a post ... So I chose this stupid topic because it has been at least one week since someone made a post about a vendor getting busted..and the last &quot;Vendor getting busted&quot; thread was not about an American!!!!..So I thought I would start this... I&nbsp; also threw in the word &quot;Honeypot&quot; to mix it up a bit and add something that could totally happen(not)! In fact ...I am sure it has happened and they just did not come forward.. so please.... the usual suspects..do not post in here.. Thanks&quot;<br /><br />That would have been a better OP.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47737.msg501878#msg501878">Quote from: sweetbro on October 04, 2012, 10:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">also if you have less than 10 posts it would be better if you did not respond to this thread. no throwaway accounts for this one please<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is one of my favorite paragraphs by you.. Talk about calling the kettle black! I love how you used the number 10...Yea ..if they have over 10 they are totally legit and valued members of the community! And for this thread...of course no throw away accounts!!! (like yours) I mean.... this is WAY to good an OP to have some &quot;throw away&quot; account respond! It needs valued members like yourself who have been on here an contributed to this forum.. Your other 12 posy were really, really good by the way :D<br /><br /><br />So there you go... Why did you make a new account for this post? I already answered that...but still would like to hear your great reason(s). Also why use the term HONEYPOT??? Do you actually believe LE would become a vendor to bust buyers??? Or as your title says ... to bust vendors? Do you actually believe honeypots exist? Or did you just throw that on there?<br /><br />I am not someone that believes&nbsp; a vendor will never get busted. I just do not think it will be because of Silk Road. There i s a 1000000x more likely a chance that a vendor gets popped IRL.actually is has to happen one day I think just based on the number of vendors on here. I hope it never does.<br /><br />There are so many problems with LE setting up buyer or vendor accounts to bust people on here. It is a legit topic and would take a post 20 times loner then this dumb one(mine...not yours) to explain to people why it would not be worth their time and/or it would be very hard to get evidence to get an actual conviction. I know they would like to. I am sure they are trying. But SR has a great system in place. The BTC is pretty fucking sweet. If everyone follows the SR rules and takes normal common sense precautions... it would be pretty tough to get busted being a vendor on here. And I think it would be almost impossible to get busted being a buyer.<br /><br />Still being cautious is smart. Being paranoid is your choice. Some people can not help themselves. Others are paranoid because of the drugs they take. Some will&nbsp; tell you&quot; it is good to be a little paranoid&quot;.(it&#039;s not) but I can agree with all that. Whatever. <br /><br />What is really wrong with all these types of post is that there are a lot of total idiots in here. ( there have been people that have actually gone to mtgix.com to buy BTC at $6 a coin and didnt realize they were getting fucked!)<br /><br />They will read these bullshit post and actually believe it as facts. Then they will in turn not use SR. I know this because as a vendor I get at least 10 questions a month from &quot;buyers&quot; that will ask me if I am ok because they &quot;herd&quot; (read) that vendors are getting busted! I of course tell them they read wrong and explain how it just didn&#039;t happen and I am just fine. They will go on to tell me they, after &quot;hearing&quot; that news decided not to make any purchases and lay low!! I can&#039;t believe that is true... but it is. <br /><br />This is why I am so against these type of post.(not this one really as I am just against this one because it is so fucking stupid) Not only because they are factually wrong but spreading paranoia... when their all ready is a layer of it &quot;naturally&quot; ...since we are online buying and selling illegal drugs... is just stupid. <br /><br />We should be starting threads about how &quot;no one has ever been in trouble because of Silk Road&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;How great and safe the BTC is. <br /><br />How many great vendors there are on here and how THEY take all the risk<br /><br />&nbsp;How awesome a job DPR and friends have done with the security of this site. <br /><br />Just more positive post about the good things. Not these bullshit, paranoid, nonsense that NEVER proves to be true. EVER!<br /><br />So I guess it is time for another post about how important pgp is!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If you read this far...sorry I wrote this. I wanted to delete it ...but every time I went too...I read the OP and I could not help myself and I hit the post button.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Agreed. <br /><br />Fear the worst, hope for the best. Cover your ass in the meantime. <br /><br />Would LEO want to harass people buying personal quantities on SR? Not really. It&#039;s one thing (like on COPS) to discover drugs on a person who is committing some other crime. It&#039;s quite another to go through the trouble of a controlled delivery of a personal quantity of some drug. <br /><br />Bulk orders on the other hand, and bulk orders that carry a price low enough to profit IRL, would be of interest to LEO. <br /><br />LEO is all about &quot;cutting off the head of the snake.&quot; They know that harassing buyers would have a temporary effect on SR business.

It will cost a few coins, but much cheaper than getting someone to go break their legs or worse.<br /><br />The problem with a honeypot vendor is there&#039;s so much plausible deniability that LE would essentially need an IRL case against the buyer, not just something supposedly purchased by them. It wouldn&#039;t seem worth the time and costs involved, since they can&#039;t even keep up with the bulk buyers on the street and it really only gives them a list of potential targets which they may already know, and it would only really be useful for domestic buyers. In some jurisdictions they could also have issues with evidentiary process, since they&#039;d have a difficult time proving the initial evidence they obtained was linked to the suspect - if they go digging into his IRL activities it may not be admissible as a result.<br /><br />tl;dr - it isn&#039;t worth LE&#039;s time

He admitted that the shipping, communication, and product were all great, but had a hissy fit over the powder to pebble ratio, which is actually really insignificant. I cant believe the shit vendors have to go through even when they are doing amazing jobs. Thanks for putting up with us!

				As previously state, honey pot leo vendors are almost impossibleto exsist, and extremely easy to detect, if they ever come to SR.&nbsp; Cops cannot sell drugs build a reputation and then sell a big quanity and then bust you.&nbsp; ITS IMPOSSIBLE<br /><br />Cops cannot sell anyone drugs and let people use/ sell them, the only thing they could do is sell them to you and bust you immediately. <br /><br />The only chance of anyone getting busted by a LEO for buying on SR, is if your a complete dumbass and decide to make a big purchase off a brand new vendor.&nbsp; Its also possible in theory, if a big vendor gets busted and says hes selling on SR, to make big sales to catch big buyers.&nbsp; But once again EXTREMELY unlikely, once they find the supplier there is hardly any point in going for the smaller guys.<br /><br />People should stop worrying about LEO Honeypot vendors, its extremely unlikely and stupid for cops to even bother, the only chance a Honeypot vendor could exsist is if he is brand new, no sales, and you make a big buy, thats it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not forsee honeypot vendors ever making an impact on SR, if by the small chance they even attempt it.

				Rule of thumb;<br /><br />Don&#039;t stockpile.

Well, if you ever get raided (warrant issued),&nbsp; they&#039;ll find a stockpile of drugs. That never ends well. Where as if they found your emergency stash, that&#039;s just possession.
