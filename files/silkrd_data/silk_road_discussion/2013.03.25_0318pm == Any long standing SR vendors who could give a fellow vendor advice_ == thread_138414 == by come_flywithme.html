In my opinion, no vendor should have a no refund policy unless the orders are tracked. Tracking says delivered = no refund, tracking says undeliverable...come to a civil agreement.

				Oldest buyer scam trick in the SR book. No DCN? Claim item not received. A DCN is small price to pay for insurance against level 1 buyer scams. <br /><br />Level 2 buyer scam; (Considering you have a DCN, Level 1 is thwarted). So a Level 2 buyer scam is claiming poor quality product. It only works when there is little to no other feedback about said product. They take advantage of this fact knowing that under these circumstances, they can get up to 50% or more of their funds back and as a weapon of inducement, attempt to hold your rating hostage via feedback threat of 1/5 unless you give in. These unscrupulous sort are more numerous than you can imagine. You can give into their demands or you can call their bluff by stating that the matter must go through SR resolutions. Here is where they usually stop because they want to avoid a ding to their stats - refund rate specifically. But they will leave a 1/5 out of spite for you having called their bluff. <br /><br />This is a black market. Moreover, an anonymous black market. Neither buyer nor seller can protect themselves from unsavory sorts who hide behind the anonymity which TOR affords them. There are no laws, no institutions of enforceable redress, only the trust in human decency to do the right thing far more often than the wrong thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Take your hit as a lesson learned. Experience is a cruel teacher, for she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />♔ Sir Pillsalot<br /><br /><br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br /><br />The Gentleman Lords of Pharmaceuticals.<br />Serving US Patrons from within the US.<br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br />

				Don&#039;t use tracking. In the UK you are required to send by a special service with Royal Mail to get tracking which means you will be on CCTV with the package(s) in hand. <br /><br />I always go into the post office to get proof of postage for REGULAR mail. i.e. I attach stamps to the mail and hand it straight to the desk assistant. They print off the receipts for the mail and off I go. <br /><br />Also, England to Northern Ireland is theoretically UK&gt;UK so you have nothing to worry about. It doesn&#039;t pass through any customs barrier. The buyer is definately trying to pull the wool over your eyes.<br /><br />Dank

				Funny how he makes no mention of the buyers stats.

This is going to happen a lot. When I first started back over a year ago, &quot;scammers&quot; were imo virtually non-existant, but they kept increasing as the buyer base increased too. It&#039;s sad, and it&#039;s your choice how to deal with it. <br /><br />I always had a 100% refund option up til &#039;13 february, because I almost never had to refund or reship anybody! <br /><br />Tracking is indeed a viable option, but in cases like mine with dozens of packages a day, it&#039;s impossible to go into a post office with heaps of packages and get tracking on everything. On top of that, many countries won&#039;t even do tracking, meaning I get a shitload of scamming russians. <br /><br />What (smart) scammers will also do at times, is create a bunch of accounts, buy bogus listings for a couple bucks to create a &quot;history&quot; of sorts, and then still scam around with different accounts and have it sent to the same address all around. Too bad Silkroad doesn&#039;t like you saving addresses whatsoever.

				Message the buyer.<br /><br />Tell him that you upheld your part of the deal and that his negative feedback is unfair and will hurt your business.<br /><br />Tell him that&nbsp; you will not sell to anyone who leaves less than perfect feedback. So he either changes the feedback or you blacklist him.<br /><br />There isn&#039;t much else you can do.&nbsp; <br /><br />TBH the best thing would have been to send him another free package, right now the feedback is worth more to you than the package.
