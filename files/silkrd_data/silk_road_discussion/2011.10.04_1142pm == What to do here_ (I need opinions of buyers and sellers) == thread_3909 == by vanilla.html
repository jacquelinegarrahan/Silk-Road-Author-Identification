				I recently shipped out a package that was returned to sender due to there being no such address as the one I shipped to. Can I as a seller be help responsible for this? I checked it on google maps as I always do and it shows up there. However this package will not be delivered and was returned to sender (obviously at an address that isn&#039;t mine). It seems to me that the buyer (who is a new buyer, no other order history) is more to blame than I am for giving an address that doesn&#039;t exist. I did offer to reship to an actual address but it appears that this user doesn&#039;t log in all that often and has not yet read my message. If this goes to resolution what will happen? I welcome any opinions from the rest of the road.

				Perhaps not but I did offer to reship it to the guy. I would rather do that than issue a refund. Anyone can make a mistake and this is his first order. I just haven&#039;t had this happen until now so I am not really sure how to deal with it. There are still 10 days left until resolution so perhaps he will log in and we can get it worked out. I&#039;m just wondering what the rules are for resolution in a case like this. Anyone run into this and have a resolution ruling?

				I haven&#039;t been in a resolution situation but from what I&#039;ve read most rulings go to a 50/50 refund unless the vendor can provide proof of shipment then it&#039;s 0% refund.<br /><br />It&#039;s probably best to talk it over with him before you let it get to the resolution stage.

				Ok so I did finally hear back from this guy. And of course it turns out he gave me a totally bogus address last time. It wasn&#039;t even on the right street. SO anyhow I did reship his stuff but he wanted it by a specific date. If he would have given me the right info in the first place it would have been there over a week ago. Really chaps my ass that I have to worry about this kind of thing with customers. I really hope this guy gives good feedback after this ordeal.

You&#039;ve gone above and beyond what would be reasonably expected from a vendor in this situation. From the sound of it this buyer could cause problems for other sellers in the future. What is his name so I can avoid him? If you don&#039;t feel comfortable posting it in public PM me please. Thanks!

				Well it was the guy&#039;s first order on here. I didn&#039;t want to ruin it for him. BEsides it was a smaller order. Not too much lost. IF he happens to order again I&#039;ll break even so it&#039;s all good. Good Karma pays off man.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				Wait, this guy KNOWINGLY GAVE you a nonexistent address, causing an expensive, dirty pack to be shipped to your poor random unsuspecting RETURN address, who will likely open it and call the police, resulting in a fingerprint dust and investigation, (the smaller the town that return address is in, the bigger that investigation will be), plus wasted your time and energy putting it together, doubtless while the money remains in escrow, AND you&#039;re being good enough to ship it AGAIN to a new address, in essence trusting this unknown fool AGAIN`? <br />I own a LEGIT business and I wouldn&#039;t do that for a customer who caused me that kind of PTA. Instead he would get a &quot;controlled delivery&quot; in the form of my foot in his ass.<br />You sir, are a saint. Honestly perhaps TOO kind. People need to get in the habit that YOU FOLLOW PROTOCOL OR YOU LOSE YOUR FUCKING BITCOIN. Otherwise, sellers will eventually find that SR and online sales in general are just not profitable because they&#039;re overrun with stupid customers. <br />And that&#039;s a relatively new, small purchase customer&#039;s point of view. I&#039;m as retail as they get, and I advocate a no returns, no second ships or second chances policy. <br />If you can prove you shipped it, the coins should be released in my opinion, and if he admits he gave you a bogus address... well... no more candy for him.<br />
