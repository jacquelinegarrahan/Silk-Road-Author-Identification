				I don&#039;t know if this is the right place to make a big stink, but someone needs to hear this. A few weeks ago I purchased DMT from the vendor elvis, a top rated vendor. I trusted this individual to send the product I had paid for, even paying extra for priority mail to have the whole tracking feature so we&#039;re both protected in case something happens.<br /><br />Lo and behold I never got the DMT, and I ended up going on vacation for the holidays. I wasn&#039;t mad, I figured that like other top rated vendors he wouldn&#039;t mind a reship, so I asked for that instead of a refund. Fair enough right? He responds by telling me like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, no reship only 50% discount. I informed elvis that I was overseas and that I wouldn&#039;t be able to add bitcoins to my account, that I had been scammed before by another top vendor, F16, and that I didn&#039;t really want to pay more money to get the product that I originally paid for unless he could provide proof that he even shipped it. <br /><br />From the whole F16 fiasco, I figured that the SR mods would want to see where the fault was, if it was undeliverable or even sent at all, in order to resolve the issue and mitigate refunds. Elvis never provided the tracking number and he kept accusing me of being a scammer who wanted extra product, when all I tried to do was explain to him my past history and ask him how his discount would work. English is not his first language, so I had no idea exactly how he wanted to play this out. Like any coupon you get in real life for 50% off there are terms and conditions, but I didn&#039;t know what his were. Again, he told me to fuck off and wouldn&#039;t answer any of my messages, finally telling me that he would only offer me a 1% refund since he thinks I&#039;m a scammer.<br /><br />Buddy, if I was the scammer, why do you have my money? I was waiting for SR staff to intervene and do the right thing. I had left several intelligent comments and statements in the resolution center while elvis had deleted all the messages he had made. He was acting really shady and elitest, basically undermining what this community stands for. Sorry but just because I don&#039;t have an extensive purchase history doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m a scammer. I&#039;ve had good dealings on here with other vendors. <br /><br />Anyway, I had hoped that SR mods would do the right thing and intervene and hopefully take my side since I wasn&#039;t asking for much, just proof and a reship. Fair enough right? SR mods didn&#039;t bother to read any of my statements and issued me a 1% refund. Seriously? What the hell SR mods? After I got scammed by F16, you assured me that next time if I didn&#039;t FE I&#039;d be protected and that a mod would step in and help, yet here I am without product and without my money. I don&#039;t want to get carried away with accusations, but I feel like SR mods are protecting a top rated vendor and shitting on the little guys. I&#039;m probably not the only little guy this happens to, especially with the influx of new users to SR this year. Who knows who else the SR mods have been screwing over? <br /><br />Either way, it&#039;s disgraceful and disgusting that this should happen. I did everything right, and yet I get screwed over. Is there no longer ANY protection on this site?

				Unfortunate as written. Should be clear that a 1% refund is nothing more than a stick in the arse (@edar) and even much worse. It shows buyers that some vendors are seemingly above the law, and this is very disturbing for an already worried customer base.

				i bought jungle spice from elvis before and when i asked him about it he would indirectly respond to questions and never really answer anything fully. when i got it i was psyched as it was my first purchase on the road, but when i tried it i was pretty let down when i compared it to my buddies dmt. im guessing the actual nn,dmt content in it was quite low, even though he labeled it as &quot;jungle spice dmt&quot;<br /><br />i asked if he had pulled the nn dmt out of it with naptha, and he simply said back. &quot;naptha was used in the extraction process&quot;<br />seemed very dodgy to me. ive had amazing experiences with rogerpetes 98% pure synthetic dmt, and so did all of my friends. i couldnt recommend him enough for dmt seriously. he will for sure pull through for you, outstanding dude.<br /><br />but from the sounds of it you arent in the usa are you? if you dont mind telling us your country of origin thatd be great. it can help give us some insight on the situation and why he might be acting unreasonable towards you...?<br />

				Yeah I feel for ya mate<br /><br />I had a similar thing happen to me.<br /><br />Made an order with a vendor for over $600<br />the vendor turned out be a fraud and left SR.<br />Had my BTC in escrow and asked res centre<br />to give me a 100% refund since it was clear <br />the vendor did not send anyhing in the first place. <br /><br />Prior to I wrote numerous emails to SR customer service<br />making them aware of what was happening and<br />my suspicions about this vendor, but at that time<br />SR was having internal issues and they did not <br />reply to any of my messages till weeks later..<br /><br />So with my trans in resolution I asked them to review<br />my case and to give me a 100% refund without having<br />my refund rate destroyed (this is possible) as it was clear to everyone<br />that the vendor DID NOT SEND ANYTHING and I was<br />not the only one being scammed.!<br /><br />However 1 day later SR res centre had come up with <br />the genious descision to give me a 0% refund as<br />this would not influece my stats?? &gt;:( and they had <br />released my $600 to the scammer!!&nbsp; <br />That is without sending any email telling me that they would not be able to give a refund<br />without influencing my stats and that the only way was to send<br />my funds to the scammer.<br />When I confronted them with it was too late and nothing<br />could been done for me. <br /><br />The frustrating thing was that the vendor had already offered <br />a 60% refund but I did not take it as I was 100% clear he never<br />send any product and thought a 100% refund was fair.<br /><br />So beware SR resolution and SR customer service are not the<br />same crew and they do not communicate with each other.<br />I found out the hard way.<br /><br />Good luck

It&#039;s my country of origin and where I had the product shipped. I&#039;m on vacation right now in the middle of the world so responding takes a bit of time, but the product was shipped to my US house address, as I&#039;ve only been here since Christmas. I shouldn&#039;t have had any issues at all. Elvis is a domestic seller and I had ordered a ton of 25c blotters the same day from another vendor that made it out to me with no issues before I left. <br /><br />I know for a fact that the DMT never made it out to me at all, and elvis wouldn&#039;t even confirm that he sent it. I did everything right, paid for priority mail to be protected, but still got fucked. What else can I really do besides spreading my story around? This is the second time I get screwed by a top vendor on here, and now my refund rate is screwed as well. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think SR staff even bothered to read the resolution messages or even see that the vendor had originally offered 50% before concluding with the help of his space elves that I was a &quot;skamm3r.&quot; If they did, they&#039;re surely protecting this guy. <br /><br />Edit: The funds have left escrow since I now have a higher account balance, so does this mean that my money won&#039;t be recoverable anymore? Could staff seize funds from other payments in escrow that were supposed to go to him and allocate it to me?<br /><br />

				Always use escrow. The only reason vendors would be disinclined to use this is because they&#039;re trying to rip you off.

				Resolution tips.<br /><br />1.

I did everything right, submitted a counter offer with every updated statement, and actually communicated with the seller and left about 8 resolution updates and statements in the resolution page. The seller deleted all his counter offers and messages and updated the page with the last word of 1% right before the resolution expired. SR staff should have, according to the process, read all the statements made and then made a decision not just automatically accepting the very last counter offer without discussing this with the vendor and I. No one looked at anything, they just automatically took the vendor&#039;s side. Even then, since when the hell is a 1% offer a good resolution? <br /><br />I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. I LEFT NO ROOM FOR ERROR ON MY PART. This was totally gross negligence on SR staff&#039;s part, and definitely malicious by the vendor. What can you do for me now?

				Markymark609 obviously there was a tracking number or silk road would not have ruled in favor of the vendor, and as far as the postal system you should know by now how government run programs operate. In case your not <br />smart enough to figure it out they run like shit. I to have lost a few orders the last few weeks. One was an order for 1 gram of meth for $90 . A week and a half of no product i finally contacted vendor and got my DCN.<br />&nbsp;(Some vendors will not give out DCN by the way). When i looked up DCN it said undeliverable as addressed. I was certain that my address was correct. As much as i hated to i went to the post office with my DCN and they had extra info in there system.<br />&nbsp;<br />At 7:36 AM priority mail envelope was scanned as received at 7:47 AM it was typed in the system as having noticeable damage, than at 8:46 AM it was returned to sender. So I was told the noticeable damage either partially or fully tore off the delivery address. Needless to say I never got my product. A few weeks ago I also received a package that was supposed to have a $130 gram of coke in it tore open from the side with contents missing and labels from my post office saying received without contents.<br />Both orders I finalized on and took a loss because in my mind it was not the vendors fault. So it may be rude but you are making a big fuss about a measly $35 even after you were offered a 50% refund. Sorry to say but a lot of vendors are the way they are because of dumb fucks like you.

				Over 30 replies and no one bothered to ask how much was lost?&nbsp; That&#039;s funny.&nbsp; Also funny, implicating SR staff as if they helped conspire to rip off $35.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a couple packages that never made it.&nbsp; It happens, unfortunately, but you have to consider vendor stats before levying the &#039;ripped off&#039; claim.

				Elvis has always been a stand up vendor and on the road for longer than I.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered several times and not had issues, so it sounds like someone is expecting platinum service with a tin foil budget.<br /><br />If Elvis had a DCN (and I&#039;ve seen his packs, they do) then it got delivered to the address you provided, if you didn&#039;t provide a properly formatter address or some such and you didn&#039;t get your package then thats on you and while %1 seems like a slap in the face at first glance I&#039;m inclined to side with elvis&#039;s side of the story and if you were that rediculous to me I&#039;d have done the same. If he had DCN and provided it to SR support and you had kept your yap shut you would have gotten %50, if he didn&#039;t have it you may have gotten %100 if you have reasonable stats but you just basically decided to be a complete jerkoff and you got served.<br /><br />Sorry dude, learn to work with people, not demand things from them and you will probably do a little better next time.

				As a vendor I can relate to Elvis a little about scammers. Its so......many people on here scamming the hell outta us vendors its starting not even be worth the trouble of selling on here anymore. And the fact that SR has this one sided rating system makes it worst. Because what they do is extort us via our rating by saying they never got it, didn&#039;t like it, this is the wrong product etc. and unfortunate we don&#039;t have anyway to rate them as customers. Its really unfortunate because it makes honest customers and venders jobs a lot harder. But the first time you had an issue and the vendor offered you 60% you should&#039;ve taken it and learned from that situation. I&#039;m with you about the tracking. I don&#039;t know why some vendors don&#039;t give you the tracking automatically. It seems like good business to me.

A few weeks ago I purchased DMT from the vendor elvis, a top rated vendor. I trusted this individual to send the product I had paid for, even paying extra for priority mail to have the whole tracking feature so we&#039;re both protected in case something happens.<br /><br />Lo and behold I never got the DMT, and I ended up going on vacation for the holidays. I wasn&#039;t mad, I figured that like other top rated vendors he wouldn&#039;t mind a reship, so I asked for that instead of a refund. Fair enough right? He responds by telling me like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, no reship only 50% discount. I informed elvis that I was overseas and that I wouldn&#039;t be able to add bitcoins to my account, that I had been scammed before by another top vendor, F16, and that I didn&#039;t really want to pay more money to get the product that I originally paid for unless he could provide proof that he even shipped it. <br /><br />From the whole F16 fiasco, I figured that the SR mods would want to see where the fault was, if it was undeliverable or even sent at all, in order to resolve the issue and mitigate refunds. Elvis never provided the tracking number and he kept accusing me of being a scammer who wanted extra product, when all I tried to do was explain to him my past history and ask him how his discount would work. English is not his first language, so I had no idea exactly how he wanted to play this out. Like any coupon you get in real life for 50% off there are terms and conditions, but I didn&#039;t know what his were. Again, he told me to fuck off and wouldn&#039;t answer any of my messages, finally telling me that he would only offer me a 1% refund since he thinks I&#039;m a scammer.<br /><br />Buddy, if I was the scammer, why do you have my money? I was waiting for SR staff to intervene and do the right thing. I had left several intelligent comments and statements in the resolution center while elvis had deleted all the messages he had made. He was acting really shady and elitest, basically undermining what this community stands for. Sorry but just because I don&#039;t have an extensive purchase history doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m a scammer. I&#039;ve had good dealings on here with other vendors. <br /><br />Anyway, I had hoped that SR mods would do the right thing and intervene and hopefully take my side since I wasn&#039;t asking for much, just proof and a reship. Fair enough right? SR mods didn&#039;t bother to read any of my statements and issued me a 1% refund. Seriously? What the hell SR mods? After I got scammed by F16, you assured me that next time if I didn&#039;t FE I&#039;d be protected and that a mod would step in and help, yet here I am without product and without my money. I don&#039;t want to get carried away with accusations, but I feel like SR mods are protecting a top rated vendor and shitting on the little guys. I&#039;m probably not the only little guy this happens to, especially with the influx of new users to SR this year.

				In my recent experience with elvis I received a gram of jungle DMT despite ordering the premium listing.&nbsp; After I messaged he/she about the mixup, the difference between the price in products was sent to me, before I had finalized.&nbsp; It was nice, but I do wish the premium had been sent, as I found the jungle wasn&#039;t too potent.<br /><br />Sounds like elvis just got paranoid and resolution just fucked up.

ALWAYS respond to the resolution center, if a vendor or buyer puts in X amount of refund, put in what you think is fair (counter offer) and put the reason.<br />2, ALWAYS communicate in the resolution center. Dont send Support a question about a resolution. Put in your issue in the&nbsp; RC as well as sending a message to SR support.<br />3.When we send a message warning you that a resolution is set to expire, look at it and respond to the RC.<br /><br />If you do these three things, you will have a much better experience in the RC. Granted, we aren&#039;t going to make EVERYONE happy, but we look at the buyers stats, vendors stats and the posts in the rc center and the offers.. We then do our best in making a decision.<br /><br />Whenever I see people unhappy about a resolution, most of the time&nbsp; they didnt do one or all of the above. When the vendor put in 1 percent refund, most likely there wasn&#039;t a counter offer by the buyer. Remember, when there is only one resolution offered and it expires (remember we send out warning pm saying its going to expire) the system will automatically do what that one person offered. The only time a live person looks at it is if there are resolutions submitted&nbsp; by both parties..<br /><br />~Flush<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am in a similar situation and have responded through the RC system.&nbsp; Do I delete older offers or does the system simply pick the latest offer?&nbsp; I initially offered for more time for the package to arrive but the seller still hasn&#039;t responded.&nbsp; Deadline is almost up and I put in request for refund.&nbsp; Do I delete previous offers?&nbsp; Can admins see the history and see that I&#039;ve been trying to resolve the issue then?
