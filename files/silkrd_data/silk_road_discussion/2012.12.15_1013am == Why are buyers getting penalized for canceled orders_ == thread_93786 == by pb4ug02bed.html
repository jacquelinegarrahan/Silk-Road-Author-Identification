				Just made a hedged order for $360, and $346 is in escrow. If order cancels, I get only 346 back. WHY? <br />I noticed this when I made a large order for 125 btc. It got canceled next day, and I got back 118.5 btc. Why the hell am i being charged $90 as a buyer for a canceled transaction? according to the hedge (btc&#039;s went up about 10 cents), I was only supposed to get about $12 less back. Then I realized, that the money they put in escrow already has a fee taken from money you put in, and when they return money, they do it at an increased BTC value (ie.. if I purchase, then btc is worth 13.5, but if they are returning dollars to me, then for some reason btc is worth 13.9). That&#039;s messed up, SR. <br /><br />

				There were 2 listings for the item i was buying. One was for $1670, and you don&#039;t have to FE, or for $1590 and you have to FE. Well, I didn&#039;t wanna get scammed, so i paid the extra $200 to not FE, and he just canceled it next day.

				Afaik when you cancel you still get charged for SR fees.&nbsp; Those are 2-10% depending on how big the order was.<br />If you are a new buyer he might cancelled because you made a big purchase, if that&#039;s the case start low and build up your stats.

				It&#039;s not SR fees, it&#039;s hedging.<br /><br />When a hedged item is ordered SR automagically exchanges the BTC in escrow to USD at the current market rate. This protects a vendor against drastic drops in BTC price. When the payment is released from escrow or the order is canceled and money released back to the buyer, SR does the reverse transaction and sells the USD for BTC at the current exchange rate. Selling and buying at current market prices costs the difference between the ask-bid price (ask-bid spread) which, according to SR, usually adds up to around 4%.<br /><br />If the item is unhedged, on cancellation you get back 100% of what you payed.

The wrong person is being penalized those 4%. I wasn&#039;t the one who canceled, and I did nothing wrong. There were no rules on the vendor&#039;s page about who is allowed to purchase and who isn&#039;t. I have been a member for 7 months and have almost $3k of purchases with 0 refunds on this buyer account.&nbsp; &nbsp;He canceled, without sending a single message to me about why. Why should I be penalized for doing nothing wrong. The seller takes $0 fees and I take $90 fees for his mistake of either not having the product or letting me purchase something and then getting scared to ship it. There&#039;s something wrong with that set up. Sure, it&#039;s fine that they take $12 from me for the price fluctuation. But taking $90 because I have to pay 4% hedge fees is ridiculous, unless it was indeed MY fault for not following the vendor&#039;s guidelines. I spend over 1,000 USD a month here, and every time I make a big order and the seller screws up, I get penalized (this wasn&#039;t the first time).&nbsp; I recently switched to this account because my previous big order got refunded because the seller;s friend &quot;forgot to put mailing addresses on the orders.&quot; I lost hundreds of dollars, and it screwed up my refund% stats big time,&nbsp; and SR support could do nothing about it. The reason I lost hundreds, was because this order was unhedged, and the seller obviously refunded me because I purchased when btc&#039;s were $15.40, and price fell to less than $10 next day , so he didn&#039;t want to sell at that price and pretended like he screwed up. I contacted SR Support. No help. Sorry that I&#039;m getting off topic here.<br /><br />Well, I&#039;m just gonna order OOE from my regulars from now on until this problem is fixed.

				Hedging protects against BTC fluctuations and this protection comes with a price. If the item was not hedged but you had lost because of BTC fluctuations you would probably cry about why the item was not hedged. So, no matter if one chooses to hedge or not hedge orders, there is no way to always do it right to everybody.<br /><br />A vendor can have a variety of reasons why he cancels an order. There is no obligation to accept every order. It would be a thing of courtesy to let the buyer know why an order was cancelled, but you are not entitled to an explanation.<br /><br />To protect yourself against the same thing to happen again, i would contact the vendor before placing the order to make sure it will be accepted, especially if so much many is involved.

				Here&#039;s my gripe - yes, not making an order you plan on canceling is obvious. However - I&#039;ve seen (and dealt with) shipping options not appearing for &#039;hot&quot; items that are flying off the shelves. <br /><br />While it&#039;s not ideal, I prefer, if the vendor is reliable, to buy items that are either part of the order, or similar value, then PMing saying that the shipping is fucked, if you want to cancel (either for accuracy, ore more importantly, to have the proper number of transactions/feedbacks) and have me just re-order once it&#039;s fixed. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had too many things come up where either shipping options are incorrect, or not per their profile (like 1 shipping fee then $0 for other things in the same box. They the have to cancel the order and either custom list or re-setup the existing listings. <br /><br />Getting dinged for site failure pulling proper shipping opens shouldn&#039;t hit the buyer or selller - if it&#039;s DB issues not pulling their proper shipping options, how is it fair that I lose coins because I have to order immediately to ensure things don&#039;t sell out. <br /><br />Rare circumstance, but if you&#039;re ordering $500 + shipping, and your $501 balance is now whatever, $490, and you are $10 short....that&#039;s just fucking silly. <br /><br />/rant

				I understand the percentage penalty for an order cancelled while using the escrow system - the problem really resides in the fact, that the majority of buyers are unaware of these fees that they incur.<br /><br />The information regarding cancellation is out there but in a place most customers overlook.<br /><br />ce<br />

				You are right, the hedging fees should be clearly stated, so one can easily consider this factor. As it is now, you&#039;ll see if an item is hedged only *after* placing an item into the shopping cart and inspecting the cart.

If order cancels, I get only 346 back. WHY? <br />I noticed this when I made a large order for 125 btc. It got canceled next day, and I got back 118.5 btc. Why the hell am i being charged $90 as a buyer for a canceled transaction? according to the hedge (btc&#039;s went up about 10 cents), I was only supposed to get about $12 less back. Then I realized, that the money they put in escrow already has a fee taken from money you put in, and when they return money, they do it at an increased BTC value (ie.. if I purchase, then btc is worth 13.5, but if they are returning dollars to me, then for some reason btc is worth 13.9).
