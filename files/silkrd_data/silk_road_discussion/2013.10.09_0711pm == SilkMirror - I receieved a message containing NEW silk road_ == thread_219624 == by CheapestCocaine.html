				You are a vendor. They want to arrest you, it&#039;s a trap. Do not be tempted by greed. Do not fall for any traps. Just cool off for now and be patient! It&#039;s probably the fbi.

				Doesn&#039;t sound good.<br /><br />Where did you receive the message?&nbsp; Through these forums, a compromised email address (read:&nbsp; tormail), or something else?

				Hello,<br />I am one of the people working on the old Silk Road marketplace and I would just like to inform You, that we were able to transport the entire page with user database from our latest backup to new site. To login, visit this page:<br /><br />http://sv3p2vkb6v54xh56.onion [DO NOT GO TO THIS ADDRESS - IT&#039;S A SCAM THAT ALSO REQUIRES SCRIPTS TO BE ENABLED]<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to create new account if you had one on old page. The database was transferred, so your old login informations will work*. Unfortunately, we were not able to transfer any of the old offers on the page, and the FBI seized all Bitcoins located on users wallets. Also, there has been a small change in rules, to provide more safety for You users and us developers. But other than that, it is pretty much the same as it was before.<br />We hope that you share the word and we can come back to the quality it was before.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Mr. G.<br /><br />*The database backup is from 9/27/2013, so if you registered after this date, you will have to register again.
