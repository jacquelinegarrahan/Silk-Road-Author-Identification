				Ok at a better location going to rewrite this really fast.<br /><br />A little about myself. I have been to college off and on. I&#039;m going to be finishing this year. I&#039;m currently 23 years old.<br />After college Ill be getting a job that will yield be about 40k starting.<br />I want to be a vendor more or less for fun. I don&#039;t see a huge income in this while doing a solo gig. I also don&#039;t trust anyone. People are POS<br /><br />Anyway I have removed the following from my list of vending<br />E- Hard to get the required mats to synthesis. I may look into again if I can find profit with buying the chems off silkroad. <br />LSD-Seems to hard to synthesis<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to be a reseller. This is more or less a hobby. If I can make a hobby into a full time job that would be great but I don&#039;t plan on it. The IRS is a big pain in the ass.<br /><br />So that really just leaves me with <br />Weed<br />Shrooms<br />Salvia- I really don&#039;t plan on moving this much anyway tbh.<br /><br />What I am looking for is advice for a person starting off. I&#039;m not looking for gimmicks on sources and how I should resell.<br /><br />The game plan is offering free samples at mailing costs to people with greater than 10 feedback.<br />As silkroad does not offer amazing sorting features for people to find vendors that is all I can really think of.<br />I will be starting off with domestic orders only. <br />I all ready have my grow setups in line.<br />This is just looking for advice on what to look out for as a vendor on the deep web and some of the risks.<br /><br /><br />

				One day guys, im going to be a real big drug dealer and your all going to be sorry you ever poked fun at me!<br /><br />Honestly, you don&#039;t wake up and say &quot;I think today I will start selling drugs.&quot; Where you gonna get all this product? You gonna redistribute from shipments you get from Holland? Now your a gloried amazon warehouse worker, and you make the same too. This aint all glory kids, its a lot of sitting in front of a vacuum sealer, and a roll of tape, yelling profanities because you forgot which box had what. I don&#039;t even own a fucking gun man. Its a shame. I do own a impluse sealer though, im pretty bad ass with that, maybe burn someones fingers or something.<br /><br />This is your plan<br />1. Become drug dealer<br />2.???????<br />3.Profit.

				Some possible things to consider:<br />Long term:<br />People do get caught and some are currently serving time for vending on the silk road. the seller sh4d1 is now doing 3 year.<br />Short term:<br />It is a very involved job requiring you to be at your computer once or twice every single day. <br />Having to trust people in real life who more than likely are drug users themselves.Communication problem, drugs dissapearing, etc<br />

				I know the cost of the products I&#039;m getting how m going about it. <br /><br />Issues I&#039;m currently facing is security for myself. I&#039;m solving that in another thread. How I go about that will determine how often I can get online. Bmr does seem to have a better rating system as you can rate buyers in there respect of drugs gone missing.

Have some college background. Plan on finishing next year. ﻿the job market does not look promising so if a life of a honest man doesn&#039;t pay than why not one that does not fall into ﻿the law. They seem to make a good earning. I would still have a job on there side that pulls in around 40k a year. <br /><br />OK so here is where I&#039;m at. Lsd seems too hard to make and mdma is very controlled on getting ﻿the chems. So it leaves me with shrooms and pot. Maybe saliva but that&#039;s a very dirty drug. <br />Shipping in the&nbsp; US is no real issue. I would want to offer international shipping but I don&#039;t want to risk customer safety. Things get a little tricky with xrays. I have some ideas how to do it but I&#039;d want to test before making it available to customers. Some input on that would be nice.<br /><br />Now also something I have thinking about is should I vend on sr or bmr<br />Sr pros<br />A lot of people use it<br />Cons<br />High start up costs<br />This is a pro/con it has a lot of media attention<br /><br />Bmr<br />Pros<br />Low start up cost<br />Allows untec savy people to send you an encrypted message. <br />Better vendor sorting options<br />Cons<br />Smaller community<br />Has withdraw fees on top of selling fees.<br /><br />I plan on low prices. Its not going to be a primary source if income. It would be nice if it would but ﻿the high profit margin drugs are harder to obtain. With weed being legal in some states has also messed ﻿the market a little.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />dang boy you sound pretty stupid for a 23 year old

				When you are ready to make money ,&nbsp; pm me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll set you up with your Own onion website , linked to Silk Road.&nbsp; You can play around all you want and you will be re-selling products from vendors to your customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s called. Re shipping.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be the middleman and let vendors do what they do best. They got the experience and know how.&nbsp; You don&#039;t. <br /><br />This your best bet to get started for free.&nbsp; Yu earn money on each sale through your onion site.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, you round up possible buyers on the clear net and provide a service to them. They can take the risk of using Silk Road themselves and having to learn all about it. -or you can take care of this for them so to speak.&nbsp; <br /><br />Make it easy for them.&nbsp; Rely on Silk roads security and escrow for the final part of the sale.&nbsp; &nbsp;You use your own onion site as a marketing tool .<br /><br />You can sell (re sell) any product on Silk Road.&nbsp; The vendors here become your suppliers. They don&#039;t even know. You are the customer making the buys for your clients. <br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; there area t scenarios.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is just a free option wih no investment.

You probably shouldn&#039;t be vending. Don&#039;t be a vendor, you will end up being arrested for accepting a paypal payment. Only once you have accpected the fact that you might one day have a man lick your butt with grape jelly, then you are prepared to vend.<br />
