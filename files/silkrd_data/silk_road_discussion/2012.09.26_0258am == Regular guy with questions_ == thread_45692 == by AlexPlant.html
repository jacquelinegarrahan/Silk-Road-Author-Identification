				Ok, So I was doing an internet search for some mail order hydrocodone pills. Nothing major but thought maybe there was a site I could order without a prescription. I came across this site and downloaded everything and registered and started looking around. So here&#039;s the deal. I am 42, have a great job and a a pretty good citizen of the small community I live in. I used to party back in the day and would love to get small amounts of some of the stuff offered here. It looks legit but obviously I have some doubts about placing an order. I&#039;m being completely transparent. I am skeptical about ordering bud from California and having it delivered to my mailbox. Surely there is someone in this community that is in my same place or was at some time. I understand how the bit currency works and I am ready to add some to my account. Can anyone that is in my shoes give me some feedback as to how confident you are in the whole process? It seems to easy. I would not risk going to someone in town here that I don&#039;t know to try to get some of the things I am interested in. I wouldn&#039;t know where or who to ask anyway. This seems like a perfect answer to some recreational activities that I am interested in. Any feedback would be appreciated it.

Any feedback would be appreciated it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ah... I remember being new to the road. I pretty much lurked SR for a few months after discovering the deep web. Not because I was afraid, but because I had no money.<br /><br />The first thing I have ever received was a free sample from a new vendor. Just a xanax pill. Was delighted that it arrived, not because it was xanax (didn&#039;t do anything to me), but because this was an indicator that SR isn&#039;t just some huge setup. When I finally started making some money, I decided to order a gram of MDMA from Pf. My first real order. It came, and damn was I happy... and that&#039;s not from the molly, lmao.<br /><br />I understand why you&#039;re so concerned. SR to a beginner just seems way too good to be true. And sometimes that&#039;s just what it is. There are scammers all over the road. Many people will say that. Don&#039;t take that the wrong way though... that doesn&#039;t mean you need to be paranoid about every vendor. You just need to be cautious. So far I&#039;ve made 19 orders in the past two or three months, half small half bulk orders, and each and every time I&#039;ve had success. Never had to ask for a refund or anything. Not because I&#039;m lucky, but because I know what I&#039;m doing with my money.<br /><br />If you didn&#039;t already know, SR has an escrow system in place. After you place an order, the vendor is supposed to ship the product, and once it arrives you can &quot;finalize&quot; to release the funds to the vendor. If something goes wrong, you can contact SR support and get your shit back if you can prove anything. However, vendors with 35 feedback or more can ask for you to finalize early, which means they get the money before you get the product. This is where you should be careful. Many vendors will waive this rule if you&#039;re a repeat customer of SR or the vendor. Each user has buying stats... and a vendor can look at these stats to determine whether you&#039;re legit or not. Here&#039;s an example (my stats):<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/account/buyer_stats<br />Total transactions: 19<br />Total spent: $862.86<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 11.67%<br />Member for: 4 months<br /><br />Vendors are generally pleased to see a refund rate of 0%. That means you&#039;ve never had to get a refund from a vendor for whatever reason.<br /><br />Any other questions just ask.<br /><br />This is coming from someone who also happens to be a regular guy. If I can do it, I&#039;m sure you can too.

				don&#039;t worry - i&#039;m sure the majority of people here have gone through that same phase of uncertainty or hesitation about ordering from SR.&nbsp; i know i did!&nbsp; but, i did my research, learned pgp, read reviews of vendors i was interested in, and eventually took a chance!&nbsp; i&#039;ve since made ~10 orders (mostly weed from CA -- but two small orders of LSD as well) and i have only had a problem with one.&nbsp; the one i had a problem with was weed coming from CO from a new vendor - the package never made it to me, but the vendor was fast to give me a 100% refund.<br /><br />anyway ... as long as you are taking proper precautions (using PGP, encrypting your address when you place an order, doing your research on the vendor in which you&#039;re interested, NEVER FINALIZING EARLY, etc.) you will have a wonderful time here!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />wish you much luck!&nbsp; and here&#039;s a +1 for you!

				Cool, thanks for the responses. I have my eye on Northern California Kings (I think) they have good feedback and happy customers. I have pretty much everything figured out but what is PGP? From what I understand I encrypt my address. I know all of this is on other forums and I hate to sound like a newbie. It seems like if I keep things small then having items delivered to my regular address with my regular name should be ok. I&#039;m in a fairly small town in the US. <br />

From my experience, almost every vendor uses it, but doesn&#039;t require. I&#039;ve only seen a couple of vendors who required it. It&#039;s up to you. When you place an order, there&#039;s a box where you type your address and name and any notes you want the vendor to know. I&#039;m not sure what happens when the vendor reads this, but I&#039;m pretty sure SR gets rid of it.

				Yeah it can be scary at first.<br /><br />The 5 big things I would mention are<br /><br />Try to avoid pot unless it&#039;s from people with VERY good packaging because it&#039;s easy to detect.<br />Try not to order from out of country too often because it will most likley raise some eyebrows from the mailman or at the post office if your getting packages from around the world on a regular basis<br />Don&#039;t Finalize Early and dont shign for packages, EVER.<br />If your worried, order during the holidays, it&#039;s less likely that anyone will notice and there will be less security because of the sheer volume that the USPS has at that time.<br />Lastly, use your real name but try spelling it one letter off, that way IF you were ever caught it&#039;s very easy to say. &quot;This is a frame job, look, my name isn&#039;t even spelled right&quot;

				As a newbie with a pending order it&#039;s really helpful to read all these positive comments related to SR. After placing the order it suddendly got me a &quot;buyer remorse&quot; feeling because now I fear that I might have screwed up the encryption thing, or maybe because I talked about my intention to buy on an imageboard (it&#039;s a foreign one with a very low number of visitor). From an objective point of view I told myself that it&#039;s higly unlikely that the police get interested on a small purchase by a random guy with no previous criminal record and they should go through a lot of shit before they could be able to prove that I actually did some purchase so I should not be worried about anything but when it&#039;s the first time you do something you screw logic in favor of instinct.

That being said, orders from some countries are more likely to be put under extra &quot;random&quot; scrutiny but on the whole it&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br />Most vendors package their orders incredibly well, and if there&#039;s nothing suspicious about a letter or package then it won&#039;t come to the attention of a postal inspector. The best vendors package their orders so well that even if it DOES come to the attention of a postal inspector in a random inspection, they won&#039;t find anything even if they punch a hole and use a spectrometer to check if for chemical signatures.<br /><br />Misspelling your name IS a &#039;red flag&#039; event. You want your order to blend in with your other mail as much as possible. A misspelled name the first one or two times might make your mailman think &quot;huh&quot; and shrug it off, but if you continue to get packages or letters with the wrong name on them, they&#039;ll stand out like a sore thumb. Put it this way: if you ordered something from Amazon or E-Bay, isn&#039;t it highly unlikely that you&#039;d spell your own name wrong when ordering?!&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Spelling it incorrectly offers you no extra protection. I mean let&#039;s be real here, if somebody were trying to frame you then you can be damn sure they&#039;d get your name right on the package, so that &quot;framing&quot; idea goes out the window.<br /><br />Use your real name, your real address, and in the unlikely event something bad happens, deny all knowledge of the package and its contents. The burden of proof rests on the prosecution - don&#039;t give them anything to work with and you&#039;ll be just fine!<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Again very helpful except for the rage against the machine guy. Reading the pros and cons on what not to do and about being paranoid reminded me about how paranoid I would get. A little paranoia is a good thing. It seems like 90% of the people I have run into so far on this site are very cool and are in the same boat. They troll around for a little while and then take a small dip. My next project is buying bit currency from Wal-Mart with cash. That should be a trip when I bring that up to the poor soul working the money order counter!

That should be a trip when I bring that up to the poor soul working the money order counter!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The following is a clearnet link, but you can access anything on the clearnet via TOR (just ensure that the little &quot;S&quot; up by the address bar looks like a &quot;No Smoking&quot; sign.

Nothing major but thought maybe there was a site I could order without a prescription. I came across this site and downloaded everything and registered and started looking around. So here&#039;s the deal. I am 42, have a great job and a a pretty good citizen of the small community I live in. I used to party back in the day and would love to get small amounts of some of the stuff offered here. It looks legit but obviously I have some doubts about placing an order. I&#039;m being completely transparent. I am skeptical about ordering bud from California and having it delivered to my mailbox. Surely there is someone in this community that is in my same place or was at some time. I understand how the bit currency works and I am ready to add some to my account. Can anyone that is in my shoes give me some feedback as to how confident you are in the whole process? It seems to easy. I would not risk going to someone in town here that I don&#039;t know to try to get some of the things I am interested in. I wouldn&#039;t know where or who to ask anyway. This seems like a perfect answer to some recreational activities that I am interested in. Any feedback would be appreciated it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There was a nearly identical post to this a few months back complete with bud hookup/friend in Cali.&nbsp; The only difference is the point was stressed a little more in the other post that due to his age and associations he didn&#039;t feel comfortable asking about droogs IRL..<br /><br />Just read around man.&nbsp; Sorry to be callous, but honestly there are ~ a dozen noobs in the forums everyday saying &quot;I&#039;m new to this, how does it work?&quot;.&nbsp; We&#039;re just wasting our time spoon feeding you.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to take the time/can&#039;t figure it out, maybe you shouldn&#039;t be here. <br /><br />With that said, once you get it down, it will be very rewarding. :)

				Hi Alex, welcome to the forum. <br /><br />I&#039;m also 42 and like you, gainfully employed. I don&#039;t want to mess around with my reputation in the community or with the police. <br /><br />Two things I would really stress are A) the importance of PGP Encryption; and B) Order only domestically. <br />PGP is actually very easy to use although for people who are uninitiated is can be a bit confusing (was for me at first) - use PGP whenever sending your address to a vendor. There are many tutorials on how to use PGP so I won&#039;t rehash them, suffice to say it&#039;s worth getting to know. Once you think your somewhat familiar with it, join Pine&#039;s PGP club and send a few test messages before going &#039;live&#039; with placing an order. You can always use me as a test guy if you want to send an encrypted message - a link to my Public Key can be found in my signature.<br /><br />Domestic ordering reduces the chance of being busted if only because your orders won&#039;t go through the border - obvious.<br /><br />Funny but recently got back into weed also. The days of my youth were fun and carefree (in the hindsight rose-colored glasses anyway).

				Broketown - yeah 2 days is normal. In fact it usually takes the better part of a week even on domestic orders.
