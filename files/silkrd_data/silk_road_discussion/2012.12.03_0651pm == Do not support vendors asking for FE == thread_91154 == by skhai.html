				I have had good all results with vendors, and i understand the need to FE as a new buyer (i wish they&#039;d implement something different tho) but more and more vendors, esp new vendors, are asking for FE. This is AGAINST SR policy, escrow is there for a reason. Plz support me in a boycott of vendors asking for FE (esp.after you&#039;ve ordered). Buyers are the ones who lose with this, so lets stick together. Thx for listening.

				People have the right to require FE.. as people have the right to NOT FE... It goes both ways.<br />Now.. when you&#039;re ordering a listing from a vendor.. and the listing reads as follows:<br /><br />Description<br /><br />This listing is for 10 10mg Percocet.<br /><br />Watson 932. 10/325.<br /><br />Used for &quot;mild-moderate&quot; pain. :)<br /><br />All prescription listings must be Finalized Early before shipment, thanks.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />And then we ask you to FE before we ship your parcel and then you rage on us and send us 4-6 messages talking shit about how we never said anything about FE anywhere on our profile or anything else? Well.. you really need to start reading vendor profiles..<br />and paying attention to transactions instead of just seeing the title to the listing and spamming &quot;Add to Cart&quot;..<br />This kind of stuff happens way too often. If you don&#039;t want to Finalize Early.. do not buy a listing that requires you to do so.<br /><br />We hope you have a blessed day.

				So you want to bring this to the forums when it was private? FINE. This new vendor ragged on me for &quot;going thru withdrawals&quot;-his insult from his judgmental mind (i can go to doctors if i want to be treated like an low life drug seeking addict) and other very unprofessional and hateful comments. He managed to remove the last negative review he got, but with an attitude like this, it won&#039;t be long, they&#039;ll be plenty more and he&#039;ll be gone, with your FE&#039;ed btc -all the more reason to not order from this pompous, fake &quot;blessed&quot; ass. Sorry to the 99.9% of other vendors I have dealt with, thank you.

				I personally don&#039;t ever FE for any product or vendor. It&#039;s not a boycott for me, I just refuse to work out of escrow. A vendor who requires FE from a buyer with good stats, when the order is domestic, is shady as shit in my book. No reason to require FE there.

				I really dislike FE as I&#039;ve been screwed on it once before, but what I hate the most is feedback left just saying FE. There is no need to leave feedback until you receive your product and that feedback score you leave is the only thing you have left since your out of escrow. The vendor can wait for feedback maybe not the money but it&#039;s the last thing you have protecting you.

Buyers stats are there for a purpose - Surely if a vendor can see good stats there is no case to require FE. I agree with the risk of newbie buyers but we were all there once. A few vendors list requirements for FE - i.e. under 5 transactions or spent less than $100 which I think is reasonable.<br />I recently had an order cancelled for no reason :-[

				I go to bed every night worrying that either sellers will get busted or decide its not profitable or too much messing about to sell on here. <br />You sound like your clearly an upstanding individual and im sure always hounour your obligations and act with integrity when buying on sr, but considering anyone with an android device can get on here in 5 minutes and its retailing highly addictive/desirable substances I think its vendors take the most shit. Keeping track and relying on ppl releasing funds in a timely manner must be murder.

				Just curious JahBUDS why the FE on prescriptions?&nbsp; I tripped across your page and was glad to see it wasn&#039;t required if you have good buyer stats, but then i saw the requirement on the listing.&nbsp; <br />Do you have more scammers on the pills?&nbsp; <br />Would that be reconsidered with really good buyer stats?<br />Like i said to start just curious.

There is literally not a single fucking reason to leave 5/5 fe unless you received your drugs. The point of FE is so the vendor can get their money early not to fucking get them better reviews for doing nothing. It drives me insane because if a real user has problems like I did you get a bunch of fucking idiots just leaving FE early feedback that doesn&#039;t allow other users to see that the vendor is scamming. Same thing happened to me with the TheFarmacy I left feedback warning others I contacted SR support and idiots kept pushing my feedback down that was warning others with nothing but bullshit to allow other users to get scammed. Zero reason to leave 5/5 FE unless your wanting to suck your vendors dick, save it for when you get your package.<br /><br />I understand the need for FE but not the feedback, many users got scammed because of dumbasses pushing my warning off the front page. It&#039;s for the benefit of the community not to leave FE, any vendor that requires FE is well established and isn&#039;t needing of the good feedback for sales. There is a minimum transaction requirement for FE to be possible for a good reason.

				I agree that having to FE is shitty, but you have to remember that people have created new accounts, bought an item, and never finalized, leaving the vendor&#039;s money tied up until they Auto Finalized. It&#039;s got its pro&#039;s and con&#039;s, but if you don&#039;t like it, there are plenty more vendors on the road.<br /><br />With that said, I&#039;m so glad I don&#039;t have to FE anymore.

By that time your feedback is so many pages behind nobody will see it or care.<br /><br /><br />Always better to work in escrow. Even for a trusted vendor. <br /><br />If you FE for your fav vendor and then something goes wrong, it&#039;s going to look very shady to him/her if you try to get a reship or some money back without the resolution center. Stay in escrow so that if your vendor makes an honest mistake, you can still work it out. If you try to talk to a vendor about an order that&#039;s already finalized, they&#039;re will likely either not give a shit or think you&#039;re trying to get a refund without hurting your stats.

				Thanks for the input everyone. We&#039;re definitely not a bad vendor.. and we&#039;re not here doing anyone wrong.<br />We hate Finalizing Early just as much as the next person.. but that is why it is ONLY on our Prescription listings.. nothing else.<br />We love Escrow and we have no problem staying in Escrow as long as the buyer has no problem Finalizing as soon as they get the product and check it out..<br />And checking it out does not take an additional 6-8 days.. so please.. just Finalize promptly upon receiving your parcel.. and a lot more<br />vendors would stop asking people to Finalize Early.<br />You have fiends and junkies out there whose main concern is to get that vendor&#039;s drugs.. then keep their money and get another vendor&#039;s drugs.. or get more drugs from that vendor and their money.. or a refund. Find another vendor.. rinse and repeat.<br />There are too many fuck ups out there compared to the ratio to good people.<br />We have to protect ourselves.. just as much as you have to protect yourselves..<br />That&#039;s another reason we REQUIRE PGP.. or NO DEAL.. but we still serve you guys that order without PGP.. Why?<br />Because we care. And we don&#039;t even ask them to Finalize Early... shocker, huh?<br /><br />Have a blessed day everyone. :)

				What are you ordering from them? We&#039;ve heard nothing bad about the vendor.. so give it a shot. :) We would never encourage anyone to FE..<br />but it&#039;s all up to the buyer. We do ask for FE&#039;s on prescription listings but that is it.<br />If it is a large quantity we can see a vendor asking to FE.. can&#039;t handle leaving those funds tied up for 2 weeks.. Especially if they are a <br />new vendor. :)<br /><br />Good luck and use your best judgement.<br /><br /><br />Have a blessed day.

				This thread annoys me and i have already ignored it for too long. I read it and was immeditatly annoyed, and then I noticed it is more of a isolated incident between Jah (who I would vouche for as a &quot;stand-up vendor) and a customer.<br /><br />Here is my issue (with out reading the whole thread; generally speaking)<br /><br />Customers do not want to FE. I understand it. I do not require FE on anything except digital goods (ebooks) and a snail mail no track option on the spore prints. Other then that - new - old - $35,000 spend or first purchase - I do not care. The escrow system is no doubt what makes this place magical.<br /><br />As a former buyer - I personally choose not to FE for an order. Not because of lack of trust, but because again of the escrow system making this place what it is......use the magic.<br /><br />With that said - BUYERS are a big part of the problem in making vendors require FE. Buyers wanna buy....then want their package over nighted to them......then they do not want to come and finalize!<br /><br />This is not just new buyers or buyers with little history. There are seasoned vets that still do this to me on the regular. <br /><br />So you want to me overnight you a package - but you do not want to finalize for 14 days? Yeah, that&#039;s cool. thanks<br /><br />I keep a personal list of any buyer that Auto-finalizes on me and i choose not to deal with them a 2nd time.<br /><br />My point (not that there is much of one other then a mad rant) is that buyers want to cry about FEing, and yet your co-buyers (if not even YOU) are the very cause!<br /><br />I know there are different situations and what not, but generally speaking..from what I have seen first hand. This would be my biggest motivation as a vendor to go fully FE.<br /><br />...but I NEVER will!&nbsp; :) <br /><br />P.S. - Case and point. <br /><br />High double digit orders open right with me right now (xx)<br />....and LOW single digit orders that remain in transit (x) - everything else has been delivered no less then 3&nbsp; days ago. shame shame&nbsp; :-X

				The truth is the truth which makes it easy to say. I planned most my comments on this thread regardless of if it turned to be about one vendor or another.<br /><br />Once I saw it was about Jah - it made my comments even easier to say.<br /><br />I have never purchased from Jah but I would tomorrow if I was looking to buy.

				Everyone and anyone has the right to FE, be it a vendor or a buyer. I require FE on the anonymous cards I sell because I don&#039;t keep them in stock for customer safety. I order them straight from the bank straight to the buyers address. Therefore I will not leave myself out of pocket while the order is waiting to be delivered.<br /><br />If buyers don&#039;t like FE they can always go to another vendor. Albeit FE is where 99% of scams originate. If you don&#039;t trust the vendor DON&#039;T DO IT!<br /><br />Dank

				I am strictly a buyer on this site.&nbsp; Been here around 6 months and spent a good deal of $$$.&nbsp; As stated earlier in this thread i can fully understand both sides of this dilemma.&nbsp; As i was catching up on the recent post it occurred to me while reading Shroomeisters posts to suggest a more detailed way of tracking the buyers finalization speed.&nbsp; I have no idea what the hang up is with other buyers.&nbsp; Every order i have placed which is over 40 i have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of the package.&nbsp; As soon as i retrieve the package the first thing i do is get online and finalize.&nbsp; The products i get don&#039;t require me to try them out before finalizing and leaving feedback.&nbsp; I could understand if you ordered a product that did require a test run that you may need some extra time to make sure it&#039;s legit.&nbsp; There is no way that that time should exceed another day or two max.&nbsp; I doubt it will happen, and i have no idea of what programming or code it would take, but it would be nice if our buyer stats could let the vendor know how quickly we finalize on average.&nbsp; That info in the hands of a vendor would really help them to know that this particular buyer isn&#039;t going to keep their money tied up long at all.&nbsp; That would allow you as a vendor to let me stay in escrow and you would know there was no risk of your money being held.&nbsp; Right now vendors can tell how many times a buyer lets it auto finalize, but it doesn&#039;t account for buyers that run it all the way out before finalization.&nbsp; It also doesn&#039;t account for buyers who finalize lightning fast.&nbsp; Just a thought

				I have been a buyer for well over a year now, and I think I only FE&#039;d once. I see reasons for doing once in awhile,<br />but it the buyers choice in the end. I personally never would FE for a number of reasons, but thats my own stance.<br /><br />To each their own, but the more people do it, the more people will get scammed. The more who wont do it and move<br />on to a trusted/know source, the better. IMO, you should never FE unless you know/trust the seller implicitly!

				I think at the end of the day the particular lesson here is for buyers:<br /><br />READ THE LISTINGS! top to bottom. For real.<br /><br />We had an adderall listing:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e9f05f3261<br /><br />Word for word - there it is - we didn&#039;t change or update it from the day it was written. ALL THOSE CAPS at the top and all that make it clear you need to order a min of 5x.<br /><br />Had a guy order 2x. Canceled his order and emailed him (it was so clear we shouldn&#039;t have even had to do that) but we did. Emailed him and said &quot;Sorry min is 5x as clearly stated in the listing&quot;<br /><br />He replies like 5 days later &quot;fuck you and your piss poor attitude... I dont wanna order shit from you anyway you condescending fuck!&quot;<br /><br />Im SURE that guy would have taken 17 days to auto finalize. How? Because we wrote him back and said &quot;Sorry for the confusion, please carry on.&quot;<br /><br />.....22 day ago...and he still has not even read it.<br /><br />Buyers: Read the listing top to bottom and it may not be a bad idea to read that vendors profile too. <br />

				Some sellers need some buyers to FE, its all about cash flow.&nbsp; Say a vendor lives half way across the world.&nbsp; Is it really right for for him to wait 2 weeks for his money?&nbsp; Sure if its only you its one thing, but when a vendor has $10000 in escrow its a big deal.&nbsp; If your domestic then there is NO reason not to use escrow.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying that FEing is fool proof, but escrow is the best system we have and there is flaws, if shipping times could increase maybe these would be eliminated but I don&#039;t see that happening as USPS can&#039;t even stay in business let alone improve shipping times.

				Another problem with FE is that once a buyer finalizes, all incentive for the vendor to get the product out the door is gone.&nbsp; They can take their sweet time and ship whenever they feel like it. FE&#039;ing removes the only thing protecting both sides and it drives me nuts.<br /><br />

				Im a vendor on SR and I only ask people to FE if they have less than 10 transactions. I also have a 100% rating on feedback. I htink I sellers feedback score should show alot about confidence in FEing, also as a vendor I ask FE on less than 10 items because sometimes we get new people who order one thing and never release funds. That can get very frustrating after 2-3 people do that in a row. If I see someone has more than 10 transactions I take it as they are a frequent buyer and can trust they will finalize when they receive their item.

Too many vendors who require FE have been either selective or total scammers.<br /><br />Forcing or allowing the site to get into a position where all vendors require FE to protect themselves from customers who lie about their package being seized isn&#039;t what this place was created for. Fair enough to have all buyers with less than 5 or 10 purchases or poor stats to FE, but when you force members with a flawless purchase record to FE, of course we think something fishy is going on. Nobody likes to FE, and in general vendors who stay within escrow are much more popular than those who don&#039;t.

I just also think (and I suspect you would agree) that if you have gotten over a certain level of &#039;newness&#039; (Much like the 35 sale limit for vendors) that you shouldn&#039;t be subject to mandatory FE just because you may not have ordered from that vendor before. If you have an established repor with a vendor thats a different story but even with established vendors you should be able to use escrow if they choose.<br /><br />There however needs to be some incentive thats mutually beneficial for vendors to stay in escrow, right now there isn&#039;t really. Not having to float XXXXXX amount of coin makes you a more liquid vendor and allows you to move more and profit more. So there is no incentive to use escrow unless you are a buyer.

				I swore to myself I would never ever FE, it seemed easy. However, I FE&#039;d the other day because the vendor was the only one sending the wanted goods to my country, and at a reasonable price. Sometimes these little fuckers just have the upper hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think that it&#039;s about time that SR prohibits the practice of asking to finalize early, rather than just dissuade it. The only time FE should be allowed is in the case of buyers with less than 5 successful transactions (in order to minimize the opportunity for buyer fraud), or buyers with an unusually high refund rate. For long time buyers with good stats, FE should be prohibited.<br /><br />The escrow system is there for a reason, and that reason is to prevent vendor scams. In my opinion, buyers who FE are asking for it. And in buying from vendors who require FE, you are also encouraging the practice.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said this time and time again: Vendors risk nothing by using the escrow system, while buyers risk everything by finalizing early. A vendor will get paid eventually, always. However when a buyer FE&#039;s they are at the mercy of the vendor. So the BTC are tied up for a while during shipping, so what? Does that justify the buyer taking all the risk?<br /><br />The escrow system fairly balances risk between the vendor and the buyer. This is why it should be the only method allowed in the majority of cases.

				As a fairly new member who has just reached stats that should hopefully mean I never have to FE again I totally agree with a lot of what has been said here against FE. <br /><br />The stress and insecurity caused by FE takes away from the reason that most of us came here in the first place, the fact is that the more we do it, the more commonplace and expected it will become. My final FE that I will ever do has been a huge pain in the arse even though it was with a big trustworthy vendor. I will gladly pay slightly more in future for a vendor that keeps things in escrow and gives me the security I need, otherwise we&#039;re just gambling, and there are far better places to do that.<br /><br />I can understand it for new buyers, although I wasn&#039;t asked to for my first 3 purchases which was an unexpected surprise, but there must be another way. <br /><br />I vow to never FE again, regardless of how tempting the offer is, security all the way. Although..if that one substance that no one else has that I suddenly desperately want requires it..hmm.I&#039;d like to say I wouldn&#039;t but I probably would, I guess I&#039;d order no more than I could stand to lose comfortably.<br /><br />As a side note, every time I thought I&#039;d have the stats to never have to FE again I&#039;d find that the next vendor required more to not be considered a &#039;new&#039; buyer, first 5, then 10, then 15! Perhaps a consensus on that would be a good starting place.

				Agreed with edar... WeirdScience made off with at least 25k due to people finalizing early...especially to a new vendor. He also faked his feedback, which is why i suggest you always look up a vendor here on these&nbsp; forums before placing an order with him. Feedback can be misleading, but these forums have always helped me out.

				There is another side to this.&nbsp; I used to do all escrow transactions and buyers would lie and say they never got the parcel, they would wait until the last second to finalize, or they would let SR autofinalize even though they had the stuff in their hands.&nbsp; The number of problems was driving my prices up, up, and away.&nbsp; I decided to go to FE only, and see how it goes.&nbsp; So far it is great and suddenly no lost parcels, no worries with people holding up my money, and no hassles.&nbsp; As a result, I have just started going through my listings and marking down products.&nbsp; Today I marked down these:<br /><br />clenbuterol/t3 weight loss stack<br />meridia appetite suppressant<br />testosterone enanthate 10ml/250mg by Unigen (human grade)<br /><br />Some were about 10%, some I marked down 35%.&nbsp; My point of telling you this is so you understand that nothing is free.&nbsp; If you want to stay in escrow, you have to pay for OTHER PEOPLE who act like idiots.&nbsp; When people scam and lie as a result of using the escrow system it drives prices up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep in mind I am near 100% feedback with (well) over 300 transactions.&nbsp; I am obviously superb at getting your shit past customs since I sell tons to Australia.&nbsp; But when I was doing escrow over and over again I would run into people who wanted free shit more than they wanted to keep their account.&nbsp; So they would scam me and just sign up for a new account.&nbsp; This is the biggest problem with escrow- anytime someone has dope in their hands that is worth more to them than their feedback, they would scam and get a new account.<br /><br />I understand staying in escrow and if that is what you want to do, deal only with vendors who support you.&nbsp; But keep in mind you will never get the best prices this way because that vendor has to pay for all the scams and there are tons and tons of scamming buyers here on SR.&nbsp; Sticking to an FE only business model has allowed me to cut prices and increase my revenue.&nbsp; If all goes well in another few weeks I will be cutting prices further!!!!<br />

				Flaxceed,<br /><br />I can totally understand your situation (I&#039;m also a vendor as well) especially as it relates to international orders as there is no real way to track that. In my case the recent vendor thats been a pain in my ass (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=97089.0) is domestic and in my case I paid a little more for a DCN package. A very small order too, not even $100.<br /><br />If it were a vendor with well over 300 orders and %100 and I had worked with them in the past then I might be ok with with it but if it&#039;s a vendor you don&#039;t have a rapport with then using escrow seems to me to be a good way of establishing trust for reputable buyers looking to check out someone elses product. I&#039;m not saying FE should be forbidden, but it shouldn&#039;t be something that vendors can require as a blanket rule.

We only currently require FE in international orders but in the New Year we&#039;ll be changing every order including domestic orders to FE. The reason being? Over $7,000 in escrow waiting for lazy buyers to finalise. Some of these orders are tracked deliveries and they&#039;ve been accepted yet the buyers can&#039;t be assed to log on to SR and click a button. <br />So whilst all of you buyers here bitch about vendors having to FE you only have yourselves as a collective to blame - it&#039;s a poor business model to allow huge sums of cash to be locked up for up to and over two weeks. <br />We pride ourselves on having the lowest UK prices and dispatching incredibly fast so it would be nice to see buyers also react so fast when it&#039;s their turn to do a little admin - sadly this isn&#039;t the case and it&#039;s not even the minority whom are slow to finalise, it&#039;s the overwhelming majority. <br />And if people don&#039;t want to buy from us in the New Year then it&#039;s a free market and they can choose to buy elsewhere because for all the complaints it is the buyer&#039;s choice to FE or simply not buy.

				It really annoys me to hear about buyers who are too lazy to Finalize their orders and even allow orders to Auto-Finalize on occasions! I can&#039;t fucking believe there are people that actually allow this to happen. It&#039;s a two way street. Buyers want their orders processed and shipped quickly, which is fair enough, however, when buyers receive their orders from a vendor, have the COURTESY to Finalize it straight away and release the coins to the vendor to enable them to keep their business turning over. Buyers not doing this are selfish, self centered assholes who should think of someone else other than themselves!&nbsp; :-[

				I can see both sides of the coin here. Both buyers and traders (prefer that to vendor) can be scammed. There are, and always will be (on this planet of joy) scamming pieces of shit. Beggars and looters, but now its plunder without stealing a boat and hoisting the &#039;Jolly Roger&#039;. the flag of pirates. But, at least being scammed in this virtual world is better than facing pirates or looters of ships who would wreck the boats, slit the throats of captain to cabin boy when they tried to swin to shore, and steal everything.<br /><br />So me being fucked by several vendors, in my early days (back in the day!) was better than other ways of being a victim.<br /><br />But, even now I get FE suggestions from some vendors. I could understand if my stats were 2 btc spends, 1 refund and 100% auto finalize ratings. My stats, are my business and the business of any trader dealing with me. I think they are enough to say to any trader, &#039;This guy can have escrow&#039;.&nbsp; Few traders would go out of escrow - that is to say, who would send out and say &#039;pay later&#039;. Well, actually, some have, one or two. They might send but I&#039;d buy, that would not be sent and SR gets their fee and I had my whatever and the trader gets his or her just deserves, the coin!<br /><br />So, before Christmas, I had a bro fall out of nowhere, needed some hash. So, being close to Christmas I said &#039;FFS&#039; - and other shit. The guy coins me, I grab a bit of simple hash, and the trader comes on with the FE. <br /><br />If it was just me, I&#039;d have told the trader to FE on my dick. Sorry to sound rude, I&#039;m English and we joke like this! <br /><br />But seriously, I made sure I got my hash WAY before the Christmas post rush - but done someone a favour. <br /><br />The guy has an account here - asshole forgot to bring some encrypted mini memory card. Anways, nothing underhand going on - I might buy for someone else but I think SR would welcome any member who maybe gets ten friends to buy through the one account. Some people have no clue about technology but they want hash and can always make an anon cash deposit to somewhere. The coin appears fairly quickly, and sometimes (like with one so called btc exchange) it vanishes! But, the person who done that, ought to have studied a little, done some research on how fake addys are all over net to lure unsuspecting customers into a coin scam.<br /><br />So, right now as it stands, with my stats, I&#039;m FE&nbsp; for someone else. Coin is fair but but nothing really. Depends how much coin you earn per week entirely. Argued for hours on the reasons why it was unwise. But, if someone asks you 100 times to do something, and they take the risk, well, you might FE for someone.<br /><br />Further issues arose when I PM&#039;d the trader, just to ask what day it was shipped. Also joked that if I was scammed, I deserved it!! A joke! Remember, us English guys can take more drugs than anyone else in the world. Its not just the &#039;big English dick&#039; talk thats true. Take people of all nations, give them a hamper of drugs each, the English will be sharing the rest and stepping over uncoincious persons of other nations.<br /><br />English guys joke a lot. We have a fucked up sense of humour sometimes, but never the nasty kind. Most English guys are like a happy breed of men, sooner be drinking and joking than sitting indoors. We do stay in sometimes&nbsp; ;D Actually, guys with children, sure they will stay in maybe even 4 or 5 nights a week. Which is cool as long as they do not use drugs around children. Not hash for sure. Beer? Thats ok. Cocaine around children? A big NO. Actually, using too much cocaine will turn you into a bore, a risk and someone whose car I&#039;d not be getting in for a ride. But a little snow, FFS, legalise that shit and take the billions of revenue! Plus, pure cocaine HCL, you snort 200mg of that and you could easily die! Yes, 200mg! But don&#039;t worry, if you bought UK street coke you could inject 5 kilos and have a 50/50 chance of 10mg of diazepam save you. <br /><br />Anways, were the fuck do you get a drop addy over Christmas? Answer, for me, a place were I needed to know when the shit landed. The trader, who even advertises a little bit more to those who FE, sent me a message stating no tracking number would be given to a customer. I actually know that! <br /><br />I read the rules here to the letter. <br /><br />I know, in case of any dispute, tracking numbers go to SR staff. But having gone FE, a tracking numbers is not much use - plus, all I wanted to know was what day was the thing sent. I think ANY customer deserves that be they a newbie or someone who has been around a bit here. <br /><br />So, I&#039;m actually a bit pissed off - even if the thing comes, what the fuck am I doing going FE? lol even though its not my coin and I got hash following me in the street, I got this FE blues shit!&nbsp; ;D I feel like some new customer who landed and found Tony76, who either set up tons of fake accounts or sent top class shit to everyone before using the old 420 sale we has here. The sale, in hindsight, it was always going to see someone scam.<br /><br />Also, I think that between different nationalities here we do have communication issues sometimes. With Americans, its easier to communicate than with Europeams, such as French, Portugese, German, Polish and so on. Europe is actually nations with their own language and the nuances of the langunges can make it difficult. Soa few times I have had difficulty there. You say one thing and someone from Poland might take it as something else! Eye to eye we would be cool but nobody is going eye to eye here for obvious reasons. This is not Topix, meeting with guys who have &#039;the best cocaine ever&#039;. lol. Avoid!!!!<br /><br />Anyways, I went FE at the time of the hack. So, I think a few traders will have wanted to shift any coin, just in case! For me, I spend a bit of coin, but traders, they may have a lot of&nbsp; coin. I know traders woould prefer to FE and know some people have trust with traders, but my trust is escrow! Without that, I feel like I&#039;m sending money to Tony76, who I know is still here somewhere!! You sly bastard! Send me my coin bro - level the Karma because, that coin you took will bite you in the ass. <br /><br />So, that&#039;s the Red, a bit annoyed by having to FE but also hungover and likely as not the shit will come - but traders will understand my niggly feeling of doubt and wondering if it may be the Christmas FE scam or even using the hack as an oppertunity to get FE. Some traders may well see enough coin in FE to tempt them. We can all be tempted, sure, but Red has always paid and on SR we have a good thing going on because I never worry about anything coming. It always comes! But, I always have escrow and to be honest, I want that escrow! No offence to any trader (some I&#039;d hug because I love honest people) but asking me to FE on just a bit of something, I cannot do that. If I asked for like a ton of cocaine, some might want FE or tracking ;D<br /><br />But I&#039;d sooner have a joint of hash than a ton of cocaine. Any man with a ton of cocaine could become an asshole very very quickly! Or jailed! Or shot and other naughty things.<br /><br />I have to say, I have never has a no show here ever apart from when I was a coin virgin going FE to scammers such as Tony76 (Canadian, took enough FE to retire!) and the Speed Doktor of Germany whose speed would have been a sleep rememdy for babies. Take 2 grams and fall asleep. Funny thing was, when I got some top notch speed off another German vendor, I realised I hated speed! Fucked me up for a week! Lucky my working buddies were understanding because half are the usual drug using English, using alcohol as a foundation for the nights merriment. <br /><br />Also, English vendors! Only gave less than 5/5 for a few vendors. The total scammers got 1/5 and advice to avoid like it was a list of STDs. Plus one English guy who sold pretty much everything - a regluar connected guy.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />&nbsp;I went for UK street coke, lol.&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D FFS! lo again!<br /><br />Buying coke in the UK - I avoid. Well, there is one English vendor here who I think has real coke! SR has delivered but in the street, pubs, clubs, almost anyone selling &#039;coke&#039; is selling maybe 10 - 20% if your lucky. Each area differs. <br /><br />Even a kilo of UK sourced coke, could be 10% easily. That is how bad its come, plus with RCs, I want a test for every coke on the road really, not because I even like it that much, but the guys I work with can bang an 8 ball of top coke! Fucking insane but freedom of choice and you build up a tolerance. <br /><br />So, to conclude, giving FE makes me feel like I&#039;d just given a blow job, drunk, and never even got paid! Not that Red does that. With the English, we can suck our own anyhow. <br /><br />So, to conclude, I dran lots of beer last night.<br /><br />I went FE during the little hack we had just before Christmas (hope not too many fell for that, but anyone new may have sadly been scammed)<br /><br />Amd the hash I got, I won&#039;t see it now till whenever - the guys off, works in some desert, so sending is like more than the hash!<br /><br />So, if it comes, I&#039;ll get rid of the evidence, to protect my bro!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Actually, sorted him something anyhow so we all had our own hash to splash! As one must!<br /><br />Anyways, Red is cool, if it comes and its good, I will message the trader, explain English humour (he thought I called him a scammer!) and give him 5/5 because, a misunderstanding is nothing really. A trader might make mistakes, many are hard working people and its a risk so I thank the honest ones always.<br /><br />So, happy new year to anyone here - and is it OK to sell vidoes of me sucking my own dick? I would say 50 btc, or so. I&#039;m not some cheap cocksucker. This is all a classy kind of thing. I got a cowboy outfit for Americans, leather for Germans, Fur for the Russians, and I&#039;m Kosher so any other Jews on here, I&#039;ll cut you a deal - 49.80 btc. <br /><br />Anyone interested, send free drugs to Red and I&#039;ll make a judgement on whether you deserve to see a video which will change your life because I also give a motivational speech in between what I&#039;m doing.<br /><br />I know Limitless loves this - and DPR, I&#039;ll do the vid for free for you. But on one condition, don&#039;t show your wife or whatever. People might faint. I could lie flat and fly a flag&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />And the nest person to reply gets a free 0.1 gram bag of fairy dust. Magic new RC makes you feel normal! Cheap at23 btc because it has NO side-effects and even childrne would never die. The recipe is secret. But this works 100%. Take a 0.1 gram dab, and 5 mins later the nromal feeling kicks in. You can eat, sleep and bang lots of men or women on it also. Goes great with ANY other drug. <br /><br />But this shit now!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				I think sometimes it&#039;s very obvious to see when vendors asking for FE are likely scammers.<br />However, there are good vendors, like frankmatthews who will offer a reship/refund if you let a significant amount of time pass after a no show you Fe&#039;d for.<br />It has been said but, the onus is truly on the buyer to make the decision to FE or not, and if you do FE do not leave feedback until you recieve/don&#039;t recieve.

				I am a newbie and just FE&#039;d on my first order. I almost placed an order with a supplier who is obviously running some kind of scam, but luckily got order cancelled first (close one there!!). The supplier I&#039;ve ordered from appears to have a very good rep, regularly asks for FE from newbies and has the product I want, where I want it (domestic). I appreciate the vendors concern of whoknowswho turning up and being trusted to run things to the planned way, ensuring no-one gets ripped off.......BUT, as a newbie, with very high morals and wouldn&#039;t dare trying to rip off a supplier, it is very...belittling to be asked to FE.<br />I was trying to think of a way around it, and, as I&#039;m giving my name and address to the vendor (that&#039;s me wide open to them), how about if I was to prove I was a highly reliable and honourable individual ? - in my case I could prove that I am a reliable, timely good payer by showing the vendor my ebay stats - 9 years of feedback stating that I am A: - an immediate payer and B: a great all round individual ;) - what think ye?

				As a newer vendor it&#039;s important to stick to my word from Day1 and never ask for anyone to FE. Vendors have the freedom to sell to those they feel have followed their security roles -- and the ability to cancel orders from buyers with terrible stats/histories. The vendors must protect themselves as well as the SR community by doing their due diligence for each and every order.

				Actually there have been several posts by others stating the same thing - re Aussies not helping themselves/ people posting bs about Aus Customs and now we have more strict FE rules.&nbsp; As stated to you in another post = not everyone has the same stats as you and to get the product I want its almost IMPOSSIBLE to not FE.<br /><br />Again, you said, you don&#039;t know what I am looking&nbsp; for or want SO THEREFORE&nbsp; you don&#039;t know shit about the restrictions on vendors I have to choose from.&nbsp; Again you have been on here for a looong time with good relationships as stated yourself in other posts.<br /><br />I have been doing a lot of research and it all points to the same thing - its making it harder for n00bs in Aus.&nbsp; There are many with the same feeling, clearly we are not going to agree on this topic and it seems you do post often to help and encourage so I don&#039;t wish to engage in a dispute with you over a situation that I and others are in, that your not.<br /><br />Re the moderators; ive read many things in regards to that, and thus just choose to consider the system &#039;the wild west&#039; and try to not post anything that could breach safety/ not that I would anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />

I just want others to do the right thing and aussies to be getting o/s products and prices.<br /><br />I still have hope that my two FE&#039;d products come through, vendor stats and comments were good, but if they don&#039;t I will take you up on your offer and again, thanks.

				As a buyer, if a vendor has a product i&#039;m interested in and requires FE i&#039;ll message them asking if they&#039;ll do the deal in escrow, if they say no i&#039;ll move on to someone else but at least that vendor knows they&#039;ve lost a sale because of their policy :)<br />If more buyers did this then vendors would see how much business they were losing and maybe rethink their policy :)<br />As a vendor I&#039;ve never required FE and I get a massive amount of new buyers with zero stats, and i very rarely get problems. Auto Finalizing is the biggest annoyance, something like 5% of all orders i get will auto finalize, I have 2 auto finalizing today.<br />While i don&#039;t require FE, I have had to introduce a deposit system for custom seed orders due to buyers requesting certain strains and then ignoring me once i get them in for them, almost every one had good stats and one was even a fellow vendor!

				What are the benefits for vendors on FE&#039;ing? <br />The way I see it, a deal isn&#039;t finalized till I&#039;ve got my product, so I won&#039;t FE. For anyone.<br />If a vendor asks for FE I&#039;ll move on and find one who doesn&#039;t ask for it.

				A lot of buyers play fair until they have dope in their hand that is worth more than their feedback profile is to them.&nbsp; In other words, they decide to lie and say they never got it and just ditch the buyer profile and start a new one.&nbsp; Too bad, but this is why I (and a lot of other smart vendors) are doing FE only now.&nbsp; We want to offer the lowest prices possible and the only way we can do this is to get rid of new scammers that will abandon their accounts, and older buyers who have a lot of transactions but selectively scam to lower their cost on their order.&nbsp; Sad but true!<br /><br />The answer is to make buyers pay for their account too- there is no other way to fix this problem.

It is one of&nbsp; DPR&#039;s guidelines as stated in the Buyers Guide (located in the Wiki) and also in DPR&#039;s &quot;A few words&quot; which is located at the top right hand side of the SR Homepage, he implores buyers to stay in Escrow until your package arrives and use the Resolution Center if it doesn&#039;t, to work out a solution. Escrow is not perfect and will hopefully be tweaked in the future to stop any chance of scammers taking money they don&#039;t deserve.

				You can&#039;t be serious flaxceed with this proposal for buyers to pay for their accounts?&nbsp; Why are you trying to reinvent the wheel here? SR has Escrow already, which will work fine if it&#039;s utilized. Instead of looking for a possible way of avoiding using Escrow, how about looking at way of implementing Escrow into your business model so it can be used to the benefit of all concerned.

				Only FE for those who have earned the privilege. <br /><br />There are plenty of vendors, who for whatever reason require people to FE, that are as amicable outside of escrow as inside it, and will always do their best to ensure their customers are taken care of and there are even rare circumstances that it can be beneficial to the buyer to show their vendor the respect of FE. <br /><br />We don&#039;t like our buyers to be unsatisfied and if the buyers in question feel we have reasonably made a mistake or their order doesn&#039;t arrive, we will always do our upmost to ensure they get what they purchased. Tony76 and duderugs type characters are certainly the acception here and not the rule. <br /><br />As a vendor the best advice I can give to someone, regardless of whether or not they use Escrow, is the golden rule of drug buying...

Just look on vendor southstar&#039;s page on SR or look for onestop&#039;s review thread in rumor mill and you&#039;ll see how things went down. He came back using some noob accounts to continue poking one drunk. <br /><br />Onestop demanded FE from all buyers. He didn&#039;t give two shits&nbsp; if they were good or bad, regulars or noobs. Called all his buyers junkies and shit that sucked his cock for their drugs. It&#039;s crazy. I almost ordered from him when he went back to using escrow. But he bugged out before I had a chance. His feedback is weird tho. All of them are 5/5 but he has 97%. That doesn&#039;t add up. Where&#039;s the 1/5 feedback that brought it down. SR ratings are so busted. <br /><br />This clown one drunk man says he got scammed but people keep reporting that they are getting their orders. Some FE feedback says they got their orders. Either one drunk is the only one to get scammed for being a punk bitch or he never ordered and is a shill for southstar. <br /><br />My money is on shill unless onestop hid the 1/5 feedback(s) which belonged to one drunk man.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />---------------------------------------------READ THIS BELOW FIRST-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Whatever. Man, you know making buyers pay for an account won&#039;t work. It will make buyer scammers, scam bigger. Just protect yourself with DCN. buyer pays shipping so there ain&#039;t no excuse for not using DCNs. <br /><br />What I think is needed is a 50% FE, 50% escrow. Like in movies when they go, &quot;half up front, then other half when the job is done.&quot; In fact, that can be done now. You make twin listings for the same gear. Like this:<br /><br />Let&#039;s say someone wants to buy 10 grams of bud but they ain&#039;t got the stats or you just don&#039;t want to bankroll that much and wait two weeks for some lazy punk to pay. So the twin listing would be like this:<br /><br />10 gram bud strain OG Kush (1/2 -50% upfront)<br />10 gram bug strain OG Kush (2/2 - 50% escrow)<br /><br />Then you say in each listing that a buyer must orders both or order will be cancelled or not shipped until buyer selects both orders. When 50% upfront is paid, bud ships. 50% escrow is due in 3 days after delivery or buyer will be blacklisted.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If the buyer fucks up and tries to scam and SR lets him get away with it, at least you cover your costs and you&#039;re liquid. <br /><br />That&#039;s the way you do it.

Yes, they may tell you this and tell you that, piss in your pocket or tell you things you want to hear but as you don&#039;t know where there from, where they live, any job they might have, hobbies or interests they are involved in, their past history or even their real name, you in essence literally don&#039;t know a thing about the vendor other than what they want you to believe and to draw any other conclusion from what I have posted other than you don&#039;t know the vendor from a bar of soap, seems crazy to me.&nbsp; ???

				What about if a vendor has loads of positive reviews and has proven to be trustworthy but a buyer has zero reputation on this site? I think in that case it would be plausible for the vendor to want to be paid upfront, but I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t do business outside of the escrow system.

Instead I am broke as fuck now and can not show my face around the investors that were involved in this. They aren&#039;t exactly the most kosher folks if you get my drift.

				Should I have to worry about Sammyace asking me to FE on a novelty ID? Also, looking into DetailedImages, seeing that he has good reviews, and that sammyace doesn&#039;t communicate clearly. The only problem I have with DI is that he does not work through the Road. Is this a red flag?

				When FE is mandatory, ive only had one problem and that was from a new vendor, however FE when you don&#039;t have to is a bad idea, i did it once, didn&#039;t get anything, i was told it was reshipped and still got nothing.

				this is a quite simple matter: whoever is least trustworthy needs to assume the risks.&nbsp; this can be either the buyer or the seller and is a simple matter of statistics. the more public the statistics the easier this becomes.<br /><br /><br />Love

				I will only FE for a small amount with an overseas vendor for the 1st time.&nbsp; After that I think continuing to ask for FE is a bit rich.<br /><br />That&#039;s my new rule.&nbsp; So far I have been luck though and gotten everything that I bought every time, including FE.&nbsp; Although I will admit, I didn&#039;t like FE&#039;ing.

				only solution: never FE!!!!<br /><br />if taken in possibility do your research and read the forums or simply search another seller.<br /><br />But here also a positive seller example: Frank Matthews always want FE, but i told him that i was scammed by this bitch phd1 and he said no problem (ALSO DUE TO MY STATS)<br /><br />But it is not an regular reaction......thumps up!!!!
