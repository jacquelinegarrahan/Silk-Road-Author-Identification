Iv never used bitinstant but they r lighting fast even with a delay..But i dunno why its not on SR&nbsp; yet, any help?

				How many confirmations does the blockchain show? Mine usually shows up around the 8-12th confirmation. I&#039;ve also waited as long 58 hours for it to show up so, don&#039;t panic yet.

As NOTspacecase said, it normally takes between 8-12 confirmations, it depends on how busy the network is at the time. Best of luck, hope this helps, and you get your coins soon :)

Happy spending to you, when they arrive&nbsp; :)

				Did you create a new address, or send it to an old one? When I make a new address it transfers pretty quick, usually within an hour, if I use an old address, first time was the last time, it took four days, and had to be done by our esteemed admin.

				Totally agree with TB, have noticed the difference, and now always create a new SR wallet before each load -- each time I&#039;ve done that the coins have showed up in an hour or less -- and as far as confirmations on the blockchain info, I&#039;ve seen the coins arrive with as few as 5 or 6 confirmations, but typically what the previous posters said has been my experience as well...peace

				There are delays. My funds usually show up in about an hour. This time it has been hours already and with many confirmations and nothing added to SR. SR needs to look into this, since it affects EVERYONE.

				I made a deposit and I didn&#039;t see it in my acct. till I woke up the next morning. It depends how you send it, plus the network has to verify it&#039;s real, etc etc.
