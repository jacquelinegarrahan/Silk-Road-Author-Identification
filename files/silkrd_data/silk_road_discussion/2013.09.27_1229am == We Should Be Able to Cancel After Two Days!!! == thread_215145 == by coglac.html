				This is the second time that I have in the recent past ordered from a vendor with a good reputation who has just not marked my order in transit for days, It fucks up my schedual when a vendor that says on their page they ship out every day will not ship or answer your messages and I cant cancel the order myself. <br />It sucks to have your money tied up because they are dropping the ball. <br />WHO IS WITH ME !

				To be honest this would probably just make vendors mark your item in transit before sending it out the product and likely storing your address somewhere. 4 days is actually good may prevent vendors who would develop such a habit from doing so. <br /><br />Most of my customers are good however and they understand my shipping days are Tuesday and Friday so you need to order 24 hours before a shipping day to get your order packaged in time to ship. Packaging orders is an extreme process people take for granted, when your vendor is taking the right security precautions. <br /><br />Having a storage area located 3 hours from where I live, combined with 3 layers that have to be washed and dried inbetween, added to another 3 hours of driving around dropping off each package in a different area = TIME CONSUMING. There are days where life prevents these steps from occuring, and I am sure you would rather wait then have your vendor cut corners and compromise your security. In the end if a package gets seized there will be some negative consequence on your end. I am sure you would rather wait the couple of days =). <br />

				wrong answer cogloc im a vendor and if i left my customers order sitting their for over 2 days , i would expect them to cancel. they have the ability to cancel an order if it is not marketed in transit, so go somewhere else. if vendors start marking orders in transit just to make it look good, the customers will know by the postmark dates. as long as its not a weekend it should be postmarked no more than 1 day from in transit, in case they did not make cutoff pick up times. and if that happens to my customers i message them. <br />this all goes down to the customer if they are not 100% happy with the transaction ,they will goo somewhere else. i dont know about other vendors but im not a 1 pill seller , their is a market foe it ,but im not your guy. some people will order 5 tabs and want overnight. someone will get it to them .you just need to search and you will find. that has a small niche .<br />i an a bulk vendor, lowest size is 50 tabs, but if you want it i can get any amt to you fast.I sell50 mg msir tabs<br />getting back to op you should be able to cancel your order any time till it is accepted by the vendor,and im a vendor.the only problem i see with that is someone ordering then canceling and asking for a lower price to re order?<br />but its a buyers market.

				vendors are taking longer and longer to ship, that is for sure, i have 2 orders that are still &quot;in transit&quot; with 7 and 8 days left to finalize. vendors used to ship quick, 10toes, hatter26, marlostanfield etc were GREAT, now they are all gone and buyers are left with crap. i have been a buyer for 9 months now and not sure im gonna be around much longer, i love SR and stuff but the vendors are killing me on timetables, waiting for 10 days or more to receive my stuff when paying for express and priority shipping is bullshit.

And they should tighten up the Priority Mail shipping to be shipped out in the allotted 4 days. Even if on the 4th day just before order is able to be cancelled.

				I just made my first order a week ago, last Friday night, and was surprised to still not receive it. I guess one week to a week and 1/2 seems to be a pretty average wait time. I do suspect that at least one of my orders was falsely marked In Transit a little early, but I understand where vendors are coming from. I&#039;m willing to wait the extra time if it means my package will be safer and stealthier.<br /><br />Must admit it does suck checking the mail every single day right when the mailman&#039;s driving off only to be disappointed. Anyway the system that DPR has in place for SR seems to be working pretty well, the rules are there for a reason and obviously they know what they&#039;re doing.

				It&#039;s four days now right? How is that not ok? If you buy from a vendor and it takes too long in your opinion for them to ship it, then just don&#039;t buy from that vendor in the future. <br /><br />Also quote from Diceman: &quot;Vendors&#039; stealth and security practices are paramount to keeping us out of jail.&nbsp; Give them a little time to do their job.&quot; THAT!

				I was not trying to suggest that a vendors job is easy and I would not have a problem with waiting four days to process as long as there was communication from the vendor, I ordered on two separate occasions from two separate vendors and right after their comments sections started flooding with people says your not reading my messages its been processing for three days no communication. I wouldnt even have had a problem if the vendor didnt read and respond to my messages but simply updating your profile to say that you are backed up would not take much time and effort and you would not have to get back to every person who messaged you. I think the three stage system would be great and you should be able to cancel any order that says awaiting attention.

				Yes, +1 for Hungry ghost&#039;s suggestion. The &#039;AWAITING ATTENTION&#039; stage would not only let people cancel without inconveniencing vendors but would also allow them to do so immediately (in most cases) if they realise they&#039;ve made an error (or, as I did a couple of days ago, decide that they want a listing for a different amount at a different price/weight ratio). Once the vendor has acknowledged the order, lock it until a few days after &#039;IN TRANSIT&#039; as, indeed, now.

				I&#039;m fairly new to the site, and have only had a few completed transactions.<br />I&#039;ve also had a couple transactions where the order was marked &quot;processing&quot; for a few days, and then cancelled by the vendor.<br />Not sure why that happens. I figure the vendor, for one reason or another, just wasn&#039;t comfortable doing business with me, thought I was a security risk or something? <br />But it kinda sucked checking back to the site every day wondering when it would be marked &quot;in transit&quot;, only to finally find it cancelled after 3-4 days.

If a vendor cancels before it goes late, the buyer can&#039;t leave a rating or feedback. And if the buyer rails about in the vendor&#039;s discussion page, it will probably be flagged and the buyer banned for a while from posting on any vendor&#039;s discussion page. <br /><br />Ever leave bad feedback? Or ask way too many questions in the pre or post order before market in transit phase? Not sure why else that might have happened to you. Stats good? It might also be that you live in an area that is blacklisted because buyers from certain areas tend to try to scam or blackmail vendors. So it becomes a &quot;throw the baby out with the bath water&quot; type thing. Or few rotten apples spoil the whole bunch. Or something like that.<br /><br />Did you ask the vendor why? Some might say if they are not too busy. <br /><br />I know that if we cancel an order, we generally say so in a PM sent subsequent the cancellation.

				You know now that I think about it, it would be kind of nice if we had maybe a 1-5 hour window where we could still cancel the order. Depending on when you order, in my experience it seems that most vendors don&#039;t even look at your order until at least a couple hours after you place it. It&#039;d be convenient if we had a little bit of time right after ordering to cancel if we change out minds about quantity or find something else we want. <br /><br />Then again I do see the problem this would pose if the vendor was really on point and started packaging the order right away, then we cancelled.

				In that 1 to 5 hour time frame, you could ask the vendor to cancel for you. It&#039;s hard to imagine a vendor who would want to hold onto an order from a buyer who just placed an order and and our or five wants to cancel it. The vendor risks bad feedback or a difficult transaction if they don&#039;t cancel. <br /><br />Only super busy vendors would be able to cancel an order at the buyer&#039;s request.

Not bad. As long as SR prevents a buyer from being able to leave feedback or a rating if they cancel during the AWAITING ATTENTION period, then it might work. <br /><br />Plus, SR should have it that if a buyer cancels in that phase, the vendor is notified with a link to the buyer so the vendor can message them if necessary. After 24 hours, that notification disappears.
