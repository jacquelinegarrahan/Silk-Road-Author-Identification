				Are you referring to accessing it by tor2web or some other clearnet proxy? There&#039;s not much to be done about that, those do operate through the darknet, they just proxy it to a clearweb address.<br /><br />As far as I know, SR and SR forums have no clearnet-facing pages or links.

				Sorry, so you&#039;re saying you&#039;re accessing http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion, directly from the browser you use for everything else?<br /><br />That just means that browser has tor enabled, and you&#039;re leaving a series of fingerprints tying all your clearnet activity to your darkweb activity. Not to mention wasting bandwidth torifying your clearnet traffic when you should use a separate browser (really, a separate computer, or booting off a dedicated USB), if you&#039;re serious about staying anonymous out here.

				Don&#039;t stress about it. I know that has a lot of people concerned. <br /><br />The folks accessing the forums from clearnet are not secure. You are secure because you are using tor. There is nothing stopping LE or anyone else from using tor. As long as you are using tor properly your identity can&#039;t can&#039;t really be traced back to your real identity. <br /><br />You are still safe and anonymous so don&#039;t worry. <br /><br />Kind of stupid though for people to access the deep web that way. Hope their firewall and AntiVirus is up to date. Lol&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This all started when me and a friend were discussing silk road. i did not even know he knew about silk road. so he says i dont buy anything from silk road but i go on the sr forum and look around all the time. so i said how do you connect to silk road forums and he says go on google on regular internet type in silk road forums and just click on it and he says he goes right to sr forums AND I SAID NO FUCKING WAY. he says he allways accesses sr forum this way says he does not post in the forum or buy anything from sr so he really doesnot care about his security i told him he was stupid. NO I DO NOT ACCESS SILK ROAD THIS WAY, LETS GET THAT STRAIGHT... yeah what zerik said

				Im sure we are talking about .to<br /><br />Would you access SR via free wifi at your local police station?<br /><br />By using a third party (like .to) you LOSE all of your anon - you are esentially walking around the inside of a local police station with drugs falling out your pocket.<br /><br />The reason SR and the forums are on Tor is to help keep you anon and secure.<br /><br />This one simply step (of using .to) throws all that out the window in 1 second - all in the name of you being lazy.<br /><br />How about you just photo copy your Photo ID and mail it along with all the drugs you have to DEA HQ.<br /><br />I can find the mailing address for you if you would like......<br /><br /><br />Moral = DO NOT USE .to!!!<br /><br />If you do not know what .to is - do not WORRY about it - its a HUGE compromise of your security!<br />

				Teach him how to use tor. It isn&#039;t that hard. Then he can post and be part of the community. Even if he never usees the SR market there is a lot to learn and do here on the forums.<br /><br />Remind him that the deep web is where hackers, identity thieves and scamers hang along with the cool stuff. Tell him he needs to learn how to be safe. <br /><br />Might be like talking to a wall but who knows you might get through.

				I do not suppose you could provide a screen could you? The only way I know of to get to the SR forums without using TOR would be the .to method, and that is the first result on google. The rest of the first page is just articles about the Road, except for one which just has a few of the guides copied found here (clearnet) vimeo.com/groups/silkroad/forum (clearnet). Is that the one you are referring to?

				Google crawls all clearnet sites.<br /><br />Since .to is a clearnet site, Google crawls it too.<br /><br />Google is showing the results found in the .to domain. The &quot;Silk Road Forums&quot; linked in the search results are to the .to site. Nuff said.<br /><br />Remember, &#039;anonymous&#039; is not the same as &#039;secret&#039;.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think there is much that can be done about it. It isn&#039;t like it was impossible to find in the first place. <br /><br />We can and should not like it. Even hate it. But there isn&#039;t any cause for alarm. <br /><br />You aren&#039;t any less safe than you were before.

				Its funny, I actually had a buddy who just discovered SR telling me about it the other day (I never mention to SR to a soul so it was pretty coincidental/ weird as he thinks I don&#039;t have a clue about it). Anyways from what he was saying he simply saw the forums pop up when he did a Google search about drugs. From there he discovered SR, so OP is definitely right the forums must be able to be accessed through the Clearnet, not a risk to any of us but I don&#039;t really like the fact it can be seen/ found through a simple Clearnet search but there&#039;s nothing we can do.

				This is the great march of civilisation, as google &amp; others catalog more of the deepweb via tools like .to formerly secret discussions become public &amp; our private secret little places get some (unwanted) light shed on them.<br /><br />Thus was order brought to the wild west - fortunately there&#039;s plenty of the deepweb left, and no doubt more being made every day so we can hopefully keep a few steps ahead of the search engines, laws &amp; other tools of civillisation<br /><br />

				I was curious so I tried to access the forums just through clear net. I could not get to SR unless I typed the address into the address bar through a non torified VPN. The only way it worked was to type the address into the bar.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t know how widespread the problem is. They must be using a .to site or a proxy. As near as I can tell you can&#039;t get there via just plain old Google.
