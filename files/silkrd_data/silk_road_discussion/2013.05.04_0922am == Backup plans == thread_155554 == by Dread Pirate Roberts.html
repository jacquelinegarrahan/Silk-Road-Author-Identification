It is not concerned with the health of drug users or the amount of crime they do or do not commit. It is a moral war fought basically &quot;because drugs are bad, mkay?&quot;, and for a bunch of different and often racist reasons if you look at the history. It&#039;s hardly even fought because of that anymore, but more because nobody has the political backbone to stand up against it until they are out of power. Besides, what are you going to do with all those people who live in places where the illegal drug trade was the only viable employment opportunity? They might stop fighting for crumbs between themselves and demand actual jobs and livelihoods.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about PR. Bringing down Silk Road would be amazing PR. Even though it is an utterly insignificant part of the drugs market (in economic terms), it&#039;s so hilariously brazen and is a huge fuck you to the drug war - which makes it a target.<br /><br />But as I said, an attack like this makes no sense from a PR perspective. From where I&#039;m standing, very few attacks will not conclude with the media asking &quot;But wait, aren&#039;t there still like thousands of people still buying drugs online?&quot; Short of catching DPR, there&#039;s not much they can make noise about that won&#039;t just make the site even more mainstream with even more users. <br /><br />I do fear though, that as more and more users start to use the site, making it obvious that it cannot be stopped and is going to change the war on drugs, and it actually starts harming the PR of law enforcement (instead of being largely a non-issue as it is now), things could get messy as LE desperately lashes out in attempts to scare people away from using the site. But I don&#039;t think that will happen until basically everybody knows about the site, and at that point we&#039;ve pretty much won. Or it will be the end of the postal system and the beginning of some shitty dystopia.<br /><br />Ha, that was meant to be like a 4 sentence response. <br /><br />Edit: Here&#039;s a promising update on just how mainstream silk road is getting. Promising if you think mainstream is a good thing, which I basically do.<br /><br />CLEARNET http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/internet-drug-dealing-survey CLEARNET<br /><br />&quot;But responses to the Global Drug Survey, an annual academic research poll with more than 7,000 UK respondents, suggest Silk Road is merely the most visible aspect of a much wider phenomenon.<br /><br />Just under a third of survey respondents had heard of the Silk Road marketplace, while 14% had set up an account on the site and browsed its wares. However, only 3% said they had themselves bought and used drugs from the site – though a similar number had taken drugs a friend had bought on Silk Road.<br /><br />Wider drug dealing online happens with less rigorous secrecy than the hi-tech (but hard to use) Silk Road. Instead, it relies on obscure coded listings hidden among job adverts, private sales and suspiciously cheap properties to let – &quot;flat for rent – £60 – ask for Charlie&quot;.&quot;

				Any Wiccans available on this site to cast a spell against the attacker(s)?<br /><br />Surely, the force can&#039;t be that strong with this/these attacker(s).<br /><br /><br />BTW, enough with the DPR scam talk. The conclusions some-a-y&#039;all come to... *shaking head*... think it through first and you&#039;ll soon see why it doesn&#039;t make sense. Don&#039;t think like an underachiever. Think about it from the perspective of someone who created something unique and special and the pride that goes along with gaining notoriety/infamy for having done so. Understand? Good. Now think about the other possibilities and the possible motivations behind the attack. <br /><br />And also look into how TOR works. <br /><br />SR will return. While Rome may have fallen in a day, it certainly wasn&#039;t built in one. So a little patience. It&#039;s not like taking down Amazon and the solution is to buy new servers. The fix involves first and foremost, maintaining anonymity. Anonymity for you and most importantly whomever DPR is/are. <br /><br />If you need to hit the streets to get some drugs, by all means. We&#039;ll all understand and wouldn&#039;t think less of any who did. Loyalty to Silk Road is merely that you plan to return to using it. And why wouldn&#039;t you? It&#039;s the best of the best. The original. <br /><br />So don&#039;t obsess about staying &quot;loyal&quot; per se. At the beginning and end of the day, SR is a business. Albeit, one with a supreme ideal. <br /><br />You only get street cred for claiming to stay &quot;loyal.&quot; None of us know or can see what you&#039;re actually doing. <br /><br />I bet that some of those who ardently hail staying loyal to SR are registered on Atlantis and/or BMR. Food for thought. But they too will be back to buying or selling on SR when it emerges triumphant.

				The government wouldn&#039;t publicize their DDoSing of a website because such attacks are illegal. Yes, I know that governments and law enforcement in general do all kinds of shitty and unethical things all the time but they don&#039;t blatantly come out and say &quot;yeah, fuck you, we did that&quot;.<br /><br />The attacker is most assuredly a competing black market site or just some guy who likes fucking with people and then laughing at them raging about it on the forums.

If it were DPR&#039;s intention to scam everyone he/she would have done so when the site was live, not allowing withdrawal of any funds at all so as users could continue depositing money and nothing could be withdrawn from the site.<br /><br />DPR would not be posting updates, nor would he/she attempt to get the site back up and running - he/she would simply abscond with the Bitcoin that is in user accounts and in escrow (and there is a phenomenal amount of BTC sitting in Silk Road wallets, with users being able to withdraw when the site is live.)<br /><br />If it were DPR&#039;s intention to abscond with user funds, it would have happened by now, most likely when Bitcoin were increasing in value to the $260 mark.<br /><br />This is not a scam by Silk Road&#039;s founder; this is an attempt at mitigating the effects of the DDOS and preserving the free market that we all enjoy here.<br /><br />Libertas

That way the attacker who is presumably a user(s)/vendor(s) here as well would be limited to DDosing only their url. Of course instructions would have to be given on how to generate a hash of one&#039;s username and password, and only people somewhat technically savvy would be able to get in...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how feasible this would be, but something has to be done until a real solution is in place.

				Possible technical solution:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Assign each users their own hidden service uri with a secret suffix: http://srgdfkgjdfdbfg.onion/bfuisdjngv<br />&nbsp;- Have a small reverse proxy monitor a portion of hidden services each, if the request does not contain the secret suffix then drop the connection<br />&nbsp;- If it does have the secret suffix then proxy it to the real server.<br /><br />I added the secret suffix idea because there are attacks that allow you to see addresses being used on hidden services. By requiring a secret suffix you prevent them from profiling these hidden services and attacking them.<br /><br />By randomly replacing servers, each time rearranging which one handles which service this would make timing attacks very difficult.<br /><br />If a url starts to be attacked just tell the proxy to stop listening to them. Users would still need a password as authentication in a url is problematic.<br /><br />The only issue becomes getting the secret to the users.<br /><br />If the road does not manage to get back up I am going to use a similar system to continue moving my wares.

				Lots of people asking &quot;if they can DDoS this url, why can&#039;t they do it to all?!&quot;, you guys are missing the point.<br /><br />The attack only has a finite number of resources, and it blocks up the servers ability to respond on that IP/hostname.<br /><br />As long as it isn&#039;t making the machine itself crash, opening more IP/hostnames means the attacker has to spread his resources much much thinner, and the likelihood of everyone getting online again is much more likely.<br /><br />It&#039;s an annoying solution, but it&#039;s a valid one nonetheless.

I doubt this is the case here, but a future concern for all of Tor.<br /><br />Its been interesting to me reading up on the Tor network and its vulnerabilities during this downtime, some good reading is available on their site, especially the tor design manual which goes into full detail but is very big!<br /><br />PS A good tip is use the &quot;Incognito Browsing&quot; option in your account settings.

				<br />PGP signature confirmed as valid. Thanks to DPR for providing these Plan B URLs! Keep in mind guys, SR has moved before now.<br /><br />--<br /><br />More PGP Club tutorial time! More PGP Club propaganda! :)<br /><br />More folks need to be verifying messages from SR Staff so Pine doesn&#039;t have the impression y&#039;all relying on a passing member of PGP Club such as SS to be your savior, it is simple:<br /><br />Step 1: Obtain PGP signature (for example DPR&#039;s public key has been posted on the forums several times recently and it&#039;s available on his SR user page). You need to do this *before* you think you might need to validate a sig. Sig veri is only intended to prove that the anonymous person you saw last week/month/year is the same person today, and that is all we need. <br /><br />Step 2: Copy paste the signed PGP message into your PGP software editor/clipboard and click the Verify button.<br /><br />Step 3: Check that the result is &quot;Valid&quot; or &quot;Good&quot;. Some PGP software will kick up a fuss and say &quot;Unknown&quot; if you haven&#039;t signed the public key (do so locally only), but it&#039;s just the software fucking with you. If you double check that you copy &amp; pasted correctly, and the signature still comes up as &quot;Bad&quot; each time, then either the OP with the signed message accidentally altered the message by accident or they are an imposter. If you get a Bad Signature, you demand a new Signature. If the OP with the signed message persistently refuses to acknowledge the result or they give a new signed message that is also Bad, then this is an imposter. An imposter is very unlikely to be able to produce a forged PGP signature but they are very likely to use social engineering (lol, don&#039;t worry you guys, no big deal blah blah blah).<br /><br />Very important tip: whenever a vendor or anybody tells you they are changing their PGP public key, and you&#039;re depending on this person in any way, then you had better request a signed PGP message containing a copy of the new public key. If you don&#039;t do this, signing and verification is a complete waste of time.<br /><br />--<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1087802#msg1087802">Quote from: ixor568 on May 04, 2013, 02:45 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is it just me, or does anyone else get a sketchy feeling from DPR&#039;s post?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1087211#msg1087211">Quote from: Rapid RX on May 04, 2013, 09:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Doesn&#039;t sound like DPR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1090195#msg1090195">Quote from: Mcrad on May 05, 2013, 03:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1089081#msg1089081">Quote from: skeezoo8586 on May 04, 2013, 09:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Bacon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>BACONNNN!!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1088251#msg1088251">Quote from: Everdred on May 04, 2013, 05:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5 pages of people talking about how &quot;sketchy&quot; this sounds without anyone actually verifying the signature.

Otherwise you&#039;ll upload your signature to a key server! This is the offline equivalent of updating every phone book directory in the world with legally binding evidence you know DPR&#039;s phone number. In addition this would reveal your IP address unless your copy of GPG is setup to route its communications via Tor).<br /><br />So, if you go to the keychain where the big list of public keys is on the GPA, you find the public key you want to sign, and then you right click and select Sign Locally. Then verify the signed PGP text again. It shall come up as &quot;Valid&quot;.<br /><br />Edit: fatoldsun&#039;s method shall work just as well as the above. Indeed using the command line or terminal is often preferable because it always works the same way over time and there&#039;s usually no difference between different operating systems.<br /><br />Edit 2: Some people are saying that the &quot;sign locally&quot; option isn&#039;t there in the GPA. It does exist, it just may be hidden away someplace, you&#039;ll have to hunt it down in the options somewhere. Alternatively use a less awkward piece of GPG software or use oldfatsun&#039;s method.<br /><br />Different PGP implementations handle these things differently. To be honest I think this web of trust concept has been implemented poorly, it&#039;s a complete cock up from an anonymity standpoint. The designers of PGP should have been thinking about how to make the difference between &quot;authentication use&quot; and &quot;anonymous use&quot; of PGP very clear to the user, because it is not obvious in the least.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1095444#msg1095444">Quote from: C20H25N3O on May 06, 2013, 09:50 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thank you very much pine!<br /><br />All of your posts are priceless<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1096818#msg1096818">Quote from: TurpenT on May 06, 2013, 06:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pine is a god/dess to this forum.

I don&#039;t know if they surveil keyservers, I&#039;m only thinking about what I would be doing in their position (it is a good thing you don&#039;t have pine as the adversary).<br /><br />There are two potential dangers to your anonymity.<br /><br />The signing is done by default with whatever your primary PGP private key is. If that happens to be your work related PGP key and you reuse passwords like many people, then it won&#039;t matter much if you anonymized your GPG client because if your primary PGP public key is already on a server, and you&#039;re uploading a signature (it happens in the background without you noticing it, there&#039;s no visual aid, which is a killer) to DPR&#039;s public key as part of some Web of Trust scheme, then you&#039;ve associated your real identity with DPR on clearnet where anybody could look you up. The entire point of WoT is that people are associating themselves with other people they know. I think you can see how that could turn into a problem for you right there.<br /><br />Now, hopefully your default public key server (every time you hear keyserver, think: PGP telephone directory) will bitch and moan and not let this happen if DPR&#039;s public key hasn&#039;t been posted on it, but why take that chance?<br /><br />--<br /><br />The second, more dangerous and more subtle threat is that you sign the public key without thinking much about it. Then your computer connects to the internet to your default keyserver and then attempts to upload your signature. Now, whether that works or not is irrelevant because your *real IP address* is what is connecting to the keyserver with a sig from you on DPR&#039;s public key. Again, a smart LEO would monitor the keyservers for any evidence of these things to pick people off. You can prevent this by torifying your GPG client. However you shouldn&#039;t be using WoT in the first place.<br /><br />--<br /><br />In short, do not sign anything unless it is local. <br /><br />Keyservers can be a good idea. In fact they are very good idea. Just don&#039;t jinx yourself by accidentally falling into some dumb WoT scheme you never wanted to be involved in in the first place. As you can tell, it&#039;s a minefield for your anonymity. This is because GPG and PGP implementations have shitty designs when it comes to anonymity. Incredibly, some cypherpunks overlooked the use case in which people wanted both anonymity and encryption at the same time. This is because much like Mark Zuckerberg, they became featurewhores and also because they imagined literally everybody would be using PGP because they thought people were going to be tech savvy in the future. So those cipherpunks deserve nothing but our pity.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.msg1097710#msg1097710">Quote from: Mcrad on May 06, 2013, 11:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i havent done this yet.<br /><br /><br />so i import DPR&#039;s public key and sign it with my public key. then post it here?<br /><br /><br />thanks pine&lt;3<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sign it locally only! And you don&#039;t post anything here at all. And you can&#039;t possibly sign a public key with your public key, but that&#039;s a different subject. <br /><br />The idea was (IFF) you&#039;re using the GPA that comes with GPG4WIN then you sign the public key locally*, then you copy paste DPR&#039;s original message into the GPA Clipboard and click on &quot;Verify&quot;. Then GPG will tell you whether the message is really from DPR or not. Note: This only really makes sense if you already had DPR&#039;s public key *before* the signed message was posted.<br /><br />Alternatively open the command line or terminal and do it oldfatsun&#039;s way, which will be better for lots of people.<br /><br />* Some people are saying local signing is not right there in the context menu when you right click on the list of public keys. I thought it was there as an option, but if not then root around in the options for the GPA and you&#039;re sure to find it somewhere.

In order for it to show up, you have to go to Edit -&gt; Preferences and then click on &quot;Use Advance Mode&quot; (it&#039;s the first checkbox). When it&#039;s checked, click Apply, or Ok, and now when you right click on a key, it&#039;ll give the option to sign it locally.<br /><br />I may have overcomplicated it with this next paragraph, so if you only have one public key, feel free to skip the next paragraph of this post.<br /><br />Before you do, you should check on the bottom of the main GPA window at the status bar. It will tell you what your Selected default key is. If you want to change it, go back to Edit -&gt; Preferences and select which key you want to be your default key, and press OK. Then go back to the key you want to sign and it&#039;ll be signed with the key you have selected as default. Always look at the bottom to see which key you&#039;re about to sign it with. Even though you&#039;re signing locally, it&#039;s a good habit to get into separating different aspects of your life.<br /><br />

				Whats up people,<br /><br />I am looking for someone who knows how to write the code for another anonymous website. I have a dedicated server that has the ability to run TOR services on it. I am an experienced IT engineer and know how to run operations such as these completely anonymously. However, my knowledge of website coding is limited and integrating Bitcoin is a bit too technical for me to figure out in such a short space of time.<br /><br />Basically the software will need to run just as SR did with a few variations for security reasons. The coder and myself will never know who the other person is to keep our own anonymity safe.<br /><br />Anyone who could do this, inbox me and we can start discussing. PLEASE, only people really capable of doing this, I don&#039;t want time-wasters.<br /><br />Why should you do this?<br />- You will be 100% protected because I will not know who you are, therefore, if I do get caught, you won&#039;t. You run NO risk<br />- This planet needs a place like SR!!!<br />- For the love of the SR community!!!<br /><br />Cheers

He only has himself to blame. We all knew this could (and would) happen sooner or later, and it&#039;s not as if DPR has taken his money... if he really doesn&#039;t see how it&#039;s his own fault then&nbsp; instead of being pissed off at DPR he should blame the DEA.

				Everybody that has been around for a while should know backup plans were never going to be carried out as *planned*<br /><br />Anyway, just logged on to ask: IS MAIN SITE UP? IS IT SAFE TO LOG IN?<br />ARE BACKUP BITCOIN ADDRESSE WITHDRAWLS WORKING??<br /><br />I HOPE dpr wasn&#039;t operating as a total one man band, otherwise who else is there to push the red emergency button?

				This poses an interesting dilemma, let&#039;s say before Silk Road went down the Source Code in its entirety would get leaked and ( for the sake of argument ) it had no visible vulnerabilities. Would this have had any effect at all on Silk Road in terms of copycat Sites gaining any momentum? I would suspect not, the strength in Silk Road was with the Leadership, Support and Community. Now the Code itself for the web page had numerous flaws in terms of functionality and how effective it was and I highly suspect no copycat site would have been able to improve much upon it without creating something from scratch.<br /><br />So realistically speaking either there is a backup which is worked upon in the background by people close to DPR or it was handled like Atlantis, ie. no trace of the Source Code was intended to be released at all after shutdown. I would be slightly surprised if it turns out it&#039;s actually the second option as that would indicate DPR did not feel the strength of the site was what I mentioned earlier.

				It seems like this thread is sticked to make fun out of us.. The big joke is stickied &quot;&quot;THE back up plan&quot;&quot; Ha ha ha ...<br /><br />I still have the urge to think all this was 1 april Fool&#039;s day.. DPR the big clown making a big joke about him publicly advertising SR with his real personal name.. <br /><br /><br />Sorry, no respect for this guy.. another reason i show no respect is because he wanted to ban me for doing Out of escrow deals. After having a discussion by rationally explaining why those specific out of escrow deals would only benefit him too and no one would lose, he kept insisting that the escrow was such a good system and that every coin had to go through it, and it was my &#039;last warning&#039;<br /><br />Well thanks for forcing me to put all my coins into your oh-so-safe-and-well escrow, you clown!<br /><br />Third reason why i don&#039;t have much respect for this guy, is that he ordered a hire for murder, while he prohibited the sale of hitmen on his site. So you don&#039;t let anyone else hire hitmen, but you do use one yourself ? Is this libertism ??? I call it being a funny clown.<br /><br />&#039;The most mysterious character on the internet&#039; well apparently not so mysterious.. I think anyone around him knowing of SR could suspect he could be DPR, with all the hints on his youtube/linkedln/facebook and what not.<br /><br />It almost makes it seem like he did it all for the fame, almost wanting to get caught.<br /><br />Running SR and still living in the USA ?? What the fuck ?? You should have been somewhere in the bahama&#039;s taking care of REALLY securing sr, with a back up plan, not sitting in the USA, indirectly bragging about SR on your facebook profile, and giving the SR community the illusion that you have created a back up plan and SR is very safe.<br /><br />Doing jail time is not a fun thing, and you don&#039;t deserve being in jail for a long time, but you do deserve a good lesson clown boy !!! <br /><br />The day you come out of jail i will Track you down to demand my 250.000 USD you clown ! Of that were 1000 coins unhedged, so expect to pay the profit too if the coins have risen in value !

Have read something about another big vendor that was in contact with DPR. <br /><br />DPR told him that the bitcoin wallets of SR are spyied by LE and because of that he stores all the money, until a new safe bitcoin-wallet is ready.<br /><br />Maybe thats the reason why a lot of BIG Vendors are collecting that much money in their SR-Wallets
