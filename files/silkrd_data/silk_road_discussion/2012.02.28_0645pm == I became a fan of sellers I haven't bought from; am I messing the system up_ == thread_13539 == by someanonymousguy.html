				So I was browsing the forums when I read about this new stealth system. I&#039;m a new buyer, I just bought two items in the last week, waiting on them now. I went in and became a fan of sellers I have not bought from, but would like to buy from in the near future, in case they decide to start selling stealthily. Am I stopping their regular customers from now getting a list on the fan page?

				I&#039;m pretty sure that would defeat the purpose of the system. Any customer should be able to get on a sellers favorite list. I have added a couple sellers to my list that I have not bought from yet too just in case they go stealth.

				at this point the biggest benefit to becoming a fan is if a seller decides to go into stealth mode.&nbsp; Their listings won&#039;t show up in the regular sections, and you can only get to their page by using the direct URL (which you have if you are a fan).<br /><br />I have been bugging SR to open it up a bit and let us vendors be able to do more with the Fan option, like fans-only sales and stuff like that.&nbsp; I would be all over that :)

It would be a shame if they came back and I didn&#039;t know because they were stealth
