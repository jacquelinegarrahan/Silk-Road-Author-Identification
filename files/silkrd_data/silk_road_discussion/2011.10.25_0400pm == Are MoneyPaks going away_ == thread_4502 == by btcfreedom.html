				I live on the east coast and it seems odd this is happening. I can&#039;t find a MoneyPak!<br /><br />smaller cities ( i haven&#039;t been into larger cities yet to try ) or being RECALLED (WUT) as a Walgreen&#039;s <br /><br />employee told me. Too many calls in a row to Rite Aid and CVS with &quot;we don&#039;t have them anymore as of two <br /><br />weeks ago&quot; just bothers me.<br /><br />Not holding him to his word....but don&#039;t you all find this fishy?<br /><br />Please share if this is happening in your town. I would hate to see this as an LE activity.<br /><br />regards

				Located in the Midwest, local Walmart told me they weren&#039;t carrying them anymore, but I found them at the local Walgreens last night.<br /><br />

				I certainly hope not as I just got a card that will take the moneypak refills. I will check on this and let you know. I live in the Western US.

				I have a question about MoneyPaks. What&#039;s the difference between them and say a $50 Visa gift card that you can buy just about anywhere?

				Because with money packs, you can load them on&nbsp; to a prepaid greendot visa card. they are very handy. the 50 dollar visa card can only be used once and can only be used with someone that takes credit cards....<br /><br />This will be a shame if they get rid of them. I find them handy has hell...

				The Rite Aid near me still sold them a few days ago. That will be a major inconvenience if they go away. Are they disappearing completely or just from certain stores?

				Man, i really hope they don&#039;t go away! I bought one at walmart on friday and they had 5-6 cards in the display. If they do go away, what would be the best way to get btc? :S

				Hey guys, i did a little digging on moneypak official site. If you goto the site you can search for local stores that carry MoneyPaks.<br /><br />I did a search for my home town and i got about 10 stores, from CVS&#039;s to Sunoco&#039;s but no walmart! So i&#039;m thinking the site is up to date on what stores currently have the cards?<br />If so i&#039;m not so worried as i have many options to try.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t find a moneypak, goto their site and find a different store! I&#039;de like to see what happens with other people. I won&#039;t be buying a moneypak for a couple weeks, as i&#039;m short on cash this month.

				I saw MoneyPaks a week ago, so they haven&#039;t gone away where I&#039;m from.<br /><br />I thought it was interesting that I don&#039;t see them at my local Wal-Marts, Targets, and other huge corporations. I&#039;ve only seen them at gas stations and CVS. I&#039;m not sure why this is.

				I called several walgreen&#039;s and CVS stores that were listed on the moneypak site and they said they were not carrying them anymore. There are a lot of gas stations and convenience stores that do still have them however.

				ok so I looked into this situation... CVS has not gotten any in the last few weeks, reason from store manager &quot;we&#039;ve got them on order but we havn&#039;t gotten any in four weeks because their listed as out of stock.&quot;<br /><br />I called Moneypak.&nbsp; They said that my area &quot;must just be out because we&#039;re still shipping them&quot; and that I could swipe my card to do a reload at any of the registers of resalers without a moneypak for 4.95.&nbsp; hummm.<br /><br />Someone lied, thats for sure...&nbsp; straight up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly I think Moneypak is up to something.. why would the CVS manager give a shit enough to make some crazy story up.. actually the manager seemed pretty frustrated about it because so many people have been asking him for them and they cant get any.&nbsp; The guy from Moneypak just sounded like he was knowingly lying.. i can usually tell when someone is lying outright and this dude had my bullshit detector sounding off full tilt boogie.<br /><br />Paperchasing<br />

				I agree, this is all very strange. There&#039;s no way that ALL the big chain stores just happened to run out of moneypak at the same time... And seeing how almost all bitcoins are bought with moneypak, it seems like they would definately be targeted by the authorities.<br /><br />Another example is get-bitcoin. They stopped taking moneypak on the 20&#039;th, almost the exact time that walmart ect.. started &quot;running out&quot;. The reason they give is that they&#039;re working on a new system to verify moneypak numbers, for faster service.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really sure what to think about this
