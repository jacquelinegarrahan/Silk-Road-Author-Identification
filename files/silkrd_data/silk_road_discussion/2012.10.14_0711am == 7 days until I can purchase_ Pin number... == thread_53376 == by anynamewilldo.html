				So did I skip a step signing up?&nbsp; I want to order but I never created a pin number.<br /><br />I did a search, only relevant thread that resulted was saying &quot;You have to wait 7<br />days to purchase now.&quot;<br /><br />Do I just need to guess incorrect pin numbers until it locks me out and my 7 day<br />wait begins or am I missing something? <br /><br />I do apologize for my first post being such a piece of shit question, however, I<br />promise to redeem myself once I overcome the nuances of working within SR.<br /><br />Sorry/thanks.

				you should have set two passwords when you registered, the pin is that second password<br /><br />if you registered like 9 months ago (dont know how long exactly) then there werent pins at that time<br /><br />after trying a certain number of times the acct will lock like you mention and youll receive a message from SR about how to reset<br /><br />sorry theres nothing else you can do really, so you may have to wait a week

				What the hell... Now I got the message in my inbox from SR talking about my Pin reset.<br />However, when I click &quot;read&quot; it just refreshes my inbox page.&nbsp; I checked other messages<br />in my inbox and it&#039;s working fine, just not for the one I need to read!&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone ever have this happen?&nbsp; Do I need to message a forum administrator or something?

				someone else reported an issue opening the pin message too, i dont know but there might be a way you cant open it until the 7 days have passed<br /><br />its not a forum issue though, so dont message the forum mods about it - if after 7 days you still cant access it the best thing to do would be use the link on the bottom right of SR which says &quot;contact us&quot; to message SR support

				Click on SR support I think, and it will let you open it. Just try all of the links on that message in your inbox. If that makes sense....

				Just make a new account. If you haven&#039;t purchased anything before then you don&#039;t have any buyer stats to worry about losing... better than waiting 7 days IMO<br />.Hades

				OP didn&#039;t mention if he had funded the account or not. If so, then yea (s)he&#039;ll have to wait the week and see what can be done. Otherwise, new account hoooo!!!!! :D lol<br />.Hades.

				i guess you are right, but i am not aware of any time you need to enter the PIN unless trying to place an order or send funds somewhere else, so i kinda just assumed their money is already locked up

				Yeah, it&#039;s true..&nbsp; I have my account with BTC in it.&nbsp; It allowed me to add BTC to my account<br />without PIN, but then required it to place the order.&nbsp; (Not complaining, if anyone wants to put<br />BTC in my account, do not make it any harder for them to do so!!)&nbsp; But yeah, thanks for the<br />help guys.&nbsp; A few days wait won&#039;t kill me.

Also check the forums and see if there are any questions you can help users with.

				Actually the wait time is now 3 days.&nbsp; I was contacted and they said I had 2 more days to wait.&nbsp; That was now 3 days ago.<br />I know it was my fault for forgetting the PIN in the first place, however, I have money sitting there waiting to be used and<br />I did my time!!&nbsp; I put my money in, I&#039;d love to be able to order...&nbsp; How long does SR Support usually take?&nbsp;
