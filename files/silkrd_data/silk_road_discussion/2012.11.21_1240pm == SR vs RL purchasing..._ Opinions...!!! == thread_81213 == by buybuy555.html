				hey fellow roadsters...<br /><br />last night i had to go and buy some smoke locally for the first time in months, because of the SR blackout last week... I paid Â£30 for a quarter of what i was told was caramel hash, and i thought, right, its hash so at least i will get stoned as i havent seen or heard of any gack floating about, boy was i wrong lol it tasted lovely, but lovely dont get stoned guys :(<br /><br />i guess what im trying to say is, because of this, iv realised how much respect i have for SR and the community, and if i had of went and tryed to purchase this on SR i would have found out threw the forum that the smoke was pish, or if i did take a gamble onit, my funds would have been in escrow and me and the vendor could of sorted something out, cos lets face it in RL u only ask for your money back if u have known your dealer for yrs or are a regular customer...&nbsp; :(<br /><br />so thank you DPR and all the SR team for what u you have accomplished here, its little things that happen in RL that really opens your eyes to how great SR actually is...&nbsp; ;D

				I can&#039;t say enough how much better purchasing something on SR is than buying off the street.&nbsp; Especially for pharmaceuticals which is the majority of what I purchase.&nbsp; Much love and respect to the SR staff!

				I agree...but I disagree to some extent.&nbsp; In my area, it is sometimes much easier to acquire quality goods for a more reasonable price than on SR.&nbsp; Mainly, cannabis, which being very close to a major US metropolitan area, makes the cannabis market abundant.&nbsp; I have only bought weed on SR if there was only dirt going around my area, which happens for maybe 2 weeks out of a year.<br /><br />That being said, SR is a godsend for some harder to come buy items, like LSD and pills.&nbsp; Pills, unlike weed, are controlled nationally, so having a RL hookup for a good quantity of diverted pills is much rarer than having a RL hookup for decent weed.&nbsp; I *love* SR for buying pills and LSD.&nbsp; LSD vanished from our area about 10 years ago, and then 2 years ago, enter SR, and now there is always LSD going around my area.&nbsp;
