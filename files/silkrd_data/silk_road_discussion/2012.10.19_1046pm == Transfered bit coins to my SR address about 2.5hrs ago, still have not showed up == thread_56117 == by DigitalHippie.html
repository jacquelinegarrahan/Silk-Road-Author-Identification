				I bought bitcoins a few hours ago then I transferred them to my Silkroad bitcoin address. It&#039;s been almost 3 hours and it&#039;s still not showing up under my account balance on silk road. I checked my address on block chain and it shows where the transaction was made, and I think it said it was completed, however my SR balance does not reflect it.

				well that makes me feel better..<br /><br />So I transferred BTC to my SR address yesterday.&nbsp; It&#039;s been nearly 24 hours, over 80 confirmations, and still no BTC showing up, even tho blockchain and blockexplorer show the transfer is complete.<br /><br />Something is wrong with silk road.

				I was having trouble today as well. I purchased bitcoins at around 2:30PM, they didn&#039;t show up in my instwallet until 5:30PM (and then weren&#039;t spendable until 6:15PM) and didn&#039;t show up on SR until 7:55PM. I&#039;m pretty annoyed but I guess its happening to a lot of people.
