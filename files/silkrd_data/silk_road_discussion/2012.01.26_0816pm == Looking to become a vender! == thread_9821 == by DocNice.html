				&nbsp;First let me say how honored I am that someone has built this site and made the choice to be FREE!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Ok I have spent days reading the forums, and researching Bitcoin...and I am fairly sure I have this thing mostly figured out.....however I need to know:<br /><br />&nbsp;What is the best way to cash out???<br /><br />&nbsp;I am in the USA and in order to serve my new customers I need to know my turnaround times so I know what I can and can&#039;t commit too! <br /><br />&nbsp;So I would be very grateful if someone would lend a hand and help me understand the most efficient way of turning Bitcoin into $$$ in the USA!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;Oh and please allow me to introduce myself.....I am DocNice:) I look forward to serving your high end cannabis needs! We grow everything ourselves to ensure high quality organic standards and to keep prices very competitive!! I have established a network of growers I personally trained and oversee to ensure I can keep up with high demand without losing quality.<br /><br />&nbsp;My first priority is your satisfaction so I am going to hold off creating my vender account&nbsp; for a few more days so that I can learn a little more!! I don&#039;t want to offend anyone with newbie mistakes!!<br /><br />&nbsp;Is there in fact a venders guide? <br /><br />Thanx much:)<br /><br />~Doc<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a vendor but I had been wondering about the Bitcoin&gt;Cash exchange myself.&nbsp; There are few exchanges on the web but I don&#039;t know if this is the common way or is there is something more efficient.<br /><br />get-bitcoin.com - I have used them to turn my cash into coins several times and always had a good experience.&nbsp; However I have never used them to &quot;cash out&quot; but they do gurantee a 24 turnaround and if I remember correctly the fee percentage to do it is lower than what they charge to turn cash into bitcoins.<br /><br />This might be a terrible idea, maybe a seller can enlighten us?&nbsp; &nbsp;But to me get-bitcoin.com are honest people and not a bad way to go.

				there are tons of ways to turn bitcoin into cash. Mostly, the cost depends on how anonymous you want to be. If you dont care about anonymity, then transfer your money on mt. gox to your dwolla account then to your bank account, this only costs .25 cents plus mt. gox fees which are about 1/2 percent.<br /><br />Or go thru Liberty reserve and you could be spending between 7-10 percent. But, you have many more options and have the opportunity of being somewhat anonymous.

				Yes, Silk Road has a seller&#039;s guide:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/sellers_guide<br /><br />You&#039;ll need $150 worth of bitcoins to buy a vendor/seller account. If you&#039;re selling physical goods you&#039;ll also need a vacuum sealer, gloves, a scale, and printed labels. Here&#039;s a thread about what postal inspectors look for:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0<br /><br />This comment list things that set off red flags for a package:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1687.msg14234#msg14234<br /><br />You may also want to read some of this page, the Art of Smuggling (but it&#039;s currently down):<br />http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/II/smuggle.html<br /><br />Also look in the shipping forum:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=6.0<br /><br />You may even want to buy something from a top vendor to see how they package things. However, NEVER USE A SELLER ACCOUNT TO BUY ANYTHING, and never start selling from an account that has been used to buy before.<br /><br />It&#039;s also more convenient for buyers when vendors include the cost of shipping and SR fees in the listed price. You can read about the latest fees here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.0<br /><br />List your prices in USD (US dollars).<br /><br />I also suggest you become familiar with PGP/GPG, as many people will want to encrypt their addresses before they will buy from you. Read this:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9441.msg86924#msg86924<br /><br />And post your public key on your user profile on SR.<br /><br />You may also want to read this helpful guide written by v01d:<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/paste/show.php?id=fcc21f55e8225274<br /><br />If SR ever goes down, you&#039;ll probably want an email address at tormail.net or elsewhere so people can contact you. Another option is TorPM:<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/pm/<br /><br />There are also other ways to communicate offsite like SILC, TorChat, XMPP, etc. Research those on the forums if you want.<br /><br />You can check if SR is down here: (or maybe on these forums)<br />http://warweedoeg6lfyoz.onion/updown/<br /><br />And if you take a picture of your product to upload, make sure to strip all metadata from the image first. (AFAIK this can be done as simply as taking a screenshot of the image and then cropping it and resaving it, or saving it as a BMP and then again as a JPG).<br /><br />You&#039;ll probably want to start by only shipping packages within your home country. Don&#039;t send packages from your residence or at a counter inside a post office. Start small. Regarding what to put as the return address, look around the forums for suggestions.<br /><br />Introduce yourself on the forums and be active there. Sending samples to established forum members is one way to establish positive feedback.<br /><br />As for cashing out (turning bitcoin back into USD), there are BTC vendors on SR who will pay money for bitcoin (I think they will give you a moneypak code). However, they probably take a fairly large cut. You can also withdraw BTC to an exchange, place a sell order, and then withdraw USD from that exchange, say, via Dwolla, or however else you want to withdraw.

				Also, Don&#039;t forget the wiki. the url is the same as this forum, but at the end put /wiki I think it has most info that you are looking for. it works like google, type in the search terms that you are interested in and it will bring up the most relevant pages.
