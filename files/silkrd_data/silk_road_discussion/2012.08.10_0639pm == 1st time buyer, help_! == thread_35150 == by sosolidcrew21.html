				hi guys, im relatively new to silkrd, been browsing for a long time but due to being abroad visiting my motherland&nbsp; haven&#039;t really been able to buy anything yet. Im going home soon though and am itching to make my first purchase. I was just wondering, is anyone going to trust me seeing as i haven&#039;t bought anything yet? I totally understand vendors suspicions with the global police state we live in these days. <br />cheers

				Unfortunately no, they probably will not trust you at first. What they&#039;ll want you to do is FE, Finalize early, where you pay before the product arrives. It&#039;s strongly discouraged on the forums as you&#039;re paying for something you don&#039;t even have yet, but it&#039;s pretty much unavoidable for a first time buyer, unless you buy some other smaller things of the Marketplace first.<br /><br />If you go with a trusted and respectable vendor you should be fine, just check there long term AND short term trade ratings, don&#039;t FE to someone who is relatively unknown.

				Another newbie here: is it common practice for first time buyers to finalize early? All I keep hearing on this forum is that you should never finalize early, but I also understand that it is hard to trust someone with no feedback.

				I&#039;m new myself, but FE is not something that should be required. Both sides of the transaction should be honorable. There is an arbitrage system in place to keep both sides honest.

				Some vendors ask for FE from new buyers, some don&#039;t. You should be able to find a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE, just complete a few orders from them. Then when your stats are better, you can order from the other vendors without having to FE.

				I (as a vendor) do not ever require first timer buyers to F.E. The only thing that I ask of a first time buyer to please come back to the road after you get your product and Finalize!<br /><br />I normally explain that &quot;I do not get paid, until you finalize&quot;<br /><br />Most do!<br />
