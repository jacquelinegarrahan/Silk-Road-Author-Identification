				I have finally been able to login to my account after trying constantly for the past 18 hours or so, just long enough for me to see that the money in my account is set to show in BTC instead of USD, actually this has happened on both of my accounts. I am a little worried as to how/why this has happened after the site being down all day. <br /><br />Why would the site being down all day affect the settings of our accounts? What is happening exactly?

				My account was also shown in Bitcoins, which it hasn&#039;t been for a long time.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t notice if the listings were in $ or not.

				haha this is weird.. seems to be for everyone and even if you try changing it it still says its set to dollars?? Least for me... Not too big a deal though guess I need to just do some math or switch it to coins so prices show in that for the moment!

				I expect the server software was updated. That would also explain the downtime.

				They probably got tire of people saying &quot;Why is my balance dropping??&quot; every time bitcoins go down. There are no US dollars on the silk road, just an estimated US dollar value based on the value of bitcoins.

				My currency display was reversed, hedging options turned off, was put on vacation mode, and most annoying, my shop&#039;s info page got completely wiped out. No i have to go on a quest to find my public key to repost.
