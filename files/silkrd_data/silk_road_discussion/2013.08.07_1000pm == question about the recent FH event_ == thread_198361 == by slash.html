				tor-announce] Tor security advisory: Old Tor Browser Bundles vulnerable<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />&nbsp; This is a critical security announcement.<br /><br />&nbsp; An attack that exploits a Firefox vulnerability in JavaScript [1]<br />&nbsp; has been observed in the wild. Specifically, Windows users using the<br />&nbsp; Tor Browser Bundle (which includes Firefox plus privacy patches [2])<br />&nbsp; appear to have been targeted.<br /><br />&nbsp; This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 17.0.7 ESR [3]. The following<br />&nbsp; versions of the Tor Browser Bundle include this fixed version:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3.25-10 (released June 26 2013) [4]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.15-alpha-1 (released June 26 2013) [4]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.15-beta-1 (released July 8 2013) [5]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.0alpha2 (released June 30 2013) [6]<br /><br />&nbsp; Tor Browser Bundle users should ensure they&#039;re running a recent enough<br />&nbsp; bundle version, and consider taking further security precautions as<br />&nbsp; described below.<br /><br />WHO IS AFFECTED:<br />&nbsp; In principle, all users of all Tor Browser Bundles earlier than<br />&nbsp; the above versions are vulnerable. But in practice, it appears that<br />&nbsp; only Windows users with vulnerable Firefox versions were actually<br />&nbsp; exploitable by this attack.<br /><br />&nbsp; (If you&#039;re not sure what version you have, click on &quot;Help -&gt; About<br />&nbsp; Torbrowser&quot; and make sure it says Firefox 17.0.7. Here&#039;s a video: [7])<br /><br />&nbsp; To be clear, while the Firefox vulnerability is cross-platform, the<br />&nbsp; attack code is Windows-specific. It appears that TBB users on Linux<br />&nbsp; and OS X, as well as users of LiveCD systems like Tails, were not<br />&nbsp; exploited by this attack.<br /><br />IMPACT:<br />&nbsp; The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution, so an attacker<br />&nbsp; could in principle take over the victim&#039;s computer. However, the<br />&nbsp; observed version of the attack appears to collect the hostname and MAC<br />&nbsp; address of the victim computer, send that to a remote webserver over<br />&nbsp; a non-Tor connection, and then crash or exit [8]. The attack appears<br />&nbsp; to have been injected into (or by) various Tor hidden services [9],<br />&nbsp; and it&#039;s reasonable to conclude that the attacker now has a list of<br />&nbsp; vulnerable Tor users who visited those hidden services.<br /><br />&nbsp; We don&#039;t currently believe that the attack modifies anything on the<br />&nbsp; victim computer.<br /><br />WHAT TO DO:<br />&nbsp; First, be sure you&#039;re running a recent enough Tor Browser Bundle. That<br />&nbsp; should keep you safe from this attack.<br /><br />&nbsp; Second, be sure to keep up-to-date in the future. Tor Browser Bundle<br />&nbsp; automatically checks whether it&#039;s out of date, and notifies you on its<br />&nbsp; homepage when you need to upgrade. Recent versions also add a flashing<br />&nbsp; exclamation point over the Tor onion icon. We also post about new<br />&nbsp; versions on the Tor blog: https://blog.torproject.org/<br /><br />&nbsp; Third, realize that this wasn&#039;t the first Firefox vulnerability, nor<br />&nbsp; will it be the last [10]. Consider disabling JavaScript (click the blue<br />&nbsp; &quot;S&quot; beside the green onion, and select &quot;Forbid Scripts Globally&quot;).<br />&nbsp; Disabling JavaScript will reduce your vulnerability to other attacks<br />&nbsp; like this one, but disabling JavaScript will make some websites not work<br />&nbsp; like you expect. A future version of Tor Browser Bundle will have an<br />&nbsp; easier interface for letting you configure your JavaScript settings [11].<br />&nbsp; You might also like Request Policy [12]. And you might want to randomize<br />&nbsp; your MAC address, install various firewalls, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp; Fourth, consider switching to a &quot;live system&quot; approach like Tails [13].<br />&nbsp; Really, switching away from Windows is probably a good security move<br />&nbsp; for many reasons.<br /><br />&nbsp; And finally, be aware that many other vectors remain for vulnerabilities<br />&nbsp; in Firefox. JavaScript is one big vector for attack, but many other<br />&nbsp; big vectors exist, like css, svg, xml, the renderer, etc. We need<br />&nbsp; help improving usability of (and doing more security analysis of)<br />&nbsp; better sandboxing approaches [14] as well as VM-based approaches like<br />&nbsp; Whonix [15] and WiNoN [16]. Please help!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />only old version of TBB could be affected by the exploit as vulnerability was fixed in firefox 17.0.7,<br /><br />can someone confirm this is correct info?and how torproject happen to be aware of that vulnerability before it occurs?<br /><br />thanks

				Please take some time to read the main threads on the forum before you ask a question.<br /><br />As has been said many times in many threads and on many web sites, yes, only older versions of the browser bundle are affected. If you are using the latest browser bundle, released on June 26, you are safe against that exploit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if they knew specifically about that exploit until the reports came in that it was being used on FH, at which point they would have checked with the Mozilla people and confirmed that it was fixed in the version of Firefox that they used to build the latest Tor Browser.<br />
