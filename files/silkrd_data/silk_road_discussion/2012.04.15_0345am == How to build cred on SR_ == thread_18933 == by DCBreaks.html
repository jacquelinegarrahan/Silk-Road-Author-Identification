				Welcome,<br /><br />Well the best way to build cred is to basically be a good person all around. Making a bunch of crap purchases won&#039;t help anyways because if the vendor takes time to look at your buyer stats and sees 10 purchases and only 3-5 bitcoin spent they know what you are up to. <br /><br />Honestly the forums are a great way to build your reputation without making purchases. I think you should reconsider not being very helpful in the forums. Of you know an answer to something or have an opinion then voice it. It&#039;s a great way to get your name out there and it lets people know what you are about. Also when you make purchases don&#039;t let them auto-finalize. Meaning once you get your goods release the funds. There are vendors out there that allow everyone to stay in escrow even new users. Stick with them in the beginning. If you must finalize early use trusted vendors so your stats do not get messed up. <br /><br />Honestly just be yourself and don&#039;t screw anyone and your credibility will come with time.<br /><br />Opiate-Power

You have to buy stuff.<br /><br />Get some bit coins, choose a trusted vendor and spend them on something you&#039;d like.&nbsp; Surely you&#039;ve used e-bay before.&nbsp; Pretty much the same rules apply.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t spend on here more than you can afford to lose.

				There are very reputable vendors here that don&#039;t require FE even for new buyers.&nbsp; Start small, treat them right (finalize when the product arrives and leave honest feedback) and go from there.<br /><br />If what you&#039;re looking for requires you to FE then pick the vendor with the best stats (tenure, feedback), not necessarily the best price and stay reasonably small.&nbsp; This is how you build cred.<br /><br />Oh, and once you have it, don&#039;t FE anymore, escrow is for your protection, it&#039;s easy for someone to set up an account and bolt with thousands of dollars, a good rule is if it&#039;s too good to be true, it probably is.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Hawk

				It&#039;s not really that hard to build cred without screwing yourself in a scam. A lot of people tell you not to finalize early no matter what, but honestly you may have to for your first few purchases. The key is to really explore a vendor&#039;s feedback page and Rumor Mill thread before going with him. Make sure nothing seems fishy. Go with a vendor who is in the top 10% of vendors on all of the Silk Road and finalize early if they require it for new buyers. Trust me, you&#039;re almost certainly not going to get screwed by a vendor that has a 100% feedback rating with over 300 sales and a Rumor Mill thread filled with glowing reviews. Just be smart. Unless you&#039;re from the Netherlands, don&#039;t purchase from there because you&#039;re basically just asking for your package to get intercepted. Try and buy from someone in the same country/continent if possible, although if you&#039;re in the U.S., there are a number of European vendors that have no problems shipping overseas. I finalized early for my first couple of purchases without any issues using the above method. And there are vendors that I still finalize early for just as a courtesy because they&#039;re so professional and consistent. But now my buyer stats are more than enough to ensure that I can stay out of escrow if I so choose. Just don&#039;t expect that luxury when you have no purchases and could easily scam an established vendor.<br /><br />Welcome to paradise. Enjoy your newfound freedom. Just remember that freedom means you need to be responsible.

				You should message Vendors on SR as well, talk to them about what you want to purchase. Any decent seller wont mind discussing things with a customer. I certainly don&#039;t. :)

				&nbsp;thanks for the reply, PharmaKarma, <br /><br />I am very new here, studying up hard, trying to learn everyone and and everything I need to before I make my first buy in maybe a month or two.<br /><br />As a new buyer who is purchasing tiny quantities of RC&#039;s, would it be better for me to cut my losses on a lost shipment from a reputable dealer instead of asking for a refund?<br /><br />I would never want a refund, just the stuff.

				Nice I am currently in the process of building creditability to apply for a bitcoin loan in order to start up a small local network.<br /><br />I am going to need an excellent supply of South American (or Japanese) cocaine, Afghani Heroin, and Ketamine .<br /><br />No actual funds deposited but I just wanted to let fellow forum members and vendors who browse know so if they see me asking for a larger than usual first buy they can recognize my name :)<br /><br />Ugh now we just need to do something about these prices...<br /><br />100 us for a gram of south american blow? Come on man...<br /><br />:)

				Stay out of the &#039;hot&#039; areas.&nbsp; Heroin is one of these.&nbsp; I started out in opiates, pain pills that is...lots of honest friendly vendors.&nbsp; After I&#039;d done that a couple of months, I went into heroin.&nbsp; This area seems to attract scammers.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to get scammed.&nbsp; Vendors send out a few good shipments, and then often they do their own product and get all strung out and just can&#039;t keep up with the whole thing, and pull a flim flam and go.<br /><br />But mostly just hang out, learn about security, pgp...try to help other new guys learn the ropes.&nbsp; People take note.&nbsp; Be nice to new vendors, they&#039;re having a hard enough time of it as it is...mostly just takes some study.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had to fight a vendor.&nbsp; I just finalize and move on.&nbsp; If my shit doesn&#039;t show--and this has happened a few times, I&#039;ll mention it to vendor, and then just figure it&#039;s my mailman getting high.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten pissed--did it today, but I just feel bad when I do that, and usually I&quot;m wrong anyway.&nbsp; There&#039;s no quick way to get cred, nor should there be.&nbsp;
