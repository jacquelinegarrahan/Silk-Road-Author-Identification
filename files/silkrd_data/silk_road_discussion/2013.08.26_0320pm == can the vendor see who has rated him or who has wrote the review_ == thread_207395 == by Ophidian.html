				can the vendor see who has rated him or who has wrote the review? or is it anonymous? Anonymous would be better, because some vendors blacklist the buyers if they not rate 5/5<br />

				Yes, currently the vendor can see the buyer&#039;s ID on feedback that he has left.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why buyers are so paranoid about being blacklisted for leaving honest reviews.<br /><br />Personally, if a buyer leaves me less than a 5, I want to find out why so that I can make it up to him and make sure that it doesn&#039;t happen again.&nbsp; How do I grow as a vendor if I don&#039;t learn from mistakes? How to I know I made a mistake if people don&#039;t tell me?<br /><br />Besides, anyone who would blacklist a buyer for leaving a 4 is not a vendor you want to deal with anyway.

				Not!!! Sellers can not know who has left a bad feedback if the buyer used a different Alias.

				And if a buyer finalizes and leaves a numerical rating without writing a review, there&#039;s no name, alias, or anything else associated with that rating, correct?<br />

				if they change their alias later on, does that retroactively change the alias for every feedback they&#039;ve left?
