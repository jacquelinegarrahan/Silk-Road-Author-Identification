				I just read the Secret Santa thread, and it inspired a serious benevolent streak.<br /><br />I was just wondering if anyone had ever considering a sticky &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; thread? I can already see the potential for mega scammers, so we could establish a few rules;<br /><br />1) Maximum offer to donate = 1 BTC<br />2) Minimum number of posts to claim BTC = 50<br />3) No Private Messages?<br /><br />I have found myself in positions where I&#039;d like to &quot;donate to a worthy cause&quot;, but I thought it may get hijacked by some lurker who just signs up to claim my loose change. This way, we could sort of mitigate that possibility, while allowing those who are really part of the community to participate in something charitable (and yes, the irony of me having less than 50 posts is not lost on me).<br /><br />Thoughts? Suggestions? Previous failures?

				Gah, i figured such an idea would definitely have come up before.<br /><br />Now, if only I could find the thread...ummm, Mal, would you be willing to point me in the right direction? I tried searching for &quot;Spare Coins&quot;, but I can only find reference to the thread, not the thread itself!

That member is still doing the same things and for the community on a regular basis and this was geeezz almost a year ago now (other buying forum/marketplace account for me if you think I&#039;m pulling shit out of my ass :-P) Maybe there was just never an official topic, but I believe the sentiment resides in all the positive entities that we are blessed to be in even the same forum. As cliche as is sounds, it definitely (the road, I mean) is just like a camaraderie for the majority of people. It&#039;s rare that I need a few extra btc&#039;s, but I&#039;ve made some lifelong friends here that when I&#039;ve been down on my luck, send me RIDICULOUS amounts of product &quot;on the front&quot; knowing I could never afford to pay him back. If the world/people weren&#039;t so corrupt with greed we could just live as one being. All for one and one for all HOOORAHHH!!!! Ok, over the top cliche. Anywho, I sincerely love this place and the majaority of people in it.
