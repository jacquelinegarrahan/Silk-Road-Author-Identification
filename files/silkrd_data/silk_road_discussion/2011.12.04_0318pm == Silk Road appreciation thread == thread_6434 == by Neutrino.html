				Silk Road, thank you for your tireless dedication to running and maintaining this incredible website. <br /><br />Most of us only think about the admins of Silk Road when something goes wrong. The rest of the time we complain about minor inconveniences like intermittent connectivity to the website and don&#039;t express our feelings.<br /><br />I think everybody who reads this should take the time to post their gratitude. You don&#039;t need to write an essay, a simple &quot;Thank you SR!&quot; will suffice. <br /><br />From the bottom of my heart: THANK YOU SILK ROAD. YOU&#039;RE AWESOME!

				I&#039;m in total agreement, it can&#039;t be easy running this site with the alphabet soup of government agencies breathing down your neck. Thank you SR for all of your hard work!!

				True, I remember the last thread that people on the forum were even talking about the admins of the site was when it was down and everybody was freaking out. <br /><br />Thanks for everything you do to keep this ship afloat! <br /><br />&lt;3 from Madame Bradley

				thank you sr for making me feel safe about buying drugs and not having to worry about my future career because of drug arrests. also thanks for providing me with superior product. Specifically the MDMA since everything is my area is cut to shit or they pass off meow meow as MDMA. Thanks for the drugs, the forums to help us with the experience, and just letting us be a part of this craziness.

				Silk Road is more than an anonymous way to receive product. It is more than a venue with potential for creating a strong network of high rated, high quality vendors....<br /><br />It is a message to a flawed system. It is a waving middle finger to a society that doesn&#039;t understand.<br /><br />And for that, we thank you.

				I&#039;m a newbie and I&#039;m just about to make my first purchase. Even though I&#039;m new, I&#039;ve spent quite a bit of time roaming around here lately and can say I already appreciate SR, especially all of you who are legit. <br /><br />Thank you! :)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Ever since the most recent maintenance downtime it feels like the connection to Silk Road is more stable and works on the first try more often. This just makes me what to thank the admins of the website even more! &lt;3
