				Hi,<br /><br />first of all thanks to the community &amp; the founders of silkroad for making sr &amp; the attached forum such a nice place. i really enjoy being here :) <br />it would be an even nicer place, if we could get rid of these scammers. Why don&#039;t we impose rules like this on the vendors:<br /><br />Vendors who require their customers to finalize early will be banned. <br /><br />To protect vendors from scamming customers, we could make an exception to this rule if the customer made less than say 5 purchases.&nbsp; If vendors are still afraid to get scammed, they could send their stuff with tracking. i wouldn&#039;t buy from them then anymore, cause i&#039;m not signing for packages that contain drugs, but maybe other people would ;) <br /><br />The vendors are already in a too strong position: They charge really high prices (see for example: opiates, prescriptions), they have not a high risk to get caught dealing (compared to dealing local on the streets), scamming isn&#039;t such a big problem for them as it is for their customer. Also, they can decline customers with a high refund rate.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m interested what you think about these ideas.<br /><br />Solumne

				Silly idea. People that finalize early are not REQUIRED to EVER, so why should vendors be punished for a choice made by a buyer? If you want to buy something and the vendor says you must FE early (most of the time this will be in their profile), you can simply just NOT BUY FROM THAT VENDOR AT ALL. If more people refused to finalize early, vendors would likely ask for it less frequently when they see the trend and be scared to lose business. <br /><br />To prevent against &#039;selective scamming&#039; (or simply people falling off the face of the earth after large buys), buyers should also never FE even if they have a good relationship or past history with a vendor. Even if you think you&#039;re &#039;being nice&#039; by releasing their funds early. Even if you think they are a &#039;trusted/respected&#039;. Even if they are your grandmother or firstborn child. It&#039;s these exceptions that make the escrow system faulty and not work as intended. <br /><br />In comment to your &#039;strong seller position&#039;, it&#039;s a double-edged sword. I would say buying personal use quantities from SR domestically is far less risky for both the buyer and seller, as no party has to hit the streets. For general buyers, 99.99% of the time the worst that can happen is something gets seized and you lose some money/product. No one has to deal with crazy lunatics in back alleys or form strong relationships with dealers to earn trust and buy product. The higher price on SR is due to the fact it&#039;s practically a CONVENIENCE STORE OF DRUGS THAT GET DIRECTLY SHIPPED TO ANY LOCATION YOU WANT. The reason prices are so high is because there&#039;s a demand for it and people buy it. Such is life.

				Chicken pox, small pox, a pox. A pox is a plague. It&#039;s just a turn of phrase, I highly doubt it has any special usage in any country. I called you a pox because you sounded like you support FE.<br /><br />And no, as a buyer refusing to FE your access is only limited by your own intelligence. It is the people who don&#039;t refuse FEing that make things worse for the rest of us. I&#039;m not one of the forum-warriors who decries it left and right, but I do certainly think that it is a pox. (See how I used it, again? :)

				^oops, that was from dictionary.com, forgot to mention it. Mirriam-webster also offers a similar definition:<br />Free Market (n.) an economic market operating by free competition<br /><br />Rather than make a almost completely useless post, I thought that while I&#039;m here, might as well point out that the number of scammer buyers vastly outnumber the scammer vendors we have seen here on Silk Road. They often receive much less publicity, as opposed to tony76, DrNyx, and all the others that were the subjects of widely publicized (or as widely publicized as it gets on the Silk Road forums ::)) witch hunts when they ran off with thousands of dollars of everyone else&#039;s money. Smaller vendors have had trouble starting up their businesses because of their customers allowing their transactions to auto-finalize, or finalizing late. Untimely finalizations result in the vendor&#039;s funds being tied up for long periods of time, which can be crippling for those who carry small inventories and need to constantly restock. <br /><br />For some vendors, FE has become a measure of security against the scammer and auto-finalizer. Unfortunate, but understandable in many cases.<br /><br />-schmuck

If you don&#039;t like it, then don&#039;t buy from him, simple as that. <br />If you don&#039;t like how you have no options for ketamine that don&#039;t involve FE, think about the fact that if the FE requiring vendor didn&#039;t exist, you would have no options for ketamine period.<br />Just by being there, even if he wants a million dollars a gram, and requires FE, he is already doing you a service.<br />If you don&#039;t like the way they run their business then just don&#039;t buy from them and leave them alone. The concept of not allowing vendors to require FE would be like not allowing a vendor to sell coke at any more than $20 a gram because you think that its unfair that they are all listing at upwards of $100 a gram, and you don&#039;t have any options for $20 a gram. If you force things on vendors to the point that the terms they have to agree with on are no longer acceptable to them, they will just leave, or find some way to pass the losses in profit down to the consumer (cutting the coke beyond recognition) and now everyone loses.<br />Now, I know that this is an exaggerated example, but the two scenarios differ only in magnitude, not in concept.<br /><br />People trying to impose regulations on others for their own benefit is a major reason why the economy in the United States (my country) is in such a slow, inefficient, imbalanced, and generally shitty state now.<br /><br />Now, that&#039;s not to say you don&#039;t have any way to fight back. Start selling ketamine, and don&#039;t require FE/do something that makes you more attractive to customers than other vendors. Set a standard of excellent communication, superior product, and sound stealth. Naturally, you will put them out of business, rake in generous profits, and build a loyal customer base. That is, until your competition finds a way to become more efficient and deliver a superior service to yours to get their business back. In the end, the vendors who deserve the most profits through their own hard work, resourcefulness, and innovation make the most profit. However, the real winner in this system is the consumer.<br />Such is the beauty of the free market ;)<br /><br />-schmuck<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />free market (n.) an economic system in which prices and wages are determined by unrestricted competition between businesses, without government regulation or fear of monopolies.<br /><br />That was my understanding of the &quot;free market.&quot; <br />Please don&#039;t take this as any form of disrespect or hostility.

				Nice rebuttal of the points I made in my previous posts.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53392.msg526340#msg526340">Quote from: Evanescence on October 16, 2012, 03:04 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I wish we could walk over to University of Chicago or some other top economics program to chat with the faculty, let them settle this.&nbsp; Alas I don&#039;t think they have time for two douche bags arm-chairing economics on a illegal drug forum.<br /><br />So instead we&#039;ll have to disagree, and for those who want the truth I suggest reading about free markets and related topics in Wikipedia.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh.. Wait...&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Virtually every post that you make causes me to me die a little inside.&nbsp; :-\<br />Just so you know, you&#039;ve won the accolade of being the first person I&#039;m adding to my ignore list - as a result, I will no longer be able to see nor respond to any of the drivel that your brain forces your fingers to type. I pity those fingers; they must be so embarrassed to have to take instruction from the mush of grey matter that your body attempted to form into a brain during your embryonic stage.<br /><br />By the by, when you ask for someone to &quot;by all means give us a counter example to one of my statements rather than just using insults&quot;, and they do so, instead of responding and calling them a &quot;douche bag&quot;, you should do as you have asked them to do.<br />Just a bit of advice for you to help you get along a little better in this community.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				All sales should be done by sales CONTRACTS that way Vendor/Buyer are both covered by the agreed upon contract no stating loss or undelivered parcels anymore as this is a big claim by buyers.There is something like 87% of desputes are false claims for non delivered parcels&nbsp; and Buyers are safe as long as they lie their ass off.<br /><br />The outcome is pretty simple also Buyers scam vendors and get caught they just go &amp; open another account and start again about 4 mths later.Vendors do the scamming &amp; everyone is on him in a heart beat because it gives vendors a bad name and makes SR look shady.CONTRACTS&nbsp; need to be implemented and used by the SR Marketplace to save Vendor/Buyer rights

SR is everything but a free market. There are so many rules imposed on the vendors. Just read the seller&#039;s guide.<br />Since there are already rules, we could change them a bit to keep the scammers out.<br />SR&#039;s rules right now attract a lot of scammers. it&#039;s just pretty easy for them to rip other people off. On the other hand side it&#039;s easy for vendors to prevent scamming by customers. The system is just lacking balance ....<br /><br />solumne<br /><br /><br /><br />
