				As an avid reader of all areas of the forums, I&#039;m almost certain that you are in fact BBB. What is it you hope to achieve by starting this thread? If you&#039;re that concerned, call the police, although I&#039;d recommend a psychiatrist.

				Seriously, this bloke is scattered and needs some professional help. Your posts are incoherrent, pointless, meaningless dribble written by kids with little to no educational experience. The childish rants made by these two has to be stopped and there accounts banned. I plead with the Mods to stop these two idiots now, dead in their tracks, and delete these two accounts. Posting about killing people and fucking someone else&#039;s mother and sister surely allows their accounts to be deleted? Allowing these fools to continue posting is not making sense, considering the content of the posts they&#039;ve already made. :( :(

				Good thinking AllDayLong. ???&nbsp; Excellent idea. ::) I read some posts by him/them to again press for his accounts to be banned and PM&nbsp; the MOD&#039;s. Enough is enough. How you can think a raving lunatic with multiple personalities, who continually posts threats of shooting people and fucking everyone&#039;s mother and sister (sincere or not) is just demonstrating normal, harmless behavior is beyond me! Everything in life has boundaries and this idiot has again crossed the line IMO. ???
