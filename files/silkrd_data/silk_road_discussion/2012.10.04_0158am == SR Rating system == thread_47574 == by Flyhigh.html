Some delays, but vendor had good communication so that helped.<br /><br />all those who leave feed back, that say FE will update, never do. Those who do that are hurt us all.<br /><br />lastly i know some vendors are slammed. but if you say its in transit, Please have it in the mail when you say that. We all know shipping times and unless its over seas most domestic US mail takes 3 to 4 days max 90% of the time.&nbsp; I rather have a vendor keep it in processing and let me know when it will be sent, so i can make plans to look for it. <br /><br />I think a 5 rating should given be when you meet all criteria, fast shipping, good product, sending the advertized product, good packaging and communication.1 star for each = 5 star rating...<br /><br />I say this because the vendors i deal with have taken the time to really work hard to get good ratings, and the ones that don&#039;t should not be rewarded.with a 5.&nbsp; Give honest ratings and we all will be better for it. peace&nbsp; :)<br /><br />and Buyers when you get your product finalize asap, we cant ask sellers to be more efficient and we don&#039;t keep our end up....<br /><br />Thats my rant for the day....thanks ;)<br /><br />FH<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know what you&#039;re saying in regards to rating based on 5 different points (product, quality, shipping etc.) but the way the feedback system currently works, anything less than a 5/5 is actually negative feedback and contributes negatively to a vendor&#039;s rating. Issuing a 4/5 or less indicates that the transaction was a bad one.<br />It is also unfair to take points away for shipping time and the like because vendors have no control over the postal system. Once it&#039;s been shipped on the date stated (which you can check by the postmark on the envelope) then there should never be a negative rating given where shipping is concerned.<br /><br />If the product is not as advertised or is underweight etc. bring it up with the vendor; any good vendor would usually be more than happy to fix the issue if the buyer is being honest and upfront about it rather than just down-rating them and never getting in touch to explain the issue.<br /><br />Vendors regularly look through their feedback to see if anyone has had any issues with their packaging or product. It&#039;s important that if you DO have an issue with an aspect of the vendor&#039;s service that you message the vendor about it; most vendors are very happy for constructive criticism from buyers as that criticism (especially regarding packaging methods) is what keeps their business safe and lets them know that they need to change their method.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I have a different question: how do I change my rating for a vendor? It happened that because of circumstances I&#039;ve given my vendor a 3 with a promise to upgrade in case we sort the matter to mutual satisfaction. Now, how&nbsp; do I do that?

This brings you to your account page. There&#039;s a panel on the right hand side entitled &quot;Account links&quot; - click the &quot;View feedback&quot; link and it&#039;ll take you to a page with all the feedback you&#039;ve given. Just click the &quot;edit&quot; button beside whichever feedback you want to change.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
