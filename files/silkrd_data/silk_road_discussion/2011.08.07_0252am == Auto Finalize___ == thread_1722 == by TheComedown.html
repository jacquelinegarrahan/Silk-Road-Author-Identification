				So I placed an order with a reputable vendor friday before last. The package didnt arrive so he sent out another one this last thursday. <br />I have heard that things will auto finalize after a certain amount of time. Is this true? <br />Right now its says I have 2 days to resolve. I dont want to do that quite yet because I trust that this vendor has sent the packages but I also dont want to lose my money. <br /><br />ANY ADVICE?????

				Have you contacted the vendor?<br />If you get scared you can start the resolution process. One of the options is the extend the deadline. <br />You do NOT need to wait until escrow times out to figure out what is going on. GreenCo gets pretty involved after 7 days : almost 2 weeks before anything comes due.

				Can u explain to me how the resolution process works? I am pretty new to this. This will only be my 3rd order ever on SR. I still havent gotten pgp figured out either which I have been working on.<br /><br />I just dont want to bash this vendor cuz he seems very reputable. The last time I heard from him was yesterday. I asked if he got the package in on thursday and he said yes and that it should take 2-3 business days for me to receive. That is what he said about the last package. I am seeing ppl giving good feedback even today though.<br />Im just really confused how this all works and what I should do.<br />Like what is the &quot;extended deadline&quot; and what/who is GreenCo?

				GreenCo is a marijuana cooperative that sells on Silk Road. I use them as an example a lot because I am a member so I can talk smack about my own family (though we&nbsp; disagree sometimes) without naming other vendors. They have an OK reputation http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1647<br /><br />PGP: have you looked at <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1048.0<br /><br />Starting a resolution is not awful so if you get worried, than go ahead and do it.&nbsp; You are best off communicating with the vendor. Give them 24 hours MINIMUM to respond, possibly more over the weekend. Most established vendors are much more worried about their reputation/rating than a single sale and because you can rate them at any time, this is in your favor. <br /><br />One problem with resolution is that it involves a Silk Road Admin. They are great but it does mean they have less time to do other stuff (web site improvements). They offer only 2 options: deadline extension and refund %. <br />I recommend:<br />1:Try to contact vendor and work something out<br />2: Bring it to the forum (being very polite and discrete) and look for advice.<br />3: The Resolution Process (Bringing in a Silk Road admin to mediate of you)<br /><br />&lt;for reputable sellers, if you suspect a scammer act differently&gt;
