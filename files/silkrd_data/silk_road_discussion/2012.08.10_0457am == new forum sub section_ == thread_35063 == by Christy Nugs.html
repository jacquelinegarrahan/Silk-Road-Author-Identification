				I have a great idea - lets get a new sub section in the discussion section - we could call it beggars corner or buggers corner as the case may be.<br /><br />What do u guys think? Any threads - begging for bitcoins would automatically be moved there.&nbsp; That way any of the good hearted could go there<br /><br />and help out to their hearts content without the rest of us having to wade through the ultimately tedious beggar threads!!<br /><br />

				Just hire a mod who deletes these shameful begging threads and bans the creators for a better learning effect.<br />When I made my first buy on SR I wanted to buy the exact amount of BTCs which (of course) end in being short 0.x BTC. But like most users I didn&#039;t beg like a despicable piece of shit but learned about the fluctuation this way.<br /><br />Just my 0.02BTC. Greetings from a lurker.

				Guys you have to talk to the administrators about these things. I am not allowed the power that is so obviously needed here. I contact admins/ SR support and getting responses 24-36 hours later doesnt cut it.

				I seriously think we should formalise the loan system with a button on the main site. As well as gift other members on the site there could be a loan option. You would choose recipient, enter the amount, and the agreed repayment before a certain date. Possibly a penalty of 10% a day for late payment? When done, the offer is sent to the recipient. If he agrees then he gets the money. The loan will automatically be returned on the due date, or automatically deducted from next deposit.<br />If you were guaranteed to get it back( or more likely) people could set themselves up as usurers.&nbsp; Could be a nice earner for the more organised among us.<br /><br /><br />Alternately, those begging fuckers could learn to respect themselves. I always buy slightly more BTC than I need, its not rocket science. Or buy less drugs.

				I don&#039;t think begging threads should be allowed. this sounds pretty selfish, but I don&#039;t see why buyers can&#039;t PM the vendor just explaining the situation. I know I always do this if I&#039;m short just a few BTC on a larger listing, and they always accommodate me.<br /><br />Most begging threads are scammers taking advantage of people&#039;s benevolence. I just hate to see that happen

				I don&#039;t get some peoples hostility towards buyers for this. It is obviously a real issue, when you take into consideration the exchange rate fluctuates so much and that bitcoin are time consuming to acquire for some poeple. It would be cool to see some kind of formalised loan system though, that idea definitely has potential. <br /><br />But all this stuff require a fair bit of legwork and additional responsibility for people like nomad who are volunteering their time to this for free. It&#039;s not right to expect that because these threads irritate us, someone should clean them all up. It is pretty easy to just ignore them as long as we have some way of identifying them, like making it a rule to put a standardised tag in the title, e.g. [LOAN REQUEST]. Or giving people the option to mark the thread as a loan request at the time of posting. <br /><br />We need to think of ways that we can achieve the result we want with an absolute minimum of additional manual moderation work.

				The subsection that is definitely needed is in rumor mill. It needs to be sub divided just like the site is with a Cannabis, Stimulant, Opioid, and other drug section. <br /><br />One mod per section. This would really help keep the site cleaner and also let people navigate and find what topics may interest them the most.

				If a formal loan system were incorporated into SR and a section in the forums ( I know it would be a bit of work to implement) it would effectively banish itinerant vagabonds from the rest of the forums. They&#039;d simply get told to go and see the Shylocks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also sound available credit would expand the SR economy benefitting vendors and buyers alike.
