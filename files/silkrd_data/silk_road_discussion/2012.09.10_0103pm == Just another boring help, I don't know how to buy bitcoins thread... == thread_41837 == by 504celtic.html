				Yeah... I&#039;m familiar with the process of purchase those desirable little buggers from the US using the likes of Bit-instant to generate a Zip zap payment slip and off you pop to Walmart. I&#039;ve actually done this in the past.<br /><br />However I&#039;m now back in the UK and feel like I&#039;m going round in circles trying to source a discreet and trusted way of acquiring said coins.<br /><br />Any help would be MASSIVELY appreciated!<br /><br />&nbsp;:o<br /><br />Cheers dudes and dudettes!&nbsp; ;)

				If I buy bitcoins with my own identity how safely can I pass them on to another persona?<br /><br />Also just had a look at the site you suggested but it seems to run an error message when I attempt any kind of transaction... Ugh :/

But even if you do need to provide ID then it doesn&#039;t really matter, you&#039;re just buying bitcoins and sending them on. You&#039;ll be funding the account with a bank account which required ID anyway.

				Acquiring bitcoins is not difficult. Using them anonymously is moderately difficult though, at least at first. See the thread in my sig on Bitcoin and anonymity.<br /><br />- You ideally want 2 Factor B$ Anonymity.<br /><br />1. Your entry into the Bitcoin network i.e. your purchase of bitcoin, is not linkable to you.<br />2. Your traversal across the network e.g. to SR, is not linkable to you if you screw up part 1 or decide it&#039;s too difficult.<br /><br />You achieve No.1 by the way in which you acquire bitcoin.<br />You achieve No.2 by laundering your bitcoins.<br /><br />In RL, drug dealers launder the proceeds of crime after the transaction has taken place.<br />On SR, it is done before and after! LOL!<br /><br />Using both factors together, it is impossible to connect the financial transaction of obtaining illegal drugs with bitcoin to your person. Again, I recommend you read my thread in the signature.<br /><br />Also, look into bitcoin-otc and local bitcoin.

If you access their site via Tor they make you do the same.<br />Just for buying some coins to spend here you don&#039;t need to worry about it.

				I&#039;ve recently used Bitcoin Nordic which is a cash in mail service based in Copenhagen - only details needed are your wallet address. They do ask for an e mail address but I didn&#039;t include one and it didn&#039;t cause a problem.<br /><br />Aside from their fees it&#039;ll cost you about 9GBP to send the cash Royal Mail recorded international with compensation.<br /><br />Turnaround was 6 days from posting the cash to getting the coins. <br /><br />It&#039;s expensive but anonymous. Website is bitcoinnordic.com<br /><br />
