				Just an fyi for those interested. I thought about having some fun with this guy but just stopped responding instead.<br /><br /><br />nbeaupre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I want to order the 3.5 grams of the Diesel weed you have with free shipping for $45 for the eighth. The only thing is that I am a total of 0.06BTC short this minute when I went to check out. Can you please send me the 0.06btc to my Silk Road username nbeaupre or to my BTC address: 16KJvp6EJJvduVU9me4Mek6Wc1RcnzcBFY in case you don&#039;t have any bitcoins in your Silk Road account. I am going to order ASAP once I have the 0.06btc I need to order. Please e-mail me to let me know if you sent it to me and if you sent it to the btc address or my SR username please. Look forward to hearing from you so I can order ASAP. Thank You very, very much <br /><br />xpsbud &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I can lower the price of a listing if you want and make a custom order. <br /><br />nbeaupre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />you can&#039;t just send the 0.04btc i am short now? my btc address is: 16KJvp6EJJvduVU9me4Mek6Wc1RcnzcBFY in case you don&#039;t have any btc on your sr account <br /><br />xpsbud &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m sorry but If I sent out coin to every message like this I would be broke. Most of the messages are people just looking for free money and won&#039;t buy. I will give you the same listing but weight dead on at 3.5g - at a price 0.04btc lower. Gets you what you say you want doesn&#039;t it? <br /><br />nbeaupre<br />Dude 0.04btc wouldn&#039;t be a very lucretive scam if I just wanted free money like you say that everyone does. I REALLY do need the 0.04btc to place an order. If you have faith for like 10 minutes then you will see that I am really ordering from you. My btc address is: 16KJvp6EJJvduVU9me4Mek6Wc1RcnzcBFY just in case you don&#039;t have the 0.04btc On your Silk Road account and have to send it from a wallet, I know my main vendor always deposits the coins in a wallet off SR as soon as someone Finalizes in case SR ever got shut down all of the sudden. I would appreciate this very much man and you will see that not everyone is trying to &quot;scam&quot; you. Look here are my purchasing stats, [they speak for them self],<br />Recent purchasing statistics<br /><br />Total transactions: 50<br />Total spent: $2019.44<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 year<br />These statistics are made available to your vendors when you purchase an item so they can better judge whether they want to do business with you or not. The more transactions you make that go smoothly and you finalize in a timely manner, the more likely your next order will be accepted.<br />These are my real stats, All I did was just copy and paste them from the purchasing stats page. Some transactions are from redeeming Money Paks for Bitcoins though that is why the amount spent in USD looks low compared to the 50 completed transactions I have already Finalized and released the money to the venor and SR never had to do it for me, [Auto-Finalize], because I release the BTC as soon as I get my order in the mail. Any way I hope you can send this 0.04btc I am short, I can even pay it back to you when I buy more Bitcoins in like a week. I just want to place my order.<br />P.S. you don&#039;t have to send the btc to everyone who asks either, [most of them probably don&#039;t even really need it for an order from you that is why they ruined it for the honest people who really need the small amont of cash that they are short on ordering], I&#039;m short because the fee to redeem my Money Pak was 15% instead of 10%, [like it normally is], because my regular BTC vendor, that takes Money Paks in exchange for BTC, BTCBuddy, was out of btc at the time I redeemed my Money Pak for BTC so I used another BTC vendor on SR.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				I like how he changes from 0.06 BTC short to 0.04. Unless your listings are in dollars and it was because of the rate gonig up.. Why would someone try to scam for that little though? I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really effective... That was a really bad attempted scam :P

				I&#039;ve sent him 0.08 btc like 2 weeks ago, and a few days ago he starts trying to scam me again.. lol ... first time ok, but second time, how can he think of even trying.<br /><br />I felt so bad for him, his begging style, that i sent him the btc. I guess i shouldn&#039;t have empathy with silly losers like this anymore.

				Beggers on the forum?<br /><br />Reminds me of those desperate homeless cracks who hang around a street dealer looking for opportunity or dropped crumbs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nasty.
