If a vendor has nothing to sell, their profile will show the &#039;no listings&#039; notice; however, the actual page will always stay the same.<br /><br />The ONLY way to have a page which is just a user message interface is if you no longer have vending privileges and your account has been demoted to a regular user account.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
