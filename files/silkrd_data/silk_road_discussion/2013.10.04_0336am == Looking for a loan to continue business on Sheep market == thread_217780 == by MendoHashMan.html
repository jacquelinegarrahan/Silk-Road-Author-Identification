				Hey everyone, I am looking for a loan so I can keep business running. I am still on BMR as I always have been, but figured I should branch into sheep now that there are only 2 markets left! <br /><br />I need about 1.3 BTC I&#039;ll repay quick and with interest or give a great deal on some of my oil or other products.<br /><br />You can message me on BMR or SM under the same name, and that would be the best place to send funds as well. Thanks for the help, I know we are all going through some rough and stressful times right now, but I am determined to continue business and keep offering my services!

				That might help, thanks, I&#039;ll let you know if I get close enough for that to help. I have a few orders on BMR and I asked the buyers to release but told them it wasn&#039;t required, just would be appreciated, so maybe I&#039;ll have enough from that... I just want to get on sheep ASAP!
