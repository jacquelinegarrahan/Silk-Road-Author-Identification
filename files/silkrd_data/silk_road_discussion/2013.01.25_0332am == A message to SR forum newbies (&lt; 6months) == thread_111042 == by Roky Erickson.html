				Lately this place has been awash with members registered a month or two ago and who think it is their right to dictate how the forums should be run. Most of these people have no idea what DPR is about, or that he built SR and these forums on Libertarian/Agorist principles. Hell, most of these twits I have conversed with lately don&#039;t even know what Libertarianism or Agorism is. <br /><br />Libertarianism - An extreme laissez-faire political philosophy advocating only minimal state intervention in the lives of citizens.<br /><br />There is no exact definition of Libertarianism but this one sums it up nicely, and I can assure you the minimal state intervention referred to here has nothing to do with intervening with an individual&#039;s right to speak freely. It has more to do with practical implications i.e. roads, hospitals, rubbish removal etc.<br /><br />Agorism - a revolutionary libertarian political philosophy that advocates the goal of bringing about of a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, thus engaging in a manner with aspects of peaceful revolution.<br /><br />This does not have much to do with free speech but it is important to know that Samuel Edward Konkin III developed the Agorist philosophy with libertarian ideals in mind.<br /><br /><br />Recently there has been a lot of discussion about the censoring of these forums, a discussion I don&#039;t recall seeing when I first came here (mid to late 2011). It has always been a given that this place is completely free, no intervention from higher powers, unless, like in the case of roads and hospitals in the real world, it is practical (spam threads). That is what makes SR such a great place, truly unique in today&#039;s PC world. This is not just something I feel strongly about, I have no doubt my views were and I believe still are the majority held view. <br /><br /><br /><br />One of the worst words ever coined in the English language is offense/offensive, as it&#039;s often used to deny people their use of language. However I must say I find it incredibly offensive when someone who has not even been here a few months wants to dictate to members and mods alike what we can and can&#039;t discuss here. These people obviously heard about a place they can &#039;score&#039; and are treating SR as just that, another place they can score.&nbsp; (Am I the only person who can see a direct correlation between recent SR coverage on Fox News and a sudden influx of censorship loving lemmings?) They have no idea what members and DPR are talking about when they talk of a revolution, they most likely just pass it off as commies or hippies talking shit. However, when I see someone regged in dec2012 attempting to dictate the &#039;character&#039; of these forums, I can laugh and move on. Yes, I find it offensive, but that does not mean I have to be angry about it (pity is much nicer than anger). I am in no way forced to read what they have said nor do I need to respond, if I do that&#039;s my choice.<br /><br /><br />Some more discussion of free speech can be found in this thread, which was unfortunately locked (oh the irony) by a moderator after they left me a weak backhanded jibe in it, classy stuff: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110677.0<br /><br /><br /><br />So my message, to anyone who is unhappy with some of the subjects discussed in these forums, or to the lack of censorship/moderation, is that these forums are not for you, and for you to come in here and try and change the community to one that denies free speech is rude and pathetic. I am an atheist, I don&#039;t go to church groups and confront them about their beliefs I don&#039;t agree with, or demand they renounce their faith, so why come to a forum founded on Libertarian principles/ideals and call for censorship? As I have said before people who advocate censorship or more state control in general are the reason why we have to buy/sell drugs anonymously in the first place, for shame.<br /><br /><br />I would very much like to hear from DPR regarding the recent &#039;censorship for the good of the community&#039; mantra being employed by our mods lately, I don&#039;t believe the original DPR (many believe he sold SR to another entity, understandable if true) would approve.<br /><br /><br />To the mods, I have not been abusive nor have I broken any rules with this post. It is in the correct sub-forum, no need to be moved. I do not want this thread locked, ever, let the community decide when it is irrelevant and it will be buried accordingly. If it is derailed or if someone becomes abusive/breaks rules so be it, but don&#039;t deny the good guys their say because others broke rules. <br /><br /><br />tl;dr? <br /><br />In short - Laissez-faire<br /><br /><br />Peace out homies<br />

				You just don&#039;t get it champ. Do you think the Mod&#039;s are just given that role and allowed to do as they please? DPR and the Admins have rules and principals which the Mod&#039;s must follow and enforce across this growing community. Instead of whinging relentlessly and trying to reinvent the wheel, why don&#039;t you move on a leave SR? Your time has come and your way passed your use-by date. Start up a forum of your own and put us out of our misery. :( ???

				Actually, the admins specifically instructed moderators to delete/lock spam threads and scammer threads.&nbsp; That comes directly from &quot;the top&quot; - from inigo, in fact.&nbsp; So, yes, as moderators we are asked to help weed &amp; flush out scammers here on the forums.&nbsp; The admins themselves have deleted (and locked) many scammer threads in order to protect the community.

				Except, you know, when you were 14, you didn&#039;t give those hoodlums your $20 with the intent of transferring it to SR, while people on the forum are.

				For the record it should be noted that when people talk about &quot;free speech&quot; it&#039;s typically a reference to the legal concept that governments should not try to censor their subjects.<br /><br />A website owner having posts deleted is more of a property rights issue than &quot;free speech&quot; issue.&nbsp; No one has a &quot;right&quot; to take up space unwanted space on someone&#039;s server.

If I could be fucked I would go through his posts and find you an example of DPR speaking against censorship and FOR free speech.

				Roky the serial pest, enough is enough. If your so versed in agorist/libertarian ideals as you proclaim to be, stop hiding behind this &quot;fake&quot; account, stand by your convictions and post from your vendor&#039;s account. Only a coward hides behind a mask to express their true feelings instead of taking a stance to passionately fight for your rights and beliefs. SR is a business. It has an owner/s, Administration staff who are in charge and Mod&#039;s and Support Staff, who all contribute to keeping the site up and operational. The object of any business worldwide is to MAKE MONEY!! That&#039;s the objective of everybody who starts a business! After all is said and done, a business has to make a profit for it to remain afloat and there is no doubt the profitability of SR is continuing to grow immeasurably. DPR is certainly reaping the fruits of his labor and considering what he has managed to achieve thus far, it&#039;s hard to have anything but admiration for his efforts and skill.&nbsp;

He was free.&nbsp; People like him, little by little, weakened the state and strengthened the market.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road, and what a ride it has been.&nbsp; No longer do I feel ANY frustration.&nbsp; In fact I am at peace in the knowledge that every day I have more I can do to breath life into a truly revolutionary and free market than I have hours in the day.&nbsp; I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive.<br /><br />We are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor.&nbsp; It&#039;s a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society.&nbsp; All manner of corporation, government agency, small family businesses, anything that can gain a foothold and survive.&nbsp; But the environment is rapidly changing and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road.&nbsp; You can see it, but you can&#039;t touch it.&nbsp; It is elusive, yet powerful, and we are evolving at a rapid clip, experimenting, trying to find sturdy ground we can put roots down in.<br /><br />Will we and others like us someday grow to be tall hardwoods?&nbsp; Will we reshape the landscape of society as we know it?&nbsp; What if one day we had enough power to maintain a physical presence on the globe, where we shunned the parasites and upheld the rule of law, where the right to privacy and property was unquestioned and enshrined in the very structure of society.&nbsp; Where police are our servants and protectors beholden to their customers, the people.&nbsp; Where our leaders earn their power and responsibility in the harsh and unforgiving furnace of the free market and not from behind a gun, where the opportunities to create and enjoy wealth are as boundless as one&#039;s imagination.<br /><br />Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already.&nbsp; Will it happen overnight?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Will it happen in a lifetime?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Is it worth fighting for until my last breath.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve seen what&#039;s possible, how can you do otherwise?&nbsp; How can you plug yourself into the tax eating, life sucking, violent, sadistic, war mongering, oppressive machine ever again?&nbsp; How can you kneel when you&#039;ve felt the power of your own legs?&nbsp; Felt them stretch and flex as you learn to walk and think as a free person?&nbsp; I would rather live my life in rags now than in golden chains.&nbsp; And now we can have both!&nbsp; Now it is profitable to throw off one&#039;s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically.&nbsp; How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets?&nbsp; The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!<br /><br />I have no one to share my thoughts with in physical space.&nbsp; Security does not permit it, so thanks for listening.&nbsp; I hope my words can be an inspiration just as I am given so much by everyone here.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.<br /><br />From their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny.&nbsp; But such vision was a curse.&nbsp; Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit.&nbsp; It was horribly depressing.&nbsp; Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out.&nbsp; But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones.&nbsp; I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance.&nbsp; How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies.&nbsp; How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able.<br /><br /><br />Very well put I thought. I owe all my current success to the Austrian school of economics, so this part resonated with me strongly. He is not wrong though, the more you learn about the current global economic system, the more you notice the devastating effects it has on humankind, financially and more importantly morally, and it can be horribly depressing. I cant say I am completely void of frustration at the sad state of the world, but vending on silk road sure does help, and I only see it getting better.<br />

Douche doesn&#039;t get it through his thick skull he can&#039;t do anything to my reputation, b/c no one listens to him. ::) And he says he is a well-known vendor? I think we can rule that out.

She must feel like calling it &quot;quits&quot; and try for the next life-time ::) :P Oh well, sucks to be Roky. :D <br /><br />No one here has heard of him before, apart from being &quot;that attention-seeking dick&quot; who really needs to look for employment rather than crying every time he comes in here. :&#039;( lol :)

				Hey Raz,<br /><br />What do you make of post #26 by nomad. He said he has had a post deleted between yours and mine, confirming his suspicions about someone deleting his posts. He said goodbye and instead of rampaging, he will leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br />Is he fair dinkum or just blowing off some steam&nbsp; do you think? If nomad goes, that&#039;s very strange.

Has been in Newbie forum answering q.s. From what I saw, there was little thanks. :-\<br /><br />I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll be fine after sleep, roll, and rock, and if he isn&#039;t, well, we&#039;ll know in due course.

Like I have said in another thread this forum is not for you, you believe you have the right to delete posts you feel are offensive,&nbsp; I and many other like-minded individuals don&#039;t want you as a moderator, we did fine without you, we will continue to do well if you leave.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />SSBD is correct in saying you just don&#039;t get it! ??? Who cares what you want? Your opinion on who should be a Mod is totally irrelevant as you have no stake in this Forum and therefore, no say on who does what. DPR, the person you idolize and speak so highly of, is the one who appointed SSBD as a Mod. Are you willing to publicly criticize DPR for who he selected to be a Mod? One thing is for sure, you have no support on the Forum for the way you have conducted yourself. To be spending so much time on the Forum shows business for you seems a little quiet. ??? I can almost sense a little jealously in your posts towards SSBD, at you being overlooked as a Mod (God help us).

My privileges on here can be removed at any time should those who run this site consider it warranted, my time here is voluntary and my only intention is to help, nurture and support the community, I would invite you to reflect on whether you can truly say that is also true about you.<br /><br />Your previous forum account had 174 posts and Roky had 20 before the new rules kicked in and you&#039;ve been here for so long and contributed so much? In my few months here I have tried to support and help as many people as I can in an informed and balanced way, occasional flame aside but overall levelheaded and balanced. My role as a moderator is to try and keep a semblance of balance without stifling discussion and freedom of expression but occasionally there is a need to step in an moderate, its called the job.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you will keep up your attempts to cause disharmony and unrest, thankfully we have you pegged as what you are, an annoyance who will fade away.<br /><br />Good night.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What was my last account? where is 174 coming from? heh like I said to nomad feel free to publicly out me you guys are way off (spoiler alert Frank Abignail)<br /><br />Anyway I have been doing some thinking, light meditation, some dark soul searching and then I got high as fuck, and it made me realise I am that bitter old guy whinging about how it used to be. Although I still stand by everything I said about censorship, the creation of this place and the evils of mods on powertrips (i.e. My role as a moderator is to try and keep a semblance of balance without stifling discussion), I am wrong to say the majority are with me on this one, as this thread so harshly points out (not one agreement..really? lol). Sure my kind were a dime a dozen in the early stages but I guess SR membership has probably quadrupled in the last year. Seeing how most of that increase has come from mainstream media coverage I guess it is only natural that the community&#039;s collective attitude would become more mainstream. Oh well that&#039;s just the way it is, an increase in customers is a nice consolation prize.<br /><br />I won&#039;t bother &#039;protesting&#039; from this account anymore, I doth protest too much it has been said, just a few more posts to reach 100. I apologize to all the people who were left butthurt from reading an anonymous stranger&#039;s rants.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also, the holocaust never happened that is a fact I don&#039;t care what anyone says.

A post will be deleted if it upsets others, abuses people, is racist or spreads hatred, amongst a list of other possibilities. Lowering ones morals to write a post is a stupid idea. If you can&#039;t write a post encompassing a topic without using morals, then it probably shouldn&#039;t be posted at all. Maintaining a degree of morals, etiquette and decorum is essential to maintain a certain standard a post must reach in order for it to be posted on the Public SR Forum.<br /><br />PS - Raz, morning has broken!! ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???

				Here&#039;s an observation that will no doubt earn me a a river of shit from ol mate Roky Erickson... but I am posting it without malicious intent and upon his very own principles of &quot;freedom of speech and opinions&quot;.<br /><br />Roky, you remind me of one of those dudes that rocks up to a nightclub but is too drunk (and angry) to get in... so you stand there abusing the bouncers, slinging shit at every one else that is walking in (or past) and generally stand around for way too long until you start to piss people off.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not going to argue whether are exercising a god given right to stand out the front of the nightclub and bang on about the injustice being served on you, but how long do you reckon you can do that for before the bouncers or the cops or the rest of the crowd who ARE having a good time, politely ask you to politely move on... because NO-ONE else in the vicinity really wants to hear your opinion.<br /><br />So after reading a bunch of your (mostly) inflammatory posts, imo this is what is happening here ol mate... you have some strong opiniowhat you should be able to do and say on the forums, but quite simply, the vast majority of people clearly don&#039;t want to hear them.&nbsp; Your posts are generally angry in tone, hostile in content and delivery, and on the whole don&#039;t add a scrap of value to the threads you post them in.&nbsp; You generally come across as someone who is just itching for an argument mate.<br /><br />So think of the mods as the bouncers, and all those -karma points you are getting as the &#039;other people in line&#039; that ARE getting into the nightclub...they have all had a gut full so maybe call it a night mate.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like the &#039;bouncers&#039; decision, and you don&#039;t like the &#039;crowd&#039;, and you don&#039;t have any intention on changing your tune, then maybe just move on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps go find a rowdy, stinking, shit hole-in-the-wall club that stinks like vomit and hate, and I am sure they will welcome you with open arms there... though you probably won&#039;t get heard above the other righteous defenders of freedom of speech who are all yelling at each other above the distorted tunes blaring from the two-dollar juke box <br /><br />I don&#039;t think your opinions are invalid, I just think you are continually trying to drive them down the throats of people that aren&#039;t interested in them.<br /><br />Good luck and happy travels Roky.<br />

				Sekure, the Great Aussie Philosopher, once again posting an accurate description of the situation at hand. Ol mate, Roky needs to realize this Forum, despite what he may think, has rules, morals and principals which are the fundamentals in creating the tone of the Forum. Without rules, there would be mayhem and chaos across the board, making Moderating the Forum a lot harder than it should be. At some point Roky, you need to concede that based solely on public opinion, and from people who have read your posts, your views haven&#039;t been accepted in the threads you posted in. Why that is the case is irrelevant as the fact remains, your opinions are not shared by the majority of others. Knowing this, why not share your opinions with other like minded people on another Forum? :P There are plenty to pick from on The Cleaned Hidden Wiki -&nbsp; http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />You will be much happier Roky, engaging like minded people to rant and rave about topics of your choice. Taking this same course of action here on the SR Forum, will only end badly for you champ and further jeopardize any future you may have here. ???&nbsp; &quot;YO&nbsp; ADRIAN&quot;

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=111042.msg760413#msg760413">Quote from: Roky Erickson on January 25, 2013, 03:32 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lately this place has been awash with members registered a month or two ago and who think it is their right to dictate how the forums should be run. Most of these people have no idea what DPR is about, or that he built SR and these forums on Libertarian/Agorist principles. Hell, most of these twits I have conversed with lately don&#039;t even know what Libertarianism or Agorism is. <br /><br />Libertarianism - An extreme laissez-faire political philosophy advocating only minimal state intervention in the lives of citizens.<br /><br />There is no exact definition of Libertarianism but this one sums it up nicely, and I can assure you the minimal state intervention referred to here has nothing to do with intervening with an individual&#039;s right to speak freely. It has more to do with practical implications i.e. roads, hospitals, rubbish removal etc.<br /><br />Agorism - a revolutionary libertarian political philosophy that advocates the goal of bringing about of a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, thus engaging in a manner with aspects of peaceful revolution.<br /><br />This does not have much to do with free speech but it is important to know that Samuel Edward Konkin III developed the Agorist philosophy with libertarian ideals in mind.<br /><br /><br />Recently there has been a lot of discussion about the censoring of these forums, a discussion I don&#039;t recall seeing when I first came here (mid to late 2011). It has always been a given that this place is completely free, no intervention from higher powers, unless, like in the case of roads and hospitals in the real world, it is practical (spam threads). That is what makes SR such a great place, truly unique in today&#039;s PC world. This is not just something I feel strongly about, I have no doubt my views were and I believe still are the majority held view. <br /><br /><br /><br />One of the worst words ever coined in the English language is offense/offensive, as it&#039;s often used to deny people their use of language. However I must say I find it incredibly offensive when someone who has not even been here a few months wants to dictate to members and mods alike what we can and can&#039;t discuss here. These people obviously heard about a place they can &#039;score&#039; and are treating SR as just that, another place they can score.&nbsp; (Am I the only person who can see a direct correlation between recent SR coverage on Fox News and a sudden influx of censorship loving lemmings?) They have no idea what members and DPR are talking about when they talk of a revolution, they most likely just pass it off as commies or hippies talking shit. However, when I see someone regged in dec2012 attempting to dictate the &#039;character&#039; of these forums, I can laugh and move on. Yes, I find it offensive, but that does not mean I have to be angry about it (pity is much nicer than anger). I am in no way forced to read what they have said nor do I need to respond, if I do that&#039;s my choice.<br /><br /><br />Some more discussion of free speech can be found in this thread, which was unfortunately locked (oh the irony) by a moderator after they left me a weak backhanded jibe in it, classy stuff: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110677.0<br /><br /><br /><br />So my message, to anyone who is unhappy with some of the subjects discussed in these forums, or to the lack of censorship/moderation, is that these forums are not for you, and for you to come in here and try and change the community to one that denies free speech is rude and pathetic. I am an atheist, I don&#039;t go to church groups and confront them about their beliefs I don&#039;t agree with, or demand they renounce their faith, so why come to a forum founded on Libertarian principles/ideals and call for censorship? As I have said before people who advocate censorship or more state control in general are the reason why we have to buy/sell drugs anonymously in the first place, for shame.<br /><br /><br />I would very much like to hear from DPR regarding the recent &#039;censorship for the good of the community&#039; mantra being employed by our mods lately, I don&#039;t believe the original DPR (many believe he sold SR to another entity, understandable if true) would approve.<br /><br /><br />To the mods, I have not been abusive nor have I broken any rules with this post. It is in the correct sub-forum, no need to be moved. I do not want this thread locked, ever, let the community decide when it is irrelevant and it will be buried accordingly. If it is derailed or if someone becomes abusive/breaks rules so be it, but don&#039;t deny the good guys their say because others broke rules. <br /><br /><br />tl;dr? <br /><br />In short - Laissez-faire<br /><br /><br />Peace out homies<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have not had any posts censored despite having several controversial ones. That said I agree with this, censorship should be limited to spam not controversial topics. I hate censorship. DPR and admins and mods can do whatever the fuck they want of course, but I vote strongly against censorship. <br /><br />edit: oh yeah limetless actually did delete several of my threads in one day :rolls eyes: . To be fair I was indeed trolling in several of the ones made in response to his censorship :P.

It would not be in violation of Agorist principles for DPR to censor the information on the forum that he runs, it is his to do as he pleases with as he is the person who runs it.

As you have just posted , Agorists/Libertarians do think that the final call for censorship is the right of the property owners. As DPR is the property owner in this case, he sets the rules by which the Mod&#039;s must follow and enforce across the entire community. the member , Roky, wanted Moderator, SSBD removed as he was deleting his posts on numerous threads. What Roky can&#039;t get through his head is this. DPR has asked SSBD to moderate the Forums a certain way. SSBD has a job to do and DPR has asked him to do it a certain way. SSBD has removed these posts by Roky because they were not of a nature conducive to some spirited debate, but full of anger, hatred and resentment aimed at anyone who may be relatively new to the site.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Roky Erickson,<br /><br />Do you even know what you are talking about? There are no free speech issues at stake here.<br /><br />Free speech applies when governments try to regulate the speech of individuals. If you come into my house, you don&#039;t have a right to free speech. I can regulate your speech by kicking your out of my house if I don&#039;t like what you are saying.<br /><br />The same applies here. There is no governmental entity, but there are community standards, enforced by excluding those that refuse to take part in the covenant that we have here.<br /><br />I noticed a couple of weeks ago what happened to one covenant violator. He was offering assassination services, and was censored. Another was offering services relating to theft/fraud, and was censored. Essentially they were people that refused to follow the covenant established here, and they were excluded. That aligns perfectly with libertarian/voluntarist principles.

Want to say a big TY to &#039;Chi Guevara&#039; for efforts on forum today. This is the shit, it really is..... And this is why Chi Guevara will always have friends on SR. Piece out.<br /><br />I&#039;m just looking at nanpa2001 post and all the others above, and thinking this thread really did backfire a little for Roky. Epic. No one here think that mods censor things. Everyone, or most, is on board on this issue. I&#039;m glad that people can differentiate the difference between stand-over modding and responding to a threat caused by a parasite. No mod has ever censored someone that I can recall. In fact, if you look at the stuff here, with the allowed swearing and so forth, I think it&#039;s pretty damn generous what we can say here. If some mod censors someone, you can bet they stuffed up pretty badly (lol, the member not the mod ::) ). I mean, if you find SR forums too tough when it comes to censorship, shit, you must have problems buddy. There IS no censorship. We are given a huge leash. Some trolls are can just never fit in no matter where they go. Oh well. Piss off Roky. :D<br /><br />If someone thinks a mod has gone too far, or, I&#039;ll make it even easier..... has even censored in the first place, raise you hand......? seriously, who has even been censored? b/c it takes a fair bit.<br /><br />Piece out.
