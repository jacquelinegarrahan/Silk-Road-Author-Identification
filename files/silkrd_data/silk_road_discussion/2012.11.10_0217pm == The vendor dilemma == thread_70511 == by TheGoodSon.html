				With the recent instabilities with SR and the now apparent outage, there is going to be a change in the way that business is conducted on the Silk Road. Myself, while I can afford to float escrow, situations like this will reinforce the push for early finalization. <br /><br />Myself, I will be requiring early finalization when SR comes back. I wish it wasn&#039;t so, but with this being Onionland and my having perfect feedback, I hope it won&#039;t be perceived too badly.<br /><br /><br />Are any other vendors considering mandating FE as a course of these outages?

				Hope DPR saves the day because if SR will eventually be up again I think we&#039;ll see a drop in demand if all the vendor ask an early FE

				I doubt there would be a drop in demand, most sellers are very well established by now and it would really only affect newcomers.

				I&#039;m considering it, it&#039;s so fucked up to my loyal buyers but I just can&#039;t afford to keep my funds in escrow. I make so little profit my next batch is mostly funded by my escrow :(<br /><br />Dank

				That is your decision, just keep in mind that many buyers avoid vendors who sell outside of escrow.

				I already have to purchase all my bulk outside of escrow but when I use sr for business the only reason I do is because I&#039;m protected by escrow.<br />I understand why you guys would ask it but there&#039;s no way I&#039;m going to start FE for all the vendors I use and just start giving money away, possibly.

				First off, everyone needs to smoke a bowl and just give this a little time and lets hope its just like every other time and DPR pulls through....smoke a bowl like I am currently and then enjoy the day and check back tomorrow ;) But most importantly I can&#039;t even imagine how vendors would be impacted by losing funds as I myself currently have around 1500 floating around space right now :/ Ok little off course but I was thinking if vendors are going to require FE and some already do like mentioned for bulk amount and obviously some vendors prefer just to deal with bulk buyers so I foresee that even if SR is done for then vendors could still do business via tormail and just use multiple wallets or whatnot and continue to do business with their already built client list... yea its buyers choice to send BTC up front and hold all faith in a random person on the other end but isn&#039;t that what we do when we FE??? Regardless of what some say about FE, being scammed comes down to the character of the person period!! I trust a couple vendors on here with FE and they have never let me down and I see worst case scenario we still have the forums to communicate so its just a non-commission email only platform but I don&#039;t see why this wouldn&#039;t work?? Any ideas? Enjoy the weekend guys, Ill be sure to enjoy what I have collected off this site this weekend and hope many others do the same ;) :) !!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I never ask for FE - I have 100% FB. Life&#039;s a chance &amp; I have a blacklist so I cancel the next time around. Simple. 99% of buyers want/need/love SR - they want it to continue so I trust &amp; it pays off.
