				My apologies if these things have already been discussed, but as I&#039;m new I&#039;m still getting to grips with the system, so please forgive anything I may have repeated!<br /><br />Hopefully I&#039;ve come up with at least one new idea!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />SR is a wonderfully smooth system, but I have noticed certain little things are lacking, and as we know, sometimes, little things can make ALL the difference!<br /><br />Price Low/High and High/Low<br /><br />PRICE: Highest First<br />PRICE: Lowest First<br /><br />PRICE + P&amp;P: Highest First<br />PRICE + P&amp;P: Lowest First<br /><br />It&#039;s annoying seeing an item you wish to purchase, and you try to buy it, but it&#039;s out of your reach because of postage! So, this feature would be so helpful there!<br /><br />If you like this item, you might also like feature, would be cool, as so much is out there, something good might be missed! :) <br /><br />Vendors being able to leave their customers feedback, and see their prospective clients % score, like we can see theirs!<br /><br />It happens on every other major online market site, and if this is supposed to be the Ebay of freedom, why not here? :) <br /><br />It would also assist the vendor to know whether the client is any good or not, so that would better for their security!<br /><br />A blacklist feature where consumers can block vendors, and vendors can block consumers, if you don&#039;t get on, or if the vendor is a scamming arsehole!&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />BTC Conversions in GBP, CDN, AUS, YEN, etc - Would make life much easier!<br /><br />A Today&#039;s Deals/Deal of the Day, section would be good, where vendors can do special offers!<br /><br />Just a few little things I&#039;ve noticed, that could be improved on, if it&#039;s necessary! ;)

				Great suggestions SugarRush.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure DPR would love to add these features. Seems like he keeps pretty busy with the day to day issues on the site. Maybe one day though!

				Definitely +1 on these suggestions. One of the only things I&#039;ve noticed SR lacking the most is just that basic feature. Perhaps it would increase competition somewhat making the cheaper and more expensive vendors so clearly ordered.

				All of the above (although you can now see postage options if you click on an item) PLUS a wish list. And maybe automatic multiple checkout boxes if you have items in your cart from multiple vendors.

				Two things are asked for over and over on these forums; <br />1) Is [Highest to Lowest] and [Lowest to Highest] options for sorting the listings. And<br />2) Is the option to see prices in £(GBPs) or EUROs.<br />I don&#039;t know why, especially during this recent redesign, these things weren&#039;t added. I&#039;m starting to think no-ones listening.<br /><br />Anyway, welcome to the &#039;Road&#039; Sugar Rush. Are you named after the TV series of the same name?<br />Hope you find what your looking for here, and enjoy this wonderful site to it&#039;s full potential. :)

				I think it would be useful to display a little natioinal flag next to country of origin. <br /><br />Also the ability to filter by continent or country (not just your own). I wish I could exclude NL, or do CAN + US.

				Great suggestions, but this probably should have been posted to Feature Requests. Either way, no big deal. I&#039;m sure a mod could move it or something if they felt it necessary, and it&#039;s discussing Silk Road so I&#039;m sure there won&#039;t be a problem with this being posted here&nbsp; :)
