				Hello <br /><br />I will soon be setting up a seller account on Silk Road to sell some stuff. However, I noticed upon trying to sign up that there is roughly a Â£100~ sign up fee and it mentioned in the sellers guide there is commission on each item sold - it didn&#039;t say how much, only that there was. <br /><br />Personally I think the start up fee is a significant barrier to entry that will worsen the service available to consumers, and I will be operating on relatively small margins so a significant commission on revenues could really eat into my profits. <br /><br />However, I really do appreciate what Silk Road is doing and they have every right to expect to make some money out of this.<br /><br />So, can any of you clear this up, what are ALL the fees I&#039;ll need to pay for selling on Silk Road? What is the commission I pay on the products I will AND are there any hidden fees I&#039;ve missed? Depending on what the costs are I may have to reconsider whether I want to do this given the risk if I&#039;m not making much money.

				The commission is 6.25% on each item. If you use hedged escrow you usually lose 4% of your listed price.<br /><br />for example. If you list an item for $100 it will show to buyers as costing $106.25. Once the buyer finalizes you will have ~$96 transferred to your account.<br /><br />I hope this helps answer your questions as this information is to the best of my ability. (If anybody reading this finds an error please let me know.)

I would say 6.25% was relatively cheap if it weren&#039;t for the start up fee. Can someone just explain to me what escrow is and whether I really need to use it?<br /><br />Thanks

				You can learn about escrow by reading the seller&#039;s guide (which you should do if you haven&#039;t already) and by re-reading the seller&#039;s guide. You can also read about it on the wiki: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Escrow<br /><br />You must use escrow to be able to sell on the Silk Road.<br /><br />Commission does apply to postage.<br /><br />

				Sorry to highjack your thread mate but I could have sworn the commission was 9%? or were they thinking about boosting it up to 9%?

				It was briefly increased to 9%. I contacted SR Support and they said that they changed it back and wouldn&#039;t raise it without warning in the future.
