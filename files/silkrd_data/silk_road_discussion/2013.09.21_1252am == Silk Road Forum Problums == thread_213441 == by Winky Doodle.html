				Anyone know what&#039;s with the new links for the SR marketplace? And why I can&#039;t log in and it just says invalid log-in or goes to unconnected page<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to get onto SR and finalize and review my order but it&#039;s been down for .a couple days nows<br /><br />Nvm figured out what it was. People are changing the SR links on hidden wiki to phishing scams.

				Umm, I don&#039;t know anything about new links for the marketplace. If you aren&#039;t on http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/, then you are probably on a phishing site.

				Why save a link, the whole reason is to stay anonymous right? What if police busted down your door and took your computer and had a warrant and they found drugs and a link to SR saved you&#039;d be fucked. I didn&#039;t know Hidden Wiki users could change the Commercial services links.

				What&#039;s TTB?<br /><br />I don&#039;t save any shit, I just keep my Tor Bundle updates and use the links off Hidden Wiki, and SR was the only link I ever went to. I browsed SR for a few months then didn&#039;t buy anything, must of visited it like 30-40 times, then returned just now and been browsing for 3-4 weeks and made a purchase, then 2 days go by and the link on Hidden Wiki is changed, so I thought with DPR&#039;s backup plan it was something to do with that. I didn&#039;t know Hidden Wiki let it&#039;s user&#039;s just change Commercial Services links, I was using it for months before and that never happened.

I am well aware there will still be some traces of tor and the storage media but without it they don&#039;t have fuck all, sorry I lost it! it broke so I threw it away, whatever they cannot make you produce it, you are only fucked if they find it and you refuse to hand over the encryption key.
