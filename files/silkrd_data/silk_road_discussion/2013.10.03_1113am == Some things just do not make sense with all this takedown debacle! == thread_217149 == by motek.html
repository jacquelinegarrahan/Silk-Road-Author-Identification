				<br />&nbsp; Firstly,, after many people had been voicing the opinion that DPR had &quot;changed&quot; and that as of a few months ago, the &#039;tone&#039; of his messages were &#039;different ... this was when the site was &quot;updated/renovated&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;THEN....&nbsp; didn&#039;t the &quot;new&quot;&nbsp; DPR, introduce&nbsp; himself, again in a&nbsp; message &#039;signed&#039; with DPR&#039;s PGP signature! , admitting he had in fact&nbsp; &quot;taken over&quot; the site, which IIRC was confirmed by DPR!<br /><br />&nbsp; At the time, this didn&#039;t cause much fuss, and many members thought DPR had &quot;changed hands&quot; already once before, and that all things considered, it was good business strategy to cash out now and ponder his next venture!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;NOW, I do not understand how SR&#039;s servers (which are apparently in Iceland) were &quot;accessed/compromised&quot; unless they &#039;physically removed&#039; commandeered them!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; And here&#039;s something which had many IT experts puzzled, <br />when the FBI got their hands on that HUGE Bulgarian/Romanian DNS router botnet, <br />&nbsp; BUT, what do they DO?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&quot;rather than shutting it down&quot; .. and telling those infected to run the latest AV to clear it,, they said they were going to use it to &quot;send out repair codes&quot; to the&nbsp; &nbsp;infected computers to &quot;fix them&quot; ..... that was almost a million computers&nbsp; IIRC!<br /><br />And they just got their latest QUANTUM COMPUTER!&nbsp; Yes, a real &#039;quantum computer&#039; and it&#039;s big bro that&#039;s apparently 50x faster and able to crack GPG ... not easliy, BUT they now CAN ... but it wont be used to work out your orders or addresses!<br /><br />&nbsp; But if we ALL encrypt everthing important, we&#039;d bog then down with encrypted data they&#039;ll have No idea what it contains ... yet!<br /><br />And then tonight I saw a brief clip about DPR getting busted and a clean cut, smiling, good looking 30ish guy with a beard, who&nbsp; wasn&#039;t surrounded by cops or agents and seemed quite relaxed!<br /><br />&nbsp; Something about this just doesnt add up to me ... and it could be FAR STRANGER than we could imagine!!<br /><br /><br />Take care all<br /><br /><br />m m m motek

				My virtual machines crashed 2 times yesterday. It locked up the computer, so if it was an attack it was most likely a big fail.<br />If your computer hangs, make sure you turn it off instead of pushing the reset button. So there is no cyberwar malware residue in the memory. Not sure if it helps, but better safe than sorry. Don&#039;t need it to make it too easy for the crminal governments which arbitrarily attack people in other countries.

				Yeah I don&#039;t believe half of what I read in the media, so there&#039;s every chance that this hasn&#039;t gone down the way they&#039;re saying it has.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course they&#039;re spinning the arrest story, and there would be downright lies if the FBI are involved.&nbsp; All very dodgy....
