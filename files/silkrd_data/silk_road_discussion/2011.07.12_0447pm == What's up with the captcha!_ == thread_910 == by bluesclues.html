				I just spent *45 minutes* trying to log in to this site, triple checking the captcha every time. I probably got 50+ wrong before I could log in. <br /><br />What the hell? Why is it so hard? I&#039;m positive I entered everything in correctly every time, but the page would just reload like the captcha was wrong.

				Yer, I&#039;ve found that. <br /><br />But only took me about 5 mins before giving up and coming back later. Perhaps at times, the site is at maximum capacity and there&#039;s a sort of one-in / one-out policy going on. - I have no idea if websites work like that but just a guess.

				I believe the Captcha is case-sensitive. I also mix up the I and 1 frequently and it can be frustrating at times.

				Keep hitting Ctrl + (Ctrl and the plus button) It will blow up the captcha and make reading the case easy

				I HATE the captcha here - i usually have to do it three or four times before i actually get it right. And it is case-sensitive.

				Yeah its quite annoyng sometimes. I always confuse I and 1 also 0 and O. If understood correctly zero in the captcha has a line in the middle? Or maybe its Q dunno.

				Watch out about signing into a phishing site. Hidden Wiki and other places sometimes change the Silk Road link.<br />Then the phishers log your name and pass and then send you to a failed CAPTCHA page on Silk Road and then you log in normally on your second try.&nbsp; You should always either type in the address or use your own bookmark. <br />At least&nbsp; check your address bar for ian and the z6z.<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion<br /><br />my mnemonic:&nbsp; (In three parts)<br />ian crossed 6 palindrome F*ed up elk. <br />72 (is) un-lucky<br />almost at the end, don&#039;t forget the 4 Zs -2 of them so palindrome makes sense, 2 more at&nbsp; Z end.<br /><br />If you think you may have been phished, change your password. I recommend KeePass

				I believe the captcha has a time of validity too, so if you take too long it doesnt work.
