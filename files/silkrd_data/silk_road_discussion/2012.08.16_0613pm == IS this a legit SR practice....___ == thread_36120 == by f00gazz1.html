				So I know EBAY will pull yur listing if ya get caught...Ive seen a vendor chargin nuthin for product and 50-600 for shipping, depending on weight of order..In an attempt for what appears to screw SR outta FEES/Commision for being able to make bank at no cost or %&#039;age of transaction , all while exploiting the system setup based on honesty/trust and legitimacy.. Kinda pisses me off..Can anyone clear up ..and SR staff Pls, P.M. if ya want the vendors page...if not cool, But I look at it as thievery and the gateway behavior to full fledged&nbsp; hyjinx and shennanigans, And some customer one day out 100&#039;s in BitConz (yes bitconz)&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				I&#039;m almost 90% sure that shipping fee is not excluded from the SR Commision rate<br /><br />Vendors put all of the listing cost in the shipping costs for a few reasons:<br />Be able to have 1 particular listing, but multiple items listed under it.<br />This allows their products to be easier to browse<br />It prevents over spamming on SR. Instead of having 100 listings of the same item but different weights, or maybe different strains(weed)... they can have a single listing, where all their reviews will go under, with all their weights, etc etc. <br /><br />In my opinion it&#039;s a very smart way of doing things. It prevents SR from being clustered and helps buyers have a better time finding items they want

				I&#039;m fairly certain that shipping is excluded, seeing as how the listing price buyers see is including commission. Do shipping options have a pre/post commission option for when you set them?

				Shipping is excluded from commission, and vendors are certainly not allowed to put the entire price in the shipping cost. If you see it, message SR Support and they&#039;ll handle it.

I assumed the shipping costs would also go to commission, so I&#039;ve advised one or two vendors to use that to prevent spam.<br /><br />I|S, the fact that some people have used it list multiple weights shows the possible need for a weight-selector that would partly go into commissions. Would it be terribly difficult to add that? Perhaps as a checkbox-option when creating a new listing?

(If that&#039;s a legal transfer, assuming no charge and me not having done any business through it.)
