How the hell is someone that stupid even alive? If you&#039;re that dumb, you can&#039;t be safe to do business with. How do you use GPG? How do you keep your wallet safe? Is your drive encrypted? How do you use TOR? Are all your passwords on PostIt notes on the edge of your monitor, too? Can you walk and chew gum at the same time?<br /><br />If someone needs to be told to check for phishing on this site, then they are likely doing a great many other things wrong as well. If anything, I want a list of names who suspect being phished so I know never, ever to do business with them.<br /><br />I realize SR is trying to appeal to, and be usable by, the largest number of people possible. Not everyone knows how to computer very well. But, in this business, being stupid is dangerous. Being outrageously stupid is not something we should hand a crutch to. SR should present enough motivation that people learn and make an effort to stop being dumb as shit. Catering to it will only get us fucked. This isn&#039;t Wal Mart, our asses are on the line.

				One could make this URL:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.com<br /><br />My point being, I saw this warning when logging into SR. It makes no sense. If someone is trying to do business on SR and they&#039;re stupid enough to fall for phishing in such an obvious manner; they really, really, really do not belong here. They are most likely doing many other dangerously stupid things, too. I don&#039;t know any Vendor who wants to be exposed to someone that stupid. It&#039;s dangerous.

				I think you&#039;re being a bit harsh. After this place got mentioned in Wired and Gawker, there are stupid people here. Let&#039;s help them become as clever as you and me rather than leaving them to the sharks.<br /><br />Also a phished account could potentially present more security risks than a few stolen coins. Best to warn people there are phishing clone sites out there.

				This is why everyone with a mt. gox account needs to get a Yubikey.. It makes it IMPOSSIBLE to get into an account with out it.. I could post my username and password here and it would be totally safe..<br /><br />Its the best 29 bucks I&#039;ve ever spent..It generates a new 44 character password each time. Like Lasagna said, he doesn&#039;t know of any program or programmer that could break it...Im not technical at all, but from what Ive read about the yubikey it makes things uber safe..
