				The market&#039;s flooded for cannabis here anyways.<br /><br />How about you figure out how to punctuate and space out your sentences so people can read what you&#039;re saying?<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get the funds for a vendor account, I doubt you will be able to keep up with the shit that goes on here as a vendor.<br /><br />Please sell locally and come back prepared. Asking for donations is very unprofessional.

				Ill make it real easy to get them coins. Go buy a moneypak and I will sell you all the coins you need at market rate with no fees or anything. If you got the cash but don&#039;t have the coins its the perfect solution. Look me up on SR. Im sure I have enough coin laying around to get you started.

				SMH.................. North west Direct are doing great right now!! This guys came and have fully blown the Weed scene up! Unless you can keep up with these guys and the other god knows how many weed vendors i would suggest u not come on the scene. Youv already started off wrong. U want the community to give u 5 or more coins? Damn man your not asking for much are u? lol..<br /><br />If you are having trouble finding BTC.. Go sell all this Killer Bud u have, Sell a QP for a good price no one can say no to, Take your money buy a MoneyPak and then go through one of the BTC vendors on the Road. I think i even say where one guy is selling his coins 12 bucks each.. Why would people wanna invest in your account? Cause you gonna give some samples? Like i said North west Direct are Established Vendors in a month and they do Free Sample Fridays All the time.. So your pitch isnt really gonna cut it bro.. This is just the truth..

				In a way, it is good to see so much competition in one vertical...although I don&#039;t envy those that can&#039;t keep up with lower prices (due in part to increased legalization, I&#039;m sure).<br /><br />I was under the impression it&#039;s about ~500usd for a new vendor account, has it really jumped 3x+ again in such a short time?

This is what confused me.<br /><br />Bond<br />You are required to pay a bond when opening a seller&#039;s account that will be refunded to you after you have demonstrated that you are an asset to the Silk Road vendor community. To be eligible for a refund, you must have completed at least 30 transactions totaling $1,500 or more and have been a vendor for at least 6 weeks. To request a refund, send a message to vendor support after you have met these conditions. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee you will be granted a refund. All requests will be reviewed manually.

				Any good vendor is going to do $1500 worth of transactions in their first week or two. Come on guys, $1500/30 transactions = $50 per transaction. If you can&#039;t sell 30 $50 items, what the fuck are you doing vending?

				About the &quot;bond&quot;.&nbsp; One of the admins posted this a couple of days ago about bonding:&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;The 500.00 sellers fee is the bond. When&nbsp; you reach 1500.00 in sales and have 30 transactions and have been vending for 6 weeks, your eligible to ask us to review it to see if you qualify for your coins back.<br /><br />~Flush&quot;<br /><br />Here is the thread where s/he said it:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98709.msg696052#msg696052<br /><br />Hope this helps /wm
