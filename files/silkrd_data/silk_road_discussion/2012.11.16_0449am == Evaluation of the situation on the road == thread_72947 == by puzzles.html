				Ok so i&#039;ve seen alot(ALOT) of paranoia on the forums recently about what DPR might be upto. Wild speculations about DPR handing over to law enforcement, emptying SR of thousands of BTC during downtime and the list goes on. Up until now i havnt really bought into the idea that he&#039;s upto anything sinister, i still dont but i see where people are coming from. Im pretty mutual on the matter and think no assumptions should be made until we know something has happened<br /><br />- First update from DPR after downtime was that during a 24 hour break from managing the road the site had problems of some sort and he was the only person who could fix the problem.<br /><br />- Then we were told the &quot;maintenance&quot; was planned, contradicting what we were told before <br /><br />**Heres where thing get a bit shifty**<br /><br />-&nbsp; Then rumours came that 12,000 btc were seen moving from sr addresses (not sure on whether this is true or not so not letting it influence my thoughts, if anyone can confirm truth behind this would be nice)<br /><br />- Site comes up for the first time, only to sellers for a short period. When open to buyers withdrawls were unavailable while deposits were being dealt with (hmm....)<br /><br />- A few missing coins are being talked about on the forums. Funds that have been withdrawn from the road are not appearing in peoples wallets<br /><br /><br />I should add that i personally havnt had any problems, my deposit went through fast enough and was spent short after so no problems there.<br />Not making any judgement on this until some events actually unfold and proof is given instead of rumors <br /><br /><br />

				I figure I might contribute something before I go to bed. There are several users who are having difficulty depositing bitcoins. Some as long ago as the 9th to as short as 4 hours. Here are some threads documenting this discrepancy in full detail:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72587.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71854.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72929.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71890.0<br /><br />If you look at the end of DPR&#039;s update thread, you&#039;ll also find some users complaining about missing bitcoins. There&#039;s not much we can say at this point. I think it was Lao Tzi who said &quot;no judgement, only obsevervation.&quot; Well, it might not have been him, but looking at a situation for what it is instead of attaching your own fears and emotions is always the best way to proceed. <br />

				Lol withdrawals aren&#039;t missing people are just pissed it&#039;s taking a little longer than usual. Withdrew yesterday morning and didn&#039;t get it until this morning. That&#039;s a long wait, but it still went through. The maximum wait is up to 72 hours. There&#039;s just a bunch of kids and tweekers on here that freak when they don&#039;t get their instant gratification.

I got a message from SR Support 22hrs ago and replied immediately and now they haven&#039;t read any messages and therefore not replied to any either. Meanwhile, people are doing all sorts of shit on here but our accounts have nothing!<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a deposit that was tiny since it&#039;s been back up and that&#039;s worked, so where&#039;s my 150 that were sent on the 10th is the big question?<br /><br />I&#039;m evidently not a kid or a *tweaker* I was helping a mate out with depositing that now it&#039;s blown up in my face leaving me with a debt. At one stage I was using it as my depository which &quot;is lucky I pulled out&quot; (no pun intended) when I did because I can see where my accounts been robbed over a few days.<br /><br />

				As they say in law school:<br /><br />It&#039;s not what you know, it&#039;s what you can prove in court.<br /><br />If you have actual evidence of this, then I&#039;m sorry; but your&nbsp; [many] threads have lead me to believe otherwise.

Assuming DPR has his reason to not activate withdrawls and his intentions are pure, surely you shouldnt panic when they dont work. Admittedly, WHY withdrawls are down is another question but like i said i am assuming he has a legitmate reason because i have no reason to believe otherwise. He has done his job, kept us updated and kept to his time frame as best possible, and has said himself that if there are any problems to contact support to try and resolve it.&nbsp;

				Withdrawals are working fine for me .. did not even take much longer than usual.<br /><br />For me this is more than enough proof that DPR has no intention of stealing any BTC... if he was going to steal our coins he would have done so already and would certainly not allow withdrawals..<br />
