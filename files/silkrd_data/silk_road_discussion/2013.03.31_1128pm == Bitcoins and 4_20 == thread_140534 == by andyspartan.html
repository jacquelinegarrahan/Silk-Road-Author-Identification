				Yo, sup all, Obviously yall all know the price of bitcoins right now is almost at $100. And like 2 and a half months ago it was at $13 so with that said im am more than positive this has been a huge benefit several sellers. But the bitcoin&#039;s price has gone up due to several reason such as Cyprus gov. is trying to put a law that they can take a percentage of money from people&#039;s banks so the people have decided to take out all their money and buy things such as gold and Bitcoins. Also a similar situation has occurred in japan. People are starting to see bitcoins as a safe asset which is not a smart choice (well its your choice but im speaking by facts) also a couple other factors are effecting it but not as much. So these drug dealers on the road should have seen a large increase of profits due to exchanging their bitcoins for USD. And since that and since its March 31... soon to be April and the day we all love, 4/20. Sadly enough I missed out on silk road last year on 4/20 but its life. Pretty much all im saying since the profits sellers made recently they should soon offer bomb ass deals on cannabis products closer to 4/20 for 4/20. Hope this year it can be better than last and more sells are made.
