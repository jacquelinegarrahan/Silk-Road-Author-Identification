				In the wiki for sellers here on SR it states to ALWAYS use the escrow system and not to try to go around it.<br /><br />Specifically in the Do&#039;s and Dont&#039;s it says<br />DONT -Don&#039;t ever ask for payment out of escrow. <br /><br />If that is the case then why does SR allow vendors to make listings and require FE?&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t they take those listings down as it is outside of SR&#039;s terms?

				Because buyers can try and scam sellers just as easily as sellers can try and scam buyers. Most decent buyers have a 5-10 TX policy where anyone with above those amounts of purchases can use escrow, you have to earn your stripes as a vendor to be able to do this and have 35+ successful transactions before you can ask for FE or even have people finalize within 3 days of dispatch.<br /><br />It&#039;s fair on everyone this way.

				Because there&#039;s nothing to stop people from continuously making new accounts and saying that their order never showed up.<br /><br />I don&#039;t require FE because I use delivery confirmation on all orders. But when I was using envelopes I did require FE for new buyers.

				Requiring FE is for the lazy who just don&#039;t want to deal with scammers. But the sellers need to know it is more than just giving them BTC upfront, it is giving them complete control of the whole situation. Therefor is no need to describe items accurately, no incentive to keep sellers honest about their product and on top of their game. I despise FE and think it is disgusting. A good vendor does not need to take the lazy route and if they are good enough they won&#039;t have to accept new customers at all, that is if they decide not to be not lazy about it. The least these vendors could do is&nbsp; put a stat requirement for no FE early. Why would you require a buyer (especially as a NEW seller), who has most likely been here longer than you, has a lot of transactions and 0/0 to FE? This is why I love and respect vendors like CN. Proof is right there that great sellers simply don&#039;t need FE early.<br /><br />Now with that said I understand the reasons for doing it and am not saying they are in no way justifiable. What I am saying is that to me, as a honest buyer, who has spent quite a bit, FE early is disrespectful to me because it disregards my stats and loyalty as a buyer, as a customer. That is just how I feel as a pure buyer. I will always give my money to the seller I respect, especially return money.<br /><br />

Why should I be restricted from buying just because you and the other 75% of members buying small amounts can&#039;t make a decision for yourselves not to FE?

				I am sick of people writing all of this crap about finalizing early. Nobody held a gun to their head and made them do it. There are some situations where finalizing early is needed, and that situation will be decided by the vendor and the customer, not you ranting on the forums. If either party is not satisfied with any of the terms they do not have to participate. That is it. Why is that so hard for some of you to understand and why do you feel the need to complain about it so much? Did you click the finalize button when you shouldn&#039;t have?&nbsp; <br /><br />

This is a great community we&#039;ve built up here, and a little maturity wouldn&#039;t go astray if you intend to contribute positively to it. If you have anything worthwhile to add to the conversation, other than throwing insults at an anonymous person over the internet, I&#039;ll gladly respond to you.<br /><br />However, feeling the ever so slight desire to point out the fallacy in your recent tirade, I&#039;m a &quot;bulk buyer&quot; by your own logic in that I spend over £100 per transaction (which is the ceiling that you provided for personal use buyers) unless it&#039;s for personal amounts of drugs such as ephedrine and viagra, or items from other categories.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Either way you look at it the same argument can me made on both ends. The main issue here is TRUST! Vendor finds it hard to trust buyers and buyers don&#039;t want to risk to FE even if the vendor appears to be legit. How can we really ever know? No, really. For example, I&#039;m still deciding to make my first purchase here on SR but I still can&#039;t pick who to buy it from (snow). One (snow) vendor has on his main page &quot;FE Required&quot; with no tracking option and on top of that offers NO REFUND. Now, how the fuck is that fair to any buyer here? I mean he does have a lot of transactions and I honestly don&#039;t give a fly about the feedback system as I believe it is fundamentally flawed. But like someone wrote if you don&#039;t like the vendors policy just move on to the next seller. The fact SR allows this tactic it completely opens the can of worms on both ends then. SR should apply a strict 100% 24/7 policy rule (whatever they think is right/fair) and no questions asked. It is obvious SR tends to learn more toward the vendor but that&#039;s not hard to figure out why. In another words, even here politics exist.
