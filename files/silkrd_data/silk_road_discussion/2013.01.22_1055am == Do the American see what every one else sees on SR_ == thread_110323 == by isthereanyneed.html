				Just a thought every time I search for weed and hash all the vendors are from the UK more or less and all the most popular items are all from UK do we have 2 versions of SR or do the Americans see what we see just considering how many UK vendors there are and hardly any from the US it would make more sense to me if there were 2 versions of SR?<br /><br />

				When you click on Cannabis, as an example, and the results come up, make sure the &#039;domestic&#039; box at the top of&nbsp; isn&#039;t ticked and you will see vendors from all over that ship to your location. :)

				Yeah tried it with and with out and the majority of the time the UK has like say 70% of the weed/hash market, just a bit mad from an outsiders point of view they will be thinking fuck me the UK must be amazing for weed and hash (take me back to the summer of 1997 best hash around) I mean dont get me wrong we get good shit here but you got to look, I would of thought the Netherlands or the USA would of been NO1 for weed/hash but they are red flag countries so who knows.

				When you set your profile up on SR marketplace you designate a home country and with this home country is how the domestic check box determines what listings are domestic to you.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
