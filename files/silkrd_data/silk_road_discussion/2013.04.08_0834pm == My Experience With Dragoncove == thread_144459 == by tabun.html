				I am very new to the Road, and because of this, I lurked around for a week before making my first purchase, which was based on:<br />1. Product Desired/Price (of course)<br />2. Vendor Rating (Length of Time on the ROAD, # of Transactions, etc.)<br />3. Feedback from customers in the forums<br /><br />I did FE because of his reputation, so I wanted to give proper feedback now that I have received my order. I ordered late Thursday afternoon and OFFERED to FE. His communications were quick and he asked me to go ahead and FE, which I did. The next day, I got a message with my Tracking Number. Saturday the package made it to the closest hub in my area. Sunday was, of course, a dead day for the USPS. Monday morning, I had my package in hand!<br /><br />I have not ordered H from any other vendors on the Road, so I can only compare the quality to that of the local stuff where I live and to what I used to get in Dallas. Honestly, a TENTH (one point) of his product is equal to about a half gram of my local stuff, which is also a beige colored powder.&nbsp; That same tenth is equal to around a quarter gram of BTH I used to get in Dallas, with the exception of the occasional batch of &quot;Purple Glass&quot; that came through from time to time.<br /><br />The weight was slightly OVER the advertised weight, which is always an added plus! DC is an honest vendor, scoring 5/5 in all categories except stealth, which wasn&#039;t an issue for me. He had it double vacuum sealed, in an envelope, which was between stiff pieces of cardboard, and THEN inserted in a Priority Mail envelope. It was packaged for safe and secure delivery 100%, but if opened by anyone other than myself, there would be no question as to what was inside.<br /><br />I am probably going to try one of the BTH vendors such as NOD for variety, but I can say that as long as DC has a listing for H, he is my new GO-TO-GUY! Thanks DC!

				Dragoncove - and all vendors - really appreciate it if you post reviews like this one on their personal review threads over in the Rumor Mill or in the collective lists for drugs like heroin and weed. sorry I can&#039;t be arsed to put the links in here, but just navigate over there or do a search and I&#039;m sure DC and anyone else from whom you buy will be glad you did.
