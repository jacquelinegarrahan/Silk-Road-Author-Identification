				I&#039;ve never even been on that site. It always looked sketchy and I never needed anything I couldn&#039;t get here.<br /><br />How is compared to SR? More or less secure? More or less likely to get ripped-off? Or about the same for both?

				BMR is great, many vendors prefer BMR. Purest is a well know H vendor who has sold there for years. And now the rest of us are going there and some are going to sheep, when sheep crashes it will be BMR or something new. not a place with a sheep logo that happens to have the same backend as atlantis. But from personal experience, BMR is the go to, it has withstood the test of time. They will upgrade as more people begin to use it.<br /><br />Also deepbay has never been heard of, by anybody. Dont fall for that.

				BMR is a community of populations, just like the silk road.<br /><br />Check BMR&#039;s forums for feedback.<br /><br /><br />You could also check my signature for an established silk road vendor, The Scurvy Crew. We welcome new buyers looking to up their rating by buy hash and opium.

				I used BMR last year when SR went down for over a week. <br /><br />Only positives to report, successful transactions with multiple vendors.<br /><br />With the recent events I&#039;ll be keeping my head down for quite some time... I suspect a lot of others will do the same. <br /><br />BMR is notorious for scammers though, dunno how overplayed this was when SR was in full swing; I suspect this was a rumor generated by people who had a vested interest in SR at the time. <br /><br />My biggest concern right now is security. Seems logically that if SR could be taken down with such ease, and Atlantis closing it&#039;s doors that BMR won&#039;t be far behind. I could be wrong though, only time will tell.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				I have done some vending in BMR in the past. Not much, but my experience is positive. I never encountered any scammers, only one customer ever caused any trouble but that was no biggie in the end and I ended up doing business with them again.<br /><br />One suggestion though, turn off the auto-encryption and encrypt your address manually, you&#039;ll sleep better at nights knowing it was truly end-to-end encrypted.<br /><br />SR came down so easily because DPR turned out to be very stupid. I hope the people at BMR learn from DPR:s mistakes...

				Hey guys, Ive never used anything outside of SR and these forums.. So im pretty much freaking out right now.. Not cuz im an addict, but I do love my share of festis with psychedelics.&nbsp; Well anyways my questions is... If BMR is no longer accepting people to join in what can someone like me do?&nbsp; And if a new SR does come that needs recommendations.. I havent really made friends along the way to be like hey can you refer me....<br /><br />Is there any way to provide links? Or is this asking for too much?&nbsp; I feel so... useless..

				Truly amazing that so many people blindly followed DPR. <br /><br />With the saga of the Ddos attack etc etc. <br /><br />I was one of them, to think he got done so easily is remarkable.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe he was living in the USA. First thing I would have done would have been to move to a US non-extradition country

They must be swamped with people from SR migrating over. I wonder how long it will be before they open registrations back up again. I did get on sheep. That&#039;s site is sooooo low-rent though!
