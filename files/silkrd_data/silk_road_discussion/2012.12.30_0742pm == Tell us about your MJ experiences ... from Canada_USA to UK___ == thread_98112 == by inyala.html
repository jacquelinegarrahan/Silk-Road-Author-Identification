				Hey guys recently had a free sample of LSD shipped from Canada and was amazed how quickly it reached UK over the Xmas period.<br /><br />So this had me thinking ...... what about trying some MJ from that neck of the woods?<br />( buy weed regularly from trusted domestic UK vendors and an excellent SA vendor - not huge amounts anything from 1-30g depending on price as we smoke lots!!!)<br /><br />Just wondering about your experiences with success rates and recommended vendors?<br />Have been looking on the forums for a couple hours now and not found much so if you have any helpful links ...<br />

				I&#039;m prepared for the onslaught of -karma for this, but come on dude. There is a whole section of the forums dedicated to JUST this, pretty much. This isn&#039;t it.

				only thing i tried, was getin some bomb ol&#039; afghani hash, from SMILE MARKET.<br /><br />and since it s the first class snail mail, i think it makes its way alot quicker and easier than say a box with a couple grams...<br /><br />i rather order 5 grams at a time then press my luck with a box

				Thanks for those links ^^^ <br /><br />Quite familiar with forums actually esp the Rumour Mill&nbsp; and Good Cannabis Vendors Reviews but it&#039;s difficult to gauge success rates for UK buyers.
