				SR is here for life.&nbsp; This is only a website, there is always going to be promblems with shit like this.&nbsp; Hackers is a main concern with sites like this. Nothing to worry about only hackers that DPR I heard I read had hired the best It people to fix these promblem for good so none of that shit is going to happen.&nbsp; (Stay Thirsty my friends).

				Well said!&nbsp; The fundamentals of the system (i.e. escrow, customer feedback, customer statistics, PGP encryption, BTC usage) are simple but effective.&nbsp; Makes for a robust environment.&nbsp; Although, as I understand it, the darknet is not immune to infiltration (and I mean REAL infiltration and not just a small time SQL attack), those fundamentals should serve to protect our identity from these more experienced hackers.&nbsp; And really, the risk of dealing with people over the web is much safer than dealing with people IRL, as you&#039;ve mentioned.&nbsp; As long as you take the necessary precautions.&nbsp; <br /><br />And uhh...&nbsp; yea....&nbsp; dunno what this 420 character&#039;s problem is.&nbsp; For some reason, he fails to see SR as a whole on only seems to focus on the &quot;uninspired use of acquiring illicit items over the mail.&quot;&nbsp;
