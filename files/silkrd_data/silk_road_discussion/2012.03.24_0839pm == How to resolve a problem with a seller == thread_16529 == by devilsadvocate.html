				I am looking for help in resolving a problem with a seller, a very high profile seller with a very good rep.&nbsp; <br /><br />About a month ago, I placed an order with this seller.&nbsp; I have had numerous great transactions with this seller I should mention.&nbsp; They sent me a different item than what I had ordered.&nbsp; No big deal, shit happens, so I contacted them 26 days ago and told them.&nbsp; 23 days ago I received a message confirming that they had shipped the wrong items and to let them know what the order was and he would make it right.&nbsp; 13 days ago he stated that he would need my address again as SR or DPR now encoded all account numbers.&nbsp; I sent the info and I still have not received anything.&nbsp; Since this time, I have sent 2 more PMs to the seller asking about resolution.&nbsp; No response, and now it&#039;s been about a month since the initial transaction.&nbsp; Like I said, I had numerous excellent transactions prior to this one.&nbsp; I just want what I ordered.<br /><br />Any help or ideas are most appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Has this vendor been making any transactions during the time he hasn&#039;t responded? What&#039;s his feedback like? Have you researched his name on the forums?

				Well, if his seller page indicates this, then I would probably try the patience route.&nbsp; How long has it been since he was last seen?&nbsp; Does it corroborate any update on his seller&#039;s page?<br /><br />Most of the vendors here are probably slinging shit irl...&nbsp; Maybe the shit hit the fan, who knows.&nbsp; The ones that care will make it right, but not if someone starts freaking out about not getting their stamp bag and threatening&nbsp; to write about it in the forums.&nbsp; You withheld a name, and are asking for advice, so I&#039;m not saying that you would...&nbsp; But a lot of disputes end up this way, never really ending well, but still entertaining to read about.<br /><br />I hope I don&#039;t sound like an asshole- just that I really believe in working towards a resolution that&#039;s agreeable to both parties instead of one that can only end in a pissing contest.&nbsp; The more compromising each party remains, the smoother the resolution.<br /><br />The cooler head prevails...

				It sounds like the vendor may have just gotten caught up with personal shit. The best you could do is probably wait patiently and check up on this vendor&#039;s activity. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll work itself out.

				The seller was last seen 3 days ago, but has stated they&#039;re taking a short hiatus to reorganize.&nbsp; What bothers me is that if he was here 3 days ago, he could have taken 5 minutes to reply to my PM.&nbsp; Communication is key.&nbsp; And it&#039;s been 5 weeks since the initial transaction for which they admitted they screwed up.&nbsp;

				I had a recent scenario much like this, and I took the time to PM the seller (99.8% seller review on a ton of transactions) and they no longer had the product in that was shipped to a different address. After about 3 1/2 weeks and sporadic, civil communication the seller asked if I&#039;d agree to do a 50/50 split for the product, did a custom order for me and should be in transit as of Wednesday.&nbsp; <br /><br />So long as you do not come at the seller sideways you should be good to go and get the product that you initially ordered- especially if they have admitted guilt already. <br /><br />Good luck man.
