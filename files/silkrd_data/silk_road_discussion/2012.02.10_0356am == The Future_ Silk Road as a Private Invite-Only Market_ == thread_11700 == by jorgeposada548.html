				Hello Roaders,<br /><br />With all the talk in the press about SR these days - is anyone feeling like it should be made an invite-only site similar to Demonoid, whereas existing users can have a limited amount of invites for new members?<br /><br />It goes without saying that the ones that have been here since the ground floor had to jump through a few hoops to figure out how to get everything to work, but nowadays, it&#039;s as simple as watching a 10 minute youtube video. So simple that I think it could one day pose a problem to the safety of the community.<br /><br />Obviously I have no say, I&#039;m not a mod, and there&#039;s nothing I can do to change anything around here. Nonetheless, I thought I would bring it up and hear what everyone has to say on the issue.<br /><br />Example: http://bitcoinmedia.com/bbc-5-live-investigates-silk-road-and-bitcoins/

				Frankly, I have to say that I&#039;m incredibly surprised at the overall backlash from a single idea regarding safety and further anonymity for such a revolutionary market and its users.<br /><br />Anyone who has been around here for more than two seconds has likely seen an extreme growth in the number of transactions happening within the past year. For the more major sellers on here it will only become more difficult to mask themselves as more and more people, including LE, get actively involved.<br /><br />Obviously it goes without saying that it&#039;s understood that everyone knows the risks and the stakes going into this, and should do as much research beforehand to prevent possible negative outcomes.<br /><br />I am not on any one side advocating for a private or an open market, I am merely suggesting it should be an pondered given recent events and the MAJOR increase in popularity. This popularity won&#039;t cease, it is clear that it will continue.

				Yes, this has been discussed before, but, the Road has never been as large as it is now.<br /><br />It&#039;s inspiring to see all the fighters here - fighting for their freedom of choice. This is a great thing and commendable. But I also think it might be clear stupidity not even to consider the repercussions of a market like this growing so big within the next few months, or years.<br /><br />All it takes is for one 14yr old kid to get their hands on some shit, take too much, then it&#039;s all over the news with Tor and Silk Road as the ones to blame after the parents search the computer. <br /><br />Am I paranoid, maybe? Is it going to make or break my life in the end, absolutely not. But it may make or break what you are all fighting so admirably for.<br /><br />Having been around long enough to see markets crushed, and once very little known unscheduled substances deemed illegal by becoming too well-known and too easily available, I think people should at least give a hybrid open/private system some thought.

If anything, I think that the world would improve drastically if all this stupid talk about drugs / everything like it just came to and end. Unfortunately the majority of wealthy assholes would rather keep things as they are because the &quot;criminals&quot; that are kept in jail for serious &quot;crimes&quot; that hurt no one are the ones who probably have the brain power capable to eliminate them from their positions at the metaphorical mountain top (plus who&#039;s going to really get a high level politician in trouble for doing drugs anyway? fuck, throughout history they have been pardoned by American presidents all the time, essentially giving them &quot;get out of jail free&quot; cards).<br /><br />As a scientist / curious human being, I&#039;ve learned that all of the political propaganda put forth is a driving machine in every country I&#039;ve ever visited. Most people in the general public truly believe that &quot;drugs are bad&quot; and think it would ruin society completely if a market like SR existed in the public. This is obviously not true and creates a terrible underground market where people do really get hurt by using drugs that are not the actual drugs they were looking for (but didn&#039;t know) or they just had no idea how to use that drug properly - because they were not educated on how to via harm reduction education.<br /><br />The world is a fucking joke as it stands, so if any politicians are out there reading this that aren&#039;t just in it for the money, but for legitimate change, please speak the fuck up for a change in regards to things that people actually get affected by on a daily basis (like recreational drug use, prostitution, etc.) - not wars against fucking citizens for having a little fun in this short little thing of ours called life.

Hint: the opposite of what you just said, is true.<br /><br />People in this thread are not out mock you. They&#039;re here to help you. People who invested time and effort to get a feel for what SR is all about, they&#039;re helping you to get on board. Sadly you&#039;re a bit slow to figure it out. I suggest you delve into the prior threads and look at the resolutions they brought about. Acknowledge some of the history of this topic so that people can see you&#039;re serious.. because all we see now is a new guy (posing as an old guy in disguise) who&#039;s feeling all exposed and insecure, as we&#039;ve all seen 100x before. People been there.. we all have, but you gotta let go. Surrender. Do the ego death. SR ain&#039;t going nowhere, regardless media attention. regardless the heat. If Sr goes private it won&#039;t be because of whimpy threads like this, it will because DPR made the call. Say &#039;NO&#039; to fear. Face your insecurities head on. Surrender to the will of the SR. It doesn&#039;t mean &quot;don&#039;t share your ideas&quot;, but it means... know when to let go. I&#039;ve had plenty of ideas gone by the wayside here at SR. It gets easier with time, you will no doubt agree later on.

				What a great idea.....to figure out how to government-proof SR.<br /><br />First one needs to examine just what government is and just why it would ever be a threat to people producing and trading in the first place.<br /><br />Government has many modes but one stands out------power to override individual choice.<br />In today&#039;s world, at least the one most on this site come from I&#039;m sure, the mode that power operates under is the guise of protecting us all through the power of collective choice.<br />Just 3 wolves and a sheep choosing lunch in actual operation of course. Once any mob gets to choose what others may do a fork ov different incentives is create and the behavoir follows more or less predictably.<br /><br />Some, lets call them the dreamers, choose what gives them the warmest fuzzies about making a difference. They lend their will to the collective gun shoot any not trying to make the world fair for all. They would take beauty and give to the ugly, take tallness and give to the short, whatever they could to make themselves believe they were helping make humans equal while ignoring humans can never be equal in anything but the right to choose for themselves from the choices presented to them at any given moment.<br /><br />Others, the lazy dogs as they are more of a domesticated pet than a true wolf,&nbsp; don&#039;t care. They care about nothing but what will lead to an easier path. Their choices have no principle and no consequence other than finding the least resistive path.<br />They lend their support to anyone promising that end, jumping from ship to ship along the way.<br /><br />Still others, the schemers, figure out how to form groups to sway the less attentive into unwillingly doing their bidding for them. They choose to persuade the other 2 wolves (or the dogs more commonly) that the sheep is looking particularly tasty at the moment and hope that if they are persistent the dogs who really don&#039;t much care to decide for themselves will just go along as it is easier than individual, original thought and choice. <br /><br />This works great and IS the essence OP (and maybe the true, and purposeful intention of a lot of OPs here) if you ask me.<br />Quit sowing the seeds of short sighted, self centered greed here in a principled, long visioned agorist community. Even if a critical mass is achieved and enough ignorant people fall for it......SR won&#039;t.<br /><br />Of course I could type forever on this subject.....how culture drives the will of the masses and how culture itself is shaped by a handful of real actors among dogs and how democracy and it&#039;s stepchild universal suffrage is the greatest evil ever dressed up as virtue but I won&#039;t.

				well my thoughts <br /><br />So far I enjoy the market place and The forums.For some reason some people get scammed and they want to lynch people right away and BAN them if this can be proven then thats what should be done.As for this site and Others like this one operate for us to enjoy and shop and hock our wares.If every site like this was a invite only club I personnaly believe there would probably limited members as These senior members would only invite their clients to shop their wares.I am a new member and love the idea of being able to shop for whatever I am interested in this place is like being ing a shopping mall You can look at everything and purchase what you want.<br /><br />&nbsp; I have been busted for dealing drugs a couple times and I only sell to people I trust I don&#039;t look for new buyers I sell to the ones I have known for many years THIS IS CALLED PARANOID on my behalf but also being careful anyways if you stop people from joining we will be in a state of paranoia which really sucks.<br /><br />SR must get a good per centage of the sales so why should they cut off their own hand and not make any money when they seem to have things under control.Yes maybe they have to do a better scam list and review members that are a risk of being a straight out thief.I think they supply a great service for anybody to use <br /><br />BigBill6778
