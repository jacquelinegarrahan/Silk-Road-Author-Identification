				What does one do when they find a vendor with good feedback and want to order from them, but when they come to the forums<br />to search for info on them there isn&#039;t any.&nbsp; I have searched and searched for info on a certain vendor and I have not found<br />a single post.&nbsp; But the feedback on the main site is all recent and all good. <br /><br />Take a chance?&nbsp; I always try to perform my due diligence.&nbsp; I suspect it is bad form to come and ask about specific vendors<br />by name right?&nbsp;

				Well, in all honesty I am asking this after the fact.&nbsp; I did search and looked and looked for any info, but found nothing.<br />I did the purchase anyways as all the other vendors who have what I am looking for are gone until the new year<br />or just out all together.<br /><br />He has been here for a little while and is not a brand new vendor.&nbsp; Has a bit of sales and I can only imagine<br />that if things were bad that someone by now would have said something.&nbsp; I guess I am deducing that <br />because of the length of time and the good feedback with nothing on the forum that it is ok to buy from him.<br /><br />Now I am thinking that might might be a rookie mistake...&nbsp; I know they can make their own feedback and <br />get around the system that way.<br /><br />I guess I will live and learn...&nbsp; again...

				iv taken a few risks on vendors with no info on the forums, iv also noticed when u search a name sometimes it will say no results then try again and it will show, weird i know...But Long as you stay in the escrow your good.....Iv got over a dozen transactions and not all i have researched on the forums but most i do, depending on what kinda drug im getting.. If its pain pills im not to worried about it long as their rating is good and feedback, kinda hard to fake that.. You should be good though, im actually waiting on someone right now who as far as iv looked cant find anything on him but he has 100% and over 20 sells, but iv been waiting since last monday,but it was sent 1st class so im adding that plus holidays..All others have come through..Good lluck and remember NEVER FE unless its Subsandaddy

				It also depends on where in the forums you are . . .&nbsp; if you have been reading something in the Silk Road Discussion portion of the forum and do a search, it will only search that portion of the forum, whereas if you go to the first page of the forums &amp; search, you will get ALL the forum areas searched.<br /><br /><br />NCK

				I&#039;m a relatively new vendor, have great feedback on orders but I rarely, if ever, post on the forums. I started a single thread for people to provide feedback on me but last time I checked, there was nothing there.

				I would wager a lot of business comes from listings in the sig, not just from someone logging onto SR. It&#039;s a no-brainer, which is why almost every vendor here has them under every post. When you know which vendor is which are you more likely or less likely to buy? I&#039;ve seen FB from EnterTheMatrix and Limetless on these forums that you just can&#039;t replicate on the main SR. Means a lot more when it&#039;s coming from here because it&#039;s possible to see who provided the FB, not just some silly ILOVEFUCKTARTS99 says vendor1 is GREAAAAATTTT!!!! Or HBJBWJ&amp;(&amp;(Y*GIDY@GOGD*G#*G1995 says vendor 2 is OH MY GOD WHAT A GREAT VENDOR! MARRY THIS GUY HE&#039;S AWESOOOMMMMEE!!!!! like you sometimes get at BMR. I kid you not, that&#039;s how some vendors talk about themselves when they&#039;re pretending to be customers. Just the way it is, make the time if it&#039;s possible, it&#039;s worth it. <br /><br />Drive safely.

				what a strange idea....want to buy from a vendor with good feedback and because the guy is not on a forum doubt him.<br />I am a vendor, very good feedback (100) rating 300 sales and never are here nor does my customers need to say anything about me here. All goes smooth, no hassle etc. I think most people has better things to do then talk here .....<br />The reason I am here now is that i wanted to see if others have also problems login in., <br />Its getting worse and worse and it is difficult to really give service to your customers when they have to wait a day for reply because SR is not !!! working.<br />Need to be patient?....trying for 3 hours now....irritating shit<br />

				With 300+ 100% you obviously don&#039;t need the forums to convince customers; you&#039;re doing more than okay. Word may gotten around on the forums without you even knowing. I don&#039;t visit the vendor feedback threads as much as others so I probably missed it too. The FB system&#039;s a little different here than on BMR; I think they&#039;re clamping down on that. We&#039;ve suggested they try a more SR style approach to provide more transparency in trading. But even on SR false FB can happen with fake accounts and so forth, even if not to same degree.<br /><br />Anyway. I think SR should have a listings link so buyers can search for a vendor and have their listings come ^. Presently, I can only message them, which isn&#039;t much help. Don&#039;t know why you can&#039;t get on to SR. Worked fine for me today. If it times out I just get a new identity, sometimes speeds it ^. Piece out. Drive safely.
