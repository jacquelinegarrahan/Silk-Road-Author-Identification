				Recently for the first time in my time vending on the road, a customer stated i sent him duds, with only a few 25i-NBOMe dosed blotters in the whole 50x sheet. Now i&#039;m very sure in my technique in laying NBOMe, i&#039;m ruthlessly careful while producing them as to reduce the margin for error between tabs. Yet for the first time i&#039;m being told i&#039;ve not dosed half a sheet. I know that isnt true but i gave him the benefit of the doubt and reimbursed him some blotters.<br /><br />And again today he received his second order from me and i get the same message about messing up my dosing and has threatened to report me. I gave him my thoughts on what he said, and i clearly stated there is no way he is being reimbursed this time as its obvious he is just trying to get some free stuff. He claims to have got 44 dosed blotters in 2 orders of 50 blotters. Both times he messaged me the same day stating exactly how many were dosed and how many were duds. Lets just say he&#039;s done 22 dosed ones each time, thats 26.4mg of 25i per sitting..... He&#039;s also messaged me both times straight after receiving, he messaged me today at 1pm. Now how is that possible?<br /><br />I&#039;ll say again i&#039;ve not had one report of bad dosing, even between tabs, let alone sheets. <br /><br />Last time i saw a topic like this the vendor was accused of scamming, i&#039;ve been as honest as i can here and i&#039;m posting this so you can give your thoughts, whatever they may be. <br /><br />Thanks

				yeah that sounds too much to eat. <br /><br />sounds like a scammer!<br /><br />the only way he could test which one is dosed and which one isn&#039;t would be<br />&nbsp;to sell it local, rely on customer reports&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(no way he sold it that fast local)<br />or <br />reagent test every tab ( this would destroy the hits. why would anyone do that?) <br /><br /><br /><br />

				maybe he&#039;s swallowing the tabs, I think NBOME&#039;s arent so active as the stomach acid destroys the chemical, and the only real way to dose is sublingually or to put it between the upper lip and the gums

				My thoughts exacty valakki. + Its not like he&#039;s a trusted customer, i believe his first purchase was from me, i know it was definitely below 5 because he was required to FE. on his second he was above 5 so we stayed in escrow. <br /><br />@sofish<br />Thanks man good thinking. Would be funny if that was the case ::) I&#039;ll message him now<br /><br />&nbsp;+1 for both of you :)

				He&#039;s probably not dosing correctly (swallowing them or not holding them in his mouth long enough) or he&#039;s on meds that cancel their effects (SSRIs).

				This all sounds rather fishy! How in the hell does he know he had 22 out of a sheet of 50 that were improperly dosed? If he is somehow testing them and has that option available, I really doubt he would be buying nbome of the silk road - he would know to get it from china or wherever and make up his own. <br /><br />If he is handing out the sheet at a party and a lot of people are saying that it isnt working (ie give 25 people 2 tabs each and 22 said it didnt work) then I would say those 22 people need to be told how to properly dose nbome. We all know how, but does he?&nbsp; The other option is he is selling them as acid locally and that would be how they are selling so fast, but people who are experienced in acid are coming back to him with complaints. I think a couple of mates got sold nbome recently as acid and that must really suck as they had no effect as they swallowed and chewed.&nbsp; I have to admit its why I like tyler durdens snuff caps, there is no passing them off as acid. Even if most local people dont even seem to know whats in them or care they still know its not acid but know what to expect and love it for that reason.<br /><br />Best of luck rectifying this anyways. Just my 2 cents worth.

I mean who&#039;s at home at 12 when the postman comes, goes to a party, done/sold them all, and is back home by 1 to reply. Fishy to say the least :P<br /><br />Jheez i can stand people who sell it as acid, only happened to me once and was given my money back after because i&#039;m very familiar with nbomes and within a few minutes of dropping i went and found the guy. Biggest problem of all is danger. You can ingest as much lucy as you want, it wont kill you if you dont kill yourself, but its not the same with nbome, care needs to be taken and i do my best to provide it whenever possibe. At least educating people. Would you believe a customer bought 100 tabs and later messaged me saying they thought 25i-NBOMe was another name for acid?&nbsp; ::)

				that&#039;s a buyer scam if ever i&#039;ve seen one! the timing says it all. he&#039;s already got double what he paid for, tell him he should be grateful for your generosity so far and call it a day. get an established vendor on here to put him on the suspicious buyers list if possible so other vendors are aware.
