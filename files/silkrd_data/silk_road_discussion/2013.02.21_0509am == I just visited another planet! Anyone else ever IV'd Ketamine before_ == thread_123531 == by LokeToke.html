				Ok I truly just had the most amazing experience of my life. I recently got some good Ketamine off of sr and decided I didn&#039;t feel like fucking my nose up today so thought I&#039;d do something different and try IV&#039;ing some, not IM&#039;ing, actually mainline IV&#039;d it. I went with 0.2g (200mg). Now I decided I&#039;d make a nice trip out of it so I already had my headphones on and right after pushing the plunger I hit play on my iPhone to play David Bowie that song Countdown Major Tom one then I fell back laying on my bed. All I have to say is oh my god. I visited another world. It brought me places I never knew existed. Listening to music on headphones after IV&#039;ing 0.2g (200mg) of Ketamine might truly be the best trip experience ever. It actually scared me at first because I didn&#039;t even know I was human if that makes sense. It was unreal. Definitely going to have todo this more often, maybe once or twice a week.<br /><br />Anyone else ever IV&#039;d Ketamine before? How was your experience?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />-LokeToke

				Always preferred IM.<br /><br />The one time I tried IV I was unconscious before I could even get the needle out of my arm...<br /><br />(Interesting addendum to that story, apparently when someone finds you catatonic with a needle in your arm they assume the worst... Luckily I came to before the hospital, etc. YMMV.)

				If you enjoyed the &quot;out of body experience&quot;, &quot;not being human&quot; and &quot;visiting another planet&quot; then i have to recommend DMT! It will blow your mind.

				Can someone describe exactly what a K-hole is supposed to feel like? I&#039;ve had some crazy ketamine experiences but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve ever actually holed. People make it seem like you are completely incapacitated, which never happened to me, it just becomes very hard and uncomfortable to move. I&#039;ve never had any of these out of body experiences either, it usually feels more like that scene from Trainspotting where he sinks into the rug if that makes sense.

Mostly because I&#039;ve done shrooms a few times and get way to paranoid and feel like my luck I&#039;ll have a paranoid trip on research type chemicals or LSD or something like that. The reason I am starting to love Ketamine is because it doesn&#039;t last like hours. Within 30 minutes your completely fine.<br /><br />Also the reason this is my new favorite thing is because I realized with straight main line IV&#039;ing it you can buy just like 1 gram and for each trip you can have a nice trip with only 0.1g (100mg) since its IV&#039;d, so you get like 10 really great trips out of 1 gram.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />-LokeToke

I&#039;m currently on daily methadone and have been for 4-5 years for opiate addiction/withdrawal. I currently still use opiates maybe once or twice a month and have been able to stay with only using opiates once or twice a month for over a year now so I don&#039;t have a problem with limiting myself as I just look forward to using. From going from 10-15 times a day shooting opiates to 1 or 2 times a month was a huge jump at first but now I don&#039;t have a problem doing it. I am going todo the same thing with K, use it maybe once or twice a month.<br /><br />Also the reason I am really going to limit it to that is because I just watched a episode of that National Geographic show called &quot;Drugs Inc&quot; and this episode was on Ketamine. They had all of these chronic Ketamine addicts on there and it turns out Ketamine in large doses, 1 gram a day or more, is actually toxic to the bladder and bladder lining. Over 40% of Ketamine addicts who use 1 gram or more everyday will develop serious bladder disease. The people had to get there bladder removed after it eats the lining of the bladder &amp; urinary tract causing you to pee blood and extremely painful. Some are in renal failure and needing a kidney transplant from complications originating from when they remove your bladder.<br /><br />Good episode to watch for any Ketamine users. Good thing that&#039;s only for chronic Ketamine users who use 1 gram or more every day. You can download the episode on common torrent websites.<br /><br />-LokeToke
