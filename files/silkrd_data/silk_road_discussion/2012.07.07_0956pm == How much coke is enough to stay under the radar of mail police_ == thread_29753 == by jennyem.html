				Just a question as I&#039;m a newbie user of SR:&nbsp; How do I make sure to buy enough without buying too much and sending a red flag to police or feds or whoever?&nbsp; Is there a certain amount of Bitcoins to spend on SR or &quot;things&quot; to order from sellers, that will still keep me off the radar without getting in any trouble?&nbsp; I am in the UK and mainly buy domestic.&nbsp; I am sure that helps?&nbsp; And what about other EU purchases etc?&nbsp; Any knowledgable info on this subject would help.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t want to get myself into something I can&#039;t get out of.&nbsp; thanks!

				Thanks both for the feedback.&nbsp; I want to make sure to have a good experience using SR and do things the right way.&nbsp; @Shannon: very true, thanks for the insight... I guess I am just new and nervous about it all!&nbsp; &nbsp;@TallTemptress: I must say, you just sounded a bit like Yoda.. but thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

				Hahaha!!&nbsp; Yes that is true! :)&nbsp; I really appreciate your feedback and insight.&nbsp; I want to become SR savvy and gain a good rep as a buyer... I think I just am nervous about the whole thing.&nbsp; It&#039;s silly because there is prob more danger in buying things on the street, but it is hard to wrap my head around this thing.&nbsp; I guess I will start very small and see what happens!&nbsp; Thanks again for your response.&nbsp; I like the SR family!&nbsp; I want in! :)

				yeah as Shannon said unfortunately there is no real &quot;safe&quot; amount, my main tip is never order more than you can afford to not pick up if something seems fishy. <br /><br />

				At least check up on on your local drug laws and the quantities that will result in a possession offense vs trafficable offense so you know what to expect worst-case-scenario.<br />

				I think below 5 grams may be ok, but if they catch you importing coke in the mail they will try to put you in jail for drug importation anyway. In Canada coke is a schedule 1 drug and can put you in jail for 7 years less a day.. and importing drug itself is another crime but i don&#039;t know the sentence for this.

				Yikes!&nbsp; 7 years!?&nbsp; I am in London and mostly trying to stay within the UK order/delivery zone.. But blow is the one thing that is not easy to find in London so I thought I&#039;d try giving the mail order thing a shot.&nbsp; I ordered 1 1/2 g so fingers crossed! (Fingers crossed that it comes and fingers crossed it doesn&#039;t get intercepted!)

				In USA you can do 5 years of jail just for weed possession, here this is not criminal (unless you have 1 kilo)

				Oh yeah i remember my first order, but must vendors here take big precautions with their packages and in the unlikely event that your order is caught by the customs for 1 1/2 gram i think they will just confiscate it .. They are looking for more big orders than that (like 1/2 kilo) and they have not the money to investigate all 1 gram order ...

I was afraid to order from the Netherlands before but i have ordered some E pills from Chemical Brothers and i have to say he use the best package i have seen so far!
