				Raw milk is practically illegal in America. There are dairy raids with guns drawn just like there are drug raids. Fucking insanity! I hate the draconian laws that grow worse every year. Some states allow you to drink your own and others have banned it completely. I think if it got enough attention raw milk would sell well here. I don&#039;t know how much it would cost to ship frozen raw milk. Probably a lot less in plastic. I love raw goat milk. It has many health benefits, but sometimes it is hard to find. What I&#039;d really like is some camel milk! It probably sounds bonkers to somebody who never had the thought, but you should research it. It&#039;s medicine. Delicious medicine.

				Every day I feel more and more that our society is rotting to hell - particularly in Merica. It&#039;s just getting to the point of disgusting how Wall Street and other selfish assholes can get away with raping anything they want; yet people like Aaron Swartz has to kill himself because he fought against the entertainment industry (anti SOPA/PIPA).<br /><br />It&#039;s really sickening to see how corrupt and perverse our society is,,. Merica in particular. I&#039;m thinking that all these inane reality tv shows, pop musicians like Beyonce, and the transition to &quot;entertainment news&quot; from &quot;informative/journalistic news&quot; are conditioning a generation of people to let society think for them, instead of doing it themselves. It&#039;s a viscious cycle and it tires me out how ignorant people are.

Totally not needed for locally sourced dairy products consumed reasonably fast though or we would have never made it to the 1800&#039;s when we started doing it here. The point really is that why the hell does my government need to shut down a farm that offers fresh milk when it is AS SAFE or SAFER than imported pasteurized stuff. The same holds true for just trying to buy a fucking chicken or a pig. You are not allowed to control your food. It must be processed with equipment you don&#039;t have and can&#039;t get. If you happen to live on a farm you might get away with this crime but if you sell your neighbor a skinned chicken or a quart of milk you&#039;re doing hard time.

				Pasteurized milk kills the health benefits of milk to a large extent and is not the governments role to decide for me what I put inside my body. Sacrifice freedom for security and you will lose both. Is your responsibility too to check milk before consuming it.

				this seems an incredibly weird desire. at least it&#039;s come from the right animal. there&#039;s people in the world right now who have no idea if their &quot;beef&quot; wasn&#039;t in fact a horse. just get a cow and milk it if you&#039;re that fussy about what&#039;s going on with your milk. pretty sure you have to ship fresh milk refrigerated and liquids aren&#039;t stealthy. buy a farm then you can have goats and camels and milk them at your convenience. i assume.<br />if you want to change a law so farmers can sell it then start a pressure group, write to your local political representatives, do some campaigning.. you&#039;ll probably find it hard to get many people that enthusiastic about milk though. if you don&#039;t look like a pedo maybe parents of young kids have the most interest in milk quality as a demographic. and vegan hipster types they&#039;ll get behind all sorts of shit.<br />but i&#039;ll say it once again, weird.

				&quot;Cuz the heart that betrays itself willingly is like a nation that trades freedom for stability&quot;<br />&quot;Regular&quot; milk here in America is poison and a lot of people that are into drugs, especially hallucinogenics, are actually pretty health oriented.

				We have farmers markets here too where you can buy milk and other crops from local farms.<br /><br />I have never heard of a milk raid before. <br /><br />Food safety here has gotten pretty bad since they deregulated the industry and made it dam near impossible to sue companies that allow contaminated food into the market. Not too long ago there was a huge problem with baby formula. <br /><br />I know there is some weird regulation about cleaning up spilled milk at dairy farms that is bizarro. But, If you want to drink unpasturized milk I doubt anyone would stop you. Just can&#039;t sell it to the public as unpasturized milk can go from healthy to poisonous very quickly. Some people would sell toxic milk without a care in the world.

				There are plenty of like minds on the road i see, it has attracted enlightened spirits.&nbsp; I would buy to offer my support...&nbsp; at least once.&nbsp; I recognize the benefits of raw unpasteurized milk from organic cows.&nbsp; &nbsp;IMO milk is for youngins not adults, thus i doubt i would personally invest many orders into raw milk.&nbsp; The milk bought at grocery stores should be dumped down the drain.&nbsp; Shipping raw milk will pose a problem, shipping it safely could be expensive, and hard to stealth. Seeing a product like that on the road, can open new and interesting doors.&nbsp; <br /><br />who&#039;s going to bring us the THC infused raw millk? yum..&nbsp; &nbsp;

Milk needs to be pasteurized in order to kill bacteria (the deadly kind). There is no significant difference in the nutritional value of raw and pasteurized milk, so why would you go for the one which makes you sick?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you read on some website that pasteurization replaces all the nutrients with &#039;toxins&#039; and that we&#039;re basically drinking cold semen when we buy milk from the store.... but not everything you read on the Internet is necessarily true, you know?

There are also several risks involved. I would never drink raw milk from a source I didn&#039;t know personally. The conditions that the cows are raised in can effect the final product drastically. Milk sold on SR could come from cows raised in conditions that could make it the most dangerous product sold here. If you are interested in raw milk, write your state legislature and encourage them to allow farm sales, but I would not want them to allow wide sales at grocery stores due to the risks to the public of not understanding the difference. Undoubtedly some parents would give raw milk to their young children and cause some serious illness because it was on the shelf at the store they felt it was safe. If you are looking for raw milk, check here: <br /><br />http://www.realmilk.com/real-milk-finder/<br /><br />Additionally, some farms are allowed to sell raw milk for &quot;pet food&quot; I am sure most people here are comfortable with that the same they have been comfortable with &quot;plant food&quot;.<br />I urge you to pay attention to the farm you use to buy your &quot;pet food&quot; and make sure you like the farm conditions and the farmer running the operation.<br />I enjoy raw milk myself, and encourage anyone who loves food to find a good source for the stuff and give it a try. Also, the only way you will get to taste&nbsp; brie or mozzarella the way it was intended is to make it yourself with fresh raw milk!
