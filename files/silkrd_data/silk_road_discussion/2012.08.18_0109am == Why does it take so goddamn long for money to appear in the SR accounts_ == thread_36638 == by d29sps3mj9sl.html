				I didn&#039;t time it, but it seemed to take in excess of 16 hours both times.&nbsp; Well the disruption in my plans cost me more than a day anyway.&nbsp; Why is it so goddamn slow?&nbsp; The bitcoin network does not take nearly that long to confirm payments to 6 confirmations.

				I&#039;ve funded via wallets and via btc software from a liberte image before. Whenever I use btc software it shows up in the SR account around 5 to 10 minutes after the 6th confirmation is in.<br /><br />Confirmations are passed around whenever a block is created, so the options are a) your wallet provider is slow or b) no blocks have been created for ages (unlikely but possible). I don&#039;t think it&#039;s on SR&#039;s side.

				The Bitcoin P2P network can slow down considerably if one of the larger mining pools goes down.&nbsp; This happened to me while I was transferring coins last year.&nbsp; I expected it to be completed in 1-2 hours, and it took 5 (I never had any bad luck worse than that--16 hours really blows).<br /><br />DeepBit is (I think) currently the largest processor on the BTC network.&nbsp; In order for a transaction into a SR account to be completed, 6 or more hosts need to &quot;solve&quot; the block containing the transaction, by performing work to solve a difficult mathematical problem.&nbsp; Each unit of work is called a hash, and each block takes a large number of hashes in order to be solved.&nbsp; Once a block is solved, 50 or 25 BTC are awarded to the wallet that is linked to the miner.&nbsp; A single user could try to solve blocks this way, but it would take a long time (each blocks problem is different, and the time it would take to solve is random).&nbsp; <br /><br />So pooled mining was devised.&nbsp; This is when the work to solve a block is distributed across many users.&nbsp; Each user gets a piece of the problem, solves it, and returns the solution to the mining host.&nbsp; When that block is solved, the BTC award is distributed proportionally to all the users who contributed to the solution, based on how much work they performed for that block.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mining introduces BTC into the economy, and helps it move BTC between addresses.&nbsp; But if a large pool experiences downtime, then the rate at which the blocks are solved goes down.&nbsp; This is what happened to me last year, but I can&#039;t say thats what happened for your two long transactions...you should have better luck in the future...
