				First it was the thread on the NSA illegal spying program, which I know must have been deleted by a mod because the OP reposted it and then it was deleted again. Then it was the thread on how to anonymize and encrypt telephone calls. Now it is the thread on Tor versus the NSA. None of these threads have been controversial at all, and no explanation has been given as to why they were mysteriously deleted. Are we not supposed to talk about the capabilities of the NSA? Are we not supposed to talk about how to secure telecommunications? I would like to know the general reasoning why these threads are being deleted, because I am sick of investing time in writing posts only to see them vanish without any explanation.

				I suppose that they could be being moved to sub forums that I don&#039;t have access to, but it seems that they are being deleted as my post history doesn&#039;t show that I have posted in any of them. I did make a reply to the original NSA thread that ended up being moved to off topic and not deleted, but the OP reposted the thread and PMed me that it was deleted again. The other threads are either being moved into a sub forum I don&#039;t have access to or they are being deleted or dropped from the database somehow. I was a bit surprised honestly, considering there was absolutely nothing controversial in any of the threads, and I have never seen threads deleted here before, but over the past couple of days there have been at least four that vanished. Two people have talked with me in PM about it and they also have the impression that the threads have been deleted. At first I figured it might be the OP deleting the thread, but I was informed that OP can only lock the thread, and in either case one of the OP&#039;s took the initiative to inform me that he did not delete it and asked me if I knew why it had been deleted.

				The thread I posted was definitely deleted &quot;5 facts about the NSA surveillance&quot; , which is fine, I understand the rationale.However,the police state for which America is turning into needs to be spoken about.If this isn&#039;t the place for discussion, that is out of my control; I am merely a guest traveler. I just want like minded individuals to be cognizant of the trajectory of the United States.

				I agree, if the administration prefers we do not talk about the NSA here I don&#039;t mind, I just want to know if that is official so I can avoid spending more time posting in&nbsp; threads that are destined to be deleted. I would also humbly suggest that maybe a sticky or something be made on the topic, so people know about it, rather than keep finding their posts and threads deleted and left wondering why. I suppose it does seem like the common theme in the deleted threads so far is the NSA, although in the case of the anonymized telephone thread the NSA was not mentioned in particular.

				If they are actually being deleted, then imho there is probably a good reason for it. I don&#039;t think we should view it as censorship per se if it is happening, but since this information is accessible by anyone, maybe some of it should be kept at least a little bit under wraps?

				This happens more than people notice, or check up on, I think. <br /><br />I watch the forums relatively closely.&nbsp; Anything since early this year (1-2/2013) that has had anything remotely...direct? (Not sure the word here) gets removed pretty quickly.&nbsp; This includes specific busts, certain encryption info, recently the NSA stuff, etc.&nbsp; Also, just about none of it has anything against forum rules, or identifies anyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m not exactly a tinfoil hat person, but through various posts on here, other forums, and even reddit, one can start getting the feeling that something else is going on behind the scenes.&nbsp;

				I follow the forums pretty closely as well, and until about a week ago I hadn&#039;t really seen anything get deleted other than spam, a very few controversial threads, and threads that should obviously have been deleted. However, over the past week or so, it seems like the threads I have been posting in are getting deleted within a few hours to a day tops. The only common theme I have noticed is that they all have had to do with the NSA, other than the one on phone encryption and anonymity, which only had to do with the NSA in an abstract and never explicitly mentioned way. Given that the recently deleted posts were not spam, that they were not at all controversial, and that they actually had some good info and debate going on in them, I don&#039;t see that they should have obviously been deleted, and it just leaves me hoping for clarification of the matter. I had a few dozen fairly large posts in all of the threads combined, and if I know that there is some &#039;flag&#039; that is getting these threads deleted, I will stop putting the effort forth to post in them. For now I can only speculate that they were deleted accidentally, perhaps by a mod trying to move them, or dropped by a software bug, or perhaps were deleted because they related to the NSA for some reason?

Any action that any member takes on the site causes their &#039;Last Active&#039; time to update. As the administrator&#039;s and moderator&#039;s &#039;Last Active&#039; time didn&#039;t update during or after the time period that the thread was delete, it means that no other administrator or moderator deleted the thread. Your argument is unsound and invalid. Just saying.<br /><br />I partially agree with the second part of your statement. Whilst approaching anything and everything with the mind of a conspiracy theorist is perhaps a tad over the top, &quot;trusting those in authority too much&quot; is certainly something I would encourage people not to get lackadaisical about. It is completely right for a community to question those in authority if / when they see something that they perceive to be wrong, and is in fact something I believe very strongly in doing. Government oppression is allowed to occur because people do not ask enough questions nor adequately demand answers from their governments.<br /><br />That being said, I formed a hypothesis on what happened based on the facts available to me and asked others to test that hypothesis for the reasons outlined in a previous post in this thread. That hypothesis being independently verified - along with the timestamps that were available - produced proof that no administrator nor moderator deleted any threads. Do you really think that we have that kind of oppressive censor-centric view here?!<br />The missing threads were deleted by their OPs. There is thankfully nothing more to it than that.<br /><br />Libertas

				Because DPR is the new Obama.

				That seems to be the logical explanation - but I just don&#039;t post that much in other people&#039;s threads, and certainly not 20 posts in one thread. So it would have required a whole number of threads where I made a couple of posts to all be deleted in the same week. Possible of course, but seems somewhat low probability....

				kmf and I discussed this issue privately before he created this thread. We noticed it because we both posted in several of the deleted threads. Neither of us has posted in this thread in several pages, so it seems we&#039;re both over it. I&#039;m definitely over it. I haven&#039;t seen any more threads disappear, so the issue is resolved as far as I&#039;m concerned. There&#039;s no reason to keep conspiracy theories alive here.<br />

				Hey Libertas,<br /><br />I&#039;ve just now noticed that my Newbie sub-forum thread is not there anymore. It used to be at http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108363.0 and was called &quot;BlueGiraffe GHB Everything Thread&quot;. <br /><br />I&#039;ve looked for it via the link and via the search function (multiple times) and it has definitely been deleted - I get this message: &quot;An Error Has Occurred! The topic or board you are looking for appears to be either missing or off limits to you.&quot;. <br /><br />This then explains why my post count dropped by 20 posts since last week (and that sounds about right for the number of posts I probably made on this thread). And I most certainly did not delete my own thread.<br /><br />So here is a very clear and direct example. Perhaps the previous issues were explained and resolved, but this one has not been. Please could you address as a matter of urgency.<br /><br />BG

No joke. Said karma is coming your way... said he had my name and address. Ten minutes later three cops, three different patrol cars, came to my door about a &quot;domestic dispute with sounds of guns fired.&quot; I had a pinch hitter, that I stupidly left in plain site, out and luckily they didn&#039;t arrest me. So far, this has been an awful awful day because frankly DOD won. I didn&#039;t try and sway him out of &quot;3.5 grams of MDMA to settle it&quot; I don&#039;t even know what 3.5 G of MDMA breaks down to ya know... I know what an 8th of pot is but for something like that????? and I&#039;m just not that type of guy... anyway... he won the debate. He kept PMing me threatening me about removing the thread...cops came to my door, I was nearly arrested, I removed the thread. I am no longer going to use the road. I am done with this otherwise amazing community because of one person. Be careful. <br /><br />Honestly looking out,<br />-Jasper<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Wow! <br /><br />DoD is InfiniteSucksaDickSource&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ding ding ding.
