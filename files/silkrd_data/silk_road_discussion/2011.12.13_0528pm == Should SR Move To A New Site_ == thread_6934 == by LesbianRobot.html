				Hello everyone...So I was goggling Silk Road and reading all of these shitty ass articles that have been written about SR. While reading all of these blogs and articles about how terrible SR is, the devil&#039;s playground, junkies, drug peddling thieves, junkies, and crimimals etc...etc...etc...blah, blah, fucking blah. So with all of the hype, media, bad press, negative feedback, federal eyeballs, moral scrutiny, and just all in all unwanted attention surrounding our special, and loving community....I was just thinking to myself, &quot;Would it be a good idea if we went into hiding? Change the server to a new location, get a new url, and just flat out attempt to erase ourselves from the mainstream. In doing something to this affect, would it be possible to evade the unwanted attention and the all seeing eye of the government?&quot;.<br /><br />So I propose these questions in front of everyone in our awesome community. We are pioneers yes, but the rest of the world is not ready for us, they are scared of the SR community, they fear us, their morals and laws prevent us from spreading the good things that we have to offer the entire planet.<br /><br />So what do you guys and gals think? Should we petition and band together and try to get SR to partially obscure us from those who wish to hinder our actions...help us hide away from the all seeing eye of the feds and law...please SR, make Silk Road a bit more hidden so we no longer feel the need to hide (that was a metaphor lol) and one day we will emerge from hiding when things are better for the types of people we are...<br />Before this thread gets overtaken with opinions I just want to leave you with a quick poetic phrase that is a bit anti-gov and somewhat relative to this topic. It is also somewhat directed towards the Gov/Fed powers at be, it is a bit rebellious and may spark feelings of anarchy lol<br /><br />Entitled&nbsp; ------&gt; &quot;Who needs words when you have sticks and stones?!?!&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I am a winner...god damn your righteous hand, you conservative and moral sinner. Our freedom grows slimmer and dimmer, fuck your hypocrisy, you idiosyncratic censors. They must have thought we were asleep, while our will only grew hotter. We are more than just mere sheep, being lead head first to a massive slaughter. We were all born to lose, but today the battlefield is ours to choose. We comrades love our community, our family and friends, and our anarchist unity. When we finally emerge...from the darkness and decay...justified generations will decide... finally, finally, it is judgement fucking day. We&#039;ll put them on trial...and they may finally pay...for this jury of junkies....we will have the final say. Finally, finally, we&#039;ll be the ones...we took back our streets...and we never had to use guns...&quot;<br />~L

				SR just barely changed the URL...Also, its an onion site, (I dont know if this actually&nbsp; happens) but I bet server type stuff is done in the clouds. i dont know how onion works, but where would they go. if they went to a traditonal .com or .org you have to register your location and its very easy to find that out even if you give false info.<br /><br />SR knows what they are doing. we need to do our part, by comunicating via pgp,etc. to keep safe. but&nbsp; I believe Sr is doing all they can and safe as possible..

If someone legit is looking for this place and they&#039;re ballsy enough/smart enough to figure out the system then they deserve to be able to use it. The very existence of SR shows that it&#039;s clear what the people want. It&#039;s just a matter of closing down certain three letter agencies and better educating the (American) public about the true nature of mood altering substances.<br /><br />Any service like SR would eventually receive media attention anyway. The beauty of SR already having that attention is that if worse comes to worse and something awful happens, there will be copycats and even more copycats. Moneys makes the world go round.

				No disrespect, but this is a terrible idea for a number of reasons, which I will list.<br /><br />1) Changing the address or otherwise trying to get away from the media interest in SR would be utterly ineffective. LE will have the new address, or an invite,&nbsp; or whatever system you could implement without basically shutting down the site, within a day of any change at the very most. The way this site must work, if it is to work at all (and so far it has), is for LE and everyone else to know about it, but have no way of stopping it. I suggest you read up on the Tor hidden service protocol. There isn&#039;t a whole lot LE can do to compromise the site directly, especially if everything is properly configured. The biggest risk is compromise by social engineering, and that risk would be made greater by what you propose. See the next point.<br /><br />2) Changing the address or anything else would create an opportunity for LE to hijack the site. They have done it before with carder forums. We have a nice address now, and after a scary several hours the community was able to regain confidence that the site had not been compromised, but those hours were scary for a reason, and going through that sort of thing again or worse would be a serious mistake, especially with so little to be gained.<br /><br />3) Less overt boards have existed before. What makes SR different is the novel synthesis of technologies that allow it to operate in the open without being easily shut down. To make the site less open would be to give up what makes the site so great. SR is, among other things, a form of civil disobedience against a set of unjust laws, and civil disobedience must be public to be effective.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong. We must all be vigilant and guard our anonymity carefully. If set up improperly, the site could be exposed. I am nearly always one of the first to point out potential security vulnerabilities in any new feature proposal. Sometimes the desire to do something about security is the enemy of real security, and I believe this is one of those times.

				i think its more a question of where SR is going :<br /><br />1. go further underground<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - how will new buyers &amp; sellers -join, or find the service themselves (?!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - SR will still attract attention to be closed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - require more money spent, more security...<br /><br />2. grow a lot bigger<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - requires more money, hardware, more bandwidth, more people to contribute.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - possibly form some sort of ISP (?!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - still attracts LE / government attention, unless<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - hybrid hidden Tor service from point 1 plus expansion.<br /><br />3. grow exponentially<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - requires added expense from point 2.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - would require complex networking of people to maintain.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - SR will still attract attention most likely resulting in joint LE / ISP / new laws to close it down, OR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the head-to-head confrontation results in it being allowed to operate in a &quot;controlled&quot; market, ie its<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; partly condoned and taxed like Holland {could go either way}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - define code of conduct, aims or goals -w/o this its likely to implode as its highjacked by criminals<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - has potential to literally change the world.<br /><br /><br />neither 1 NOR 2 deal with existing spies / troublemakers / undesireables / LE amongst us, requires thought / addressing seperately.<br />

				Hey guys, everyone has made a really good point. I have taken nothing offensively and any harsh or rude text is fine. This is the reason I posted this question, to stir a bit and see where people stand on this subject. Obviously I wasn&#039;t precise with some of the comments I had originally made but each of your detailed descriptions of why you may or may not agree is great. Thanks for feedback and I hope to hear from a lot of different opinions. Thanks guys!<br /><br />~L

Having said that I put off joining SR for years due to all the &quot;media attention&quot; it got&nbsp; I just couldn&#039;t believe that business is STILL done on here and hasn&#039;t been subject to some sort of &quot;takedown&quot; despite all the press...
