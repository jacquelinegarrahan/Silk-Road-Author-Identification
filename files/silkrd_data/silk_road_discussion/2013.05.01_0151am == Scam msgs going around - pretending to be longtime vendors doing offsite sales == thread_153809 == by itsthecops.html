				I got two scam emails from so called long time vendors with fake URLS to silk road that doesn&#039;t work, so you can&#039;t verify it.<br />They are vendor names I&#039;ve never of before and their posts count is like 55.<br /><br />They make it sound like they have been around a long time and this is routine for them.<br />They offer great deals and email link to a tormail address to continue the sale out of escrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its hard to verify who is really a vendor and who isn&#039;t at this point.&nbsp; Also, if its against the rules or not.&nbsp; Usually, you would get banned for doing this.&nbsp; <br />So, is ok or what? <br /><br />Its a scammers paradise out here.&nbsp; Anything goes?

				Well, I thought it was against the rules to advertise your sales at other markets or to invite buyers to place orders via email / PM as well, but I double checked with DPR today and he instructed us not to do anything about it.&nbsp; I was confused trying to validate who was actually a vendor and who was not, which is why I asked DPR for clarification.

				Post count is a good indication that it&#039;s a scam. You can also look for legitimate feedback threads and/or forum vendor status. <br /><br />Personally, I would only trust the vendors that have proven themselves to me in the past though even that is a gamble.

				There will be no escrow protection. A lot of these vendors now advertising on the forum would be hurting because their funds are locked in their SR accounts. Even a legitimate vendor might feel tempted to scam someone on the forum because there would be no proof a transaction ever took place.

				Yes, Post count is helpful.<br />Previous contact is good.&nbsp; <br /><br />I notice the PGP keys of vendors have their email in it, you could use that as verification. (assuming you already have the key.)&nbsp; Also, they should be able to use PGP in any email message and be familiar with it.<br /><br />I worry for people who may be &#039;desperate&#039; so to speak and fall to temptation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most are experienced and know the routine.<br />

				I guess doing it in the open forum is better. There will be record of it there forever, unless the OP deletes it.&nbsp; Then square up later when the site up.
