				nope. make sure your clock is set right and try hitting new identity in the Videlia control panel. sometimes needs 1 or 2 identity refreshes. give it 15-30- seconds after each refresh to full reestablish with new identity and then reload the page. the clock was key for alot of ppl.

				Well, i&#039;ve had that issue before, but i&#039;m having the same problem now and I&#039;m relatively certain that isn&#039;t the reason for my problem this time.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check again and report back if it fixes the issue.

				the tips i suggested are very true in almost all cases but i just noticed i am no longer able to connect and given all the ppl saying at once i would think maybe SR is just down for maintenance or there is a glitch. either way im sure it will be back up shortly.<br />

				huh, well this is unfortunate timing for me. :(<br /><br />@snickerlover: It&#039;s honestly probably just gonna be offline for a few hours. this isn&#039;t the first time this kind of thing has happened.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually just associated with updates they&#039;re doing or working on the site in general.&nbsp; If there was something serious you&#039;d think the forums would go down as well.

				its definitely down. the reason is up in the air. <br /><br />recently it has been redirecting to a SR page during maintenance. kinda scary every time this happens.<br /><br />hopefully nothing serious, there are backup servers anyway. just been fortunate to have great accessibility recently so it is distressing not to be able to access<br /><br />if you were around before six months ago though, this was a common regularity. seemed like half the time you tired to get on the site was down. very frustrating&nbsp;

				ya the site has been rock past few months but definitely when i first started here back in nov2011 the site used to go down all the time or be inaccessible . DPR has definitely improved the stability. running a hidden service isnt the same as running a cleartext site so the &quot;down for maint&quot; pages arent always the easiest thing to implement.<br />

				I gotta say sometimes I wonder what the fuck is wrong with the administration on this site. The main site itself is solid but as far as treatment of the community it&#039;s very poorly ran. Why would they take down the site for updates and not tell anyone? I&#039;m sure they foresaw people freaking about the fact they just shut the site down. Why not at least report in? Little forum post from DPR or another admin or something notifying people?<br /><br />Because when shit like this happens we don&#039;t know WHAT the deal is. It could be the last time we ever see SR, we don&#039;t know. It&#039;s important to notify the community beforehand or at the very fucking least DURING updates/maintenance.
