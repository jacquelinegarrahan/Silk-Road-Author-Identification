				Did you ever see the TV Series &quot;Dollhouse?&quot; Well, there is a place called &quot;The Attic&quot; in this series, where if you fucked up that&#039;s where you are forever doomed to go..That&#039;s where SR would go if they ever found him lol, or worse. Guess it depends on the government that finds him..I honestly suspect that when the Road took off with real profits, he upgraded everything, and moved it somewhere super secret, and did all the super secret precautionary things he could do to hide his shit, and cover his ass if it ever was found.<br /><br />-NS

				I don&#039;t think there would be any precedent for anything like this, so really who knows. The only case I can think of that would have any similarities is the one against the guys that created the Pirate Bay. They were charged with accessory to crimes against copyright law, so I suppose he could get accessory to drug dealing charges and whatever sentence that could bring.

				Don&#039;t quote me on this, I am not a lawyer. But, as I understand it, the Silk Road qualifies as a Continuing Criminal Enterprise. The only thing worse than this is being an Al-Qaeda member being held in gitmo. The following applies for CCE&#039;s:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_Criminal_Enterprise</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute (commonly referred to as CCE Statute or The Kingpin Statute) is a United States federal law that targets large-scale drug traffickers who are responsible for long-term and elaborate drug conspiracies. Unlike the RICO Act, which covers a wide range of organized crime enterprises, the CCE statute covers only major narcotics organizations. CCE is codified as Chapter 13 of Title 21 of the United States Code, 21 U.S.C. ยง 848. The statute makes it a federal crime to commit or conspire to commit a continuing series of felony violations of the 1970 Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act when such acts are taken in concert with 5 or more other persons. For conviction under this statute, the offender must have been an organizer, manager, or supervisor of the continuing operation and have obtained substantial income or resources from the drug violations.[1]<br /><br />The sentence for a first CCE conviction is a mandatory minimum 20 years&#039; imprisonment (with a maximum of life imprisonment), a fine of not more than $2 million, and forfeiture of profits and any interest in the enterprise. Under the so-called &quot;super kingpin&quot; provision added as subsection (b) to the CCE statute in 1984, a person convicted of being a &quot;principal&quot; administrator, organizer, or leader of a criminal enterprise that either involves a large amount of narcotics (at least 300 times the quantity that would trigger a 5-year mandatory-minimum sentence for possession), or generates a large amount of money (at least $10 million in gross receipts during a single year), must serve a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole (sometimes referred to as a &quot;living death&quot; or &quot;pine box&quot; sentence, since the offender is strictly ineligible for release while alive). Anyone engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise who intentionally kills a person or causes an intentional killing may be sentenced to death. Probation, parole, and suspension of the sentence are prohibited.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In addition, they can seize all assets in anyway related to the enterprise.

				If DPR ever gets busted then it falls to the SR community, esp. the top sellers, to aid DPR somehow.<br />e.g. making certain his &#039;stay&#039; is more comfortable, supporting any dependents, legal appeal funding etc<br /><br />In general there ought to be a Insurance Fund for all seller participants in SR. If we don&#039;t take care of our own, then nobody will.<br />Something like a 1% tax to the Fund seems appropriate, and I think would be acceptable to 99% of the SR community.<br /><br />However, administrating the Fund... that could be a little tricky. Anyway, it&#039;s an idea.

				It would depend on which country nabbed him.&nbsp; I am hoping that SR is smart enough to either live in, or have moved to, a non-extradition country with more lax laws towards drugs.&nbsp; This way he might end up with a 5 year sentence.<br /><br />It&#039;s either that or set up shop on the moon, at this point.&nbsp; He could be the Newt Gingrich of the online drug world!

				I think SR is Dutch. <br />so none of the american terminology even applies.<br /><br /><br />his country is not&nbsp; a secret since he&#039;s been selling shrooms here himself before the thing got big.<br /><br />just for the record&nbsp; - i don&#039;t know anything for sure, and haven&#039;t ordered anything from SR himself, but I do remember<br />him selling them shrooms.

I was also thinking the same thing for SR, since he gets a cut from every sale technically each sale is a count. If I were SR or a top vendor I&#039;d have a cyanide vile round my neck. No way I&#039;m going away for 100&#039;s possibly 1000&#039;s of years.

Unlike the RICO Act, which covers a wide range of organized crime enterprises, the CCE statute covers only major narcotics organizations. CCE is codified as Chapter 13 of Title 21 of the United States Code, 21 U.S.C. ยง 848. The statute makes it a federal crime to commit or conspire to commit a continuing series of felony violations of the 1970 Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act when such acts are taken in concert with 5 or more other persons. For conviction under this statute, the offender must have been an organizer, manager, or supervisor of the continuing operation and have obtained substantial income or resources from the drug violations.[1]<br /><br />The sentence for a first CCE conviction is a mandatory minimum 20 years&#039; imprisonment (with a maximum of life imprisonment), a fine of not more than $2 million, and forfeiture of profits and any interest in the enterprise. Under the so-called &quot;super kingpin&quot; provision added as subsection (b) to the CCE statute in 1984, a person convicted of being a &quot;principal&quot; administrator, organizer, or leader of a criminal enterprise that either involves a large amount of narcotics (at least 300 times the quantity that would trigger a 5-year mandatory-minimum sentence for possession), or generates a large amount of money (at least $10 million in gross receipts during a single year), must serve a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole (sometimes referred to as a &quot;living death&quot; or &quot;pine box&quot; sentence, since the offender is strictly ineligible for release while alive). Anyone engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise who intentionally kills a person or causes an intentional killing may be sentenced to death. Probation, parole, and suspension of the sentence are prohibited.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In addition, they can seize all assets in anyway related to the enterprise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Silk Road admin would certainly be charged with running a continuing criminal enterprise if not RICO. He would most likely get a life sentence, or what amounts to one. Even if he is just charged for fairly large scale money laundering (which he is clearly guilty of running a mix for drug money) he would be facing twenty five years on that charge alone. <br /><br />Mods of this forum would also face similar sentences for being in authority positions. Although technically anyone who participates in illegal activity on this forum could be charged as a RICO participant, if you are charged under RICO you can get charged for the crimes of the enterprise rather than charged with your specific crimes. Participating on silk road or any other forum like this is not likely to get you a slap on the wrist, almost everyone who participates here in USA could face a life sentence if they wanted to give you one. Of course they will not give 150,000 people life sentences though. SR is kind of strange in that it is easily the largest (participant wise) named drug trafficking organization in the history of the world. Most DTO are considered large if they have a few thousand participants. The internet makes having over a hundred thousand participants operating under the same organization name much easier. The laws on the books certainly technically apply to SR participants, but the gov didn&#039;t have organizations like SR in mind when they made the laws (after all they probably don&#039;t want to give you a life sentence for ordering a gram of weed, even though by ordering a gram of weed here you are technically capable of being charged with RICO violations due to the structure of this organization). <br /><br />Under the Ryan Haight act it is actually illegal for American citizens to even have an account on this forum, since it is a website with the primary goal of trafficking in scheduled drugs.

				They would probably charge him with 80,000 counts of BEING A FUCKING BALLER.&nbsp; But on a more serious note, there is probably much less probability of SR being caught than Enelysion.&nbsp; Enelysion was doing something observable and messy.&nbsp; The government is much better at tracking down drug dealers than online hidden services, considering they haven&#039;t done the latter.&nbsp; If I were him, I would definitely take Enes advice of keeping a cyanide capsule around, unless of course he is in Russia or something like that.

Under the so-called &quot;super kingpin&quot; provision added as subsection (b) to the CCE statute in 1984, a person convicted of being a &quot;principal&quot; administrator, organizer, or leader of a criminal enterprise that either involves a large amount of narcotics (at least 300 times the quantity that would trigger a 5-year mandatory-minimum sentence for possession), or generates a large amount of money (at least $10 million in gross receipts during a single year), must serve a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole (sometimes referred to as a &quot;living death&quot; or &quot;pine box&quot; sentence, since the offender is strictly ineligible for release while alive). Anyone engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise who intentionally kills a person or causes an intentional killing may be sentenced to death.

However since a lot of packages are sent to the USA, the Feds will push for extradition. That&#039;s the same thing that happened to Marc Emery. He was selling weed seeds via mail order from Canada (selling seeds is not illegal there) and some orders went to the USA. He is currently sitting is a US Federal Correctional Facility. The DEA pushed hard for his extradition and political strings were pulled. They had to get him. It was a political thing. He&#039;s a political prisoner. He&#039;s kinda like the Canadian Silk Road except he wasn&#039;t anonymous.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Emery
