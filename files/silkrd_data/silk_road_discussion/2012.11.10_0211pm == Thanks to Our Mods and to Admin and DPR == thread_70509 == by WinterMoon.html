				Since I can&#039;t buy or even browse cannabis strains, this seems like a good time to send a shout out to the Mods, Admin, DPR and everyone else who works so tirelessly on the SR (look at all the spam Guru has to clean up today!) <br /><br />Thank you!&nbsp; <br />Merci!&nbsp; <br />Danke!&nbsp; <br />Gracias!&nbsp; <br /><br />Obviously we can&#039;t do this now but I nicked this from a squidShepherd sticky: <br />APPRECIATE OUR MODS?

				I want to agree with the OP. Thank you for all you do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been here long enough to know this is not a scam, and realize you are understaffed for such a task.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like you can put an ad in the paper looking for help, or hire some consulting firm without becoming a beacon for LEO.&nbsp; So even though there are many that accusing scam please do not pay attention to those comments. They are just newbies that don&#039;t know better.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Thank you for all of that you do.

				I&#039;d like to give a shout out to all our vendors as well, the products on this site are among the very best available.&nbsp; Healthy competition has kept prices reasonable and quality top-notch.&nbsp; Silk Road is one of the best things that ever happened to me.

Be careful what you install, especially when you&#039;re trying to stay anonymous...

				I just wanted to echo the sentiments - kudos to DPR &amp; Co., obviously most of us here dabble in a little this a little that, and from some of the posts I&#039;ve read (&quot;OMFG DPR could be half-way to Honolulu!?!&quot;) - and I can sympathise I&#039;ve a decent-sized order in limbo - some of us might be letting the dwindling of our stashes impair our judgements. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t fucking Craigslist, occasionally shit&#039;s gonna go awry, but I for one, and I&#039;m sure most of us here, absolutely respect this place and the community and wouldn&#039;t want anything we did, or anyone else, to jeopardize it. <br />And I don&#039;t know a whole lot about the folks running it, but the impression I get is that they feel the same way. So I too will be spending the rest of the night elsewhere confident that come tomorrow, or maybe the next day, normal service will have resumed and all will again be right in the world. <br /><br />Peace out folks :D
