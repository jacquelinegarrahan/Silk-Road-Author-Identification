				Can you stop blasting the forums with this stupid shit? If you do then maybe someone like myself who has their shit together will help you out.<br />But what the community does not need is your multiple post in the same forum with the same topic that you lost 50k.<br /><br />And now you are looking for money so you can open accounts on new sites. If you realy want help then I will help you. But first you must show me you are serious and not some stupid kid. Because right now with your post.you come of as a stupid kid.and I do not help stupid kids.<br /><br />Just making this thread asking for coins is really lame.<br />You are a very smart guy so you should be able to se this yourself and edit the titles. then PM me for help.

We lost close to that stuck in escrow or in balance. We are not losing our heads over it, if you know anything about business, you will find it somewhere in the beginning of the pages, there&#039;s something called pilferage. Maybe this will make you feel a bit better about what&#039;s happened/happening. <br /><br /><br />Shit as much I as I try to convince myself otherwise...it&#039;s happening.<br /><br /><br />Meerkovo
