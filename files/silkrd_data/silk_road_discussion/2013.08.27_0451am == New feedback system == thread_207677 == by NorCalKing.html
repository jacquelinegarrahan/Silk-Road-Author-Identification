				I am not that big of a fan that each rating has it&#039;s on column thingy, it&#039;s too big and not too easy on the eyes if i was skimming comments on the item<br />it should be like the old one but with a little + icon to expand it if you really wanted to read more depth on the rating

				its OK for now and leading into a good direction. there is some things though;<br />a) the feedback-boxes are too big (space-wise). although thats only a cosmetic aspect, I think it makes it hard to read and get an overview. (MeowFlakes said that already). I would also propose to be able to change the order of appearance on the main page, not on a sub-settings-page.<br />b) the feedback you can access and view from the account section appears to be disconnected from the given feedback on the vendor page, I have lots of feedback but they are not visible for me from the account-feedback section. newest one there is &gt;one day old.<br />c) why did the feedback of the listings vanish?<br />d) one users changed his feedback score before the new system was set up. it is the old feedback score again and now he can not change it at all<br />e) how often is the average rating of a vendor updated ? I think that could be more often than once weekly.

				As far as the not being able to change feedback my only opinion of that is you should&nbsp; be able to change it once time and only up to 7 days after leaving it. <br /><br />But more importantly the reason I&#039;m writing here is to let DPR know I&#039;m not liking the fact that when I click on an item now there is no feedback on the bottom of the page for that specific item.

				One of the greatest things about SR used to be that you could click on a vendor&#039;s product page and see all of the feedback associated with that product. That ended with this update. All of that is gone now.<br /><br />There&#039;s no way to see all of the feedback for one product on one page. You have to manually go through all the general feedback and try to fish out the feedback on the product you&#039;re considering buying.<br /><br />TOTALLY NOT COOL.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Maybe it could be set up so that Feedback can be changed if both the Vendor and the Buyer agree to it.<br /><br />Like if the Buyer wants to change feedback, the system will alert the Vendor and the Vendor has to agree to it to allow it to be changed.<br /><br />Likewise, the Vendor can ask the Buyer to change feedback and the Buyer can either accept the change or stick with their current feedback.

				Hi again, just wanted to spam this thread with my updated suggestion: buyers should only be able to edit their one most recent feedback with a vendor, older feedback locked. This prevents buyers with multiple recent feedbacks using them to blackmail vendors.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If a buyer can blackmail a vendor with one feedback, they can do that anyway, by messaging the vendor and threatening to leave a 1/5. So locking feedback does not protect against that. If a single feedback can destroy a vendors rating then the rating system is broken.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As people have pointed out in this thread there are many reasons a buyer might want to alter feedback, not just blackmail.&nbsp; If you have a problem with a vendor that he later resolves for instance. Of course there will always be assholes; you can&#039;t protect against assholes completely

				Part of the problem here is that for ever buyers have felt that they were being forced to give a vendor a 5/5 or they might not be able to order from them again, or they would get put onto the blackballed list, &amp; that the system was flawed as a result.&nbsp; Which in part they are correct, but by attempting to implement such a big change by saying that doing a &quot;good job&quot; is rewarded by giving a 4/5, it is too radical of a score when vendors have been working hard to maintain as high of a rating as possible only to get knocked down 20% for doing nothing different!<br /><br />While I understand that DPR &amp; the buyers &amp; the vendors would like the numbers to make sense, this is why DPR took out the (100) out of the mix which would make it less apparent at first glance as to the vendor&#039;s numbers taking a dive.&nbsp; The problem is that by changing this as well as changing the way the listed feedback on the vendors page is done removes the ease of getting at just a quick glance the lay of the land at just how each vendor is doing.&nbsp; With the (100) % it will tell them exactly where they are in the scheme of things, &amp; by being able to see the last 10 (which should have been maybe 20 per page) they can see what people are saying with the most current feedback good or bat &amp; what the actual ratio of good to bad REALLY is.&nbsp; They can see in a split second if the vendor is currently busy or only has 4 feedbacks in the last month etc.&nbsp; there is a lot that can be gleaned in a very short time with only looking at those 2 sources.<br /><br />By not allowing any other choice but a 20% segment, it cannot give an accurate picture of the transaction.&nbsp; The choices need to allow for tenths to become a part of the metrix.&nbsp; Like if the order was sent out on time &amp; all went well, but the description didn&#039;t match the product but the buyer was overall happy they could put a 4.9/5 with a much better description of how the rating system should work.&nbsp; This is probably the closest direction that could make the system as accurate as possible, along with giving the (100) back with the vendor&#039;s name, &amp; giving realtime accurate feedbacks as soon as they come in.<br /><br />Also the feedback rating would be allowed to be changed by the buyer up to 2 months later, but they could only raise the 4.5/5 not lower it.<br /><br />NCK

				What was the flaw that was sought out to be fixed in the beginning? I can not think of a single problem that the new system has solved without creating an entirely new one problem in the process. Are we creating a new look/ feel to compete with the other blackmarket? If this is case, as suspect it is, that would be entirely the wrong reason for such an overhaul.

				Yes, but vendors have lost the &quot;view feedback&quot; link. You can use recent order link though to see ratings. And of course, you can figure out who left what even if they used an alias. <br /><br />Win some, lose some. But overall, definitely liveable.

				I still think my solution was better (only able to change most recent feedback with vendor) If you can only delete feedback it is not very informative to people reading it. Say you have a problem with a vendor which he resolved for you. All that will show in your feedback is a bad feedback which then disappears, rather than information on what happened and how it was fixed, Conversely, if you give a 5/5 on receipt of the drugs but after reflection realise they are not up to scratch all that will show in the feedback is a 5/5 that later disappears. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a particular problem with FE. Under the old system, you could see how many people were FEing and then watch their FEs turn to 5/5 as the packages arrived. This was a great way of checking out a vendor; if he is treating his FE customers well he is probably trustworthy. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lack of feedback is not informative. This is the main problem with the new system. People who are happy with transaction but didn&#039;t leave a review aren&#039;t informative to other customers. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not complaining about this just for the sake of it, on the whole I am happy with new system but I feel we have lost a lot of nuanced information with the ability to alter feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Making it possible to alter only your last feedback with a vendor&nbsp; prevents using multiple feedback to blackmail while keeping the ability to communicate an ongoing situation to other customers.
