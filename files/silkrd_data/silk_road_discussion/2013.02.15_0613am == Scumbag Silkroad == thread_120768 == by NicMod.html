				Of all the days for SR to go down....<br /><br />I bolted home after work, laptop out, logged/tried logging on to SR, and nearly cried when i saw it was down.<br /><br />I need to be logged on to see my deposit addy, so thought fuck it, throw those round ones into your other wallet, even though i hate it to bits and havent used it for my last 18 transactions...<br /><br />So threw them in there....basically there was a sale that ends at midnight tonight, so just hoping SR comes back sometime today.... ::)<br /><br />Wonder if we all lose any coins that we once had in there? :-X

				Have you tried wrapping your laptop in tin foil? it will guarantee you will not loose your coins&nbsp; :P<br /><br />As scout said calm the fuck down people, if you can&#039;t live for 24 hours without access to SR you need a real life reality check.<br /><br />When I saw the maintenance screen I just knew what would be waiting for me in the forums, the trolls would be out in force and low and behold there they were, all we need now is MtlJohn to make a reappearance and my day will be complete.<br /><br />And to anyone seriously disadvantaged by the down time I apologize, I&#039;m just being sarcastic to inject some humor into this situation.<br /><br />SR will be back up in no time.

				Maybe there should be a Matrix version of SR, too. in case SR ever goes down and the people wanting to use SR could do so in the emulated version. When SR is fixed, a message prompts the user that everything they have done from x time to y time has been reversed and the issue occurred and was fixed in the ignorance of the user. <br /><br />Is this a good idea or is it just me trolling in my own thoughts?<br /><br />Entity

				ofc SR is faster than ever, cause no one is connected to it at the moment..<br />and obviously the &quot;site under maintenance&quot; is posted by DEA !<br />seriously, what else would they do once they hit SR servers, if not do improve SR for us.<br /><br />i bet they would not take the site down, or hijack high rate seller accounts.<br />why would they? if they do people on SR could get caught and they will have to work! <br />instead of wanking behind a desk to porn while pretending to do surveillance SR.<br />(THAT IS RIGHT ! I AM TALKING ABOUT YOU LE&#039;s, SO PULL YOUR DICK BACK IN YOUR PANTS AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE !)

				Ever notice when there is an error with SR that involves the site loosing money or giving coins in error to members. - they shut the whole site down immediately. .. BUT when its the other way around. . its business as usual . . not to worry. . it must be this or that. .&nbsp; funny.
