				Was drug tested by psychemedics about 2 weeks ago, I used a small amount of MDMA 3 weeks prior to that. This was a hair follicle test which is incredibly accurate. Although I heard that they can only say you failed the test if a certain amount of the substance is found in your hair, so then they can crackdown more on abusers rather than one time users.<br /><br />Anyone know more about psychemedics or this test?

				This place looks pretty serious.&nbsp; No personal experience but their website and credentials look pretty impressive.<br /><br />3 weeks definitely is within range of detection for hair tests.&nbsp; I would say it&#039;s probably within the sweet spot.<br /><br />They claim up to three months.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t heard back in two weeks that is a bad sign IMO.&nbsp; It was for a job I assume?

				I miscalculated a bit, its actually been 3 weeks since the test. I&#039;m assuming that if I failed it they would have notified me by now?<br /><br />Yes, it was for a job. My only hope is that the level of MDMA found was not enough to trigger a positive result.

				Are you working at this job already or are you waiting to hear back about the drug test before you start employment?<br /><br />If you are working there then I would assume that you passed the test.<br /><br />If you are NOT working there but are waiting for someone to contact you back to tell you that you passed, that is NOT a good sign.&nbsp; Hair tests should not take this long.<br /><br />How much MDMA exactly was it that you took?

				Working at the job already. I also assume I passed the test, but its possible that the results aren&#039;t back yet or I haven&#039;t been notified yet that I failed(although I think if I failed they would tell me asap).<br /><br />It was quite a small amount, around ~30mg. I was not looking to roll, but simply for threshold effects that reduce anxiety and nervousness. I had to do something important and needed to take the edge off. Also I was under the impression that MDMA was not tested for in this specific test since I was told they don&#039;t test for ecstasy, turns out that their amphetamines test screens for MDMA too.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />also the mdma was listed at only 84% purity.

				84% purity is the highest theoretical purity for MDMA.<br /><br />Most of the stuff sold on the road marked as 84% is not actually 84%.&nbsp; It&#039;s just marketing.<br /><br />30mg is a very small dose.&nbsp; There is a chance it may not have been enough to detect as a positive in the test.<br /><br />If you are working there after three weeks It is highly unlikely that you failed.
