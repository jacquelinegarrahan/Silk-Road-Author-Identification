				I love the title of his post: &quot;Recent FUD about Atlantis on Silk Road&quot;<br /><br />http://atlmlxbk2mbupwgr.onion/index.php?topic=235.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=235.msg932#msg932">Quote from: Vladimir on April 29, 2013, 01:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi all,<br /><br />It has come to our attention that some users on Silk Road believe the following;<br /><br />1.&nbsp; That I am a scammer and was involved in a Ponzi scam on Silk Road.<br />2.&nbsp; The moderators at Atlantis market are deleting user comments.<br />3.&nbsp; Our forums term of use policy is aimed to arrest people and record information.<br />4.&nbsp; That we are DDoS&#039;ing Silk Road.<br />5.&nbsp; Our PGP system is crackable.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to take the time to address each point and if you have any questions, please don&#039;t hesitate to reply to this thread. The staff members at Atlantis and I are happy to address your questions.<br /><br />1) This belief has come into existence as &#039;Vladimir&#039; was a scammer on Silk Road and thus people thought I was the same person as him. Unfortunately without knowing Vladimir&#039;s past history, this is my name and the one I have chosen to use. Hypothetically if I was Vladimir, why would I use a scammers alias at a market place which deals directly with user funds? It wouldn&#039;t help build trust in our market place and doesn&#039;t make any sense at all. Its the equivalent of pirateat40 creating a new Bitcoin Savings and Trust scheme and asking people to re-invest in it. We&#039;re proud to say that in our 7 weeks of operation, we have suffered no down time, no users have lost funds and security concerns have been addressed promptly (like increasing PGP key support up to 16Kbits).<br /><br />2) We have deleted posts only related to spam, posts involving unfounded claims or accusations (FUD) and have deleted no posts in which people have given us criticism, bug reports or requests about improving security. You can check the relevant forum sections to find examples of this. We actively encourage this feedback as it helps us create a better market place. We are here to help users and are happy to reply to any security concerns or criticism you have. We have also created a sticky topic in the general forums for people to post whatever conspiracy theories they like. We will not be moderating this thread however the other forum rules still apply.<br /><br />3) We used the default term of service which comes with the forum software. You can find an exact replica when you download and install the SMF software. This has now been updated. <br /><br />4) We believe competition is healthy and believe that Dead Pirate Roberts is a great leader. We also need to shed the light that Silk Road has had technical issues in the past, even when we weren&#039;t around. Things like item listing image hijacking, denial of service attacks, site upgrades and switching hosting providers all caused down time. Although it would assist in us gaining more market share if our largest competitor is down, we have no desire to resort to dodgy tactics. We believe that what goes around comes around.<br /><br />5) The auto-encryption service only works IF the user or vendors uploads their PGP public key (we support key sizes of 1024 - 16384 bits). However, Atlantis also supports manual encryption outside of Atlantis in which users can use a PGP client to encrypt their message. Atlantis administrators and law enforcement could not decipher the encrypted message without the users private key. With all this said, the security comes down to the end user. If they don&#039;t trust the auto-encryption service, they can STILL manually encrypt the message outside of Atlantis and thus there is absolutely no risk of anyone being able to decipher the message. To this day, PGP with large key sizes (&gt;= 4096bits) is still uncrackable, you can find more information about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Security_quality. Noting: &#039;there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic or computational means.&#039;<br /><br />As stated earlier, if you have any concerns please don&#039;t hesitate to reply to this thread. Lastly, we&#039;d like to thank all the people who have put their trust in Atlantis and believe in where we are heading. The ride is only just starting and we&#039;re glad to have you as part of Atlantis :)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, what is the verdict?

				I&#039;m not sure. I have an account on their site and forums but have done nothing but logged in and perused the selection to get an overall feel for the place. It seems new and new things generally turn people who are highly suspicious off. We live in a world where we have to break the law to self medicate and so chose to do that, and I think Atlantis simply needs to stick around and prove itself. Time will tell.<br /><br />Also it&#039;s dRead Pirates Roberts. Not dead.

				Well, that&#039;s something nice to say about ASKY I guess.<br /><br />I think the whining about scammers is pretty funny though.&nbsp; The nature of any underground market online is that there WILL be scammers, both vendors and customers.<br /><br />There is no way to verify the identity of vendors, no way to verify a package actually contains what a vendor says it does, and no way to verify that the customer did or didn&#039;t actually receive anything.&nbsp; That&#039;s why scammers run rampant for a few weeks, it takes that long to verify if they are scamming, if the customer is scamming, or if it&#039;s BS.&nbsp; Mail isn&#039;t delivered instantly, and &quot;love letters&quot; are not sent out to every recipient of seized mail.<br /><br />SR does ban scammers when they become apparent, but they can&#039;t ban a scammer just because 5 people are saying they are a scammer, they could be puppet accounts of a competitor.&nbsp; So it takes time to properly sort it out, you have to wait until either enough people are crying scam or some of your &quot;trusted members&quot; are.&nbsp; ASKY will be no different, once scammers get to work there, the only thing they might do that SR won&#039;t is lock scam accounts early and wait until folks prove themselves as non-scammers(which is quite difficult).<br /><br />That is why you HAVE to do your research when buying, regardless of where you do it.

Take a look here -&quot;<br />...<br /><br />WOW Looks like they treat there forum users/customers like children, HA, you cant say this you cant do that or we will delete your posts or ban you instantly..... Pfft Good thing about sr forums you are not made to feel you need to &quot;refine&quot; what you say or have some power hungry children dictating what you can and cant do.<br /><br />It shows great integrity of DPR to leave every single post thats been made about &quot;ATLANTIS&quot; for all see on silkroad forums without feeling threatened by competition and feeling the need defend what he has created and not removing &quot;FUD&quot; As they call it over there at that prison where they got so many rules u might have watch where you step....<br /><br />Please leave the forums just as they are, with the trolls well maybe not the btc scammers but definitely leave all the &quot;FUD&quot; And all the &quot;GARBAGE&quot; that is accepted here because its fine the ways it is.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />My thoughts about Atlantis... Firstly i wont be going anywhere untill there is no silkroad.<br />They claim alot of shit, Yes silkroad has had some issues with downtime scammers blah blah but the operators of silkroad would have so much stuff to handle day in day out and they do the best they can from what i have seen in the year i have been walking the road, being &quot;THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST&quot; you can only imagine the kind of target they have on there heads from LE to Scammers and in between..... Good job SR Admin.<br /><br />They claim alot of shit, they can do things much better blah blah.<br />Where is the proof of these claims? sounds to me they are trouble makers who speak from there arse without anything to back themselves up.<br /><br />Have they previously had to deal with any of these issues they claim to be able to do so much better with?<br />Could there servers handle even a quarter of the traffic silkroad has running through it? if not then they will have downtime.<br />How would they deal with claims of scamming? from vendors/customers ect.... if its anything like the forums u better watch yrself.<br />How would they go dealing with a DDoS attack as we have seen here the last week? How about getting hacked if thats possible through tor?<br />How will they go with the temptation of millions of dollars worth of ltc/btc accessible on there servers? will the temptation become to great?<br />As DPR has said previously you cant just put servers anywhere or run the risk of being found so how will there handle growth?&nbsp; <br /><br />The biggest question, how will they go with a big target on there heads from LE? <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />They seem like are very immature people and are more than likely here for a cash grab than to put sweat and tears into making what they create the best it can be, I will link you to a thread started by Admin<br /><br /><br />Loera Admin <br />Topic: Exciting news! DPR buys Atlantis<br />http://atlmlxbk2mbupwgr.onion/index.php?topic=81.0<br /><br />Exciting news!<br /><br />We&#039;ve got some exciting news guys. Earlier this week we were approached by Dread Pirate Roberts (the owner of Silk Road) himself, offering to buy Atlantis.<br /><br />We have decided to accept his offer of over 9000 Bitcoins (totalling in at roughly $819,000 USD). DPR has many exciting plans for Atlantis, so stay tuned!<br /><br />Atlantis staff<br /><br /><br /><br />My final thoughts<br />Anyone who wants to go by all means go i hope you are treated with respect and dignity... Pfft<br />The less people that use SR the faster it becomes for me :)

The staff members at Atlantis and I are happy to address your questions.<br /><br />1) This belief has come into existence as &#039;Vladimir&#039; was a scammer on Silk Road and thus people thought I was the same person as him. Unfortunately without knowing Vladimir&#039;s past history, this is my name and the one I have chosen to use. Hypothetically if I was Vladimir, why would I use a scammers alias at a market place which deals directly with user funds? It wouldn&#039;t help build trust in our market place and doesn&#039;t make any sense at all. Its the equivalent of pirateat40 creating a new Bitcoin Savings and Trust scheme and asking people to re-invest in it. We&#039;re proud to say that in our 7 weeks of operation, we have suffered no down time, no users have lost funds and security concerns have been addressed promptly (like increasing PGP key support up to 16Kbits).<br /><br />2) We have deleted posts only related to spam, posts involving unfounded claims or accusations (FUD) and have deleted no posts in which people have given us criticism, bug reports or requests about improving security. You can check the relevant forum sections to find examples of this. We actively encourage this feedback as it helps us create a better market place. We are here to help users and are happy to reply to any security concerns or criticism you have. We have also created a sticky topic in the general forums for people to post whatever conspiracy theories they like. We will not be moderating this thread however the other forum rules still apply.<br /><br />3) We used the default term of service which comes with the forum software. You can find an exact replica when you download and install the SMF software. This has now been updated. <br /><br />4) We believe competition is healthy and believe that Dead Pirate Roberts is a great leader. We also need to shed the light that Silk Road has had technical issues in the past, even when we weren&#039;t around. Things like item listing image hijacking, denial of service attacks, site upgrades and switching hosting providers all caused down time. Although it would assist in us gaining more market share if our largest competitor is down, we have no desire to resort to dodgy tactics. We believe that what goes around comes around.<br /><br />5) The auto-encryption service only works IF the user or vendors uploads their PGP public key (we support key sizes of 1024 - 16384 bits). However, Atlantis also supports manual encryption outside of Atlantis in which users can use a PGP client to encrypt their message. Atlantis administrators and law enforcement could not decipher the encrypted message without the users private key. With all this said, the security comes down to the end user. If they don&#039;t trust the auto-encryption service, they can STILL manually encrypt the message outside of Atlantis and thus there is absolutely no risk of anyone being able to decipher the message. To this day, PGP with large key sizes (&gt;= 4096bits) is still uncrackable, you can find more information about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Security_quality. Noting: &#039;there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic or computational means.&#039;<br /><br />As stated earlier, if you have any concerns please don&#039;t hesitate to reply to this thread. Lastly, we&#039;d like to thank all the people who have put their trust in Atlantis and believe in where we are heading. The ride is only just starting and we&#039;re glad to have you as part of Atlantis :)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, what is the verdict?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, I hope that this is vlad being honest. On the other hand if there is just one thing to learn from my time in tor it is that people are full of shit. It&#039;s not that hard to bullshit people on an anon network. <br /><br />Part of why I trust dprs posts is because of their intelligence and brevity. <br /><br />Vlads post is really nice and eloquent.... just saying.

				I read the message by Vladamir (with his reasoning and claims) right after he posted it. After reading it, I am still left with the same belief. <br /><br />Before he posted this message, he previously stated that SR was the driving force behind Bitcoin when it was introduced. He had also said that the primary motivation behind Atlantis was to be the driving force for Litecoin. That alone should tell you who is behind it. I personally believe that Vladamir is closely linked with the creators of Litecoin...he probably knows them firsthand (which might lead to his downfall). I don&#039;t believe Atlantis has the resources to affect the Bitcoin weighted average to the extent it has been manipulated, but I know who does...Litecoin. It has been far from coincidental that the market has dropped (over the past couple weeks) every time SR is up and running. It should have gone up almost every time. SR customers and vendors trade/buy/sell thousands of BCs every day. SR isn&#039;t the majority of the market anymore, but it&#039;s still a big chunk, and drives much of the demand. <br /><br />84 million LCs going from $.01 to over $4 tells me they have the money to manipulate the BC market. Litecoin jumped almost $2 since the drama started. After following this so closely, I place blame on Litecoin, and not Atlantis (directly), for a trade war. Now, if only Bitcoin/Mtgox would adjust their formula (algorithm) so that we don&#039;t have such fluctuation. 200,000 coins traded shouldn&#039;t affect the market this much, especially when the vast majority of the coins sold during the slide are over what the weighted average will bottom out at. Conversely, it shouldn&#039;t go up $20 when there&#039;s only 60,000 coins traded.<br /><br />Makes me wish the Bitcoin developers would attack Litecoin to see how they like it.
