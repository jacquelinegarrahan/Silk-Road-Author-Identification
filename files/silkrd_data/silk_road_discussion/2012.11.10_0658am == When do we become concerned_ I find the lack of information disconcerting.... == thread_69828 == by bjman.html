				I just think it&#039;s strange that DPR or another admin hasn&#039;t been on to give us any sort of update on the site&#039;s status.&nbsp; Not trying to jump to conclusions or fearmonger.&nbsp; It just seems strange.

				One thing to consider is that there have been reports of intermittent uptime.&nbsp; I was even able to get to the login page once about 6 hours into the outage.&nbsp; If the site was....compromised, it seems like it would have been taken down in full.&nbsp; But that doesn&#039;t seem to be the case.&nbsp; The fact that some people have even been able to log in points more toward extreme load or major server issues.&nbsp; But still..why no update?

				Not much of a tech guy but if it was taken down by LE or even some hackers wouldn&#039;t they shut down the main site and forum? <br /><br />I&#039;m sure DPR and his team are rushing to get this fixed that&#039;s the reason they aren&#039;t replying.

				Definitely could be that.&nbsp; But considering that there are hundreds/thousands of people (and thousands of dollars in transactions) waiting on access, you&#039;d think they would take *two minutes* to come to the forums and say something.<br /><br />Anyone know if DDoS attacks are common or even possible on tor sites?

				Completely agree with that..as a vendor we would like to mark things in transit and see what your customers are saying, is there anyway the server can expand or is it not as easy as clear net?

				I think the reason DPR is always slow to make an announcement is he wants to remain unpredictable for security reasons.&nbsp; It&#039;s more secure to not announce when or what maintenance you&#039;re doing.

				doesn&#039;t matter to junkies why. All most of us care about is when lol. Take away our money and sources , you will have issues nobody wants to deal with. That was a joke this is a hypothetical question: If you were prolly millions of btc&#039;s on the plus side,nobody really knew who you were or where you were and you had slightest notion that SR was compromised what would you do? Run risk of being found out or walk away a millionaire? Most would say walk but in reality greed is very powerful and will keep you&nbsp; hostage.

I also hope this isn&#039;t the end, and I highly doubt it is, but I&#039;m certainly glad I only had 4.3BTC in my wallet. Although I do need to finalize an order or two.

				I would rather them silently fix the problem than spend a bunch of time telling us they are working on it. They acknowledged the problem earlier (before the outage) but they don&#039;t need to spend their time calming the herd themselves. It is up to us to remain calm and positive!

				Dude, chill out.<br /><br />Venders have more money tied up in escrow than you make in a whole year. Your little amount of money is inconsequential and frankly, you&#039;re making us all look bad. If the road is down, it&#039;s down. No amount of belly aching is going to fix that.

				If DPR wants everyones coins in the end this is the time to do it. If the road comes back online, there will be a lot less coins hanging on peoples accounts as this creates uncertainty.

				i agree, chill the fuck out.<br />yes, it would be great timing seeing that the site just had trouble a few days ago with registrations being closed, then back open. but could also be that the news of srs registrations being closed and then opened again made a ton more people register. also everything has server issues from time to time and im somewhat sure sr is not some huge company with 100+ employees. even google has downtime.<br />also, its saturday. we know nothing by now. the guy couldve been on a flight for 20 hours then got to bed and sleep 10 hours then get breakfast and so on.<br />i say wait at least until monday, before jumping to any conclusions.<br /><br />as far as sr going back up all le compromised, i dont think thats going to happen. just buy from trusted sellers and continue to use gpg, and all should be good even if the site was run on le servers. thats the genius part and why its so safe.<br />as for money, obviously there is an inherent risk. its an online drug market. still its very understandable that people get upset if they have bad luck.
