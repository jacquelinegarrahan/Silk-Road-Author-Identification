				Hi I am very much new and I am wondering if using a cellphone is safe for using SR, is it easier to trace a cellphone as opposed to a computer, I don&#039;t have access to a computer since I have a phone that I use for everything, I also noticed that certain links that were posted in the security forum isn&#039;t viewable perhaps because of my cell

				How would encryption be done with a cell phone? Like for your address. I have used my phone to browse but never purchase and never logged into my active buyers account.

				Wait a minute, Am I missing out on something here?<br /><br />You can view Silk Road on your smart phone? since when!?<br /><br />And that method doesn&#039;t sound very secure if you can in the first place, no PGP 4 U!

				You&#039;ll be fine if you&#039;re just browsing, even if you were being tapped, it wouldn&#039;t be too big of a deal if you were caught simply browsing. If you were caught making a purchase though, that could be really bad. <br />Just don&#039;t put too much faith in the encryption of the tor network and you&#039;ll be fine. <br />It would be a very stupid idea to make a purchase, or god forbid, access your vendor account, from a mobile network

				<br />I use the android app on my cell to window shop and plan my orders all the time, that way I know what I want and can order right when I get home.&nbsp; <br /><br />However I only place orders from home to use pgp. <br /><br />Wait, I&#039;ve placed one order on my cell, non encrypted&nbsp; with a trusted vendor. Had to do it, I placed a wrong order and wanted to correct it that very minute. All was well but I did not make that a habit.

				Whoa whoa whoa... does anyone want to tell me how its somehow &#039;&#039;risky&#039;&#039; to use the SR on a mobile network but fine to do so on a computer? Im almost certain these concerns are unneccesary. Your connected to the tor network and if your browser is setup properly you are getting the exact same result. When data leaves your device its encrypted and gets decrypted at the various tor nodes. And for PGP yes you can do it on your android. APG is the app.

If you have a smartphone, you can pretty much be guaranteed that your government has gone snooping around your texts and browser history before. It is widely believed that Apple and Google has placed a backdoor in their operating systems, something I don&#039;t personally believe but, given the power the CIA and other security agencies of our country have, its not too far fetched. <br /><br />Whereas in the case of ISP&#039;s, they need a warrant to sniff around, which is something that isn&#039;t handed out too readily.

				Google i dont believe would do that. I also think if there was a backdoor then a few of the millions of developers would notice and get the word out, or patch it for root users. Also While they do release search histories to authorities a vast majority of requests they do not. I understand what your saying. Texts, call logs and even browsing history is probably being logged and mined on a daily basis to &#039;&#039;protect us&#039;&#039;. But while on the tor network they arent seeing anything that is readable unless thry are operating a tor node. I guess if someone is really concerned they could only browse on wifi, but unless they are activley connected to your phone, taking screen grabs, theres really nothing they can see.

				Anyone who thinks using tor over a smartphone is somehow less secure than using tor on a laptop has a fundamental misunderstanding of how onion routing works.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, your ISP (in either case) cannot tell you are accessing silk road. At most they can tell you are using tor.<br /><br />If anything it would be more secure, as a greater threat to security is malware running on the same system, and malware is considerably less prevalent in the smartphone environment than it is on a Windows-based PC.

				Mobile hardware is insecure by design. Even Android, an open source operating system does not have access to the phone hardware. I invite people to read up on the issues the Replicant project are having when creating a free software mobile operating system that is transparent and open.<br /><br />For the tinfoil hat wearers among us, mobile devices are insecure because they use &quot;system on a chip&quot; modules which include a CPU, GPU, radio, audio hardware and other sensors rolled into one module controlled by firmware and drivers which are proprietary and opaque. Open source drivers do not exist because manufacturers cheap out by replacing hardware components with software which then contains trade secrets as they give price advantages over the competition. This secret sauce is not open to peer review, the drivers are seldom updated, most likely contain serious security flaws and such flaws can turn your device into a remote bug and tracking device.<br /><br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re using TOR if you browser&#039;s memory can be dumped over the network because the modem&#039;s RAM has no bounds checking. This is the case with the Galaxy SII, it&#039;s a hardware flaw that is hackily patched in Replicant.<br /><br />In short, unless the security community have the specs to the hardware and software then you should assume it&#039;s vulnerable. Unless you have a free software phone like an OpenMoko, it&#039;s just a matter of how powerful your enemies are.<br /><br />Having said all that, I&#039;m posting this from my phone.<br />

				Does anyone know what proportion of .onion traffic SR is responsible for? Is that public knowledge? I would imagine that would have a bearing on how deniable a position you&#039;d find yourself in.
