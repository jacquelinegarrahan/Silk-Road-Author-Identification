			<dd class="postbody">
				I stared a vendor account 6+ months ago, made 5-10 sales but discovered that selling on the road really isnt something for me. My question is would i be able to sell my vendor account, it is not like im selling a jacked up account with killer stats, i just dont think i will be using this account again and would like to recoup the money i spent to open it...... I would just like to know if this is something that is even allowed per SR rules and / or if this is something anyone would even condone. Trust me if there is a lot of negative feedback on this issue then by all means i would not consider doing it, i have been on SR for quite some time and would not want to mess up any of that. So send me some input, thanks!

				Every account that is created should be for the original creator or group.<br />I don&#039;t understand why it is allowed to sell used vendor accounts, or any account at all.

				I know someone willing to sell for only $300. Pretty generic name. Plus all his reviews are 5/5 - but he only has like 5 of them. I guess his hookup didn&#039;t come through so selling wasn&#039;t something he could really do. Account has only been around about a month.

				So i was doing some reading and i saw that when you get a sellers account the money you used as a bond is tied to BC, i looked at my account age and it shows as over a year old. First sale i made was back in august of 2012, at that time vendor accounts were 150 and the price of BC at the time was 10 - 11$ USD, so doing the math my bond would be worth close to 1300 - 1400$, now if i sold my account and the buyer met all the requirements to get the bond back they would also be getting that money........
