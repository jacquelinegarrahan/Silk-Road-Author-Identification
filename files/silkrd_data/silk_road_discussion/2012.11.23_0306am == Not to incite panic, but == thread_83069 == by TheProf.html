				URL looks good that was my first concern. I think what we have here is a brute force attack on the login page. The last time SR went down I believe it was someone using up all the resources after logging in with multiple accounts. Think they got the bad logins out ... now they are hitting the login page over and over with wrong userid&#039;s passwords in an attempt to disrupt.

				If it was hacked they wouldn&#039;t bother attempting to collect passwords this way.<br /><br />Hacking is very time sensitive. If the real goal is to steal money, they get in and get out quickly. <br /><br />A login page capture would be to obvious and probably pointless since they&#039;d have access to the full site.<br /><br />Once you get access to a database, you can always crack the password encryptions.

				Possible, however extraordinarily unlikely. First and foremost I have no clue how someone would spoof the main site address so that anything trying to connect to the real SR actually got redirected to the fake address...and I have to guess this would be an even more difficult task with TOR hidden services. The only way this could really be done is if someone had control over or at least access to everyones internet connections and did a man in the middle attack with ARP Poisoning, on each and every single computer in the world connecting to SR. On the other hand I noticed mention of brute-force and DDoS, brute-force is already highly unlikely to be efficient when performed on clearnet sites, I can only imagine trying to set up a brute-force client to connect to a hidden service AND somehow figure out how to properly limit requests so that it wouldn&#039;t DoS the site accidentally while trying out every combination of passwords and usernames possible while keeping it running quickly enough that you get past the 4 letters/numbers/symbols mark within the first 24-48hrs. Brute-forcing is insainly time and resource consuming, and if someone was able to get in and replace the main page with a phishing page, as someone else pointed out, they also have access to our password hashes...could take like 5 minutes to get 50% of passwords with rainbow tables for example, and no one would have a clue anything was ever wrong. When hacking, especially for monetary gain, the most important thing is stealth. You have to be about as stealthy if not stealthier than the vendors sending packages here. You slip up on that stealth with SR you MIGHT serve SOME time, or even just some probation...entirely different story in the world of hacking. If you arent stealthy enough to begin with, you&#039;ll never get in. If you get in and don&#039;t remain stealthy, you won&#039;t be in for long, you lose everything you&#039;ve worked for and possibly even get traced. After repeating that a few times, you end up with some very serious charges and possibly even a life sentence. If SR really gets hacked, we won&#039;t have such obvious signs, atleast until btc starts to go missing...unless they just want it down or it was done simply to show it could be done, in which case its more likely that there would just be a deface page than anything else.<br /><br />Hope my &quot;mini-rant&quot; gives relief to anyone fearing that SR has been hacked now or in the past, and on the other hand I agree with dbz4u about basically making up a team comprised of trusted users to work on specific sections of code.

				You ever notice your dick is angled 15% to the left? Seriously I am tired of seeing the same thing across the forums and learn to read:<br /><br />The capcha is not changing because the server is down, it can&#039;t access the server to give you more capchas its simply using the ones loaded in the loading page.
