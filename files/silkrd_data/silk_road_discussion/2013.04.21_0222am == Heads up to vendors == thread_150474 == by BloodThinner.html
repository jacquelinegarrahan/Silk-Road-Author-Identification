I know that nigge would have been banned no questions,&nbsp; Dude all I&#039;m saying last thing I&#039;m going to say is SR doesnt care if you make mad money as a vendor, but FUCKIN DO FUCKIN CORRECTLY.

				The last post is awesome.&nbsp; Why scare everyone. Just MSG the vendor or ask how it will be packed.&nbsp; <br /><br />We all see dodgy packs time to time.&nbsp; The biggest vendors have the least stealth due to their high volume.&nbsp; Small vendors take more time to pack, if you get the right ones. <br /><br />Almost every pack I got (67) is just a vac sealed bag inside an envelope.&nbsp; &nbsp;Looks like deadly ricin poison.&nbsp; So ya, an extra layer wouldn&#039;t hurt. <br />

				Aww,&nbsp; the thread had me scared that there was a serial vendor on the loose who is putting buyers at risk with dodgy packing.&nbsp; Glad it&#039;s not that.&nbsp; I was hoping to see who, so I can avoid those vendors.
