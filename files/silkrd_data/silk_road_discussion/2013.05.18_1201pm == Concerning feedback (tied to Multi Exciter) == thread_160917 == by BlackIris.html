				I took a look at Multi Exciter (ME from now on) feedback today because I ordered from him/her about a week ago and I found out his/her product was top notch (as I wrote in the feedback).<br /><br />So it was a surprise when I saw his/her score falling to 97.1% (instead of the usual 100%). I checked what could have happened and, lo and behold, and user gave 1/5 saying that ME DMT &quot;did nothing at 50 mg&quot;. Now, I personally tested myself the DMT at a low dose of 15 mg just to test the product potency at beginning plus after many other times and it&#039;s impossible (literally impossible) that the product &quot;did nothing&quot; at that amount. I have a lot of experience with DMT and I can testify that the DMT of ME is one of the best I&#039;ve ever tried (even from the odor you can understand it; when DMT is good it produces a sort of floral sensation, you neither need to smoke it to understand if it is pure or not). <br /><br />My post is meant to be addressed to all users that leave feedback: it is naturally your duty to yourself and the community to be honest on the feedback and give the score you think appropriate, but this doesn&#039;t mean that you should give a bad feedback for something that&#039;s much probably not the fault of the vendor. Everybody knows (or should know) that DMT the first few times is difficult to vap/smoke correctly and you can either obtain no result at all from smoking it if you burn it. Now, if you don&#039;t know what you are doing and you blame the vendor for this, this is cheap and totally inappropriate.<br /><br />You cannot give 1/5 to a product (that, as I said I tested personally, along many other users there) that YOU don&#039;t know how to use properly and damage the feedback of a vendor for your incompetence. This is NOT fair. Your feedback should be given in all honesty and respect, knowing that you have like a weapon in your hand and it should not be given lightly or without responsibility. Elsewhere what&#039;s the point of giving feedback to being with? If you do it lightly without considering all the parameters what&#039;s the point of leaving it at all? <br /><br />SR vendor&#039;s feedback is one of the most important aspects of the system IMO, and the instrument buyer have to understand who the vendor is like.&nbsp; If us buyers treat the feedback system lightly then we do first of all a damage to ourself as buyers, since by and by it would be difficult to differentiate vendors that are good from those that aren&#039;t (especially for what it concerns the product they sell).<br /><br />If the bad feedback would have been tied to shipment or similar I would have said nothing at all (because I couldn&#039;t know if something could have gone bad somewhere - there are too many variables in shipments - either if my experience even there has been perfect), but for what it concerns the product I know perfectly (by personal experience) that what the guy say cannot be possible and the fault is of the buyer (at last if there has not been a mistake somewhere, but in this case before giving negative feedback can you not contact the vendor?). Now, before leaving bad feedback for an error that is yours IMO you should research a little more if the fault is really of the vendor or it can be coming from something that is tied to yourself and only then (when you are sure) leave feedback (and it would be either polite to contact the vendor before so in the case s/he committed some error s/he can resolve the problem).<br /><br />This is not only for what it concern ME but it is a general issue I&#039;ve seen around with some buyers. If you don&#039;t use the feedback system with responsibility others will not be able to make an informed choice before trying the product themselves (so possible either wasting money). I used ME as an example because I know first hand the product so I can relate that with 99% probability the problem is not of the vendor in this case but the vendor was blamed for it.<br /><br />Weapons are not &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, they are neutral in themselves. It is the approach you have to them that change them in &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and it is the use you make of them that change its use from &quot;intelligent&quot; to &quot;stupid&quot;.
