				I&#039;m wondering if some sort of mandatory tutorial included in the registration process would contribute to solving some of the issues around bad behavior ie undeserved bad rating of vendors, scamming (check the forums before you buy, etc) It wouldn&#039;t have to be more than a page. Just a few emphatic guidelines to navigate by.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				you are going to have to include a 5-10 question test at the end to make sure that new people are using it, because all the info is already out there. I think that the best option to get people to use the forum is to change the market url and make it accessible only through the forum the first time, then users will have to at least come here to get the url to sign up for the market.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess you could leave the store URL where it is, but move the register link off of the page, and replace it with a link to the forum, with instructions on how to register/ the link to do so here in the forum!<br /><br />peace<br />18kct

				I think a two-part tutorial, one for etiquette and rules, etc, and one showing them how to install and use PGP. If SR needs a programmer for this ive done something similar before, i would do it pro bono...giggity
