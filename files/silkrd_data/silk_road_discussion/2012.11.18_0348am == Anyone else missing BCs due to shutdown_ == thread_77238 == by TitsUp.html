				Not being rude bud, but that&#039;s peanuts on what some people are waiting on. I assure you, DPR will sort it out you&#039;re just going to have to allow time for him to do everyone&#039;s payments etc. I spoke to him last night about my coins (and account being hacked) and he assured me everything was honkey dorey. I was waiting (well I guess I still am) on 150BTC just to put things into perspective for you. It&#039;s just one of those things you have to give it time, the man handles each payment one at a time and has to cross reference each one etc because it wasn&#039;t automated at that time.<br /><br />There&#039;s already threads on this too BTW!<br /><br />Hope this helps put your mind at ease a bit...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=77238.msg603364#msg603364">Quote from: TitsUp on November 18, 2012, 03:48 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> &gt;:(&nbsp; :(&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Anyone else still missing BCs that were deposited around time site went down?&nbsp; Happened to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to SR, so I deposited a small amount, just 5.35 BC, on Nov 9.&nbsp; My account still shows 0.&nbsp; I sent an email to SR support two days ago, after they said all deposits had been processed, but I&#039;ve gotten no response and still no coins.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious how special my situation is.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I like your name mate &quot;how ya havin it?&quot; ;-)<br /><br />You can make large as you want deposits now because it&#039;s all automated, DPR doesn&#039;t have to manually cross reference everything with the blockchain then look up your account and transfer it then individually notify you and so on... you see where this is going.<br /><br />It may mean shit to you but there&#039;s no dramas now at all, just don&#039;t send them straight from Bitinstant will you?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=77238.msg604455#msg604455">Quote from: TitsUp on November 18, 2012, 04:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> :-[&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />mea culpa!...mea culpa!...mea culpa!<br /><br />I apologize for not noticing the &#039;missing bitcoin&#039; thread (thanks oneiroi).&nbsp; If I&#039;d seen that, I wouldn&#039;t have started this thread.<br /><br />As far as my being concerned over my small number of BCs...I didn&#039;t care about losing that $60.&nbsp; It was a test deposit.&nbsp; Rather, I was worried that I couldn&#039;t trust the system and deposit significantly larger sums to actually make some purchases.&nbsp; I&#039;m anxious to do so, but needed to see my initial funds come through first.&nbsp; For those of you still waiting for your more significant losses, I sincerely hope and expect you&#039;ll get them back.<br /><br />Tits<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I must have missed a post somewhere about that, can I ask why bitinstant shouldn&#039;t be used? I&#039;ve only been using that method, so if there is a recent problem with them, I&#039;m definitely curious.

You should send the coins through a bitcoin washing service first (search for a good one on the forums, several have been given).
