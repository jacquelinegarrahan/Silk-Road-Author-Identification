				Same issue is happening to me. Hoping for the best, I&#039;m still waiting for 32 bitcoins to appear in my sr wallet. <br /><br />Oh wait, at time of writing I managed to get in - still missing bitcoins however, and the old long captcha is back it seems.

				I cliked on the &quot;click here to register link&quot; (yes, I already knew that I was about to see,&quot; New registrations are restricted at the moment.&quot;) and it redirected me to the home page displaying said error message, but it had a normal looking captcha. Tried it again and I logged in just fine. Hope this works for ya.

				I&#039;ve been able to fire off three messages to vendors in addition to some browsing.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t placed any orders.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been kicked off a few times, received the three number captcha.&nbsp; It&#039;s usable, fast, just a bit inconvenient with the session issues.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hope they get the bugs worked out.
