				It seems as though there has been a significant drop in listings lately... the most probable cause is the surge of new buyers (and unfortunately small amount of trusted vendors.) So I&#039;m assuming there was just a swift change in supply and demand... but did I miss a memo or something? I&#039;m likely just paranoid but many of my favorite vendors have no active listings and I&#039;m just trying to make sure there&#039;s not a marketplace migration I&#039;m missing out on or tricky LE mind games going on.

				Good point, MagicMan! <br /><br />It&#039;s likely that most pharmaceutical vendors are selling personal scripts or have access to a few scripts... so those quantities are generally limited. <br /><br />Paranoia strikes again! But hey, paranoia has worked for me so far!<br />

				The LSD section has been really low for awhile now :/ I would expect there to be a lot since there&#039;s such a high demand for it, especially for US vendors.

				I have noticed this as well - specifically in the opioids section. the number of selections have dropped like 20-30 listings since yesterday!<br /><br />either that section was enormously popular this past weekend (even more so than usual); or venders have been taking down their listings the past 24 hours.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine a dozen different venders all running dry in the exact same time frame. that would be quite a coincidence. and a sad one at that; considering many people, including myself, need their opioids!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />quite peculiar&nbsp;
