				First off, I don&#039;t post much (if at all) but I&#039;d like to state I&#039;ve been a regular forum lurker and a SR customer for a while now.&nbsp; Rarely do I feel like I should say anything on the forums but this is an issue that keeps popping back in my head.<br /><br />As I browse the forums in my spare time, I am constantly reminded of the past and how things are vastly different now.&nbsp; The modern day Silk Road isn&#039;t ancient, but the amount of change that has gone on since its birth is pretty staggering.&nbsp; In Silk Road&#039;s earlier days (in my opinion 10,000 members and under) the community was literally a 180 degree flip from what we have now.&nbsp; Everyone loved the idea of what Silk Road had to offer, and actually appeared to feel like they were working with something special.&nbsp; That seems to have changed, however.<br /><br />Nowadays for every one person who defends DPR and Silk Road as a whole, it seems like there&#039;s at least two paranoid, half tweaked out conspiracy theorists who immediately shoot said defender down.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get it.&nbsp; Why are the people here becoming so mean?<br /><br />I guess my question is this: Is everyone just going stir crazy and getting bored or has Silk Road&#039;s community actually degraded to that some kind of immature, name-calling, paranoid anarchy?&nbsp; Yes, the site is down right now.&nbsp; DPR said the site will be back up ASAP.&nbsp; This means as soon as POSSIBLE.&nbsp; Not &quot;as soon as you DEMAND IT&quot;.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing we can do about it.&nbsp; Honestly with how a portion of this community is reacting to this maintenance, if I were the Dread Pirate I wouldn&#039;t be motivated at all to get the site back up.&nbsp; And yeah I know it&#039;s a business but at the same time I actually believe he (DPR) wants to make a difference with this free market.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s all about the money for him, just like it shouldn&#039;t be all about the drugs or the money for everyone else.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess I just believe the community as a whole needs to relax and take a breather.&nbsp; Not just over this site maintenance but in the future as well.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t amazon or ebay.&nbsp; This is Silk Road, a hidden revolution that might change the face of the international war on drugs forever.&nbsp; We are all a part of something game-changing.&nbsp; No need to bring it down on ourselves.<br /><br />Anyway that&#039;s all I got, sorry for the additional thread. I may not even be making sense because I too am going through some nasty withdrawals. I just wanted to put that out there.&nbsp; Allow me to brace for impact.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />PR<br /><br />Viva la revolucion

				Excellent post and a +1 for you.<br /><br />I can understand peoples paranoia who have a good bit of monies tied up in SR and cannot access them which is frustrating.<br /><br />At the same time people need to chill their bean sprout nipples and calm the fuck down. An international black market will not bounce back in a matter of minutes, especially being by one man/woman/robot/alien/animal.<br /><br />Dank

				Good post, I reckon the people moaning are either kids who are pissed because they cant buy a gram of weed or people going through withdrawals like yourself.<br /><br />Admin really should kick these kind of scaremongers into touch every time but with it being an anonymous forum that would be difficult. Although maybe there are a few more people out there willing to police the forums, I would happily do this but I understand how hard it would be to trust anyone with that power.<br /><br />Short answer is people who take drugs a lot are not nice people when you take the drugs away.

				I&#039;m new here and have just finished my BitCoin &amp; Security studies when the SR went down.<br /><br />I&#039;ll just say a few words I already said in another paranoia thread:<br /><br />Regarding DPR &amp; the SR: I had my first MDMA &amp; LSD through a friend from SR. Even though I never actually made a purchase yet, I love this place with all my heart. I love what it stands for and what it tries to achieve. As for DPR: through some actions of his/her (even if he was just the catalyst), thousands and thousands of people had happy moments, me included. I thank DPR and the sellers, whoever they are.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the heat is around the corner as the site grows. I&#039;m sure there will be idiots who OD because of SR. I&#039;m sure the few will fuck it up for the many as usual. But I see SR as a step in the RIGHT direction and I stand by SR through its difficult times. As the OP said it: viva la revolucion!<br /><br />As for safety:<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;m not taking anybody&#039;s word for granted and I wish that nobody will take MY word for granted. I am rationally paranoid, which is much more efficient than dementia-related paranoia. I&#039;m paranoid because I want to be, while I&#039;m here.<br /><br />Ironically, this makes me a very happy fellow and I can&#039;t care less about any threat because I know I&#039;ve been diligently covering my tracks and so on.<br /><br />YOU are responsible for your own safety. And if you&#039;re a nice careful boy/girl, no amount of takedowns will make you lose too much sleep overnight.

				I think the angry and paranoid have calmed down since DPR updated us and was upfront with us.<br /><br /><br />I was really pissed, it was unacceptable to me how no one at the top was communicating anything.<br /><br /><br /><br />We always knew the risks of the site being taken down at any moment, and smart people had a wallet dump ready. It&#039;s just bullshit to have a site with this much business going on, with so much user money tied into it, and the community in riots because nobody knows anything. With the amount of revenue we&#039;ve gotten them, we deserve that much.

				Different forum, same drama.<br /><br />This unfortunately happens in every corner of the internet that I&#039;ve seen. You get an initial membership base that interacts well and treats itself in a pseudo-family way. Then the membership grows and you get a large mixed bag full of people. Some will bring positive things, some negative.<br /><br />When shit hits the fan, you can count on a lot of negative, jump-ship type posts. It happens. Those of us who know better than to FREAK OUT over every little bump in the road were laughing at the morons as they spun their conspiracy theories.<br /><br />I too hope that there was a silent majority just patiently waiting for the site to come back.

				Good call....<br />I think whats been said is bang on, DPR is trying his best to get the site back up.. let him get the site up. <br /><br />Honestly if we winge and winge etc , do you honestly think the site will be back up any sooner. <br />No is the short answer...<br /><br />Chill out and wait... like been said this isn&#039;t amazon or anything like that. <br />We are all in the same boat here .. <br /><br />Wait for the site to be fixed. <br />Patience guys ..<br /><br />What was said in this thread initially essentially covers my opinion on this. <br />Excellent post&nbsp; <br />

Yeah, there were a few trolls/newbie users on here making inane threads about the downfall of the Silk Road, but on every occasion, they were heavily downvoted and ridiculed by the rest of the community. <br /><br />Since I started reading the forums, there have always been a noticeable number of trolls and idiot users that can barely string two sentences together. In my opinion, a site like this is always can going to attract its fair share of nutjobs and conspiracy theorists, something I really don&#039;t think has changed much since the site&#039;s inception. <br /><br />I really think you guys are waxing nostalgia here, remembering the nonexistent &quot;good-ole days&quot; of 12 months prior (oh man, I was just a wee young lad back then!). And honestly, it reminds me of when my grandma gives me the &quot;when I was your age&quot; spiel about how wonderful 50s film, music, culture, etc.. was while conveniently forgetting the more troublesome side of her childhood (for instance, civil rights). It&#039;s called &quot;rosy retrospection&quot; and you fellas have it bad. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Honestly i think it has alot to do with the fact SR is so open and easy to find.&nbsp; Because of that not only are we getting newbies to SR but alot of newbies to the online drug market in general.&nbsp; &nbsp;I care to bet most of the people freaking out have had limited if any previous experiences with this type of market.&nbsp; Plus there really does seem to be alot of kids (highschool and younger) and let&#039;s be honest we all remember how much highschool aged kids are purely self centered to the core and love their drama.&nbsp; SR is something special and i believe it should be treated as so.&nbsp; That&#039;s just my opinion.&nbsp; SR personally saved my life by helping me recieve the meds i otherwise can&#039;t in order to eat and literally survive.&nbsp; Some of us are still here OP :)

I may not even be making sense because I too am going through some nasty withdrawals. I just wanted to put that out there.&nbsp; Allow me to brace for impact.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />PR<br /><br />Viva la revolucion<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sureno Vida!
