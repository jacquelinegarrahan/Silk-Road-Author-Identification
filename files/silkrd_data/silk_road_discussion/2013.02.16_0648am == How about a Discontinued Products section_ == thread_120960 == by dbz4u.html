				Bump. Anyone else have any interest in this? I&#039;m sure you guys remember things like Pepsi Blue, or Sticky Hands when you were a kid. There has got to be some love for things that aren&#039;t around anymore on here right?

				What about Crystal Pepsi?&nbsp; <br /><br />I like the idea and would love to see the throwback stuff.&nbsp; My question is how would you source it?&nbsp; And is there enough of a market for this?

				Not sure why anyone would want to go to the trouble of buying that stuff on here when it can be bought/sold on the white market.

				I like the idea as well, I&#039;m just not sure how you&#039;ll make money doing it.&nbsp; One area is over-the-counter medicine that gets taken off shelves.&nbsp; I remember people buying Exedrin Migraine when it was taken off shelves.&nbsp; Not sure the customer base will come on SR to buy stuff like that though.&nbsp; So I dunno, I like the idea in theory, just not sure it will be profitable here.

				Sounds to me like a case for the &quot;collectible&quot; section. Why not put it in there, the items you describe are some sort of collectibles and the category is empty (except the strange 12&quot; Horselington of nomad)<br />Try it, I think there is no real market for it but who knows - Like Thomas J. Watson was 1943 quoted, &quot;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers&quot;, I may be wrong ;)
