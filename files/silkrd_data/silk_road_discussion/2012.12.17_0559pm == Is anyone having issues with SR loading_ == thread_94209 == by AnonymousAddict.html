				figured I&#039;d add my $.02 - it&#039;s been spotty on and off for the past at least week or so across the board. I&#039;m also having problems staying on the Road. With the &quot;internal server error&quot;s and the &quot;problem loading page&quot;s, seems like it&#039;s a server thing. But the site is also speedier than it was before the overhaul, so maybe not all the hassle is for naught. :)

				I&#039;m having issues as well - not coming up even by switching identities.<br /><br />This conjecture in no way comes from any knowledge of computers and servers but I too have noticed that when I am on lately the marketplace is running much more smoothly than previously.&nbsp; I am wondering if they are limiting the number of users who can access/log in at one time and this is messing with initial access rate but also results in better browsing once you actually get in?

				yes, problems all the time.<br />I am a vendor and cannot have a good contact with my customers because it takes hours to login<br />Right now I try for over 6 !!!!!!!!!!!!!! hours<br />And yes, I am pissed because for a mulimillion dollar business/website its a disgrace.<br />When it does work I have to copy the orders and addresses to notepad because when I don&#039;t I cannot ship orders because.....the fucking site does not work an hour later. <br />YES I AM ANGRY BECAUSE NOW FOR 6 HOURS I TRY TO LOGIN TO TALK TO MY CUSTOMERS.<br />SR is taking a fee but its about fucking time they use that to make it work instead of making it worse than roulette.<br />

				I had issues getting to the login screen this AM before I left for work, but I&#039;m on now. Sometimes when SR is giving me crap I admit that I&#039;ll open 5 New Tabs all loading SR..... prolly doesn&#039;t help the overall problem.
