				So I make a deposit and go to checkout n after well over1.5 years, i forget my PIN:( no biggie, just create another account and make another deposit....but its only been 3 days and I&#039;ve lost money since BTC is on the decline, in 4 days I could lose all my $ if it crashes again, knock on wood....so Hedging funds for users that are waiting for PIN RESETS would make sense, rite? Maybe someone from SR Support will see this and change it for those who will forget their PINs in the future.

				its not SR fault the person forgot their security info... why should it cost SR money because they are trying to protect your acct?<br /><br />if it was hedged, then when btc went up you would expect for it to be unhedged and be upset when you didnt receive the increased value

However, expecting SR to take the hit on that devaluation is absurd. It is each member&#039;s responsibility to remember their own PIN; if they forget it, that&#039;s their own fault.<br /><br />When we purchase something here, the vendor can choose to have it hedged, and they pay a 4% Hedging Fee for the security that hedging gives them. Users do not pay a 4% Hedging Fee, so asking SR to hedge everyone&#039;s Bitcoin (which is what you would have to do because people could just claim that they don&#039;t remember their PIN so as their Bitcoin remains hedged until they wish to make a purchase) is an outrageous suggestion.<br /><br />You have to take responsibility for your own actions. Why the system should make a loss instead of the user, simply because that user forgets his or her PIN, is beyond me.&nbsp; ??? There are far too many people who expect others to take on that responsibility instead of taking on that responsibility themselves. I&#039;m going to assume that you&#039;re either in your late teens or early twenties; would I be correct? In my experience this generation (and indeed as a part of it I feel qualified to speak on the matter) seems to need everything done for them rather than taking on the responsibility of their own actions, and accepting that the consequences of those actions are their own.<br /><br />Take note of your PIN in future, and have the maturity to take on that little sliver of responsibility; take care of yourself instead of expecting (and sounding entitled in the process) the system to take care of you.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
