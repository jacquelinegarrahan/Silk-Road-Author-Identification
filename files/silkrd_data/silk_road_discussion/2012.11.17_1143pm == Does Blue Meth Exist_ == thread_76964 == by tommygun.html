				So, I&#039;ve never smoked Meth but has anyone here ever seen blue meth ala Breaking Bad Style?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />More of a curiosity question than anything&nbsp; ::)

				Blue meth COULD most certainly exist. Same goes for any color of the rainbow. It all depends what solution you use to crystalize. Throw in some windex, and viola, blue meth!<br /><br />(idk if windex would actually work)<br /><br />and I would personally stay away from anything blue..

				I&#039;ve heard people raving about purple MDMA before but never seen blue meth. I was actually browsing the road and saw something with a blueish tinge but that could&#039;ve just been lighting/backdrop&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;ve seen people make blue meth from them shitty shake and bake recipes, I don&#039;t remember what it is but it sure as hell doesn&#039;t compare to a real deal, big clear shard, lab synth.

				No blue meth most most definitely does not exist , any blue in a batch of meth would be from impurities / adulterants - and people just love to use color as a&nbsp; marketing ploy , but no it&#039;s just impure .

				Yes I&#039;ve done blue once before. It was some great stuff but no better than any other high grade glass.

				It CAN exist, but in Breaking Bad it&#039;s a plot device, especially as it&#039;s used within the context of Walt&#039;s ultra-pure crystal.<br /><br />Methamphetamine HCl is an amine hydrochloride salt, and should be colorless, odorless crystal.&nbsp; Any coloration is an impurity, and a chemist of Walt&#039;s caliber would never have allowed it in the final product.&nbsp; Using methylamine does not yield blue meth, but in BB there is a need to identify Walt&#039;s product from all others, so it is allowed that a methylamine cook will yield the infamous &quot;Blue Sky Meth&quot;.

				I seem to remember an old batch of speed called &#039;Pink Champagne&#039;. Pretty sure it was just a marketing ploy and food colouring. (at least the stuff i had). They even made a techno tune about it back in the early rave days..Haha<br /><br />Interesting topic!

				Did you notice the fuck up on that episode where Walter walks in along the bridge at the meth lab and says to Jesse &quot;What&#039;s up?&quot;<br /><br />and he&#039;s there with a hammer or some shit smashing a sheet of meth looking shit into shards saying &quot;just breaking the ice&quot;... but it&#039;s clear?<br /><br />lol... a small oversight there from the producers.

				I do not recall, now I want to go back and watch all of BB again just to find what your talking about lol.<br /><br />I just got a kick out of them having sheet&#039;s full of pristine &#039;ice&#039; that they had to bust up, and anyone that knows about crystal nucleation will tell you it&#039;s an asymmetric process.&nbsp; No way a sheet is gonna look like the surface of the ice in a fuckin hockey rink (I mean not unless they took a planar to the surface of it or something, read zamboni).&nbsp; That&#039;s why people have given it pseudonym&#039;s like &#039;shard&#039;
