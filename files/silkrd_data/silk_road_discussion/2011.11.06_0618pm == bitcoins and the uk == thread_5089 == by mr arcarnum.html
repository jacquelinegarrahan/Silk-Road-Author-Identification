				MtGox allow bank transfers as do Intersango. You could get their details and pay into their bank account from your branch but it will still take 24hrs to load onto your account.

				I&#039;ve heard that MtGox was requiring IDs when people wanted to make withdrawals from their accounts (US based accounts if I remember correctly but I&#039;m not really sure)<br /><br />I live in EU and used to buy bitcoins on Tradehill, but they&#039;re not accepting wire transfers atm, so I&#039;m looking for other alternatives.<br /><br />Has MtGox ever required ID from anyone in EU?<br />If yes, is it safe to open a real account and send requested documents since bitcoins are not illegal (yet&nbsp; &nbsp;::))? <br />Of course I&#039;ll be doing some tumbling afterwards. <br />Or maybe that&#039;s not a really good idea?&nbsp; ???

				You only need ID if you are withdrawing more than 100 coins a day. If I need a few hundred coins I tend to just withdraw them over a few days. Its a pain but safer.

				I am in the UK and have plenty of success using Intersango. Go to a town you dont frequent and pay cash into their Lloyds bank account. It is credited to your account within 24 hours (always sooner in my experience). You then order the coins which you will get within a few hours. Then tumble as required.<br />I dont see how it can realistically be any quicker or easier than this, particularly with a nascent technology such as this. Things dont always happen immediately, plan ahead. I know what products I want to order a week or so in advance, allow an extra day or so to get the coins and you are laughing. I dont see what the problem is to be honest.

				Why did it take so long? Wire transfer or what?<br /><br />I was thinking about giving MtGox a shot but don&#039;t feel like waiting another week&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Seriously, use Intersango (britcoin.co.uk). You dont need ID, you can pay in by cash, you get the coins within 24 hours or so. I dont see the problem, except that you have to get off your arse and pay into a bank account, although you can use internet/phone banking as long as you are careful with your mixing of your coins (which you should be doing anyway).

Finally the money hit my account about 20 mins ago, I bought some coins and am now waiting for them to appear in my SR account.<br /><br />As mentioned here before they now have a Lloyds account so you will not have the challenges that I faced. <br /><br />Long live SR!!!!!!!!
