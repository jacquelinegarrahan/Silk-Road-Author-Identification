				My first xanax was at age 16, prob not till 18/19 was when I started taking them definitley more then two or three times a week. After a year or so, I was taking them every day. I eventually stopped and switched to pain killers/heroin/methadone/suboxone. Today I&#039;m on vivitrol. <br /><br />In the last 48 hours I have taken 23 10 mg Valiums (mylan 477) (ten today all in one gulp). Now my main concern is where is the benzo buzz or chill sessh? Well with all the ten I took today I must say I feel out of it. I just ordered Listons sample Xanax and am hoping I have a good exp. I just think I&#039;m too tolerant. For instance, one time I think my parents back in teh day stole my bars, and if they didnt I hatre all 30 2mg pills... shouldn&#039;t of I been dead?<br /><br />Anway what is yalls opinion on benzo tolerance, like how long should you ahave to wait before expecting to see some kind buzz or whatever makes the drug entertaining in your body. <br /><br />

				Benzos are a bitch. My normal daily dose for the last 10 years has been 2mg klonopin, but today I decided to try for a buzz and ate 32mg klonopin and 10mg ativan in the last 12 hours. I&#039;m feeling a slight bit relaxed, but the upside is once I lay down I&#039;ll sleep great. This isn&#039;t an exaggeration or bragging on my part, just the facts. Once you have a tolerance to benzos, theres really not much you can do. <br /><br />However, I have noticed that only a few milligrams of ksalol xanax will give me a lot of that benzo buzz back. Not sure why or how, but they are potent little things.<br /><br />Not looking forward to the withdrawals.

				Its just impossible to feel that first high you want. I read you don&#039;t even get a high from &#039;xanax benzos&#039;. I objective in the case of that first high. Tolerance is definitley what gets us barre babies in the end. Been taking em for years now and I still have no self control when I have 30 in my hands. If i didn&#039;t have vivitrol to help me stay off heroin/opiates I prob would be dead. I dont know what Im going to do when I dont have vivitrol anymore!

				well I just wanted to say that this was very helpful. I thought benzos were made mainly to make&nbsp; you&nbsp; sleep. There is the buzz involved as they are anti anxiety medication and the whole purpose is to make you feel good. But you do develop a tolerence to them, so have I heard. I don&#039;t take them regularly so still get that high when I take them :)&nbsp; 8)

I know about that... after awhile that will fade though watch, keep taking them. I took my first xanax 2mg in 2004 and started taking em 2/3 times on average a week from 2006-2011 and I think it was about 2008 where I started not feelin that high so much, today that high barely exists. I won&#039;t fuck with 1mg pills. I can honestly take 30 1mg xanax&#039;s and be awake, I&#039;m not sure but recently I had 30 2mg xanax&#039;s and I either took em all or lost em, WOULDNT I BE DEAD ON 30 2mgs!!! or is that tolerance at its finest!!! word up
