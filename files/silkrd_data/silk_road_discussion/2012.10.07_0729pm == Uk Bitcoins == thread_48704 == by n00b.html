				Well I&#039;m pretty sure you can look around to find your answer, and 110 bitcoins so obviously got some money to put into it, can&#039;t you just swallow up an international transfer charge from your bank and transfer the money to intersangos euro account?

				I&#039;ve been saying to use OTC for some time now. Eventually the clampdown in the UK will spread to other states.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45622.msg491847#msg491847<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38319.msg488189#msg488189<br /><br />Solutions:<br /><br />Use search engines to look for OTC bitcoin in your jurisdiction.<br /><br />There are lots of these services. They should be used more frequently. Often they are less expensive, it is easier to remain anonymous, you have more choices... There is really no down side apart from the fact you need to check the OTC vendor ratings closely and wise up to any scams by doing a little research, same deal as obtaining product on SR really.<br /><br />P.S. First person to say &quot;but bitcoin is legal!&quot; has to go sit in the corner until they are sorry.<br />P.P.S. Scams really are more likely. Use services that allow you to judge OTC vendors like Web of Trust, Reputation systems, blah blah blah, all that good stuff. The black market is becoming more fiscally responsible nowadays, it&#039;s the 21st century, so get with the program and tell dodgy suppliers of drugs or bitcoins to go fuck themselves. Consumer power!

				I successfully used nanaimogold.com with cash (they only accept cash deposits) sent through a Western Union agent though the operation wasn&#039;t entirely painless.
