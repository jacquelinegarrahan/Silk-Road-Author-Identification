				Are there any? That we know are definitely silk road related?<br /><br />I see so much hype and fear behind them, yet the only documented stories I have read in the past about &#039;controlled deliveries&#039; are from people who for example: The school principle who ordered 8 LBS of weed in a single package to a education facility and his shipper didn&#039;t even bother to vacuum seal it or anything, - the package stunk.<br /><br />This being said, are there any documented controlled deliveries, or attempts at them. Any news links would be nice, and if an SR user has had any person experience with one of these, please do tell. <br /><br />After reading a thread about the high amount of cocaine residue on money, not to mention the volume of packages in hub centers that come into contact with one another that travel from different parts of the world....the chance of a package detected seems low depending on the area you live in, and how it is packaged. <br /><br />I also read of someone in finland whos package got intercepted(On these forums), 7g of weed, yet there was no mention of how it was packaged, whether it was vac sealed or not, etc.<br /><br />Please post any cases of reported controlled deliveries, or attempts, or news articles to people who have been busted for them. Lets try to really look into it and understand the true risk factor of getting busted, while taking into account flaws that senders made of the people who did get busted. <br /><br />I think it is best to judge the risk and chances of controlled deliveries based on actual documented controlled deliveries and not based on speculation floating around the forums. Any LE can come up here and spread false lies to scare people away making risks seem higher than they are.

				It is an absurd and fucked up situation, but they tend to use your signature as proof that you accepted the package. I have heard of cases where they don&#039;t try to get a signature during a CD and use other techniques, but very frequently they wait for you to sign before they arrest you. It at least seems like they use the signature as proof that you ordered the package. I have also heard of them pretending to be a neighbor who was delivered the package by mistake, and then asking you if it is yours and arresting you after you accept it. Of course if anyone has a neighbor ask them if this mail addressed to them is theirs, they will probably say &quot;yes&quot; also....

				I&#039;ve seen footage (and personal reports) of CDs where it was immediately obvious that the guy delivering the package was not your typical mailman. If the postal inspector plays the part, it can be tough to tell. However, when the cops do it, they usually wear the USPS (or UPS, whatever) uniform improperly, speak to you with an unreasonably harsh attitude, and the mail truck is nowhere to be found. If the so-called delivery person wants your signature as badly as you want what&#039;s in that package, I&#039;d lock the door in his face and tell him I&#039;m calling 911. Lots of push-in burglars pose as utility workers these days, you know :)<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;d never sign for anything or use DCNs, etc. unless maybe I was ordering weight. I&#039;d leave the package sitting on the floor with &quot;return to sender&quot; written on it, and wouldn&#039;t open it for hours.

				So again, because I signed a package that a guy who looks like a mail man rang my door, tell me I have mail and ask for my signature, they get to go as far as confiscating my computer? That&#039;s pretty fucked up. What if the package was framed by your enemy and he told the cops you ordered drugs, they intercepted it and tried to do a controlled delivery.... they then go in your house and you had nothing to do with it. They just took your computer that you ran your legit home business from and as a result you went without pay and got evicted from your house and were not able to buy any food. Fucked up....<br />

				You will never have to sign for a package on here, ever.&nbsp; Before you sign for a package you can obviously look at the sender/package/etc to see if it&#039;s actually yours or not. If it is a police officer they will most likely insist on you signing as quickly as possible and be forceful - not even allowing you to see the package.&nbsp; Just be smart, it should seem a little odd.&nbsp; As long as you aren&#039;t ordering pounds and pounds of drugs from the netherlands or some country in africa you don&#039;t really have to worry, especially if you deal with professional stealth-shippers.

				i seen that one of the venders INSISTS you use your real name and adress.

				They simply cannot get a warrant just because someone &quot;mailed you drugs&quot; when they can&#039;t even prove you paid for them or even wanted them.&nbsp; That&#039;s why they do controlled deliveries with warrants conditional on you signing.&nbsp; Read the intel around here.&nbsp; I am also a law professional and know how it works in the USA, more specifically this state.

				Hey folks,<br /><br />I ordered from SR once - planning on doing it again sometime.&nbsp; Anyways, there is a lot of debate on whether to use your real name or not.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t use your real name, <br />-what happens if you miss the shipment and have to pick it up and they ask for ID.&nbsp; If you use a fake ID you have just committed a serious crime, fraud and drugs together.<br />-the mail man may find it suspicious.&nbsp; (I would say this isn&#039;t that big of a deal.)<br /><br />I guess it depends on what your ordering.&nbsp; If your getting 100 grams of coke, obviously don&#039;t use your name, and send it to a vacant house or something.<br /><br />Anyways, I used my name.&nbsp; I had to pick the package up at the post office and I think I had to show ID.&nbsp; Best scenario is if you have a mail box in your door i guess!

				It usually takes 2-3 days per delivery, I wait to ask them to ship the next until after I receive mine.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know, i&#039;d rather them (if somehow they caught me) be like &quot;oh a gram of coke he must be a casual user&quot; rather than &quot;HOLY SHIT IT&#039;S A KILO OF COKE SWAT TEAM NOW!&quot;

				It is my understanding that controlled deliveries, all the rage in the 90&#039;s and early 00&#039;s are no longer favored by law enforcement. A few years ago there was a rash of random pot mailings to prosecutors, judges, politicians, and law enforcement personal that did cause some very high profile and messy controlled deliveries of the wrong people. There were also indicants of postal and package delivery employees being murdered because they were suspected of being in the process of making controlled deliveries. This made the postal/package unions very upset and has dramatically limited their corporation in these types of deals. I believe one of the unions sued to stop them in one case. I am of the understanding from very reliable sources, that a knock and talk or a major field investigation is the preferred route after a package is detected. My source who works for a top 10 US city police department says they have a policy prohibiting controlled deliveries.

				I agree completely and those are my main points as well. Deny a package if you have to sign, don&#039;t check DCN unless there is an urgent issue, and encrypt that computer!&nbsp; If you can get a hidden OS going (easy with truecrypt) then even if the worst happens and the court orders you to unencrypt - bam, perfectly clean OS&nbsp; ::)

				My tactic to protect against controlled deliveries is just not to answer the door if I&#039;m expecting. If I expect a package from an SR vendor and I&#039;ve made sure it doesn&#039;t require a signature then I&#039;d just let them knock and then go away. If it&#039;s a legitimate delivery they&#039;ll leave a card (in my country) and if I wanted I could go collect at the post office. In this scenario I probably wouldn&#039;t depending on what I&#039;d ordered. But even if you did it&#039;s highly unlikely they&#039;ll station officers at the PO for weeks following a failed CD attempt, plus the variables would be too great for them and not controlled.<br /><br />Should you ever find yourself in a situation where you&#039;re face to face with them and they want you to sign just make sure you step outside, close your door behind you, and refuse to sign. Don&#039;t engage them in a conversation, just be respectful, say you aren&#039;t expecting a delivery and don&#039;t sign for packages unless it&#039;s something you&#039;re expecting. And if they won&#039;t let it go just say &#039;if that&#039;ll be all&#039; and ask them to leave. At this point, you haven&#039;t done anything wrong. They can either arrest you for being paranoid, try and bait you by saying that there were drugs in the package and they want your ideas on &#039;who might be sending you contraband&#039; or they&#039;ll go away. Yes, they&#039;ll think you&#039;re being a little strange, but that isn&#039;t a crime. Lying to them and then it later being found out that you lied, is!<br /><br />Usually, like with most police work, they&#039;re attempting to bait you into saying something incriminating. Don&#039;t fall for their games.<br /><br />If CD&#039;s are something you&#039;re genuinely concerned about just make every attempt to make yourself as immune as possible - i.e. don&#039;t keep a shitload of drugs in your house if you&#039;re expecting a delivery, use correct and efficient encryption techniques, including the use of hidden volumes as an earlier poster said, and don&#039;t let them talk their way in with lines like &#039;well if you&#039;ve got nothing to hide...&#039; - tell them they&#039;re called privacy rights for a reason and if they want to come in, to get a warrant.<br /><br />Also, I find it good practice to learn the encryption laws where you are. There&#039;s always a lot of talk about RIPA in the UK, but it can only be executed after they&#039;ve got good probable cause (not signing for a package not being one of them), and they have to require written notification. Should they get to the stage where they&#039;ve managed to get a warrant but not found any drugs in your apartment they&#039;re unlikely to get authorization to seize your computer unless it was in the original warrant, even then to have you decrypt it requires more paperwork on their side. Also, check the search warrant, some cops will try and tell you it includes things it doesn&#039;t. And on the point of RIPA, if you&#039;ve ordered something that carries a massive penalty if you were caught trafficking it it&#039;d probably worth your while just refusing and taking the RIPA jail time if it&#039;ll be less than the jail time for whatever you&#039;re hiding (i.e. information about ordering a shitload of really illegal things).<br /><br />Now I&#039;m just going on...I have more tips, if you&#039;re really worried PM me.

				&quot;Maybe it doesn&#039;t work that way at all, but if it doesn&#039;t, then I&#039;d like to know why.&quot;-<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t work that way one bit.&nbsp; If Mr. Ronin-at-law was even a failed first year law student, he could have told you that.&nbsp; But I digress on his negligent behavior towards our community.<br /><br />The why is deeply philosophical.&nbsp; Instead, I&#039;ll tell you the what.&nbsp; The way it works is a criminal defendant is presumed innocent.&nbsp; And in no way must provide for an affirmative defense.&nbsp; The defendant does not have to testify as to his innocence, or prove his innocence with any demonstrative evidence.<br /><br />In criminal proceedings, there are two basic levels of what level of proof is required by The People of the State of (whatever state).&nbsp; The first is a preliminary hearing.&nbsp; This is where the judge reviews the evidence to ensure that probable cause exists.&nbsp; Probable cause is the level or proof that needs to be met in order to allow The People to take the criminal defendant to trial.&nbsp; Probable cause is basically a reasonable suspicion that the defendant committed the charge.&nbsp; It&#039;s at the judge&#039;s discretion.&nbsp; It can usually be quantified around 10%-40% likelihood of guilt, but it can&#039;t officially be quantified.&nbsp; Once at trial, the burden of proof in order to convict the defendant rises to proofs beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In other words, there is no other reasonable hypothesis that points to innocence.&nbsp; This burden of proof can&#039;t be quantified, either.&nbsp; But many people would place it at 90%-95% likelihood of guilt.<br /><br />That&#039;s a very very very basic 101 on what kind of proof is required in order to take a criminal defendant to trial.

				That&#039;s a lot of pontificating. <br /><br />If you actually have actionable advice, you would simply give it instead of all that huffing and puffing. You have to admit, you could have handled yourself better. You&#039;re not doing much to engender the trust of the community. In fact, your self contradictory statement about ethics makes you look double-minded and untrustworthy. Good luck with your &quot;listings.&quot; I would steer people clear from you if they asked for my opinion. <br /><br />Might be a LEO trap. <br /><br />BTW, hypothetical situations ARE actionable.

I hope no one takes you up on anything you have to offer. It might be the end of them.&nbsp;

The market has no need of your services. Certainly not in the manner in which you&#039;re offering. <br /><br />I mean, I can&#039;t imagine a compatible scenario where someone goes, &quot;Oh shit! I&#039;d better log on to SR and buy that guy&#039;s legal services before it&#039;s too late. Else, I&#039;m assed out. Good thing I didn&#039;t spend my bitcoins on drugs yesterday.&quot;<br /><br />Emm-mmm. Not going to happen. <br /><br />All&#039;s not lost though. This place has a wonderful assortment of drugs. Whatever you&#039;re into, I&#039;m sure someone sells it. I invite you to get high. No worries, you can thank me later.
