				okay okay.... i&#039;m all about celebration but i gotta be all downer... just the massive spewage of chemical toxicity speweeed.. shit.. i saw it for miles n miles....<br /><br />beyond that... it was fuckin cool! was on a MAIN couple of free way inter states... and there was blasting in the sky all the way. i was like wtf! very cool.<br /><br />I managed to insufflate some 5 or 6 honkers in the first 90 mins of a 5 hour drive (while driving. I drive with one kneww and chop up on a book with my atm). kept my compsoure the rest of the way home. amazing i know. and finished the rest now. <br /><br />So happy fucking pretend freedom day. ALthough this place really makes me feel FREE!<br /><br />Let this place flourish, succeed, allude dick fags (love you real fags :), and continue to flabergast the punk sad hurting inside individuals who can only seek to infringe on others. they will wake up someday guys. they will. someday commerce won&#039;t be our game. it&#039;ll simply be chillin, connectin, learning, and honoring. <br /><br /><br />peace<br /><br />

				The irony of Americans celebrating independence day when your civil liberties are being taken away at rapid pace, left and right. It&#039;s like the Orwellian double think. Happy 4th July to all the soldiers of freedom, the war against tyranny and imperialism just begun.
