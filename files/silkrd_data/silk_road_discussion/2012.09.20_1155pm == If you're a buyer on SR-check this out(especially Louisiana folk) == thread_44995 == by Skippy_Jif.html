				When I first started on SR as a vendor with just about no revenue, but a decent amount of drugs I catered to as many people as I could to get my name out there. Not only that, but I am an overall great guy to work with. With that being said I gave a lot of samples out and was lenient with many buyers.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I gave a buyer named lledd a sheet of blotters because he was &quot;coming into money.&quot; I kinda knew this was BS, but I gave it a shot anyway. That was over a month and a half ago. <br /><br />He has strung me along with all this bs about paying me back and hasn&#039;t. So, I&#039;m going to make this short, either you(lledd) pay me back by tomorrow night the $110 or YOU AND YOUR ZIP CODE AND OTHER ZIPS AROUND YOU GET BLACKLISTED FROM SR.<br /><br />You may get away with a couple of vendors on here selling to those zip codes on SR, but not all. So, it is up to you to repay that money or you go on the Scammer log.<br /><br />Buyers, if you&#039;re in the state of Louisiana and you like getting your drugs from SR then ask lledd what he plans on doing about this. I haven&#039;t been malicious in anyway, but now my patience is played out. I won&#039;t have another scammer screw me over especially someone that 1+ me in forums thinking that it will suffice as repayment. <br /><br />He has until tomorrow night. Since tomorrow is Friday and that is typically payday I&#039;m sure he has the cash.

				So I&#039;ve checked this out, and I&#039;ve learned that you are an idiot, and I don&#039;t see the point of this topic. It only makes you look stupid.<br /><br />Here we see a vendor, this is someone we are supposed to be able to trust with our name and address, act dumb enough to fall for such an obvious scam, you yourself said &quot;kinda knew this was BS.&quot; NO FUCKING SHIT. You&#039;ve also kept his details and talk about blacklisting, way to inspire buyer confidence. You got done, learn, don&#039;t throw your toys out of the pram and make a spectacle of yourself.<br /><br />Ps.<br />You can buy bitcoins at mt. gix.

				He&#039;s talking about adding him to the blacklist in the vendor forum.<br /><br />I do think it&#039;s silly that he&#039;s trying to make innocent people pay for his ignorance, though.

				Skippy_Jif, IMO this post and behavior is unacceptable.<br /><br />Saving addresses is the worst possible thing anyone can do on SR, unless, of course, they also decide to post said address on a forum.<br /><br />This also completely undermines my confidence in you as a vendor. I can say that I will never buy anything from you knowing that you have saved somebody&#039;s zip code.<br /><br />Also, NOBODY should let them-self get scammed that easily.<br /><br />Please just accept it as a sunken cost and a lesson learned.

				Well, I suppose it&#039;s naive to assume your information will not be held as insurance. It should be deleted when escrow closes at the latest, but as soon as the label is printed is preferable. <br /><br />Any vendor that is willing to blacklist an entire area over such a small amount, knowing they were most likely being scammed, isn&#039;t worth the risk. A shame, too, as I heard you have some pretty good white.

				Yeah putting a users location out there is never appropriate under any circumstances. Not cool behavior for a vendor. It goes without saying that scammers will always exist on SR, but a smart vendor learns the rules to avoid them and that&#039;s that. If you get a bump or bruise along the way in the learning process chalk it up to evolution and keep it moving, there&#039;s money to be made here!

I don&#039;t have his information! I only have his zip code! I DON&#039;T KEEP CUSTOMER INFORMATION!!!!<br /><br />The problem with a lot of people on the internet is the fact they come up with these insane theories! You can be sure of some vendors pulling this shit, but there are a lot of good people that sell. The problem is buyers can&#039;t tell because they can&#039;t get into the Vendor section.<br /><br />Now to the people who have called me an idiot and all the other bullshit that I could care less about, but since I have some time and I&#039;m high from all the drugs and free time that I get from all of your money(YES I AM BEING A SMART ASS BECAUSE THAT STONE WAS CAST BY Y&#039;ALL). If the fucking shoe was on the other foot there would be a complete bitch fit and other people chiming in about how they got screwed.<br /><br />But nooooooo!!! When a vendor gets screwed he needs to suck it up and be called a twat for being so naive. Well, I already said I was, so I beat you guys to the punch. A scam is a scam. It doesn&#039;t matter who it is, but if the person didn&#039;t have it coming to him/her then it is completely disrespectful!<br /><br />The fact is I get on here and every day I hear someone crying over how they lost money from a vendor that screwed them over. Hell! A few times I have even given free samples to ease the pain of buyers who lost money to other vendors. YES! That is 100% true. I felt really bad for some SR members that I shipped them free drugs and they have loved me for that ever since. Was it to bring them in to be a future customer? Yes and No. Yes because I am on here for 2 reasons: To buy and sell drugs! No because I am here for 1 reason: To make an unbreakable bond with people I will never meet IRL and show them that there are GOOD people in this game we play. Apparently not many with the ass clowns that posted in this thread.<br /><br />ANyhow, I am done ranting about this and if I choose to not ever ship to that zip code then it is my motherfucking choice and you guys can bitch about it all you want. Tough Titty! But DO NOT get on here saying I have broken any goddamn rules! Because I haven&#039;t! I haven&#039;t listed any information besides the name of the scammer and the state. NO rules broken. And I DON&quot;T KEEP CUSTOMER INFORMATION!!! So knock that off because that is how reputations get shattered and vendors survive off of their reputation.<br /><br />I know that some of you guys could care less about this, but you&#039;re all banned from buying from me. This includes all my VERY NEAR FUTURE listings. And they will be very good! I will be a OneStopShop in the US and you can bet your asses that you will be enticed regardless of the names you call me while you&#039;re reading this and those. Will I be able to know who is who? No, but I&#039;m making a fucking statement!<br /><br />Guys, this business is far from easy! Especially when I have to get on here daily and boost&nbsp; and maintain a reputation for being a good guy that sells good products and has stellar communication!<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m done ranting and I have no more bad blood w/ anyone. Everyone have a great weekend and be safe!<br /><br />SJ

				I understand the need to do this Skippy Jeff, but there is a much better way of doing this. It&#039;s just I haven&#039;t written the damn code yet.<br /><br />It is possible take people you think are scammers, SHA hash their addresses in such a way, and then delete the address/info. Then when they try to scam you again, you can hash their address and do a comparison, if you find a match then you tell them to go fuck themselves. This way scammers have to obtain numerous addresses to perpetuate scams (and I can employ fuzzy hashing to make this problematic for them unless they are ready to move to an entirely different zip code or obtain expensive services which since they are buyer scammers is highly unlikely)<br /><br />The power of this approach is greatly magnified if you share a black list of hashes with everybody, it should cut down on SR scammer buyers by a large factor. Even a naive implementation would deter most scammers, but we really need a clever implementation to box them in proper for good.<br /><br />I was working on a project to completely automate this process, so that everybody could share lists of scammers and make black lists. Because there is no actual addresses involved, this could be all public and in the open. There are a number of caveats such as a reverse address to hash attack, so there is a danger LE might be able to decode the black lists, but the idea is basically sound if I can work out a way around that attack I think.<br /><br />It would be good if SR vendors could use spreadsheets to keep track of data without storing address information, making interception of your accounts futile.<br /><br />Anyway, it is on the to-do list. I shall try and do it this weekend and then I&#039;ll hold a mini-conference on the subject for input on the consequences of its use etc.<br /><br />P.S. Obviously this will be open source and posted on the forums so the code is capable of being inspected by anybody.<br />

				Thanks Christy and Pine! I never sell on the side(not anymore), but that one time. It was a stupid decision that I just kinda edged in because I was coaxed into it. I was a noob and got taken for my inexperience. I&#039;m happy to say I learned my lesson.<br /><br />I just want everyone to know that I didn&#039;t give any information out besides the state. No zip code, no name, no address simply because I don&#039;t have any of that information besides the zip code.
