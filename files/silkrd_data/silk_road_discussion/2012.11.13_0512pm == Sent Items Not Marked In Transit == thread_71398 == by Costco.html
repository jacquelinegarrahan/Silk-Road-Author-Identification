				I reluctantly sent costco a pm asking if my measly $100 order had shipped before the site went down because I was last on friday morning and it was still processing and was just curious if I should be expecting it or not.&nbsp; I know he has more important things on his mind than my order but I figured I&#039;d ask.&nbsp; He responded quickly saying he had and now I see this thread.&nbsp; I want to thank you costco for the quick response and let you know I will finalize as soon as I am able to.&nbsp; Hopefully DPR finds a solution to this problem.

				Same problem here. I mark as shipped once shipped and my last batch of orders were not marked shipped before the site went down. Unfortuantely despite being in the top 7% of vendors I cant access the vendor forums since I only sell research chemicals.

				FYI for customers awaiting shpments from...<br /><br />If you placed an order before 10AM on Friday November 9th, you order WAS PROCESSED AND SHIPPED. If you haven&#039;t already, you can expect to receive your purchases today!<br /><br />Any purchases placed after 10AM last friday, we have not had a chance to see it, therefore, it&nbsp; will be processed as soon as SR is back online.<br />

				I&#039;m still waiting to finalize with a vendor. I got my order so fast I still had to wait 2 more days to finalize! Now I feel bad he&#039;s not getting paid!<br /><br />I&#039;ve got 3-400 tied up in my account and escrow right now. I feel bad for the vendors that are sitting on thousands and thousands.

				Since there is no telling when SR will be up again, an update for our customers:<br /><br />All orders placed with us until last Friday, 15:40 UTC, have been shipped on Saturday. The last few orders couldn&#039;t be put in transit since SR went down but they were shipped nevertheless.
