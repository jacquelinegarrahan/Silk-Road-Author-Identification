				I placed an order with a vendor today...But I want to try and get a refund because of security reasons....Can a cool vendor refund you same day you place an order if you message them and they didn&#039;t send your order out yet?

There is no obligation for them to cancel any order though, so if they decline, you&#039;re out of luck. If the order was just placed and they haven&#039;t begun to process it there will usually be no problem.

				A vendor can cancel. What are these security concerns? Most are usually overly paranoid as you can prob tell from the forums if you read a few threads.

				So my vendor got back to me, said he would refund me no problems.<br />Then he messaged me again saying he accidentally confirmed my order instead of cancelling it.<br />He said he will do whatever is necessary for me to get my refund.<br />I messaged SR Support and pasted his messages.<br />I see on here everybody talks about some a resolution center for disputes.<br />This technically isn&#039;t a dispute,just a mistake, and for some reason I can&#039;t find this resolution center on the site.<br />Should I be looking to message another system other than SR Support or am I good?

				Just give him your wallet address and he can transfer directly back into it. That way there is no dispute lodged, as there is not actually a dispute.

If he issues you a refund through the resolution center your refund rate in your stats will increase.<br />You will be required to finalize so as the order doesn&#039;t auto-finalize in 17 days time, which would also put a black mark on your stats; might I ask the name of the vendor in question? If it&#039;s a new vendor I&#039;d be a little wary of the entire situation.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Yeah that is what I meant, but thanks for expanding if I didnt make myself clear. <br />Personally I would tell the vendor to put coin into my SR acct and I will then release the funds which are in escrow. Its easy enough to do and neither loses out.

				As long as you didn&#039;t finalize it, he can still cancel it after marking it as in transit using the never sent option if I recall, then you would be immediately refunded.

A vendor can cancel anytime up until the order is finalized, even if marked in transit using the never arrived or never sent options.
