				apparently BZ was tested by the US Government just as LSD was on the public without their knowledge... i did a little web search a week ago and found out it is supposedly 100X stronger than LSD (10 micrograms active dose or something like that) and it lasts 3-4 days with after effects lasting a month or so. this is the strongest hallucinogen known to man but it is so crazy (terrifying hallucinations and thought processes) that it could be considered a WMD. <br /><br />i just found this interesting cus im sure most people have never heard of BZ. if you guys look it up or heard some crazy stories about it, id love to hear what you go. peace and love

				Yep, it was tested as part of the MK-ULTRA program, but the &quot;on the unwitting public&quot; tends to be exaggerated. They only did that in two brothels for a limited time. Mostly they performed tests on mental patients in psychiatric hospitals.<br />

				If i recall correctly BZ is an anticholinergic &quot;deliriant&quot; along the lines of datura. Or to put it another way, you don&#039;t want no part of that shit.

				From what I remember, according to the movie , - a LSD chemist got busted in california during viet nam war.&nbsp; He was punished to join the army and assist with chemistry .&nbsp; <br /><br />This LSD chemist worked with others to develop BZ .&nbsp; In the end the soldiers it was given to , started killing each other instead of the enemy.&nbsp; There was a few survivors .<br /><br />

				Eddie&#039;s right, as usual, it was a deliriant, not a hallucinogen.<br />links break: edited, look it up.

Infinitesimal amounts could send people into total mental disorder. BZ is an anticholinergic, similar to atropine or scopolamine, which are used in medicine today. At high doses, such drugs trigger delirium—a dreamlike insanity usually forgotten after it subsides. Sim, one of the first doctors to try BZ, later proclaimed that it “zonked” him for three days. “I kept falling down,” he said. “The people at the lab assigned someone to follow me around with a mattress.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				It&#039;s been about 20 years, but I think I remember reading that BZ, along with LSD, were being tested by the government in 60&#039;s in hopes of developing a &quot; truth serum &quot; . With the cold war and the threat of spies, US needed a way to make people tell the truth. These days, I think we just find water boarding to be more cost effective to the tax payer.&nbsp; ;D
