				It seems that I have been banned from SR for reasons that I considered invalid.<br /><br />The first vendor who I was extremely happy with told me that he was unable to fulful an entire order of 200 due to a a trafficc accident and/or a miscue with his partner. I said that I was somewhat apprehensive because &quot;synthetik&quot; used the same sort of circumstances/explanation to delay putting bitcoins into my SR account. Many Canadians were ripped of by synthetik and you can see in the &quot;Rumor MIll&quot;&nbsp; He was not amused needless to say and if memory serves, he was going to send batch one. I don&#039;t know what the plan was with batch 2, I t was a fairly large order of clonnies and I even offered to fe but he wouldn&#039;t hear of it. The account that I use for buying is &quot;savantlake&quot;is locked I can no longer see where we are now.<br /><br /><br />The second issue goes back a month where another vendor eas to send be 100 clonnies. He asked if I would fe which I did because it was my first order (pls no lectures onfe&#039;ing) I fe&#039;d as soon as the system let me and in turn he was going to prepare the the package for me to dend off thr nrxt business day. Well that didn&#039;t happen and a week later I asked him if my package had been sent out. A week went by and it turned out that he had sent nothing out despite the assurrances that it did. So I suggested thst he was a liar for twice not sending my stuff out saying that he did.<br /><br />So now my savant lake account has been locked out. I don&#039;t believe that I deserve this as in my short time I&#039;ve been nothing but a top-rate buyer. my only refund was purchasing somethis from a vendor who in his addclaimed that he shipped to Canada but didn&#039;t afterall.<br /><br /><br />EDIT - IT&#039;S WORKING NOW!

				Didn&#039;t you get the memo? SR doesn&#039;t have to have a reason that you agree with. <br />Sorry, not trying to be a dick, but it is what it is.<br />Edit - Glad it&#039;s working for you now though
