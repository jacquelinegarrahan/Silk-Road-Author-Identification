			<dd class="postbody">
				I am looking forward to getting started on SR as a seller but there are a few things keeping me from moving forward before I get started. First, it costs 31 BTC just to get a seller account, which is about $150 USD. I understand why it costs money, but seems kind of expensive. Since I do not have any BTC to start out with could you give me some recommendations for getting my initial account setup? Are there any other ways besides finding an exchanger and go through the motions of funding BTC anonymously? <br /><br />The second, and most important, concern of mine is that all the sellers on SR seem to have a lot of feedback. Will people even purchase from me since I will be new and a few others sell the same thing? I am not worried about getting it shipped promptly, etc, that is priority, but I worry that it might be a lot harder to become a seller (that actually has buyers) on SR then it seems. I fell like it might only attract buyer scams. Any advice / insight would be appreciated.<br /><br />As for buyer scams, I have read about the finilization, but I also read a thread on these forums that was a buying guide. The guide said once a buyer has more then 5 purchases , NEVER finalize until I receive product, even if vendor has a lot of feedback, and that if they won&#039;t ship until you finalize, then cancel order. This is confusing because most of the vendors I saw on SR required it to be finalized before shipment, so which is it? And since I will initially be building up my reputation how can I avoid buyer scams where the buyer will just say that they never received?<br /><br />Looking forward to your replies. As for precautions / security that need to be taken, I am well versed on all of that already, and already setup.

This listing here should be good<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7e488e3b63<br /><br />As for your feedback, yes sales will be slow at first but if the demand for your product is there, people will buy it. So for example if you are selling MDMA at 13btc a G and someone with 1000 sales is selling it at 13 a g, you won&#039;t get shit. But if you start selling at 10-11 a G you will get customers because there are plenty people on here, like me, who are poor enough to care about that difference.<br /><br />On finalization. Noone is going to FE for you until you have proven yourself. However, you are right that you could be targeted by a scamming buyer taking advantage of your trustworthiness. Therefore I advise that you remain in escrow for people with 5+ purchases etc and ask new buyers to finalise early. That is fair enough in my eyes.<br /><br />Also, even when you are proven, many people will want to stay in escrow. Especially since this new tony76 scam (if you dont know the no.1 vendor on here scammed everyone for about $200,000) - you will be hard pressed to find people that will FE for you. Maybe they will after a few transactions with you.<br /><br />If you want them to FE for cash flow issues, you could offer 10% extra for people that do so! (many other vendors also do this)<br /><br />To advertise your product and get your name out there, I recommend you do some free samples to people that are active on the forums, and ask them to do a review for you when they receive their product. This also gives you a chance to test out rough shipping times across the world, as well as prove that you can be trusted/have a good product/and to achieve some loyal buyers very quickly.<br /><br />What product are you selling, what country are you in and what countries will you be posting to?<br /><br />

				I wish you luck antigrid... I mean that.<br /><br />Vending at SR is not easy... regardless of what some may think.<br /><br />I can spend upwards of 4 hours a day just packaging... it is a VERY time intensive and you are always under the gun to get product out. I think this is what kills many vendors in the beginning. They think it will be easy but it isn&#039;t so they end up quitting. <br /><br />As for the money... it has been said before but I will say it again... &quot;if the $150 is too much, then your not ready to vend&quot;<br /><br />I spend as much as $500 a week on packaging supplies and postage... that is $500 out of my pocket that I have to front before I ever see any money from The Road...<br /><br />Never mind the gas driving all over doing drops to keep from being repetitive...<br /><br />and what about product? what happens when you sell everything but you have to wait a week or two to get more money from the road to get more product?<br /><br />my advice is save up $2 to $3k then get started... it will make it a lot easier on you.<br /><br />Good Luck!!!<br />TJ

I thought with Bitcoin (initial funding) there wasn&#039;t a lot of hoops to jump through to remain anonymous because the bitcoin wallet in itself is anonymous and untraceable. Is there something I am misunderstanding about that?<br /><br />As for finalizing, I am confused on this because don&#039;t most vendors require you to finalize before they send? Yet in the buyers guide on these forums it says to NEVER finalize before receiving product. I won&#039;t be buying until I sell some so I guess I will worry about that when the time comes.<br /><br />Initially I am going to be selling 30mg IR Adderall (Generic). I will see how that goes and possibly expand to other things that I am able to get if they are going to be profitable, but that is all for the time being. I will only be shipping domestically within the USA.

				I sure do appreciate this thread. Like a sponge, I have soaked up the priceless information that has been given out here and it is priceless. The $150 fee is nothing and a million times worth it considering the cost of opening a franchise business. So $3000 grand is a pretty good amount to start with? Sounds awesome. Thank you all for the schooling.

				You also need a vac sealer, a decent foodsaver alone runs about $150-$180. Spend the money on the sealer, air holes and leaks might cause huge problems.

				There&#039;s a guy on the forums by the name of &quot;FarmerBob&quot; who had posted a few times about vacuum sealers, and why they may not be the best option.&nbsp; Apparently, the vacuum itself does very little, and smell-proofing is more about the type and quality of the material used, and the width of the seal.&nbsp; His posts make a lot of sense to me, and I will be following his advice, despite having already purchased a vacuum sealer.<br /><br />I&#039;m not knocking the triple-vac method, as it obviously works well enough, but if there&#039;s a better option that is still fairly cost-effective, it&#039;s worth considering.&nbsp; I may even use a vac-sealed layer or two on top of the MBB method.
