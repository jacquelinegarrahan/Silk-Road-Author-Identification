				Can anyone recommended a decent set of digital scales?<br /><br />I got a small one off eBay which is ok, but if I put on anything that weighs less than 1g, it doesn&#039;t register. <br /><br />I like to measure out my mdma into gel caps, but atm it&#039;s kinda all guess work. lol <br /><br />Any suggestions ie. brands, online shops etc...?

				I got one off of Amazon just a few days ago. It was an &#039;American Weigh Signature Series Digital Pocket Scale&#039; and was just $10 after shipping. It weighs increments of .01 g and i tested it right out of the box with a nickle (which should weigh 5g) and it came up to 4.99 g. Considering the price and accuracy I can&#039;t help but recommend it.<br />

				If you live near a big flea market there might be a head shop or two at the flea - no shit - I&#039;ve seen it with my own eyes!&nbsp; I suppose alot depends on which state but I counted 1/2 dozen head shops at a flea market in a state where pot &amp; paraphernalia are illegal.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; They had some nice Blade brand scales for less than $20 as I recall... good luck with your search!<br /><br />Weight of nickels from above:&nbsp; I actually looked this up a few years ago ... weight of all U.S. coins varies due to dirt, debris, damage and plain ol&#039; wear &amp; tear.&nbsp; Old nickels with lots of silver obviously weigh more than today&#039;s nickels, silver nickels stopped sometime in the 1940&#039;s, I&#039;m too lazy to look it up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today, a clean nickel in good shape should weigh between 4.9 grams and 5.1 grams so there may not be anything wrong with the scale&nbsp; ::)
