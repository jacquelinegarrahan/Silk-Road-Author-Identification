				Hello, I first heard about Silk Road from a Channel 4 news reportage:<br /><br />http://www.channel4.com/news/dark-web-the-internet-behind-our-own<br /><br />In this reportage they say that Silk Road is a platform to sell child pornography. I had to confirm this for myself, but to my surprise it seems like you don&#039;t have any CP listed at all.<br /><br />Now, is it that all the CP has sold out or are they straight out lying in their reportage in order to slander BitCoin and the Silk Road?<br /><br />Or have you changed your policy since they made the reportage 1st of September 2011?<br />Or is the CP just hidden and must be enabled somehow?

				there is no, has never been, and will never be child porn on SR. We represent free market for VICTIMLESS CRIMES. some include owning weapons in that category, but no one thinks child porn is victimless.<br /><br />They do this type of slander because they know we, as otherwise law abiding, but still considered criminal, citizens will not pursue a slander lawsuit. Why don&#039;t you write a letter to your other local stations to see which one picks up the story on the false reporting by Channel 4? Though I fear they&#039;d just jump on the fear bandwagon.

				A reply already? Cool, I was expecting to wait at least a few days until someone answered.<br /><br />However, as they say in the news clip they have seen CP up for sale on Silk Road (otherwise they are making up the news - which is what I want to find out if they did).<br /><br />Is there a policy somewhere around here that states what exactly is allowed? It might be possible that someone posted CP even though it&#039;s not allowed while the reporters were investigating, but I&#039;d like to know if there&#039;s an official policy strictly against it.<br /><br />I have heard that there&#039;s a policy forbidding stuff that harms other people on the Silky Road (stuff like nukes and contracts to kill others) however that seems to be false since guns are up for sale on Silky Road. I&#039;m not sure if it was in the news reportage that I linked to that they claimed that harmful stuff were forbidden on Silk Road (too lazy to check), but I&#039;m not sure where else I could have read it. In any way it turned out to be false since guns are allowed.

				No, CP is not on the Silk Road. The article is poorly written, it doesn&#039;t really say Silk Road sells CP, just that there are sites on the darknet that do. There are sites on the darknet where you can find CP but SR is not associated with them, most of us are quite opposed to it.

				My angle is that I&#039;m just curios, really. I like technology, I like to be on the edge of it. Bitcoin is new and there&#039;s no way of telling how it will end up. I especially look forward to next year when a generated block will award 25 BTC instead of 50 BTC. I predict this will make the value of a Bitcoin rise since there will be much less Bitcoins added into circulation each day, which will give the currency more heat from the government in USA for example. Maybe. I dunno, time will tell.<br /><br />Also, I like to know things. I&#039;m extremely open minded, had I found CP here - &quot;so be it&quot; I would have thought. But now I just found drugs and guns. Very interesting. I bet there&#039;s a Tor site for CP selling using Bitcoins somewhere out there in the dark though, maybe some day I will stumble upon it. Who knows? Or maybe Bitcoin simply isn&#039;t Anonymous enough for that purpose since you can trace every transaction.<br /><br />And yeah, I know guns can be used for defense in the USA but why buy a very expensive gun on a dark net if it&#039;s going to be used for defense? Surely it must be cheaper and easier to do it legally? But, yes you are right. Guns can be used both for attack and defense while bombs and hit-contracts are only offensive. echo_ highlights a solid point, I think that without nukes the world would have seen a lot more wars than it has in the last hundred years. It helps to keep the USA from invading countries that has nukes since it means that there&#039;s a high risk that their civilian structure would actually suffer great damage. And countries won&#039;t use nukes without being threatened first because they know it affects the global state of nature or because the attacked land would be useless and there&#039;s nothing to be gained from the attack (no resources to harvest. Plus the rest of the world would get pissed off at them). Thus peace is preserved thanks to nuclear weapon, pretty ironic.<br /><br />@zirkelwin: You may be right there, they don&#039;t actually single out Silk Road and clearly states that this site contains CP, I just interpreted it as such since they were showing Silk Road while talking about sites on the Tor network in general. Sorry about that people.<br /><br />Just for fun I can say how I found out about Silk Road.<br /><br />First I went to http://bitcoincharts.com/ to check out some charts on how much Bitcoin was worth.<br /><br />On their front page I noticed a link to http://bitcoinmedia.com/proof-of-work-exposed entitled &quot;The &#039;Work&#039; That Bitcoin Mining Performs&quot; that I thought sounded interesting. It explains a bit more of the mathematical algorithm.<br /><br />After reading it I wanted to see what other stuff Bitcoin Media had. Found http://bitcoinmedia.com/thank-you-schumer/<br /><br />On that page he said that he was interviewed but they cut him off completely since he gave too good answers. That&#039;s where he posted the video shown in http://www.channel4.com/news/dark-web-the-internet-behind-our-own where they mentioned Silk Road.<br /><br />I did a Google search for &quot;silk road bitcoin&quot;, found (yep) http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable<br /><br />In the article was a link to http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php and I already knew what Tor is and I had it installed.<br /><br />On that page it said that Silk Road has moved. To silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />I clicked around finding no CP and thought I should ask in the forums, which were linked.<br /><br />And that&#039;s the story of how I found my way here. The end.<br /><br />--<br /><br />&quot;Warning - while you were typing 2 new replies have been posted. You may wish to review your post.&quot;<br /><br />I keep getting this warning because I keep answering people and more post while I rewrite my post. I&#039;ll just ignore the last two posts and post my reply now. x)

				@doctor:<br /><br />&gt;herewas that mysterious millionaire transaction afew months back in the BtC system<br />Did he convert a lot of Bitcoins to USD or another currency? Might have been the creator of Bitcoin that finally cashed in. Although since he is so strict about being Anonymous it would be strange if he did a lot at once since it&#039;s easier to trace.<br /><br />&gt;fancies himself a detectie<br />Please don&#039;t call me a detective. I&#039;m a cyber investigator.<br /><br />@N2DEEP:<br /><br />&gt;lease do not list anything who&#039;s purpose is to harm<br />Guns aren&#039;t meant to harm? I know it&#039;s not my place to speak up but maybe the restricted item rule should be rewritten a little so that it doesn&#039;t contradict with what&#039;s actually allowed. &quot;Harm&quot; here must be meant as &quot;psychical&quot; harm (like harming someone with bad language), not &quot;physical&quot; (as in shooting someone in the head).<br /><br />;-)

				we already reviewed the definition of &quot;meant to cause harm&quot;. You can&#039;t go to a bomb range and bomb practice targets. You can&#039;t hunt with cyanide. You can&#039;t collect hit contracts. But you can do all that with guns. <br /><br />I referred to the USA since the little whiner(who took the tone he took most likely because he was snubbed) is from the USA, but i think most customers would be buying from overseas. <br /><br />I do not own guns nor do i have an interest in them and i think they shouldn&#039;t be on SR, there are other sites dedicated for their trade for those that wish them, but just restating the same argument as before doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re dialoguing.

				Did a global search yesterday for samples (for the sale) and it was apparently a global search because it was pulling listings from all over.&nbsp; One of the listings was cp.&nbsp; I immediately prepared to report this and while I was composing a message to the site the listing was removed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I assume that some administrator had the post deleted and I appreciated that.&nbsp; We do NOT NEED cp on this site.&nbsp;

You&#039;re telling us you&#039;re not disturbed even a little bit by CP? You must have some chemical imbalance in your nervous system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />CP is such a broad thing. I am not disturbed at all by pictures of naked 17 year olds. I am really not even disturbed at all by pictures of naked one year olds. I would be disturbed by pictures of one year olds being raped, but if someone else likes them I don&#039;t really care. If someone actually rapes a one year old they should be killed though, or at least left to die in prison. <br /><br />Also I would be about as disturbed by a picture of a one year old being raped as I would be by a picture of someone who blew their head off with a shotgun, and probably slightly less disturbed than I would be by a picture of a girl in a tub shitting on her face. I also don&#039;t care if you like such pictures, although to be fair you will kill yourself if you shoot yourself in the face with a shotgun, and you probably shouldn&#039;t be killed or sent to die in prison if you shit on your face in a bath tub.

I had to confirm this for myself, but to my surprise it seems like you don&#039;t have any CP listed at all.<br /><br />Now, is it that all the CP has sold out or are they straight out lying in their reportage in order to slander BitCoin and the Silk Road?<br /><br />Or have you changed your policy since they made the reportage 1st of September 2011?<br />Or is the CP just hidden and must be enabled somehow?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Just crack, and a few other minor drugs.
