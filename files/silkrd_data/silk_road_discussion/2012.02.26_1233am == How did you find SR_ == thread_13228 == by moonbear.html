				I was wondering how everyone here found out about SR. One day I just thought, &quot;I bet there&#039;s a website out there where I can buy drugs&quot; so I googled &quot;buy drugs online&quot;, and found a youtube video by a guy named adamfreelance. That video showed me silk road. Then I downloaded tor and now here I am.

				Its kind of off the wall. I really never expected to find a site like this. It started when I got real interested into hackers, not the guys that are out for money, but the ones out to make a joke of govt agencies and corporations (i.e. Anonymous, and LulzSec). I noticed a little icon on the LulSec site that said they took bitcoins as donations, and through Bitcoins I found Silk Road. Lol, I think that may have been the greatest moments of my life. I&#039;ve always been around drugs, but never the good ones. I took acid for the first time about 1-2 months after I found the site and my life hasn&#039;t been the same sense. That&#039;s my story, my friends that I will be working with heard of SR from me.

				Ahahaha, I found out on reddit also. It&#039;s not a website I ever use though.<br />I was about to purchase some RC&#039;s from a vendor online and was doing some research on the particular chem that I don&#039;t recall the name of. I never ended up getting it because I found SR. I was shocked that such a place could exist, but also ecstatic beyond belief.

				Read some deep web threads on 4chan. Seemed interesting so I did some research and stumbled across Silk Road. Then I lost interest and forgot about it for a while.<br />I&#039;ve always been fascinated by psychedelic drugs and their effects on the mind. Reading trip reports on Erowid, watching videos and reading articles about the wonders of psychedelics.<br />After I decided I really was ready I asked some friends to help me find shrooms. I had been hearing about some going around in their circles and they said they could most likely get me some. They never ended up coming through.<br />Finally put 2 and 2 together, made a Silk Road account, bought LSD, anxiously waited for a week. Once I received it I dropped a tab and it was AMAZING. Everything I had read about and more.<br />So yeah that&#039;s my life story.

				Well, as I own TorDir I found it doing a routine check on the newest links when it was still hosted in a Tor VHost and working with MyBitcoin (luckily SR jumped of before MBC turned to be a scam). My primary account has an ID of earliest 200. Never though to be on the &quot;competition&quot; by now&nbsp; ;D<br />Nevertheless, at TorDir it gave me quite a job to brand all those phishing sites sometime ago, before double lock passwords were enforced.<br />For some wondering why I prefer to brand those with *PHISHING* instead of delete it; it&#039;s because TorDir is wide-open in nature but doesn&#039;t allow duplicate links. Therefore rather leave the link there and tag it than delete which would allow the scammer to post it again... not that matters anymore, an user would need to be well out of his mind to give his 2 passwords and 1 alone just if he want to go send PM&#039;s on your behalf.<br /><br />cheers.

				Actually, I stumbled across bitcoins and liked the idea of making money with them somehow, (having a number of ways to procure them with techno-savvyness) then, while poking around tor in fascination, found a much better use for them =D

				I honestly don&#039;t even remember. I think a buddy of mine mentioned it to me last year, and I never really thought about it until I started researching and getting interested in TOR. One thing led to another, and I happened to stumble upon SR again. Was a little leary at first, but I came back a few months later, being now, and took the plunge. I have my 1st successful transaction coming this week, so you can say I&#039;m excited.&nbsp; :)
