				I am really truly appreciating the maintenance page with the link to this thread.&nbsp; So much better than a generic maintenance message and tons of paranoid conjecture here in the forums about what could possibly be wrong with the site, and how DPR isn&#039;t doing his/her job well enough (fucking bullshit!), etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m so sorry this issue happened--I spent 36 of the last 48 hours dealing with critical website issues at my day job IRL, one after the other in a never-ending clusterfuck of mismanagement and poor development, so I completely understand what DPR is going through tonight, with the urgency to get SR back online to satisfy the thousands of users who are patiently waiting to get on with their business here.<br /><br />As always, and I think I speak for most everyone here (except for Virwex maybe), we are grateful for the time and work that you put into running and maintaining this website, not to mention the risk that must be involved.&nbsp; The world is almost certainly a better place thanks to your vision, and the effort you put into turning that vision into a reality for all of us to utilize and enjoy.<br /><br />Thanks!

				DPR was advising vendors not to ship orders because some of the orders received tonight were funded with non-existent coins and the vendors would then have been scammed.&nbsp; So he said that to PROTECT vendors ... and it only applies until the issue is resolved (which it sounds like it has been now).

				I whipped up some cookie lastnight actually, I only use very pure coke an nomore than a gram at a time. I use a small metal candle holder, candle, lil baking soda,butter knife, lil water an coke ofcourse. 1st mix 3 parts 3/4ths of a g in 1st, sprinkle 1:4th soda on top evenly, then add a few drops of water till its mushy, heat it up about 20 seconds it&#039;ll fizz an bubble all while mixing it with a penny or butter knife check if any waters left ill let it fizz on the candle a lil longer, take it away from the heat as you&#039;ll see it start to clump up+become more solid, now that all the waters cooked off I put it in the freezer for 10 mins at most and bam I always get the alot using this method for those who don&#039;t wanna smoke all ur coke.

I&#039;m happy to see DPR shut SilkRoad down (always safety and security first) and has provided us with an official update quickly - Thank-you DPR! Some friendly advice to anyone who is experiencing SilkRoad going down for maintenance for the first time,&nbsp; please don&#039;t panic, forge unfounded conspiracy theories, or troll, it&#039;s not the first time SilkRoad has gone down (and I&#039;m sorry to say it, realistically we&#039;re not living in a perfect world it probably won&#039;t be the last time either). We&#039;re all in this boat together, let&#039;s keep calm, carry on, and show DPR and the admin team our support. DPR I wish you and the admin team find a secure, safe, and sound solution for this glitch. God speed DPR :)

These &quot;glitch&quot; or &quot;setback&quot; times, and I mentioned this back during the great SR Blackout of early Novemer 2012. Are like large storms, that cause neighbors who haven&#039;t spoken in months, sometimes years, to come out of their houses since they finally have something in common to talk about. <br /><br />I grew up on the South Shore of Long Island, and we had the occasional Hurricane make landfall over the years. (I especially remember Hurricane Belle &#039;76). I witnessed the Eye pass over where I was (Shelter Island) at the time. Suddenly it got quiet and calm, and the full moon shone down, and you could see gulls flying way up in the center of the eye. The stars were shining. It was beautiful. Then as fast as that began, wind gusts started coming from the opposite direction from the ones that had just stopped! That was the other side of the storm, and we all had to run back inside. <br /><br />The next day,after a hurricane,&nbsp; it&#039;s almost always sunny and dry, with the sound of chainsaws everywhere. Neighbors with a ladder helping ones without, while that neighbors son is helping the old lady across the street with a chainsaw, cutting down a tree that fell against her home.. <br /><br />I got the feeling it was all part of God&#039;s plan. Not a Holy Roller here, I just believe, as Einstein did, that there has to be a greater intelligent force out there, and sometimes throws our toys around so we have to all come out of our caves and interact with each other for a change. <br /><br />So it&#039;s nice to meet you neighbors! As well as see some of you I&#039;ve talked too throughout the years. <br /><br />- Peace <br /><br />jagfug.<br /><br />PS Just an idea for DPR - any complainers, that aren&#039;t just scared, but are just genuinely self centered, and blatantly critical in the face of the site owner they&#039;ve been benefiting from all this time, should be the LAST account to come back up. Not for revenge, buy maybe just to teach the old age lesson &quot;Don&#039;t bite the hand that feeds&quot;

				I know a guy who knows a guy who knows charlie sheens dog told me wats going on. <br />The lastest meteor that hit russia this morning was actually a new secret weapon the usa deployed against dpr&#039;s headquarters. Little is known but luckily he was able to assimilate into the binary code of the terminal he was using to escape. Since sr was his open page at the time this extra code in the system took the form of bitcoins in the network appearing randomly in peoples wallets. <br />After reassembling in the next few hours once enough btc network confirmations can be made (which takes a while with a whole person ofc) he plans to reopen and deploy an offensive on the corrupt governments of the world by facilitating the sale of more drugs to more people than the world has ever seen before! <br />However there are fears since they form the transcended dpr if anyone was able to spend of these btc and they cant be recovered he may suffer symptoms of a stroke victim. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				100% back up. I was one of the users whos funds were affected. Can confirm everything is in order and exactly the way it should be. As much as I loved having $16,000 randomly come into my account, I&#039;m glad to hear its back up and my REAL coins are properly in my wallet.<br />Although it appears to be very very few of us, I CANNOT believe I see people bitching. I personally think the SR staff and DPR were on top of this matter instantly. I was one of the first users to report the bug and I saw step by step how the staff responded. This was fixed in ~12 hours. Amazing developers we have here. I would only wish I had the smarts that DPR and this staff has to keep such an amazing website running while having governments try to shut it down. <br /><br />*clap clap clap* I salute all of you! Including this whole community.<br /><br />Peace and love. Long live SR and DPR! Keep up the good work my brothers and sisters.<br /><br />And Sonic wtf? No one wants to know you&#039;ll kill yourself. Chill out. LOOK! Everything is back up and running fine! Why should you be so down? Goddamn. Be thankful for what you got. Nobodys hating on you. The only hate you&#039;ll get is what hate you bring to the table.

				Well done. Normally I should start worrying with these kinds of bugs, but each day I pass on SilkRoad, the more impressed I get with the support team. DPR personally sent me a message with all orders that were glitched so I could cancel them. Never would I have noticed there was a bug if it wasn&#039;t from that message.

				So, what&#039;s going on with the withdrawals?<br /><br />I withdrew $500 from my buyer account on here to this account so I could start up being a seller, over 15 hours later and nothing...and nothing is on blockchain either.<br /><br />Guess I should just wait and it&#039;ll sort itself out? I&#039;m a little worried all that BTC just went poof into thin-air...that would suck.
