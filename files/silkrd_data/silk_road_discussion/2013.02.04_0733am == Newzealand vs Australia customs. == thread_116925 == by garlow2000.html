				So between Aussie and NZ who would have the better customs for intercepting drugs?<br />I know NZ has very good detection for possible pests and bio-hazards but I am unsure how much luck they have with silkroad interception?<br /><br />Im fairly confidant they would catch most bulk eg 10+ grams but I also think many small package&#039;s an letters would easily get through.<br /><br />Regards Garlow2000<br />

				I suspect the Australian border control has some kind of particalsniffer.<br />The same that reveals if a banknote (money-bill) is touched by someone who didn;t wash his hands before touching the money-bill.<br /><br />To many sellers touch the envelope after touching drugs like cocaine.<br />Cross contamination will point out the suspected envelope.<br />

Both countries have tight customs, inviting people to speculate on what they think to be true on this subject is a waste of time.<br /><br />Sorry if that sounds a bit harsh, but it needed to be said.
