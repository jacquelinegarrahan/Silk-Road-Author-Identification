				Now the first thing i should say is im pretty new to this site etc so i might have got it wrong but i dont think so&nbsp; ???<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve just logged on to leave some feedback for a couple of orders that arrived this morning (both 5 outa 5&#039;s so not all bad) and after clicking finalised looked at my account and it&#039;s saying 0.00 ?<br />&nbsp;HOW-WHO-WHY-WHAT?? It was only 1.1 BC&#039;s,not a vast ammount but it&#039;s just what i needed to put towards my next order and now it&#039;s not there.Im right in thinking that your BC&#039;s get withdrawn as soon as you make your order and NOT when you hit finalise aren&#039;t i? I don&#039;t recall looking to see if they were there just before i hit finalise on two orders just now so don&#039;t know if they&#039;ve been withdrawn before or after.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve looked on my accounts and all the correct deposits and orders are there with BC&#039;s taken out for orders etc then the final transaction was at 7.52am UTC this morning i think but i wasn&#039;t even online let alone ordered anything,there&#039;s an address for where it&#039;s gone?? What do i do now,can i get them back? Or i have i made a mistake and it&#039;s a correct withdrwal? Like i said im new to all this :-\ If there gone for good should i change my password etc? Anymore security advice from the tech savy would be good,shit i&#039;ve lost them haven&#039;t i?<br />&nbsp;Just glad i didn&#039;t have all my BC&#039;s lying around,pretty pissed off man.<br />Any help greatfully apreciated thanks-I should add i have a slightly different username on SR,il post it if anyone needs to check

				When you place an order it goes like this:<br />1. add item to cart<br />2. checkout<br />3. your funds get transferred to escrow (deducting that amount from your account instantly)<br />4. funds stay in escrow until you hit finalize<br />5. hit finalize, funds are send to seller from escrow<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of hard to get at what you&#039;re saying. Maybe cool off for a sec then repost without all the rambling.<br />Hope that helped.

				there have been several reports of a bitcoin/tumbler glitch this morning. This has happened before though it is rare. Silk usually has it fixed pretty quickly. As of this writing people are posting that it is working again. You can submit issues like this by clicking the &quot;contact us&quot; link at the bottom right of each page.

				Change your password anyway.&nbsp; Use a non-dictionary word or even a full sentence (with spaces) and throw in a few special characters to boot.<br /><br />If you use that password/user combo anywhere else that place could have gotten hacked and someone could have easily just tried that user/pass combo here to see if it worked.....

				I had the same issue today. It was just a few 0.x coins but it wasnt me they were sent to.<br /><br />withdrawal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1B4MMde4yVSrBiS9TPThEGErjb5Eb28xiK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿-0.38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿0.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 19, 2011, 8:25 am UTC<br /><br />I think its a new phishing side or something I came from the HW link to SR and had problems with the captcha.<br /><br />Reported and changed my PW.

				Ok,i didn&#039;t realise i was rambling lol,i had only just found out though.<br />&nbsp;Right then basically i had only 1.1 bitcoin left,had logged in to leave feedback and noticed the my account was at zero,now this was after i&#039;d hit finalize but TBH it could of been empty before then i didn&#039;t check.All my transactions check out,my deposits and transactions via escrow,except one this morning at 7.58 am with the bitcoin address 19pVCs1zB8CZYUfY7uDqLbgk5JVmoT6ww2&nbsp; <br />So that&#039;s not silk road is it? Thinking i have definitely been had&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;During logging in last night i did have trouble and i think i did use the hidden wiki link in the end,since my last post i&#039;ve read that&#039;s a big no no,so you live you learn,just glad i didn&#039;t have a full account and had ordered first though.<br />I have changed my password but am still a little bit reluctant to deposit anymore BC&#039;s just yet for an order,think i&#039;ll leave it a couple of days till my security is sorted.<br />&nbsp;Im still learning to use PGP,busy this week but it&#039;s a priority now so that&#039;s why i haven&#039;t contacted SR,you have to include your PGP key don&#039;t you?<br />&nbsp;Cheers

				Yeah that sucks about the hidden wiki spam. I guess they can&#039;t fix that?<br />And yes, add your PGP key BEFORE you encrypt your message. <br />
