				AFAIK there is escrow. ALOT of SR refugees are complaining about &#039;no escrow&#039;, yet all the vendors say there is. Also, it seems like the website/server at sheep is handling the extra load rather better than BMR (though, apparently the vendors are having a bit of trouble adjusting to the influx of orders). <br /><br />That said, I have now managed to make a BMR account. I intend to do what I did at the start on SR; hang around a bit and get an idea of what&#039;s going on before jumping in and ordering small amounts, building a bit of trust. Square one....
