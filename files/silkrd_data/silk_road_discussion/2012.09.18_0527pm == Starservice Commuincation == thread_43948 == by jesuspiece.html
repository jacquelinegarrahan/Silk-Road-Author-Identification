				I was wondering if anyone has tried to reach him at his tormail email, instead of using the SR messaging system. I sent him a couple messages about what we will do if my package ends up getting lost, or not delierved, and if he can see where my package is with the DCN that he said he was going to use when purchases we&#039;re over 100$. <br /><br />I was just curious if anyone got a quicker response from him through email rather then the SR messaging system. <br /><br />I&#039;m crossing my fingers my package gets here without problems, because I already ended up FE, which I probably didn&#039;t even need to do to begin with, because I don&#039;t think he would&#039;ve cancelled it if I didn&#039;t FE. Really bad choice on my part, but lets pray xD

				I have had 3 orders with him in the past 2 months, his communication has been somewhat poor but he might be getting swamped. I love his candies but they aren&#039;t up right now and he&#039;s playing wild card so I will avoid for a little bit, great candies though

				His communication is shit.<br />I placed an order A WEEK ago.. after 3 days he asked my address again because apparently his PC died, so i sent it to him... after that he never changed the status to &quot;in transit&quot;... i asked him WTF was going on, on 2 different PMs... today he canceled my order and didnt response to any of my messages.<br />its a shame.
