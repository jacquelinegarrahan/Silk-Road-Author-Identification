				Hello,<br /><br />I just got some coins but the vendor sold out of their product before i could get to it. So i hought id try something else and need user feedback on personal experience.<br /><br />I am an opiate lover. Shoot dillies, Oxys, Morphine, Heroin, and whatever else can be IVd. I also like the feeling of xanax, have always wanted to shoot it but dont have the chemicals to extract it into an IVable form. Also hear there is no real benefit anyway. i used to take adderals and liked them but im not so much of a fan of uppers. tried coke a few times, never really liked it.<br /><br />Well thats my &quot;taste&quot; on what i enjoy and i would rather IM/IV because i enjoy the rush. Anyone have any recommendations as to what drug i should give a try? ive been lookin at Ketamine but I dont know anyone who was done it to really base an opinion. but it seems like a drug ton chill and mellow out on.... also im not lookin to take drug at a party or anything but in the comfort ofn myn own home, watch a good movie, lay back and just enjoy the euphoria!<br /><br />Also, i d3cided to get more powdered Xanny so im down to just 7 bitcoins, so somethin in that price range. i could always add more but just for the sake of convenience and trying somethin for a firsti rather not.<br /><br />THANKS!!<br /><br />atthepeak23

				I don&#039;t do anything in an IV. I don&#039;t really like coke either. I like Xanax and codeine in pill form. I LOVE molly. Have you ever tried MDMA? Its perfect to do at home with a lover or close friend. Its euphoric feeling for sure. I don&#039;t know from personal experience but ket is a good one for home. And I&#039;ve heard DMT is cool to try once or twice.

				You can get 130 mg MDMA powder from Magic Ceelo for about .7 btc<br />I&#039;ve tried it, it&#039;s&nbsp; a good roll!<br />You could do a key bump for a little rush.

				I once bough 20 bags of some really really strong K. I can tell you banging K is incredible. However if you have things to do, you better not even start it. Most likely you will keep redosing. One shot = 30 Minutes of a k-hole dream world. It wears off as fast as it hit you too. One minute you&#039;re Stuck, next minute its gone. It works great IM also for longer lasting effects.

				Based on what you already like I think you will enjoy GHB very much - read more here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.0<br /><br />Ketamine is very special, but a very deep experience (IM 100mg - 300mg). Not to be used casually IMHO...

I&#039;m just a couple days into the first gram I&#039;ve bought off sr (+ only had done one bump prior to this ~2 years ago) from marcelketman, so it&#039;s still very new to me. And I&#039;ve decided to wait to the weekend to attempt my first k hole, so I&#039;ve only experimented up to ~ 70 mg. Now, my experience might be colored (possibly heavily influenced), by the fact that I&#039;d read a few &quot;ket = depression treatment [?]&quot; threads prior to purchasing. But what I&#039;ve found is that ket has brought me more in touch with my emotions (ie some personal shit I&#039;ve been putting off dealing with, and how putting it off has made me feel). It&#039;s certainly not unpleasant, actually I find that the dissociative effect of ket, while very different from the euphoric relaxation of barbs or ops, is relaxing in it&#039;s own, unique way. My metaphor is that it&#039;s like the relaxation you feel when you return home, versus the relaxation of blissing out.<br /><br />I&#039;d be curious if anyone else identifies at all with this description.

				Ketamine is a good suggestion but I&#039;ve never tried it so I can&#039;t give you my opinion on it. I&#039;ve tried MXE though, which is said to be very similar to K and it&#039;s more potent, cheaper and possibly still legal where you live. I recommend it :)
