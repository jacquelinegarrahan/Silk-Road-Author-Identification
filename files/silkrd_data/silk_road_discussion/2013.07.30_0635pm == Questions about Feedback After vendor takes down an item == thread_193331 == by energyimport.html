				Hey guys, <br /><br />I wanted to know if you currently have a item &quot;supposedly&quot; in transit but during that time the vendor Takes down the listing....Or I guess put the listing in Stealth Mode (Since I can still click and see the listing but none of the feedback&#039;s from other buyers show up at the bottom they all disappeared)<br /><br />If this is some sort of scam and I leave a negative rating etc etc it would it show on the vendors main page with all the other feedbacks for other listings?<br /><br />Sorry if that is confusing, Just curious. <br /><br /><br />Thanks

				It&#039;s more than likely that you took the last of what they had!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If they are a reliable and reputable seller you shouldn&#039;t need to worry dude.<br /><br />

Your feedback score still goes towards their overall vendor rating, so I guess it shouldn&#039;t matter to much.

				As said already, if the quantity available goes to 0, then the listing automatically goes into a stealth-like mode. It&#039;s not the same as stealth mode. When an item goes to 0 quantity and is no longer listed, your feedback will still be visible. If you bookmarked the item, when you browse to that bookmark, it will come up as:<br /><br />This item is not currently listed<br /><br />

				Well when I go to the listing through my orders page and click on the item and add it to my cart it still shows they have a bunch available.<br /><br /><br />Thats kind of why I think it is strange. But I guess only time will tell. <br />
