				...is a good dilemma to have. <br /><br />My friend and I have been talking about which deal to go for, but have arrived at a stalemate, so I bring the question to you:<br /><br />With JOR, I can get 10 hits of ~110ug for about $120 after shipping.<br />With Haizenberg, I can get 10 hits of ~100ug for about $83 with free shipping. <br /><br />I am currently restricted to these two because I am new to purchasing on the Road and my spendings/transactions aren&#039;t yet beefy enough for other vendors. Both seem to have great reviews for quality and trustworthiness, so I am not worried about that, I&#039;m sure they&#039;re great vendors. With Haizenberg I get more ug/$, but with JOR I likely get the shipment faster. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: Weeeeeelllllll I just learned that with Haizenberg I can get 15 hits for about $120 as well, so that&#039;s likely what I&#039;ll be doing. Great thread, cheers all around! You can all either pad my ego or scold me for my choice now. <br /><br /><br />

				A lot of people including myself consider JOR to be basically the best and friendliest vendor on all of SR. You couldn&#039;t go with anyone more established really. That said, Haizenberg has nothing but excellent reviews from what I&#039;ve seen, and the price is even better. I guess it&#039;s just a case of how quickly you want that acid.

				You&#039;re right, and I suppose I&#039;m in no big hurry if I don&#039;t want to be in a big hurry. Thanks for the reply, oldcactushand, and while I will not get caught up in the karma game like a certain younger self has on forums long ago, you are granted my very first &#039;+&#039;.

				NewStem.....I would HIGHLY recommend you pick up a quarter vial of JoR liquid LSD ToC.....it&#039;s 20 drops for $163.50.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hell if you can come up with the cash I would really recommend picking up a full vial.&nbsp; &nbsp;Trust me it will make your SUMMER and maybe even the rest of your year depending on your usage and number of friends you have.&nbsp; &nbsp;This liquid is the BEST ACID I have EVER tried.&nbsp; &nbsp;Serious.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read the reviews on his page from some experienced psychonauts and newbies too.&nbsp; &nbsp;AMAZING STUFF....I guarantee it will be one of your best purchases on SR EVER.&nbsp; I don&#039;t say that lightly either.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Damn, that sounds totally ideal, but he no longer has the quarter vial listing nor does he have liquid in stock right now, it appears. From his page: &quot;For future listings we&#039;ll just be listing Full, Half and Quarter vials&quot;; maybe I should PM him about it. If I could afford a full vial I&#039;d be dosing people left and right.

				I can vouch for the TOC liquid and apologise for not mentioning it! Beautiful stuff. I&#039;m not very experienced with acid, so &quot;the best acid I&#039;ve ever done&quot; is meaningless coming from me. But there&#039;s a lot of very experienced trippers here saying exactly that. I currently have plans to go to a secluded mountainous area in the next month or 2 with this stuff for a few days. I am literally giddy just thinking about it.

				I&#039;m taking the plunge and going for the half vial, if silkroad ever loads. I got the coinage just now, hopefully my low buy stats don&#039;t matter and i am swimming in &#039;cid before i know it.
