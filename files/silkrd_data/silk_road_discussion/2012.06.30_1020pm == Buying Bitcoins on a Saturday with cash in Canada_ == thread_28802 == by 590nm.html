				I wouldn&#039;t order from bitcoinsforless, the guy has the exact profile that sythetik the scammer had. Where does he make his profit from? He has no mark up from btc prices. I don&#039;t see any BTC transaction fees. synthetik, also canadian, also the only one to use email money transfer, also didn&#039;t ask for a mark up and he also didn&#039;t sell products so he&#039;s not just trying to turn his btc into cash. And he&#039;s also spamming ads just like sythetik did. He&#039;s the same fucking guy. I would be careful when dealing with him, he&#039;s gonna build up his rep again then start ripping people off making up excuses so no one alerts the forums that he is not paying up.

				I use cavirtex.com, they have limits for unverified accounts (an account where you have only given out an email address).&nbsp; You can deposit up to $1000 at any RBC branch into their account, after posting a deposit notice on their site under your account.&nbsp; You then will probably have to email them a scan of the receipt to speed up the crediting of your account.<br /><br />If you get yourself verified, remember, buying and selling BTC is not illegal, so as long as you don&#039;t do something silly like transferring the BTC you buy directly to SR from virtex, you can deposit more and have less limitations.<br /><br />I have deposited on Saturday and Sunday several times and have then been able to buy from SR within 2-6 hours of the deposit.

The RBC branch I went to asked me for ID. I said I forgot it in the car and didn&#039;t come back. I can tell you the three BMO branches I&#039;ve been to just took the cash and account number, I emailed the receipt to cavitrex, and the funds were in my account within a couple of hours.

				They must have just added the BMO.&nbsp; They used to have CIBC and RBC, and I used to go to the CIBC where they didn&#039;t ask for ID, then they stopped using them and I had to go to the RBC.&nbsp; I checked their list of bank accounts about a month ago and BMO wasn&#039;t there.<br /><br />The problem isn&#039;t the fact that RBC asks for ID and BMO doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; The problem is they now cap the amount an unverified account can deposit over 90 days to $1000.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about you, but I went through that amount in just two orders.<br /><br />I suppose you could simply setup a new account using a new email address each time, but that seems like too much trouble to me, and what will you do if/when BMO starts asking for ID (It is quite possible they are required to as per the banking laws in canada).<br /><br />Buying and selling BTC is not illegal.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people use BTC for perfectly legitimate reasons.&nbsp; So long as you launder your BTC before you deposit them to SR they have no way to trace them.&nbsp; I keep two wallets going.&nbsp; I transfer from Virtex to the first wallet then to the second wallet from the first, the second wallet is on a secure VM that I only activate when I transfer the BTC and it is on TOR, so it cannot be traced using an IP address.<br /><br />They aren&#039;t going to bust you for using BTC.&nbsp; Unless you are a vendor who doesn&#039;t wish to declare the money you should have no reason to worry about being identified as a user of BTC.<br /><br />If they bust you it is unlikely to be for BTC, they are more likely to bust you in a controlled delivery than anything else.&nbsp; To bust you for using BTC they would have to prove that you use them to purchase something illegal and in fact catch you with the substance on you.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t seem them going to all that trouble to bust some person for what are basically personal amounts of drugs.&nbsp; Unless you hand yourself to them on a platter, they are more likely going to look for the guys selling, not buying for personal use.<br />

				They just added the BMO thing. Knowing government regulations, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll be asking for ID soon. I&#039;m not really worried so much. But what&#039;s the alternative? I&#039;m still pretty new at this, but so far cavitrex -&gt; tumble -&gt; SR has worked pretty well. I&#039;m not so sure about BTC vendors?

				I have been using CaVirtex for several months, and every transaction has been perfect. Their buying price is also usually lower than other vendors.
