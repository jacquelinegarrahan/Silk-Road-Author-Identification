				i have had a lot of trouble connecting this past week. either i can&#039;t connect or it is very slow, even after the usual fixes. i do not understand what the problem is. i deal with web servers and it isn&#039;t that hard to fix these kinds of issues. upgrade the server, add varnish, scale out to more servers, etc.

				I cannot get on either. One time I actuallygot the login page served, but for some reason, the login button wouldn&#039;t work. The same thing then happened to me here too. When I click a submit button, nothing happens - the page won&#039;t post/submit. <br /><br />I am running Orbot/TOR and Firefox on an Android Honeycomb Galaxy Tablet.
