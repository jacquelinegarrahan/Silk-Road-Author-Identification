				So i got a $500 order, and i received $453.94, and im looking at the fees (which were VERY hard to find BTW), and i found them on the &quot;State of the Road Address&quot; by accident, so according to the fees, it breaks down like this:<br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />So $500:<br />10% of the first $50 ----- $5<br />8.5% of $50 - 150 ---- $12.75<br />6% of $150 - 300 ---- $18<br />3% of $300 - 500 ----&nbsp; $15<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />Which comes out to $50.75, $500 - $50.75 = $449.25. How do i calculate the fees correctly?

				The only thing i can think of is the hedging.. that costs us vendors about 4-5 percent.... I wish that SR would give a break down of every fee when we sell something or something is purchased.. it would make a lot of sense...

				The fee&#039;s are actually higher. When I sell a product for $999.99, I receive only $923.30.

				Also, I think it would be a good idea for SR to include something about the fees in their welcome message to new members. That way when buyers see the higher than street value prices they will understand that SR takes a pretty good cut.
