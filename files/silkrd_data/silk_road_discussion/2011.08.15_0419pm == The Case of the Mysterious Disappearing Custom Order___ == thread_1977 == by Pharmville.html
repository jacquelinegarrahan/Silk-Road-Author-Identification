				We are new sellers and prone to believing that we can make a mistake.&nbsp; However, this morning a situation happened where&nbsp; a customer pm&#039;d me saying that overnight his custom order had been cancelled.&nbsp; I thought I had somehow canceled it by mistake, even though it had already been shipped last Saturday.<br /><br />Upon review, I found that the order was still showing as a listing, with the available quantity being &quot;1&quot;.&nbsp; Therefore I have no idea why SR sent the buyer a notice that the order was canceled or why the buyer couldn&#039;t &quot;see&quot; the order, since it was still an active listing with an available quantity.<br /><br />Has this happened to anyone else?&nbsp; Can anyone tell me WHY it happened so we can adjust our methodology for future custom orders so it doesn&#039;t happen again?<br /><br />Thanks in advance to all who respond.&nbsp; We&#039;re very happy to be an active part of the Silk Road sellers community. :)

				Hmm, maybe our way to make an order in opiate section does not work.<br />I suggested to Alex that he make one custom order but not to put in title buyers name. That and other info can be placed in description.<br />Also that put quantaty 1 so when buyer purchase then custom listing vanish from section.<br /><br />Maybe this happen, when you have re-writen in description something triger cancelation in buyers basket. I can not be sure of this of course.<br />I do custom listing this way without any problems. Maybe you hit cancel by accident, Alex? I see custom list for nomad still active in opiate section<br />Any other idea..<br />
