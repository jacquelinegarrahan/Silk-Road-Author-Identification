				Sellers, <br /><br />Let me preface this by saying I appreciate what you guys do and know SR is only one of the many facets of your every day lives. I recently had a custom order that I filled with a pretty established seller here that requested an early escrow release due to it being only my 2nd transaction. I had no issue with this and did so and provided shipping information with correct name and address and also paid extra for priority shipping. I was provided a tracking number which I did not track until the 4th day and the package was indeed showing delivered however it was shipped to a completely different address in a completely different state so I know it definitely was not a mix up on my end. I&#039;ve yet to hear anything on how it will be handled (seller showing unactive since the 28th), however I have to ask as sellers are you just more inclined to refund the bc&#039;s, carry the balance forward until more product is available to be shipped or how exactly is it handled? <br /><br />Somewhat of a unique, yet fully understandable mistake as I know many of you are 1 person setups and have a ton of requests. Any input or thoughts would certainly be appreciated.

				Hi FunkyNuts,<br />&nbsp;Speaking from a vendors point of view, I can say that it is very possible that he simply mixed up your address with another customer.<br /><br />I imagine as you state &#039;he was an established vendor&#039;, he must have been receiving at least 5-10+ orders per day as is the norm for most serious vendors.<br /><br />I would wait until he returns from his vacation and send him a PM. Do not bombard his inbox with PM&#039;s.<br /><br />The reason I say this is I once embarked on a 7 day snowboarding trip in Patagonia. I forgot to check the box for &#039;vacation mode&#039; before I left. When I returned I had 187 orders and 244 PM&#039;s. Don&#039;t add to the vendors probably overflowing PM box.<br /><br />One PM should suffice.

				Much appreciated Reseller. I certainly went the common sense route and sent only the 1PM when the mistake is discovered. Just wanted to make sure that, as I try and build my reputation as a long term buyer that no toes were stepped on, etc. <br /><br />Patagonia is bad ass. Father used to work down there when I was a kid and got to go over a few times. Lovely indeed. <br /><br />Respect. And thanks for the prompt response.
