				What is the communities thoughts on how a vendor should deal with a buyer who FE (without any request) who then complains that he/she does not receive the package. I have just updated my profile as I&#039;ve noticed a few people FE (One person I have a custom order worked out for and I sent out a decent sample before he gets the rest of his order so he FE - this is to ensure that we are both happy with the transaction) so i though I&#039;d update it to say that if you FE without prior contact and explanation you will lose your right to a refund/reship unless pre-agreed.<br /><br />Does this seem fair? Don&#039;t want to be harsh to genuine people who have not received their packages but there is enough scamming going on here without people working outside the rules to make these decisions tougher.

It&#039;s a risk you don&#039;t have to take and just doesn&#039;t make any sense to me. Your post outlines a perfect example of why we should use the Escrow system. When a dispute is started and can&#039;t be resolved between the two parties, SR will look at any evidence provided and make a decision based on the facts. That way, the decision is by a third party and is fair to both sides. FE also doesn&#039;t look good on your feedback and personally, when I see FE down the feedback page, I loose interest fast. Buyers should NEVER FE for anyone (newbies and bad stats excluded) but by the same token, buyers need to Finalize their order immediately once it arrives.

				I remember FE a few times when i first started out as a buyer but that was with a vendor named nucleo who had absolutely amazing communication/feedback/rapport within the community, after initial skepticism,&nbsp; before he fucked off as too many people tried to scam him. Silly move in FE but it did arrive and he did not request it (just suggested in a message he sent once the package was in transit). I have since learned that it is just not required, even hated amongst a lot of vendors but this took hours of reading forums/researching vendors/watching people loose thousands in btc due to people like wecookuk.<br /><br />Anyway thanks for your response. I guess we all learn the hard way. I will deal with these that are in transit as best as I can but from now on my policy on my profile stands and anyone who tries to blackmail after ignoring the rules can provide a REALLY GOOD case as to why it happened or simply fuck off.<br /><br />Peace

				People:&nbsp; If a vendor does not ask to FE, why is the world would you?&nbsp; How many years did you buy drugs and not WISH there was some sort of system to correct issues that arise from the sale? <br /><br />When you FE, you have lost all of your rights except to give bad reviews which you brought on yourselves by FE&#039;ing.

				Ugh, it&#039;s an obvious scam method.<br /><br />They FE, so the seller can&#039;t have anyway to affect their buyer stats. <br />But because most vendors are stand up guys/gals after telling them that they got nothing(when in reality they got the stuff), the vendor will refund them half.<br /><br />This keeps going on and on, because the buyer seems to have impeccable stats to every new seller.<br /><br />Well that&#039;s just my 2 cents, some people are just dumb. :L<br /><br />~~sitamaja

If it shows delivery as confiormed, then the seller can be protected. If there is a valid problem, however, and only good, solid and honest communication will give this, then the seller can, at his option, be magnanimous. But if the buyer is a real nincompoop, and that comes on early enough if you pay attention, then there is always resolution but again, with DCN, you&#039;re in like Flynn (or goblin).<br />

				DCN is very effective on larger or more expensive packs and I would use nothing else.&nbsp; The issue is smaller counts with DCN drive the price as a % through the roof.&nbsp; <br /><br />Luv<br />PG

				As I&#039;m based in the UK DCN is not an option. You can buy pre-paid tracked packages but these are ridiculous&nbsp; (I&#039;m sure it was Â£90 for a pack of 5 - higher than the price of half my listings) and some dont even have any cellophane wrapping so again ... fingerprints) . I can either pay by card to get it tracked online (paper trail...) or show my face in the PO and get my prints all over these packages as I cant walk into the PO in the middle of summer (I know it&#039;s winter here now but still....) with gloves on.<br /><br />These could be an option for particularly large packages. If it where as easy as picking these numbers up in bulk it wouldn&#039;t be a problem (like airmail, stickers/stamps).<br /><br />I&#039;m sure people have figured ways around this but I have yet to find one for the UK. <br /><br />Also as far as my understanding goes DCN only tracks to a postcode(zip-code) so it&#039;s pretty useless if a vendor decides to send a blank letter to your neighbor. Trust is the only real way to solve this issue and for that everyone needs to play by the rules that you agree to when you sign up/buy from a vendor. The only other option would be for an option for the vendor to re-instate the escrow if they FE but I&#039;m sure someone will find a way to scam that system as well....<br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s a tricky situation.<br /><br />It&#039;s the Golden Rule do unto to others but then you have to be able to supply references for any right to be taken seriously on a reship, since no reputable vendor is going to rip someone off!<br /><br />Then again there was that whole Tony76 saga that would be never forgotten by those he burned.<br /><br />As for Aussie weed vendors, seriously guys, pick up your game because the street is out classing you and it&#039;s sad to see.<br /><br />If you sell an established buyer something alleged to be dank nugz of hydroponic goodness, only to deliver&nbsp; apoorly packaged evelope of wet shit, you owe them not only an apology but a reship of what they paid for.<br /><br />I know this isn&#039;t a regular supermarket but isn&#039;t that the point, so that we don&#039;t rip anybody off and use the first real means of free trade since the establishment of fiat currency systems?<br /><br />There has been a lot of vendor scamming lately I suspect too, taking advantage of n00bs.<br /><br />Oh well, when you buy shit from overseas that is one tenth the price, even if you get one package, then it has still paid for itself hasn&#039;t it, especially if it&#039;s a significant amount?<br /><br />Fuck the NWO and their policy of a War On Every-fucking-thing On The Planet!<br /><br />It&#039;s interesting when you come to a place like this on the internet just to reassure yourself there are still rational people out there somewhere.<br /><br />You look at politicians and religious nutters who let them rule their lives and think &quot;is everybody fucking high but me?&quot;<br /><br />From the Middle East to Velorian in Serbia and Creationist Christians, who are but a slither of a majority of insane people in an insane world, is it little wonder people have no moral compass with which to guide their actions anymore when things have gone from Hendrix and The Beatles to Justin Bieber and NMikki Minaj what feels like for those of us in middle age as almost overnight?<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to just keep track of modern culture as someone who was fortunate enough to live through the 70&#039;s 80&#039;s &amp; 90&#039;s and not want to disappear into the wilderness like that Into The Wild boy and come back when you young people have fixed our mistakes and those of the likes of Gene Hislop and Harry Anslinger, who cause mass chaos in order to justify their despicable existences. Meanwhile those of us who are really the true people that build roads, plumb toilets and in my case drive machinery, are told we&#039;re evil criminals who are bad at our job because someone else out there knows how you should live your life. <br /><br />It&#039;s almost like young people have two choices, submit to foreign persons who care not for your livelihood or health, or bring about a revolution of thought that can facilitate a shift in attitude away from threatening people to follow you around and try to force their beliefs systems onto others through the use of enslavement through an authorized use of force within the arbitrarily drawn lines on maps. This mindset, from an era long before the internet, shows us Anarchism, and therefore true democracy and capitalist freedoms, are the best way to fix our world.<br /><br />With more prosperity among the masses we can begin to reduce our impact as a species and perhaps have some chance of surviving the next thousand years, or even couple of hundred the way things are headed.<br /><br />If we don&#039;t treat each other right in a place like this, then what hope do we have of defeating these same cultural stereotypes that keep us all living in fear or as they would say in the Western media, &quot;underground or underworld&quot; as if we&#039;re somehow subhumans living in a sewer like meth crazed ninja turtles?<br /><br />Most of the new account scammers are probably BTKoin! lol<br /><br />Peace and Love - JWM

				If your buyers are FE then no worries. Really though! You got paid and sent them the stuff (even if they actually got it or not!). Let them bicker and argue all they want. When my buyers FE I just let them know that they are putting themselves at a risk of a &quot;No Refund.&quot;

				Excellent rant JWM. +1<br /><br /><br />I have never required a buyer to FE. It isn&#039;t because escrow makes my life easier, it is because escrow makes all of our lives *better*. It allows us to trust each other when we might otherwise not - this facilitates business.<br /><br />If a buyer knows they aren&#039;t going to be able to get on the SR within a day or two of receiving their package then I wouldn&#039;t mind if they finalized early. If they are just the type that forgets to finalize then again, I don&#039;t mind the FE. If a buyer has no problem finalizing in a reasonably prompt manner then it is better for everyone if they stay in escrow until they receive their package.<br /><br /><br />If I had a customer FE and they claimed the package didn&#039;t show then I would treat them the same way I would treat my escrow customers. If the DCN showed delivered (or &#039;undeliverable as addressed&#039;) then they are SOL. If it didn&#039;t show up because it got lost/intercepted/whatever then I would reship or refund, whichever they requested. Sure, if the package never showed up and they FE&#039;d then as a vendor you have the opportunity to screw that buyer over... but why? I guess you could do it to teach them a lesson but personally I would rather just do right by them.

				yeah man i dont order anything that isnt priority. im not 100% on this so someone correct me if im wrong but i think priority always comes with a dcn doesnt it? that solves all problems. i have never had anyone insist that i FE but i have a couple regular vendors here that i use all the time and i definitely trust them enough to FE if they were to ask. yeah it costs more to ship priority but it much safer and faster and i think that makes it worth it
