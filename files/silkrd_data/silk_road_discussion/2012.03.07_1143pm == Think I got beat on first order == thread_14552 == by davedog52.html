				I placed my first order last monday.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to get in to details yet because I&#039;m not sure if I am jumping the gun.&nbsp; I did read the wiki but the problem is I finalized early as per the seller&#039;s instructions for new buyers.&nbsp; Going off what was said about him in the forum and his feedback he seemed reputable.&nbsp; He&#039;s in the top 15% of sellers.&nbsp; Anyway my order was about 50 BTC.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t hear back so pm&#039;d him a couple times and he got back to me on Thursday with some excuses and said he would send out the order that night or the next day.&nbsp; Yesterday after mail came with no order I pm&#039;d him again and noticed on his seller&#039;s page it says his HD crashed over the weekend and he was backed up.&nbsp; I find this hard to believe.&nbsp; I PM&#039;d him again this morning asking for refund and still haven&#039;t heard back.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is protocol here before taking this to the forums?&nbsp; It&#039;s been 10 days for a USA --&gt; USA order and he isn&#039;t responding.&nbsp; Is there a certain amount of time I should wait?

				I understand if you don&#039;t trust the guy, but do you still want the stuff? Maybe you should just encrypt your mailing address and send it to him again.

				Sorry, actually I misread your post. I thought his hard drive crashed and then he backed up his data, as if he had lost your address in the crash... not that he was backed up with work.<br /><br />It&#039;s happened before for a &quot;trusted&quot; seller to disappear holding a lot of finalized orders, but I wouldn&#039;t worry too much, not yet anyway. If he&#039;s a big volume seller, it might be taking him a long time to get everything sorted. Or, he was getting out of the game anyway and saw a chance to get off with a bunch of free money.

				He seems to still be taking orders.&nbsp; I&#039;m surprised that no one else is saying anything.&nbsp; Although, there was a feedback entry listed on his page today calling him an asshole but then it disappeared.&nbsp; Strange.

				Why don&#039;t you disclose the vendors&#039; name here in the forums?<br /><br />If the forum serves to boost their reputation, it should also serve to expose things like this.

				You could have been a victim of a selective scammer<br />who goes after &quot;new&quot; members or others that only have<br />a handful of posts on the forums. Who are people going to believe<br />a vendor who has been around for some time or someone who<br />has just came upon the scene.<br /><br />Stay in escrow and do not finalize early <br />if the vendor doesn&#039;t offer escrow even though your new<br />move on to someone else who will.<br /><br />You should call out the vendor if he&#039;s not returning your emails<br />good luck&nbsp;

				He got back to me and said I should be receiving my package today or tomorrow.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t get it today, hoping for tomorrow.<br /><br />I see 2 problems with posting this experience with his name to the forum:<br /><br />a.&nbsp; I still want my shit or at least my money back.&nbsp; I&#039;m doubtful either will happen at this point but do not want to completely destroy any chance one will happen.&nbsp; For me to blow him up I will have to be 100% sure that I&#039;ve been beat. <br /><br />b.&nbsp; As a new buyer I have to be concerned about earning a good rep.&nbsp; If I do get my order or a refund I probably won&#039;t pursue exposing him any further.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already placed other orders with the same account and I don&#039;t want to have to start over with another account.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t see why stating the member&#039;s name should be any concern? If anything it will help others

				I agree. Just say the name. If he&#039;s legit he&#039;ll let you know and if not then others will know who to be wary of.
