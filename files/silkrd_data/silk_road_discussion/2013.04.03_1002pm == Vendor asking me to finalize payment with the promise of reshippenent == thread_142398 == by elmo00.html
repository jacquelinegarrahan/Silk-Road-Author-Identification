				I have an order in the resolution center, and my vendor had a refund policy that guaranteed a 50% refund after a 15 day extension. Now I would like to order from him again since he is trusted, however, I have been asked to finalize the payment with the promise of a reshippment. I don&#039;t feel comfortable doing that for a couple of reasons. One being that I would like to pay him since I am sure that the package was sent and secondly because it seems sketch. <br /><br />Is this usually done? How can I tactfully ask for a refund instead of a reshippment (without proof of an order)?

				Resolution is basically &quot;offer, counter-offer.&quot;&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t comfortable with something, offer your alternative.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t come to an agreement before the due date, support decides for you both.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the protocol usually is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had to use the resolution center other than for extensions, but the protocol doesn&#039;t really matter much.&nbsp; If you finalize anything, you&#039;re at the mercy of the vendor.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Support cannot and will not do anything to help you if you finalize.

The part I quoted was a bit confusing, because I am not sure how it would be &quot;sketch&quot; if you are tracking a package that is just taking longer than usual to arrive. As far as being tactful about asking for refunds, it should be pretty simple. If the vendor says they will have it to you in such time and it never shows, then they cannot provide a viable reason, you deserve a refund. I was never asked to FE early on any of my first transactions, and now that it&#039;s not necessary, I never will. I would rather lose a bit of cash than all. Hope this gives you a bit of insight.

				I am not FEing.&nbsp; A package was sent without tracking, however, I am going off of his feedback that he sent it. I was given a resolution and expected a partial refund at the end of the transaction so I could order once more (with tracking).

				This is basic practice, to prevent scams a finalize is needed before a re-ship. Only way a buyer could talk me out of it is if his stats were over $10k and very little to none refunds

The burden of doing what we are doing goes both ways when something doesnt get received. Seller lost product, buyer lost money, 50/50 down the middle, if buyer has less then maybe 5 transactions and its a large order, 0% is a good starting point but dont take it as a insult SR will usually do 50-51-52% for buyer.

				It was to my understanding that the vendor was required to have a DCN. That way when this issue occurs, they can give that to SR resolution center for proof they sent it. This poster shouldn&#039;t be relying on just information provided by the seller. I have never had to go this far either, but I do feel if the seller cannot provide proof that they sent it, a 100% should be given back. That gives the seller more incentive to ensure good packaging, service. BUT, we are all human (I hope) and mistakes happen. Just hang loose and hope for the best. 8)

				FTY guys <br /><br />The vendors policy is as stated:<br /><br />&nbsp;--Refunds--<br />Q : Can i get a refund ?<br />A : If your order isn&#039;t delivered after 30 days, you will get a 50% refund in bit coins<br />* please check at your local post order company before you request a refund<br /><br />Q : Can you resend the order?<br />A : No we don&#039;t resend old orders, after receiving your refund you can re-order<br /><br />I am sketched out because he explicitly states that he does not reship./resend. I would feel more comfortable ordering from him again so there is an actual order.

				Just ask for the 50% refund then if that&#039;s what you want.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they&#039;d go for it because then if you reorder they get 50% of the BTC from your original order plus 100% from your second order and you get protection through escrow.&nbsp; Seems like a win-win to me.

				If the vendor can not provide SR a tracking number to show he/she sent something then you should get 100% refund. From what you posted it sound like the item was not shipped in which case it is you who should be miss trusting not the vendor. A 50% refund policy does not protect a vendor who shipped nothing. Also keep in mind that scammers have been known to ship nothing in hopes of keeping half the money for doing nothing. I would just take your refund and find a better vendor.<br /><br />Medical cannabis: I know you are pissed and have every right to be. From what you described, the idiotic buyer is at fault in your case. I would fight tooth and nail to keep the money in your case. You upheld your part of the deal.<br /><br />You should post the buyers name in the forms so we can shame him/her for what was done to you. You earned the money in your case.<br /><br />

				Well.....hopefully people are reading these posts.....because i have another one.<br /><br />Now.......there are some areas that have mail slots....and only accept regular envelopes......my package is in a padded 8&#039; wide x 11 1/2&quot; tall x 3&quot; thick....and will not fit through the slot......i guess it is common in urban areas....and this customer<br />does not want to go the post office and pick up the package.....i guess you have to show ID.....but no signature is required........they do NOT want to go pick it up........and now it will be shipped back to the return address.....which is not me......but<br />it really screws up.....my process......the post office will wounder....why does this person who sent this package NOT live here......WHY.......WHY.......WHY.......<br /><br />To me that is just brutal.................listen up BUYERS...............its not just about getting your package..........it&#039;s about protecting both YOU and the SELLER.............<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve recently had problems with buyers demanding 100% refunds.. it&#039;s a joke really as people should really understand that in the business things will go topsy turvey from time to time and there is nothing we can do about it. If people arent willing to understand this and be reasonabglwe then they should not order. Rep is everything as well and to start rating vendors 1/5 as the item didnt show and they only get 50% refund is a joke!
