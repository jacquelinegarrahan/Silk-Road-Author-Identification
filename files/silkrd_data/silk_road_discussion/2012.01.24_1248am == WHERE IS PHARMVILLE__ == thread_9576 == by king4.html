				I wouldnt sweat it just yet.&nbsp; I also placed a shipment yesterday and haven&#039;t heard anything, but it was the weekend and I don&#039;t think pharmville&#039;s seller profile says anything about being active on the weekend.&nbsp; I think SR makes you wait 4 days before cancelling; not sure if this is 4 business days or not, but so long as your order still says processing, it&#039;s not quite time to freak out IMO.

				Pharmville managed to ship my order on the very first day it was possible (Early as hell). Being a noob buyer I realize how important it is to let these guys help us by not PMing the shit out of them.It is unfair to them and other buyers...I have learned a valuable lesson, trust pharmvilles quick shipping and PM only when its REALLY REALLY neccesary..<br />(i will copy and paste this in the other wheres pharmville post to clear up some slight panic of a few SR members)

				Give them a chance. It was the weekend. Maybe they were busy testing new products out. My order shipped the first possible day too. Unless shit is obviously going wrong I don&#039;t waste my time or theirs sending messages. If you need something right away there are other sellers that might ship faster.

				Yep this is not Amazon where they have lots of people working to process your order, these are normal people not high tech businesses so you just have to be a little patient.

				When I see the word &quot;everyone&quot; being used I can&#039;t help but wonder if you mean all the people that have ordered form them since Saturday or you.<br />You must realize they get 100+ messages daily on a wide variety of topics most of which probably have little to no relevance to the business at hand.&nbsp; So please have a little patience with the vendors, especially the ones who handle the type of business we have here.
