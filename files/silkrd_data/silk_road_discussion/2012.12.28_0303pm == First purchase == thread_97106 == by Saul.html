				Hi everyone reading this, hope you&#039;re having a great day!<br />I&#039;ve been reading the forums and visiting SR for a couple of months now and after making sure I had all the security I needed, I made my first purchase, which arrived today!<br /><br />I just wanted to thank everyone who has helped this noob along the way, the helpful forum posts and guides were vital to me being able to buy from here and the sense of community on this site is great. Keep up the great work everyone and happy travels :)<br /><br />Thanks<br />Saul<br />

				Hey Saul,<br /><br />Welcome to the club. Nothing beats the good feel when your first package gets delivered(only the product that gets delivered can beat it). It sure did pay off to be patient and persistent, right?<br />Anyway. wish you many successful purchases and a happy new year.<br /><br /><br />Regards<br />Chubz101

				I love it when threads like this happen. It shows how much there really is a nice community here, despite the impression some other threads may give.<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting on my 6th purchase to arrive.&nbsp; But that first purchase really stands out.&nbsp; It was the first time I had weed in my hands in nine long years.<br /><br />And what great weed it was. Two hits and I was sitting on the moon, in a wonderful dreamworld.&nbsp;
