			<dd class="postbody">
				As most of you are aware, Silk Road has been under a denial of service (DoS) attack for the last few days with the site being virtually inaccessible for about 36 hours.&nbsp; This was the most sophisticated attack we&#039;ve seen in the history of the site by far.&nbsp; I want to thank my team, and several volunteers from the community who quickly came to my aid and provided excellent support.&nbsp; You know who you are :)&nbsp; Ironically, I would also like to thank the attacker.&nbsp; &quot;What doesn&#039;t kill you only makes you stronger&quot; couldn&#039;t be more true here.&nbsp; We were forced to rethink our entire security system and configuration and are substantially more robust and hardened for having gone through this.&nbsp; I have zero respect for the attacker&#039;s tactics, but I have huge respect for his intellect, giving me confidence that we can and will overcome any future technology-based attacks on Silk Road.<br /><br />I want to mark this victory as a milestone in the ongoing story of our market by doing two things.&nbsp; One, we&#039;ll be having a sale effective immediately until midnight (UTC) on the 27th.&nbsp; All items on the site are commission free.&nbsp; I encourage any vendors who wish to join me in this to mark down their listings as much as they can.<br /><br />I am also publishing a document that is very important to me, the Silk Road Charter.&nbsp; It has been a work in progress for a very long time, and I am at last ready to share it with all of you.&nbsp; It has guided many incredibly difficult decisions I&#039;ve had to make along the way and will continue to do so hopefully for years to come.&nbsp; Hopefully many of you can identify with and find inspiration in it.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/charter<br /><br />Your faithful servant,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /><br />UPDATE (04/26/2013 2130 UTC): FYI some vendors have their prices set AFTER including the commission, so their prices didn&#039;t change when I reduced the commission to zero.&nbsp; There are only about 7 vendors doing this, so it shouldn&#039;t be a widespread effect.&nbsp; Hopefully they and others will manually reduce their prices and pass on the savings to their customers.&nbsp; Either way, this is an impromptu sale and I&#039;m not going to sweat it.

				Congratulations on over coming the DOS attack DPR. I&#039;m sure it was tiring, but as you said, it will make the security of the site stronger, which can only be a good thing :) <br /><br />The charter is pretty cool as well ;) Long live freedom...

				DPR ----<br /><br />Once again you have proved yourself to the best! The best leader we could all have. And u also proved that in some way you are not human!!! As it seems you did not sleep that 36 hours.... so I hope you finally got some rest&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />There has been multiple times in the past 2+ years that you have had to deal with something that forces you to shut down the road from a few hours up to 5+ days. And in every case there have been many, many threads made about how you are in some way trying to fuck us, the members of silk road, out of our btc. They say you have the site down to take from us, that the site will not come back up again and just about every other negative thing that can be said.<br /><br />But EVERY SINGLE TIME the site comes up better then before and of course ALL of our btc is in our accounts. Your honesty and integrity should never be in question but it seems to come up every time there is a situation where someone cant access there accounts. And I, along with many other members&nbsp; believe in you and this site and know that you are always doing everything you can to improve it and make it better for all of us. <br /><br />The smart ones also realize you do not need to shut down the site to take our btc..lol..you could just do it. But those of us that have been here long enough and have had interactions with you personally know better. I have had numerous situations with you...where you have ALWAYS done the right thing and in some cases you have done things that other people simply would never do. And it was always to my favor.&nbsp; Simply put...you are always trying to do the right thing. And a lot of people can not say that about themselves. <br /><br /><br />The&nbsp; charter you came up with&nbsp; is awesome. And I hope everyone reads it understands that everything you wrote in their you actually practice and have since day 1. So I thank you&nbsp; and EVERYONE&nbsp; ;) once again for getting the best site on the internet back up and running smoother then ever. As the site has never been faster!<br /><br />Also the community as a whole was pretty awesome in this situation. Most seemed to be patient and understand that you were doing everything in your power to get us back up and going. Yes there were a few assholes as usual and some of the crazies that always post there bullshit when the road is un-accessible&nbsp; for more then 15min...but it just go&#039;s to show you how important this place is to them. <br /><br />It is important for all of us to just focus on the positive and realize how lucky we are to be sharing this awesome ride with the best Captain we could ask for. It takes everyone to make this place run. And as you can see with the other sites that simple put are total shit...the reason we succeed is we have the best leader and the community. There are a lot of really great people here. I only hope it continues to get bigger and stronger. The one thing I am sure of...is that as long as DPR is the leader....we will always be the best....<br /><br /><br />THANK YOU DPR and crew!

				Even with the recent attacks on SR, our mission here is clear and concise. To truly have a free market economy, and to exercise the rights every human being is born with. Does it not also speak volumes that our Silk Road is hated and despised by those whose power is relinquished instantaneously through our unwavering use of it? This is a silent revolution. This is a revolution of our minds and thoughts, a war fought completely through the click click clicking of keyboards in the night. NO longer do we regurgitate the propaganda, or live in accordance with government mandated &#039;laws&#039; about which drugs are unacceptable and which you can buy at the local store. Oh no my friends, this is the beginning of something more grandiose and ubiquitous than even DPR himself knew it could be when he started it. People on every splotch of land are not given the opportunity to exercise free market, but have TAKEN the ability to choose for themselves in a world where they are too &#039;ignorant&#039; or too &#039;poor&#039;, or too &#039;uneducated&#039; to decide their own fate. No longer does big brother do all the thinking for you and let it trickle down. <br /><br />May Silk Road live on a thousand years, and may DPRs coffers always be full for his contribution to the human existence. Thank buddha, allah, and all the various gods that you have set us free with a few written words. You sir are a true visionary. <br />I humbly bow before thee.

				DPR et al.<br /><br />The services you offer are priceless. I&#039;m talking about more than money here, I&#039;m talking about ideals, morals and the freedom to choose, the freedom that should be life.<br /><br />My favourite part of the charter:<br /><br />&quot;Integrity<br />Honoring one&#039;s word as one&#039;s self. Word, thought, and action are aligned. &quot;<br /><br />&#039;Word, thought and action are aligned&#039;... something I have been working hard to be mindful about for quite a while now. Be impeccable with your word and use it for truth and love.<br /><br /><br />Thank you DPR and the team that help keep SR open.

				Glad that this issue was placed back under control. Hip hip hooray to Dread Pirate Roberts.<br /><br /><br />I am curious though, does anyone have any details on what exactly made this attack more sophisticated/intelligent. without going into the vulnerabilities that inevitably are going to be found in SR, could someone explain the nature of the offensive DDoS? Was it relying on redirection of traffic from multiple (possible compromised sites on Tor). Did it take advantage of whatever Tor services run concurrently on SR server(s), or was it relying on a network of zombie machines or a Bot-net?

				Just&nbsp; a warning for vendors - another scam<br /><br /><br />A message to all vendors:<br /><br />As you are all well aware by now, in light of the recent DDoS attack, I&#039;ve effectively dropped the commissions on the site until midnight on the 27th (UTC). I am reaching out to all vendors right now to encourage them to join me in this victory by marking down their listing price slightly for the time being.<br /><br />In essence, this will not effect you, as a vendor, at all. Taking off my commission means that I&#039;m taking the hit on this completely on my own.<br /><br />It is for this reason, I have set up a donation account. I know most vendors have their account set up to auto-withdraw, so that is why I set up a BitCoin Address to accept donations as well as a separate account. Any vendor that wishes to donate any of their earnings during this time period is free to do so to the following Bitcoin Address:<br /><br />1NeGAnBCzTsjnVkKpvXEZMe1M1D4TbVqTK<br /><br />This is NOT a mandatory donation, and nothing will be affected if you choose not to donate. This is just an account I set up to ease the burden on myself a little bit while still keeping the customers and vendors happy. I do not want to publicly post this message for the reason that I do not want anyone to feel pressured into donating. I am just informing you of the account, and letting you make the decision whether to donate or not. Either way, thankyou for being part of this wonderful community and allowing me the honor of working with all of you.<br /><br />Your faithful servant always,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts

				I am SO happy to be a vendor here serving this amazing community. The SilkRoad really is making history and we are all a part of it :) Knowing the way DPR ALWAYS handles any situation thrown in front of him and his team in a swift, quick manner ensuring that everybody&#039;s funds, orders and everything else is 100% safe is really an amazing feeling. I am so grateful to be a part of this revolution! <br /><br />In light of the sale we have lowered our prices and are hooking bags up extra fat, even more so than usual! :)<br /><br />Thank you so much DPR! What you have accomplished here has literally changed the whole &quot;black/underground&quot; market in ways I never would have imagined just a few years ago :) SilkRoad truly is amazing.

				<br /><br />I want to mark this victory as a milestone in the ongoing story of our market by doing two things.&nbsp; One, we&#039;ll be having a sale effective immediately until midnight (UTC) on the 27th.&nbsp; All items on the site are commission free.&nbsp; I encourage any vendors who wish to join me in this to mark down their listings as much as they can.<br /><br />&nbsp; I appreciate all the hard work you guys have been doing to try to get things rolling again, but I would not call the short lived success a victory by any means.&nbsp; Every time I try to open a page on the forum I have to reload five times, and still cant get on the road (been trying for 2 hours now)&nbsp; Maybe you guys should think about hiring the attacker.&nbsp; If hes one man he can do his job way better than the SR Staff.&nbsp; Good luck in future endeavors combating this prick.&nbsp; And lets all prey he gets killed in a car accident or house fire in the near future.<br /><br />

				Thank you DPR again! Hope this is not a reoccurring pattern to fuck the market up. I think it would be worse to attack for a day or two, then back down for a few days to let people place orders and then attack again to fuck everything up. I hope this is not the case :-\ <br /><br />At least im not bored bc there is no road BC I started a vendors account on Atlantis just to try it out.
