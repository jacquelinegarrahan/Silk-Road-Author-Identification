			<dd class="postbody">
				Ordered from a vendor with good feedback and a vendor for 4 months. Placed an order about 14 days ago and have not received yet. Also vendor hasn&#039;t been online in about that long. It&#039;s currently in resolution and expires soon. I&#039;ve left my comments but vendor hasn&#039;t added any of his. <br /><br />Has anyone had an experience like this and if so what was the outcome? It&#039;s really strange cause this vendor seems legit and I&#039;ve spoken to him a couple of times so I&#039;m not sure what to make of it. Thinking maybe sick or god forbid busted which I hope not.

				Oh sry to hear that. Been burned before and it was for a rather large order. This one is somewhat small but didn&#039;t finalize. In my experience when it goes to resolution it&#039;s mostly to the vendors advantage which I find unfair but w/e it is what it is. If it goes bad I will leave the Vendors name here. I&#039;d rather not because he seemed like a decent fellow. Maybe some r/l issues came up but nonetheless it&#039;s my money on the line.

				How are people getting burned if they aren&#039;t FEing? I think.. literally... that is the ONLY 1 thing you have to remember. Is to not FE. It is beyond me how people are still FEing ever, for anything, for anyone, ever, under any circumstances, (did I mention ever)?

				Guys guys guys I never said I ever finalized, I know better than that come on gimme some credit.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways I got a refund through SR Resolution. The vendor was Save on Drugs so I wouldn&#039;t order from him right now. It seems he went MIA cause he&#039;s had a lot of previous successful transactions.

				Just happened to me with vendor &#039;CharlieMustThrive&#039;.&nbsp; Of course I did not FE so it&#039;s all good... unfortunately, it lead to some pretty disastrous results IRL (expecting to receive heroin &#039;any day now&#039; leads to some dumb fiending purchases because &#039;I&#039;ll have more tomorrow so it&#039;s okay&#039;).
