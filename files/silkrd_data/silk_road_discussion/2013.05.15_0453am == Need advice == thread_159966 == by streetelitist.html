				So a vendor messages me saying &quot;please finalize your order&quot;. It&#039;s been about 3 days in transit and I haven&#039;t received anything yet, so I asked him why. He said &quot;because tracking says its delivered&quot;.<br />I was a little confused, because I know I should wait until I physically receive it to decide anything. I&#039;ve checked numerous times and it&#039;s not there, but he says the tracking says its delivered and he doesn&#039;t want me to delay the finalization because he needs the money. (It&#039;s a US DOMESTIC delivery btw)<br /><br />Should I wait and see if the package somehow turns up, or wait and take it to resolution?

				DO NOT FINALIZE until you have received the order and are happy with it.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t received it yet and since the vendor is claiming it was delivered (and using that as an excuse to pressure you about finalizing early), you may eventually want to click on &quot;resolve&quot; and send it to the resolution center BEFORE it autofinalizes.&nbsp;

				InfiniteSource I am somewhat agreeing with you,&nbsp; If you have the delivery confirmation that states the package was delivered to the address that the buyer provided, I would perhaps figure out a solution.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that you should have to eat the $120 if everything was done correctly on your end.&nbsp; You should have taken it to resolution, or tried to settle it between the two of you.&nbsp; You could have done this by simply showing the webpage that states the package was delivered to buyer&#039;s address.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				YOU might be the hands down, a total fucking idiot, shitty vendor. One thing is certain...based on your responses in here along with your OP..you have announced yourself as a new, young, and total fucking idiot. And you are a TERRIBLE example of a shit bag vendor. You should actually loose your vendor account over this. You wont ...but you should. And then for you at the end to throw in &quot;Thanks support&quot; shows again how stupid you are...as no one from SR support has even commented on this. The 2 mods that did are just that...mods. NOTHING to do with Silk Road. And they both gave great advice btw. And when there is a thread and not 1 person agrees with anything you say and you keep saying more stupid shit. YOU are dumb and clearly not about business.<br /><br />Also of note...the OP could not have been a &quot;cooler&quot; or &quot;calmer&quot; buyer that made a great post and in no way was bashing you. Though he should now.<br /><br />If you send a package via USPS Priority it takes 2-5 days. In this case it has been three days and you being a total loser messages the buyer and told him to FE as he has the package and you &quot;need&quot; the money. He then responds &quot; he has not received it&quot;. At that point...you should still be totally cool, explain to him that you have the dcn and tell him it shows.... delivered. Tell him the day and time it shows. So he can then &quot;make a&nbsp; check to see if he somehow has it and he does not know (ie. a roommate/wife/girlfriend got it) that happens! If he makes that check and still no package. You then give him the tracking number so he can see for himself!<br /><br />THERE IS NO REASON AT ALL YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE THE TRACKING NUMBER ...NONE!!! YOU FUCK STICK.<br /><br />&nbsp;In fact, that is what they are for..a problem or dispute! 99.999% of the time, if you are cool (your not) and you give it to them, and they see for themselves that it indeed&nbsp; shows &quot;delivered&quot; then they will finalize, as it is &quot;on them&quot;. The .001 that wont. Will 100% of the time &quot;lose&quot; the dispute if it gets that far. Of course, that is&nbsp; assuming you indeed have a legit tracking. And there is a better chance Rosie O&#039;donell wins the super pipe in the next Olympics in snowboarding.But again, it will never go there if you&nbsp; just provided it. He would have&nbsp; see you in fact.... got it there very fast. He will see that you are just on top of shit. And YOU WIN. But in your case he has a better chance of seeing Elvis. And you could not see shit. Other then you are a thumb dick. But we all have seen that about you.(that&#039;s a compliment)<br /><br />Your reaction in here is the worst I have ever seen. And I have been here over a year and seen it all. And though in here you totally over reacted, and said all kinds of stupid shit.that even a girl would not say, it is&nbsp; so&nbsp; hard&nbsp; for me to to go forward with a message about how fucking terrible you acted because you did not&nbsp; do one thing correct. And that is hard to do.<br /><br />And your attitude is so poor, that you are a liability to SR and this community. And you are way to new and have no sales at all to even consider...I mean even whisper... you are correct in any way. And the fact you claim to have a DCN ....that say&#039;s &quot;delivered&quot; and you do not provide it to a customer in this situation and&nbsp; you want to wait for 17 days plus days to give it to SR is really fucking stupid. <br /><br />I assume the fact you contacted&nbsp; him so fast and it was this small an order, you are a very penny vendor.And the $120 is a lot to you. And you confirmed that....but of course in your great writing style you told us ....or you bragged how you made 4k+ that week or month or whatever..then in your next loser breath you say something like you spent the food check on Express shipping!<br /><br />First lets talk about a food check!!! Holy shit...how fucking scummy are you? Who gets a &quot;food check&quot; and you spent it all on Express shipping??? What do you eat.... Top Ramen and a god dam potato?&nbsp; This is another example of a vendor that is very under bankrolled to be a vendor and on top of the &quot;bond&quot; they should be required to send a picture of them holding 5k cash to pay for stuff like shipping an other items so they do not sound like losers who brag about 4k, then cry about a food check and spending it on shipping!<br /><br />It would be so simple for you to get paid. And then you acting like an idiot and marking it as &quot;never received&quot; and if you are indeed telling the truth&nbsp; and you have 60+ orders&nbsp; and all 5/5... you just&nbsp; fucked your self for penny&#039;s. And for no reason at all. As your account and feedback take a hit! And the worst part for you is you keep typing! You CLEARLY are high and stupid. We are all high, but you are stupid high. Great combo I.S!<br /><br />[/quote]<br /><br />I saw the lynch mob grabbing picks so I did what I could to diffuse what was happening. It was starting to turn into, &quot;YOU WANTED HIM TO FE?&quot; &quot;I HOPE YOU BURN IN HELL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!&quot;<br />[/quote]<br /><br />There was no lynch mob and no one was saying you were asking him to FE. They were saying<br /><br />&quot; Hey idiot...if you have a dcn..give it up and you will get your money&quot;<br /><br />When you refused and you start ranting and raving...every single person believes your lying! Or just DUMB AS SHIT(both)<br /><br />[/quote]<br /><br />Wrong. The address he told me had received the package, according to the USPS.&nbsp; What the fuck is the point in having tracking if support wants to stammer around saying &quot;you asked him to finalize? Oh no, he never got the package. You have tracking? Well he never got the package. You said tracking? He never got the package.&quot; When the vendor with 40 transactions and 100% good feedback is thought of as being the one lying the system is broken. Might I add out of the several dozen orders I filled over this week, this one single user is the ONLY ONE to have a problem.<br /><br />I asked him to finalized once because I saw the package was delivered to the provided address. Stop turning this into something its not. Suddenly the word finalized is some dirty word. I ASKED HIM TO FINALIZE THE ORDER AFTER USPS MARKED IT AS DELIVERED TWO DAYS AGO. TWO DAYS.<br /><br />Around and around we go.<br /><br />[/quote]<br /><br /><br />What the fuck are you talking about??? When did you provide&nbsp; &quot;support&quot; with the tracking? Who has seen the tracking to back up your claim?&nbsp; The point of having a DCN is for you to provide it as proof you sent it. Provide it, with the address he provided and you win. It could not be simpler. <br /><br />The forum mods are trying to talk sense into you. Clearly that is not possible. The only one going around and around&nbsp; is you. And all this over $120 bucks??? DIRTBAG.<br /><br />If any thread should be locked at some point , it is this one with this vendors bullshit. I suggest all buyers reading this, go to SR and to his vendor account and report him. And if any single person that reads this...thinks about buying from him...lol.<br /><br />I.S to us a favor...overdose...though I doubt you have the supply to do it. And god knows you have no god dam money to buy supplies to take your life. Maybe you will starve to death.<br /><br />I demand you tell us about a &quot;food check&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				Infinite you are kinda playing the victim now.&nbsp; If you took a picture of the screen with the USPS confirmation on it, cover up your address and anything that you don&#039;t want buyer to know, but show him his information and where it says the shit was delivered.&nbsp; Then you can tell him to eat a dick and/or eat a bowl of dicks.&nbsp; That way it will show that you did your part and unfortunately he did not do his good enough.&nbsp; You seem to be in a bitchy mood, my solution is EASY and would rectify this situation quickly.&nbsp; If you are not going to show him proof of delivery, then shut up and take the loss like a big boy.

Now in this case..I could destroy the copy of the express label and just use the receipt just like I do for priority as I would just have city and zip... But there is no rule about us not keeping those for the one day it takes the express package to be delivered....and if for some reason it doe snot get there the next day by 3pm or 12pm (only options) then you need that to get a refund.. and since it is only 1 day it is not an issue if we keep them until it is delivered and the buyer finalizes... Or you could come back from the post office and destroy that&nbsp; copy right away...kind of silly and no need. I staple everything...and then the next day as soon as they finalize I then shred them..<br /><br />And I am sure every vendor does it different...and in my case I have had 46 express packages in 1 day. And I am sure other vendors have had more...but in general you would think less pay for that option...but in my sales (Rx Pain Pills) 90% of the buyers pay the $20 for over note vs. the $7 for 2-5 days...<br /><br />But you were addressing can we &quot;keep the address&quot; after we ship and of course the answer is NO...and actually not one vendor wants it anyways..but keeping the receipt is not considered keeping the address in USPS Express situations) and in USPS Priority situations..we all just use the labels and go from the order page where we can see the address....fill it out..and get it off...I do not mark in transit right after I send it as I wait until It is at the post office but I think a lot of vendors do fill it out then mark in transit..and there is no prob with that as&nbsp; it is &quot;in transit&quot; once it is packaged&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Hope that clears it all up...and of course I am only talking about USPS Express and Priority. I am sure some use Fed Ex and UPS...and those produce labels like Express.<br /><br />

				Simple solution. Send a photoshopped pic of your tracking to buyer. Done and done. If you are right, your cred is back. If not, you suck at being a vendor. And if it doesn&#039;t matter anymore, next time, you know to send that proof of delivery to SR support and you will win your case. There should be no other things you should be doing but these 2 options. No reason to talk any further about this. JUST DO IT!!!!<br />

				Just throwing in my 2 cents before Libertas locks in<br /><br /><br />Totally confused as why he just can&#039;t provide the tracking. I provide tracking to all my customers who request it. All I ask is that they setup PGP because I refused to send it unenvrypted, and if they demand so I do it only on the condition that I am completely removed from any liability towards the package safety, which is usually enough to get them to setup PGP.<br /><br />If a customer orders with tracking, they should get exactly that. ?<br /><br />Me confused =S. <br /><br />WShark

Go to the res. centre if you want any chance of getting any % back but buyer didn&#039;t get what he &#039;paid&#039; for so cant blame him either.

				Going to leave this open - after giving it more thought I don&#039;t actually see any *need* to have it locked. The denigration that was taking place of the vendor involved was what made me consider that the thread had served its original purpose and had degraded into something unneeded, but I can&#039;t justify locking it when attempting to balance that with my personal goal of ensuring freedom of speech, so it will be left open unless the original poster requests that it is closed.<br /><br />Libertas

Your kinda of a douche bro.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lmao if that is true, if it is true im sure we wont see the proof but if it is that should probably be investigated by mods/admins too.<br /><br />Just the way Rxking talks is annoying me, in fact i hate when people name call, there are much more clever ways to insult if that&#039;s your sort of thing.&nbsp; But then again why must we insult, it makes us all look childish and your point can be proven much more efficiently without insults of any kind.<br /><br />As for the main issue, it seems as if there is the easiest solution but vendor chooses to ignore so oh well. Go to the res. centre if you want any chance of getting any % back but buyer didn&#039;t get what he &#039;paid&#039; for so cant blame him either.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;If i is true LMAO&quot; <br /><br />So what makes you laugh out loud, is if I was to send this lying vendor a private message telling him to lower his prices on Adderall? That would make you laugh out loud? And forum&nbsp; Mods should investigate it along with SR administrators? This proves with out a doubt, that you, Jack off spades is dumb as shit. Oh no, your annoyed because I name call and I won&#039;t stand for lying.<br /><br />Let me tell you what annoys me. First, members that are stupid enough to put a donation address for coins in their signature. When there is no reason, what so ever,that any person would ever give you anything but shit for your lack of sense of humor and you inability to clearly see when another member, that actually has a vendors account, and therefore is held to a higher&nbsp; standard of integrity and is expected to &quot;do the right&quot; when it comes to selling and shipping drugs on the REAL site of Silk Road. Yet that member, a vendor named InfiniteSource, is CLEARLY being a total fucking moron and is making a NON SITUATION....a situation... by simply not doing the easiest thing that could be done and&nbsp; give a little piece of information that would clear this up in 5 seconds and instead decides to post ludicrous statements and completely ignore common sense and every single person that has a brain cell left that has seen this thread and give proof he sent it and it was delivered. And instead of doing that, he ignores it and starts just making up shit in this thread.<br /><br />&nbsp;So much so that there are some idiots in here, YOU/ the vendor,that lose sight of the REAL problem and instead try and focus the intention on another vendor, my excellent self, that has been a Vendor for over a year and has the best feedback/ reputation for selling drugs you could possibly have on the dark net because they do not like that I refuse to be nice to the LIARS and the total idiots that only cause problems on Silk Road. I use these forums for what they are really here for...to warn and help buying members of Silk Road navigate the road and not get ripped off. The ONLY thing I care about is people get what they paid for. PERIOD. Drugs or BTC to buy drugs or other items on Silk Road. I do not care about anything else. And neither should you.<br /><br />I do not give a fuck about being PC. Or other week ass pussies that get their feelings hurt when called a name. They deserve the name calling. They should be exposed. This place needs me. 100&#039;s of people trust me with there money and there personal information every day on Silk Road and they know I deliver 100% of the time. And that I will not bullshit them or say stupid shit. I take NO SHIT. And I say what needs to be said.<br /><br />I am not some loser that ask for donations and brings not one thing at all to these forums(like yourself). I am not jealous, nor would I ever be able to take one thing&nbsp; that is said in these forums personal. I could not even imagine being in these forums for no reason at all (like yourself) and posting.... that I think other forum members are &quot;mean&quot;.<br /><br />So delete your forum account and go look in the mirror and ask yourself&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;would anyone care if I died?&quot; <br /><br />The answer is NO. <br /><br />Yet if I don&#039;t answer a message within 30 min on Silk Road on a Monday- Friday from 12pm to 8pm I will have 45 messages asking me if I am &quot;ok&quot;. They want to know if I possibly have a cramp in my hand. Or a headache. Or&nbsp; if one of my 7 Tv&#039;s is not working. They are that concerned abut me. <br /><br />But with you.... You could die right now and it would not matter.No one would notice.My dogs farts last longer then anyone in this world thinks about you. And what is really funny, is both things smell exactly the same.<br /><br />Good day.

( no need for the kill yourself stuff but ) +1..<br /><br />Libertas has proven himself to be a calm, informative, level headed mod and a real asset to the forums. <br /><br />Libertas, when your name popped up in the customer support thread answering some questions a couple weeks ago I had to flick Scout and SSBD a message to see if you were actually a mod or just some mad forum user dishing out some advise. Since then I have seen you deal with a lot on here and give out some very solid advise to those in need.<br /><br />Keep up the good work bro...<br /><br />Thanks to those that contributed something worth reading to the thread...<br />

				The dude is not making friends over in the meth vendor thread at rumor mill either...one has taken to referring to him as &#039;InfiniteSores&#039; ;D<br /><br />It is interesting how it goes though, if a vendor comes on the forums and makes an ass of themselves I&#039;m sure there are loads of people like me who wouldn&#039;t entertain the idea of buying from them with a ten foot pole...for some reason the good vendors never seem to get into these sort of predicaments!<br /><br />

				Hi everyone. I know I have been absent, but I think I need to bring something to everyones attention.<br /><br />The users southpaw, rxking, just recently trainsTrtainsTRAINS, and the person Libertas just patted on the back, 1mIcedout,&nbsp; are all the same users. I believe RxKing has several vendor accounts he is using to gain trust and scam. RxKing has several forum accounts. Look at the style of writing, its something that can&#039;t be missed. Tons more evidence can be found over at my last couple of posts in the meth thread. This user is manipulating the forums, and scamming people.<br /><br />I believe the new account &quot;crystal ship&quot; is RxKings soon to be fe scam account. More evidence over at my posts in the meth thread.<br /><br />This user stands to GAIN from my down fall. This user has been allowed to screw people out of money, and lie to everyone here. I&#039;m so glad we have &quot;free speech.&quot; I am a good vendor who has 100% rating. Don&#039;t be manipulated. <br /><br />Why are these certain accounts that all write the exact same out to get me so hard?

				Yeah those three periods I used after that one sentence really gave me away.&nbsp; It&#039;s called &#039;ellipses&#039;, dumbshit, and a lot of people incorporate them into their writing style!&nbsp; What are you, the fucking grammar polizei now??? <br /><br />&nbsp;There is a fine line between troll and vendor and you seem to not even realize a line exists.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br />For some reason I feel like going back to the meth vendor review thread and posting a link to this just so they can all laugh at you again (in a different but just as hilarious context) in case anyone there missed it.
