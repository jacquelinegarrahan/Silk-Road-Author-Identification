				You can do cash deposits at Bank of America for bitfloor.<br /><br />A $500 deposit is about a ~$3 fee.<br /><br />BitMe offers cash desposits at chase banks.<br /><br />Both exchanges have low liquidity though

				Bitfloor, with it&#039;s tiny fees and Monday-Saturday availability, has replaced Bitinstant in the meager battle for my business.<br /><br />The King is dead; long live the King.&nbsp; Until the next major DOS attack or glitch.&nbsp; ;)

				As far as I know there are 4 places to get coins using an anonymous bank deposit method.<br />1. Bitme- just read about this one in this thread so I don&#039;t know much about it. Their site says cash deposits are free but others may charge fees, whatever that means.<br />2. ziggap.com- they usually allow deposits at chase bank but last I looked that feature was disabled. It said it will be back soon, tho. Don&#039;t know how much the fees are.<br />3. bitfloor- I just used these guys yesterday. From bank deposit to SR wallet less than 2 hours elapsed. I deposited just over 100 and received just under 100. My guess is about a %3-%4 fee structure.<br />4. Blue Sky Traders- I have read other people have used them but I couldn&#039;t access their page with Tor. Says no response from server. <br /><br />Here is a dedicated thread by jshizzle23 that has the lowdown on all these places and reviews of user&#039;s experiences. If anyone knows any other cash deposit options or which is definitely the least expensive please post here and also in the thread below. Thanks people!!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124355

				bitinstants site at the bottom in a yellowish background(partially colorblind) says they should be back on for all services by tomorrow, I just looked and their site is down on load/ping ect. Hopefully they are in full throttle fix mode.
