				It looks like they allow anybody to be a vendor. That makes me suspect that they may not be LE, although it certainly doesn&#039;t prove anything at all. If they didn&#039;t allow anybody to be a vendor then I would certainly suspect that they are LE. As long as they allow anybody to vend, it shouldn&#039;t matter too much if they are LE, because real security is and always has been in the hands of vendors and customers. Having a secure site helps too, but it certainly isn&#039;t a requirement, or even something that you should count on. So long as they allow anybody to be a vendor, we can conclude that it is not likely for all of the vendors operating there to be FBI. At this point, although not writing off the notion that they could indeed be LE, I am more inclined to worry that they may be scammers. I doubt that they have a much more secure system than SR, if at all, despite their claims, although it could be possible they have hardened the server a bit more (again, this shouldn&#039;t be a whole lot of concern to customers or vendors , provided they are actually making their own security and not foolishly relying on a server to give them security). I see they have some innovative features, the most interesting that I see being automatic encryption of orders and messages to vendors public keys. That wont do shit to protect from an attacker who is already in control of the server, and most certainly shouldn&#039;t be relied upon, but in the event that the server is legitimate currently, it will provide forward security of all messages (which means messages sent prior to a compromise will not be compromised, provided it is implemented correctly). SR claims to delete all messages / orders I believe, but I would be more confident in an automatic encryption system that never has plaintext leave memory honestly, in either case the end goal is the same but data recovery off a platter that hasn&#039;t been wiped with something like secure erase is much more plausible than breaking a ciphertext that hasn&#039;t had its plaintext ever stored on the disk. I believe SR also runs everything out of a mounted encrypted container, and while this is arguably better than nothing, from a technical perspective I have to say that in this particular area I think Atlantis has a more *potentially* secure system (having vendors upload public keys and encrypting all messages that are not already encrypted with that public key). I would actually like to request that SR adds this feature :). <br /><br />That said the one certain thing that SR has that this site does not have is a history of not running away with all of the Bitcoins in the escrow, and that is something to keep in mind before considering using an alternative marketplace (and its escrow system). Also, it is feasibly an FBI sting still, it is widely known that very few people actually encrypt their addresses on SR (for fuck knows what reason), and if the FBI is in control of a server that has a lot of unencrypted addresses going through it, they could harvest them and lead a significant international bust. But since anybody can vend, we can be pretty confident that not all vendors are LE, and provided the vendors and customers use proper security themselves, it should be roughly no more or less safe than SR , from an LE perspective (provided they always let anybody vend, and of course that customers and vendors are being secure themselves, something that they may be banking on not being true. Also I suppose they could try to MITM GPG key transfers, but it should be just as possible to detect such behavior there as it is here, although if we already have faith in SR it seems like a bad idea to put faith in a competitor site, as the more faith you put in the more things the more likely you are to end up fucked...).

				Thing is I honestly don&#039;t know or give a whole lot of a shit if they are police, I like the SR community and have been here for a good while now, don&#039;t use the marketplace of SR and have no plans to use the marketplace of any other site. I am just commenting on it from what I can gather, and although I agree it is entirely possible they are LE , I just don&#039;t see the red herring that you seem to see that makes it so they *obviously* are LE, and my honest opinion is simply that you have nothing but a gut feeling to go off of. That said, LE did run a drug forum once, and it was apparently their knee jerk reaction upon discovering the existing drug forums, so it seems like not much of a stretch that they would do the same in the case of public drug dealing websites. However, this new market is a hidden service (the FBI forum blocked access via Tor and said only scammers use it), they allow messages to be encrypted with GPG (even adding a potentially worthless automatic encryption feature, hopefully nobody relies on it, but I am sure almost everybody will, which sucks, as it is quite possibly completely worthless, but better than nothing I suppose) and they allow anybody to be a vendor. None of those things pop out and say police to me, although having all of those things also doesn&#039;t pop out and say not police to me, only potentially not police. Just my two cents :D.

They have vendors from SR verify themselves (for example, by using their PGP keys) and then those vendors can use the same username on Atlantis. If it is the same vendor, I can hardly see why you would be afraid of ordering on Atlantis, especially since they have extra stats that buyers can use to determine vendor honesty. On SR it is pure guess work.

That makes me suspect that they may not be LE, although it certainly doesn&#039;t prove anything at all. If they didn&#039;t allow anybody to be a vendor then I would certainly suspect that they are LE. As long as they allow anybody to vend, it shouldn&#039;t matter too much if they are LE, because real security is and always has been in the hands of vendors and customers. Having a secure site helps too, but it certainly isn&#039;t a requirement, or even something that you should count on. So long as they allow anybody to be a vendor, we can conclude that it is not likely for all of the vendors operating there to be FBI. At this point, although not writing off the notion that they could indeed be LE, I am more inclined to worry that they may be scammers. I doubt that they have a much more secure system than SR, if at all, despite their claims, although it could be possible they have hardened the server a bit more (again, this shouldn&#039;t be a whole lot of concern to customers or vendors , provided they are actually making their own security and not foolishly relying on a server to give them security). I see they have some innovative features, the most interesting that I see being automatic encryption of orders and messages to vendors public keys. That wont do shit to protect from an attacker who is already in control of the server, and most certainly shouldn&#039;t be relied upon, but in the event that the server is legitimate currently, it will provide forward security of all messages (which means messages sent prior to a compromise will not be compromised, provided it is implemented correctly). SR claims to delete all messages / orders I believe, but I would be more confident in an automatic encryption system that never has plaintext leave memory honestly, in either case the end goal is the same but data recovery off a platter that hasn&#039;t been wiped with something like secure erase is much more plausible than breaking a ciphertext that hasn&#039;t had its plaintext ever stored on the disk. I believe SR also runs everything out of a mounted encrypted container, and while this is arguably better than nothing, from a technical perspective I have to say that in this particular area I think Atlantis has a more *potentially* secure system (having vendors upload public keys and encrypting all messages that are not already encrypted with that public key). I would actually like to request that SR adds this feature :). <br /><br />That said the one certain thing that SR has that this site does not have is a history of not running away with all of the Bitcoins in the escrow, and that is something to keep in mind before considering using an alternative marketplace (and its escrow system). Also, it is feasibly an FBI sting still, it is widely known that very few people actually encrypt their addresses on SR (for fuck knows what reason), and if the FBI is in control of a server that has a lot of unencrypted addresses going through it, they could harvest them and lead a significant international bust. But since anybody can vend, we can be pretty confident that not all vendors are LE, and provided the vendors and customers use proper security themselves, it should be roughly no more or less safe than SR , from an LE perspective (provided they always let anybody vend, and of course that customers and vendors are being secure themselves, something that they may be banking on not being true. Also I suppose they could try to MITM GPG key transfers, but it should be just as possible to detect such behavior there as it is here, although if we already have faith in SR it seems like a bad idea to put faith in a competitor site, as the more faith you put in the more things the more likely you are to end up fucked...).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 for ya&nbsp; :)<br /><br />It&#039;s always nice to hear you chime in on these things.

You have to have faith in your best instincts from now on.<br /><br />To respond to your statements I have only this to say.<br /><br />Um..... no, actually the government does anything and everything it possibly can to pull in every single cent it possibly can to pay back the money they owe to the globalists. Which we all know to actually be the Fed times one million at least. <br /><br />LE has now become in all actuality the new generation of small time &quot;robber barons&quot; of old. Small and large, the US Department of Justice, the DOD, the NSA and the CIA, and many more not really needed to type completely out, have long since run the drug trade. They are all under the control of the people who have the most power, which of course is who, well I&#039;ll give you a hint, they now have the entire Metro Boston City Area under their custody and control. And why?<br /><br />Ok, if we aren&#039;t asking these questions ourselves then we are definitely not focusing on the real &quot;big picture&quot;. I can&#039;t even go into real detail about this due to the fact that that anything I reference someone will call me out on it and call me a f&amp;@king terrorist. So to hell with anyone who doesn&#039;t have enough common sense to actually ask the real questions here. <br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t know if I will even be ordering anything until we have a though security &quot;quality assurance&quot; test conducted here. They now have complete control of the clearnet as we speak; this is a fact.&nbsp; Who is to say that we do not have any serious security threats going on here in the basement? <br /><br />Process this, I dare you.&nbsp; Who is the world&#039;s largest supplier of drugs to the entire planet beyond this or any other black market. You guessed it, the world&#039;s largest investor in crypto-currency&#039;s, the U.S. <br /><br />Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha............. <br /><br />Jesus,<br /><br />I am calling you out. You who are monitoring every word that is said on these forums and always have been. Flagging many more posts than our mods who work their asses off to steer all of us in the right direction with our discussions here on this forum. I have faith in our mods, they do the best they can with, well, no real power. I salute you kind sirs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Step forward and tell me who truly runs one of the largest markets in the known world. The drug trade........ <br /><br />DPR, I have always put my undying trust in you my friend. If you truly are the Pirate you say you are, you will flex to us and our enemies the true might we all know you have. We have been mainstream for a considerably long amount of time. <br /><br />Mainstream only gets you one thing in this world.&nbsp; Taxed until you die............. Most of the time that is with a black bag and team of mercs...<br /><br />This foresworn is my testimony. Bound by the only thing I have.... My word.......... Which stem from much more credible sources than our FBI, who are informed by unknown sub-concept groups of the CIA, who in turn tell the mainstream and now the entire social media agenda. Does any of this sound familiar? <br /><br />Tor supposed to be secure, not allowing anyone to see where exactly you are logging in from.&nbsp; Bullshit.&nbsp; Not anymore. Anyone who has noticed the crazy things currently going on, in our &quot;Matrix&quot; escape, and in deep into the &quot;Matrix&quot; itself exploring everything else that makes this realm such a glorious place we can call home. <br /><br />I am getting sick and tired of these giant government internet securities contractors who have always caused us headaches and haven&#039;t even started pushing us around yet.<br /><br />By the way, this will be the perfect time to out some parasites. If anyone quotes anything I have said here, without giving any evidence to the contrary of which I have spoken in solemn confidence here with only my fellow realists on this road, shall they be outed as being against what it is we truly strive for here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Freedom. The freedom of having an actual free market we can call our own. If you are against freedom, then you are a threat to everyone using this site with confidence of their privacy on this site and anywhere else for that matter. Against the anonymity we have always worked so hard to keep not only here but the entire net. <br /><br />Please, I have finding it hard to sleep at the moment.&nbsp; If anyone would like to discuss this further I will starting my own thread labeled &quot;Freedom of Anonymity&quot;. If you would like to ask questions or share anything any of us truly should know, or anyone who would like to fess up to what you know.&nbsp; Please, I urge you to post. <br /><br />We are at war....
