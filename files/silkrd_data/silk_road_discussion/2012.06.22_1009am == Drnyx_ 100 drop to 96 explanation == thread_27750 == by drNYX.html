				Like I said in my message to you don&#039;t let the bastards get you down, for the people that know and appreciate the level of service and commitment you show to the valued customers you hold, they will always be there for you no matter how skewed the SR rating system fucks you over. Decent customer service, stealth, security and good old hard work on your part will always show and always bring you custom from people who know you best and at the end of the day don&#039;t give two fucks over your points rating from the system in place.<br /><br />from the 28 transactions on my account Dr Nyx is by far and away the best and stealthiest shipper of products I have seen and long may it continue<br /><br />Sat

				+1<br /><br />Forget these morons Doc. Your track record, commitment to stealth shipping and your communication&nbsp; speaks for itself. If a buyer has the intention to handle the matter in a civil and for all parties satisfying way I&#039;m sure there would never be a reason to give a 1/5,.<br /><br />Let me take a wild guess, were these international orders? I&#039;m astonished anyhow how much makes it through some country&#039;s customs. Well, I for one couldn&#039;t care less if you have 96 or a perfect 100. ;)<br /><br />Don&#039;t let this get you down!

				I&#039;ve never ordered from you (I don&#039;t order internationally, or else I would have), but I just wanted to let you know that I don&#039;t care about what your rating is. I look at total number of transactions, how long you&#039;ve been on SR, and what people say about you here on the forums. Based on all of that, I&#039;d be quite happy to place an order with you, despite the 96. I deal with people on a regular basis who have an even lower score, due to a small handful of assholes. Don&#039;t let them get you down!

				Well, I just put my first order in with you and I can&#039;t wait to see it in my mailbox. It sounds like they were either other vendors or just the type to not do business with in general&nbsp; :-\ . Luckily with each successful order, their bitching shall become less and less statistically significant until they are just a small .01 away from 100%. :D I&#039;ll gladly add to the pool once my mailbox&#039;s appetite is sated. :D<br /><br />-Cheers

				You&#039;d still be my go to guy for molly regardless of someone&#039;s negative feedback. Don&#039;t let the odd disgruntled customer get on your nerves, you still offer the best prices and ship internationally, thus some issues are bound to come up from time to time.

				I think it&#039;s really cool and smart that you have a VIP and MIP status available.<br />Those 1&#039;s suck man but don&#039;t let it burn you too much, your customers have there own experiences and they will always come back to you as long as their experiences is fair. To be honest if your sales stays about the same it will be back up in a month. Also a 96 is nothing to be looked at negatively, low 80&#039;s is where i start to question the rep. Anyway most 100rep vendors dont sell daily. Me for example. I make like 1 or 2 sales a week and of course that 1 or 2 are gonna get the best possible service i can provide. They usually get free priority postage.<br /><br />Hope this helps I know the system is wonky but I promise I have nothing to do with the way it works.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad<br /><br />

				Look drnyx.... You keep saying, admitting rather that you scammed me for ONLY 13 bucks. Which is true because you never shipped off what I ordered. YOU told me it was shipped so I let it auto-finalize. You cannot expect me to give you 5/5 when I dont have a refund or product. I told you I would gladly give you a 5/5 if I received the product or got a refund. We can keep bitching for ever at each other or you can give me my 2.5 BTC back, ill change feedback to 5/5 and we can never talk to each other again.

				I think a big reason for your rating drop is rude and/or failure in communications.<br /><br />I heard of one guy who you demanded use privnote after he submitted his address with your public key.&nbsp; When he rightfully refused, you stopped communicting, ignoring his PMs.&nbsp; You never sent the sample, nor did you refund his shipping.&nbsp; Granted it is only a sample and the shipping was only 1.5 BTC.&nbsp; But it is the principle.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t even get a sample right, why should I trust you for a real order?

That makes no sense at all. Of all the vendors I ordered from, the Doc was the ONLY one who did not ignore my public key but was using PGP for ALL of our communication. All down to the trivial stuff. I understand it costs time to encrypt messages and some vendors seem to have a too big of a workload for that but I liked it and it was one of the reasons I came back to him.<br /><br />Then again I too would never order from a vendor without a public key in his profile.

				I&#039;m gonna be honest here for a second. I don&#039;t believe drNyx has ever scammed anyone. He is one of the last honest people I have met while doing business. I have had water sold as Methadone to me, I have been sold Heroin which made me literally sick to my stomache (don&#039;t give me a stupid explanation that this is normal. I have been doing H for the better pat of the last decade and I know what I&#039;m doing) and the color being more or less a BigBird yellow (people will know who I&#039;m talking about). <br /><br />And then I started doing business with the Dr. and I am actually sort of touched. When I was low money wise he put his trust in me and sent something out which made my week bearable. I think anybody going through WDs knows what I&#039;m talking about. Nyx literally saved my ass (more than once) and we have never met face to face. We went from a pretty good customer relationship to something I might consider a weird sort of friendship. I trust him with more money than I have ever trusted anyone with in my life. He has never let me down, not ONCE. <br /><br />People saying that he&#039;s a scammer make me laugh and fucking angry at the same time. How DARE you even suggest this? Yes his English isn&#039;t the best, so what? It&#039;s not his first fucking language. I wanne see any of you Yanks talk French or any other European language for that matter. Anybody who doubts me may contact me directly and ask me about drNyx and I will happily vouch for him. <br /><br />Just like he said Johnnycottonseed probably had a horrible attitude and a mouth on him which would have made anyone angry. There is something truly wrong with the ongoing scammer problem on SR. This sort of community only works with trust and anybody exploiting this is ruining a great thing we have going on. I would bet my life on the fact that drNyx did anything within his power, why wouldn&#039;t he? He could have refunded no problem (especially with the low amount of BTCs in question), the question is: Should he? <br /><br />He did what was right. He stood his ground and paid the price (4% rating). How great is that? Customers don&#039;t have to take everything that sellers throw at them BUT neither do Sellers. I say: &quot;Good for you drNyx. Keep up the good work and I promise you we (I) will keep buying!&quot; <br /><br />Much love Bro
