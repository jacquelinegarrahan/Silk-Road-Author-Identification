				Address most likely blacklisted.<br /><br />Tell me though, how were you informed of the seizure? What product did you order? How much? From who? Domestic or international?<br /><br />Because some vendors have in the past tried the dastardly act of putting an official looking government style seizure letter in an empty parcel, taping it up and then retaping it so it looks like its been searched, and then keeping the cash without sending the product.<br /><br />Not saying that&#039;s happened here, just saying it has in the past.<br /><br />

				This was also mentioned in a thread a while back. It sounds like something that really happened. <br /><br />How would someone prove it was a fake letter? It would be very easy to forge a fake letter.

				I, too, and interested in getting the answer to this question.&nbsp; But to check every package&#039;s address to see if it&#039;s been flagged seems like it would be too much work.&nbsp; It would take a human worker a good 15-30 seconds per package and we all know how lazy the government is.&nbsp; They just want the perception of &quot;securing&quot;our international mail system without having to do much of the actual work.<br /><br />If it were a high-tech company I&#039;d say maybe they could use a camera the scans the address and inserts into a computer that cross-checks it against a blacklist but that wouldn&#039;t work well with multiple fonts and hand-written addresses.&nbsp; It&#039;d be nice if we had a customs guy on the forum somewhere but maybe there aren&#039;t that many out there?

				in the late 1990&#039;s I received a love letter from US Customs saying they had a package addressed to me and come to their local office where it was being held. Needless to say I stopped all my overseas dealings and deal IRL and on SR.<br /><br />i heard but have not confirmed they no longer send letters out. should your package have been small qty for personal use they might even follow up but destroy <br /><br />it would be be nice to confirm if letters are still sent &amp; what&#039;s now tracked your addy or your name

				From what I have seen and heard firsthand, that customs love letters and other notice of seizures, be it from the DEA or another LEO, very clearly state whom is sending you this correspondence and what authority they have by law to intercept your item in question. They are usually in a bigger legal sized envelope and not just a plain simple letter sized envelope and will be return addressed from somewhere like the DOJ or the US Attorney`s office from a particular state or district that sometime murky jurisdictional rules dictate. These letters also state at the end that you may respond to what they are basically accusing you of (but doing nothing in the form of legal sanctions) with one several responses. Contact information, in order to inquire or contest any seizure and alsovasking you if you wish to provide information about illegal activities to the authorities sending you the letter. If one received an empty package with a seizure letter, they should be immediately suspicious imo as there would likely be quite a delay between seizure of your shipment and the proper authorities producing you a love letter. Also there would be no harm imo, and no way I can see (not a lawyer) of incriminating yourself by simply calling any number they provide or sending a response via mail basically stating that you have no idea what this is about, and want to know why you are being accused of such a &quot;monstrosity.&quot; If your inquiries draw up blank responses at the authorities then you have a fake letter on your hands. Although the reason that a fake letter may work (to scare someone into burning the idea of ever receiving their shipment) is same reason that most people who would receive a letter would never consider contacting whomever intercepted it to ask about it, but imo I see nothing wrong with deny, deny, deny and be damn sure of what actually happened with my package, so I have better information in order to proceed with business as usual. Although it is a tough to say how to play a situation like that, as a lawyer has told me that if you don`t have anything good to say to the police then don`t show up and volunteer information and put yourself under the microscope, but not contesting something egregious can seem just as suspicious and be just as risky imo. I devolved into alot of speculation towards the end of this post, however overall I just feel like the fake seizure letter would be a tough scam to pull unless your recipient is a total dipshit due to all the things I described above.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think this question could be generated out of the posting on one of the largest O vendor&#039;s that states, &quot;..and tell us if you or your address has ever been red flagged, because we will find out anyway and you will be blacklisted..&quot; you can take away the quotes but this is pretty close to what it says. I am sure many of us into the O thing have read this and remember thinking, What the fuck does that mean? Do they have an inside source that is giving info? Which is what I kinda of think they are trying to lead us to believe. To give up any info of any problems we may have had or thought we had. Like the guilt of Mom telling you she knows what happened and you should just come clean with it, works with my kids haha. Just my opin..

The USPS has had optical character recognition reading the addresses on ALL mail since the 1970s... almost the entire world utilizes OCR for reading addresses now.
