				I used to be able to edit all of my feed back from rating to the comment. Now I can&#039;t what not? I just found out the bud I got was really under par and not worth the price. I left an initial 5 when it arrived. Now I need to change it but can&#039;t? wtf Is the new review system supposed to be like this?<br /><br /><br />EX:<br />What if someone received some pills and everything was fine at first, till some people got poisoned from the pills. They would obviously want and need ti change to a 1/5.

I believe buyers can delete the latest they&#039;ve given but cannot change. <br /><br />Waiting until sure of ratings/reviews is now the way to go. <br /><br />If at a later date you wish to change your opinion on the vendor/products, you can open a discussion on the vendors homepage and post here in the forums about it.

				So now we are supposed to receive the package, and either try it out then to determine what rating is appropriate, or put the transaction into resolution till you have a chance to do some drugs? I don&#039;t roll or trip all the time. I have acid from 2 months ago that I haven&#039;t gotten too yet.<br /><br />This new system needs the ability to update ratings.

				hi hi<br /><br />@electric paper:&nbsp; welcome back to civilization :)&nbsp; you must have been without Tor access to SR for a few weeks. there has been a big change in the way feedback is handled now.&nbsp; it&#039;s probably a wise idea for you to read what DPR has listed in the wiki regarding the changes made to the order/feedback process:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Ratings_%26_Reviews<br /><br />the short of it is this:&nbsp; you now receive goods and mark the order as finalized. this releases coins from escrow to the seller. at no point are you obligated to leave a review - written words or x/5 star rating. at any point after finalizing you may leave either or both an x/5 rating and written review. as you&#039;ve discovered, the written review once you leave it, is final. same goes for the star rating.<br /><br />also, regardless of what it says on the wiki for 4/5: many vendors still consider it a bit of an insult/slight if you rate them 4/5 for a happy successful transaction. it is still generally accepted that a vendor receiving a 4/5 screwed something up. so, it&#039;s advisable before leaving a 4/5 or below, you should message the vendor first and let them know, lest you risk them becoming unwilling to do further business with you....<br /><br />please note: in the previous system, you were never obligated to leave a rating and review at the time of finalization, it just wasnt &quot;advertised&quot; as the way to go. it was always kind of &quot;expected&quot; for buyers to leave a review upon finalization. the big change is now reviews are purposefully separated from finalizing, which simply releases coins.<br /><br /><br />i do not mean to sound rude here, but there are plenty of reagents that will let you know immediately without any physical ingestion whether or not the substance you received is what you were expecting. no need to guinea pig it in this day and age. no one is expecting you to roll face at work on a weekday afternoon :)<br /><br />as far as judging the quality of bud:&nbsp; there is no reagent for that (that i know of), so you may as well smoke a bowl at night if you dont yet have a discerning enough eye to tell the quality of the bud just by looks.&nbsp; here&#039;s a quick visual tip for bud quality: lots of stems/dry crumbly/flakey nugs = outdoor/greenhouse. super dense nugs with little to no stems/leaves = indoor.&nbsp; in both cases, you only want to see the actual calyxes and flowers. the little &quot;sugar leaves&quot; or anything resembling the iconic 5, 7, or 9 finger &quot;pot leaf&quot; is NOT what you want. that would indicate a bad trim job.&nbsp; also keep in mind, bud quality is all very very subjective. it&#039;s not like a pharmaceutical pill that is standardized and only produced by a specific lab etc. anyone can grow bud and therefore much of the grower&#039;s experience comes into play. not all bud is created equal... even the same strain from 2 growers can very well result in vastly different qualities.<br /><br />hope this helps!<br />xoxo<br />-mb

				The ability to change feedback really needs to be implemented. A lot of people who buy in bulk to resell often don&#039;t try their product and won&#039;t even have the chance to hear feedback about it for a few days sometimes even, sometimes even longer.... and it&#039;s simply rediculous to think of waiting to finalize until you try the product. <br /><br />Personally when I used to buy a lot of weed, I would finalize upon receiving since I would not get some privacy to weigh it out for several days sometime, and there has been instances when I got shorted a bunch and had to go back and change my feedback.

Feedback should be able to left immediately and updated periodically if anything changes in the experience with the drugs. Potential buyers need to hear about: vendors communication, stealth(was it good or bad), did all the drugs arrive, did it all appear good, etc. There are far too many variables that should be able to be updated and changed as they are found out about, instead of waiting until a month has passed since the transaction. <br /><br />I could go on. This is not Amazon.com Feedback should NOT be optional. It always bothered me that detailed feedbacks were not required. We are not dealing with professional corporations here, but clandestine individuals and groups selling illegal products that have likely not gone through lab-grade testing and are mostly meant to be put into a persons body. With this kind of stuff the importance of a detailed and easily updated feedback cannot be stressed enough.
