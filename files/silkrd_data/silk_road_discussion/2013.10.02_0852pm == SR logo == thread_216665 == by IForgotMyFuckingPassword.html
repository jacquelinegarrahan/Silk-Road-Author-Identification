				Someone else brought this shit to my attention: how many of you noticed that there&#039;s a giant image of the SR logo that looks something like a watermark on the seized by the Feds page (aka the main SR site)?<br /><br />That&#039;s really fucking weird!<br />

				If it wasn&#039;t for someone having actually been arrested in connection with this I would be wondering too, now I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s just some weird decision from a government employee.

				The background image is peculair, but that doesn&#039;t proof anything by itself. <br /><br />I can imagine the FBI IT department has spent quite some effort on this whole operation, and the IT people that work there may have a sense of humor just like those that work on any other project. Perhaps they just put the background in there without any official instruction to do so. <br /><br />As far as defending our islands and such goes: there is nothing in SR that cannot be reproduced, with security flaws fixed too. The only thing that is important is to retain the user base, its more or less a matter of moving to an island with a lot more hungry sharks around it :D

Its yours, its free, the way it should be. I&#039;m a synth head, and i did not like what i wrote.<br /><br />Popper was the only one defending DDW, so he is either DDW himself, or DDW&#039;s(Ron Pauls) bitch.
