				Did the SR staff remove the ability to go through a vendor&#039;s feedback history? Or is this an option a vendor can select? There used to be multiple pages to click through but now it seems as though one can only see the first page as the option to select other pages is not appearing anymore.

				We&#039;ve noticed this as well and dislike because as a new vendor we think it&#039;s detrimental that people can only see the last 10 or so of our transactions.

				Just an fyi, I typed &quot;/2&quot; after the URL on the vendor&#039;s page and the option to change the page popped up. Let me know if that works for you all as well.

I have seen this a couple times too, but it always came back. <br /><br />One thing it could be, when a listing runs out of available stock (which you can see listed next to the amount field in your shopping cart), and it goes to stealth then I think the feedback from that listing is stealthed as well.

Something is going on with Silk Road. My listings just went back up and they are not all appearing on my page, but they still appear in the &quot;cannabis&quot; section.<br />Also I updated my vendor page over 1 hour ago, saved it and it still hasn&#039;t changed.

				Yeah, I have noticed this as well. Appears to be a glitch, because every once in a while you can open random vendor pages and they still have feedback as normal (when you first open the page). However, if you refresh it goes back to just one page of feedback.

I know that they have to &quot;reload&quot; the SR from backups from time to time. And this issue may be a part of one of the boilerplate backups that they use. Hence why it comes and goes. Just my .2&nbsp; <br /><br />I do like being able to check out multiple pages of vendor reviews. It helps you deduce if a vendors stats are being held hostage when you see their ratings drop.
