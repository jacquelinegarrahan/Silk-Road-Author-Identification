				It would be nice if we could see our purchasing history by transaction for a longer period of time. I recently looked for a transaction in mid September and could not see it. You only have access to an abbreviated period of time. You need to look into &quot;feedback&quot; but that does not provide ample details.

				One thing that would help on the vendor reviews is to not take all 5 slots of history with &quot;FE&quot;.<br /><br />Would like to at least see 5 real comments from customers.<br /><br />
