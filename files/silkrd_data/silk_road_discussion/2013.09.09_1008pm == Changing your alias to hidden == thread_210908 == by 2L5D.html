				It&#039;s common sense to not let anyone know your alias on there, do not use an alias you use anywhere else, and do not use a real descriptive name.&nbsp; If your last name is wilson and you were born in 1990, do not put Wilson1990.<br />

The alias links together all reviews from a particular buyer, across any number of vendors, and allows anyone to see exactly what that buyer has bought, and when and from whom. <br /><br />Under the old system (until a month or so ago) that was not possible. And now, all of that information could be used as evidence in case of a busted buyer.<br /><br />That is why I have not written any reviews since these changes were made, despite having completed a couple of orders with two different vendors. (If those vendors are reading this, now you know why. And I suppose you&#039;ll have to take my word for it that I left you a 5/5 rating).<br /><br />Also I&#039;ve heard it said that the main (or only) reason for the inclusion of a pseudonym in reviews is so that we can tell when a vendor is padding his own feedback. But as convergedlight and others have said, there are other ways of achieving that without linking all reviews to a buyer. Some have been suggested already, and I have at least one other suggestion which I&#039;ll be posting shortly in the relevant thread.<br /><br />But for now, the only way to hide your alias is not to write any reviews.<br />
