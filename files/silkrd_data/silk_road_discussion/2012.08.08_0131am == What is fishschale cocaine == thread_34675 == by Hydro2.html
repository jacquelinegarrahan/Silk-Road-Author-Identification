				Fishscale Cocaine is Cocaine that has the pearlescent sheen on it, it can be a sign of quality but it&#039;s also not hard to replicate either so when you buy it it either tends to be great or a complete waste of fucking time lol. Another term that means the same thing is M.O.P which means Mother of Pearl. <br /><br />What is more advisable to look for when buying Rip is tacky product, not squidgy like Amphetamine base but tacky flakes that stick together. That&#039;s what you should generally look for when buying it. <br /><br />Hope this helps. :)

So if you have a tacky product it&#039;s by-and-large not been washed and it&#039;s straight of the brick. However if the product has been washed with acetone it will be purer than if it&#039;s been cut of the brick (if done correctly) but it could be quite hard. Also if the cocaine was overly HCLd when making the salt from the base then it can be really really rocky and hard to cut. I remember buying some from Dutchaanbod on here I think the second or third time I bought from him and it was really hard, was fucking amazing stuff though.

It explains how to acetone wash and how to test for shit with Clorox.
