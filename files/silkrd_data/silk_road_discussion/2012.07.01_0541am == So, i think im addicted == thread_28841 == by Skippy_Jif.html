				To SR. Seriously, I have literally been on the site/board all the time ever since I&#039;ve registered a vendor acct. The system is perfect, pretty damn close though, but I really enjoy it. Far more than any other board I&#039;ve been a part of.<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually considered getting my first tattoo(never knew what I wanted) with my insignia/user name/SR. I love this site and the level of intelligence here. Yes there are moronic kids, but there are some highly smart intellectuals that enjoy talking/telling jokes to and reading their posts.<br /><br />Thanks SR Community! &lt;3

				Yeah, I do love the community here.&nbsp; Just ignore the kids and other ungrateful individuals, and you&#039;re left with a great group of people anonymously sharing the same ideal.<br /><br />I hope it lasts forever, but even if it doesn&#039;t, I will always remember SR as a major success in pretty much every aspect.

Currently running a proxy server.<br /><br />Please consider that I am joking if it sounds like one guys. I really would hate to jeopardize my business because of joke based on stupidity.

				OP just be sure to&nbsp; tattoo your 4 digit pin on your forehead&nbsp; too ok?&nbsp; Just so we can all really&nbsp; admire&nbsp; it for what it is haha.<br /><br /><br />All jokes aside buddy&nbsp; we are glad you are here and enjoying SR and able to stay safe and enjoy the freedom god has given to us all by birth.&nbsp; Just please do not do the tat. Buy you a shirt maybe? I spend a lot of time here too as most of&nbsp; the people here are really good people and it is enjoyable chatting with them. It is a shame the LEO;s could not just see us for who we really are for just a few minutes&nbsp; and see we are not&nbsp; criminals and bad people. Most of us anyways.<br /><br />That aside my friend have fun and&nbsp; stay safe.
