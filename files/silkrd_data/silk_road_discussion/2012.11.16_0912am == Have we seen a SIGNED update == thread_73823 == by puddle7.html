				Sorry, lost amongst the spam, I was looking for a SIGNED update from DPR saying all is well.&nbsp; Sure, the site is up, but do we have an update, GPG signed, from DPR saying it&#039;s all good?

				I agree with you on this. Was looking for any authenticated update from the (wo)man myself.<br />Would be nice though and instantly cure a lot of paranoia around here.

				A good point was made that LE likes to take things down for about a week then ensnare ppl.&nbsp; Everyone keep to GPG of all messages - especially addresses.&nbsp; Always assume the site is compromised, and act accordingly.

				if this is a security problem for anyone then guess what, your security fucking sucks. at no point do you need to trust DPR or silk road to keep your anonymity intact. <br /><br />money is, of course, another issue.
