				BTC dropped hard last week and it is getting much harder to acquire the currency so alot of vendors are experiencing reduced business... Rates also went up to become a vendor and transaction fees went up (but only for &gt;$1000).&nbsp; Alot has been happening recently&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; I expect tweed prices to drop in september when the huge summer grows start rolling out onto the market.

				IMO this is whats going on and Im sure than anyone that knows anything much about the stock market NYSE can and will vouch for me on this one.<br /><br />Lack of resources for BTC and so many people want things and so many new people following?&nbsp; raise prices, the government did.<br /><br />So much high end security needed just to be able to provide a service like this, again another reason why<br /><br />Teenagers and stupid little fucks that want to get high so badly, another reason

				The comission charges changed recently, though, weed prices are all over the place on the road because there are so many varieties in quality. Sure you might be able to get an ounce from 1 guy for 200 and an ounce from another guy for 350, but you can be rest fucking assured the quality is going to be reflected in the price. It is very easy to take deceptive pictures, especially of weed, to make it look better than it is. The range of qualities is enormous. <br />

				Yeah, I dunno about these days, but good quality weed where I am, 10 years ago, was between £120-£160 for an ounce, so there wasn&#039;t much profit to be had from it at street level. Some of the prices for it on SR, make my head spin, but I guess vendors are here to make a profit, and the prices reflect that. :(

				I&#039;ve watched one particular sellers 7g go from ~$85 to ~$130 in the space of a year. Also in that time BTC has gone from about $8 to around $100 atm. Seriously though a fiftho should really not cost almost double even including overheads of postage and fees etc.

				I raised my prices recently because Btc are expensive to turn into cash safely and after buyers make a purchase, they often drop in value before I can ship and then some more before it arrives and gets finalized and some more before I can convert them to dollars.<br />Also, this time of year is festival/camping season. Days are longer and people smoke a lot more weed in Summer. At the same time, the supply of fresh outdoor and greenhouse weed in the Northern Hemisphere has been nearly cut-off due to the seasonality of weed growing. It takes a lot of work or expense/tech to get plants to produce buds this time of year. Most outdoor/greenhouse growers still have their crops in vegetative mode this time of year. Indoor growers often have to use expensive air conditioning to do well indoors when it is easy to grow outside instead. <br />I was not here to see SR prices last summer. Even in the land of plenty, supplies usually dry up during August. I am already seeing my suppliers raising prices and I would not be surprised to see SR weed prices double before the outdoor crops start coming in. I am curious what it was like last August here?
