He just said that he could not be bothered with the paperwork, &quot;have a nice day kid, thanks 4 the $20&quot;. <br /><br />Most cops are kool-aid man! Just always tell the truth though.

				MAn FUCK the police! yes on certain occasions they will indeed let you ride, on lots of shit, but then when one finds his wifes fucking the captain, he decides to be the biggest dick a LE badge has ever seen, moral is that no one man should be able to have the right or power to decide what will or wont happen to a person breaking any laws, the law is the law, and no one is above it (echemm, NYPD) <br /><br />&nbsp;Like duckman said, grow the fuck up, and grow some balls, dude, im 150lb soaking wet, yes im fucking shredded and have elephantitus of the balls, LOL, but ive bitched slapped the hardest of the hard, infront of their entire &#039;crews&#039;.. the point im trying to make here, is if you mind your own fucking business, give respect where its due, and be a fucking man, you will rarely find your self in these predicaments.. then when the occasion presents it self that a person(s) dis respect you as a man, or your strictly acting out of self defense and survial, 10 out of 10 times, you will be the victor.. unless of coarse your just a bitch LOL<br /><br />If your about your business, show respect where it is due, fear no man &amp; fear only god.. no one will ever cross the line with you.
