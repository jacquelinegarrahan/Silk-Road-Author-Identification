			<dd class="postbody">
				I recently ordered some pills from a very established connection on Silk Road. When I got the pills I saw Chinese writing on them. I was shocked too say the least. The Chinese have been producing all kinds of products that kill people and animals for years. I believe that any Silk Road seller who does sell Chinese drugs has an obligation too tell the customer up front. Chinese drugs maybe cheap but the Chinese have a proven track record for poor drugs and dangerous products.<br /><br />I believe that no respectable vendor would sell any Chinese drugs because its just too dangerous. Each time we put something into our body from China we are taking a big risk. I ask any vendor who does sell Chinese products too please put it in your profile or your listing. I know some will hesitate because this will result in lost sales but money isnt as important as safety. Its not worth saving $100 on 50 pills to buy Chinese when there is good Canadian and European products. <br /><br />If it was up too me America would put an embargo on Chinese goods because its clear that the Chinese put more value on profit than life animal or human.

				i order tons of stuff from china.. chemicals and precursors.. they have a lot of state of the art pharm companies there.. heck 99% if all research chemicals come from china.. and steroids and a shit load of stuff.<br /><br />though.. i agree with pills that you did not source your own self..&nbsp; and there are a shit load of pharm companies that are shady and back door.

Life is cheap in china. <br />but I am afraid that it will be china laying down the embargo on USA. Everyone knows the US have a very limited life span. USA will just be another Russia in a few years, also because they put profit before life. <br />Personally I prefer sweet and sour pork over maccas. That is why I think Aus should be supplying China with more plutonium than the USA...at least China are not warmongers...they generally stick to themselves.<br />Sorry got a bit off track....but yeah..china makes excellent chemicals but they kill bears milking bile to feed their placebo, so fuck em.. boycott china made:)

				Take a look around you and try to find something not made in China. As the Chinese gain human rights and democracy, those new LED TVs are gonna become a lot more expensive.<br /><br />As far as quality of their goods, well I buy chemicals from China and they are always much higher purity and better quality than U.S. chemicals, at 1/10th the cost. The countries I avoid buying from are India, Pakistan, and basically any middle eastern country. Pakistanis especially are notorious for lying and scamming.

				I dont call 911. Im just trying too be helpful. Your post wasnt very helpful. Chinese drugs are dangerous and I dont want too hear that anyone gets hurt or sick because of low quality Chinese drugs.

				Anytime we put any drug in our body that wasn&#039;t made in a government-inspected lab we&#039;re putting our lives at risk. That&#039;s the life that we have chosen. I do see the point you&#039;re trying to make.<br /><br />So....what happened to the pills?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				They were morphine and I just threw them away. THey had chinese writing directly on them. I didnt wanan leave bad feedback because the seller did everything they said it was my fault that I didnt like the drug because it was chinese. So I just took a lose. But this vendor is a respected member of the community and thier other products I have recieved were high quality.<br /><br />I agree anytime we put a drug in our body its a risk but the Chinese seem too constantly produce products that lead too death.
