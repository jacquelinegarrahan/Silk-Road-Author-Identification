				I notice vendors have all these very pretty pictures of their products.<br />Unfortunately what is delivered doesn&#039;t look anything at all like what&#039;s in the pictures.<br /><br />It&#039;s clearly false advertising.<br /><br />It&#039;s mostly to do with weed MDMA and cocaine and hash and heroin.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure vendors are just too lazy to update the pictures when they get new product.<br /><br />Just the other day I ordered some MDMA in the picture showed it was tan colored sand type Which is what I wanted.&nbsp; But what was delivered was a white powder.&nbsp; And it had no effect I consumed 500 mg of MDMA in one dose.&nbsp; This should&#039;ve been downright lethal dose.<br /><br />Is there anyway we can enforce the product pictures to resemble the actual product?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Short answer is a lot of times the same picture stays up but batches change...<br />A lot of times your product has to be broken down for shipping, eg; MDMA<br />And sometimes you&#039;re just a victim of the classic bait and switch, not much you can do.<br />

				That&#039;s a good post.&nbsp; But I think it&#039;s not too hard to snap a photograph.&nbsp; I work in marketing so I think pictures are everything they should be updating those all the time.&nbsp; I would love to be the guy who designs the pictures for the vendors.&nbsp; They need some graphic designers to spruce up the photographs a bit and throw some text in there and make it look real nice.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If any vendors are reading message me on the graphic designer I can design you some really nice product pictures.&nbsp; I guarantee an increase in sales based on the pictures alone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sadly the MDMA was from one of the biggest vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;I won&#039;t say his name.&nbsp; My best guess is that one of his employees must be ripping him off They are taking the good stuff and replacing it with some inert white powder. It seems to be only things that are resembling white powder That is vendor seems to have troubles with.

				Another example and again I won&#039;t use any names - I bought some hash that was pictured as Moroccan.&nbsp; What was delivered look nothing out all like the picture.&nbsp; And it certainly wasn&#039;t Moroccan.&nbsp; I mean it was good but it wasn&#039;t Moroccan.&nbsp; Course I should&#039;ve known better because the price was too good to be Moroccan.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vendors that show Crystal meth shards.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had those big shards&nbsp; in the pictures.&nbsp; I always get the powder and the little bits and cloudy looking crystals.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#039;t come off as a complainer.&nbsp; We are truly blessed for this resource that is silk Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again I would love to design the product pictures for the vendors.&nbsp; Something snazzy and high-resolution type photographs.&nbsp;

				False advertising? If you get good gear, does it really matter? Once it is of high quality and it is the drug I paid for, I don&#039;t care. Besides, it&#039;s not like you can go to the advertising standards authority and make a complaint. It is an underground market ;) <br /><br />The TOR network can be slow, batches of product change, vendors can be extremely busy, they may have loads of messages to answer etc - these are just some of the reasons that pictures may not get updated. Anything I have received has looked fairly similar to the pictures to be honest.

Hehe<br /><br />I really like looking at all those pictures of products.&nbsp; Shit I even masturbate to those great pictures!<br />Does anybody else here masturbate to drug porn on SR?<br />I don&#039;t even check a real porn anymore I just look at the pretty pictures on silk Road and beat off to that.<br /><br />So you can see why I am gung ho about the pictures.

				Ahh those classic face shots on social networking sites very skinny looking, but they&#039;re pictured full body on a night out.. SHES MASSIVE!!!! Not that I judge or nothing&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Product pictures are tricky especially for MDMA, cocaine and meth listings, users need to bare in mind most of these products need to be crushed slightly or even completely in order for them to arrive safely.. what use is it a vendor sending a 5g moonrock when customs could easily intercept it after feeling something suspicious, as opposed to 5g crushed that that could fit into a business styled envelope?<br /><br />Think people, think! But I do agree some standard should be maintained to show roughly. If pictures can&#039;t be updated, at least update the listing description

				I personally think that if someone cheats you in any way, you SHOULD mention a name.&nbsp; &nbsp;I see a lot where people say that they won&#039;t say who did it.&nbsp; &nbsp;But honestly if you don&#039;t then why would the vendor ever change?&nbsp; Why not just keep doing it?&nbsp; &nbsp;You know?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;It isn&#039;t unheard of for vendors to have great feedback and be honest, then one day scam the hell out of a lot of people and disappear.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who knows maybe if more people did report that kind of thing and made it known, it could stop something like that from happening.

				Think about the pictures used in advertisements for fast food burgers vs. what actually gets served. Also, have you not noticed that the same picture will correspond to a dozen different listings? I think it&#039;s best to regard the pictures on SR as a &quot;general idea of what your product might look like in an ideal world&quot; and not read too much more into it than that.

				We always either have current pics or let people know that new pics are on their way,&nbsp; &amp; rarely let it go for more than a week before we get updated.&nbsp; However it is a little bit of work to keep everything for the site current as well as running everything else at optimal capacity sometimes.&nbsp; Most vendors will let web pics slide a bit to try to get orders out as timely as possible, &amp; updating pics often get left on the back burner.&nbsp; You have to realize that&nbsp; getting everything ready for keeping web pages up &amp; current are not necessarily most venders specialty!&nbsp; IT&#039;s just one of the many hats they have to wear to be productive.<br /><br />NCK
