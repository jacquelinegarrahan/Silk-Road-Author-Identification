				<br />Not proud of this but my stupidity has cost me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve forgotten my SR password, forgotten my SR Forum password twice and the best part is that I have no idea what my Bitcoin passphrase is.&nbsp; I know Bitcoin says that if you lose your passphrase you&#039;re fucked but is there anyway to go into your computer and find the passphrase?<br /><br />Artist Formerly Known On This Forum as<br />tcobambient and tcobambient1<br /><br />Lesson to learned.&nbsp; Don&#039;t count on your brain to remember passwords.&nbsp; Write that shit down!!<br /><br />So within a week, I&#039;ve gotten phished and lost money by someone else and then I lost my passphrase and lost my own money.&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;m fucking retarded.<br /><br />&nbsp;::)

				Thanks.&nbsp; And the weird thing is I&#039;ve forgotten passwords to a bunch of sites.&nbsp; Sites that I was just on yesterday afternoon and then last night it&#039;s like they were wiped from my memory.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not drug related.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done any drugs in a while.&nbsp;

				I really don&#039;t know what happened.&nbsp; It&#039;s like someone wiped my memory.&nbsp; I was logged in fine yesterday and then last night I forgot passwords to not just these sites but a bunch of others.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s stress related.&nbsp; Those fucking bitcoins would have come in handy to buy a little weed.&nbsp;

				Yup, I&#039;ve learned the hard way, to use keepass...well, actually, I now use keepassx, because I can use it on any platform...I know now they have keepass2, but anyway, I&#039;m rambling...&nbsp; and I save a a kdb file online in a storage site: I recommend SwissDisk.com, but there are others, probably better...very&nbsp; easy to stash the databases in a file anywhere, flash drive, piece of paper tacked to the wall, u name it...<br /><br />In keepassx you can keep all this vital info in one spot, plus you can use, and have them create, totally tough passwords, no more dog&#039;s name, and mom&#039;s birthday and that kind of crap....<br /><br />So as soon as I boot up Tails, and get the updates and a couple apps, I can shoot over and get my keypass file, which has everything I need...it&#039;s the only way to go, as it&#039;s a bummer to go thru what you wen thru, and not be able to get back in...

				Considering how many bitcoins are allowed to ever be in circulation, I wonder howmany bitcoins will end up like this. Forever stuck in an account with no way to access them.
