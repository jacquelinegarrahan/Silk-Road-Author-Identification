				Don Corleone is back with a new sellers account that will be up soon. Check some of my threads to learn about my products because they are not posted yet. My SR account is DonCorleone133. Every other buyer will get an extra 20% for a limited time! Trusted buyers will get free samples when i get new batches (like always). Will be up soon with products. Till then talk to me on the road if u want to talk business. Just be nice with reviews I never had a problem with a client i couldn&#039;t work out. -Thanks

				I would also like to remind people who haven&#039;t dealt with me before your address will never be compromised! I have a guy come over every week and clean my hard drive and everything. So even if I get caught in the future it shouldn&#039;t come back on you. With other vendors you may be risking your safety even AFTER you receive the drugs! Keep that in mind people. If anybody would like any help please contact me on the road- Corleone133

Feel free to treat anything negative I say about you at this juncture as conjecture and paranoia, by the way. That&#039;s all it is, after all.

I did nothing wrong and your spamming my shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry, what business? There isn&#039;t a business here.<br /><br />Fuck off until you have a business and stop spamming the boards with your bullshit. No account, no business, no one is spamming your shit, and you&#039;re not running anything by a hype-train.<br /><br />Given the recent scam that just ended, I&#039;m actually more likely to think that you are a scammer just the same, hiding behind a name that was at one time well-received. Given that there is no more DonCorleone selling... why is that? Why would a legitimate vendor lose their vending privileges and be unable to get them back? Unless they had been scamming...
