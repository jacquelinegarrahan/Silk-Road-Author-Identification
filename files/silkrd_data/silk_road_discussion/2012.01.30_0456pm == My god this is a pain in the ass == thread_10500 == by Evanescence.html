				Yeah there&#039;s a big learning curve, but someone could make some really nice and clear infographic about how to use the place, full of &quot;best practices.&quot; Distill it down to the essence.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure vendors would appreciate more buyers. Although the current ratio of vendors to users is about 1:555.<br /><br />However, the problem is in determining how many of a vendor&#039;s past transactions were from shills. What is stopping any given vendor from registering tons of buyer accounts and buying crap from himself? How does any other buyer know that feedback is from a real, unique person?

But of course, that ship has sailed long ago, what with the Gawker articles and all that. Even Wikipedia has direct links to SR, the forum and the wiki.

				The barrier to entry for shill buyers is as easy as entering a username and password. So you can&#039;t trust that vendor feedback is legitimate.<br /><br />The barrier to entry for vendors is higher, it requires $150 and some knowhow, but any scammer could use those easily obtained shill buyer accounts to prop themselves or their associates up. You can&#039;t have a reliable web of trust when it&#039;s difficult or impossible to tell if two accounts are the same person or not.<br /><br />And there&#039;s really no incentive for the site to stop scammers, since the site gets a cut of every transaction. A transaction where a buyer is scammed out of $100 is worth as much to the site as a transaction where a buyer actually receives their $100 worth of goods.

However that may not be a bad thing. If SR gets too well known and too popular, it&#039;s bound to attract more attention from LE and probably serious efforts by them to infiltrate the marketplace. The biggest fear is some LE pose as sellers and bust a load of unsuspecting buyers. I think that is a real danger and it would shake the confidence of the marketplace and severely restrict the number of vendors buyers would be willing to deal with.<br /><br />I think SR has it about right at present for buyers... I don&#039;t know what checks they carry out on sellers, but perhaps this needs to be more thorough or clever, to make sure LE don&#039;t setup as honey pot vendors and trap buyers.<br />&nbsp;<br />SR will spread by word of mouth and those buyers who are technophobes or can&#039;t understand TOR/bitcoins can always learn from a friend if they can&#039;t access the forum.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
