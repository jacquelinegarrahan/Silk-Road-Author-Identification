				That sounds pretty bold, I wouldn&#039;t do it but then again that&#039;s just me. I&#039;ve never been into this kind of thing but I&#039;m pretty sure the value of the coin won&#039;t be going down anytime soon but who knows how much more value it will gain over the time. I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s still possible to gain more value, hell some people said it would reach $100 a while ago, I was hesitant about investing then and at that time it was only about $40 per coin so who knows man.

				Flip a coin.<br /><br />It&#039;s called speculation for a reason, but I don&#039;t see any real threats to the BTC in the coming years.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a lot invested in them.&nbsp; Go for it (that is, if you don&#039;t need a car).

				That&#039;s quite a gamble there but the payoff could be huge if you guess right. Guess wrong and you can loose your ride. But if you have any cash it just might be worth playing the bit coin market with. <br /><br />Never gamble what you can&#039;t afford to loose but thats just my opinion.

				Remember when back in 2012 it dropped from $30 or $40 a bitcoin down to a measly $2.00 ?<br />Its very possible that bitcoins high prices are here to stay and that theyll keep goin up, but its also possible this is a bubble due to everyone hoarding bitcoins and it might crash soon..<br />Proceed with caution

				first question you must ask yourself: can you afford it?<br /><br />If you end up losing all the money that was invested into BTC, could you go on with your life without that money? Or will you have to work overtime with your asshole boss that won&#039;t leave you alone for the next couple years until you can afford your car again?

Maybe take out a loan if you have the credit so if it does tank, which I doubt, you would at least be able to pay it back slowly or claim bankruptcy is you&#039;re about to lose your credit anyway. But I remember something about having to pay that back eventually. Maybe asking a tax attorney would be better or financial planner if you have access.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you but without a car i&#039;m up shits creek

				When i am thinking about to selling my car or not, bitcoin rises 50$ MORE at the same time(12 hours) ! so it is 150$rightnow, now thats seems dangerous. this is way too much, i will put reasonably money for coins today but car thing can wait for a while..<br />if you guys can buy and sell all you got in 1 week i suggest to you guys do the same. put some money in it.

				Buy low sell high. Thats how you win the stock market.<br />I would be very wary about investing in BTCs atm, only a small percentage of them are in circulation, the majority are being hoarded, anyone who invested in BTCs this time last year will be selling them off very soon and this&#039;ll flood the market.<br />You&#039;d be amazed how quickly they can fall, if people lose confidence in them as an investment they will plummet as no one&#039;ll be buying.<br /><br />I think they&#039;ll be under $60 within the month then start climbing again.

				I was going to suggest &quot;possibly not&quot;, then I opened my mouth a very long time when I opened Mt Gox. You&#039;re kidding right? A few hours ago 1 bitcoin was trading weighted average of £82.00, now it is £55.98. <br /><br />Anyone taking predictions on how low it will go before coming back up?<br /><br />But no, don&#039;t sell your car if you can&#039;t afford to. By the time you sell it it will be up to £130 again lol. ::)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
