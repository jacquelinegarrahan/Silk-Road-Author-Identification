				Thank you very much.<br />It seems to be very plausible.<br />As long as a vendor is not established, nobody would buy more than a sample from him. And only when his legitimacy is proven an he sells real gear, people will start to buy bulk.<br />But all that would only make sense if LE wasn&#039;t allowed to sell REAL drugs. I don&#039;t know but have slightly in mind that LE is not allowed to commit any crimes.

				This is an issue i was going to address in another thread but i might as well address it here.<br /><br />Its impossible for LE to bust multiple buyers for one simple reason.<br /><br />An LE can buy drugs, an LE can even do drugs but there is one thing they cannot do.<br /><br />A LEO cannot let drugs go by it, by that i mean if you give LE weed and you tell them to give it back to you they cannot unless they were to bust you right there!!<br />So LEO cannot sell drugs to multiple vendors and then bust them days,weeks, or months later because they cannot let the drugs they sold get back into the system.<br /><br />Theoreticly it is possible for a LEO to sell drugs to a SR buyer, and bust them and stop selling on SR.&nbsp; But the resources to do this is too much to create single vendor accounts to bust one buyers unless it is a big buy.&nbsp; <br /><br />From what i gather the only time you have to worry about getting setup by an LEO on a buy is if a LE create fake buys and fake feedback and then busting you.&nbsp; <br /><br />In conclusion it is near impossible to get setup on a SR buy, and one last thing they are not going after buyers but sellers and we all know busting sellers is near impossible.

				there is nothing to stop LE from doing it, however a few things that may stop them, is finances - is this gonna net some big time players and be worth the cash? probably not a few middle class kids buying mdma is hardly going to be worth police funds.&nbsp; Risks, ok say they deem it prudent to honeypot, they will want to have whoever is buying bang to rights, so they will probably do a few sales, but they will want to take into account the risks, what if the product they sell gets into wider circulation? what if some of the heroin goes missing? i mean it would look pretty bad if LE sold 500g of heroin and some 16 year old girl ended up dead... however there is really nothing &quot;if they deem it worthwhile&quot; to stop them, probably figure they could catch a few big players if they sold enough mdma. <br /><br />a few misconceptions on LE, they do set up honeypot&#039;s all the time, i was watching some show where they rented out farmland for mexican drug gangs to grow bud on, then swooped in and got them after months... they can hand drugs back, this is the most obvious thing ever, imagine a cop is undercover on a big drug bust, some dude says hold this for a minute, comes back expecting the package, the cops like oh i cant mate im a cop cant give this back... he would be shot and ruin a major bust... Also another falsehood is if you ask a cop if they are a cop, they have to tell you, this is not true either so dont think your covering your arse when asking a vendor that.

				Another thing to keep in mind is perspective. Silk Road is terrible from a PR perspective for the war on drugs when some middle class naive family type reads Silk Road headlines in the news. It sounds terrible to them...an Amazon.com of drugs? Silk Road has really grown and there is significant activity and transactions here but in the grand scheme of drug transactions it&#039;s still just a drop in the bucket and LE already are so hard pressed to handle the war on drugs before this anonymous clearing house was a large scale operation. Sure some fairly big fish can probably be netted here and from there...maybe trace their chain back and roll that vendor up to their seller and try to get a big player but that&#039;s no different than what law enforcement currently does in real life.<br /><br />It&#039;s even less effective with silk road though since it&#039;s truly anonymous. Bust a large scale buyer using your honey pot vendor and he probably can&#039;t even roll because he has almost no information and the information he may have requires so many resources and time to track down it comes back to the &quot;worth it&quot;. I mean if you&#039;re really doing major work here...alright but still for every big vendor here there are hundreds doing it the old fashioned way still that represent a much larger percentage of the total war on drugs.<br /><br />SilkRoad is bad PR but it&#039;s still a smaller part of the overall system. Unlikely you bust a seller here and trace him back to a cartel or extremely high level source. Sure most high level sources are sufficiently insulated and protected and if you&#039;re really a big fish (from LE&#039;s POV) is it worth doing business here if you already have a thriving empire?<br /><br />Also if they invest so much time and money here...that&#039;s less resources to attack traditional drug shipment routes and ultimately LE&#039;s resources are limited and vastly overwhelmed. Some people fall inevitably, there will be blood, but the battle of attrition that is the war on drugs continues and this is a game changer along with bit coins.<br /><br />Maybe ultimately SR leads to reasonable reform of drug laws in many places (like the US) because this is just the natural evolution of technology and our global world/marketplace and it won&#039;t be stopped. It&#039;s far too late now.

				Wokker the fast and furious deal is a mess cause they never tracked the weapons!!<br />they never intended to track them - they intended to use the excuse of guns running to mexican <br />cartells to further erode our 2nd amendment rights - That is all.<br />If LE had their grubby little dick feelers into the road it would be monumentally: fucked up, <br />incompetent and way more unsafe than it is.

				Oh, I guess I misunderstood their goal for the whole thing. <br /><br />edit: I did a little more reading on it, and it seems the ATF really had the intentions of tracking and controlling the weapons.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s a conspiracy, or whatever you&#039;re insinuating, but a genuine bumble by a federal agency. They mainly fucked up because they allowed way too many &quot;controlled&quot; sales.&nbsp; <br /><br />*clearnet* http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/10/earlyshow/main20070475.shtml<br /><br />According to the article, if possible, a few weapons were fitted with an electronic tracker.&nbsp; Also, the only way that the weapons were tied to crime scenes were the serial numbers, which had to have been recorded.&nbsp; That goes to show they had accounted for each item, but just lost control of it&#039;s movement.&nbsp; If anything it&#039;s just a testament to the fact that LE can and will fuck up.

				Just one thing that I don&#039;t think was pointed out above, remember that different jurisdictions may have different rules for their LE. I don&#039;t claim to be an expert on this at all, but if I was worried about the realistic possibility of a honeypot operation I would be doing a lot of research into the laws/rules/regulations both in my area and the area I&#039;m ordering from.<br /><br />One example of this, I believe there is a defence of entrapment available to people in the US (under specific circumstances...), but I know for a fact this won&#039;t work in my country. People picking up all their info from popular media may not realise this though...

				once in my stupider days, i got drunk and ordered a stungun and pepper spray and thermite through ebay, the thermite had a caution on it, and the stungun was confiscated, the pepperspray came through without issue, the police never contacted me about any of theese items, which is odd, because EVERYTHING pointed to me buying theese items, even the debit card...<br /><br />&nbsp;but still i wouldnt worry about buying from a cop or honeypot, because they cant exactly bust you for recieving items just say not mine officer some pillock keeps sending me drugs and i have no idea why!! i mean if the law prosecuted you for recieving illegal things, then all of the unabombers victims would be liable due to recieving explosives.<br /><br />note: it has only become clear to me now what a fucking silly prick i was at a younger age... damn.<br />

				The thing is if LE&#039;s pull something like a fast and furious also and some kid overdoses etc it could potentially blow up in their face.<br /><br />Fast and Furious was basically just a political shitstorm although really blown out of proportion but a good reminder to LE that they take risk if they use controversial tactics.<br /><br />So you come back to...is it worth it? Not really to bust a bunch of random buyers...at best a scare tactic really.<br /><br />I think they are making controlled buys and have fake personas setup in the forums as we speak but probably at a low level. I could under estimate LE but it takes them years typically to gather any meaningful info through controlled buys in cases like this and if a vendor uses good safety/anonymity protocol even then they may not gain much info.<br /><br />Also - you don&#039;t have to ship stuff to your house. Even if you do you can deny it, but there are safety steps that go beyond that where they&#039;d have to really do a controlled delivery and even then it&#039;s not a guaranteed bust. If you&#039;re buying any kind of weight I&#039;d imagine you&#039;re already using these safety protocol.<br /><br />Fuck the cops. Freedom for all.

				http://www.erowid.org/freedom/police/police_info6.shtml<br /><br />Are Police Allowed to Break The Law?<br />Police officers working undercover have exceptions from certain criminal laws. For instance, law enforcement officers directly engaged in the enforcement of controlled substance laws are exempt from laws surrounding the purchase, possession, sales or use of illegal substances.7 <br /><br />This means that there&#039;s no way to identify an undercover officer based on their willingness or refusal to use an illegal drug. Reverse stings are common in the enforcement of controlled substance laws. In a reverse sting operation, a police officer sells drugs that have previously been confiscated and then arrest the buyer.

				One thing I don&#039;t understand is how can LE get anything better than possession on you... I mean, even if they get your address, they have to stalk your house until you get the drugs, and then they have to arrest you after you&#039;ve opened the envelope. Unless you open the envelope, there is no proof that you knew there were drugs in it... I mean, as far as you&#039;re concerned, you got an envelope in the mail, for someone other than yourself, and you didn&#039;t know what to do with it, certainly not that there are drugs in it.<br /><br />Even if the envelope is in your name, that doesn&#039;t prove anything since anyone can send you drugs w/ your name on the envelope. That&#039;s a classic setup.<br /><br />The only moment where they can arrest you is after you&#039;ve opened the envelope. And even then, it would only be for possession... Not a big prize. If you&#039;re a normal person (that has had no connection w/ LE and no record), then the judge will almost definitely let you off with a warning... (At least where I come from)<br /><br />Now remember that this is a huge effort. Stake outs and waiting for the right moment for you to open the envelope. Think how much money this whole operation can cost. Not to mention that the only one that can do this kind of thing is the FBI, since there is no chance it would be in the same jurisdiction of local police, and the FBI isn&#039;t interested in low-level users (I don&#039;t think they even care about local high level drug lords).<br /><br />This kind of mess sounds very hard to me.<br /><br />However, you have to be aware that there was already an arrest of an SR member done in australia this month or the previous one (if I&#039;m not mistaken). My guess is that they caught him at customs somehow. I don&#039;t see any other way.<br /><br />They are claiming that they are going to make more SR based arrests, which is something to keep in mind. However, don&#039;t forget that LE is in the habit of lying, and that it is virtually powerless without relying on intimidation... If everyone started buying and selling drugs then LE can&#039;t do anything about it.<br />So I wouldn&#039;t take these statements too seriously. I think that&#039;s the reason the drug war doesn&#039;t succeed and never will... <br /><br />But if we want to be really pessimstic, then let&#039;s say they do make arrests. I don&#039;t see them making more than 10 (there is a limit to the amount of people you can/want to lock up) arrests. Making these arrests would take at the very least a year, since drug enforcement is not very good with technology. So if you get 10 busts per year, and there are 10000 members here, then that leaves us with a chance of 1/1000 of being arrested in a year.<br /><br />Another interesting point is that LE doesn&#039;t want people who are regular citizens in jail. That has a double cost of financing the prisoner, and the loss of the guy&#039;s salary... Not very attractive to anyone with half a mind, especially during an economic crisis.<br /><br />And let&#039;s not even mention international drug purchases, which probably make cooperation impossible.

				I&#039;m lucky that I live in a state that possessing or buying weed is decriminalized and it has been since the late 70&#039;s.I&#039;m not talking about selling only possessing.If you possess under 100 grams for personal use (no intent to sell,they cant be in separate baggies,you cant have a scale on you,ect...) then it doesn&#039;t even go on your criminal record.For 100g or less for personal use there is no incarceration just a $150 fine its pretty much like a traffic ticket and its handled like one.In fact in my state they are extremely lenient about organic marijuana but you get FUCKED if its like fake shit like spice or K2.All the lenience doesn&#039;t carry over into distributing large amounts or having over 100 grams.Even though if you sell less than 20 grams or if you give it as a gift its also treated like a traffic ticket with a decently large fine (not over $500) and no jail time.BUT if you sell it to a minor they treat it worse than if you sold 20,000+ grams to an adult and its a felony of the 1st degree with a minimum sentence of 7 years.They are extremelyyy lenient as long as you aren&#039;t selling pounds or if you&#039;re not selling it to kids or in school zones.So I cant really complain to much about my local laws.And it would be pointless and useless for them to bust me for buying personal weed because they wouldn&#039;t get anything but a few hundred dollars from me.There is a flip side to that though.They are lenient about weed but if you have something other than weed like meth for example or there new crusades are on the fake shit like jwh and shit then you are FUCKED! We have decriminalized marijuana laws but every other drug is stricter than most states.So it would be pointless for them to bust me I would just be kind of irritated and it would be a waste a lot time and money for both of us.

				Yah, it was true it was an autobiography by the under cover officer for the ATF. <br /><br />See you live in the Netherlands and don&#039;t even know anything about American government, because if you did you would know they break the law all the time. They are the government and will do what they want no matter what. Worst that happens is some low level officials get demoted or abscence with pay while the higher ups who ordered it just sit there. There are so many known examples of the government/law enforcement blatantly breaking the law and admitting to it later. If you want to live in a fantasy land and pretend this doesn&#039;t happen on a daily basis then go ahead. <br /><br />Look up: <br />CIA Contra<br />Afghan Freedom Fighters (you may better know them as the Taliban which we supplied them with a shit load of weapons to be our mercanaries against the Soviets when they invaded Afghan)<br />MK-Ultra<br />Fast and Furious operation<br />People who never broke the law having bugs on their car from the CIA because they were of Arab discent, but born in America and no terrorist ties.

Fight back and go to prison? Take them to court so there friends (judges,attorneys,ect..) can say they don&#039;t see anything wrong with what happened? So that the police can threaten or black mail the jury into saying not guilty?????

				All governments break the law when they want something bad enough. Netherlands seems like a place that turns the cheek on a lot of illegal activity and I am sure a lot of government officials get a kick back for it too. Netherlands is known to be a distribution hub for Europe. You don&#039;t actually think all the drugs get into the country because someone is that good at smuggling them do you?&nbsp; Never mind you probably do in your black and white world where the authorities follow the rules and the bad guys have to out smart them.<br /><br />Are you just really young or are you that brainwashed by the media? <br /><br />I feel like SR has been flooded in the past few months by teenagers. I am not being sarcastic either. The quality of the forum has plummeted since I joined. I am a really understanding person, but when people make threads and it is just such a common sense answer like, &quot;I want to make a purchase, but how do I know it isn&#039;t a LE sting?&quot;&nbsp; Such a waste of time and space on the forum. If you want to buy drugs over the internet at least post like you are mature enough to do so even if you aren&#039;t.<br /><br />I guess I am done ranting and being nasty. I enjoy this place and it pisses me off that half the people who post anymore act like they can&#039;t complete a thought. Nomad&#039;s common sense should be a required buy from now on for all new accounts. It is in short supply.

The helped launder a bunch of cartel money to find the source of it, but never found the source or seized the accounts. <br /><br />The government helps cartels move dope and money from America to Mexico in exchange for information on the competing cartels. El Chapo Guzman isn&#039;t dead or captured not because the U.S. doesn&#039;t have the capabilities to locate him. His cartel gives out information on shipments and activities of the competing cartels. <br /><br />The United States funded the paramilitary rebel group FARC in Colombia and trained them. Now we try to kill them and arrest them while they wear Army uniforms that we gave them still. <br /><br />

Drugs have been a part of humanity for thousands of years.They are ignorant and naive to think they can tell people they cant make there own choices when it comes to drugs.Look at this one under ground website.You can buy any drug imaginable from any continent (besides Antarctica maybe) and from several countries within each continent.Imagine if you will the &quot;revenant child&quot; who is selling durban poison from africa.If he sells it online how many people do you think sell it off line in the streets in africa? In your local area imagine how many people do at least one type of drug.There are plenty of people who use drugs in small towns and there are thousands just in the U.S. then theres an even larger number in the medium sized cities then a huge amount in the big cities.For all the local people you know that do drugs there are people just like you and your friends in the next town over and the next town and the next town ALL OVER.The same goes for the U.K. and europe all those people you know that do drugs there are towns and cities like yours by the thousands.The government and world are fighting a war that they can never win.They are wasting money and time,pointless murders,people who have one life and they are spending it in prison because of non violent drug crimes.From america to mexico to all the european countries to asia to australia in new zealand and canada.When they take one lab down another pops up why cant they just see that you cant take away the right a person has to choose if they get high? They will never win this war no matter how many people they lock up or kill.The drug war is pointless its a joke its a waste of time and money and peoples lives that are labeled criminals and felons because they get high.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				When I recently tried to purchase from a new-ish vendor and he PMed me back saying he was &#039;out of stock&#039; that got me thinking: they could easily set up as&nbsp; vendor, game the system to build rep, then offer something for really good prices (cocaine or oxy, something people want badly), then collect say 20 addresses and cancel the orders without shipping anything (&#039;sorry bro, I&#039;m all out of product..&#039;). Then they would start pulling the mail on those 20 addresses (who are likely placing other orders). Eventually get enough to bust, say 10 of them, then do a big PR thing (&quot;Police make multiple arrests across country related to the Amazon.com of drugs site...&quot;). For this reason I employ a strategy that changes my address periodically. <br /><br />I think they haven&#039;t done this already because they generally move slow and it would require some actual work, which govt types hate to do. <br /><br />Of course, this wouldn&#039;t shut down SR, only give people a scare and maybe slow things down for a bit. We, the SR community, would find a way around it eventually (maybe only use established vendors), but a few folks would be made examples of.<br /><br />As for me, I&#039;ve been very impressed by our community. I think one of the best things we can do is make this site safe for people to use by aggressively screening out scammers, pedobears and other sleazy types. <br /><br />If we take care of ourselves and look out for one another SR will be around a long time and WE THE PEOPLE will have won a war for once.<br />

				As a community we need to stay alert, voice any concerns or suspicious activity and never ever get complacent on SR. You can bet your bottom dollar they won&#039;t stop trying to figure out a way to infiltrate and bring down SR and LE certainly has the capacity and resources to do just that. New vendors should be scrutinized and questioned in the hope of flushing out any LE. Hard to do but something that will require an ongoing effort from all concerned. :)

Much of this trade is done through &quot;cut-outs&quot; – essentially cartels that are granted favored status. The United States&#039; current fave is the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico – this connection has been long understood by many Mexican journalists.<br /><br />IMHO &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; was actually a blown op in which the cartel was being intentionally supplied with weapons by their benefactors within the U.S. LE establishment. Conspiracy theory? Perhaps (although that phrase has been so badly maligned as to have lost all objective meaning). But dig a little deeper into this topic and I think you&#039;ll be shocked by what you discover. I&#039;d recommend Michael Ruppert&#039;s &quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot; as a good place to start.

				.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />This brings to mind the &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; fiasco.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure a lot of you know what I&#039;m talking about, but basically ATF agents sold weapons to some Mexican drug cartels in order to track their movements.&nbsp; A few weeks later, it was discovered those very weapons were used in murders, creating a huge public fuck-up for the ATF.&nbsp; If they could do it with weapons, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they could do it with drugs.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I think in this case what happened was the ATF did sell REAL guns to one cartel group out in mexico, The reason for this sting was to trace the whereabouts of the higher ups.. they only sent in top notch guns.... guns that would be delivered to high ranking members. ( not pos glocks)<br />These guns were fitted with gps but what happened is the cartel found out and cleaned the guns which then were used in murders... what I&#039;m saying here is yes LE they can sell guns and drugs but would never be able to get such permission unless the target was a threat to national security.. such as the mafia, cartels, terrorists, ect.. there not gonna be out here selling shit trying to catch us when they have to many drug dealers in the streets to deal with as it is...<br /><br />the only&nbsp; LE I really worry about is postal inspectors.. these guys can do anything and because of national security are on top of things, unlike cops who are to busy with the real world...

				There&#039;s no doubt that LE are racking there brains in a bid to devise a plan of attack to take SR and other such sites down. There problem is that overall, most users of this site are using it safely and they will struggle to intercept any communication as long as people are using PGP. LE would have some higher ranked officers putting together submissions in regards to possible points of weakness on SR they could exploit and infiltrate.That&#039;s not an easy task and will not get any easier as site security and user safety measures improve. One things for sure, they won&#039;t give up their fight but equal to the task are all users and staff of this site who love all it stands for and will never want to see it taken down.

				FUCK THIS SHIT!!! dangggg.. all this LE talk has got me mad paranoid... its so true.. LE could come on here and make several buys from a seller and try to track him down if they want.. I think the only safe way to go is bu changing accounts.... its seems stupid...and it might not work but if you change to a new account on a monthly basis it would be harder for the to track you.. because one min they have a lead on you.. next your gone and back under a new name.. new pics..new prices.. new text.. new everything.... <br /><br />thats the only way I see to protect myself from LE even tho its just weed.. in the last day I read about 2 SR vendors who got fucked by Canadian cops..<br /><br />i feel so lost...<br /><br />what to do, what to do???<br />

				I like that you like my idea.. but it would<br /><br />1- be costly<br />2- be time consuming<br />3-you would have to figure out who the real &quot;kosher&quot; clients are and contact them so they can still find you.<br />4- gotta build new feedback..<br /><br />IT IS BY FAR THE BEST IDEA TO STAY ONE STEP AHEAD<br /><br />like as soon as the LE has the time to make 3 or 4 purchases the account is closed and so is there case and now they have to start all over again..<br /><br />maybe soon some SR mods will have some insight into this and hopefully in the future we can figure out how to implement an idea like this

				It&#039;s not as hard as you think. It&#039;s much easier to do as a buyer, but for some vendors with well over 300 transactions, I&#039;d rather shell out 150 and keep my freedom.

				Are bitcoins illegal?<br /><br />L.E. as a honeypot...LOL !!!<br /><br />Is there a different law for L.E. so they can possess illegal drugs?<br /><br />Just an other stupid question!<br /><br />To sell drugs is a real big crime!<br /><br />To buy a little is not.<br /><br />L.E. can not commit a big crime just to catch you for a little crime.<br /><br />And when the have confiscated drugs they have to destroy those drugs once it has done it use as evidence.<br /><br />At least that&#039;s the law where i live. The police can not even follow a shipment to find out who the big guys are.<br /><br />Cause they have lost track of such shipments in the past.<br /><br />So no if the police can prevent to let the drugs enter the market, they have to act, before those drugs do enter the market again.<br /><br />But maybe the police is the biggest supplier of narcotics in the states, it wouldn&#039;t surprise me&nbsp; at all !<br /><br />They sell even weapons to Iranians who keep Americans hostage etc !

				Just to point out a few fallacies by the &quot;LE could never&quot; crowd.<br /><br />There are some vendors here who only sell large amounts.<br />LE doesn&#039;t have to sell heroin to children to prove themselves as sellers either, we have many drugs to choose from, and many of them are quite safe, and are commonly found in evidence lockers.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are even vendors who don&#039;t sell anything illegal, like 5000 pack of baggies, and stuff like that.<br /><br />Even though MOST large vendors only vend, SOME are also buyers - cross referencing locations by purchases/sales and TOR activity would make it relatively easy to get a warrant to search.&nbsp; Packaging and package origins are definitely catalogued.<br /><br />One user was correct in stating that international buys, customs aside, are probably safer due to difficulties from borders and co-operation between countries.<br /><br />LE in most western countries CAN sell drugs as part of sting operations.<br /><br />Just because you cannot fathom how someone would get caught, doesn&#039;t mean there isn&#039;t someone out there who can figure it out.<br />This is why we all should avoid letting our guard down here, and ALWAYS take the appropriate precautions.<br /><br />When I read someone encouraging shitty security, or downplaying the risks here, my first though is LE.&nbsp; Anyone with half a brain knows, be cautious.&nbsp; When dealing with this stuff, some reasonable paranoia is your best friend.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had people here make me some pretty strange offers off and on over the years, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever accept free samples again either.

				It&#039;s not really worth it - they&#039;ll just end up with a bunch of personal users.

Here&#039;s a snippet...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Silk Road users further boost security by discussing techniques to hide drugs from customs and postal services, and by vetting the integrity of sellers and their products. <br /><br />This information sharing was so effective that the report notes existing &quot;forensic examination of posted items and packaging yields no information&quot;, pointing to the sophistication of postage techniques.<br /><br />The report said the impact of the open discussion on the security of the marketplace &quot;cannot be underrated&quot; and suggests law enforcement agencies should heed the lessons and use &quot;power to the crowd&quot; to combat the Silk Road.<br /><br />This would involve an audit of police skills across Australia to map strengths and weaknesses within police cyber units and improve training. It would compliment the previously stated priority given by Australian police for &quot;reducing cross-border barriers to law enforcement and prosecution&quot;.<br /><br />The report flagged possible attacks against the Tor network, and cited previous research including Perez-Gonzalez and Crandall&#039;s timing and fingerprint analysis, and man-in-the-middle attacks against exit nodes. It said it was unknown if the latter attack was possible against Tor hidden services. <br /><br />Police could also benefit from research and development undertaken within unspecified national security agencies.<br /><br />Other avenues to attack the Silk Road flagged in the report include social engineering, :o intersections between online transactions and the real world, and by targeting user error.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />So apparently all the bullshit regarding Aussie buyers scamming hard, or vendors SSing to Aus are most likely the result of &quot;Social Engineering&quot; to disrupt and deter Aussie users and vendors who may ship here. And of course the follow on effect of ACTUAL scammers and ss&#039;ers deciding to do so. As one journalist observed it&#039;s funny how the higher their ratings and more forum posts a buyer has, the less likely they were to report being ripped off...<br /><br />I also tend to think some people have forgotten what it is they&#039;re buying off here. It&#039;s class A fucking narcotics people, don&#039;t let the buyer feedback and ratings system fool you into thinking it&#039;s anything other than a criminal act that MAY send you to prison. There is NO limit to what LE will do for a drug bust, read this...<br /><br />The first story almost made me cry with sadness/rage, seriously. The cunt did this for a dime bag of weed...<br /><br />http://www.alternet.org/story/154164/how_an_attractive,_undercover_cop_posed_as_a_student_--_then_entrapped_a_smitten_teen_to_%22sell%22_her_marijuana<br /><br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2116721/Undercover-policeman-poses-high-school-student-EIGHT-MONTHS-busts-12-students-drug-sting.html<br /><br />anyways that&#039;s just two examples of how LE will sink to all-time lows to make you do the right thing and save your from yourself.<br />There is NO limit to their douchbaggery, you will see. Just wait until some rich white kid from the suburbs drops dead than watch those political fucks try to scare us into action and votes.<br /><br />PS there are many LEO&#039;s active on these boards, count post means nothing. LEO&#039;s are able to infiltrate SERIOUS crime rings with daily face to face contact over many years, undercovers are good at what they do, really good. These people&#039;s job is to catch YOU, teams of people are being paid good money to sit around and browse these boards and build intel, this is how it works. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some LEO&#039;s have reached &#039;HERO status&#039; on their post count. It&#039;s only matter of time until something gives. Either it strengthens SR or destroys it to make way for the next one. <br />The only certain/constant is the knowledge that this concept will NEVER die!<br />Peace

Don&#039;t get me wrong, I LOVE this place and all that it stands for, however, this sort of complacency is what LE will target if an opportunity arises. Just because the general public doesn&#039;t see or hear about the investigative work being done behind the scenes to take SR down, doesn&#039;t mean LE, from all parts of the globe, aren&#039;t feverishly trying to develop new methods, techniques and strategies on how to infiltrate SR security and bring down the most brazen, illegal website in history, making millions of untaxed dollars for the owner/s.&nbsp; <br />I doubt any Government/Agency/Organization would disclose to the public, any inroads they might have made into taking the site down. Once this info was broadcast to the world, it would be immediately plugged by the Admins, perhaps even by the myriad of tech heads floating around SR and the SR Forum, which would defeat any purpose of looking for vulnerabilities in the SR operation. There is not a shadow of doubt in my view that there&#039;s a lot of work going on behind the scenes on permanently taking down SR, especially as it&#039;s grown exponentially over the last 6 months or so. Being as popular as it&#039;s ever been with a huge influx of new members whilst remaining hidden from Law Enforcement for an extended period of time, would suggest to me a good reason the Government doesn&#039;t like raising this topic in Public arenas or to certain media outlets. It&#039;s an absolute embarrassment for them, especially when the majority of the general public wouldn&#039;t know the Hidden Web even exists, let alone what it actually is and can be used for. LE are of course monitoring these Forums and will always be searching for an opportunity or situation where they can take advantage and exploit it for all that it&#039;s worth. Hence the reason Personal Responsibility is so important and an essential element in staying safe on SR. The Forum is filled to the brim with a wealth of valuable information on any topic related to SR you could think of. Continually educating yourself on all things SR related will offer you the best chance of staying safe. There&#039;s NO GUARANTEES with anything in life and there will always be a risk when involving yourself in an illegal activity. Minimizing any calculated risks one takes with a common sense approach is virtually all you can do to keep yourself safe when actively using SR, for the time being anyway!!&nbsp; ;) ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />

				LEO can sell drugs..&nbsp; Watch the show &quot;COPS&quot; - for fuck sake you dont need a law degree to understand a tv show on fox. <br /><br />Also, Always use encryption.&nbsp; LEO only has to sniff exit nodes to strip unencrypted addresses being passed through.&nbsp; Legally they need a warrant to do so, However you don&#039;t even have to be LEO to sniff,&nbsp; any tech savvy script kiddie can do this. <br /><br />Sorry for sounding so hash but I normally dont take tax advice from third world tech support.&nbsp; Look out for yourself and learn how this technology works to protect youself instead of asking if LEO can do this or that.

				Even if cops couldn&#039;t sell drugs as part of a sting, they wouldn&#039;t have to to set up a honeypot here on SR - just spam a bunch of positive feedback from fake users who supposedly received goods. I get skeeved out every time I check out vendor feedback and go down the list of rave reviews<br /><br />Mr. Wizard (posting history: 2 posts) &quot;Great product. Great stealth. Will buy again&quot; <br />Davy Jones (1 post) &quot;Super fast shipping. This vendor is the man.&quot;<br />Lizard King (3 posts) &quot;Top notch product. Way better than street.&quot; <br /><br />etc, etc. If I don&#039;t see at least a couple of happy buyers with a serious posting history, I walk. <br /><br />Granted, people are right - what would a honeypot vendor snag aside from some low level buyers? No one is going to buy bulk from unknowns. Problem is, SR is international. It&#039;s world wide. There&#039;s a ton of LE orgs out there and there&#039;s no way they&#039;re all headed up under one Super Agency. So that means not just one, necessarily rational, strategy. Maybe the DEA is biding their time, working crypto. Maybe CSIS is working the postal angle. Maybe the Gendarmes are muscleing street dealers, thinking at least some of them must double online, looking to turn them. And some other little pissant agency is running a honeypot so they can blackmail low level users into working for them on the Road. Who knows. I assume nothing.

				I see what you are saying and understand how this could be a reason to and I did consider this but at the end of the day they have limited resources, its not just paying for a speed gun and a police mans hourly rate which comes straight back in revenue for the police force, its time, effort, and beyond a basic police man with 4 C grades in GSCE ( basic pass in uk ) once they know your address they can go knock on your door and politely ask if then can come in, they wont get a warrant, hopefully everybody on here knows to tell them that they cannot help them. or they can do a controlled delivery. These are costly to prove in court unless you admit anything,If you have taken correct measures as most people do on here you wont open it straight away and inform the post man you are not expecting anything. write on it return to sender etc then leave it at least a few hours before opening they will not get a case at all. This will have cost a lot of money. Im not saying it cant happen, its very unlikely they will go to this effort for a buyer, anyways the mums will want the dealers not the buyers.

Mind you, you don&#039;t get the keys to the house and car unless you&#039;re talking dealing, but that can be imputed by amount. Everybody knows better than to keep more than personal amounts around, but it&#039;s a supply chain with an uncertain future. I&#039;m sure there are more than a few buyers who have stocked up. <br /><br />Anyway, again, it may not be rational. But take a thousand LEAs and not all of them are going to have the patience or the resources for the long game. If I were some major org like the DEA, I think I&#039;d be feeling some stress at the thought that the little guys *aren&#039;t* under my thumb and may do something stupid while bigger plans are afoot.<br /><br />Also, what the hell, I&#039;ll come right out and say it. I have a particular concern with buyers-turned-CIs, because I depend on my instincts to suss out LE. If it&#039;s not LE, just some guy under LE&#039;s thumb? Harder to get a sense, I think. And I&#039;ve posted elsewhere about LE potentially making buys to identify vendor stealth methods. Some aren&#039;t distinctive, so no problem. For others it might be. End of the day it&#039;s back to Trust No One. But take a small-ish domestic venue on SR (like Canada), and you find yourself considering vendors without that rock solid history, without established buyers vouching for them, and then you either trust your instincts or you walk away without product. Or buy international and take a different kind of risk.

				The truth is NO ONE other than the Police themselves, will know exactly what they are working on behind the scenes in their attempts a take SR down. You can speculate or listen to innuendo, rumors and gossip from those who think they may know, however the truth is they factually don&#039;t know anything&nbsp; other than their own theories or beliefs on what may happen. We can&#039;t control what LE are planning to do but it&#039;s a different story when related to ourselves as individuals.<br />Therefore, in saying that, the one thing that each and every one of us can control are our own actions and level of personal security measures we put in place. We want to make it as difficult as possible for LE to gather any sensitive information on us which may compromise our anonymity. My feeling is we should all be overly cautious and do things over and above when it comes to protecting our security and anonymity from LE. Make no mistake, if you&#039;re there for the picking, they will strike while the iron&#039;s hot. If your lax in the security measures you implement, then you are going to pay the price should you come to the attention of the Authorities. At some stage down the line, I believe there will be an all out attack on SR using a new tactic unbeknown to the general population or a new approach on an already devised attack which looks at other ways of exploitation. While I&#039;m sure DPR has done all he can to prepare for such things, none of us will actually know other than the attackers themselves. My point is that it will be an attack not yet seen, a new development undisclosed to the public, which would be LE&#039;s best chance of infiltration. Current methods of attack have been unsuccessful which is a testament to DPR&#039;s skills and intelligence relating to Internet Security. The way SR is set up, a Tor Hidden Service on the Hidden Web, makes just finding the site practically impossible for the time being. Although, what happens in the future remains to be seen. :)
