				So I placed an order with a vender at the beginning of last week for what would be a very small personal amount of cannabis. The vendor I ordered from has&nbsp; long history, a perfect rating, over 300 transactions and over 750 fans. The transaction proceeded very quickly and was placed into &quot;In Transit&quot; status within a day.&nbsp; Five business days later the shipment had not arrived. Based on past experience with this vendor, I expected the shipment to arrive within 3 days.<br /><br />After waiting six days I began to get a little bit nervous that perhaps the package had been lost, stolen or intercepted. I wrote to the vendor and quickly received a response. The vendor explained that one of his packages was recently intercepted by LE and that for his security and mine he decided to suspend all shipments.<br /><br />Now, for whatever reason this vendor chose to not contact me with some sort of notification about delaying my shipment. Additionally, said vendor has not pulled any of his listings from the marketplace. This seems odd to me. My house is fairly clean so I&#039;m not having a complete freakout about a controlled delivery knocking at my door. My question is this, shouldn&#039;t this sort of news/order status update be provided to current customers? Should this vendor be considered unsafe? Do vendors have the ability to cancel an order once it the status is marked as &quot;In Transit&quot;?<br />

				I&#039;m going to reserve judgement (and probably regret it), but it seems entirely reasonable to suspect in a healthy paranoid way that the vendor himself is completely compromised and is now a shill for LE. Why leave product listings up if he cannot provide a status for orders placed last week?

				Who is this vendor?&nbsp; Even if your paranoia is unwarranted, the community should know if a vendor isn&#039;t currently shipping orders (unless its stated on his page, or elsewhere in the forums).

				Who is the vendor? I am waiting on a package from a vendor as well... I have always received the previous orders in 2-3 days and this one is taking longer...

				I&#039;ve made some specific suggestions to the vendor. If he doesn&#039;t follow through, I&#039;ll come back with more information.
