				If you were to raise your prices slightly to include shipping in the cost of the item itself instead of having it be separate, I think more people would feel like they are getting a good deal. maybe this is like &quot;psy ops&quot; or something? I don&#039;t know. but many sellers do free shipping on here already. for example instead of an item priced at $150 plus $12 for shipping, a flat $165 with free shipping would actually seem like a better deal, even though the price is higher than before, so it would be a win-win for both seller &amp; buyer. I think people love Silk Road because it feels like there&#039;s no middleman taking a cut; whether or not that&#039;s the case is beyond the scope of this topic. But, to blend the shipping cost into the item price would provide the illusion of having even fewer middlemen. Just my opinion. Thanks for what you do.

				There are a couple issues with that. For one, there in extra commission lost when doing that. But more importantly (to me) is that people can not get combined shipping then. If shipping is baked into the price you can&#039;t pay for shipping once and buy 4 different things from the same vendor.

				I&#039;ve always offered free priority shipping domestic and never added it to the cost.<br />I know several more prominent drug vendors that at first glance looks more expensive than other vendors but they have just chanfed the shipping to free and added the priority cost to the item. Also sometimes you are not just buying the item or it&#039;s postage but reilablity, professionalism and high consistent quality.<br /><br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				I agree. The shiphment price shouldn&#039;t be in the buyes pocket... aat least divided.. some times i can&#039;t buy something because the shipment price is so high
