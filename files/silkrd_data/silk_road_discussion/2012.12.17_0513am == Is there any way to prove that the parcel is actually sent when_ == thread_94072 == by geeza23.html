				I mean except for tracked parcels, is there any way to prove that a vendor actually sent a package out? Especially to those countries with extremely tight customs, there may present an opportunity for a vendor to &quot;selectively&quot; scam buyers so to speak. I mean I&#039;m most vendors with a high feedback ratings wouldn&#039;t do it, but theoretically speaking it is feasible right?

				There is no real way to prove a package was sent without tracking. And unfortunately yes there are always sellers that selectively scam people. The best option in an instance like that is simply resolve the purchase (get 50% back) and if something smells fishy provide poor feedback.<br /><br />Best recommendation would be to NEVER finalize early. Also stick with sellers that have been on SR for a long time or provide tracking information for packages. Reading up on sellers on the forums beforehand is also valuable to weed out selective scammers.

				i just posted a post called how to scam a vendor and get drugs and full refund not to mention give the a 1/5 feedback its in shipping and vendor roundtable. <br />ill give you coles notes. customer buys drugs from you in CANADA we do not have ability to add tracking to regular letter mail. so no tracking . customer kniows this, so waits about 5 days and sends it directly to resolution stating they know 100% that the vendor did not ship. because they know you did not track because you cant track it. to track in canada the cheapest method is expedited parcel $7. most wont use for a small order.customer can now do 1 of 2 things, 1 sit back and wait for sr to give refund and get the drugs in mail. 2 send you threading messages holing feedback hostage and also telling srt to take your vendor site away unless you give 100% refund. . this is a 100% win for customer. i know it happened to me in resolution.<br />i sent sr staff the 10 pages of messages from this customer, you can clearly read they threaten me, against sr policy. they blackmail me to give refund or i get terrible feedback. they hold all the cards.<br />sr does not take our policy&#039;s for resend/refund into account you can say 0 refundé0 resend unless seizure letter, but when someone claimed you defrauded them, by saying you did not send package ,no tracking so of course you can not prove it, now i have 2 maybe 3 others doing it. i have sent 66 packages all got to their destination,can i prove some no , why? because i sent regular mail. in canada we cant add tracking for 75 cents. .this problem is going to get out of control and we are going to have to send all packages min. expedited, yes customer pays shipping but regular mail makes it almost 100% of the time, how many ties can you remember a bill not getting to you, really;<br />my problem here is SR accepted this resolution and gave this customer 75% refund. what the hell.i did not even explain the whole story. this person wrote to me begging me to lowwer the price she did not have enough ,I DID IT, still not enough, she did it again now asking for custom order and wants extra tabs as she had ordered from me prior for 1 free tab and i sent her 3, they sure made ir!!<br />so now i have lowered price x2 and made a custom order for her.with serious bonus tabs, see paid $220 for over $400 worth of drugs. so she got my $400 dollars worth og drugs and SR gave her $75% cash back, i cant fing believe it.<br />now im on my second person doing this and the timeline is exactly same. same mo exactly. its in resolution now, what do you think is going to happen, full refund this time. <br /><br />ps to top it off she gave me a 1é5 feedback which if you are a vendor knows means alot your 100% is gone, and the snowball effect occurs, new,old,currant customers panic ask what the hell, are you going to do this to me. once you drop from 100% to anything but 100% doubt enters everybody&#039;s mind and that can kill a business if noit handled right . we as vendors especially in canada need to do something about sending regular mail, i said before i know the customer pays shipping but to use expidute or express or priority it is way more work, going ino post office, maybe you can buy prepaid bit if its international you still need to go in, its just more risks 10 fold. <br />i know im blabbing and probably repeating myself but we need some answer&#039;s from SR <br /><br />1 if i ship can to can regular mail i can not track it, so you are then saying i did not send package, because my policy tell customers about regular mail use and they have to trust that i send out every order i get. and they are not abe to use the HE DID NOT SEND DEFENSE AS I SENT NO TRACKING.<br />sr need to put out a new policy on regular letter mail canada post, and if they are going to continue to believe that a vendor in canada who sent regular mail ,unable to track, did not send and they will give any % refund at all; they better be prepared to tell all Canadian vendors to remove regular letter mail NOW.

				UK vendors can get a certificate of posting when they ship, but you have to go into the post office, it doesn&#039;t cost anything and it doesn&#039;t track, it just proves you posted a package to that address.
