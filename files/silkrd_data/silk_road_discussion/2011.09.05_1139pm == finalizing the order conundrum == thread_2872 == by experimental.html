				Once the item arrives, leave feedback saying what you just said here. Then, once you&#039;ve tried the product out, update your feedback with the results.

(or not)<br /><br />you can always go back and edit your feedback - just remember that finalization allows the seller to be paid and confirms receipt of your product. \<br /><br />it&#039;s a monstrous grey area. if this is your first time buying from the seller i understand, too. i had an order for DMT that i finalized, but i haven&#039;t tried it yet. if and when the <br /><br />product is bunk, i will of course update my feedback. (I left a 5/5 because the guy shipped timely and the packaging was excellent, so was his communication).<br />&nbsp;<br />Also, you can always report here in the forums on your experience.<br /><br />ï£¿L

				what i did with few of my orders was finalize as soon as I got the product. if i happened to try the product on the same day, i finalized and stated how happy (read high) I was with it.<br /><br />on other orders, i went ahead and updated my previous feedback witch originally stated &quot;have not tried yet but looks 100% legit&quot; to &quot;product tried. product 100% legit :-)&quot;<br /><br />you get the idea. the more feedback you leave the better. don&#039;t just say 3 words. be descriptive without revealing details about packaging etc.

				Not finalizing is the online equivalent of that guy smoking your shit saying he&#039;ll pay you for it and then keeps telling you the money is in his bank day after day....................go figure.....

				I always finalize before trying the product because I figure the seller is probably on the up-and-up, and I want him to get paid.&nbsp; However..... what would happen if I finalize and then discover the product is bunk?&nbsp; I assume my chance at an escrow negotiation would then be lost.

Just look at the sellers previous feedback and if everything looks in order then you have nothing to worry about. However not giving the seller his money (finalizing the transaction) isn&#039;t good for either of you. I&#039;m pretty sure buyer feedback now shows things like finalization, but I could be wrong.
