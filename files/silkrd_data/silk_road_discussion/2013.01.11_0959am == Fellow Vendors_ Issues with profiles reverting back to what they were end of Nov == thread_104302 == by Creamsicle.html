				I am not sure why this keeps happening, but I have updated mny profile on several different occasions recently only to find that all my changes are gone and a much older version of my profile, with inaccurate and outdated information, from the end of November keeps replacing my current one. I was unsure of myself at first and thought maybe I was disconnected after I submitted the update, but I am sure of it now because I made sure it went through the other night when I last updated it. <br /><br />My last update was either 1/7 or 1/9, in which I updated customers on a product update (Fentanyl now 100mcg patches, up from 75mcg), made some clarifications on the MDMA capsules, and announced my new overnight shipping option. The next time I logged back on, which was yesterday (technically) my profile was back to what it was on 11/30 . Very frustrating as customers are getting bad information that I have since improved upon/changed and it&#039;s possibly costing me business. But on the more serious side I worry that this may be the result of more attempts at hacking or broken code/ vulnerabilities.<br /><br />I sent a message to vendor support, just wanted to see if anyone else has noticed this?

				I was told that the backup btc addresses were wiped too.<br />So everyone please check and add your backup btc address to your profile.
