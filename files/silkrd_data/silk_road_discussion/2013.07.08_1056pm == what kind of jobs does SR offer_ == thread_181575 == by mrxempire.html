				I heard that awhile back that SR admins were looking to &quot;hire&quot; people for help with the site. What kind of positions were they offering? I don&#039;t have a lot of computer skills so i doubt I could fill any of the positions, but I was curious what they needed people for. Computer programming stuff?<br /><br />P.S: I am a very excellent lovemaker, so admins send me a p.m if you want to pay me to mac on some undercover cop babes for you

				i&#039;m not trying to be a dick, but i don&#039;t tihnk they&#039;d hand out jobs (no pun intended) to random people. it probably has to be someone who has a long history of roaming the forums and a good reputation; someone who has at least a little trust from the admins/DPR. someone that the forum regulars know, like astor.
