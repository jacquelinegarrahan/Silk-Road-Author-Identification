				Is this really allowed? <br /><br />I know its SR and its the fucking wild west, but how can vendors, who must keep &amp; uphold a sacred trust with buyers, be allowed to blackmail users who don&#039;t give 5/5, threatening to publicize theyrre drop name &amp; address?<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t that break some sort of SR vendor code or something? It basically subverts the rating system, eliminating the leverage buyers have if vendor does a shitty job or fucks up or whatever.<br /><br />The offender vendor here:<br /><br />FauxyDocs<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/77da159d57/10<br /><br /><br />What say you SR? Is this bullshit or no?<br /><br /><br />UPDATE:<br />If you don&#039;t want to read the whole thread, here&#039;s the latest...<br /><br />The offender vendor was told by SR admins to remove the blackmail language, to which they complied &amp; so remaining a vendor (despite numerous calls he should be banned) - througout the vendor has tried to twist words, tried to manipulate the facts of the situation (which backfired), and generally tried to deflect responsibility for their mistake &amp; push it on other people. All just like a little kid.<br /><br />So much for learning from one&#039;s mistakes eh?<br /><br />Caveat Emptor!<br /><br />UPDATE2:<br />Vendor left or got booted not longer after this thread took seed (sometime in July). Good riddance!<br /><br />Let us never put up with such behavior!

				Storing an address after shipping an order out is highly against vendor rules and can have vendor priviledges revoked.<br /><br />Whilst I do not know this is the case, if your order was already mailed and he still has your address and messaged you saying this well I would go ahead and report him to SR ...<br /><br />That is most likely going to have his vendor priviledges revoked.

				Hmmm... you can&#039;t extort buyers, store information, or post shipping addresses in the vendor forum. <br /><br />Trolololo...<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I M P O R T A N T:<br /><br />This message is being written to formalize the consequences for customers trying to extort and/or scam us.<br /><br />We have recently dealt with a user trying to use his feedback for us as leverage for an extra ID. We have also just received our first 4/5 (different user), when the user had nothing but good things to say about our ID. From now on, if you leave anything other than 5/5 feedback, we will have ALL of your information blacklisted via the Vendor&#039;s Roundtable, rendering your real name and shipping address unusuable on Silk Road. Bottom line is that it&#039;s rude and unfair to give less than 5/5 feedback unless there is a legitimate issue; even then, please send us a message and we will resolve. Thanks!<br /><br />If you have no intention on exorting or scamming us, please disregard this, and thank you so much for keeping your honesty and integrity!

				Yeah they say it&#039;s for their protection, and only if someone tries to scame them or some this, but blackmail is blackmail, even if they put it nice words and a smiley face on the end of it.<br /><br />Think it&#039;s a slippery slope to tolerate and allow vendors to openly threaten buyer safety if they disagree on what a &quot;good job&quot; is. It subverts the whole rating system and basically leaves buyer with no option but to give 5/5.<br /><br />My guess is, these are just punk kids trying to act tough but tolerating this attitude really does a disserveice to buyer security on SR IMO.<br /><br />That&#039;s my take anyway.

				@Toska<br /><br />Yes, def. take business elsewhere (unfortunately there are really no other descent sellers on SR for such things right now, but not mater) but think too it sets a bad tone for SR.<br /><br />The damage is beyond just a single buyer.

				I&#039;ve read what it is written in the profile and it is not exactly as you put it.<br />The vendor is saying (as many other vendors do, btw) that if you don&#039;t give 5/5 for a valid reason and without contacting the vendor with your problem before leaving the feedback then your name will be put in the blacklist of vendors for the time being.<br /><br />I find this anyway unacceptable IMO but it is different than publicly revealing buyers addresses.<br /><br />I personally think that something more must be done in the feedback system because as it is now anything short of 5/5 will damage the vendor stats too much and some buyers sometimes use this as a sort of &quot;blackmail&quot; themselves. Certainly is difficult to find a complete solution to this problem, but maybe DPR can come up with something. Still, I repeat that anyway also if there&#039;s clearly an issue with the how the feedback is used by some buyers (and I&#039;ve testified this myself) I think that what the vendor is doing here is a little too much and not acceptable because it is a sort of psychological intimidation on all users, also those that are completely legit and responsible.

The vendor is claiming to store names and addresses after fulfilling the orders; against the rules and insecure. Threatening to share personal information with other vendors (an empty threat), it is ridiculous to threaten that and blights the reputation of every vendor on SilkRoad. It also completely undermines the feedback system to blackmail buyers in this way, and buyers are under zero obligation to discuss with said vendor before leaving 1, 2, 3 or 4 star feedback. Don&#039;t try to justify the behavior of this vendor, because it is just wrong. Their selling privileges on SilkRoad should be permanently revoked because of this, unfortunately they will most likely get off with a warning.

				Silk Road should provide a workflow suggestion or a tool to help manage addresses.&nbsp; Seriously,&nbsp; I know a vendor who mixes up addresses and struggles with organizing them without keeping copies.&nbsp; Even the damn carbon copy part of the express post package has the addy on it.&nbsp; That needs burning or ripped off before writing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps, some kind of countdown beside the address and the instruction for copy and paste only once into a label or sheet.&nbsp; Dunno,&nbsp; but someone can figure something out to discourage added on file.&nbsp; Even when you try, you end up with copies here and there.&nbsp; Kinda shitty.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It&#039;d be soooo cool if there was a Avery label template built into the address field on the order page.&nbsp; Click and print labels without any copying required ever.&nbsp;

If the information is given inside a private listing it is not the same as a public sharing of it (again, from the dictionary: &quot;of, pertaining to, or affecting a population or a community as a whole; open to all persons&quot; - the key words there are &quot;as a whole&quot; and &quot;open to ALL&quot;).<br /><br />I was just pointing out that what the OP implied is something different than what is written in the vendor&#039;s account and the type of blackmail done. In these things you have to be specific. Between publicizing an address and circulating the same in private there is a great difference (and also the type of intervention you apply is usually different). While both are unacceptable by SR rules, giving away publicly (to all people openly, as in an example in this same forum or on the clearnet, for all to see) buyer&#039;s addresses would be much worse than circulating them between vendors. Naturally also in this second case the thing is bad and can possibly leak the information (in case of LE for example being able to hack/employ a vendor&#039;s account or entering SR as a whole) but anyway there is a step more that it&#039;s absent in the first case, making the public availability much worse.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162717.msg1157652#msg1157652">Quote from: lex on May 23, 2013, 12:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The fact this list is not available to fellow customers hardly invalidates the negative publicity.

If you cannot understand the difference between the two aspects and what separate the two both in theoretical and practical terms it is not my fault. What I&#039;m saying is not bullshit and everybody with some intelligence would understand immediately that the thing implied in the OP is a little different (and worse) than what is written in the vendor&#039;s account even if both are unacceptable and bad.<br /><br />Apart this I really don&#039;t get why you are getting all angry at this. It is not that I said that what the vendor is doing is good or anything similar, what&#039;s the point of you bringing up this crusade on what I specified is beyond me.

				Just curious on everyones opinion (vendors and buyers please chime in here) but much do you think that the vendors actually only have the address from the original order and no other copys or info on buyers addys somewhere else, or extra? Iv never been a vendor so I dont know what it takes to juggle orders and stuff from multiple customers with multiple products, but just thinking about it as any other small buisness that ships diff products, I would think that maybee it gets hard to juggle and keep track of who orders what&nbsp; and where its going, especially with the escrow system, the orders that have gone out havent been paid for yet, and with problems arising of customers claiming non deliver or wrong product delivery or what ever, how does a vendor verfiy all that if theres no record kept of anything like were led to believe?<br /><br />is this actually happining alot more then people hope/think or am I off base here and Vendors actually do a good job and stick to the code of not keeping buyers info on record anywhere?<br /><br />Id really like to hear some vendors chime in here<br />

				Yes, Lex gets it, BlackIris you don&#039;t.<br /><br />Vendors have a duty to protect buyers data &amp; security, regardless of whehter the buyer is an asshole. This priority basically puts pressure on vendors to do a great job, behave like grown ups, and not fuck around with bullshit blackmail games.<br /><br />following that, a vendor having a cavelier attitude about this, threatening the security of the buyer&#039;s info, in ANY manner, in ANY way, by keeping ANY info after the deal, is completrely inappropropiraite and against the sanctitiy of all buyers and vendors. <br /><br />No matter what word-games you want ot play, there is no grey area here BlackIris. <br /><br />Get it?

				Alright guys, I want to start off by saying that it was very immature to post a thread behind my back and not directly message me about the issue too. Not exactly sure how I was supposed to find this thread if it wasn&#039;t for a kind forum-goer that messaged me (who also happens to find this childish).<br /><br />Now, to address your concerns:<br /><br />1. The wording of my post doesn&#039;t actually imply that I would EVER be sharing PERSONAL information to the public. I mention that information (more specifically, usernames) will be reported to the Vendor&#039;s Roundtable, but that isn&#039;t by any means against the rules. If you happen to see where I say &quot;I WILL SEND YOU NAME AND ADDRESS TO OTHER VENDORS&quot;, please let me and SR support staff know. (Hint: I don&#039;t).<br /><br />I have messaged a few other vendors about this, and they all said this is indeed allowed as long as this information is not kept after order is shipped. I don&#039;t keep personal information after an order is shipped, but I DO keep note of which SR members UNJUSTLY give less than 5/5 feedback. Then, I would send this information to the Vendor&#039;s Roundtable AFTER messaging the user how I can fix the problem (refund, re-ship, etc). So, basically, there is no reason why I would ever deserve less than a 5/5 because if I am offering a 100% refund AND a re-ship, they would be getting more out of the transaction than what they initially put in. The two members that gave me 1/5 didn&#039;t respond when I politely messaged them.<br /><br />Also, there is not one time where I posted a member&#039;s personal information anywhere (if that&#039;s what you thought I was doing to begin with). Silk Road support staff can verify this as well. I have not broken any rules, but I supposed I worded my post inappropriately, and for that, I am sorry.<br /><br />In conclusion, I still want to emphasize that I&#039;m ecstatic to be a member on this revolutionary site, but I do not wish to do business with those of mal-intent. If you leave less than 5/5 feedback but have nothing bad to say about the order, I take that as a direct attack, and WILL report your username to the Vendor&#039;s Roundtable. I think I can speak for the majority of vendors when I say that it is very frustrating to work your very hardest to satisfy each and every customer, and then get a 4/5, knocking down your feedback score 1 percent. Very unfair how customers have more power than vendors, and can temporarily ruin a vendor&#039;s business by leaving a nasty review, thus scaring away other customers.<br /><br />2. We don&#039;t sell to anyone above the age of 23. Problem? If yes, you are implicitly condoning identity theft which is actually against the rules here on Silk Road, so I recommend ending this concern here.<br /><br />All in all, if you&#039;re going to blast a vendor, make sure he/she is AWARE you&#039;re blasting him so he can defend himself. I have no doubt that Silk Road support will understand my point of view on this important issue, and thank you &quot;BlackIris&quot; for being the only member here to actually read my post, and accurately decipher it (for the most part; I don&#039;t break any rules, and I have read the rules many times, thank you).

				You have to keep in mind though, FauxyDocs, that buyers don&#039;t have access to the Vendor Roundtable so when you say something like how you&#039;re going to post their name and address on the blacklist there, they don&#039;t realize that the blacklist doesn&#039;t actually contain anyone&#039;s real name or any shipping addresses.&nbsp; So of COURSE they&#039;re going to be concerned!&nbsp; I think you are well-aware of this fact and are using it to intimidate buyers who think there&#039;s really a place here that allows their name and address to be posted when there absolutely IS NOT.

Please let me know if you don&#039;t think there is.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t my responsibility to publicize the discussions of a private sub-forum on Silk Road, and I believe that is actually against the rules!!!<br /><br />Furthermore, your claim of me using that post as an intimidation factor is pure-speculation (and false!), so that&#039;s not exactly fair basis to be reporting me.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know that OP would misread and spread misinformation, and for that, OP should be ashamed of himself.&nbsp; It might have helped if I was messaged about this prior to a public thread, although I&#039;m glad this is cleared up for the most part.<br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns about this pressing issue, please reply on this thread.

While this can be a little intimidating for legit buyers, it is COMPLETELY different than saying that the vendor threaten to release contact information publicly, isn&#039;t it? C&#039;mon!<br /><br />To the vendor. I would personally re-word the thing a little because as it is put I think it looks more intimidating than it should (and also I personally interpreted it in a way that you kept contact information and shared it with other vendors in the way it is written atm). I would not specify for example that one has to put 5/5 absolutely but put it in a way as to say that &quot;if you act as a spammer or in a non-responsible manner other vendors will be shared how you behaved with us&quot; or similar. Just a friendly hint.

Even if we try everything in our power there is still buyers who don&#039;t care and neglect to do the right thing.<br />I only ask them to contact me before leaving anything less than a 5/5 to at least give me the chance to make sure they are 100% satisfied. Out of 161 transactions I have 1 person who gave me a 4/5 rating, this brought me from 100% to 99%. This 1% is enough reason for a new customer to look somewhere else for product. You want to know his reason for leaving the 4/5 rating? A post office error, his package was returned to the sender. I think it was a USPS screw up. Soon as the package was returned we more than doubled his order and re-shipped it to him express. From his $5 order I spent over $40 to try and keep my 100% rating, is this fair? I have never done any of my customers wrong, not 1 of them. I am very thoughtful and try my best to go above and beyond and work out any kind of errors the best I can even if it involves me losing money.<br />Here is the feedback he left<br />&quot;my packages from sed seller are usually here much faster but there was alot extra and a one gram sample&quot;<br />Do you think it was fair for him to leave this without even attempting to send us a message? We are very very good about customer service and answer our PM&#039;s very very fast and as professionally as we can. This problem was something out of my control. I did the best I could for this guy, and him being a returning customer who had ordered a few times should of at least sent us a PM before killing our score. Please look at both sides.<br /><br />

				If you don&#039;t try to scam the vendor, then this isn&#039;t a problem. It&#039;s as simple as that. Your information (whether it be your account name, contact info, address, whatever) won&#039;t be spread as long as it&#039;s a successful transaction, in which case any info pertaining to you would be deleted. I can only imagine people with the intent of scamming FauxyDocs would have a problem with what he said. <br /><br />While I agree that the paragraph was written for no purpose other than intimidation, it shows how flawed the feedback system really is. All of this would have been avoided if a 4/5 did not negatively affect a vendor&#039;s reputation as much as it does now; however, we must make due with what is established so problems like this do occasionally occur. That being said, a 5/5 is expected if the transaction went flawlessly and the product was as described. Anything less raises concerns with the vendor because of the implementation of the current system. I personally don&#039;t think a lone 4/5 and a few 1/5&#039;s have any harmful implications because any knowledgeable buyer will check out all the real feedback and read reviews and experiences with the vendor before ordering, but ratings like these do hurt prospective sellers who wish to establish themselves as legitimate vendors not only on the Road but also on the forums due to the lack of reputable reviews. If FauxyDocs runs himself a genuine, consistent business, the appropriate ratings will come and will reflect what he is doing, which is why the ratings should have been ignored and the paragraph never written.<br /><br />Both FauxyDocs and OP were in the wrong in this particular situation. FauxyDocs shouldn&#039;t have written the paragraph OR he should have focused it more towards scammers. Expressing that your info will be posted on the vendor&#039;s roundtable for anything less than a 5/5 is blackmail, yes, but a personal message stating your concern should have been sent instead of creating a public thread. Nevertheless, all of the what if&#039;s and should have&#039;s are beside the point. It&#039;s resolved now, but you&#039;ve got to see where he is coming from. A rating other than perfect without messaging the vendor first and without any details about your negative experience isn&#039;t proper etiquette on here (but neither is blackmailing). Whatever, if there is no intention of scamming the vendor, it really shouldn&#039;t be an issue in the first place.

You have every right to leave less than a 5/5 as long as you describe your experience/problem. I&#039;m sure other vendors will let you order from them even if your username is in the vendor blacklist as long as you prove that the item was subpar than what was described. If it&#039;s just complaining, then the vendor would be glad to not do business with you for fear that the same (a negative rating) would happen to them as well. The vendor can always post in the vendor round-table regardless, he doesn&#039;t need to inform you that he posted your name. You can always leave a 5/5 rating while describing what was wrong with the product, too, so the whole issue here is obsolete.

If they have any refund percent I look up their name to see if its a recurring issue. Back in the day when I was a buyer on here, a vendor threatened to put me on the blacklist because I refused to give them 5/5 for some hay shit weed that my grandma could grow better hydroponically out of her toilet bowl. I don&#039;t know if they actually did, but if so that was enough evidence to me of how bull shit the blacklist can be. <br /><br />I create my own personal one....two types of buyers go on it. The ones who threaten to leave 1/5 unless they get a refund, and the ones who constantly ask to pay with other forms of payment (direct deposit, cash in person, western union, etc)<br /><br />What makes me super black list is when people finalize and then complain for a refund, I see this as an attempt to make it not affect their stats. For all you know the buyer could have got every vendor they purchased off of to send a 50% refund, and by finalizing before threatening a 1/5 they could keep their refund rate at 0%. <br /><br />Just my two cents...the blacklist really doesn&#039;t mean much, at least if that vendor ever did put me on it. I had no problem making purchases from there on, and always received quality product. Except the one time dutchaabond screwed me over on an m purchase, but he screwed everyone over that time and SR honoured a 100% refund based on the fact every buyer was not receiving from him. <br /><br /><br />And regarding the topic, any vendors keeping full addresses and names I WOULD AVOID AT ALL COSTS. For me, not tracked item lables go straight to file shredder. Tracked items are arranged with trackings sorted under country and initials and kept encrypted. Hence why I require buyers to give me their ID and country to find their tracking.

As the vendor&#039;s account was written, however, it seemed to me to mean that he kept addresses and for this I said that the vendor was breaking the rules and it was unacceptable (because in that case it would have been). Then the vendor clarified him/herself and it was just a matter of misunderstanding on this point, but at least I could differentiate between a private list and a public reveal of personal information.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162717.msg1162120#msg1162120">Quote from: bbhc52 on May 25, 2013, 03:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do you think it was fair for him to leave this without even attempting to send us a message? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, I don&#039;t think it is fair at all, actually I think that it&#039;s completely irresponsible and unpolite to do a thing like that, and this is exactly the same I&#039;ve written in my thread. It is irresponsible first of all towards other buyers because in this way they cannot base a fair judgment on the various sellers and secondly it is irresponsible towards the vendor that has done nothing wrong. Moreover it is unpolite to not give the chance to recover a mistake even in the (rare, but it can happen) case the vendor commits one.<br /><br />This place has to be built first of all by the same users and for this responsibility is a must. If people act irresponsibly they will ruin the market even for themselves.

				Some buyers are dicks. Some vendors are assholes. When the two meet, it&#039;s Sodom and Gomorrah all over again. <br /><br />Nah, but for real, put that on a vendor page is insane. <br /><br />There&#039;s a meth vendor who has a &quot;contract&quot; on his page that says something like, &quot;By buying from me, you agree to leave a 5/5 feedback or give me a chance to make it right.&quot; That&#039;s not a bad way to do it. I don&#039;t remember if he had a thing about what happens to you if you don&#039;t abide. <br /><br />But what could he do right? Put you on a blacklist? How effective are black lists anyway? I&#039;ve never seen someone come on the forum crying about being on a blacklist and not being able to buy. I guess once the find out, they just make another buyer account.

Why would a 23yo need a fake ID? And I guess you are only selling these to people that would only use them to get into a bar. Not to buy alcohol as that would be a crime.

This guy is clearly about 22 himself and is a dumb fuck vendor.

And dealing with idiots is part of what you sign up for as a vendor..we are supposed to...as vendors...always do the right thing when vending and not act like the morons we sometimes have to deal with. And for sure not be as stupid as some of the buyers. In this case...this vendor is a moron. WITH OUT QUESTION! The fact he put this BULLSHIT UP and the other shit he has said in here alone should get him suspended for a bit. Just so he can read up and understand the vendor &quot;laws&quot; so to speak. New vendors should have to pass a test before they vend. If that was the case....he would not be a vendor. And under NO CIRCUMSTANCES do you threaten to give out a buyers information..no matter how stupid they are. <br /><br />This vendor needs to be suspended for saying the shit he has.

And CLEARLY a joke. <br /><br />But I can tell you that SR takes threats very serious. About the same as TSA takes them. And since these vendors have your name and address and then they say something like this..it could really scare a buyer and DPR will have none of that shit. The vendor should remove that asap.They have a sense of humor..but they do not take kindly to threats of any kind...from exposing PM&#039;s to saying you are going to save their addresses or send a fake hit man from a fake shitty website... If they find out..the vendor will lose his account...even if he is in the top 1%. DPR has done it before....and he will do it again.

I&#039;d guess around 1%. However, anyone above the age of 23 has no other need for a fake ID UNLESS it&#039;s for some fraudulent use (PO box, WU check-cashing, etc), which is why we don&#039;t (and will never) sell to people above the age of 23+. Sorry, but we&#039;re not the only fake ID vendor.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have read a lot of stupid shit by a lot of stupid people. And I have seen a lot of stupid vendors say and do stupid shit. <br /><br />BUT your reasoning that the chances of a 16-23 to commit identity theft at 1%&nbsp; and you saying no one over the age of 23 would need a fake ID unless it is for some fraudulent use witch is why you don&#039;t and never will sell to people above the age of 23 is the stupidest....by far...reasoning I have read from a vendor in over 1 year of reading stupid shit.<br /><br />With your reasoning...why go above the age of 20? Why would a 23yo need a fake ID? And I guess you are only selling these to people that would only use them to get into a bar. Not to buy alcohol as that would be a crime. And I guess the crime of using a fake ID to get into a bar is not a crime to you<br /><br />Also how the fuck do you know if someone is 26 and tells you they are 22? You don&#039;t. In fact you do not know a lot. And buyers should stay the fuck away from you.<br /><br />Also just for the buyers to know...No one in the vendor only forum would give a fuck if this asshole put your name on the do not vend to list. This guy is clearly about 22 himself and is a dumb fuck vendor. We all know he said EXACTLY what the OP said he did and he has since changed it. <br /><br />Do not ever let a vendor threaten you because&nbsp; you left feedback less then 5/5. Though I do believe that you should contact a vendor first and try and work out what your problem is...But when I hear vendors saying &quot;is it fair&quot; I mean come on...who said things are going to be fair?? The buyer can in fact say what he wants in the feedback and leave whatever he wants as feedback. And if you treat the buyers right...you will get 5/5. And if you do not...do not cry about it, or threaten a buyer over it. <br /><br />&nbsp;I knew when he started off his first post in here saying and I quote &quot;it was very immature to post a thread behind my back&quot; that we were dealing with an idiot...I just had no clue he would be this stupid.<br /><br />And other vendors that are chiming in about how they (the buyers) really do not understand all the idiots that we deal with...well that is 100% true...being a vendor here means dealing with people that make this vendor look like Einstein...Yes they are 10x worse then this guy...the fact is...this vendor and this problem has nothing to do with any of that. And dealing with idiots is part of what you sign up for as a vendor..we are supposed to...as vendors...always do the right thing when vending and not act like the morons we sometimes have to deal with. And for sure not be as stupid as some of the buyers. In this case...this vendor is a moron. WITH OUT QUESTION! The fact he put this BULLSHIT UP and the other shit he has said in here alone should get him suspended for a bit. Just so he can read up and understand the vendor &quot;laws&quot; so to speak. New vendors should have to pass a test before they vend. If that was the case....he would not be a vendor. And under NO CIRCUMSTANCES do you threaten to give out a buyers information..no matter how stupid they are. <br /><br />This vendor needs to be suspended for saying the shit he has. PERIOD.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First of all, I&#039;d like to point out that using a fake ID to gain access to a 21+ establishment is much less harmful than using it for fraudulent uses. And what are you even saying with the &quot;why go above the age of 20&quot; question? The drinking age in the USA is 21, and we obviously condone the use of a fake ID for liquor stores, bars, and night clubs, so obviously it should be at least 21. And we raised it to 23 to allow the buyer some leeway in case he/she thinks it&#039;s &quot;suspicious&quot; to have an ID that says your 21. We don&#039;t know your age, so you can be 40 and order a fake ID that says your 23, but good luck having that pass at USPS when trying to open a fake P.O. box. I don&#039;t care how many vendors call us out for this because we&#039;re not going to change the rule EVER. We don&#039;t have a problem with teenagers purchasing alcohol because we believe the drinking age is 3 years too high. And now you might say &quot;Oh, so you&#039;re cool with teenagers drinking and driving and then killing an innocent family?&quot;; if that teenager didn&#039;t purchase a fake ID from us, he would have stolen the alcohol from his parents or had an older sibling purchase it for him, so that point is moot. If you ever decide to make fake IDs, I hope you can live with selling to a terrorist or someone using the ID to purchase an untraceable firearm that may someday kill your son/daughter. It&#039;s fucked up that you&#039;d even expect us to sell to these kinds of people. Silk Road is much more than an &quot;anything goes&quot; community. Do you see firearms here? Do you see child porn here? No, and that is intentional you scumbag piece of shit.<br /><br />Not once did I threaten a buyer&#039;s personal information; don&#039;t try and twist my words into something else. Being a vendor means being respectful to customers and treating them properly, but it does NOT mean you have to lose money from the not-so-legitimate customers.<br /><br />YOU should be suspended for being so disrespectful and close-minded about this situation.

				@FauxyDocs<br />Nice, so instead of owning up to your mistake, you prefer to try to distract with some fiction that my post looking for quality fake IDs has anything to do with your mistake.<br /><br />You are such a child! It&#039;s amazing really.

				Could this be Synaptic (a scammer)?<br /><br />He used to have the same threat on his vendor page.

Check it:<br /><br />Theyre basically 2 fake ID vendors on SR worth even considering (and several not worth considering), but both of the 2 show signs of amateur and not srs quality:<br /><br />1) FauxyDocs<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/77da159d57/10<br />99% feedback is good, but have no confidence, cuz they state flat out only sell to &quot;16-23 yr olds for bitches and bottles&quot; meaning theyre shit &#039;aint up to scratch save for use by kids messin about. <br /><br />Theyz more reasons than &quot;bitches &amp; booze&quot; for fake ID, as my customers tell me, so these&nbsp; guys aain&#039;t it. <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t hep theyre profile basically blackmails buyers threatening to blacklist the drop name &amp; addy on buyers who don&#039;t give 5/5, so they can do a crap job, argue they didn&#039;t, and buyer has no fucking choice? Not cool! <br /><br />Why is that shit even allowed here on SR? That kinda vendor attitude fucks it up for both buyers &amp; vendors!<br /><br />Plus theyre review thread on the forum has only 1 real reveiw from some dumb kid who already got grilled hard 3 times using theyre IDs. <br /><br />So much for these jokers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Looks like he&#039;s having difficulties finding quality forgeries, and so decided to take a different angle (vendor &quot;blackmail&quot;) to cover up the true source of his anger.<br /><br />Oh, and if you hadn&#039;t already figured it out, we don&#039;t sell to 25+ year olds because we don&#039;t want to sell to anyone with potential harmful intentions. Seems like most of the community disagrees with that decision, but it&#039;s our decision, and it&#039;s final.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fraud is fraud. It might be a misdemeanor in some places for a minor to go in and get drinks, but make no mistake about it: you created a fake ID. That, is fraud. And, I think you might want to check your morals. Giving minors a greater chance of making a stupid drunk driving decision, is a lot more harmful than a 40 year old trying to get a PO Box under a false name. You might also want to think about the assumptions you make. He made that thread because he is having issues finding quality forgeries. Quality is not strictly applied to only the product received, it is also applied to the quality of the transaction itself.<br /><br />This thread was started to question the legitimacy of the claims you made in your profile. Coming to defend yourself is not a bad thing, but doing so in a tantrum is. You don&#039;t do yourself any favors by raging and demonstrating that you may, very well, do what everyone is here discussing. Anger does many things, and it can be more powerful than any drug in causing irrational decisions. Based on your demeanor in this thread, whether your vendor profile says it or not, I don&#039;t trust that you won&#039;t. You need to relax, this thread started out as merely criticism of the harshness that you implied with your profile, not a direct attack on you. It only became that, after you pushed it in that direction.<br /><br />Taking action against scammers and those who would intentionally lie for harms sake, is an implied result of wronging another individual. You should take action. Threatening with what could be determined as a method for incriminating one in the performed acts, is not the way you go about it. That is what this thread, is all about. There are plenty of other profiles, who give extremely powerful threats, while maintaining the essence that is SR.<br /><br />I think you should examine what it is to be a vendor here, and remind yourself that there will be those that try to get one over on you. If you let them make a fool out of you, by driving you to behave the way you have here, you will be out of business whether your IDs are good or not.

				I actually got a vendors account suspended one time because he threatened to send me an oz of &quot;reggie weed&quot; just wrapped in toilet paper to my drop. I contacted SR Support and Ajapai was gone the same day. Punk
