				I recently read a piece from the group Anonymous about the personal freedom found on SR, and felt a little pride inside to be a part of something they support. I haven&#039;t seen much talk about them on the forums and I figure they deserve a thread here. You don&#039;t hear as much from them in the news anymore, but it seems like they are still hard at work defending real freedom and exposing government attrition. <br /><br />In a way, I feel like what we do here on the Silk Road helps support Anonymous in action and ideal. Any thoughts, stories, suggestions etc would be awesome. I&#039;m sure there are even members among us that are part of Anonymous, I think you guys are so great.

				I think anonymous is stupid. 95% of what they have done is either nothing-related-to-hacking that they call hacking and then get the stupid as shit media to call hacking, basic script kiddie shit or volunteer botnet DDoS.

It is a stepping stone to complete, total control by a government we don&#039;t trust, I say more power to them.

				You guys are talking about the troll Anonymous, which is the problem. There&#039;s the troll factions, the crusader factions, the protestors, hackers, script kiddies and so forth that make organizing and rallying the amount of potential for the hive mind to do something extraordinary. <br /><br />Fucking LulzSec and Anti-Sec and all that shit. This is like gangbanging for nerds. I don&#039;t know where I lie in the spectrum but it&#039;s becoming disheartening seeing so much conflicting ideology and goals. There&#039;s always like 40 god damn ops at one given point. Nobody is focusing and coming together. I usually only hear about half assed protests like two days before they&#039;re scheduled through a half assed article somewhere quoting some fucktard who wants attention. <br />

				l33t hackers don&#039;t think hide my ass is going to anonymize them, especially after they publicly announce that they use HMA as their VPN. Some of the hackers in anonymous are intermediate level, but they are few and far between. And I have not seen any elite hackers claiming to be part of anonymous. And considering the intermediate hackers are few and far between, they are essentially rough diamonds in a sea of shit. <br /><br />Fact: Anonymous logs into lolita city (felony punishable by minimum five years imprisonment and registration as sex offenders) and gets the public member list of pseudonyms, then posts it on less illegal parts of the internet<br /><br />Fiction: Anonymous brings CP traders on Tor to their knees after using l33t haxx0ring skillz to penetrate the darkest corners of the ciphernet, releasing the names of thousands and thousands of pedophiles!!!!111111<br /><br />Fact: Anonymous gets a few thousand people to run primitive DDoS script causing temporary traffic spikes and transient unreachability to government sites<br /><br />Fiction: Leet anonymous haxx0rs totally pwn highly sensitive government sites, they must have penetrated through world class security, muahahhaha<br /><br />anonymous fiction is what is always reported in the media, but the facts are always completely meh. Half the time they are completely fucking wrong about the conclusions that their l33t haxx0ring brings them to as well.

				I&#039;m really not arguing with any of your logic. But I am not getting into any discussions about CP.

				I only became aware of the existence of Anonymous in recent years, and I learned of and about them in much the same way I have discovered and taken an interest in other various individuals and/or organizations or what have you that were previously unknown to me.&nbsp; That is that I would be reading an article or watching a YouTube video on a particular subject that I&#039;m either curious about or more often a subject that I&#039;m very passionate about.&nbsp; A few years ago, someone very close to me became a victim of the so called &quot;justice system&quot;, which&nbsp; I soon found out [almost] first hand is anything but &quot;just&quot;, and ever since have been drawn to [non-mainstream] articles, websites, videos, etc... that highlight the overwhelming and increasing corruption and abuses of power in every level of establishment... from the local street cop to the highest publicly acknowledged level of federal government and probably even above/beyond that.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, it was while in parts of the Internet that directly dealt with the above mentioned subject, that I first discovered Anonymous.&nbsp; And when I did, I was very impressed (even though even at first glance it was obvious that&nbsp; w/o being too specific, they seem to be some years younger than myself), but the only side to them that I first saw was the one that was featured along side similar things I was viewing online that exposed or attempted to expose and inform about ... basically... government abuses of citizens.&nbsp; At the time, feeling discouraged and helpless against the powerful authoritarian entities that seem hell bent on destroying personal freedom, I felt hope in Anonymous... from the side of them I&#039;d seen, it appeared to me as if there was a group of people.. a lot of people who felt just like I did about the whole injustice of it all.. and while I couldn&#039;t do anything about it, I thought that maybe they could.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I took an interest and looked into them a bit more... saw videos of promises to &quot;expect us&quot; on this date or that date that had long passed by the time I found those videos, and I found a bunch of articles on them, etc..&nbsp; and then started feeling really stupid for having thought that they were a sign of hope and was soooo glad that I&#039;d not mentioned my initial thoughts on them to anyone as it had started to appear to me that they were little more than a bunch of script kiddies, probably in their teens w/ no real social skills, they apparently from what info I&#039;d found had found each other in the first place because they had basically one thing in common... misfits who thought that sick and often childish pics &amp; pranks were really funny, as was making prank phone calls, engaging in other disruptive behaviour...&nbsp; and getting more attention than they had probably ever had before... &quot;anonymously&quot;.<br /><br />O.K. those were my first two totally opposing views of Anonymous, both of which I&#039;d formed several years ago and within about a week of each other.&nbsp; Today... my view of them is generally quite positive.&nbsp; I get the feeling that as time has gone by, the political landscape has gone through some major changes, that they basically have grown up and taken notice of the danger we all could face of becoming true slaves to governments, unable to leave and without rights if government is left to continue on the path it&#039;s been on for much longer.&nbsp; Something that unfortunately, way too many people, some much older and better educated apparently are still oblivious to.&nbsp; I like the fact that they seemed to have realized early on that a society where everyone is equal and doesn&#039;t accept the idea of living by rules created by those who are in positions of authority by whatever means they got there to judge, to imprison, etc..&nbsp; is a better way of life for all but the relatively few who are in positions to control the ways of the world.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve noticed in more recent videos they no longer claim to be just hackers, but say to the effect that people who share their ideology don&#039;t need to know how to hack anything but can put to use whatever is their unique talent to work toward the same cause.&nbsp; &nbsp; And in even more recent videos, I&#039;ve noticed that now they have acknowledged that defacing websites, hacking emails and orchestrating ddos attacks on government computers has not brought about the desired change and that they will need to explore other avenues.&nbsp; For all those involved in a movement who&#039;s true goal is to affect positive change for all, I&#039;m behind them 100%.<br /><br />I also realize that a &quot;group&quot; (for lack of a better word) of people who insist that anyone and everyone is &quot;anonymous&quot;, is fertile ground for anyone who happens to be deranged to put on a Guy Fawkes mask (or not) and go on any sort of rampage they want and claim to have done it on behalf of Anonymous...&nbsp; &nbsp;and I suspect that there are a good number of people and groups/organizations around the world who have done and/or will do exactly that..&nbsp; for those people - especially those who&#039;s goal is to cause harm, I&#039;ve no support or sympathy.<br /><br />A final thought...&nbsp; without personally knowing who and how, if anyone at all was behind the recent public revelations of Edward Snowden to the mainstream media, it would appear that in an almost ironic twist, out of the blue comes one young man who managed to infiltrate and secure a high vantage point to be privy of the secrets of the most powerful surveillance machine in the world, seems to have managed in a matter of days to have at the very least, brought attention to the masses who depend on nothing but mainstream media as their source of &quot;news&quot; of the fact that they are also&nbsp; affected by this outrageous overreach of government.&nbsp; I suspect that his revelations have also changed the dynamics somewhat of the way various countries relate to the US as well, and I doubt that MasterCard having suddenly announced publicly that it will resume processing donations to WikiLeaks is a &quot;coincidnece&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;But to me, simply getting the masses to feel outrage at what has been going on is huge, as I don&#039;t believe that any kind of real change for the better can happen without the vast majority uniting together to oppose the few but very powerful.<br /><br />Actually, in my totally uninformed opinion, I kinda suspect that Snowen didn&#039;t come out of the blue at all, rather I wonder if he isn&#039;t very much intertwined with Anonymous and the only thing that sets him apart is that something happened to his mask....&nbsp; <br /><br />But in any case, Thumbs Up to any and all who are involved with working to restore our freedoms and prevent us from losing even more..

Not the part about them being ignorant and whatnot, the future lies with the proles because they are human. <br /><br />Probably should expect some serious amounts of George Orwell in here... <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />never read that book unfortunately.. im a big sci-fi fan but that was one i just never picked up..&nbsp; can you elaborate more??&nbsp; not like arguing, like, i am genuinely interested in what the similarities you see between anonymous and a group of people in a classic sci-fi riff.. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve never read it either, but it&#039;s a fairly well known book that at the time it was written, it was a futuristic story that was to take place in the year 1984 about the UK being a total police state, with things like that it would be mandatory for everyone to keep their TV&#039;s on so that the government could watch you through it, helicopters hovering outside windows to watch from there...&nbsp; &nbsp;and from what I gather, basically a story about a country under complete government control and surveillance.&nbsp; Thing is, it is seeming as if George Orwell&#039;s concept is actually coming true..&nbsp; in America.. almost exactly 30 years later than the date which is the title of the book, 1984.<br /><br />The correlation between Anonymous and 1984 would be that their latest project/message/warning seems to be that if the outrageous over reach and abuse of power by government isn&#039;t stopped soon, the surveillance that&#039;s going on now could well reach the full proportion that is supposedly described in the book and then it would be too late to do anything at all about it..&nbsp; best I could do w/o actually having read the book.....

				I concur with the general setinments here.<br />&#039;Anonymous&#039; are indeed mostly comprised of young script kiddies and most &#039;attacks&#039; simply involve having as many of said script kiddies run some third party packet flooding tools (just overload the server).<br />This can work in the sense of bringing the site down but I would be much more impressed if they managed to root a box on the servers network and pull out some &#039;secure&#039; data/sabotage the sites functionality in order to bring down some of these (worthy and well deserved in my opinion) targets systems.<br />It has been done a few times before but sadly knowadays most &#039;attacks&#039; are just as large a group of kids as possible effectively pinging a server to death. Little lame imho.<br />

				Being and staying Anonymous these days in this open leaked world is by far the best way to live life.&nbsp; Nobody can find anything out about you unless you leak yourself out

				Anonymous is and always will be about the lulz (laughing at someone else&#039;s expense.) All this moral faggotry and &quot;hacktivism&quot; is NOT anon. There are no leaders or spokespeople, it&#039;s a goddamn collective. It&#039;s called anonymous because people posting on *chan.org imageboards had their name default to anonymous if they didn&#039;t type one in when posting. It was often joked that anon was just one guy talking to himself. Back in the day anon was feared, while not all of us were leet haxors there was certainly more than a few badass coders and hackers who frequented the chans and irc channels/servers linked to them. &quot;None of us are as cruel as all of us.&quot; If the hivemind of anon picked you as its target, it was over. ED is still a great chronical of lulz gone by, much as that land whale girlvinyl tried to destroy it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />FREE WEEV
