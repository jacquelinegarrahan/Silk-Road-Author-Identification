				just curious as to everyone&#039;s answer, as someone fairly new here i&#039;m not 100% on the etiquette...<br /><br />what, in your mind/experience, qualifies a buyer to click that &quot;resolve&quot; link? (let&#039;s assume the non-arrival of goods as a given)

				If you haven&#039;t received the product in the time that the vendor outlined in the listing, then try to contact the vendor. If they don&#039;t reply in a couple off days. Click the resolve.<br /><br />If the auto finalize is about to count down to 0 and you still haven&#039;t received the product. Click the resolve.<br /><br />Just try your best to work things out with the vendor first

				Just to be safe, I wait 16.5 days, then resolve, and contact the vendor politely.&nbsp; Mail is slow sometimes, and vendors are people, so I usually give them the benefit of the doubt, and try to avoid bothering them if I can avoid it.&nbsp; Once you&#039;re in resolution, you can wait I guess indefinitely, to square things with your vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m sure you know but, avoid refunds if you can avoid it, and try to work things out outside of the SR transaction.&nbsp; That way you won&#039;t spike your refund rate.&nbsp; Many vendors will send coins or a gift code as a refund.<br /><br />But always be polite, understanding, and patient.

I repeat then. I hold off on the resolve for as long as possible. and always offer extensions to date in the resolution center .&nbsp;

				oh it put your order in the resolution center. Where you and the vender can ask for/accept extended delivery time, or refunds. <br />they put and extra 7 ay on the clock til SR sets in to resolve thing(never had that happen so don&#039;t know what happens then).<br /><br />Any mod or admin please feel free to correct if i said that wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;
