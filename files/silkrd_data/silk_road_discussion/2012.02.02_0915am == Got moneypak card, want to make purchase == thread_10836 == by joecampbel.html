				Okay me again... sorry about the lack of knowledge but i&#039;ve been searching all over the place for a way to get bitcoins into my SR account and have gone as far as to buy a Moneypak card...&nbsp; After spending a couple hours searching, i thought i&#039;d just post this and maybe someone can help.&nbsp; What site or url is the best deal for moneypak to bitcoin?&nbsp; After that what do I do?&nbsp; Download the app at the site?&nbsp; Then should I also download a sort of ewallet program?&nbsp; Is is this neccesary?&nbsp; Anyone else going to walmart and buying GreenDot moneypak cards to do your business?&nbsp; If so can you give me a step by step with links? or urls etc...?&nbsp; I have been told &quot;sugar momma&quot; but found nothing.&nbsp; Thanks again!<br /><br />

				Get-Bitcoin.com, which by the way is a pretty great site with a variety of options to purchase BitCoins, claims that it will start accepting MoneyPaks in the future (January 2012, which is now of course since past), but currently do not. Very possible other sites do, although from what I understand the government is cracking down on these cards and making them harder to use.<br /><br />My one piece of advice is do not use the card to buy something here. Some vendors will let you pay them by putting the proper amount on the card and then giving them the number. While this is theoretically a quick method it is easier to trace the cash, and you are also left with no protection. There is nothing to prevent the vendor from walking off with your cash, and no way to get a refund through SR. I have been ripped off myself from a vendor who at the time was very trusted, so you can&#039;t ever be sure. That being said, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a common option any more, and certainly there are vendors who have used it honestly, but why take the risk? Escrow is your friend. :)<br /><br />Any way, good luck with getting your BitCoins--it takes a while to figure out but gets easier and is definitely the best route to go.

				BTCpal will always do you right and give you a whole lot more money than the other big vendors. Times have been hard this week for the mp to btc trade. I would place an order for BTCpal right now and hope you get it by Saturday. I would not expect it til Sunday.

				It took me a couple days to get my MP&#039;s exchanged. SR can be an exercise in frustration waiting for btc, waiting for the site to load, and waiting for the mail to come. I want what I want and I want it now! SR has turned me into a more patient addict. ;)<br /><br />I gave my codes to BTCpal, BTC Buddy, BTCKing, and Sugar Moma. None of them ripped me off, but BTCKing doesn&#039;t do MP anymore and Sugar Mama is really busy. BTC Buddy or BTCpal are your best bet right now. I just send them the numbers in a message or in the address box when I place an order. They eventually get cashed. <br /><br />Luckily, I&#039;ve never been ripped off. A former btc exchanger who I trusted scammed customers for thousands of dollars. Don&#039;t spend more than you can afford to lose.
