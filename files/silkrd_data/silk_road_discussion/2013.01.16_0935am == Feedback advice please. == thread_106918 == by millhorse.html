				I&#039;m pretty new on the road, 2 or 3 months, and in that time there seems to have been a shift in attitude from &quot;if you leave a feedback of less than 5 stars for a seller it&#039;s the same as a 1 star rating, and if you&#039;re new you could be blacklisted and guys won&#039;t sell to you&quot;, to more of a &quot;use the feedback system for feedback, same as you would on Ebay or anywhere else&quot;.<br /><br />Two recent purchases I made have been finalized but I&#039;m considering what to do before rating and leaving feedback.<br /><br />1. An order of supposedly 120mg Tramadol caps. I noticed there seemed to be a huge variance in effect from pill to pill but initially thought it was me, i.e. tiredness, anxiety, full/empty stomach etc. etc. but some pills would have zero effect and the odd one would hit me like a ton of bricks. These pills came in a blister pack. They are generic but branded from Africa with a company name I can find little or no info about. Eventually my suspicions got the better of me so I busted out the scales and weighed some of the caps. <br />Lo and behold there was a difference of about 60 mg between the lightest one and the heaviest one. If memory serves, the range was about 210mg to 270mg a cap. Pretty shitty manufacturing standards I think you&#039;d agree.<br />Should I leave my feedback reflecting the quality of the product I got? Or just on the transaction with the seller?<br />(As it happens, this order also took almost 4 weeks to arrive)<br /><br />2. I ordered a couple of Tapentadol tablets to try. These were listed as genuine pills coming from a blister pack but that they would be removed from the blister for stealth when shipping. I&#039;ve no problem with that. My 3 pills arrived and on inspection there were no marks at all to identify them, as you would expect to find on genuine pharms. Also, 2 of the 3 had score lines on one side but one had none. Finally, on one of the scored pills, the line was off centre. I have seen many better made extacy pills than these. I haven&#039;t tried them yet but I&#039;m not inspired with confidence so far. I expected better for â‚¬6 a pill.<br />Again, should my feedback reflect the above? Given that the listing states genuine meds. Also bear in mind that tapentadol is not off patent yet so there are no generic &quot;genuine&quot; pills.
