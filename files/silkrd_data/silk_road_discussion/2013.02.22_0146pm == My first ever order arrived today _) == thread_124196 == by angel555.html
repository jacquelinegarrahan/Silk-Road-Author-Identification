His stuff used to be great, then went downhill. He recently went on a vacation and had someone filling in for him. During that time, product got even worse, and some of his customers complained. When he paid me a visit, he said &quot;we got some complaints on quality while I was gone, sorry about that, this stuff is much better&quot;. At that point, I told him about SR. As I was talking, I started feeling uneasy so spinned it that I was telling him about it so he could sell his stuff there. He had no idea. Now he does. Bought off of him another time afterwords, and the product was shit. So, lesson wasn&#039;t learned&nbsp; :-\

				<br />Isn&#039;t your first arrival just spectacular!<br /><br />All the reading, downloading, Bitcoins and all the processes you go through.......and at the end of it is a little reward....wow!<br /><br />But, it&#039;s not the end...just the start.<br /><br />Talk about positive reinforcement.<br /><br />Have more safe and happy travels........and don&#039;t forget to alert your vendors to the new shipping stealth that can be found as the first &#039;sticky&#039; in the shipping forum on this board.<br />
