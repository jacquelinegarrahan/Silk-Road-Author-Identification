				Yeah I have to give credit to the orginal source Sickgirl brought this to our attention in the Rumormill, the entire Meth vendor review thread is gone and wiped a bunch of our post and i got a demotion to Junior member. Sucks by the way can someone kill or ban that shitcunt ThisisBullshit who keeps posted flaming offensive garbage. I don&#039;t know if he&#039;s serious or he has a terrible sense of humor but either way its incredibly annoying

				I still think the problem is that they fucked up migration of the database... Maybe since Obfuscator no longer exists as an account, when it couldn&#039;t find the thread starter it just choked and didn&#039;t copy the entire thread.<br /><br />... can&#039;t think of a reason Nomad wouldn&#039;t have been a mod a week ago though.&nbsp; Maybe nobody&#039;s a mod anymore, and they forget to re-enable the privileges?&nbsp; Oh whatever, not like I could do anything about it even if I&#039;m right.&nbsp; I love SR, I really do... but fuck man.&nbsp; This sloppy administration is beginning to put even me off.
