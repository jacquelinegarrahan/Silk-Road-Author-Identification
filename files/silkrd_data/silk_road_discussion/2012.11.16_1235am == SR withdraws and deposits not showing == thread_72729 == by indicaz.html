				Ok so yesterday I made a few deposits and 1 showed while the other did not show<br /><br />Today I attempted to withdraw 20.57 btc&nbsp; and a second withdraw of .57 btc and <br />After 5 hours although the first withdraw of 20.57 btc is confirmed 19 times in block explorer there is no indication or deposit made to the receive address <br /><br />Withdraw appear to be going somewhere however it appears they are not going to the indicated withdraw account<br /><br />Now before someone chimes in and says but her the coins are tumbled<br /><br />I understand this however&nbsp; many others are complaining of the same thing<br /><br />Also I see people complaining of the inability to buy<br /><br />I am a hit concerned that perhaps out money is being sent to a account when we withdraw other then the indicated account withdraws are supposed to be sent to<br /><br />Is it possible that this could happen? Such as someone hard coding into the script a btc address to send all deposits and withdraws to when we enter our pins?<br /><br />This is really pissing me off... I have attempted to notify support with absolutely no response from them.<br /><br />Anyone else have concerns or experiencing anything similar<br /><br />I also noticed the deposit I made yesterday earlier was showing a unconfirmed in the block explorer but now has disappeared all together.<br /><br />Wtf is goin on
