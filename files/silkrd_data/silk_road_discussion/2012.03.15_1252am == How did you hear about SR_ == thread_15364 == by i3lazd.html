				SR came to me in a dream. In this dream there was no war, no sickness and no hunger. And you could get drugs sent to your house for a reasonable fee. I&#039;m glad one of the elements of that dream bled into reality. Now I&#039;m sure the others can too. ;D<br /><br />~from the meadow, goatHerd

				Initially i was furious at the gawker article - but it did bring in a nice range of sellers - but i reckon that would have happened anyway.<br />I remember that fucking dickhead saying he wanted to publish the article on his blog and loads of ppl here told him not to fucking do it - but he did.<br />Then places like reddit - which is just over-run by morons who think they&#039;re particularly intelligent becos theyr anal about spelling on the internet - got hold of it and an influx of idiots.

				A long time ago, late one evening, a sallow faced man arrived on my stoop. This man was a salesman, of sorts. When he told me this, I asked what he sold. Then, from the folds of his coat, he pulled out a book, unnoticed by me at first, far too large and conspicuous to be concealed where from it came. He then said, &quot;Only this,&quot; and placed it on to the table, silently. I refused to buy it before he even offered a price. He bowed as he left, book in hand.<br />In the morning, after breakfast, I did my normal bathing. When I returned from the shower room, I went to the kitchen for a drink. I passed through the dining room, past the table where I had just consumed my eggy weggs. I poured my self some leftover coffee from breakfast and returned to the dinig room. And that&#039;s when I noticed it.<br />There, where I has just eaten my morning meal, on the table I just passed by without a second glance, precisely where it was laid the previous night, was that book. Larger than your average dictionary and older than the oldest bible you&#039;ve ever seen. I was afraid to touch it. And I let it sit there.<br />That is, at least, until curiosity got the better of me, as it always does. I touched it with just two fingers, and when nothing happened, I picked it up. Then I opened with oh so much care. The first page was blank, except for a tiny &quot;0&quot; in the righthand corner. I turned the page. And then it was nonsense. Letters in no particular order with random spaces and punctuation. And the page number wasn&#039;t &quot;1&quot;, like it should have been, it was some binary garbage: 1001010100 or something as equally unintelligible. I turned the page again, and it was more of the same, only the page number was in roman numerals this time. I was getting frustrated, and very, very confused.<br />Opening the book to a random page only made the confusion deepen. For on it was scribbles this tim. And turning back to the page that should have been &quot;1&quot; revealed that the nonsense page with the binary page number had been replaced by a few lines of mysterious poetry and the page number &quot;575&quot;.<br /><br />Along these lines of time<br />We are building a new path<br />Into the future<br /><br />After reading this I closed the book and put ti away. For years, it stayed closed and on a shelf, far out of mind. One day recently I&nbsp; was just going about my business when the thought of that book struck me. I resisted the temptation to open it again for a time, but the sway of my curiosity won out, again.<br />I opened it somewhere in the middle. On the left page was a tutorial and instructions on how to use TOR. The right page was utterly blank except for a single line of text at the center of the page. An onion address:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br />I&#039;ve since put the book away in a safe and secret place. I don&#039;t know what other mysteries it holds, but I&#039;m thankful enough for this one to call it good.<br /><br />-sSh-

				I was looking for LSD. I was told LSD would find me.<br /><br />Completely unrelated, I got interested in Bitcoin pretty early on, back when you couldn&#039;t really buy anything with them yet. Then I started searching for things to do with them, and the Silk Road popped up :) So I wasn&#039;t even looking for drugs, I guess LSD really does find you.

				I was bored out of my mind, and on 4chan (toilet of the internet), when i saw a post about tor network and silkroad. I remember i previously downloaded tor and thought it was shit. I left it alone and never used it. Then at the last part of the post it mentioned silk road. So i spent a whole day of research on the internet how to get into silkroad and how it works. I spent a day downloading btc blocks, and did all the account crap and here i was. I nearly jerked off into the sun when i saw the cannabis section. Two weeks later i got some hash in the mail :P.

				Some Livejournal post where an author blatantly accused Tor of all the sins in the world, such as CP, weapon trading and drugs trading. One of the screenshots clearly displayed SR address at the URL bar. So it took me a month starting from that very dear moment when I entered this address to the moment I stockpiled SR orders at around $700.

				I was actually doing research for a download accelerator I had recently found named polipo. <br /><br />I stumbled across an article on a clear net website describing the dark net and its relating enterprises. The actual website address was listed in the post so I quickly downloaded tor and began browsing.<br /><br />It took a little research and a lot of nerve to began browsing the tor network but I quickly caught on. I joined the blackmarket forums first and then joined silk road.<br /><br />So far I have been really impressed.

There are many ways.<br /><br />You can do a wire transfer to an exchange like www.MtGox.com. You then buy bitcoins from them and withdraw to your wallet/silk road address.<br /><br />Alternatively you can use www.bitinstant.com, and actually go into a bank (US only) to deposit cash, and they will then send the money to your MtGox account (there are other options for where the money is sent). You don&#039;t need to give ID to deposit cash into their bank account. <br /><br />Alternatively you can buy a moneypak, or use Western Union/Moneygram and send money to one of the sellers here on Silk Road who will then give you bitcoins. <br /><br />For Western Union/Moneygram I recommend googleyed (however he does have $250 minumum) : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/54a632d70b<br /><br />And for moneypak BTC Buddy is a good choice: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e59c5af70b<br /><br />However you do need 0.02 to buy that listing. If you decide to buy that one, message me and I will send you the 0.02 so you can get started.<br /><br />

I started posting and someone mentioned Tor, and then after the mention of that, another person said &quot;I had to get Tor to get on the silk road&quot; ...it was all rather confusing. So I googled Tor and silk road. And here I am. Awesome community.. I hope I can get some of what I need on here. Drug dealers in real life are &quot;on their way&quot; when they are just about to jump in the shower or their houses are about to be raided by the popo because 24 different people come by to &quot;visit&quot; every afternoon.

				I heard it from the same guy who vowed to take this site down--Sen. Charles Ellis Schumer, D-NY. <br /><br />A few years back, his office &quot;leaked&quot; a memo that was detrimental to a certain company that our investment club owned. Such a crooked move. Always cringed when I would see his face on TV since that episode. Well last summer, Google News had a headline with his name on it, so I clicked on it. There he was sitting in front of his computer with the Silk Road homepage on his monitor:<br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Senator Charles Schumer is asking federal authorities to shut down a secretive narcotics market operated online with anonymous sales and untraceable currency.<br /><br />Heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines are among the drugs being sold in the well-protected website apparently operating for just a few months. It was made public by Gawker and news media reports several days ago.<br /><br />&quot;Literally, it allows buyers and users to sell illegal drugs online, including heroin, cocaine, and meth, and users do sell by hiding their identities through a program that makes them virtually untraceable,&quot; Schumer said at a news conference Sunday. &quot;It&#039;s a certifiable one-stop shop for illegal drugs that represents the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen. It&#039;s more brazen than anything else by lightyears.&quot;<br /><br />Even more amazing, said Schumer, is that users rate their delivery performance and the quality of the drug on the site.<br /><br />The website uses a complex Internet configuration that allows the users to remain anonymous and untraceable by downloading the program TOR. Users can then log on to the site and hide their IP addresses so that neither the buyer nor the seller knows who they&#039;re dealing with.<br /><br />To make sure the money exchanged can&#039;t be traced, the site uses a new digital currency called Bitcoins that can be purchased online by visitors, according to Schumer. Using real money, users purchase these Bitcoins, which can be traded at roughly $9 to one bitcoin, and use them as proxy for real money when they buy things on Silk Road.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s an online form of money laundering used to disguise the source of money, and to disguise who&#039;s both selling and buying the drug,&quot; said Schumer.<br /><br />Once purchased, sellers are advised to ship the drugs in vacuum-sealed packs to make sure the packages aren&#039;t detected from the likes of drug-sniffing dogs and other narcotics surveillance. <br /><br />Schumer said it was crucial for DEA and Department of Justice to shut down the site immediately now that is public.<br /><br />&quot;The DEA has confirmed they are aware of the site, and while they won&#039;t confirm or deny that an investigation is underway, from my years of experience, I&#039;d bet my bottom dollar in this instance there is one underway,&quot; he said.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />So if it wasn&#039;t for him, I would never have found it.

				Hey all, new member here and thought this was an appropriate first post :P .<br /><br />A few weeks ago there was a live DnB / Dubstep event going on in this city, and we were late picking up our MDMA so when I called my regular guy it was all gone (as a result of this major event). We couldn&#039;t see our favorite dub artists watching everyone around us hard rolling, so we had to get hold of some and that guy is the only (good) MD dealer I know here.<br /><br />We ended up getting a number off our neighbors and this guy was all out too, we ended up working down a chain of number after number for about an hour and 5 spliffs or more until finally we found someone who had some, sounded genuine and could drop off. When he got here and was weighing it out he started banging on about this &quot;top secret&quot; site you can buy any drug off of. Obviously he wasn&#039;t going to tell us (he would&#039;ve wanted our repeat custom). When he mentioned that &quot;it&#039;s not on the internet its on this anonymous ting&quot; I asked him if he was talking about Tor (I&#039;m no newbie when it comes to the internet) and he knew I was going to find it and shut up about it, haha.<br /><br />I can tell you one thing for sure, a lot of dealers don&#039;t want people to know about this site.<br /><br />I only actually bothered to search for it yesterday and found it after no more than 5 minutes. I&#039;m very happy to see that the sources I get my weed from are as good if not better strains/prices than on this site, which I&#039;m very happy about :), so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be buying my weed here unless theirs some proper rare strains or sick deals. However, MDMA, MXE I will definitely be buying. Fucking cracking deals on those chems here.<br /><br />Think I&#039;ll make my first order (MXE) sometime this week.<br />Also nice community you have here :), forums seem very active and ass-hattery doesn&#039;t seem too common. :P<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />EDIT:<br />p.s. Any (non-obvious please) tips for a first time buyer? I&#039;ve not been off the internet researching this website since I found it, so I know the basics (and probably more).

				My search for SR started 4 years ago when I took my first toke of mj through an apple. Since then, I&#039;ve been very interested in drugs (not addicted) and started reading up on everything I could find about them. Fast forward to March this year and after reading 100&#039;s of articles on erowid, the nexus, and BL, I discovered TOR. It was very much a snowball effect after that. I got into TOR and found that anything could be traded through it so I was like, &quot;I wonder if I could buy weed and have it shipped to me?&quot; Well, here I am in June, reminiscing about being a kid in a candy store the day I first logged on.

				I had a tech friend who was balls deep in 4chan and stuff tell me all about it. I was far too skeptical to take the plunge though... however, upon traveling the burner scene (flipside, alchemy, lakes of fire, etc) i began meeting other nomadic burners who couldn&#039;t rely upon local connects for their substance as they were never a &quot;local&quot; to any scene in particular for any extended period of time. They all got their fix from the SR! This immediately turned me onto the legitimacy of the site and i&#039;ve been excited to participate ever since! :)
