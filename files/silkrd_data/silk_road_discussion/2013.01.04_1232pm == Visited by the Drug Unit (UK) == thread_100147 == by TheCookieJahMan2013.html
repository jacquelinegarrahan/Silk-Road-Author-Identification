				this forum has been made to clear my name &quot;thecookiejahman&quot; about this police turning up incident. if you are unaware of this then my apology for wasting your time (may be worth a read anyway) <br /><br />Some idiot called &quot;roger&quot; made a forum saying some Bullshit story about police turning upto his house &quot;days after the packaged arrived&quot; after 3000 views and a load of comments it does seem that people see though this lie and are still more than happy to buy our products as our feedback has been through the roof and all we literally feel this &quot;roger&quot; guy is, is a rival vendor trying to destroy our 100%feedback and delivery rate (and well he has destroyed it tbh) what a shame yes i know. the forum was posted last month under the same subject name but i had only realised when a customer told me about it the other day. <br /><br />although just increasing our customer bases through using the forums now, all roger has done in this incident is infuriate me personally to the max and i just wanted to make everyone aware of this retards plans just so this matter can come to an end. <br /><br />since writing a comment myself (seem below) roger has not said a word and has actually only wrote 3 comments blagging this endless story even further. <br /><br />please have a read and say your thoughts...<br /><br />if you would like to check out our profile its on http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/760664bfe<br /><br />much luv and regards<br /><br />thecookiejahman<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />You cheeky little bstard! how dare you sit there and lie to us all about the police came to your house.&nbsp; how dare you!!<br /><br />i just had a loyal customer tell me about your &quot;forum&quot; and i still cant believe your saying that the police they &quot;found a parcel which they knew had mdma in it&quot; and they still sent it to your house and then they just popped around a few days later to say hello and to ask you where you got it from...&quot;lol&quot;.... how ridiculous!! it upsets me to think that all you are is a rival vendor just trying to destroy our reputation! or just a complete idiot! why would you even tell them any kind of information on SR in the slightest! thats jepodising everyones money not just ours! thats the reason why we wrote the note &quot;hope you enjoy our &quot;SURPRISE!!&quot;so if anyone did get caught you could say you dont have a clue who sent it and you dont know nothin about it!!&quot; but obviously you wasnt quick enough to realise that and pretty much wet yourself and told the coppers everything...<br /><br />Sorry fellow SilkRoaders outraged isnt the word...just for everyones information, yes me and a few friends have started selling mdma on SR (some of the nicest stuff we&#039;ve had in years btw) we started just to pretty much breakeven and smoke our selves to paradise to be honest with you all. (as everyone must know these days a nice bit of weed is more expensive than GOLD these days. we have NO intentions to scam or mislead anybody and tbf we have been ever so happy with all of our feedback which has done nothin else but encourage us to carry on selling.<br /><br />We so far have had a 100% feedback with 100% deliverys arrive to all of our destinations, overseas and locally (impart from this simpleton who gave us 1/5 and didnt even inbox none of us about this disturbance) what a shame yes i know but its even more upsetting to read this we promise you.<br /><br />Please all note that this must be a lie! if it isnt why didnt this moron message us personally and tell us about this whole incident so we could amend it so it could never happen in the future.<br /><br />For all future customers, we have bought alot of new equipment (even before seeing this forum) and we are going to start vaccum packing everything, and seccuring our packages even more with some different methods we know will succeed in getting to you in one piece. Please do have a look at our profile and have a look at our products and message us at any time for any questions.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/760664bfe8<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />TheCookieJahMan<br /><br />&nbsp;8) 8) 8)
