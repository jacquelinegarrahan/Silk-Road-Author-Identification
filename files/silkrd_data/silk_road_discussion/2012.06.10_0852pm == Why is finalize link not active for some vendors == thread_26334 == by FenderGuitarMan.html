				Hi, I placed a bunch of orders on Friday. Some were marked in transit and the finalize link was available immediately. Others are marked in transit and the finalize link is just text, not a link. Can someone explain why? How do you know which situation applies to a given vendor?

				New vendors maybe?&nbsp; It&#039;s protection for you so you don&#039;t get scammed, but if you&#039;re FE&#039;ing you&#039;re going to get scammed.&nbsp; Have fun be safe!

				Try hovering your mouse over the text part. Should pop up saying how much time left until finalize button is active or something along that lines. =)

I believe vendors must meet certain requirements in order for customers too finalize early. I think finalizing early can be a bad choice but in many cases it may be the only case and there are many vendors that honestly just need people that finalize soon.

				Thanks all. The hover option is nice, I hadn&#039;t seen that. <br /><br />On FE: I&#039;m a new user and many of the most trusted vendors here require FE for first few buys. I have done it with a couple vendors such as Vicodin and received my orders very promptly. I should be at the point where I no longer am required to FE as I&#039;ve made ~8 purchases.<br /><br />The vendor is Oppyate and he/she has very high ratings (100) and I have communicated over PM. It&#039;s a relatively small BTC amount. I do appreciate all the advice and in general agree don&#039;t FE but in this case I took a calculated risk.<br /><br />If I get scammed it will be shame on me! But also be sure I&#039;ll post it all over the forums here to make sure it doesn&#039;t happen to someone else. I&#039;ll bet money (I guess I already did!) that this one works out fine.
