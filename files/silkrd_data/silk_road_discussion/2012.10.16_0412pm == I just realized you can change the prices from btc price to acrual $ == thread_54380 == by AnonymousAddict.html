				I know I&#039;m gonna take the -1 but wait until you realize that not posting every single piece of shit that goes through your head is much more amazing than what you&#039;ve found out now.<br /><br />Stop spamming the forum, it&#039;s an amazing community with lots of useful information. Unfortunately, the amount of stupidity in some of the threads makes me feel sad that I&#039;m a human being sometimes.

				dont be an asshole, this is a forum which means anyone is free to post what they want to talk about.<br /><br />in regards to the BTC to $ switch, I found that out a little while to.<br />i wonder if it will change correctly, as the price of BTC is constantly changing. I just left mine that way it was

				I had it set to BTC for a month then realized I could switch back to $. I switched it back to BTC and seeing the dollars for a day.&nbsp; Something about it was much more &quot;real&quot; lol.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that&#039;s good for some people, not so much for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;OR maybe I got so used to thinking in BTC, iono.

				You don&#039;t understand because there is no reason to criticize you.<br /><br />Someone tries to post information that may be helpful and gets called stupid for the trouble?<br /><br />Also people saying &quot;how could you not see that&quot; don&#039;t know dick about UI design.&nbsp; I have sat in usability labs where a group of people watched people using software from behind a mirror.&nbsp; On the top or bottom of the screen they would add text like &quot;Look under your seat to find a $100 bill&quot;.&nbsp; Sure as shit most people didn&#039;t look at it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=54380.msg528535#msg528535">Quote from: AnonymousAddict on October 17, 2012, 01:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Listen i dont understand some of you guys with the negative comments, I just never botherd to go and mess with my account settings, never needed too, But Im not gonna even come back to you with a remark, So if it makes me dumb that i had never messed with my account setting and didnt know then i guess i am..lol..

				I&#039;m not positive, but this feature wasn&#039;t always there, was it? I could&#039;ve sworn it&#039;s only been an option for like 3-4 months. If i&#039;m correct, people in before it was an option may not have realized it was a new feature later on. Then again, I could be mistaken and maybe it&#039;s always been there and only seemed new to me because I&#039;d never noticed it until that point&nbsp; :o lol. <br /><br />Anyway, I actually use it for when I&#039;m just browsing the road in general since I don&#039;t have to convert anything mentally. When I&#039;m actually buying I switch it to coins simply because if my wallet is coins and my order is coins its easier for me if I see the prices in coins. To each his own, I suppose. Plus I despise seeing the &quot;$&quot; in general. Pure evil.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sweat it OP. I didn&#039;t see it as spam. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a lot of folks that simply overlooked the feature.
