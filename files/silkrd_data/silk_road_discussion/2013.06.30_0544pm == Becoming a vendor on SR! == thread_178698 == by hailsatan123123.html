				Hey ive been thinking of becoming a vendor on Silkroad offering legal items i have for example<br />Digital watches , Scales , Vending supplies like bags and packaging merch , And gambling service <br /><br />Is it worth the 5.2btc&nbsp; to sell those items ? would it actually make any profit and if their is any demand for these things ? Is their any limitation on a number of items you can offer? Would it work for selling second hand items i got laying around the house ?

				Sure you&#039;d make a profit but honestly selling them on the clearnet would probably bring in more profit.

				I&#039;d be interested lol.&nbsp; I need a good scale, thousandths.&nbsp; You&#039;d probably make money, sure, and you could sell some products on the clear to increase your customer base (don&#039;t sell exactly the same wares and don&#039;t link yourself to SR, though).&nbsp; In any case, it&#039;s a good crew to be a part of.

				The problem with selling vending supplies is that you are asking vendors to expose themselves, even if indirectly.

				What most people don&#039;t take into consideration when entering the Road as a vendor is the cost of withdrawing BTC. Do some research and figure out how much it costs to turn your BTC into USD and you may realize the margins are too thin for it to be worth entering the market.
