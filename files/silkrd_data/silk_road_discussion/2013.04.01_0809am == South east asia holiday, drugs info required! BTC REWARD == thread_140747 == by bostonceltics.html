				Heading to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam soon.<br /><br />Can anyone give me information about the drug scene, I wont be buying off the street unless its a white guy maybe.<br /><br />What are the chemists like? Id be keen on valium and something to party on, like ritalin?&nbsp; <br />Heading to full moon party so something for that would be nice but not necessary, getting old so find it hard to just drink 5 days straight now.<br />I hear speed pills are available? mdma and coke would be best but doubt there is much around there?<br /><br />Will give the person with the most helpful info 0.09 btc :D<br /><br />Feel free to pm too. <br /><br /><br />

				Lucky you, heading off. You will have a great time in South East Asia; first off, in the big cities, be VERY careful who you trust. I can&#039;t say that enough. Pharmacies etc. will hand out valium, viagara etc no hassle at all, but i&#039;d recommend sourcing other drugs far away from cities in the more rural areas.<br /><br />A few years ago, a friend of mine was in Bangkok and a taxi drivers asked him if he wanted some hash. He was delighted to hear of the hash as he is a very keen smoker. So, the taxi driver made a quick phone call and within 15 minutes, my friend had about an ounce of hash in his hand. Anyway, they were driving around and my friend noticed they were going the wrong direction for where he was headed to. A couple of minutes later, there was a Police checkpoint and my friend got searched and arrested for the hash. The taxi driver had arranged for this search and my friend had to bribe the police with a lot of money (Thailand is notoriously strict with their drug laws). Presumably, the taxi driver got a cut of the bribe money. It was a lot of hassle for my friend and the expense of it wasn&#039;t only out of his own pocket, which was a pain in the arse, as he had to explain his situation to his family. By the way, I am not trying to scare monger you or anything like that. I am just giving you a heads up to have your wits about you.<br /><br />If you are into shrooms, I would highly recommend trying them in Thailand. They are really good quality and fairly freely available in the form of milkshakes in places where full moon parties etc will be held. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really have much other advice for you, but I hope you have the time of your life over there. You&#039;ll be blown away by the whole place :)
