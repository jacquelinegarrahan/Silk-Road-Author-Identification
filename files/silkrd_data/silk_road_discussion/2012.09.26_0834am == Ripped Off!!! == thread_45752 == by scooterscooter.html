				Do you ever get that sinking feeling that you&#039;ve been ripped off!<br /><br />Hi guys, I only have a couple of purchases under my belt. I ordered more coins on Friday evening, now i know it was going struggle over sat/sun but i would have thought come Monday it would have been &quot;full steam ahead&quot; guess not.<br />All the status reads is processing.<br />They&#039;ve had all the information they need; account address number and amount requested.<br />They then asked for voucher number, so they can release the funds.<br />Did that, and its been over 24hrs and i still haven&#039;t received my coins.<br />Am i being impatient, or is the vendor (who will remain nameless for now, just in case it wasn&#039;t their fault) taking the piss?!?!<br />I really would appreciate some advise?<br />

				It&#039;s probably just taking awhile, changing currencies to btc can be a real pain. I&#039;d give it another day and just keep in contact with the vendor. Hope it goes well.

				Why are people buying coins off SR still? Seriously there are plenty of safer, yet still more than anonymous enough methods out there. Plenty of places accepting cash over the counter bank deposits.

				I&#039;m waiting for my Bitcoin wallet to sync with the network, but I&#039;m hoping to use bitinstant and just go to the Bank of America and make a deposit. BTC from bitinstant seem pretty expensive though and it annoys me that they take money off the top...but yeah most sites take some major banks and walmart and shit!

				I can&#039;t speak for people outside the US, but I don&#039;t know why anyone within the states wouldn&#039;t use BitInstant.&nbsp; From the moment I ordered through bitinstant to the moment I handed my cash to the lady at WalMart, it took maybe 25 minutes to be in my instawallet.&nbsp; All completely anonymously, and with out the risk of being ripped off.&nbsp; I had the coins in my SR wallet probably 2 hours after I deposited the cash at Wal-Mart

				I simply thought it would be OK. The first time i bought some from &quot;the road&quot; it was so quick, simple, friendly, and efficient it seemed perfect. It gave me no reason to doubt next time.<br />I thought we were all here for the same thing. fast and friendly service for things you can&#039;t buy legally, and make a few sheckles along the way. win win.<br />No honour amongst thieves eh.<br />

				I can relate to you I was robbed 9 btc along with other peeps but since I finalized early at the request of the vendor, who had damn near perfect rating along with 100 transactions...live and learn.&nbsp; I was fucking pissed for about 3 weeks though.&nbsp; And also when I had acid shipped overseas that never made it which is odd because about 30 other heads were missing there orders and acid cant be detected all it is a piece of paper.&nbsp; Oh my that was great acid! so clean and mindblowing..I don&#039;t know if it was the vendors fault or not but it sucked... doesn&#039;t matter it&#039;s history.<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s a fucked up feeling, especially when it happens over and over all the anger builds up. There was a time when I would become depressed and chalk it up as a loss, whether it was fake product at night or fronting the money.... And I consider myself&nbsp; non violent but I have terrible anger issues. Especially when it comes to false pretenses who&#039;ll rip you off at the drop of a hat.&nbsp; It&#039;s one thing if you loan someone $20 and they never pay you back.&nbsp; It&#039;s another to get all your hopes shot down and steal medications that someone uses for pain, spiritual, recreational purposes or when thieves rob your tools out of the back of your truck that I used to make a living with. I&#039;m generally a chill and mellow person and I hate violence.&nbsp; Years of my hard earned money being ganked has turned me bitter and callous towards them. Even if I get my ass kicked I won&#039;t back down from anyone who does it again because seeing them beaten to a pulp on the ground or their car windows smashed out with sledge hammers and cinder blocks is worth every penny.&nbsp; Same thing with cops if I ever have them come into my house I will waste everyone of them even though I die...ill die knowing I took a few pigs out with me.&nbsp; Who were really just doing their job but what a shitty job to be in especially when you get pumped full of holes. Same thing if anyone tries to hurt my family or try to fuck my friends.&nbsp; You see what the war on drugs does to people?&nbsp; They want to declare war on our personal freedoms then they must prepare to die for it.&nbsp; But I digress.<br /><br />&nbsp;But once you&#039;ve been ripped off so many times one can only take so much before you snap.&nbsp; The mental anguish of being ripped, having all your hopes shot down and having thousands of dollars go out the window when you&#039;re struggling to begin with only to have some worthless sack of shit burn you can tear your spirit to pieces.&nbsp; <br /><br />silk road is a god send.&nbsp; I would be dead right now if it wasn&#039;t for silk road.&nbsp; Because someone will either shoot me and they better put a bullet through my head because I will cast them out without hesitation.&nbsp; There is no excuse for this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done every drug there is and I was strung out on heroin and coke for years while dealing to friends on the side and if I was in withdrawals I&#039;d man up and tough it <br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t play these games when it comes to dealing with thieves who rob for their next fix.&nbsp; I stopped playing games in HS when I gave a this douche $30 for some weed and he kept making excuses about his mother flushing it down the toilet yad yada I knew it was bs. The this fucker had the audacity to tell me &quot;you play in the game you get played&quot; I said nothing went home next day waited until after school and decked him to the ground.&nbsp; Needless to say, he never ripped me off again.&nbsp; On the contrary he got a cinder block threw the back of his windshield along with a sledgehammer and his car spray painted.....he stole $50 worth of weed and now he got played....&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;This last time I was jipped on $120 of coke I had been ripped off so many times before I could not endure anymore pain. all my anger boiling through my veins, and adrenaline pumping out my ears.... i finally just went ballistic and threw a flying elbow punch at the coke dealer and him out in one punch and seeing this fat sack of shit who stole my money covered in blood was worth every penny. <br />I do not play games anymore when it comes to people ripping me off. After years of getting jipped one starts to bottle anger.<br />&nbsp;cause what will you do call the cops about stolen drug money? I hate dealing with those type of ppl. I think it was my first order so i was clueless about the finalizing early rule and&nbsp; Because I finalized early and trusted the worthless waste of o2 since he had almost perfect feedback with 100 transactions.....but you live and learn it sucks but not shit you can do about it once you finalize early its in their hands. I&#039;ve been jipped thousands of dollars not here on the road but IRL because despite all things I thought there were good ppl in this world but they are idiots just trying to score for a fix themselves.&nbsp; All my friends who use psychedelics and weed have always gave me great deals and delivered and it&#039;s right on the money every time.<br /><br />On the other hand trying to cop drugs on the street has always been a nightmare especially in the area i live in... i&#039;ve been burned brutally bad and i&#039;m talking thousands of dollars.&nbsp; It was partially my fault for being so naive and hanging out in shady places I had no business in. And trusting people who I thought were my friends but stab me in the back every chance they get another knife slices my throat.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It&#039;s much safer to order here than the street... the one thing that pisses me off about the road is the prices of some opiates are insanely high, gotta wait in agonizing pain for package to arrive, have to go through the trouble of getting moneypaks and BTCs.&nbsp; But its worth it to be able to have goods delivered strictly to your door and not have to wait for the dealer to drag ass.&nbsp; The mail man on the other hand is never late. He&#039;s my new drug dealer lol.&nbsp; &nbsp;but I thank god for our heroes and everyone who made this possible.&nbsp; Long live the road<br /><br />But I got to say even though I was ripped off on silk road it&#039;s a life saver for me

				Don&#039;t get me wrong if i could get my hands on this little scamming wanker, id fucking kill him. (or leave him for dead for sure)<br />i thought we were all in the same game. It boils my blood to think the majority of us are simply here for supply and demand on things you can&#039;t pick up over the counter.<br />Ive already had riots with two persons i know because of this. poor bastards were just in the firing line. little things i normally would have let slip by.<br />never mind, another weekend without my precious green.&nbsp; :&#039;( :&#039;(<br />What i would give to get my meat hooks into that fucker. Hiding behind the anonymity of it all.&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:(

				Right Guys&#039;n&#039;Dolls, Its time to put this to bed.<br />Contacted SR regarding this matter. over the weekend they got back to me. They asked me to check if the voucher has been used. <br />Whilst im checking that out a vendor who i bought some off before got back in touch with me, letting me know he has more for sale. So, i sheepishly made the same order and gave him the old code. Obviously if it bounced i&#039;d simply give him a new code and apologize for any delay or inconvenience i caused him........<br />Bish, bash, bosh done!<br />within a blink of an eye my account was looking rather healthy again. <br />It looks like the first vendor hadn&#039;t even checked his mail at all. I must admit i do feel a little guilty as that vendor could be in hospital or worse.&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; <br />Anyway, all is well and i&#039;m not down. Extremely stressed over the whole situation but on the mend and got some beautiful strains of the finest green in transit. YIPPEE!!!!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D

				Glad it all worked out for you. See, its best to not even think of that &#039;ripped off&#039; feeling. it can take years off your life for no reason.&nbsp; But who am I kidding, I get that feeling every time I step out the front door, knowing that we live in a world based on thievery and dishonesty.
