				I noticed that SR&#039;s drug inventory is quickly growing. <br /><br />How much of this growth do you suppose is legit (e.g., not from scammers or LEO)?<br /><br />How big do you think SR will get before it becomes a major target of LEO?<br /><br />How big do you think SR is likely to get?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				i bet the inventory would be a lot more than it is now if SR didn&#039;t close vendor registration occasionally, but i&#039;m sure SR is being pragmatic about it as to not have an influx of scamming sellers. Having a flood of bad sellers would not be good for the site&#039;s name.&nbsp; &nbsp;As long as the established vendors can keep the community supplied, and everyone is making money then i can see this site becoming as big as craigslist.&nbsp;

Buyers don&#039;t know anyone on SR, so they couldn&#039;t help. Vendors likely know their suppliers; so LEOs will target them.<br /><br />I think some people on this site are way too paranoid. I learned from a professor and a defense attorney that most criminals are never caught. When people are caught, it&#039;s almost always because there&#039;s a witness, the person trusted the wrong person, or couldn&#039;t keep her mouth shut. <br /><br />SR doesn&#039;t have those problems really; so there&#039;s not much to worry about.

				I would think that if the police were guilty of distributing drugs they would be charged as such, but recently they were found selling high powered guns to gangsters (fast and furious, I think the operation was called) and nothing happened with that.. so who knows.

Anyone can send anyone anything.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m just trying to imagine a scenario where a vendor with hundreds of transactions and good feedback suddenly turns out to be LEO, or maybe even got busted and is now working with LEO. Or maybe the vendor&#039;s computer was compromised by LEO at some point, or under surveillance the whole time.<br /><br />Maybe most of a vendor&#039;s transactions are from LEO shills, done quickly (or slowly) to build trust. They could build a network of vendors and shills. LEO could do this with tons of different vendor accounts, creating honeypots where they will catch big buyers buying large amounts, with an intent to distribute. Don&#039;t buy large amounts? You could still be caught in their net.<br /><br />Vendors are told to destroy addresses but someone working with LEO obviously won&#039;t do that. What could that big list of names and addresses be used to do? There are a lot of posts on these forums telling people to use your real name and use your real address. Even if a parcel is not addressed to the real buyer, why was the parcel sent to that address? The buyer lives at that address, or someone who knows the buyer lives at that address, or the buyer is trying to frame someone, or I don&#039;t know maybe the location is vacant. Maybe &quot;anyone can send anyone thing&quot;, but in this case the vendor is LEO and they know what they sent.<br /><br />Vendors could be dropping parcels from anywhere. But buyers have to provide a valid address for delivery, and that makes them (or someone they know) vulnerable.<br /><br />Or maybe the LEO vendor doesn&#039;t actually send any parcels at all, but simply sends the name/address to local LEO who perform a controlled delivery. Say this is done in multiple states when the vendor decides to strike all at once. Or maybe it&#039;s done throughout the vendor&#039;s history but the buyer is incarcerated and has no way to warn people on the forums. Who&#039;s going to notice when a bunch of buyers go missing?<br /><br />Say multiple search warrants are served at once. Say they find controlled substances at some of the addresses, and seize computers. Say some people at the addresses talk and point the finger at the true buyer.<br /><br />Poker sites in the US had a Black Friday and nobody saw it coming. Everything was just seized all at once. I expect the DEA would like to do the same with SR.

				Silpheed, that is what has happened with a couple other drug forums (dzf and the a-s boards come to mind immediately). On dzf, one attack vector was that the forum was set up as a federal honeypot and was used to farm addresses and other intelligence from the legit vendors. When the end came, they brought down most of the large opiate vendors, a few other vendors, and used the farmed addresses to make a few controlled deliveries. I know firsthand some were made, but not how many, but I would guess the majority of buyers got away -- the risk is still there though. They also did buyer flooding on dzf and a-s like you describe, but I am not sure how they used that intelligence beyond busting the vendors. The type of vendor flooding attack you describe is exactly what I would expect the feds to do next on SR though, since most people use encryption now and pwning the server would open only up more difficult attacks like mitm, etc. than simply reading vendors&#039; mail.

I do not know for sure whether the owner was turned or whether the forum was an FBI honeypot from the very beginning. What I do know firsthand is that the forum became a deathtrap at some point, several members of staff and many buyers were FBI, and the end came soon after. Some of the policies of the owner also significantly deanonymized users in ways that could be misattributed to incompetence but make sense if you assume it was a federal sting operation from jumpstreet.

That&#039;s really hard to do unless they seize your computer and even then it could be pretty difficult.

HOWEVER, you&#039;d have to prove that the person at that address was actually ordering the product. That&#039;s really hard to do unless they seize your computer and even then it could be pretty difficult. That&#039;s why some people make little variations in their real names because you could always argue that there was spelling error so it got sent to the incorrect person.<br /><br />I guess they could pose as a vendor and ship real products to your house, but they&#039;d have to actually accept your money for the product (i.e. escrow). It&#039;s illegal for cops to accept money for drugs regardless of if its a sting operation or whatever. That&#039;s why they always bust the dude after he gives a string prostitute money because if he wanted the sex then the money it would mean the cop undercover has technically broken the law.<br /><br />#highlogic<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If they had a search warrant I assume they would seize any computers they found. And LEO now knows a valid address. They can start asking questions. &quot;Who could have ordered this&quot;, etc.<br /><br />If LEO can&#039;t actually accept money in a sting, simply outsource it (find some guy who is willing to do it for them). In that case, LEO doesn&#039;t have to be a vendor, they simply have to find a person or people willing to be vendors and report back to them.<br /><br />A vendor might not actually be LEO, but how do you know a vendor is not narcing (snitching) on buyers, especially if they&#039;re getting paid to do so? Doing it after every order may seriously damage their feedback rating, but if they saved up 500 names or so and *then* snitched for money, what then? I suppose by then much of the drugs would be used and gone, but some buyers are bound to have something illegal sitting around.

That is the weak link in the chain. Even after the labyrinth of all the steps to obtain bitcoin and TOR and PGP and tumblers, the vendor still sees a real address. An address where a warrant can be served, or put under surveillance, or questions asked, or property seized, or simply added to some watchlist.<br /><br />What does LEO gain out of it? Asset forfeiture, for one.<br />http://reason.com/archives/2010/01/26/the-forfeiture-racket/singlepage<br /><br />If tons of buyers were busted at once it would have a chilling effect on the marketplace.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made some other comments about LEO:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9297.msg86941#msg86941<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9491.msg87748#msg87748<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9297.msg90015#msg90015<br /><br />A huge net of LEO vendors would absolutely disrupt SR. As well as a huge net of LEO buyers that acted as shills for LEO vendors. And LEO doesn&#039;t even need to pay for a vendor account, they can simply find a vendor who&#039;s willing to be an informant.<br /><br />The DEA isn&#039;t going to just let SR operate freely, indefinitely.

Then threy&#039;ll wonder why you didn&#039;t inform the Post Office. But generally, you still have a pretty low risk of arrest.

				it certainly is scary that the risk of LEO being present on SR is always there, however I&#039;m sure everyone is using their own discretion and better judgement in protecting themselves and others if a worst case scenario situation were to play out. Regardless, sticking with reputable vendors will be my main safeguard among others to protect my identity!
