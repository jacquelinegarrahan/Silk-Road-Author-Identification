				Due to SR&#039;s recent technical difficulties, one of my orders will auto-finalize very soon, either tonight or tomorrow. I don&#039;t&nbsp; theres no way to help this, not being able to log in. I also suppose the admins/mods can&#039;t prevent this.<br /><br />Really bummed because my product isn&#039;t here yet and it will be my first auto-finalize!<br />&nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />

				Unfortunately there is not anything that can be done. The mods can&#039;t access the SR site, and the admins are working as hard as they can to get it up and running.&nbsp; Even if they could somehow get into your account, it would be unfair to all the hundreds of other buyers who are in the same situation.&nbsp; They couldn&#039;t drop everything just to go into peoples accounts and finalize things (I don&#039;t think they CAN do that at any rate, but they shouldn&#039;t)<br /><br />&nbsp;If you have any vendors who ask you to FE because of your stats you could tell them that it happened during this down time, hopefully they will understand.&nbsp; Also the more transactions you have the lower that auto finalize % will be.&nbsp; Hopefully it will be up and running on Monday and you can log in before the time is up. It is calculated by the hour, so it will be exactly 14 full 24 hour days from when the package was marked in transit.&nbsp; So you may have more time than you realize.&nbsp;

				Yup, I&#039;m in the exact same boat.<br /><br />I was going to go into resolution with an order today if it wasn&#039;t in the mail but it looks like it&#039;s going to auto-finalize instead.<br /><br />I talked to the vendor and he said he&#039;d make right my missing order so I may still end up seeing the product some time next week.&nbsp; But if not and if it hits auto-finalize I&#039;m going to be out the fifty bucks and have an auto-finalize on my buying stats.<br /><br />Pretty shitty.

				adding my +1 to the thread, I&#039;ve been trying to resolve my order since last night - I&#039;ll be auto-finalizing within almost 24 hours :(<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried contacting my vendor through the forums, but I still haven&#039;t heard back, and I don&#039;t know how else to contact him/her.

				Hopefully they will do some kind of rollback.&nbsp; It makes since because a lot of people will be losing money to auto-finalization.

				I&#039;m completely fucked if my order auto-finalises. It didn&#039;t arrive, and will auto-finalise either today or early tomorrow. They HAVE to rollback on it to give people a chance to sort it out surely.

				3200$ order auto finalized yesterday.... but the package came today so its a huge relief. This large of an order however will completely fuck my auto finalize stats because its my largest order to date..
