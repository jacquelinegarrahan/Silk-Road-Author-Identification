				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_%28marketplace%29<br /><br />The site asks for your pass AND pin. <br /><br />If you put both of those items in you should attempt to change both asap before you lose control of your account.

				I&#039;m not sure exactly how this onion stuff works but it appears the URL&#039;s are generated randomly and that the Silk Road URL was egnerated suign a massive amount of computer power since it has non random characters at the beginning &quot;silkroad&quot;. In the future make sure you look for that and take note if the site is asking for your pin as well as your password.<br /><br />Sorry for your loss.<br /><br />

				I just got locked out of my new account I created to become a Vendor (AussieDirectDrugs) 10 minutes after transferring 24.33 BTC in, I used the Wikipedia Link (http://silkroadvlsu5apk.onion) to access Silk Road and was told there had been unauthorised attempts to access my account and to enter my passcode and pin. After entering these I was directed to a login page with a slightly different address (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home) and it keeps telling me &quot;login failed please try again&quot; even though i&#039;m 100% sure my details are correct.<br /><br />Is there any way to recover my account? I don&#039;t want to be put off becoming a vendor here but losing $360 for no reason is still a massive setback<br /><br />Please help.

				Now, all the new people create a new notepad document and encrypt it!<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion - SR<br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion -SR forum<br />kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion - hidden wiki<br />clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion - HackBB<br /><br />Why? Going on wikipedia for SR link all the time is stupid!! <br /><br />Hey, I came here so I can copy the link for the onion network. I&#039;m going to buy some drugs online, thank you wiki.<br /><br />I&#039;ve memorized the links, you don&#039;t have to but it would be useful trust me....<br /><br /><br />

				Why on EARTH, with the ability for Wikipedia to be edited by literally hundreds of thousands of people, are you all using it as a reliable source of information and for the SR address?!&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Do as thecrackhead suggested: put the addresses into a notepad document and encrypt it.<br /><br />The things I hear here never fail to shock me...&nbsp; :o

				Agreed. Using wikipedia for the SR link is very silly.<br /><br />I have a text file like this:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br />Username: **********<br />Password: ************************************<br />PIN: **********<br /><br />Compress and encrypt the text file with 7zip then store it on an encrypted USB (use truecrypt) on a hidden partition. No fucker will ever crack that shit. Just make sure you use complex passwords for the 7zip archive and the truecrypt volume and memorize them! This is what works best for me cos my SR password is so ridiculously complex I&#039;d never remember it!<br /><br />...and of course have multiple backups of the USB drive in multiple locations!
