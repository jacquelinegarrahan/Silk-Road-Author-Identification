				This is a warning to the forum members that BTC transactions on SR are not safe. absolutely NEVER use someone trying to do a transaction advertised on the forum!<br /><br />There have recently been vendors who are stealing peoples money - please be careful and do research before sending your code to a thief<br /><br />even if they have a few positive feedback on SR this does not mean anything - they can leave it for themselves from shill accounts and they cancel transactions after receiving the code to prevent scammed buyers from being able to leave feedback<br /><br />If you are going to use a SR vendor to buy BTC - make sure you read through the forums and find MANY positive reviews of people successfully buying coins from them. and remember even a previously trustworthy member can go rogue and begin to steal. <br /><br />If you have questions whether i have seen forum reports of a potential vendor scamming, please ask me and i may be able to direct you to a thread<br /><br />PLEASE BE CAREFUL - do not get scammed. Here is a message from one of the scammers i received today which should serve to emphasize the risk <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=16866">Quote from: King Joey Wins on November 06, 2012, 01:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">microRNA,<br /><br />I hope your day is going well, even though you banned some of my names your still a good mod. I like that you take action, I like that you dont like me also :) <br /><br />But most of all I like the fact that you couldnt stop me from cashin 31 moneypaks, 2 were for $1,000 each<br /><br />That vendor is old news~~ But I have another&nbsp; vendor account!! Hopefully you can rid SR of my vendor account be4 I take a few dozen peoples money. In total $7,000 for a scam that has went 4 days.<br /><br />If I wasnt a scammer and you wernt a mod I would hang out with ya :)<br /><br />Good luck 2 you!!<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Wow. As Captmal said.....what a dick. Buyers need to be EXTREMELY cautious buying BTC in general on SR. I have done it a few times, but only with VERY reputable vendors with many positive transactions. Also, I would never even think of using moneypak to do it. Use captainmal, blue sky traders, or Rxking and you will be good. I think eventually the moneypak deal will be recognized easily as a scam, particularly if the aforementioned vendors take a stance against it, which I believe captainmal already has, after being scammed himself by a moneypak.

				TAKE THIS AS FACT.<br /><br />I just tried to make my first purchase on SR and sent a Moneypak to USPS, who ran off with it and didn&#039;t finalize my order. It&#039;s already been cashed.<br /><br />DO NOT BE LAZY AND TAKE THE EASY ROUTE. Process your BTC through REPUTABLE entities, such as Bitinstant. <br /><br />Hell, if you can, use localbitcoins and do your transactions in person. These people are making away with thousands per day, don&#039;t be a statistic.

Hopefully the admins can do something to help you out. There are legitimate vendors here who sell BTC. Moneypak just happens to be a VERY, VERY dangerous way of doing it. My advice is to steer clear of any vendor offering BTC for MP. The three I will recommend are Captainmal, Blue sky traders, and Rxking. They are legit and will take good care of you. DO NOT take a risk with some upstart vendor when it comes to BTC, you will most likely regret it. Hopefully this helps get rid of the moneypak issue for buyers and vendors. Don&#039;t forget, vendors are being scammed by MP&#039;s as well.

				This is a very good post for new members to read because it is a risky move to entrust somebody u have never or will never meet with your money but i would like to note as somebody who has used moneypaks in order to recieve btc the best and most trustworthy vendor is Sugarmama.&nbsp; She has taken care of many transactions for me and i have never doubted her trustworthiness.&nbsp; I am not her nor do i believe this is a great way to get btc but if u are new I know how it is and this is the easiest way to get btc imo, but now i realize there is safer, cheaper, and easier ways to get ur btc so just do ur hw

				Please, anyone who is scammed by a money pak vendor REPORT THEM TO SR support and PLEASE leave a scam REPORT ON THE FORUM to help others and prevent them from scamming as many members<br /><br />I have compiled a list of the vendors i found with reports of scamming and sent them to support, but they need the reports from the person that was actually scammed for it to have more meaning. <br /><br />That list includes: UncleJoesTradingPost, Cardersdream, Jankyjankins, and USPS<br />vendors i would also be weary of include: WeBuyMoneyPak and BTCdistributor<br /><br />Thats interesting you mention USPS. Honestly they sent me a donation earlier today-&nbsp; while claiming they had extra money after buying a number of vendor accounts, so i had my suspicions they may be up to something fishy. i was actually in contact with another member who mentioned he was scammed by them so decided to send the donation over to him because we have been conversing. i couldnt accept the money knowing it might have been stolen from him unfortunately although it only repaid a small amount of what he said he lost

				A good idea is to write on the main site something like : &quot;BEWARE FROM SCAM! ALWAYS CHECK THE FORUMS TO SEE IF YOUR VENDOR IS LEGIT BEFORE YOU PLACE AN ORDER!&quot;, so no one can miss it. Also, on the order section after the user finalizes write a message like : &quot;AFTER YOUR PRODUCT HAS ARRIVED, PLEASE LEAVE SOME REVIEW ON THE FORUMS, THANKS!&quot;<br /><br /><br />All SR customers should cooperate together to minimize the scams to 1 max per scammer, then he&#039;ll get banned.<br /><br /><br /><br />Peace,<br />BPM
