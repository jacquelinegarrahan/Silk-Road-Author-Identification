				Something is 100% wrong.<br />I recently deposited coins and have 6 times more the amount than I should. Its seriously like I hit a little lotto here lol. Was really sketched out at first but its probably an SR problem. But I mean thatd be good if were just the lucky few.<br />Checked my account history and theres a bunch of random deposits after my legit deposit.<br />Hope we get an update from staff.

				i reloaded the page to see i had 6btc... reloaded again and i had 12!!!... first thing i thought was something is wrong with SR so i tried to transfer to another wallet to see if the transaction would actually go through (yes! really!) checking blockchain.info i can see it has come from my sr address but its going to a different address than i requested. strange. it does have 4 confirmations but only for 6btc...<br /><br />this is all really weird!<br />

				60 BTC? Jesus. I don&#039;t know too much about how SR handles BTC, but if it tumbles them, I&#039;m assuming there&#039;s been a huge glitch in this process. <br /><br />In theory, someone could withrdraw their &#039;extra&#039; BTC and pretty much run off with a huge amount of someone else&#039;s money without any actual backlash..

				If this is as serious as it sounds, those holding large stocks may try and offload them causing a crash in the BTC price.&nbsp; What would happen if I tried to purchase BTC instantly now.&nbsp; Would they go through multiple times and I would receive more?&nbsp; For those who have received extra, why not try donating 1 to each of our usernames and we can see if they reach us?

				hi guys,<br />i offer a bit of explanation based on some basic research i did earlier on.<br />the private keys to all the addresses generated in your accoutn are owned by SR (ie, they are stored on the SR server).<br />when you transfer money to your account, you are actually transferring it to SR wallet ( well, so far so good.. most exchanges also function this way ). these coins then get tumbled, or moved around and when needed for get withdrawn. In most cases, there will be no link between your deposit address and your withdrawal address.<br />&nbsp;<br />i have noticed that soon after a deposit ( within a few hours ), the money leaves the address, without me making a purchase or withdrawing anything.<br />the amount that shows up on your acccount page is a number that is stored in a DB ( most probably ).all this leads me to believe, with a great amount of certainty, that this is indeed a glitch, and has nothing to do with your actual account balance.<br /><br />this is also probably the reason why you are unable to withdraw any coins.<br /><br />

				I agree with AA only if it wasn&#039;t DPR/SR losing out on the money. For a little while last night, I believed it wasn&#039;t. Then we all started to test it out, and Blockchain wasn&#039;t reporting any of the fake btc transactions.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure DPR lost out on a chunk of money anyway, not sure how much. People went on shopping sprees last night, and while the BTC got rolled back, the orders are still there. So your account just goes negative. I decided to cancel the orders, my other option was to resell the drugs to pay back, but I didn&#039;t want to risk not being able to for some reason.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some people are gunna wait on the product to show up and then just ditch their negative SR accounts. I was only negative $160, so that thought didn&#039;t really come through for me.

				Yeah, I can understand the logic behind stealing from other companies but when it&#039;s someone like DPR, you&#039;re a straight up piece of shit. IMO.

				Idk what they going to do. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s possible someone could have got a order in. Guess it just depends if that vendor got it out before he seen that message from support.

Usually it takes about an hr after i deposited the money, but right now, it is 930 pm and i still dont have my 85 dollars. Please believe me that im not trying to take advantage of this situation (id ask for a lot more if i was), but i believe that maybe the reason that i dont have my bitcoins is because of the issue that everyone has been having. From what ive read so far, it seems that people are saying that its DPR&#039;s money? like from his own personal account? Is it possible that one of you guys got my 85 dollars by mistake?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Naw, those weren&#039;t real BTC being sent out to random members. They were just duplicates of deposits.<br /><br />How did you go about buying BTC? If Bit Instant, email or call them and they&#039;ll send them out for you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />thank you sir. Ill do that if they havent arrived by tomorrow. I figured it was an issue with Silk road itself, with all the shenannigans going on today

We were only getting insane amounts of &quot;btc&quot; because it was a glitch in the system, a numbers glitch. deposits were being credited over and over until DPR shut down SR himself. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry buddy, you&#039;ll get your 85$. If it doesn&#039;t show up, like Moon Fried said, contact bitinstant they&#039;ll work it out with you

				Im pretty sure I did the transaction correctly. I have shitty handwriting, so sometimes the cashier has put the wrong numbers in. When they put the wrong numbers in, their computer doesn&#039;t allow them to finalize the deposit. It has to be a valid account number. There were no problems today when I went in so I assume they sent it to my account. Unless the lady entered one digit wrong, and that combination of numbers happened to be the bitcoin wallet of some random person. I really doubt that though. Maybe bitinstant just made a mistake or something. After seeing reports of people having 900 BTCs in their accounts today, I started to get a little worried. Sorry if I freaked out a little bit. I know 85 dollars doesn&#039;t mean that much to you supreme coldhearted drug kingpins, but for a regular guy who just saved up enough money to get a 5strip it&#039;s kind of upsetting to find out that your money pretty much disappeared without a trace.<br /><br /><br />P.S: I dont plan on being poor for very long. Im going to make an account on black market reloaded, and start selling bottles of my own piss for HALF the price of the other piss sellers. Ill put them out of business and make my own piss bitcoin empire. Ill make thousands of dollars and then ill be able to buy whatever I want. If 85 dollars goes missing i&#039;ll just laugh and make a few more bottles of piss. But for now, I wait...
