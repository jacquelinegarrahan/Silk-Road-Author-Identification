				Browse through any SR vendors recent feedback and you will see responses such as<br /><br />&quot;Very quick shipping and great communication!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Awesome pacakging,here in 3 days.Haven&#039;t tried but I will leave feedback eventually&quot;<br /><br />&quot;perfecto&quot;<br /><br />Why does it seem like 90% of feedback is left as soon as the product is received.&nbsp; That&#039;s great that the shipping time was fast and you received your product but I am sure most people are WAY more interested in how you felt about the product.<br /><br />Just my 0.02 but if you are a buyer please try and leave feedback about the actual product.<br /><br />Cheers and happy travels &lt;3

				The thing that gets me, is when people put &#039;got here in three days&#039;. But don&#039;t say which country they&#039;re in.<br />How do I know if three days is quick to where they live and it gives me no idea how quickly it may take to get to me!<br />&nbsp;???

				I&#039;d rather not leave a long review for every order that i make on here. Thats what the review pages on the forums are for. You shouldn&#039;t be going off of the reviews when choosing a vendor anyway, remember Time Traveler? Its easy for fake feedback to be left.

				I was under the impression that SR feedback was purely based on the transaction encompassed. It is a market of distribution and purchasing where as here we can praise or lament a product by a vendor in a much more faster and up to date fashion since supply changes all the time.

				What grinds my gears is when people write &quot;FE for trusted vendor, will update on shipping/quality once received&quot;, and then they never update it even though the order was months ago.

				The review part of silk road is one of its best features, iv started leaving a detailed reviews of products i think its a good way of showing appreciation for vendors and there products.<br />People who say &quot;will update after testing&quot; and then don&#039;t bother piss me off.

Because a lot of US vendors don&#039;t ship aboard (the products I&#039;m interested in anyway) their listings don&#039;t appear to me. So, I&#039;m mostly looking at EU vendor listings who are shipping internationally. Therefore it&#039;s not obviously a domestic US buyer! And, international shipping, for me, can be less than three days (and three days was just an example).<br />That&#039;s why, when someone assumes it&#039;s obvious their feedback is talking about US domestic shipping times, without stating it. Their feedback is useless to me, personally&nbsp; ;).

There is so much choice, in some sections (cannabis for one!), that it&#039;s not always easy to decide.<br />Feedback for short, clear reviews. Rumor mill for longer, more detailed reviews.

				To be completely honest the feedback has become useless to me. There is rarely a product that I read about from the forums that actually meet the standards that the reviewers have given it.<br />I personally think it&#039;s just a bunch of inexperienced users on the forums who just think anything is good as long as it fucks them up. <br />Not saying everyone on the forum is like that but the majority of the reports i go by and think they are reliable turn out to be bs.<br />Who knows maybe I&#039;m getting a different batch every time this has happened.&nbsp; ::) but I doubt it.<br /><br />But that being said the only thing I really care to see in the actual feedback section is that the product was as advertised and packaging was up to par.<br />

				No, and yes, plus they talk behind our backs in another forum.<br />So be careful what you say, how you rate, and your behavior.<br />You can, and will be black listed.<br /><br />I figure it&#039;s better to be nice to vendors, any how.<br />Get more stuff with honey thing.
