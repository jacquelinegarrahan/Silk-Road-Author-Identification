				So still with no REAL word on what the hell is going on and no REAL word if the site will ever even be back up, what&#039;s up with funds stuck in SR and escrow?<br /><br />What&#039;s the point of anyone having a backup address listed on their account if nothing is being sent there. Wasn&#039;t this the sole purpose incase &#039;something&#039; happens funds will get released?<br /><br />But NOTHING ??? Does this mean if SR doesn&#039;t come back then all money tied up ain&#039;t ever coming out ? What about vendors who have sent product and have money in escrow and have back up addy in place ?<br /><br />Pretty sure you can say this is a case of &#039;something&#039; going wrong. So release the funds right ??

				At the settings page, in the field &quot;backup address&quot; you enter a BTC address you want to be used to have your funds transferred to and update the settings page.

				The site will be up and running, just may take a while. Have a 100%&nbsp; faith in DPR,&nbsp; he&#039;s just making sure everything is alright and can handle the big load when its up again. The site will be mega busy when its back up and theres no point rushing the job, only having it to go down again.<br />:)
