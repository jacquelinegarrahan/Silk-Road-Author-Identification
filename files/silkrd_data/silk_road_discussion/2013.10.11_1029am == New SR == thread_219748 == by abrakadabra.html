				How about we as a community piece together a system with no central DPR to fuck us all over by making dumbass mistakes, instead a system of 1 dude raking in the commish, we pool it up as a group somehow, and invest in security, defense, pay for servers THAT ARE SAFE,&nbsp; and we donate lots of money to charity to help show our character as good folks

				Good idea, but I don&#039;t think the site should be called silk road, I mean why? I think if a new site comes into play as the next big thing, it should be new, and fresh, not trying to capitalize off of what SR did, bcuz not all sequels to movies are good, if you get what I&#039;m saying. PLUS on top of that, these vendors have made themselves comfortable with SM, and BMR, I think the idea of reputable people should continue to make these sites, just in case we get another seized notice on SM or BMR, hopefully not, but a site ran, and organized is a great idea, sort of like the mafia, where you have the boss, under boss, capos, and soldiers, except these are all good hackers, and everybody plays their own roll in protecting the site, is a wonderful idea, but the process should be kept secret, and not broadcasted on the forums, and maybe soon we&#039;ll have something good pop up.

				the problem with keeping secrets on an anonymous network is that there is virtually no way to know for sure who is or isn&#039;t the enemy or a turncoat, I mean really how do I know my taxes don&#039;t pay your salary?

I don&#039;t think they can sell and deliver dope under cover, but I then I didn&#039;t think they could put guns on the street in a UC operation either and we know the US ATF did that.....

We should send a % of the commission to charity every month. We seen that DPR was apparently making 1.2m in commissions every month. It would be a very nice gesture from the guys who will be running the new site. It would show all the haters that we are not just &#039;&#039;druggies&#039;&#039; but good people with morals.
