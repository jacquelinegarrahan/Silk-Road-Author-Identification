				Shitty man. Hope you get that worked out. Something funny is definitely going on though. I&#039;ve sent about 20 BTC to accounts 18 hours ago and still none have shown. I hope the Road is just having minor glitches. <br /><br />I hope you get your money back!

				I think SR is having a software issue. This has happened in that past.<br />Your problem, relates to the new BTC&nbsp; lotto winners in the other thread.<br />Explains why a listing I was watching is gone.<br /><br />Folks, I think we are in for a short term ride.<br />My advice is sit tight. Hopefully SR Support is on it.<br /><br />Understand the anonymous nature, not all the dots connect on purpose.<br />Hopefully a MOD can find out. I would think SR Support is too busy trying to fix the problem, than to report on it.<br /><br />You aren&#039;t broke, and the others aren&#039;t rich. Sit tight ;) but thanks for the news, explains the glitches I have seen today.

				Thanks and +1<br /><br />It will be a while, so you all can stop bitching, but you won&#039;t. Thats what makes a forum, so post away. ;D<br /><br />I hope it&#039;s a small bug. I think it took about 8 hours the last time, but it was late at night. This is prime time, and this place is so much bigger. <br />Holy shit, when I realize how much this has grown. 8)

				Welcome Scout! Haven&#039;t seen you before. When&#039;d you become a mod?<br /><br />No worries at all here. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a pain in the ass, but they&#039;ll get it all worked out.
