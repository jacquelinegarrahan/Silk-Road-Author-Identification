				What could this possibly mean in the sellers main seller page. &quot;I ship within 24 hours of an order being placed in a stealthy mode. &quot;<br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard a reply from him in a day after I sent a message, and it seems as if my order&nbsp; has been in processing mode for like 2 days now. I hope he gets my order :((( maybe hes just backed up<br /><br /><br />starservice is the name of the vendor tell me if you&#039;ve bought from him and had good outcomes

				It means you have to place your order in a &quot;stealthy mode&quot; before the vendor will ship. You didn&#039;t know this?<br />Jk. You should try reading the forums rather than posting questions thet have been answered.<br /><br />-1

				Just my 2cents that are probably only worth a penny but.<br /><br />As I would read it a vendor in `stealth mode`which only would be visible if you are a fan.&nbsp; That order would be shipped within 24hrs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why would a vendor use stealth mode....my guesses they are away they are running low on product they are backlogged and need to catch up.....these are only guesses and not based on any facts kinda like most of my replies :) I am unaware of any way a buyer can make anything stealthy but an still learning everyday!

				I still don&#039;t understand how to make a purchase in stealth mode, not only do I not know how, but I already made my purchase without doing this so called stealth mode ordering. I tried to look up other threads that have previously been answered, but couldn&#039;t find any in the search thing. <br /><br /><br />Can someone please help me with this stealthy mode, or at least link me in the right direction. I already made my purchase, so does that mean I&#039;ll be able to re due it in stealthy mode, or will I just have to cancel my order. The seller hasn&#039;t replied to me in in 2 days, so I imagine he&#039;s really busy. PLEASE HELP

				yea but still no one has explained what stealthy mode is, I was never offered this. Now I think this is why my order has been sitting in processing for 3 days now. Can someone please clarify what ordering in stealthy mode means, or where I can read about it. I tried to search the forums, but couldn&#039;t find anyone. <br /><br /><br />PLEASE HELP

				I mean meta do you think he&#039;ll come through with the order, and make this happen? Or do you think it&#039;s best just to take my service elsewhere. I just would hate to have to do such a thing with someone with such good reviews as this person. I can almost gurrentee he&#039;s just really busy, but it&#039;s just when none of my messages end up getting returned regardless of being backed up . busy it just worries me man, especially when I would&#039;ve had to FE to begin with considering I had less then 5 buys on SR

				Most messages without sensitive info can be plain text your address or anything that is sensitive in nature should be encrypted.&nbsp; good vendors have alot of messages to go thru have lives and apparently have shipping to be dealing with. You seem abit freaked out about this transaction I just had to go and look at the vendor as I am unaware of them.&nbsp; I see a vendor that only has a couple listings so maybe is backed up on shipping would you rather they rush and do a sloppy job but has a 99.8% feedback with over 10 5/5 in the last 2 days alone. I am not sure of your buying stats as there profile says that they offer 50% for under&nbsp; 5 transactions and 100% for over 5 &quot; I will NOT offer a refund if your DCN# shows it has been delivered&quot; .&nbsp; If&nbsp; you have not FE&nbsp; then your money is still in escrow and you would be out nothing but abit of time.&nbsp; I agree that lack of communication with a vendor is frustrating but with the feedback I am seeing they are supplying people that seem happy. I would suggest having abit of faith once in a while You have the option of not using this vendor in the future, that is the joy of a free marketplace

In my case, I didn&#039;t really lose any money compared to what I had expected to have, but I would have preferred un-hedged (and so would you, as long as the market is bullish). I think you had your thought process backwards :-) In your example you would lose about 10% of your bitcoins, when you cancelled, because they would be &quot;bought back&quot; (not sure how SR does this actually) at a higher price which means less bitcoins :(
