				BEFORE I START:<br />DPR, the reason I respect you so much is because you take other people&#039;s opinions into consideration when you make decisions. As an Administrator, that is your most winning characteristic. I love this Market/Community to death because of what you have done.&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Yes, I realize I am asking a leading question. IGDAF though. GUYS, THIS NEW FEEDBACK SYSTEM IS POO.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Main Points:<br /><br />1) The freshness of comments was removed.... this essentially prevents buyers from knowing how active a vendor has been recently. I base alot of what I buy on whether the vendor has been active recently. CHANGE THIS BACK.<br /><br />2) The new limit of transactions has been imposed... it now says: 300+ transactions. Thats BULLSHIT DAWG&nbsp; :-[ . This site should recognize the vendors who have had many transactions.. In my opinion the cap should be at 1,000 transactions.<br /><br />3) Vendor Ranking: GUYS THIS ISN&#039;T FUCKING HARVARD. I am not in the top 10% of my class. &quot;ranked in the bottom 29% of sellers with 99.8% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions.&quot; This doesn&#039;t even mean anything to me..<br /><br />4) I am hammered.<br /><br /><br />Enjoy the rant.

				I may be a new user here, but I&#039;ve long browsed the site, so I&#039;ve seen both systems, but I&#039;d like to see a run down of the specific changes (and the reasons behid them if you can) if possible too.

				The only thing that needs to be reverted is displaying the age of the feedback.

				just posting this part because maybe no one has saw this yet. the feedback on the profile page is not picking the last 10 it just picking 10 random ones. i look back and found the feedback it was showing on the profile page itself and some of them where form like 3 months ago.

				Yea, I too agree, this sucks! I also base my purchases off of a vendors recent feedback. I think that being able to see the most recent feedback is extremely important! As was said above, it lets you know when the last sales were, and also how the current product is quality wise in some cases. <br /><br />Please change it back!!

Percentage seller rank makes it harder for people to see the total number of sellers, while some of us can remember the rough figure of the now it will mean in the future it&#039;s much harder to say. Smaller transaction cap of 300+ so that larger sellers are harder to pick out, no pages of feedback to prevent people looking at pages of feedback to see how much a seller is moving. Coupled with the hexadecimal transaction numbers or whatever system SR is using to make them I&#039;d say they&#039;re making an effort to make life easier and more hidden for large sellers. Sellers who are pretty much already trusted in the community and benefit from being able to hide a little better if someone starts snooping for people to catch. <br /><br />On the downside though I dislike that I can&#039;t see how well other people&#039;s produces are selling by seeing how many pages of feedback they have, it&#039;s a useful tool for me to gauge the demand of a market but I suppose it also works in my favour too.

				Hmm.. well, if DigitlAlch, an administrator, says that he thinks it&#039;s a bug, it might be.&nbsp; Yeah, thumbs down on the feedback change.

				I am with Reseller here on some points, and for different reasons.<br /><br />I have no problem with capping the displayed transactions at 300 - this is a smart move in my eyes.&nbsp; I understand from DPR&#039;s point that capping the displayed transactions at 300 but then having 2 months of feedback history (which might contain 1000 transactions) is kind of counterintuitive.&nbsp; That being said, I would rather see a number limit on displayed feedback (like 200 or so) than a time limit anyway.<br /><br />I do think that getting rid of the time display and randomizing feedback is going to end up hurting buyers.&nbsp; The feedback tells a story when it&#039;s chronological, and it&#039;s a lot easier to nip a scammer in the bud (as a buyer) when you can see what&#039;s been happening for the last week.&nbsp; With the new system, the feedback that the scammer garnered in his quest to gain trust will appear to be new.&nbsp; This is dangerous, and will probably cost a lot of buyers a lot of money.

				Yeah, I honestly can&#039;t stand not seeing how recent feedback is. I&#039;m expecting something and i don&#039;t even know if it&#039;s been shipped yet or not, and I&#039;m looking at the feedback to see if other people have gotten anything yet and I can&#039;t tell when the feedback was left? Totally bogus.
