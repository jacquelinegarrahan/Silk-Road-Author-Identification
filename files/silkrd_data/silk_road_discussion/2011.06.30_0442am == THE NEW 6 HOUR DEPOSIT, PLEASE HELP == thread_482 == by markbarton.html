				OK, so someone (or myself using another program) sends me 10 BTC straight to the SR deposit address that is valid for 6 hours. It shows up as &quot;uncomfirmed&quot; at first. Now sometimes to make it confirmed on the other end (ex. virwox) it takes 24 hours. So then does it never work because of the 6 hour limit? Or is the 6 hour limit only for the initial deposit? and thus the confirmation process can take however long it needs and I am still ok? I am worried that my unconfirmeds will not go through because it wont be done within 6 hours. Only the initial deposits can be done with 6 hours sometimes you know?

				Huh? I had 4 BTC in my virwox account. I got the 6 hour address from SR and sent the 4 BTC to the SR (in my account). It appeared in the unconfirmed for a few hours and then the next day it just went away. I am not sure if that is because it wasn&#039;t confirmed within the 6 hours or if that has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />Basically the question is...<br /><br />Is the 6 hour window that SR deposit addresses have required for only the initial deposit or does it also have to be confirmed as well in the 6 hour period by whoever (in my case sirvox or bitcoin7 or mtgox, whichever site sent the BTC)

				It&#039;s for every transaction.&nbsp; So as I understand it, you tried to transfer 4 btc from virwox to SR and virwox didn&#039;t do it quick enough and SR automatically canceled the address.&nbsp; Hopefully you still have 4 btc in your Virwox account.&nbsp; It may pay to send it to a third party address first as it sounds like Virwox may not have an automated system

				Try sending your bitcoins to a mybitcoin.com account before you send it to SR that way it will transfer to the bitcoin.com wallet and they will transfer your funds fast enough that the 6 hour limint on btc address&#039; wont be an issue.<br /><br />Here is the .onion address for mybitcoin.com: http://xqzfakpeuvrobvpj.onion/login/index.php

				Same thing happened to me, I just posted a new thread at Technical support asking if my bitcoins would be lost. I really think that this 6 hour limit should be changed.

				6 hours? So can we still just send from a local bitcoin wallet? I don&#039;t want to have to use a 3rd party.
