				I offered to send my wellbutrin (stop smoking med+) to another site member, but now, I&#039;m having second thoughts.&nbsp; I&#039;m not doing this to make money, just cover the co-pay - purely altruistic.&nbsp; Like most, I&#039;m not 16 and have a lot to lose if connected to this site.&nbsp; That said, I do like to help others in need.&nbsp; Thus, my conundrum. <br /><br />Am I being fucking paranoid and or stupid?&nbsp; I doubt the law is looking to take down the illicit SSRI drug cartel.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				if you are being paid in BTC and have not given the other user any personally identifying information then you are takng no more risk than a vendor on the site, the risk here is on the buyer, you have no feedback, there is no escrow and if you dont deliver he cant do anything about it.<br /><br />saying that, if you do send them make sure to wear gloves etc so there is no way a packet/pArcel could ever be linked to you.

				...and make sure the gloves you wear are yellow dish washing gloves, powdered latex are just as bad as using bare hands pretty much. ;)
