				They might be interested in SR, but I doubt that they personally would be ordering drugs through here.&nbsp; Think about it for a second.&nbsp; Do you think these guys even have to leave their house to get drugs delivered?&nbsp; I am sure one of their devoted minions would gladly deliver drugs to them.. probably for free too.<br /><br />I am sure these guys have some coke that would be selling at $200/g SR price lol.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; Side story.&nbsp; Had a friend of a friend that worked on the &#039;Frasier&#039; set (intern I believe) while the show was being produced.&nbsp; Apparently, Kelsey Grammer had a small cocaine buffet on set at all times and it was widely known about and it wasn&#039;t a big thing at all.&nbsp; I am sure this is par for the course at every movie / series / etc. set

				i would have to agree that any real movie star would be able to get in contact with just about any drug imaginable. it comes with the territory of being rich, famous , and in the limelight. What i could see if senators and mayors doing it, because drug use is not a socially acceptable part of their job.

				Well, they film a ton of shit where I live, from movies, to commercials. We have a film commission, and I work with them a lot. These famous actors may have the hookup in Hollyweird, but when they leave, they are on their own. And they never fail to ask, either. From producers, to staff, to actors. When I was younger, I slung a lot of meth to those types of folks when they were in town. Probably how John Ritter really died! <br />And Woody Harrelson IS a pothead :D and cool as hell. <br />I honestly wouldn&#039;t doubt if there are famous people from actors, to sports on here. Even politicians, police (buying for the high, not the sting).<br />Fuck, didn&#039;t some famous Chicago Bear just get busted, and admit to supplying over 8lbs of coke a week to the upper midwest? <br />Come to think of it, I bet SR themselves are famous...or infamous. But they are definitely rich. I often think I have a great idea of who brainstormed this whole thing.

				While I agree that the A listers have access to whatever they want basically whenvever, not every celebrity is as famous and powerful as, say, George Clooney. I&#039;m believe some of the Andy Sandbergs (SNL) and some former and current pro athletes might be members of the SR community.<br /><br />I have the strange feelling that one of my customers is a former athlete, I imagine football player.) Probably not famous but might have played in the NFL.<br /><br />Point is, you never know who you are selling to. Could be President Obama for all you or I know.

				I absolutely think celebs would use SR. Take for instance, a traveling rock band (wink*). Getting drugs on the road in a reliable fashion is harder than most people think. More than that, they wouldn&#039;t know what the fuck they&#039;re getting when they go local. this is double true for H. or coKaine. Also sourcing local can be extremely exhausting and risky. i remeber hearing stories about that dud from alice in chains driving around the ghetto in his red ferrari trying to source H just hours before a show. Plus IF they do source locally you know there will be some asshole drug dealer will be name-dropping to everyone he knows. <br /><br />Not to be one of those assholes but...TRUE STORY, I used to sell tree in the day (ONLY THE BEST - and that was before dispensaries gave every assclown access to flames). I had a customer who was a club promotor. He hits me up one night at like 12:30 says he with a famous rapper - who will remain nameless, but a top 10 hip-hop artist nontheless and top 3 in NYC (hint). We burn an L and he&#039;s like &quot;damn this is some flame shit!&quot; as if he&#039;d never somked something that good, and I&#039;m like &quot;yeah but you probably get flame all the time right?&quot;. He looked all sad and was like &quot;no. when I&#039;m on tour times get rough, honestly I&#039;ll sometimes smoke schwag because it&#039;s all i can find!&quot; he went on to say&nbsp; that a lot of people are like &quot;yeah I can get you shit&quot;, but then you find out they don&#039;t know what the fuck their talking about. <br /><br />So, yeah there a lot of reasons a celeb might use sr, if not just for PR&#039;s sake

				I&#039;ve seen celebs come and go, and they are pretty hard up when out of &quot;tinseltown.&quot;<br />In big cities like LA/Hollywood or NY you can just call a guy to deliver whatever you want.<br />When they&#039;re in my neck of the woods, they have to ask a bunch of locals until they get what they&#039;re after.<br />The great thing, in my experience, is usually if you find them something good they throw a ton of cash at it and share the love.&nbsp; Well, except for coke... the coke guys usually disappear together and you can&#039;t find them until the locations manager unlocks the set bathroom. LOL<br />I recall a wrap party for an unspecified production where Michael Pare had a table covered in weed, and he was just rolling, rolling, rolling joints like half the night for people.&nbsp; He&#039;s a dick most of the time, but a generous dick at least.<br />He&#039;s one of those stars that is like, &quot;Don&#039;t fucking look at me!&quot; on set.<br />InZane Billy is another self-important weirdo that likes his green, though he has a &quot;card&quot; for it.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Totally unrelated to drugs, but a great celeb story nonetheless is about Sly Stallone.<br />During one production he would have a lineup of groupies outside his trailer.<br />One day he didn&#039;t stop to give up his wireless mic before going into his trailer.&nbsp; The sound guy says he heard Sly tell one of the girls, &quot;Get on your knees, cradle my balls, and tell me you love me.&quot;&nbsp; That made beer come out my nose I tell ya.

				God I hope there aren&#039;t any celebs. There may be some guy buying supply to give to a celeb, but that&#039;s kinda different.&nbsp; If one were to get outed it would be a shitstorm for them and SR. Way too much attention would be brought to this place.

				I wouldn&#039;t call myself a &quot;celebrity&quot; but I&#039;m a musician who has status in the underground music scene.&nbsp; In saying that I have no real drug connections (or very few) in real life so SR has been amazing for me to experiment with drugs that i wouldn&#039;t have the opportunity to experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;
