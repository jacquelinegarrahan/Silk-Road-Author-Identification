				Made a purchase with a vendor, then cancelled it (they didn&#039;t have a working PGP key at the time, so I thought it best to cancel). I&#039;m not dragging the vendor&#039;s name into this though, there is no need really<br /><br />The refund has been dealt with, less 6% of the original amount. Obviously, the escrow system means you can expect a different BTC value back, but since I made the order initially (literally yesterday), the BTC price has increased by ~2% in that time period, not decreased by 6%.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve received a request to make feedback on the purchase. What purchase?! Surely neither the vendor or the SR admin really want the feedback system to contain what it is I have to say about this situation!<br /><br /><br />It makes no sense that customers end up paying the purchase commission on refunds, I thought that happened at the Sellers &quot;end&quot;? And I also thought it only happened when an actual purchase takes place?

				I don&#039;t know if SR charges a commission on cancellations, that is on the money that goes back to buyer. If they do, I think that&#039;s highly inappropriate.<br /><br />MockFrog

It&#039;s not unknown for me...<br /><br />More than anything, I hope that this will at least serve to inform all SR users that the commission falls on you if you cancel a purchase (although in this case I had to get the seller to cancel, as they accepted the order in the hope that I would want drugs more than PGP. I want both equally!)<br /><br />I still fail to see what the commission is being charged for; receiving a refund for a purchase that was never even made isn&#039;t providing the customer with anything of value that they didn&#039;t already own, and cancellation refunds appear to be handled entirely automatically. <br /><br />So, I&#039;ve got less coins, no item, and a bunch of wasted time and effort. Silk Road has 6% of my coins and no direct wasting of their time at all, the whole process cost the site zero money and zero time. I do understand that developing the aspects of the site that provided me with this &quot;refund&quot; did and does take time for those administering the technical side, but if the sole functionality of the site was to accept money from customers, then give it back to them minus 6%, I don&#039;t think it would be quite as popular somehow.

				Yep, I really must start learning to reign myself in sometimes. As soon as I catch a sniff of someone trying to fuck me, I find it difficult not to go into Hitler mode, even if it&#039;s my own ignorance and carelessness that&#039;s actually responsible! <br /><br />Hope this will be an education to others too: if your vendor does hedged escrow, and the price goes up in between your order and your refund, then obviously you can expect less BTC back, but they&#039;re still worth the same amount in USD as when you made the order. If they do the other type of escrow, you can expect precisely the same number of coins back.&nbsp;
