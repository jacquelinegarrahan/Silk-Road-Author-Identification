				I think you may be confused about what bitcoin is. Bitcoin isn&#039;t a currency, just a token representing a certain value at a certain point in time.<br /><br />If one bitcoin today costs $14 and and your drug of choice costs two bitcoins on SR, then it will cost you $28. If on the other hand one bitcoin costs $28 a month later, the cost of your drug of choice will go down to one bitcoin, and will still only cost you $28.<br /><br />In that sense it doesn&#039;t matter what the cost of the bitcoins. As long as you use them promptly you take no speculative risk.

				The only time it sucks is if you buy coins at $14 and then they drop to $10. A big change like that (in the negative direction) only happened once in the last year.

First it isn&#039;t widely accepted. It doesn&#039;t meet the definition of currency right there. Second, my mother couldn&#039;t use a bitcoin, but she could use a dollar, or any other national currency - she doesn&#039;t have the technical knowledge. Third, to get bitcoins most people have to go to a commodity exchange (mtgox.com) or pay a high fee to purchase to a broker that does that for you on mtgox. To &#039;cash out&#039; you have to do the same thing in reverse. That they use the word &#039;cash out&#039; tells you that bitcoins are not cash.<br /><br />There are other aspects to it. The way people use bitcoins resembles the tokens in gaming arcades. Sure, they have value, and you could probably sell them to people that go to the gaming arcade if you sold them for less than the arcade does. But it doesn&#039;t mean the game arcade tokens are widely accepted.
