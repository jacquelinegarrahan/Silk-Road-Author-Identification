				A recently placed order has not arrived yet and is a day from auto-finalizing. The vendor seems to be within good standing of the community (from what I&#039;ve seen on the forums and reviews) so I would be happy asking the resolution staff for a little extra time. From what I understand, I should be able to ask the resolution staff for extra time.<br /><br />So my question: is it possible to resolve an order so that the package can have a little extra time to arrive without negatively affecting my buyer statistics? If possible, I would be happy giving the package an extra week and if it finally comes in, to release full payment to the vendor.

It&#039;s good practice to put the issue into resolution a couple of days before auto-finalization if it hasn&#039;t arrived. I generally suggest a time extension of 5 days to my vendors. If they agree, this 5 days kicks in AFTER the auto-finalization date, so if there&#039;s 1 day left &#039;til auto-finalize and your vendor agrees to a 5 day extension then the auto-finalize will happen in 6 days, unless extended again.<br /><br />As I said it&#039;s good practice to put the item into resolution a couple of days before auto-finalize because it gives vendors a better idea of when they can expect their payment. A lot of vendors dislike people putting items into resolution so soon before auto-finalize but whatever you do, NEVER let it auto-finalize. Always work with your vendor to iron out any issues.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Orders do -not- auto-finalize after being put into the resolution center, the due date is when staff will see it again.

				I have used the resolution center one time was issued a 100% refund and this did not affect my buyer stats one bit, this may be necause the vendor involved had many other such transactions and was basically dishonest in the most obvious manner.

				If the vendor is unranked, would it be handled the same way? This is my first time using the resolution center and I&#039;d really rather pay him then mess up my stats. Is five extra days a good proposal?
