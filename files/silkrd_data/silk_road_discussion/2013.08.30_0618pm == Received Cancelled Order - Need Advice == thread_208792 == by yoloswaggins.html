				Title says it all. I received an order I had cancelled. Asking for advice as what to do. Should I inform the vendor? or act like nothing has happened? Do I risk anything by keeping my mouth shut (since he potentially kept my tracking info/address)?<br /><br />Thanks

				Contact the vendor. Vendor might give you a discount or time to pay. But don&#039;t ignore it. That could go badly for you.

				Vendor made a mistake, why not let them know If they have tracking info they will figure it out. You cancel the order,&nbsp; I would probably offer them 50% and remind them you didn&#039;t need to tell them about it. This is what most Vendors give customers for lost orders ( or see the vendors policy and honor what they would give you.&nbsp; If I cancelled an order and it still shipped I would be abit pissed as I would not be expecting anything so I would be subject to risk I was not aware of. If unsure use a different account to contact vendor to test the winds. You wouldn&#039;t want a pissed off vendor. Its not ;ike you can return the product and you should not have to pay for something you didn&#039;t order.<br /><br />

				If you are honorable you would msg vendor and probably send him the coin that you agreed upon in the first place. Drugs aren&#039;t free.. This is what I hope my customers would do.

				Do the right thing.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t need to be complicated. Either pay the vendor, offer to send it back(which I doubt he will give you his address), or offer to send it to his next customer for that item. You obviously aren&#039;t an asshole if you came here asking for advice, meaning you seem to want to do the right thing... so do the right thing.

				I would message him at least in case he thought he was sending it to someone else.<br /><br />But most likely the vendor will write it off as they definitely won&#039;t want you sending it back anywhere.

				More than message the vendor, get ready to pay them.&nbsp; You know full well that they didn&#039;t get it for free and are out some money for that... Due to timing you canceled when they shipped and now it got there, pay them asap!&nbsp; Seems this scenario is a problem in the SR system...

				Well you COULD just keep it and say nothing but that&#039;s not the right thing to do. If I were you I would send him the coins. Don&#039;t be a piece of shit ;D

				Good Faith is Exactly what keeps this place going. Plus one factor of being honorable, you get to stay a repeat customer and be potentially remembered as one who did the right thing when they did not have to. Stay honorable. Reap the rewards. Community.

				Vendors are here to try and be your friends, in a sense. They&#039;re not here to give you crazy stupid discounts and what not, but they are here to make you happy and get a repeat customer. You&#039;re probably going to be nervous purchasing from this vendor again, right?<br /><br />Nonetheless, contact your vendor, let them know you canceled an order and you had received it anyway. I don&#039;t know if you believe in karma, but I&#039;ve heard people who don&#039;t believe in karma say, &quot;What comes around, goes around.&quot; Or, &quot;you reap what you sow.&quot; Usually it&#039;s a good moral to live by. When it comes down to it, not sure how much the order was, but I&#039;m willing to guess around the 50$-100$ range. Is it worth your reputation? Is it worth your conscience? Maybe you can even send bitcoins to your vendor directly and quietly, and only you will know and it&#039;ll make you feel better.

				Just message them, explain the situation and offer to send them the cash for it. Definitely what comes around goes around and honesty is always the best policy, especially when it comes to drugs. What else do we have as operators of a black market besides our word. We cant exactly sue people who lie.
