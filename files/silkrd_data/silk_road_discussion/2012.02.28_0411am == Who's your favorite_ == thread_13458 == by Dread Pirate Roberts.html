				Hey DPR, you probably get this a lot, but you&#039;re awesome. You are my personal hero. Every time there is a problem or complaint with the site, you jump right on it and make it better for everyone involved. Stealth mode pleases the vendors, and this bookmarking thing should give people time to bookmark their favorites. Everyone wins&nbsp; 8)

Perhaps add a separate page for vendors to see who favors them with the names being links to the buyer&#039;s profile. And also add a &quot;favorited&quot; bulk message option so vendors can send out a message to all those who &quot;favorited&quot; them. <br /><br />Also a page that allows vendors to offer products to those who &quot;favorited&quot; them. This page can only be seen by those in the favorite list. And buyers who favorited the vendor can buy and add to cart from this page. <br /><br />

				@Ben - I sent a message to DPR last night with pretty much all of that in it (I assumed we would have access to the favorite list as vendors right off the hop, which is why I said I would be doing fan-only sales).&nbsp; If a bunch of us send it off and suggest it I&#039;m sure it&#039;s something that he would be happy to take a look at for us.<br /><br />Another thing that would be cool would be to implement a repeat-customer discount.&nbsp; I have been wanting to do something like this forever, built in to the system.&nbsp; Any customer that has purchased from you previously can qualify for X% discount, of your choosing.&nbsp; Kind of like Amazon where it shows regular price, $ savings (% beside), then actual price.<br /><br />I would be all over that in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Anarcho47

				Awesome feature. I&#039;m relatively new here (few months) and I hope that sellers aren&#039;t too quick to go into stealth mode and only sell to previous buyers. I can see how sellers can leverage this feature with an implementation of fan deals and previous buyers&#039; discounts. Thanks to the SR admins for continuing to improve the site.

				Very nice this balances out vendor/buyer oppurtunitys with the &quot;stealth&quot; feature. This way buyers that have done their research can keep good vendors for future purchases even if they go &quot;stealth&quot; .

				As it stands, does this basically mean if you can&#039;t see some of the sellers listings, you can click &quot;become a fan&quot; (providing they have public listings) to see all their content?<br /><br />If this feature is going to be utilized it needs to have a &quot;Fan for &lt;x&gt; months&quot; so sellers can offer different sorts of deals. <br /><br />Quite a nice idea except for the fact I&#039;ve now had to go and favorite all potential vendors that I might use.

				In the big leagues, my favorite is without a doubt Pharmville.&nbsp; Pretty much the gold standard, but that is not news to anyone here.&nbsp; Like clockwork you know when your package will arrive because you know when you ordered it.&nbsp; There is no wondering if or when your order was shipped, that would be as silly as wondering if an apple tossed into the air might fall back down.&nbsp; If you paid for it, you can bet your ass it has been shipped somehow from a time-machine and your past self has received it.&nbsp; That last sentence is only slightly in exaggeration.<br /><br />A good up-and-coming seller many may not know about is brownpurple31.&nbsp; They have been awesome in setting up custom listings and are among the most communicative and helpful vendors around.&nbsp; Not only have they been able to meet requests, they have also sent messages out to let me know they had recently stocked an item I&#039;d asked about in the past.&nbsp; That&#039;s the kind of personal touch only available from a dedicated vendor that remembers their clientele well (or at least cares enough about them to go back and re-read old messages).<br /><br />BTCpal is another favorite, a no-brainer when you need bitcoins.&nbsp; If you have to trust one person on SR right now with your moneypak, that one person for me is BTCpal.&nbsp; I still vividly recall a last-minute frantic effort to scrape bitcoins together when the big market sites failed me: BTCpal responded to my inquiry in detail in under 4 fucking minutes.&nbsp; No hidden fees, they are very upfront about wait times or queues if relevant, have impeccable communication skills, and are faster than any other way you could imagine practically.&nbsp; Many swear by SugarMama, but with all due respect, I&#039;m not paying 15% or more to wait the same amount of time it would take a BTC exchange with the added risk of losing all of the money if scammed.&nbsp; BTCpal is worth the premium over the exchange sites because they offer value beyond the exchanges in the form of speed and less connected paper trail.<br /><br />It&#039;s tough to pick favorites when the vast majority of vendors here wake up every day ready to get dirty and put work in to keep their clientele happy.&nbsp; It would be much easier to name our &quot;un-favorite&quot; vendors, though that would be the meanest thread ever.

				It&#039;s probably explained on the first page....<br /><br /><br />I like this however as I was &#039;favoriting&#039; various vendors a thought ocurred to me. I&#039;m more or less creating a relationship between my buying account and several vendors.<br /><br />This creates a bit of a conundrum because now I&#039;ve established some sort of &#039;relationship&#039; between myself and them and gives me pause when I think about how LE could potentially build a case against someone both vendor and/or buyer. How is this kept secure? I don&#039;t need/want details but some kind of possibly explanation as to how this is not potentially dangerous. If I&#039;m being overly paranoid then please by all means say so but otherwise I think this is a question worth asking.

				This system has now resulted in a multi-tier view of the SR marketplace. Today for example, the LSD section has only *one* listing. Now I know there are plenty more sellers out there, as I have them on my favourites list and am a regular customer -- they still have products. This is now less of an open marketplace, and I am not so sure that is a wonderful thing. Probably fine for the sellers, and fine for the regulars, but really blows for new people. One example: I was going to place an order with &quot;organicbuds&quot; but I had some issues with BTC transactions, so I left the item in my shopping cart to come back to. Two days later the seller has disappeared and the items ghosted. They may have genuinely left, but I suspect they merely went into stealth mode, and because I didn&#039;t have the forward thinking to become a fan of someone I&#039;ve never purchased from before I now have lost the ability to see their goods entirely. Sure, fine for the seller, but sure does lead to a disappointing market experience for everyone else.<br /><br />It&#039;s a tough call, and I&#039;m still on the fence about it myself. I enjoyed SR for the openness, but see it becoming even more like a gated society where the primary reason for using it is escrow. Seeing that many vendors opt to force buyers to immediately finalise transactions before shipping, even that becomes less valuable.

				Though I will rescind one of my points: my filter was set to &quot;domestic only&quot;, shit that I am, thus showing a dramatic reduction in listings. Ouch.

				I keep seeing people complaining about vendors going into stealth mode, but I&#039;ve yet to see evidence of any vendors doing this. <br /><br />Most people are simply confusing the situation where some vendors (for example Norcal420) just have no listings up at the moment.<br /><br />So, who is a vendor that has gone into stealth mode but still has listings up?

				I can definitely see the value of the stealth mode and the current evolution of SR. I see buyers and sellers being deceived and cheated, regularly. Not too many solutions, but it is natural for the quality buyers and sellers to match up somehow. The fan system, bookmarking, and stealth process gives us some tools with to work. It is uncomfortable for us newbies(i hate that word, btw) to develop a reputation, and evolve into the system, just like on the street, but tough shit. Thanks for keeping me away from downtown, guns, and giving me a product choice!

				Why don&#039;t you just put the S,R. back to how it was,i understand why some vendors want to go stealth but to newbie&#039;s or other new and old buyers they can&#039;t get the items that they are looking for which may make people go else where and then what would happen to the S.R.(probably go obsolete?).

				I will be setting up a sellers account soon - no prizes for guessing what I will sell! Plus some bud also as we keep top bud and the rest goes into oil.<br /><br />The friends feature is good in some ways - but it might work better if new customers have to do 5 transactions or spend a certain amount of bitcoin to be able to access hidden sellers or to be able to send a PM. I agree with hidden services as some retailers might have limited supplies and prefer to deal with a small customer base just like the real world. Unlike the real world - you are not strolling up to some dubious guy in a street and taking pot luck. <br /><br />I have only made 3 purchases so far - I like Ivory as your first buy is special! Plus - its great for the UK to get some legit MDMA and not some awful pills at 3 for five pounds! Pills that make you want to fight your mother - its not E!<br /><br />My appetite is whetted and I am a pot lover above all and cannot wait to try out the Afghan black hash - and the Moroccan unpressed hash - plus tasty slate and so on. Hash grown under the sun is my first love! And thanks to the guys here at SR for making it possible to buy decent hash without flying to the Dam and then only choosing hash from shops with a microscope to investigate! There are some good bargains with hash also - so I will fill my boots. Prices here are at a par with the Dam - and some cheaper especially if you tip the scales and buy more!<br /><br />The Chemical Brothers also - great service and look forward to the product.<br /><br />I know there are many here who want to sell quality produce and am sure there will always be enough dealing on the open market to satisfy the demand. <br /><br />Just to add - I been looking at LSD also and only saw one listing albeit using the filter for my own nation. <br /><br />There are so many things here I would like to try - and hopefully sellers will take on new customers as customers make enough purchases and pay up asap. I release the funds when the package arrives but as you build up some trust I would finalize early as a matter of courtesy unless its a big purchase! <br /><br />Thanks to the staff here. I have not got to know anyone yet but will read and contribute to the forums as and when I have something useful to say.<br /><br />Long live the Silk Road!

I&#039;ve tried ordering from this guy and he says he shipped the order but the tracking number he gave me doesn&#039;t exist. He says he had a bunch of order go out the same day as mine but yet not one review from anyone them about how his product is or was was never put on his vendors page. His strains change on a daily basis and yet his vendors page says he&#039;s only got 4 transactions and 5 reviews. LOL, I dont get that one either. How can 5 people give his products reviews if he&#039;s only got 4 transactions. I may be wrong but this vendor looks shady and wouldn&#039;t doubt this is either&nbsp; ascammer or maybe its even the law enforcement just tryin to get peoples name and addresses to who uses this site. Maybe I&#039;m just paranoid too. All I know is my order never came in and the tracking number he gave me is bogus. Wouldn&#039;t recommend anyone ordering from this vendor if they don&#039;t want their bitcoins tied up for days on for no reason.

				Being here for cannabis. I use two vendors. The finest in stealth, packaging and product...Has too be lionware trading Co (LTC). Their always heavy also. Their hash/oils are amazing. If I had too use one word for my experience using them on the Road, phenomenal. <br /><br />I also use MarlysMainMan. Their stealth and buds are not as good. However they are a good bunch to do business with. Again always heavy bags. communication is amazing, buds are always good. Just not the &quot;best&quot;.<br /><br />I recommend both vendors for cannabis. It&#039;s the only two I will FE with and use.
