				So I have been trying to grab a fake birth certificate from aussie vendor Blackie. He recently retired from SR, however, he agreed to make me one after I offered him $50. He was originally charging $5, which I thought was strange because I&#039;m sure he could have charged much more and still sell a lot. <br /><br />Blackie messaged me two days ago with this: <br /><br />Sorry I just cant complete your order.<br /><br />I sent you a payment as compensation for the inconvenience and me wasting your time.<br /><br /><br />He cancelled the order with a full refund and transferred me 200 bitcoins?! Seeing as he seemed like a nice guy I decided not to immediately blow it all on... blow. I messaged him back letting him know he may have made a mistake (maybe he meant to send me $200 instead) and that I will be happy to send him back the money.<br /><br />He replies with:<br /><br />Merry Christmas, mate. Wasn&#039;t a mistake.<br /><br /><br />I love SR :)<br />

				Possible he can&#039;t easily change coin back to currency that he can use and had to do something productive with it, or its possible he just wanted to do something nice for someone at christmas (although that is one of the nicest things I can imagine someone doing around here by far).<br /><br />Like someone else said, use it for good, make someones day :)

				That&#039;s awesome. Congrats!<br /><br />I remember this time last year, the Pharmville guys were a little late in getting an order out so Ben overnighted me a double order for free.&nbsp; <br /><br />Glad to see there are still awesome things happening on SR. <br /><br />There are some really awesome vendors out there. Another great vendor is OneStop. Always treats customer right. ;-)<br /><br />One guy that was really good back in the day was Davidd. He&#039;d always give you about 10-20% more than you ordered plus a sample of a different research chem in every order. Real shame what happened to him. <br /><br />Then there&#039;s Rocker. Really great shroom vendor who is just an awesome guy. A real asset to the SR community. <br /><br />All in all, there are some really great vendors on SR. Some really stand out and shine brightly.

				I wouldn&#039;t doubt this happens.&nbsp; It sounds to me like he didn&#039;t give a fuck about whatever BTCs he had in his wallet and just wanted to get out of the game, didn&#039;t care about cashing out his coins and sent them to someone random.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done some random acts of kindness like that IRL just &#039;cause.&nbsp; The OP in question just happened to be the lucky receiver of this generous act.

				Just sent nomad 8btc, asked him to post in this thread to confirm so hopefully he reads soon. Fred&#039;s vendor page is down so I have messaged him here to confirm he will be back and I can send his too. Moksha I&#039;m sure goes under a different name on SR so I will msg them through here before I send to the moksha account on SR as I think that might be the work of a quick-thinking smartypants. Pine, Guru and Animus Vox I know little about, except for the fact that they spend disgusting amounts of time helping people out while expecting nothing in return. If anyone can msg them or just direct them to this thread that would be awesome.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I cant find microrna and the only account on sr goes straight to message. All I know of him was that most people on the forums think he is a good guy who was unfairly dumped as a moderator. Nothing comes up when I search his name here, which is strange if he used to be a mod, am I spelling the name right?

				I appreciate the offer but give my share to someone else who has received nothing back from the community at all after being victim of a scam.<br /><br />MtlJohn stole money from me and stole money from others it appears after he got banned ( likely to fund his foray into MDMA which so far is a giant failure I see .. since he has no affiliations or credit, he needed the cash to make a buy ) but I have a page full of customers who have continued buying from me since this happened a few months ago.<br /><br />There are buyers that take money they worked for and came on here and got popped, they deserve a present more than me.

				Why is everyone so worried about whether it&#039;s real or not? <br /><br />If it&#039;s not real, it&#039;s not like the OP is asking for anything. He doesn&#039;t want MORE money. <br /><br />If it is real, then it&#039;s an awesome Christmas story and an act of generosity to counteract the many scams that appear on here. <br /><br />I for one am going to choose to believe it&#039;s real.

Wow... Okay, this really comes down to how connected you feel to the people you&#039;re giving to. The thousands of faceless children living in landfills outside of New Delhi obviously have less impact on your life than Silk Road moderators. So when you give to the latter, you see the &quot;impact&quot; you&#039;re making. You&#039;re also probably worried that a large percentage of your money gets diluted while en route to these needy people. A valid concern, but one that can be easily remedied by researching your desired charity. <br /><br />(Donating to local charities solves both of these problems.) <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96334.msg687185#msg687185">Quote from: karmawillgetyou on December 28, 2012, 06:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />Berate with your head not your heart.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br /><br />Wow, what a strong rebuttal.

Your response to my mention of basic economics is literally only the word &#039;wow&#039;, and then you go off on some silly irrelevant tangent regarding feelings. The fact that you bother mentioning charities skimming from the top makes it obvious you know very little about economics, but that&#039;s understandable, that&#039;s how it&#039;s supposed to be. Were you to think logically about the plight of the third world you would realise how not only futile but destructive third world charity and foreign aid actually is.<br /><br />https://mises.org/daily/1093<br />http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa065.html<br />http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1987628,00.html<br /><br />Charity and aid will not develop a country, a stable economy will. Charity and aid will always undermine a stable economy. I have no desire to have an ideological debate with you, if you want to pick fights on the internets you will have to look elsewhere, but if you would like a better understanding of why the world is the way it is I suggest you read up on economics. Sounds boring but it is really quite simple and interesting, especially when you quickly realise how corrupted our monetary systems are. I know I am quite happy with my original decision not to convert these bitcoins back into some corrupted fiat currency, much better for the whole world that way. Go bitcoin! <br /><br />Also all I knew about fred flintstone was that he was robbed of some coin a while back and recently helped out another member here with some cash, from that info I deemed him a suitable recipient. Turns out he doesn&#039;t need it and was nice enough to reject my offer. You need to relax guy and be more respectful of drug dealers/users and just humans in general, you are far too confrontational and hostile for a civilised society.<br /><br />
