				So before I do this, I sent my bit instant payment to my e-mail (the zip zap money gram receipt i believe) do I show this to the people at walmart to send to my silk road deposit address?

				Thanks for the response! And do I need to give them any ID or any real info about me if asked? I&#039;m simply mailing my USD to my silk road deposit address correct?

				After going through money gram, and Zip Zap a couple of times, I&#039;ve resigned myself to something much easier and with less face, camera, phone and store clerk interaction time.<br /><br />Buy MoneyPak card at Wallgreens or CVS. <br />Give information to Chronic Crew via feedback listing. <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5c4c6347a6<br />Have Bitcoins deposited directly to SR account.

				I did this just last week and you are pretty much correct. When you fill out your order you need a full name address and date of birth so I would do your best to come up with a fake persona and don&#039;t use names like John Smith or anything like that. If you can try to find a valid address within driving distance of your walmart to use just to be on the safe side. You can take the zipzap form directly to the walmart if you want, but just to make it seem more legit I grabbed a blue moneygram order form and filled out the information myself, the walmart clerk didn&#039;t even look at the zipzap printout just the blue form I filled out.<br /><br />Also you CAN use your SR deposit bitcoin address directly but I personally and a lot of others try to send it to an intermediary address first and then to SR. If you do this youll need to create an instawallet at a place like blockchain.info I think but this isn&#039;t absolutely mandatory either. I don&#039;t use instawallets for my intermediary addresses I ended up setting up an encrypted bitcoin client on my machine and using addresses in there because I had a bad experience with instawallets once where I nearly lost a few hundred bucks because their servers crashed and they had to reimport the entire block chain. <br /><br />EDIT: NEVER give them any ID if asked for it, tell them you lost your wallet and that is why you have to pay bills with cash using money gram. If they give you shit for it just take your moneygram order form and cash and find a new walmart.
