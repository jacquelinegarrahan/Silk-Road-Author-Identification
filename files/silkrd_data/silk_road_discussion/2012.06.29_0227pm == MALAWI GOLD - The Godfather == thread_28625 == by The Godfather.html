				You&#039;ll laugh at my naivete. When I first saw this thread, I thought it was about real gold from Malawi. I wondered what distinguished it from gold from anywhere else, heh.<br /><br />Darkwave

				I am interested in a few things as well.<br /><br />I will second wanting to see pictures. I am hesitant to order, seeing that the provided photos are from another website.<br />Is it sent flattened, or still in bud form?<br />What is your success rate with sending product to the USA?<br /><br />Also, after going through well over 20 pages of your reviews, I don&#039;t think that I have seen one review that indicates anyone receiving product. Do you have any reviews anywhere that can show your validity as a vendor? I am very interested in your Malawi, but with no reviews, and no response after four days of PM&#039;ing you, I am extremely hesitant to make an order. And as to finalizing early, your Terms and Conditions states that it is applicable for Lottery Tickets. Cannabis is not required to finalize early, is it?<br /><br />I mean no offense by my post, I just want to make sure I am putting my money in the right place.

				He makes it very clear that you are required to finalize early with his cannabis. He says his feedback does the talking, I guess that&#039;s true because he hasn&#039;t said much to anyone about our questions.

				I am the user poiZEN from the main site and I took part to the iPad lottery of OP. This was the one only time I used the address that was partly posted on the &quot;Team Snitch&quot; thread. So I&#039;d recommend you better don&#039;t buy from this vendor.
