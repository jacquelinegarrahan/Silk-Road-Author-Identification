				I personally think that DPR is not greedy. If you think about what you are paying the SR staff for it should be worth it. Especially after all the hard work staff have put in after the attacks, scammers and other threats (such as that guy posting addresses.) As well as the constant support and just the whole concept. I understand the fees are quiet high at the moment but I see them dropping down soon, hopefully.

				If he paid somebody off, he made a really questionable choice.&nbsp; It&#039;s anonymous.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#039;t the guy just come back and do it again -- you can&#039;t give in to demands like that.&nbsp; I mean it just basically isn&#039;t an option, if you do it once you&#039;ll have two more people plus the original guy coming &#039;round and demanding even more this time.

To do&nbsp; the same would involve creating 20 accounts and paying the full price and commission each time which could become very expensive if they catch you.<br /><br />Not saying scammers don&#039;t exist there but the right tools exist on Atlantis to better keep them at bay.

I don&#039;t why, but in my opinion becoming a vendor here means that you intent and have thought about how to make profit. I believe that the fact that the registration fee is high, keeps scammers away. I don&#039;t trust Atlantis for that. Giving 25 dollars to become a vendor? Hm, don&#039;t know, I believe it can be easy for people to fool others. I am sure that vendors may disagree with that point of view, but from the customer perspective, I find it easier to trust vendors who actually have invested on it.<br /><br />Just saying :)<br /><br />Adamiz
