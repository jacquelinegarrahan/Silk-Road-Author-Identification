				So im wondering the startup costs required to become a Vendor. i know about the original $500 fee, But how much cash do you reckon you would need to spend on product to start off with, None of the money would be spent all would be doubled or whatever and put back into the business. do you reckon $1000 would manage it? On top of that i will have access to a Key of Weed in around 2 months or so that i wont need to pay for. <br /><br />just looking for some advice from some experienced vendors. <br />thanks for all your help<br />Hff

				You need vac seal machinery, shipping materials, postage, baggies, gloves, sanitizing solution, and maybe labels too. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re selling, but 1000 dollars would be what I&#039;d be prepared to spend BEFORE buying product to sell on here.

Shipping materials to start up i would say might cost me around 200 dollars, I could purchase more once i had made my first couple purchases.

However im still fairly new to it, but for the amount of sales il probably have in he first month it wont need to be extensive. <br />Fuck paying taxes on money earned from SR, it would have to be some laundering method where i ratted it out somehow. <br /><br />ahh inflation, the killer. <br /><br />Thanks for your advice all, this is the start of me looking into becoming a seller so i apologize if i dont seem very savvy yet.

Just somewhere i could ask about things i would need advice with. basic things such as going over best ways of cashing out, help with best methods of packaging, of course i can find my own ways out, However it&#039;s always good to get some feedback before sending anything out, i would not want to compromise my customers security with shitty packaging. <br /><br />Thanks

				MBB is sold on the silk road, and I think vac seal machines are sold on the road, but as someone else said earlier, they not a requirement due to MBB. Its a big plus though.<br /><br />You need to exist as a vendor for 6 weeks, sell 1200 USD worth of product, have 30 transactions, and have had your vendor bond refunded before you can enter the vendor forums, and your silk road user name must be the same as your forums name.

				I would suggest if your serious and want to make an impact, make use of the forums and plan and launch at the same time.<br /><br />Then I would as someone above suggested spend 1000$ for decent vac machine and and all the other postage appendage&#039;s required.<br /><br />Then you might want to prepare for an influx of orders, I would suggest spending as little on stamp postage ect as you possibly can at first, and by any means of dont go out and buy a million stamps at A first buy.<br />I personally&nbsp; would at first spend less than&nbsp; 200$ in stamps or maybe even less, if you got ready cash to go buy them from postal shops. <br /><br />Then start to practice on how to deal with customer support, if you want me to test your wits!.<br /><br />I will haha.&nbsp; ;D

				DO NOT GO FREE BY ANY MEANS!.<br /><br />There ain&#039;t no such thing as a free lunch. <br /><br />And any free label site&#039;s out there is a cache for your info.<br /><br />Go spend some decent money on a label printer but also make sure you source one cheap from eBay with a cheaper supply of labels. <br /><br />I made the mistake of buying a high end label printer had it a month, paper jam episodes all the way. <br /><br />So make sure you get a good cheap one there ain&#039;t no difference in one that cost 1000$ or one for 50$ they ALL print on the same thermal paper so don&#039;t get fooled, by the micro second speeds they promise you.<br />You wont be that busy. <br />So i recommend a Brother QL-500 cheap cheerful fast and reasonable label prices.<br />If anyone knows a better label solution I want to know it!. :).<br /><br />

				Thats the million dollar question all vendors want to answer and give an answer too, it basically boils down to this:<br /><br />A good memory for user names, using the ROUNDTABLE area wehn you are granted access, DUE dilligence a Spark of GUT feeling in ur tummy, and above all patience and a wider understanding of scammers and there workings, so take note of there stats, a low losable order you can live with.

				&nbsp;Well I think $1000 is enough, that vendor fee sounds ridiculous. The biggest mistake newbie sellers make IMO is they think they can start small, offer limited services, and build up.

The answer is that you have to be bigger then them! You have to offer superior product, and we have legit MD farmers here on SR so there is a lot to live up to. Wait until you have the funds to allow shipping everywhere, with different options (ie. Stealth, tracking, etc.). Then sell cheap!

However the reason i wanted to start &quot;small&quot; i say small , however i mean relatively small as in domestic only to start until first couple of weeks are over etc. <br />as long as my product is superior, Shipped domestic, cheaper which there is a lack of where im from, I reckon i&#039;ll be fine. <br />if you think about it, There&#039;s no way to compete with bigger vendors until you are bigger yourself, they have feedback , you dont until you make some sales. they have been selling for a while therefore have experience you dont, And they have more money because they have been selling longer. <br />nyways thanks for your advice mate. <br /><br />Il speak soon, probably tomorrow.

				To answer your question, you can get free shipping labels at any post office, I don&#039;t know what country you&#039;re in though so it may be different. Labels shouldn&#039;t be expensive anyways.<br />I also recommend MBB, especially for weed and vacuum sealing is a bit useless unless you want it to be compressed or if it can rot. Vacuum sealing or not, if it&#039;s sealed, the odor doesn&#039;t get out.

				Expect an average of 2-3 weeks worth of sales in escrow, expect buyers lying about not getting their orders. Expect it to take a long time to turn bitcoins into cash and that it will cost you.<br /><br />You will need to be able to afford about a month&#039;s shipping before the money starts coming back.

So is there some kind of answer to this? How can a vendor prove 100% that he shipped a package and it was delivered? prepaid envelopes have tracking but you can&#039;t print a label. they come with pre-attached labels that you have to fill out by hand. this demands time, has possible errors, and most buyers seem to think it&#039;s a bad thing (the hand written label) <br /><br />So apart from examining every buyer who posts and order (more time consuming behavior) you still might be scammed. <br /><br />Is this why prices are so high? So many scams that vendors price so high that 50% refund, or a reship is still a profitable sale? Does this in turn lead to vendors offering private sales (custom etc) for repeat / good buyers at a reduced cost? <br /><br />Any ideas on how to get around this problem? As a potential (hopefully soon) vendor I find this to be troubling. There is a lot of focus on buyer protection. But I&#039;m more concerned about my protection. I do honest business, my group does honest business. We aren&#039;t &quot;yo&quot; kids. We believe in professionalism and good business. If someone makes a buy they get what was offered at the price quoted. Dealing with 2 week holds on funds, resolution, proof of shipping, &quot;i didn&#039;t get nothing&quot; and all that. I mean shit, it&#039;s all adding to the cost. I can see why coke, weed, meth, MDMA, and roids are so damn expensive here. <br />

				I&#039;d say you should plan for more than that. As other people mentioned why are people going to go with you instead of someone more established? What I did to remedy that was give out samples and it worked very well. So if you do something like that, I gave away a little over 2oz so factor in your cost for something like that if you wish to do so. The other costs people already covered so I won&#039;t. O, but a printer can be better than a label maker, it will print many more at a time and it&#039;s just as easy to use. So maybe find a decent printer. <br /><br />I believe it cost me around $1300 but you can make it back fast if you have the right stuff.

When are you able to basically say fuck off , I mean sometimes fair enough, But let&#039;s say it&#039;s obvious a buyer is trying to scam some more free shit out of you, But at the same time, You dont want him to leave shitty feedback because feedback on here is just as good as having premium product,You Need it. Any advice at all mate?<br />thanks for your input as well. <br />You seem pretty stressed about the whole thing, Which i understand due to the amount of work you must be putting in. does it really start to get on top of you? especially if you are a one person operation. <br /><br />thanks for helping everyone, your input is valued and appreciated. I shall remember everyone who helped me here today .&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No stress, we just work it into the cost of business. We rarely deny a refund even to an obvious scammer. What we do is start requiring FE from the city. We had to do this with Austing TX before, but the scammers gave up once we put the policy in place and have not really had to enforce it.<br /><br />For every scammer that you never deal with again there are 2 or 3 good repeat customers.<br /><br />My point was that you need to be pessimistic about how much profit you will make, add wiggle room into your business model.<br /><br />Be prepared for bitcoins to change in value while you are waiting to turn it into cash. The drop from $200 would have really hurt us if we were not cost averaging our bitcoins.

				If you believe 1000$ is enough, you better get 2000$. Vac seal, bags,gloves,different envolopes,a printer, anony prepaid credit card, shipping materials and most of all you need knowledge. You need to read these forums inside-out to develop knowledge on current/recent scam attempts and shipping techniques. If you get less then top shelf product be prepared to go broke, real quick. Scammers will claim short count or no delivery if its bad stuff. If you dont comply theres a 1/5 brother. Good luck, its time consuming but worth while.

Vendor A notices that you B are now a vendor - well he has your address and name and whatever else. He could exploit that in many ways.

				You can claim your vendor bond back, once you have fulfilled the certain requirements, dont worry about that as you are not set up yet,&nbsp; but go scroll down to end of your silkroad page select support then click the link to FAQ. <br /><br />Its up to date and i recommend you should spend some time there reading it.&nbsp; <br /><br />As all should do.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; !<br /><br />Buyers or vendors alike, its subject to change at any time!.<br /><br />Regards UK Stealth.<br />
