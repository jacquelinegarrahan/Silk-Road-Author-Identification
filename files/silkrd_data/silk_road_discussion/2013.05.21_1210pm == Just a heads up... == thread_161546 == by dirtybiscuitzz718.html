				Hey every one, just a heads up that the newb member Joker2000, is in fact the shill account ilovedrugs2001, that just tried to run a ridiculous btc scam in a thread. <br /><br />Libertas has locked it down, but I seen &#039;joker2000&#039; made a thread stating hes $300 short for getting his vendor account. So, if he manages to do so, beware of fuckery. <br /><br />&nbsp;Aside from the thread offering to sell outside of SR, and stating that hes short of coin to get his legit seller account, my only other evidence of this idea was the post i just seen of his in the &#039;free btc&#039; thread in the newb section. His post was simply..&#039;ilovedrugs&#039;. that coupled with the number similarity of the two nyms. I didnt bother to check the time stamps of all this, but im sure they would all coincide with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;Stay diligent people, see something.. say something. Much love

				Hey Onionman..<br /><br />thanks dude. In all honesty this was just a hunch, but in all my years, ive always been a firm believer in the fact that in life, there really arent any coincidences,<br />only probability. <br /><br />&nbsp;Ive been ok. keeping my head above water. Im just coming down off a 50+hour meth fueled, virus removal spree. I had some real nasty malware thinking it could get away with rooting and fuckery in my system. lol<br /><br />&nbsp;Any way, much love bro.
