				I&#039;d really like to sell my product [great quality btw] at a good price but the fee is really a bump in the road. Can someone give me a good idea on how to start. Could work in about 2 weeks for the sign up fee but could ship the product in 2 days.

				If you have a quality product, and a good head for bis you can make as much as you want on SR, don&#039;t sweat the fee.

				If you can code a site like this and this secure along with having such a huge community and customer base then by all means please do but a 150$ fee or w/e it is now isn&#039;t that much for the opportunity to sell on this type of site.

				So you aren&#039;t just being cheap then and you don&#039;t just expect that DPR created SR just for the sheer bum-fluffery of it? Get real or GTFO.&nbsp; ???

Post those in the &quot;Product Offers&quot; section and provided you&#039;re good at what you do, you&#039;ll start to get a steady stream.<br /><br />I think the vendor fee in part keeps the riff-raff out. If it was free, you&#039;d have every tom, dick and harry trying to pawn their medicine closet (and getting busted in the process).

				In the real world you need to make investments if you&#039;re going to start a business. If you start your own website you would need to pay for a domain name, hosting, coding, maintenance, etc. <br /><br />And like they said already, it helps keep the scammers out.

				If it was free to make a vendor account this place would be full of people getting ripped off by fake sellers. Every vendor posting would be about &#039;mtgix&#039; and the great deals there. SR would suck.<br /><br />$150usd is incredibly cheap for the ability to utilize the tools we have been offered to conduct our business. Even a proper lemonade stand is going to cost $150 to get rolling.
