				I put up $500 in order to hedge against damage I may cause as a seller.<br /><br />If a seller account wasn&#039;t on trial at the time of server seizure, why were those _deposits_ not automatically released? There&#039;s no more use for them; they should have been retained like any other balance.<br /><br />I&#039;m frustrated after reading that many had their balances [automatically] transferred to their emergency addresses. Where&#039;s the discrimination coming from?

				Who has received BTC to their backup address? I had a backup address and nothing has been received despite the fact that I had close to 3BTC in my wallet at the time the feds took the site down.

				Nobody has confirmed that money has been sent to the backups. It is people that know people. no trusted person or even any person has stated this directly. The backup system will not work if dpr was arrested as they physical access. It was in the event the site was down he could trigger it remotely.

				As long as we go forward, the loss is miniscule.&nbsp; balls sucked into my chest when i went to check orders.&nbsp; We all have to move on and it will be ok. It is times like these i wish we applied for roundtable access, it seemed unneeded prior to this. They dont understand how much some vendors, if not most actually lost.<br /><br />PS:<br />If any other vendors can fill me in on anything that&#039;s going on at the table it would be appreciated as we are kind of out of the loop of nay future plans.
