				Hello ,<br />Thank you for taking the time to read this , I was told that once i reached the magic number of 35 transactions with 100 score , I can get access to a vendors forum , and I can now ask poor history buyers to FE is this correct as i do not want to get it wrong , took a lot of effort to get my business to where it is . I just want to know what it means for me now as a vendor , now i have over 35 transactions? <br />Kind regards <br />RP

				It is 55 for the vendor forums<br /><br />You can ask people to FE but I have only ever done it once. The guy had a 60% auto-finalization rate and a 40% return rate with 30+ transactions. When I told him he would have to FE, he asked to cancel his order.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Best to leave all you can in escrow and not worry about it.

				They will look at the types of goods that you provide. if you are selling drug baggies and cigarette paper, you wont make the cut.<br /><br />you more or less have to be selling controlled substances or their analogs to be considered.

				I am a new vendor as well, and hope to one day be allowed to enter the exclusive club, but I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t go about making posts demanding access.&nbsp; I think the vendors forum is more of a privilege, not a right.

				access will come in time, for now just concentrate on getting them orders out, creating threads about it will not help, it may just make you wait longer.
