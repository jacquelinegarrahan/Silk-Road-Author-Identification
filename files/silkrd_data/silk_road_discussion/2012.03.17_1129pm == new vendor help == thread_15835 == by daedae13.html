				haha well, you asking for a hell of a lot there! the best thing you can do is to take some time and read through the forums THOROUGHLY as pretty much every question and situation has been addressed on here by someone at some point so everything you need to know, you will find there.<br />&nbsp;First off, in order to help ya better, I would need to know what you plan on selling as this would effect your pricing, your packaging, where your main clients will come from, and so on.....<br />&nbsp; but I can offer a few tips that come to mind; first, get yourself known under your vendor name in the community you will be serving (so if you sell H, introduce yourself in the H vendor forums, if you sell blow, introduce yourself in the cocaine vendors forum, etc) and then when you are ready to open up shop and start selling, figure out who the respected members are in that forum and offer to send out 5 or 10 free samples to these people and in return, ask them to post their review of it. This is the best way to get your name out to everyone and to show that you are legit and, if you have a good product and good service, will make people interested and comfortable in buying from you. This is what I did when I first started and I literally didnt get a single order until those people posted their reviews and since the reviews were all by respected members and were positive, the orders started coming in. Then its a cycle of people posting more good feedback and reviews and more orders coming in. Another thing to do is to check out the forums daily to keep current on the whos and whats of your industry (weed,coke,heroin,etc) and to catch any negative issues right away before they get out of control (which happens EXTREMELY fast on here when left unanswered!the gossip in this place is 10x worse than high school!!) last tip i will give for now is to make sure to answer your SR inbox asap, especially in the begining! most people you will find are incredibly in patient and paranoid and if they go 18 hours without hearing back, they will either buy from someone else, or, if they have already bought and are waiting for a pkg or something, they will start screaming `SCAMMER!!`to anyone who will listen and will wallpaper the forums claiming you screwed them and disappeared, even if in reality you just havent been able to check your inbox for a day, they dont care! so make sure to answer your inbox as fast as possible, its always important but is critical when starting out!<br />&nbsp;Hope that helps and when I know what your selling, will offer more info if I can think of any!<br />&nbsp;Good luck and stay honest!! theres a lot more money to be made here by having good product then by making a fly by night operation and disappearing!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)
