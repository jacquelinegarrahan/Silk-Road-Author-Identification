				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I guess the state of affairs at SR with all the bitcoin devaluations and scamming on both sides of the aisle has made things such that an awful big percentage of the SR population feels the need to send a pm each day to find out if their order is going to ship that day.&nbsp; <br /><br />The problem with this is that I am receiving so many of those type of messages that it&#039;s impossible for me to send out the pm&#039;s I really want and need to, which are: ones that would help get your order shipped.<br /><br />So, when you order from Pharmville, if you don&#039;t get a pm from me saying I need some info or there&#039;s a payment issue or that we ran out of stock, we&#039;re just going to take your order and ship it.&nbsp; Right away.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really want to be polite and helpful and give everyone an answer so I&#039;m just going to have to receive fewer pm&#039;s if that&#039;s going to happen in a timely fashion.&nbsp; Our PGP has been out for a month now and I haven&#039;t been able to finish properly getting it fixed because I&#039;ve never been able to catch up on all the pm&#039;s and go out and get it done.&nbsp; And I and Ben are honestly giving this project every waking hour of every day already, we can&#039;t give it more time because there isn&#039;t any.&nbsp; And we can&#039;t just hire more people because we are very high profile here now and that would be really bad for security.&nbsp; And if we get busted then nobody gets an order and that&#039;s not so hot either, right?<br /><br />So if you have a real issue, question or concern, pls send me a pm and I will answer it in the time period which I think is appropriate, which is 4-6 hours except on weekends when maybe 12 is the max.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve got to receive less pm&#039;s if I&#039;m going to give that kind of service.&nbsp; I sometimes have a dozen or more pm&#039;s from the same person when I send their shipping confirmation for an order that arrived to our store less than 24 hours ago.&nbsp; This is just unnatural.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I&#039;m not complaining, I like giving good customer service, talking with buyers and solving problems.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually the thing I like to do most in life vis a vis work.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not a matter that I don&#039;t WANT to answer your pm, I just simply can&#039;t get to it because there are so many and they start to just crowd each other out and finally I just don&#039;t have any idea what to do with them so I just start answering the last one sent because then at least someone is getting good service.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ok, that&#039;s my rant, so to speak.&nbsp; I will continue to try to answer all pm&#039;s that are sent.&nbsp; But when it takes me 9 days to get to a guy who is saying that I don&#039;t respond quickly enough it sort of enters bizarro land because there&#039;s really no point in answering that pm any longer is there?&nbsp; He&#039;s right but telling him so won&#039;t help him and taking time to do that will keep me from responding to someone else who is still newly arrived in the pm box.&nbsp; <br /><br />All I can say is: I want to give you great service.&nbsp; Help me help you by only pm&#039;ing if it&#039;s truly necessary.&nbsp; You will be happier, you will get your reply more quickly, and your order will go out faster because Ben doesn&#039;t pack it unless I&#039;ve marked it to ship and if there&#039;s an issue that prevents it from shipping and I can&#039;t get to pm&#039;ing the person to ask the question...then it turns into just a bad situation.&nbsp; Believe me that I want to ship every person that orders within 24 hours.&nbsp; That is our goal and that&#039;s what we do every day and *most* of the time that&#039;s what happens and it doesn&#039;t require any kind of pm to cause it...it will just happen because that&#039;s what we want to do for you. :)<br /><br />BTW, I know that we have sold Opana in the past.&nbsp; I know that everyone loves it.&nbsp; I know that it is expensive and that it builds a huge tolerance very quickly.&nbsp; I also know that it is becoming impossible to source with any sort of regularity.&nbsp; Even when I can get them the amounts are so small that they would only serve to irritate the people who saw it listed but didn&#039;t have BTC in their acct at that moment to order it.&nbsp; So until I can get some real supply on it, we&#039;re not going to have any and I don&#039;t have any idea when that may happen.&nbsp; I think every person who used to supply me Opana started snorting it themselves and now they just supply one customer. ;) <br /><br />As always we really appreciate your business and we will do our very best to give you great products at great prices with quick delivery. :)<br /><br />thanks,<br />Alex

				Totally reasonable, but don&#039;t you think it&#039;s reasonable for a buyer to wonder what&#039;s going on when his order has been &quot;processing&quot; for over 72 hours? Especially when you guys promise shipping within 24 hours? Its totally fine if you can&#039;t get orders out in 24 hours, but when you say you will and you don&#039;t, you shouldn&#039;t expect people not to wonder what&#039;s up and PM you about it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for being a great seller, but buyers (at least in my case) are only PMing when their orders sit for longer than you say they will.

				Add themunchies to that list. If it has been 24 hours and you&#039;re STILL asking me if your order is going to ship today, just don&#039;t. I will stop answering those questions. It takes 5 minutes to open PMs sometimes with TOR in the first place. Especially if you order friday or saturday....<br /><br />Time wasters....<br /><br />Hey Alex and Ben: Where are my fucking opana bitches? Nah I love you guys. I&#039;m about to send you an order for my benzos. You know I need them to answer all these questions...:D

				I gotta say, from my experience, there&#039;s no reason to PM Pharmville or Paperchasing until at least 5-6 days AFTER the order switches to in transit.&nbsp; They&#039;re both completely trustworthy and will take care of business as fast as humanly possible.&nbsp; Both these sellers are great assets to SR, and people should give them the time/space they need to read urgent messages, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done it myself (not messages about if the order shipped, but general questions about the product ordered), and felt kinda bad afterwards about wasting their time.&nbsp;

				Sellers have four days to pack + ship before it is cosiderd late.&nbsp; A buyer messaging about it after that seems reasonable but messaging sellers a day later asking when it&#039;s gonna ship is just impatient.&nbsp; Sellers are no robots.
