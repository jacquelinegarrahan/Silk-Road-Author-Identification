				Not sure what to get for that special someone?&nbsp; Want to let them know you REALLY care?&nbsp; How about getting them a Silk Road gift code!&nbsp; Convert any amount from your available account balance into a Silk Road gift code and give it to whomever you like.&nbsp; Then they can use it when checking out toward their purchase.&nbsp; You may create a code that can be used site-wide, or you can create one for a specific vendor.<br /><br />Vendors, this is also a great way to give store credit to your customers you find most deserving.&nbsp; Just create the gift code with your username and give the code to your customer.<br /><br />To create a gift code, click the &quot;Gift codes&quot; link from your account page.&nbsp; From there, enter the amount of the gift code, and the vendor it can be used with.&nbsp; If you leave the vendor field blank, the gift code will be useable site-wide.&nbsp; Once created, the code and value will appear at the bottom of the page until the gift code is all used up.<br /><br />Have fun!&nbsp; 8)

				would be nice if it could be narrowed by section also, instead of just vendor/whole site. maybe someone would be inclined to give out gift codes for anyone in, say, the LSD section. then the code could be used on tony&#039;s or MITANOX&#039;s acid, but not tony&#039;s smack or MIT&#039;s molly. NOT that I have anything against H or molly, it&#039;s just that there is a very warm spot in my heart for LSD.

It&#039;s funny because just last week me and like 10 of my friends took some molly and we all ended up in this huge group hug together and loving each other, so that&#039;s what your post reminded me of. <br /><br />Anyways, this is a great idea! Too bad I don&#039;t know anyone that actually uses the Silk Road because this would be the perfect gift for me! Something else this can help with: when forum members come in asking for like half a bitcoin or whatever, we can now buy them store credit to make sure that they&#039;re not just going to make off with the bitcoin and never return. At the very least their loan will be tied to the site. Excellent idea!

SR is an invaluable service which is used by people of all walks of life, all races, countries all over the globe,&nbsp; multiple languages, and even LE per their personal needs (as indicated from a Canadian Border Services Agent who buys pain killers for his back or whatever). Point being you have made getting drugs safe from violence and also allowed us access to the highest quality and purity drugs in all of the world! I would love to meet you in real life but unfortunately that will never happen. Or maybe it has by some freak chance but we will never know! I hope you keep safe, secure and very anonymous. Im sorry if it sounds like I&#039;m a crazy fan. I dont idolize you or anyone for that matter; I just want to thank you and let you know that I think what you&#039;ve done for us all is just plain n simple: GREAT! And maybe it&#039;s the weed n oxy but I you deserve a big pat on the back! And a man hug too my brother. Live long and prosper!

				This is pretty sexy. Can we expect this feature to show up on The Armory? Really helps out people who are too stupid to handle a bitcoin wallet of their own.<br /><br />If stupid people are excluded from any market, that market is pretty much doomed as most people are stupid. Opening up the marketplace to stupid people will create a huge influx, but also, creates new problems. Stupidly Dangerous now becomes a more common encounter...

				DPR you should make the gift code thing as an option in the resolution center so refunds can be given in store credit so to speak :)

				i dont agree, i think in some situations store credit can be a good option, like if something gets damaged in the post, the buyer still has the product but isnt 100% happy cos 1pill out of 10 got crushed for example, you can then offer 25% store credit off there next purchase to make up for the damaged one. big retail stores do this all the time.

				A little off topic, but whoever thought up, set up or designed Silk Road is an absolute pioneer and genius! Thanks to it&#039;s founders, you have liberated thousands, perhaps millions of people like me who feel paranoid when ordering online. From the title &#039;Silk Road&#039; (Marco Polo&#039;s trading route journey?), the logo and most of all the freedom, you guys deserve to have your dreams come true like you are making dreams come true for others. You saw the future and seized it. Thank you so much - Silk Road is the gift that keeps on giving!

				i think vendors should be given a free gift voucher each month (amount depends on sales) to allow them to purchase without paying commission on buys, if you sell and item then you get charged 10% then if you buy with them same coins (like many do) you get hit with a 10% fee again... this dont seem fair, thoughts?&nbsp;

Imagine, if you will, a vendor who practices selective scamming. He claims to send you a package but never does. In the resolution center, he blames it on the mailman. He offers you a 50% of the purchase price in store credit and promises to give you a little extra on your next order. Oh boy, what a stand-up guy! Yo you make another order, which, again, he doesn&#039;t send. This time, he&#039;s so embarrassed that the mailman misplaced his package a second time that he gives you a 100% refund! But what actually happened is that you lost 150% of the original order&#039;s value, and all you have to show for it is credit with an untrustworthy fellow. Money that you should own, but is actually locked to him.<br /><br />Not cool.
