				Hello, I know guys can have an issue receiving BTC to their SR wallet after a certain amount of time. How often would you recommend getting a new SR wallet address, to avoid missing a deposit? Mine is only about 45 days old or so.

I tend to make less frequent deposits, usually of an amount large enough to last a couple months or so. Better to be safe than sorry, when dealing with several hundred USD at once. That being said, is there a time period I should wait to let the new address &quot;take affect&quot; before I send a deposit to it? Thanks.

				nah, when you generate a new address, it&#039;s a unique identifier thats fresh, and completely unused.&nbsp; You can send coins to it right away (of course the network will still have to confirm the transaction, like any other transaction).<br /><br />The idea is to seperate your usage pattern from the addresses involved.&nbsp; If you use each address only once, there is no pattern to be discerned.&nbsp; If you use the same address twice, thats a pattern, and if you use the same address all the time, then your activity is tightly linked to that address.

I&#039;m just going to generate a new address a few hours before I make deposits from now on. Like I said, I only make deposits every 6-8 weeks or so.

				I have started getting a new one before each deposit.<br /><br />Just remember that the old one ceases to work when you request a new one

				that is not correct, even after generating a new address the old one is still valid and can be used<br /><br />however, it does seem occasionally old addresses do have issues and the deposit may not go through as quickly or require contacting support before it is deposited. <br /><br />quote below from the wiki @ http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Bitcoin<br /><br />&quot;You can generate any number of addresses (public keys) for a wallet and any previous address matching a wallet can be used for that wallet.&quot;

				What happens to any BitCoins in your wallet if you generate a new address?<br /><br />I have 1.18 BTC in my wallet, not really enough to buy anything I want. I will be making a new deposit soon. If I generate a new wallet address do I lose those BTC that are already there, are they transferred to the new wallet or is the wallet always the same and just the address changes?

They will be added in with your deposit once it has gone thru to your SR account.
