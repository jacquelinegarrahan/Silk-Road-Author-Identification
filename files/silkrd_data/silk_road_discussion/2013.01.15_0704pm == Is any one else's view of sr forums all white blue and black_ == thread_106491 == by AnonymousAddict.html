				I changed my AVatar to the BTC, Then i wanted to change it back to my old one and it says &#039;size is to big or not a avatar&#039; but iv had it on here almost 3 weeks, the black and white avatar i was using. Now the whole SR forums are in a different looking format /Iv had this happen before but after refreshing or after closing and re opening it would go back to normal but not as of now.. IM bout to try something else I just wanted to know if any one else is haveing this issue?

				This same exact thing just happened to me. I couldn&#039;t find the file size/resolution requirements searching on the forums, so I just resized a small file to 65x65 like the default avatars that you can choose from. I&#039;m pretty sure we broke it...
