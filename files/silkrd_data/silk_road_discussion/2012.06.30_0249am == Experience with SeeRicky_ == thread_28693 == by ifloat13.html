				Has anyone done Moneypak for BTC through &quot;SeeRicky&quot;? I used to use SR a lot to order Psychadelic, but no longer remember my login, so I have a new account. I contacted and set up a deal with SeeRicky for BTC, and it&#039;s only been a day, but there are several things about the situation that makes me feel uneasy now and very sketched out. I will save details etc for when I know for sure either way (perhaps I&#039;m being paranoid, and I truly hope that that&#039;s the case), but I&#039;d like to hear experiences if anyone has the time. Thank you.

				I use BTCMaster. No fees and usually gives you better than mtgox rate. Transaction takes less than 5 min and the coins are in your account.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26687.0<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7bdda04d8b<br /><br />Just send him a message on Silk Road and he will take care of you.

				His MP seem to be a lot more reliable than his drug sales.<br /><br />There have been multiple complaints about him on here, especially recently. There are reasons to believe he is tied to a previous scammer named Missit (both had similar scamming patterns and apparently are from the same small town)<br /><br />If you feel like pushing your luck, go for it. You could be in good hands with MP&#039;s unless he decides to go full-on scammer. However, it would be beneficial to the SR community as a whole to find another person for your MP&#039;s. Please don&#039;t help finance a known scammer! <br /><br />Thanks :)
