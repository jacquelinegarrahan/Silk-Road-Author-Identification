I assure you colors and hand signs are in no way indicators of grit. Shit just a few years ago, some little fuckers like you waving their red flags and shouting nonsense came around my way looking for, shit idk what they where looking for, but what they found was three italian guys that wasnt trying to hear any of THAT shit..

				Any serious, hard core, gang would be happy to have you. Just tell them about running away from the homosexuals that were hitting on you because you only outnumbered them 2 to 1. And the part about being rescued by the police as well. Don&#039;t forget that part.

				I&#039;m with dirtybiscuitzz718. The only reason street gangs still use hand signals, colors, and all that other shit is to give those weak-minded individuals a reason to be there. Without the tradition and theatrics, half of those gang members would be wandering around aimlessly with no sense of belonging. That &quot;family&quot; feeling is vital to them, while most of the leadership either answers to organized crime or is just using the gang tradition to recruit. Old school members may genuinely respect the tradition, but they aren&#039;t exactly stereotypical gang banger dickheads that start trouble with the wrong people.

				Slip/ Giggles that is awesome! <br /><br />I watched a documentary on gangs a while back, the &#039;induction&#039; seems much more interesting than the warring rivals day in day out bs, meh I&#039;d rather watch Spartacus.<br /><br />The induction however, would you be prepared to live stream your induction, wear a ski mask for anon if you must? If it&#039;s goes too far you can be An Hero and if not, I&#039;ve always wanted to see someone get a rusty needle full of AIDS jabbed into their pupil, it would almost be for scientific purposes to see how quickly you An Hero yourself for gang love.<br /><br />Please give address for live streaming and I am sure some SR users will btc donate to An Hero cause such as this!

				Assuming that the OP is not a troll, no, don&#039;t join a gang and here is why.<br /><br />The reality of gang membership for the vast majority of members (I am speaking of 99% here) never really make any money, are still dependent on government welfare, and go to jail for stuff that makes them less money that they would working as a burger flipper.<br /><br />When you get busted, the gangs won&#039;t hire a lawyer for you. You end up with the public defender, then you end up in jail.<br /><br />You are on SR now. What would you want to join a gang for? There are plenty of suppliers here. If you work hard (actually, not even that hard) you could be making the kind of money gang members dream of.

				I&#039;ve always wanted to be a gang member, like italian mafia or something, moving kilos of coke and mdma.<br />Or being their cook, working underground making crazy mind bending drugs.<br />I&#039;d carry a gold berretta and drive around in an old italian car. Being in a gang would be cool.<br />I&#039;m italian, wish i had some mafia family but sadly no...no gang for me. No free drugs... :&#039;(
