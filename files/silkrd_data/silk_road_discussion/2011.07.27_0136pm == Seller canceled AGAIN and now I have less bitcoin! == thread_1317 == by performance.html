				What the fuck is going on here? I am getting sick and tired of sellers canceling my God damn fucking orders! Enough is enough, I am getting pissed as fuck. And the worst part is that now I have FEWER bitcoins than I did when I started. Look:<br /><br />refund&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transaction #11707&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿8.76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿24.51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 27, 2011, 8:28 am UTC<br />purchase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transaction #11707&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿-9.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿15.75&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 27, 2011, 4:21 am UTC<br />refund&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transaction #11405&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿16.88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿24.88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 26, 2011, 3:49 am UTC<br /><br />So I start with ฿24.88, put in an order, bastard cancels the order, and now I have ฿24.51 ? How on earth can this be correct?<br /><br />The buyer should have an option of charging the seller 2% of the canceled order. If the seller communicated with the buyer and it was a legit cancel, then the buyer can waive the fee. But if its just a random cancel out of the blue with nothing more than &quot;sorry bro I can&#039;t fill the order now&quot; then the buyer should be able to penalize the seller. Hopefully this will dis-incentivize all this mother fucking CANCELING that keeps happening.<br /><br />And what the fuck is up with the hedging? Is this how it is supposed to work? My intuition tells me NO....if a seller cancels then the bitcoins should be returned.<br /><br />Let me point out that at the time I placed the order, bitcoins were worth a little over $14. And at the time of cancel they are worth less than $14. So at the end of the day, this &quot;non-transaction&quot; a.k.a. CANCELED order cost me money for NOTHING.<br /><br />Thank you for listening.<br /><br />

				Now you KNOW you&#039;re in a community run forum when the MOD can bitch about the way the site is run! :)<br /><br />I know there&#039;s sometimes problems here, but they seem very small compared to all the selection of products and benefits.<br /><br />Of course, anyone who doesn&#039;t like it can go to that *other* drug forum with escrow and a resolution center and BTC hedging...

				I&#039;m really confused here.<br /><br />Why did performance lose Bitcoin?&nbsp; Was it the Silk Road transaction fee?&nbsp; Or because it&#039;s pegged to the dollar?&nbsp; <br /><br />Neither one seems fair.&nbsp; If the sale got cancelled, I don&#039;t understand why he didn&#039;t get the exact amount of Bitcoin back that was withdrawn.&nbsp; Can someone dumb this down and explain it for me?

I think the buyer&#039;s guide makes it clear that hedging works for refunds as well. <br /><br />Why does it work this way? If the transaction is hedged for the seller, it must also be hedged for the buyer because otherwise people could scam SR by making fake sales to themselves and choosing to either finalize or cancel depending on what the value of the bitcoin does.
