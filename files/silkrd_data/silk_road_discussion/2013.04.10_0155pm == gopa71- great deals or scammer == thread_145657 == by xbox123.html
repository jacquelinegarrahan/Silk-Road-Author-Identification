				I&#039;m going to be honest, this profile resembles two previous profiles that I added to my favorites, both asking to FE, and ended up being the scam of the year!<br /><br />I got burned on attractive prices once last month, that would have turned my entire business around. Instead I got what I deserved for being greedy and FEing.<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting.<br /><br />My thing is, if you are doing domestic to domestic, there is no reason on God&#039;s green earth to finalize early. If you can&#039;t wait three days for your money as a vendor, I call shady all day. Sh!t&#039;s ridiculous in my opinion!

				Dude is running multiple accounts and placing &quot;orders&quot; then finalizing early to leave fake feedback <br /><br />Most of his big listings have feedback (which is sus as fuck) and they&#039;re, for the most part, all 6 and 7 days ago. Very generic and forcibly propagandizing the term &quot;trusted seller&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				I wish this info was out a day sooner, I lost about 1300$ to this piece of shit! I have been selling here for months, but this was my first SR purchase with a new buyer account, they had lots of good feedback so I trusted it. Makes me wish I just stuck to selling and spent my coin elsewhere! I have been asked to FE by 3 sellers now, I did it for gopa because they had feedback to back it, and no one was talking on the forums at the time, so I figured it was all good.... FML! First the BTC crash with tons of orders in escrow and plenty of BTC saved, then scammed on my first purchase for a large sum of money! I thought the scammers were on BMR why have I never had a problem there and only here? FUCK! As if it wasn&#039;t a shitty enough week already! And I really needed that purchase to come through! I won&#039;t be able to continue business pretty soon because of this fucked situation, no cash + no stamps = no orders shipped
