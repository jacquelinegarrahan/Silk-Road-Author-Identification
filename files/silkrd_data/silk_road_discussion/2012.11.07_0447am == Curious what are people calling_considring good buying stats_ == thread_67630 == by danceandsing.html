				For the longest time I had PERFECT buying stats and honestly took some pride in it. Always tried to treat people fair and with respect. Just until recently I had 44 transactions and NO refunds. Sucks that just recently I have my first problem and now my stats look like this:<br /><br />Total transactions: 49<br />Total spent: ฿462.93<br />Refund rate: 2.95%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0.76%<br />Member for: 8 months<br /><br />what are peoples thoughts on mine and what are vendors considering good or GREAT stats?<br /><br />Thanks!

				They&#039;re great stats. Don&#039;t be dramatic about not having perfect stats, one of the most annoying things I see on the forums. Some vendor fucking up is bound to happen eventually.

				auto-finalization... whats up with that, was it for an order you were waiting on or one that arrived?<br /><br />buyers should try really hard not to have an A-F on their accts because really its not that hard... vendors are using this is as an excuse to force everyone to FE, which i dont necessarily agree with. however they should never have to wait for the system to pay them either if the order arrived and the buyer failed to release escrow. the buyers need to remember how important this is for everyone

				Good point micro.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only let it AF once, and that was because some shit was happening with the feds and I at the time. Didn&#039;t want to even think of SR when that was going on.

				We&#039;ll look at all the numbers, but the only one that will get a message from us before we fill an order is the refund rate.&nbsp; While a number of vendors are concerned about getting their money soon enough so they can order more product, they should be more concerned about a skittish buyer with a higher refund rate.&nbsp; There can be a lot more issues with someone who has had issues in the past with refunds,&nbsp; their not above causing issues, can tend to be more picky, &amp; it will more than likely end up taking longer that a auto-finalized transaction with less $ &amp; more time.<br /><br />NCK

				Smaller orders and the stats won&#039;t bother me too much, larger orders and I start to get a little &#039;noid.&nbsp; If you have auto-finalization on your history, walk on by.&nbsp; If you have a high percentage of returns (10%+ type of shit), walk on by.<br /><br />But like I said, on smaller orders weird stats don&#039;t bug me as much.&nbsp; When I do list larger quantities I always let people know in the listing...&#039;have decent buyer stats before ordering this or it gets cancelled&#039;.&nbsp; Decent buyer stats is probably different for every vendor.

				I can&#039;t access to get my stats but they are something like this<br /><br />Total transactions: 30<br />Total spent: $2,500<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 3 months<br /><br />I was baffled and a little amused when I had a vendor tell me a few days ago that my stats were not acceptable.&nbsp; I thought to myself, &quot;How many people who place orders with you have stats that meet your requirements Oh Great One?&quot;&nbsp; I think he was just being pissy because I accisentally selected free shipping for the single item.&nbsp; It was an honest mistake, and I would have apologized for it if he had just pointyed it out without being a dick about it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even mind that he cancelled the order, but he was a total ass about it.&nbsp; I had noticed that he only wanted people with stats of&nbsp; 45 purchases and over $5,000 spent and 6 months, but I thought I was close enough, and that the requirements were probably for bulk only.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not a problem, I would rather order from someone who doesn&#039;t treat customers like untouchables anyways.&nbsp; Just was amazed that the vendor wanted those types of stats or FE from all customers.&nbsp; :o
