				So sick of this escrow system now, when over 12 of my crystal meth orders have been received this weekend, and only 3 people actually bother to finalize and review..it&#039;s really annoying waiting on buyers to get their shit together so I can receive my money.<br /><br />It really bugs me that legit sellers are always at the mercy of buyers such as F104..and TheHemi who even had the audacity to go on my METH THREAD AND DEMAND FAST SHIPPING....ITS WEDNESDAY NOW, and I have proof most of you (F104/theHemi, etc)&nbsp; received my product on saturday and have a problem or something finalizing the damn order.<br /><br />I sent over 6 messages to YOU F104 and I see you read them but you cant hit FINALIZE?<br /><br />Do you really think you are gaining something by not releasing my funds?<br /><br />What else can us as sellers do, besides waiting 18 DAYS to get some petty money back from an order we FRONTED to an unknown buyer....<br /><br />This system needs serious work, because buyers such as F104 makes it extremely frustrating to do business.<br /><br />It MAKAES NO SENSE HE CANNOT EVEN FINALIZE MY ORDER WHEN I SEE HE READS MY MESSAGES.<br /><br />F104....WTF?!!!!!!!!

				Well, &quot;Auto-finalize rate:&quot; is now a part of a buyer&#039;s Recent purchasing statistics.&nbsp; I know it doesn&#039;t help much now, but in the future you can look over these stats and avoid those buyers who regularly wait &#039;till the Auto-Finalize option kicks in.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had this happen to me several times and it&#039;s very annoying, to say the least.. I think SR should shorten the time to auto finalize if its USA to USA shipping.. Once the &quot;shipped&quot; button is pressed, I don&#039;t think that it should take more than 10 days (even 7) to auto finalize. On average, with first class mail, it takes 2-4 days with the average being 3. Granted, overseas is another issue, but within the USA i think the auto finalize should be shorten dramatically...<br /><br />Granted still keep up the 4 days for the seller to ship it&nbsp; but once that shipped button is pressed is when the shipping time should start... 7 days really is long enough. So, split the difference and make it 9. Honestly, has anyone ever sent a letter from coast to coast and had it take longer than 9 days? Since being here on SR, I would say that the longest time was 6 or 7 and that was due to weather, etc delays.. Or if its sent priority, It never takes more than 3 days..

				chronic pain is right, .us to .us should auto finalize quickly. Once I received my first order from silk road i was so excited to get to my computer and finalize and review the product.&nbsp; Fuck those people. i would prefer to error on the side of the vendor, if it arrives then the vendor can refund.&nbsp; there are far more customers who will receive the product and not finalize or get a refund then not say the product comes at a later date

				I agree as long as it didn&#039;t interfere with the resolution process.<br /><br />There are holiday trips and some have to work for a living which can complicate the finalization timing a bit.<br />So can not wanting anyone looking over your shoulder while on SR and not being able to avoid it at times.<br /><br />But still, a shorter time should be doable.<br /><br />I want to stay on the good buyers list (and get that invite should the invite only site go up&nbsp; :) ) so I always finalize the moment I can.

				I recently had a buyer that I went out of my way for and went to the post office on Saturday to ship his stuff release funds after 17 days. BTCs had lost half their value in that time. He said he felt bad and sent me 1 lousy BTC for the difference. I probably lost at least 5 of current BTCs on the deal. I appreciate the sentiment but DAMN just log in and finalize that shit when it comes in. How hard is that?

				Why is Nomadbloodbath, a Silk Road representative, ordering buyers to finalize before the mandatory time? Nomadbloodbath has no idea if what the OP says is true or not and seems to be taking the OP&#039;s claims at face value without any input from the buyer. He also does not know if the buyer opened or tried the product yet. Does nomadbloodbath hold any authority to be acting like this towards buyers and ordering them around?<br /><br />As to why they are not auto-finalizing, all one has to do is read the OP&#039;s review thread. Obviously this is a lesson being taught. Instead of complaining, change your ways.<br /><br />Why complain about people not finalizing fast enough when you take your own sweet lethargic time between a customers order and shipping date ?<br /><br />You seem to have plenty of time to write messages, blast people for not finalizing fast enough, and lounge around here, but you cant ship an order within a day or three after the orders ?<br /><br />If you did that to me, and the other bullshit in your review thread, I would&#039;nt be jumping through hoops to finalize fast for you either.<br /><br />Treat people how you want to be treated.<br /><br />I find it very ironic and amusing that you take your own sweet time sending orders, abusing that 5 day period of time before orders can be canceled, but you take great exception when a buyer does the exact same thing in regard to finalizing.<br /><br />Quid Pro Quo<br /><br />karma can be a bitch too.

				^^^^^^^IN RESPONSE TO ABOVE POST:<br /><br />First of all who are you to question Nomad&#039;s authority or input, and mine?<br /><br />I take my sweet, lethargic time?<br />With what order? the F104 that I shipped out 2 days after he ordered due to a large amount of orders?<br />I never let shit become late on any of these orders.....So I don&#039;t know where you get off talking about karma, etc. when it&#039;s obvious I&#039;ve upped my rating and customer service ....so who are you&nbsp; the Simon Cowell of SR?<br /><br />NOMAD btw, odered on a Friday and he got his stuff tuesday..woulda been monday but it was LABOR DAY..or do you not recognize labor day you un-american commie&nbsp; :o<br />How much faster can that be? He ordered from me as well as others and my service has been 5/5, so I dont &quot;deserve&quot; to wait on funds for product already that made it.<br /><br />How could it have been pinched and they in trouble, when they both have been reading my msgs...?<br />Wouldnt they not have at least mentioned that SATURDAY they got pinched....which is not the case here....<br /><br /><br />TRY AGAIN..<br /><br /><br />LMAO

				who am I? - a seller and a buyer with an opinion. Nomad is ordering buyers to finalize. That isnt the way the system is supposed to work. They finalize when they feel satisfied with their order and if you were a good businessman, they WOULD be finalizing.

				I think everyone knows the old adage &quot;don&#039;t bite off your nose to spite your face&quot;.&nbsp; Well, a lot of that is happening in threads that progress the way this one has.&nbsp; I want everyone, if they can, to step back a minute and think of what the last 15 days have been like:<br /><br />1. last week the BTC dumped from 10.50 to 8.50 about 30% so most sellers lost 30% on all their BTC&#039;s that were in escrow at that time.<br /><br />2. yesterday the BTC dumped again from 8.50 to 6.50 about another 30% and those same sellers lost 30% on the BTC&#039;s they had in escrow again.<br /><br />3. A marketplace needs both buyers and sellers, but if there is nothing good offered for sale, there is no need for buyers, good or bad.<br /><br />4. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, around here would like to see the SR listing prices reduced to the best street prices.&nbsp; Am I wrong?&nbsp; Anyone not want that?&nbsp; Well, the way to get that is to make an environment and perform behaviors where sellers can make profits at street prices, then they will become a reality.<br /><br />5. As a buyer, I finalize when I receive and inspect the shipment.&nbsp; I DON&#039;T wait until I try it.&nbsp; If it&#039;s fake or lousy then I can come to the Forum if the seller refuses to deal with me about a quality issue.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t believe a seller should have to wait for his payment until a buyer decides it&#039;s time to get high.&nbsp; That&#039;s just not kosher and I think all reasonable minds would agree about that.<br /><br />6. I haven&#039;t followed VortexMilkMan&#039;s thread but I understand he was slow to ship for some period when he was getting started.&nbsp; Punishing him now with slow finalizations DOES NOT a better marketplace make.&nbsp; We each individually should treat the other as we would LIKE to be treated, not necessarily how we were treated and if we all do that, pretty soon only those who are good sellers will be getting orders from those who are good buyers.&nbsp; Taking revenge in the form of slow payemnt just perpetuates bad practices and bad attitudes...and no one wants that to be the norm at SR, do they?&nbsp; <br /><br />7. I want SR to be one forum, open to all, totally transparent (to the degree it doesn&#039;t help inform LE) and I know that is also SR&#039;s own desire.&nbsp; Anything that is exclusionary will sooner or later also exclude YOU, and at that point, YOU won&#039;t like it either.&nbsp; <br /><br />Be good to each other, have a great time getting high on super quality products.&nbsp; Leave the other stuff to Topix and that Overseas Pharmacy place where the middle-aged women with 6 cats each bitch about how they sent their WU payment at 12:50pm and the supplier said the cutoff was 1pm but he still didn&#039;t ship.&nbsp; We all came here to escape that crap.&nbsp; Let&#039;s don&#039;t generate our own brand and flavor of it too.<br />p.s. I love you all :)

				This is definitely a pain in the ass.<br /><br />What&#039;s just as annoying is - I&#039;ve contacted the buyers TWICE to check in and see if they&#039;ve received...<br /><br />No response for days. Now I feel like I&#039;ll get stiffed for BTC that has halved in the last week.<br /><br />I ship my orders out within SIX hours and if more I&#039;ll tell the buyer. I agree with Chronicpain that the <br /><br />autofinalize should be shortened. I also agree with Joeblow - I finalize UPON RECEIPT. If it got there,<br /><br />in good time, and all looks well - release your god damn BTC. This isn&#039;t Try + Buy.<br /><br />If you have a problem with the product, speak to the seller, and if you&#039;re really not happy, EDIT BUTTON.<br /><br />In agreement with SRSA&#039;s comment, this goes hand in hand with treating people the way you want to be <br /><br />treated.

				I&#039;ve been a respectful buyer and I have the feeling that some other buyers have helped to drive some of my favorite vendors away.<br /><br />I would not mind at all if SR sellers had the ability to ban specific users from seeing their items or purchasing them.<br /><br />I don&#039;t sell on SR, but I sell items.&nbsp; I understand that it&#039;s a big fucking hassle to prepare and ship even 5 packages a day that don&#039;t require any special measures at all, and customers can be dramatic complainers.<br /><br />So, Silk Road, let&#039;s see you add this capability to sellers.&nbsp; Every time a vendor has to deal with some whiny asshole or dishonest dirtbag, that takes away from effort he can expend to service ME.&nbsp; Let the sellers ban a user after sending a message that makes it obvious this will be a problem customer, or ban a user if they buy and don&#039;t finalize.

				Oh man! NOT FINALIZING in a TIMELY MANNER IS WRONG!! I have 2 deadbeats now that won&#039;t finalize. No contact, no nothing. One won&#039;t even open the messages. I want to strangle them both!! Fu*king deadbeats! Very inconsiderate to say the least. It also makes me think that they may be LE. Not finalizing in a timely manner throws up red flags! Danger Danger Danger SR Vendor. I just don&#039;t know. I did my part. Thank goodness for escrow. <br /><br />&quot;Is that money for lattes?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ya, prolly&quot;

				This pisses me the most. &quot;Yeah I received my drugs.. fuck you seller and enjoy ur auto finalize.&quot;<br /><br />I always finalize &amp; feedback shortly after receiving. That&#039;s the fucking least you can do for your vendor.<br /><br />If price of an single hit posted was something like $28 which is nice profit---&gt; dropped to $18 which is like $5 profit after postage.. not so much, given that the seller has always the custom risk for himself buying bigger amounts.. and $5 profit from single hit + posting it is not that profitable, if you aren&#039;t selling much.<br />

				One of the buyers responded in another thread. Frankly, quite levelheaded and without any flaming. And there the story sounds all different again. I guess you should never judge without hearing both sides.<br /><br />Regardless though, when you get your shit, just finalize the thing. If the way the order was handled didn&#039;t please you, you always have the option to simply not buy from that vendor anymore - the ultimate of all self-regulating market forces.<br /><br />Retaliation games like uhm my shit wasn&#039;t there before that party I planned now enjoy auto-finalize isn&#039;t the answer either. Be better than that.....<br /><br />Mr. Wholesome&#039;s 0.002BTC....

I have PM&#039;d each person very nicely, and gotten no response.<br /><br />When a buyer and a vendor interact on SR, we both risk each other&#039;s asses equally if not more on the vendor&#039;s side.<br /><br />As both vendor and a buyer it&#039;s one hand washes the other on here, or piss off - seriously<br /><br />Why the fuck do people do this? We shouldn&#039;t even have to worry about &quot;buyer last seen&quot;...perhaps this would help?<br /><br /><br />L<br /><br />
