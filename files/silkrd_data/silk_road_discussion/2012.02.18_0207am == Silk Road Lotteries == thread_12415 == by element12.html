				Is anyone else skeptical of all these lottery listings on SR?<br /><br />It seems like it would be incredibly easy for the seller to create a puppet account, order the listing them self, and then fudge the number generated and make a couple hundred in the process.<br /><br />It&#039;s also giving vendors crazy amounts of 5/5 feedback from people finalizing early to buy the ticket.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would feel a lot better if the ratings did not go into the seller&#039;s feedback and if SR ran the lottery themselves (IE the site chooses rather than the vendor)

				Yeah, it is completely bogus way to pad feedbacks. RandomGuy1970 had like 350 FB&#039;s in 4 days, without a sale, while also having things to sell. ObamaGirl doing the same. I went for it at first, but then went and changed my FB to a 1. <br />Complete bullshit to get their rank up to top 20 in a matter of days. I think all the &quot;lottery&quot; feedbacks should be abolished.

				I look at it like this, I&#039;m not personally going to participate in&nbsp; lottery unless its either A)Free or B) from an already established and trusted seller; I&#039;m also not going to buy for example, Randomguy&#039;s bud (no offense RandomGuy) until I see a satisfactory history of completed transactions and reviews and completed orders, so all this in mind the lottery system works mostly for us informed customers, we get free lotteries from time to time as people boost their Feedback and we don&#039;t get screwed because we stay informed and make only smart purchases<br /><br />It&#039;s not a perfect system but it works mostly in our favor and doesn&#039;t screw up other people with &quot;free&quot; listings like moneypak exchangers etc<br /><br />the only good fix I could think of might be a &quot;lottery listing&quot; option for vendors where SR chooses the winner randomly at the closing and feedback is condensed so for every 20/50/100 reviews you get 1 averaged out score added<br />; or a more heavily weighted system based on item price<br /><br />Also giving someone a 1/5 is a little rude for a free lottery; even if he is just FB harvesting, just don&#039;t participate, no use in purposefully messing up the FB of someone who might actually be holding an honest lottery, it&#039;s kinda our fault everyone wants a piece, or SR&#039;s for the system as it is, not his
