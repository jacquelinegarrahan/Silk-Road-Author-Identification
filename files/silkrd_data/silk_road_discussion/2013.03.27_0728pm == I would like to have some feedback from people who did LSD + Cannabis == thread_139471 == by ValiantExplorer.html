				I had an extremely powerful trip on LSD and Cannabis. I vaporized a medium quantity of Cannabis about 4 hours AFTER I took the LSD. The result was incredible to say the least. It was the best trip I had in my life.<br /><br />I knew that Cannabis can supposedly prolong the LSD high but this was different. It didn&#039;t prolong it. It enhanced it. Exponentially.<br /><br />Am eager to know more about this.<br /><br />Thank you in advance :).

				Yeah, it happens.<br />I&#039;m pretty chronic though, so MJ only has a little effect on me, regardless of what else I&#039;m on.<br />I had a nice uplifting trip last weekend and towards the end I smoked a joint (my personal joints are .5 to .8 of a gram) and I had some decent euphoria for a good 1/2 hour afterwards.&nbsp; It felt like I was back in mid-trip again.

				I can not tell much as i only had one lsd trip yet. But i always smoke a joint on the comeup of any drug but alcohol (even alcohol sometimes but i ALWAYS regret it - besides i didnt drink alcohol for a long time now and i dont plan to do it again any time soon). But indeed i had a wonderful trip back then :). Just like ProudCannabian im a daily smoker for a long time and it doesnt has that much of an effect for me too. So im probably the wrong person to talk about that :D<br /><br />All the best

				Can anyone here recommend a good US vendor of LSD?&nbsp; I am having great trouble finding it at all in smaller quantities on the road.

				Cannabis is fairly well known for doing this with LSD from everything I have read, plenty of experience with it as well. On one not too intense trip I smoked a joint and almost immediately started to hallucinate heavily just looking at the smoke.

				yep, cannabis most certainly enhances the psychedelic experience! also good for those prone to anxiety during trips... assuming cannabis doesn&#039;t make you anxious to begin with, of course.

				Shrooms and cannabis are certainly a natural pair. I&#039;ve vaped mj on LSD on several occasions and haven&#039;t been experimental enough to notice this effect - I also vape from the start, so later in the trip is certainly something I could try. Will report back.

				It was wonderful and very warming to me. It always seems to enhance any psychedelic as said above with mushrooms too. I also find that I actually smoke more when I&#039;m tripping than when I&#039;m not these days for some reason.

				i&#039;ve only tripped a couple times when i&#039;ve NOT had weed and smoked after the peak. it always brings you straight back and more intense with visuals. first time i did shrooms i was told by a guy in one of those smartshops in nl that it&#039;d weaken the trip not enhance it but i got into bed after a trip and a smoke and felt like the sheets were dragging me down through space or something. it&#039;s awesome. same with acid but not quite as intense as with shrooms. if you smoke too soon it dulls the trip a bit though. completely unrelated but don&#039;t mix with mxe that&#039;s pure hell.

				Thank you for your replies people. Very interesting to read similar experiences.<br /><br />Ron Swanson: what is MXE?<br /><br />I guess I am lucky because I don&#039;t use these substances very often. Even cannabis, I smoke less than once per week. So, I am probably not developing tolerance.

				mxe is a dissociative kinda like a more mellow but longer lasting ketamine. spent about 5 hours curled up in bed watching familiar sitcoms with the craziest visuals to try and distract from the worst trip i&#039;ve ever experienced. lucky i didn&#039;t kill myself honestly. i&#039;ll always have some benzos on hand for future trips just incase it goes bad...

				Smoking pot and tripping are inseparable in my opinion. It is one pairing I will never go without. Any time I tripped without some nug to ease the shock my trips were... not mellow. I won&#039;t even consider doses now without a substantial supply of pot to ease my mind into the mellowness.
