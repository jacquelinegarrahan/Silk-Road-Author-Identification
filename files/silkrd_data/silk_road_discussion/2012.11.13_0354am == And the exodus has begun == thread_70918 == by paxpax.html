				The vendor ranks at BMR has been surging since SR went dark, if DPR doesn&#039;t get the site back up soon there might not be much of an SR to return to. Personally I am comfortable using either site. Lets be honest, it&#039;s the vendors that have made SR. If those vendors jump ship to a new site I imagine the rest would follow.&nbsp;

				If the new site offers a userbase, availability of goods, structure, and reliability(i&#039;m not implying that SR is good for any of these things, I&#039;m just saying that a value for the variable exists) of similar or better nature to that of SR, it makes sense that it would be preferrential.&nbsp; At the moment, SR has no &#039;availability of goods&#039; so if someone wants to get goods, SR isn&#039;t the place to be, but given the promise of future availability(i.e. the sales section getting fixed) people are weighing the consequences of one action vs another. If they decide that a course of action taking them away from SR has a better end result than a course of action keeping them here, obviously they will move away...

				BMR sucks, i suppose in the unlikely event that this is the end of the road, then it will have to due...and i also have seen an influx of vendors on BMR from SR. somthing about BMR just rubs me the wrong way, not to mention the lack of phycadelics, and the insane prices of the bit that is there.<br />&nbsp;I sincerely hope that DPR and who ever else gets the show back on the road. I would absolutly hate to see somthing to wonderful go to shit.

				This is simple supply and demand:<br /><br />SR cannot supply, there is a lot of demand, the demand goes to the supply, currently BMR is the supply.<br /><br />Economics 101, once SR is back up, it&#039;ll be the king again.

				I&#039;m going to be using BMR with a vendor I regularly use from SR. Not so sure I can trust the road right now. I&#039;ll wait a while to make sure the shit hasn&#039;t hit the fan, and it converted to a honeypot or something equally as sinister before I come back. If business is good over there and vendors use it more often, and SR is still running as it was before, I&#039;ll probably end up using both. <br /><br />Better to be overly cautious and paranoid in a situation like this, than it is to end up in prison.

				Well the Silk Road already has all it&#039;s shit figured out. BMR is starting to get a grip on it, but SR has had a lot longer to perfect it. Also, the sign-up and transaction cycle for BMR I presume is longer than SR will be down for. <br /><br />Still, the rise of BMR could be a good thing. Contest SR&#039;s monopoly(not saying SR hasn&#039;t been good about it though), and it could be an established escrow that allows information and weapon sales

				What security? SR can&#039;t protect you anymore then bmr. Both are hidden services, both use escrow, both use a peer review system. In fact there is likely more le at Sr then bmr due to Sr large user base and media attention. <br />What other steps does Sr take to keep you safe? You&#039;re security is up to you. Pgp, research and good funding practices are the best you can do.&nbsp; SR security is intended to keep Sr safe not you. <br />

				I would steer well clear of BMR. <br /><br />&nbsp;To add to what everyone else has been saying, it seems that a few of the vendors that jumped ship here in bad form, i.e. SuperTrips and MrFireUK have set up shop in BMR. <br /><br />Be careful if you simply cannot wait for SR to come back on.

				I honestly think the site has potential. Sure, now it&#039;s lot&#039;s of scammers, but it&#039;s the closest thing SR has to competition. Maybe when the administration there figures it&#039;s shit out and makes it so the decent listings there arent surrounded by scams, it could be a legitimate source of items SR won&#039;t offer, a backup market for when the silk road is down, or simply just a place that serves as an alternative to SR

				A great vendor from SR set up shop at BMR for the time being.<br /><br />That tells me two things:<br /><br />1. Dude is a money maker, eager, and his/her reviews on SR are second to none.<br />2. I&#039;m getting high in a few days.<br /><br />They have an escrow... but the PGP is automatic, so send your addy (PGP) via tormail and all will be well.<br /><br />At this point I trust the vendor... and I trust BMR to facilitate the transaction. Smart vendors in the business of making money will do the same.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				The stupidity some of you possess is astounding.<br /><br />1. SR is down<br />2. BMR has an escrow system<br />3. Some people cannot wait so they buy on BMR <br /><br /><br />The prices are high on BMR because there is NO COMPETITION.<br />If more people offer a product, the prices plummet (with some exceptions, opiates)<br /><br />If you do not like BMR, don&#039;t shop there.<br />If you do not like BMR, do not hinder anyone from exercising their choice to shop there<br /><br />Be good citizens of the Tor community and be respectful.

				I&#039;m honestly thinking about buying one of the listings that would violate SRs terms of use. Now I&#039;d feel comfortable buying from one of the 25+ feedback vendors, but I&#039;m one the fence if id do it for a 10+ feedback member

				@ grapepen, do some reading check around , for actual experiences with BMR, then take a gander at their site, if you can not conclude that they are absolutely inferior then you have eye problems. no disrespect intended here, i just believe in patronage.<br />&nbsp;@GiveUsSome. the loyalty comes from seeing and understanding the utter time,care and straight genius that goes into SR, and if the road went down and all the vendors moved along to BMR then im sure that it would not be half the place it is right now. The validity of the vendors is most of my, and other peoples issue with BMR, then theres the lack of structure and security&nbsp; to boot.

				the king is not dead..<br /><br />this place has taught me 2 very important things.. <br /><br />1 ~ Patience is a virtue. From Learning pgp, to installing and keeping my shit rock secure and stealth, to dealing with online vendors, learning how to get scammed and what it feels like to finding the good guys and funneling as much money to those guys as i possibly can so they are happy and i am happy. A little extra coin to your vendor is always a good sign.. Hell u pay extra to keep your car in front at the club or where ever u go same goes here.<br /><br />2 ~ A luxury once tasted becomes a necessity! Yes this is a very very large luxury to sit and just order from here send some coins and wait until it gets here. ALSO the quality i have found here on the road.. well i am still here and after all if it was not good people would not flock.. <br /><br />So all this being said look at the down time to make sure all your sit is in place all your stuff is locks and nothing is floating about. Have you gotten lax in your deliveries or location. Is there a better way to do what u are doing upgrade or just change it up. Change is always good. Have u written your top go to vendors and see how they are doing with all their coin tied up??? Do they need a little extra in the time of need.&nbsp; So for me...<br /><br />Road has a sink hole that has the construction crew fixing we hope. AS wiht everything it talkes 2 times as long and costs 4 times as much. PLUS how the hell do u test a system like they must have in place.. Ok get 10,000 of your closest friends to hit the site at once.. Ok i think u see.. <br />what other site??? There is another site?? There is no other site...... There is only this...&nbsp; here....... and now <br /><br />DPR For........<br /><br /><br />GOD!&nbsp; <br /><br />time to put the meth down and get to work...

				Like a few others, I tried BMR a while ago. I did NOT like how they autoencrypt everything either. I am not sure how it works, but I assume the vendor has to supply a gpg and that is how it is done? If that is the case, than they have your public key on file,&nbsp; i dont think that is too smart, though it does assure you get a gpg signed message rather than someone sending you it all open or with privnote.<br /><br />I just had a bad feeling joining and browsing BMR, i deleted my account after a few weeks of lurking, just did not seem legit, and scam galore! <br /><br />If you do find YOUR vendor on there, than I would ask MANY questions they may only know from private conversations you had during your build up of rapport. I still say, stay off BMR, IMO, but everyone is entitled to their choices.<br /><br />I will admit, I would go back to BMR, only if SR was gone forever (DOUBTFUL), and it someone was confirmed BMR was 100% legit, and even maybe REFORMED their policies they currently have in place.

				Seems we have a mod/spam buster in the thread. Thanks for that.<br /><br />As for the topic, a couple vendors doing business over there (in addition to here when it comes back online) is hardly an exodus. Expect a bigger shift if the Road is down for at least another week or two.

				As an actual vendor on BMR, let me chime in.<br /><br />As I see it, BMR is less likely to be a honeypot than SR. You won&#039;t find a gun or weapon on SR, you can (though I&#039;d recommend against anyone trying) find one on bmr. The admin is backopy and he does a solid job. They do get too many scam listings, but if you&#039;re not completely naive you can spot them a mile away. This is due to the fact that bmr does not charge a vendor&#039;s fee. Any asshole can list a fake or joke listing and hope some sucker buys it. That&#039;s why they have a feedback system, same as SR. Don&#039;t buy from someone with 0 feedback. Any asshole can list a fake listing here too, it just costs $150 or whatever to get that vendor account. The trust is lower there, which is a GOOD thing (some of you over here boggle my mind the way you trust DPR and sr. I&#039;d like to see you walk into the projects in red hook and and try and cop the way you trust people in here...). On BMR, PGP encryption is automatic on in-system messages to vendors (yes, we supply our public keys. No, supplying a PGP public key is not a security threat, whichever dumbass said that.) There&#039;s never been a Tony76. Stay in escrow and go by feedback and everything will work out just fine.<br /><br />The biggest problem with bmr is the lack of sales volume. I use SR far more because I get far more sales here. BMR charges lower commissions by about half. That being said, most of the vendors will head over there in a heartbeat. Loyalty? Don&#039;t be childish. This is capitalism. We go where the money is.<br /><br />

				Yes, recently bmr also started to charge for seller accounts. Level 2 means a seller that can list under drugs, weapons, chemicals and so on, can only be a seller and has to have a pgp key, level 1 means a seller that can only list at &quot;lesser&quot; categories and may or may not use pgp and can be both, seller and customer.

				I love SR so as long as it is there and used by the people it is now then I will continue to use them. I do have some loyalty to SR, I think it is so good but Ive never used any other sites.<br /><br />The black market vendor is right about it is the vendors that make SR the way it is, if all the vendors went to another site the buyers would use that just the same and we can still get on DPR was right in his statement that even if SR was to eventually go down the geenie is out of the bottle and the people can organise things themselves.<br /><br />I will start checking out other places and see what the options are but I&#039;ll be straight on to SR as soon as it is running again, if it is.

				In response to questioning whether a vendor on BMR is the same as a vendor on SR.<br /><br />You should be using PGP for everything. Check the vendors BMR key with their SR key. If they&#039;re the same, you&#039;re good.<br />Obviously this only works if you have a copy of their key already, but you should if you&#039;ve done business with them in the past.<br /><br />It&#039;d be nice if you helped validate the vendor on BMR as well. I&#039;m sure they&#039;d appreciate it.

				By far the biggest problem with BMR is that they have a less extensive forum which makes it harder to verify a vendors reputation.<br /><br />The greatest strength SR has is this forum and the work done on here by members (i.e. : Avengers LSD) to verify quality and reputation. Especially since there is a somewhat reliable &quot;karma&quot; system here.<br />

				I&#039;ll admit I checked out BMR under a completely different name.&nbsp; Something about it feels like a cheap rip-off of SR. Most listings were in Europe, and the US ones didn&#039;t have feedback, and the feedback looked fake.&nbsp; I know people fake feedback on SR, but on BMR it is bloody obvious.&nbsp; Some of the vendors on there creep me out, too.&nbsp; Even in my darkest hour, SR was there for me, I have never been burned on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll just wait till it comes back up, I&#039;m not screwing with BMR, especially if they.&nbsp; Godspeed, DPR!

Any asshole can list a fake listing here too, it just costs $150 or whatever to get that vendor account. The trust is lower there, which is a GOOD thing (some of you over here boggle my mind the way you trust DPR and sr. I&#039;d like to see you walk into the projects in red hook and and try and cop the way you trust people in here...). On BMR, PGP encryption is automatic on in-system messages to vendors (yes, we supply our public keys. No, supplying a PGP public key is not a security threat, whichever dumbass said that.) There&#039;s never been a Tony76. Stay in escrow and go by feedback and everything will work out just fine.<br /><br />The biggest problem with bmr is the lack of sales volume. I use SR far more because I get far more sales here. BMR charges lower commissions by about half. That being said, most of the vendors will head over there in a heartbeat. Loyalty? Don&#039;t be childish. This is capitalism. We go where the money is.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The automatic PGP encryption IS a security risk. It means users rely on the site to encrypt the data and if it were a honey pot or ever compromised then all the addresses could be intercepted in plain text before converted to pgp. I see this as a major security issue and much worse than plain text because people will feel comforted by the fact that its pgp when it could be just as insecure as plain text.<br /><br />I have checked out BMR as an alternative to selling on SR (I love SR but this is a business and if BMR was quality site I&#039;d happily expand my business to both sites) I am very dissapointed by BMRs ease of use. It may be fine for a few sales a day but as soon as you&#039;d get into large quantity it will become very tedious to use. There are a lot of fixes that need to be made on BMR before I&#039;d consider selling on there :(

				BMR is sketchier because you&#039;re used to SR.<br /><br />You guys are missing a crucial point.<br /><br />With SR down, BMR is the ONLY place you are going to go and buy with full escrow/community protection for many items.

Sure you could encrypt with pgp before sending to BMR and have it encrypted by the user and BMR but I doubt many uses would do this because in their mine it would be &quot;why bother, bmr is already doing the pgp for me&quot;<br /><br />As far as I understand the entire reason to use PGP on a site like SR is to protect against info being leaked in the event of a honey pot or site being compromised and if the PGP is being done server side instead of with the user this extra layer of safety does nothing at all but does provide a false sense of security which in my opinion is more dangerous than no PGP at all.

You&#039;re insane if you think the same doesn&#039;t apply to SR. This is a business my friend, these misplaced loyalties will get you jammed up. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but by any analysis SR is considerably more likely to be a honeypot, especially after they suspiciously closed the Armory with no legitimate explanation right around the time Fast and Furious was having congressional hearings. As I see it, the sale of weapons, poisons, biological agents on bmr, while perhaps morally repugnant, is a fair indication they are not being run by any law enforcement organizations (yet). The same I cannot say for SR. Wake up.<br /><br />That being said. Due to the nature of tor hidden services that we all love so much, even a honeypot can be used safely if you&#039;re smart. PGP being paramount. (Now how do we get the 50% of customers sending clear-text shipping info to start pgp-encrypting?)

The people I saw still gave up PGP keys, so you can still use &quot;your&quot; PGP all the way through. <br /><br />SR was, and hopefully remains to be, absolutely light years ahead of everything else out there. But, I don&#039;t think a single person didn&#039;t register and log in and go &quot;this is too good to be true,&quot; and then realizing it wasn&#039;t. Except maybe the longtime darknet vendors - they may have had that moment a long time ago. <br /><br />Everybody just needs to maybe put down the computer for a few days, come back, and see what&#039;s up. If god forbid you have use your PGP Keyring contact list (wait, you don&#039;t have one? Well, everybody said to get it.....) or BMR to reopen a few lines of communication, that&#039;s not that bad at all.<br /><br />Has anyone here ever had the total free selection of the items that appear on SR? At the level of ease you can buy them with? I doubt 4-ACO-DMT is something I could ask around for on a whim and find pharm grade amounts of it. <br /><br />SR should have always been approached with the mindset of &quot;this is fucking fantastic, so I should use it while I can.&quot; That implied end date could be anything, but - everybody knocking BMR or talking shit back and forth accomplishes nothing, and I hope people things in to perspective - a lot of us seem to forget how easily SR brought the world in to our lives without getting off the couch.

				How would that work anyways, does the DEA/FBI have any jurisdiction outside the US and do you think they would work with lets say Canadian law enforcement to arrest someone from SR?<br />Am I naive in thinking the feds dont care about a small time bud buyer from Canada? <br />

They know they&#039;re safer on SR than on BMR. BMR&#039;s admin is a fucking waste who spammed his shit all over these forums and the bitcointalk forums while, originally, allowing child-porn and everything else SR is against.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t trust BMR&#039;s security, personally.

Same/same<br /><br />Harvesting addresses with no drugs sent or received is a waste of time.&nbsp; Nothing gained, nothing ventured.<br /><br />Actually sending drugs thru the mail?&nbsp; Again, why? AT BEST, they snag a few small time users before word gets out.&nbsp; Reverse sting won&#039;t work, either.&nbsp; They can&#039;t leverage the buyer, or otherwise work their way up the chain.&nbsp; And at worst?&nbsp; Teenage Johnny and five of his friends overdose and die getting fucked up on Federal Heroin.&nbsp; So they&#039;d HAVE to deliver it in person.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; More manpower, police work.&nbsp; More expenditure.&nbsp; More money.<br /><br />LE on all levels have evolved into self-serving entities of local, state, and federal authority...&nbsp; Ever-increasing budgets (yet still ALWAYS under-funded), asset forfeiture in rem, and increasing authority over deceasing civil liberties and rights, however: Selling and mailing drugs thru the mail is a completely different animal than setting up a controlled buy in person, where the rewards easily outweigh the money spent and man-hours invested..<br /><br />Besides, only at the Federal level would jurisdictional authority exist for such an endeavor.&nbsp; The manpower and expenditure that would be required, combined with the necessary degree of coordination between federal and state authority (and additional expense) precludes any possibility that the fat, bloated sow we call Federal Government will ever lift her head from the trough long enough to feed on SR/BMR slop...&nbsp; Even at the behest of the good Senators Schumer and Manchin.<br /><br />Unless she can somehow get to that Dreaded Pirate Roberts guy, and his buried btc treasure...&nbsp; Now, THAT feeding might be worth some federal funding.<br /><br />All colorful sarcasm aside, though- I think users of both sites are quite safe, as long as they don&#039;t act downright downright careless or foolhardy.

				What&#039;s the problem?<br />Just buy from vendors offering 100% escrow and you&#039;re as fine as here.<br /><br />I agree that there seem to be much more scammers there than here, at least compared to the user-base,<br />but those are alrgely in the weapons area (99% of those offering whole guns are scammers, most you can easily identify using google inverse picture search) and the financial things, mostly the bank-accounts. Who, in his right mind, would sell you a bank-account with FULL ACCESS, cards, TANs (you might check the bank and the account - yes, they are clever and will give you the account user and pw, for the way TANs work, for most Germanaccounts you need some piece of hardware, like, but not usually exactly, yubikeys).<br /><br />I mainly use BMR, but for drugs, I&#039;d always prefer SR, or some private deal with individuals I know from previous deals.<br /><br /><br />
