				Hey i&#039;m new to this whole thing and i want to establish a good buyer feedback. How can I do so? send money first and finalize early?

				Read all the major sections of the Silk Road Wiki: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />Finalizing early means ordering product from a vendor then releasing the funds from escrow before you have actually received the product at your door.<br />Use vendors with high ratings (the numbers next to their name)<br />Research the vendors beforehand on the forum and read the feedback left on their profile page<br />If you have a question, use the forum&#039;s search feature beforehand, you can also search vendors names/reviews with it and anything else<br />If you&#039;re going to be doing H and in the future know you&#039;ll be going through withdrawal make sure you have a vendor with good fucking shipping speeds and is domestic.

				I think the above posters have already given some great advice about where to start - trust me reading all those sections will provide you with a wealth of starting knowledge, from there it is going to come down to experience.<br /><br />As a new buyer it is obvious that the vendors will be apprehensive, after all having no stats and then starting to purchase medium to large orders will probably end up with some vendors to ask for FE or cancelling your order completely, therefore I would recommend sticking to small orders and building up a base of confidence and your buyer stats to boot, I also recommend messaging the vendor and introducing yourself as a first time buyer - to buying from him/her or buying in general to SR, I&#039;ve always found this a polite thing to do and will always help you get the best reaction.<br /><br />Anything from there will depend upon your personality and the path you decide to take!<br /><br />Welcome to the Road and good luck :)<br /><br />makku<br />

				Use PGP when sending your address. I can&#039;t beleive how many people send their address plain text.<br /><br />Also, when you send your key make sure you send the _PUBLIC_ key, not the private key. Two people in the last 10 days have sent us their private keys.<br /><br />I also advise that you do not finalize early. We do not ask new users to finalize early for our LSD. When you finalize early you are at the mercy of the vendor.

				Always check your URL. there is lots of scamming going on. I have just had a successful outcome but it took a few mistakes expensive mistakes. SR is just fantastic for people like me that live a long way away from any metropolis. Stay domestic and small to begin with. Build a relationship with your vendor.

				Thanks alot guys... I think I did get scammed but for only 8 btc, ordered something from LUPEN before realizing people said he was no good, but now i&#039;ve learned. I didn&#039;t even use PGP but from now on that&#039;s all I&#039;m going to use to be on the safe side.

				Take a look at the vendors NorCal and RXking. Good vendors have active feedback, don&#039;t require you to FE, provide clear instructions, and have great communication. Send them a message before buying explaining that you are new and would like to make a purchase, as mentioned earlier. Read the vendor instructions they list and don&#039;t ask a stupid question that&#039;s covered in their instructions. Good vendors will answer legitimate questions but have little patience for lack of due diligence from a rookie. Use the forum search tool. I am fairly new and have a 100% delivery rate because of the vendors I choose to deal with. I see a lot of new people complaining about losses because they choose the wrong vendor.FE on time and have fun.

				1) STAY IN ESCROW<br />2) MAKE SOME SMALL PURCHASES ----&gt; THIS WILL RAISE YOUR STATS<br />3) ONCE YOUR STATS ARE HIGHER, VENDORS FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE DEALING WITH YOU AND MORE OBLIGED TO KEEP YOU IN ESCROW<br />4) YOU=HAPPY

				Generally new buyers have to finalize early [FE].&nbsp; This means the vendor gets paid before they ship.&nbsp; I require FE all the time for almost everyone, not just new people.&nbsp; Look long and hard at a seller&#039;s feedback before you buy from them.&nbsp; When you see a (100) next to a seller&#039;s name that is a pretty good indication that they are legit.&nbsp; Some good ones have (99).&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t go any lower than that generally or you start to get vendors who are not consistent.&nbsp; Read over their feedbacks and look for trends like bad products or bad stealth.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just look at the first page of feedbacks!!!!&nbsp; Go through a bunch of them.<br /><br />If you need anabolic steroids or diet pills or benzos please look at my profile.&nbsp; You will see a link in my signature below this post.&nbsp; Note also that you should read my (or any seller&#039;s) entire profile before you order.&nbsp; There is a damn good reason we go to the effort of writing all of that.&nbsp; We want to make sure that we are on the same page of music as our buyers.&nbsp; If there are misunderstandings then our feedback % is in jeopardy, and sellers who value their feedback over and above all else put a lot of time and effort into the profile page and lay down the terms exactly.&nbsp; We just want to avoid misunderstandings that lead to disgruntled customers.<br /><br />Most of all have fun!&nbsp; Silk Road should be a pleasure to use not a scary chore.&nbsp; Spend time on the forums here and learn all about the logistics of ordering, or just jump right in with a dealer who has a very high % and you will likely have a great experience here on the road.&nbsp; Best of luck!&nbsp;

It&#039;s a bit like a seatbelt or airbags in a car -- better to have it, and not need it, than need it and not have it. <br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />
