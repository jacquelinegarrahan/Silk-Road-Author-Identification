				Bitinstant works fine<br /><br />I just transfered 670 dollars with it 2 days ago. There seems to be a slight bug on the main site. To get around the bug, go to www.blockchain.info, and create a free wallet. Within that wallet you will find a button that says &quot;Cash Deposit.&quot; Click that and it uses bitinstant to complete the transaction. It does work. Also there is an extra option for anonymizing your coins.<br />

				Oh my god thank you! After I went to blockchain and created a wallet I recognized everything you need to do after you hit cash deposits! Dude seriously pat yourself on the back cuz you just made me so happy! Yay I can get all kinds of drugs again!

				Bitinstant is still working as of today. Yes, there is a $500 limit on all Moneygram to btc transactions.<br /><br />You can use https://blockexplorer.com/address/&lt;btc address goes here&gt; to check your deposits. Don&#039;t bother going to the homepage and searching for your address as the search is usually overloaded.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I was having a problem with bitinstant on the 30th of December, come to find out there was a glitch with the site (not sure on the status of the problem now) but it was saying my name was invalid, to get around this you just type all your info in lowercase letters.... the glitch is that the site is having trouble w/ uppercase for some strange reason? Anywho, hope I helped!<br /><br />Be Easy, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BG
