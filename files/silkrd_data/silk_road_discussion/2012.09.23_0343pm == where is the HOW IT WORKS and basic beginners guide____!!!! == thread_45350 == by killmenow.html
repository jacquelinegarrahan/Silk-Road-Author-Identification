				You know what worked for me?<br /><br />Research Bitcoins - where and how to buy them, anonymize them and transfer them.<br />Learn the basics of PGP. <br />Go at least 10 pages back in most of the subforums on this board - there&#039;s lots of answers for what you seek there.&nbsp; Start with this topic - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br />Remember that inherently, what you are about to do is probably illegal wherever you live. This means that you could both be arrested and prosecuted in a criminal court for whatever it is you intend to buy online. <br /><br />Seriously... it&#039;s not that hard. You&#039;ll learn a lot more if you take the time to research things than if you&#039;re told what to do.

				Totally disagree.&nbsp; It is hard to learn.<br /><br />Maybe you are technically proficient, that makes a huge difference.<br /><br />My advice to the OP is don&#039;t rush.&nbsp; It may take you days or a week to get a good grasp on everything needed to make a successful purchase.&nbsp; But once you&#039;ve done it, it&#039;s easy.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45350.msg481666#msg481666">Quote from: oban_18 on September 23, 2012, 04:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...<br />Seriously... it&#039;s not that hard.

You can deposit money at wal-mart or any place that sends moneygrams and you have the coins 10 minutes llater... then transfer the coins through a couple accounts before sending them here to SR if you want to be extra safe. <br />Some people use a combination of Dwolla and MtGox to send funds strait from your bank account to your bitcoin wallet especially is you need large amounts of BTC.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to write a step by step guide because there are dozens of them all you have to do is a simple search..<br /><br />Like seriously go to Google and search..<br />Use the forum search and you can find what you are looking for just as easily as I could if I did a google search and forums search and then posted the link here for you
