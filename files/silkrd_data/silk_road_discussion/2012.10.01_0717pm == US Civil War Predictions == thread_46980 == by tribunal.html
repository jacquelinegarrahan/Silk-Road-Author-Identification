				How will the next US Civil War get around? My guess is that California, Alaska, Texas will have a conflict with Eastern states once oil situation in the Middle East collapses. Maybe 2015.

				Civil unrest more likely. I doubt it&#039;ll be all out civil war (although i could be wrong!) The way things are going i expect the police state to be introduced when the dollar collapses (yes i have been researching these things... it is going to happen!)<br /><br />Next on the cards is the invasion of Iran and world war 3 with China/Russia and the introduction of the &quot;World Currency&quot; which will be cashless and purely digital. I often wonder how this will affect bitcoin.<br /><br />Things aint look good in the world!

				Something&#039;s got to happen at some point. I would guess that it has more to do with Federal control than availability of oil. I also don&#039;t think you&#039;d see California and Texas together, they&#039;re ideology is pretty far apart.<br /><br />I think what will happen is continued abuse and manipulation of our money by the Feds/Fed Reserve/banks/elites and continued abuse of power related to &quot;security&quot; to control people (Drones, Internet control, censorship, by the TSA, NSA, Homeland Security). At some point a group of people, or maybe states, will get fed up and say NO MORE and the Feds will say YES MORE and conflict will raise from there. Problem is the Feds are already throwing so much resources into controlling the population that it&#039;s going to take a lot of people pulling their heads out of the sand to make any difference.

				Texas would never ally with Ca. Never I live in Tx Texas may secede possibly bringing Louisiana and some other border states. However Texas will never never never join the wimpy nutty fruitcakes of California.....We got the guns we got the cattle and dammit we got the oil.

The governments all over are centralizing power, even here in the EU where they have recently announced they want a federation of states now and to centralise democracy into a single body, completely wiping out nation states and changing our identity from British to European (which is just shit, the British are quite arrogant and like to think of ourselves as better than Europe, which so far and historically we&#039;ve been quite right about).<br /><br />I think it will be a case of how desperate the US will get to hold onto power. The dollar will collapse the US will collapse, and I imagine many of your old enemies such as Iran, Russia, China, North Korea etc will be looking to make the most of it and aid its downfall. Unfortunately because our government like to have a bit of butt-secks together, the UK may be dragged down into the hell hole with you, but I hope UKIP (United Kingdon Independence Party, look for videos of their leader Nigel Farage and you&#039;ll see why I like the guy) get in control by then as they are completely against the idea of even being in the EU and want to seriously renegotiate many agreements between our countries.<br /><br />I think the death of the US is coming, they are in such a debt it is not possible to pay it back without cutting virtually everything the US government currently runs and when that happens, there will be chaos. If you have laws like we have in the UK where the government can seize all your assets and cash in times of &quot;national crisis&quot;, then they&#039;ll probably do that before they give up their power - and I do believe you have laws like this correct (any American able to confirm this for me?). People will finally wake up to realise every dollar spent by your government was not their dollar at all, but yours, the taxpayer, and they have promised to pay people money they know they can&#039;t pay sustainably without imposing all the citizens as virtually slave labour until their debt is repaid or the government is overthrown.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Although the US has created many enemies in the past we have one important ally, which is China. They control a good portion of the debt we owe. Any American can tell you this, shit 90% of our goods say &quot;Made in China&quot; on the back of them. We are the biggest importer of Chinese goods, China would never simply say, &quot;okay time to pay up&quot;, it would hurt their economy as well. Now what I believe is more possible is that if and when the dollar collapses (I&#039;m gonna play devils advocate) and we find ourselves being thrown to the wolves and other countries start making grabs at power with us China may &quot;aid&quot; us in these times, most likely resulting in either a puppet government controlled by the Chinese, or a backing of our dollar with precious metals (aka more debt). America in my opinion is too big to fail at this point. China, the undisputed heavyweight in the world right now, needs us, just as we need them, it is a symbiotic relationship. If the U.S. didn&#039;t exist who would buy their shit. <br /><br />This of course is just my opinion I base this very loosely on fact.

				They ain&#039;t seizing anything from this Texan. I got over a thousand rounds, I&#039;ll be&nbsp; submitting them one at a time and yeah I am U.S. Army trained expert rifleman. I can take a few of em before they even see me. This happened once, King George III was not at all happy about how that turned out. Hell as a Texan I can say we took ole Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna and showed him what for as well. Remember the Alamo remember Goliad! Most of all remember San Jacinto! Remember Gonzales!

				... OR .. the world economy recovers. <br />Iran chills the fuck out and abandons its nuclear aspirations in favor of refrigerators and MTV - a consumer based economy becomes the central focus of government.<br />China enters into a democratic system that balances socialism and free markets in a way not seen before.<br />Islam grows up and joins the other major religions in a spirit of moderation and tolerance.<br />Cars start running on electricity or hydrogen<br /><br />Meanwhile in the US - People stop equating guns with freedom and healthcare with tyranny. People realize that in a healthy democracy you can&#039;t always get your way and litigation rates decline. Government scales back spending and makes the basic infrastructure of roads, schools, hospitals and education it&#039;s primary focus.<br /><br />&nbsp;... ..&nbsp; mmmm Naw, Iran doesn&#039;t like MTV

It&#039;s worked fantastically in every place the US has invaded so far because when it gets down to the real up close combat, your rifle skills will count for shit if you&#039;re still left at this point, if you want to survive you better learn to run and hide, taking out only what you need to because no organised military can take on an enemy in guerrilla warfare, hence Vietnam and &quot;The War on Terror&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah I mean to be that guerrilla force, its what got the Brits outa the U.S. <br />And they ain&#039;t gonna nuke the U.S. not our govt at least.
