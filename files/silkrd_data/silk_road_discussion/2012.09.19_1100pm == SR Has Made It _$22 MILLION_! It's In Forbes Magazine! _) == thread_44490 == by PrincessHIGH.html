Yup, &#039;The War On Drugs&#039; has been a raving success, LOL! We&#039;re free to do whatever we want to with our bodies, and long may it continue! Of course, with much better feedback than any government agency, this speaks volumes within itself! :D<br /><br />Good read, it&#039;s a very interesting article, thought I&#039;d share it with everyone! :)

				What they don&#039;t say is how that number they came up with does not include bitcoin fluctuation, therefore making the whole study inaccurate.

				Thank god its only 22 mill!!!!<br /><br />that&#039;s peanuts in the big picture... The annual black market for illicit drugs is in the trillions...<br /><br />that means less LE eyes watching over it.

				So is it saying that the owner/administrators make this much a year or is this split between all vendors/administrators/owners? yeah 22 million sounds about right for what DPR himself would make in a year. he deserves every penny. the great thing is that if they were to find a way to shut us down than a new website doing the exact same thing would pop right up

				I think the actual amount is much higher than 22 million.&nbsp; There is no way for analysis of total qty of units bought and many people buy lots not just one qty each order.
