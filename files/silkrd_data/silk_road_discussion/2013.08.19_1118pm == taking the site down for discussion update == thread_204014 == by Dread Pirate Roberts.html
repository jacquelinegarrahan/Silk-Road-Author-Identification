				I don&#039;t want this thread appearing in my history every time someone makes a post, so I will be deleting this post as soon as what I&#039;ve written has been acknowledged.<br /><br />It appears the comments are formatted in some peculiar way which makes them at the very least unable to handle the Swedish Characters &quot;å&quot;, ä&quot; and &quot;ö&quot; as they get reverted to &quot;Ã¥&quot;, &quot;Ã¤&quot;, and &quot;Ã¶. I haven&#039;t tried any other special characters but I would suspect this might be the case with a lot of characters which are non-standard as possibly Cyrillic or Japanese Writing, might be worth checking out.

				Do the comments appear on the same page as where you can post about it? I haven&#039;t seen any comments yet, just taken to the page where you can post. It that just because no one has commented yet, or do you need to post a comment first to read the other comments? <br /><br />Maybe someone could post a vendor or page that already has a comment, just so we can get an idea of what it looks like. <br />

				Thanks for the link Bart.<br />As Gus said in your account settings you can choose an alias for these comments so people won&#039;t be able to link your buyer stats with your username.&nbsp; It seems like they set it up so you can&#039;t use an alias that is already a username for someone else.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only concern with the above is that a vendor could still link your comments based on your buyer stats. If you have bought from them, how long can they see your buyer stats, can they no longer see them once you have finalized?

				DPR you should make a red sticky announcement for the front page of sr detailing the new features, new people wont think or care to click on discussion before buying otherwise in my opinion, another idea is to show some of the most recent discussion directly on the vendor page without having to click discuss

It says on the questionmark &quot;Your alias will appear on your vendor reviews and in discussions. Use a name that is different than your main user name so your reviews and posts can not be linked to your account.&quot;<br /><br />Why should I change it? <br /><br />I got confused to be honest....

Otherwise rival vendors will go to town on one another. And spammers will take advantage of it. <br /><br />And unless SR staff wants to be bothered having to constantly moderate discussions, they should give the vendor moderator privileges to delete posts. Inflammatory post, false posts, spam(rival vendor spam, BTC scam spam), etc. would be most quickly dealt with by the vendor. SR staff might take hours or days to get around to it.<br /><br />It&#039;s a nice idea, but it&#039;s always best to think about how things can go wrong first before implementing. Especially when people are anonymous and doubly so with the use of aliases. <br />

				If someone left a comment on the discussion area for a vendor under an alias, and then ordered from that vendor, they could compare the stats and it wouldn&#039;t be too difficult to link the alias with the buyer. Trabsh has some good ideas above.&nbsp; &nbsp;It wouldn&#039;t really be a bad thing or a big deal, but if you are commenting on a vendor you order from they could easily figure it out.

				Best bet, give vendors the option to either enable or disable discussion on their profile and their listings if they choose. They should have the choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />After all, if vendors have the choice to go stealth or stealth individual listings, there&#039;s no reason why they shouldn&#039;t be able to enable or disable discussion. <br /><br />And you can even put a flag denoting that discussion is disabled so buyers know that the vendor chose to disable discussion.&nbsp; This would be especially useful for new vendors who are vulnerable to attack from rival vendors and feedback scamming buyers. They don&#039;t need the have to put up with the double whammy of feedback blackmail and now discussion post blackmail.

				As was thought, SR admins are very slow to moderate the comment pages on vendor profiles. Clicking &quot;report&quot; is as ineffective as when a buyer clicks &quot;report vendor.&quot; <br /><br />When vendors signed up, they agreed to changes in commissions without notice. That&#039;s fine. <br /><br />But they didn&#039;t sign on for things like a comment system that are out of their control and can act as another vector of attack. Give vendors the ability to activate/deactivate the discussion. And next time, how about having a vote on new features that affect vendor&#039;s business?
