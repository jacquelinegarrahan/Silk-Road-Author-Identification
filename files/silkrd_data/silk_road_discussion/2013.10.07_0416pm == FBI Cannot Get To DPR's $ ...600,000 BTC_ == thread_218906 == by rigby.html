				www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/fbi-bitcoin-silk-road-ross-ulbricht<br /><br />Clearnet article on how the FBI can&#039;t get to DPR&#039;s personal BTC. Supposedly, 600,000 BTC. <br /><br />Hopefully, some of that was cashed out and buried in the desert, somewhere...<br /><br />FUCK THE FBI

				Jesus Christ guys use your brains...<br /><br />The bitcoins they seized were what was currently &quot;on the site&quot; if you will, the vast fortune that DPR has accumulated has been accumulating since SR first started.. this is not something he would of kept on the SR serves or on his personal computer. Who knows where it is..

				Depending on the case they have against DPR, I just don&#039;t see him getting out of prison ever, mostly due to ordering the fake hits, that&#039;s how they really fucked him. It is just like how they get these domestic terrorism cases nowadays. Makes them look great to hold up a bust under ceremonial banner so to speak, of some violent radical terrorists that truly wouldn&#039;t have been involved with any of the activities they were ultimately charged with it wasn&#039;t for the FBI manufacturing the situation, and then presenting it to them just to bust someone, anyone they can to just feel like they&#039;re effective and doing they&#039;re jobs. I guess FBI agents have to worry about their jobs just like anyone else in light of the government shutdown and furloughs and whatnot. Bureaucrats are fucked up imo.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, I digress, if he cuts a deal or cooperates to some degree, which he undoubtedly will, surrendering ALL his BTC for seizure, his mostly illegal proceeds from a very illegal venture will be the first thing on that list of requirements for leniency, next to giving up the actual IRL people the FBI can track down that are also involved with SR&#039;s operation whether past or present, this includes giving up the former DPR. If there ever was an original DPR, and this man arrested is predecessor or his second in command.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				That would be a bit problematic though - how can you ever tell if you have seized -all- btc from a person? He could have spread this money over say 25 wallets and give up 15 of them. Once everything is processed, perhaps even jailtime served, those remaining 10 wallets are still there and the only person that can prove they exist would be the guy himself. <br /><br />Then again, stories go more fantastic by the day. If he actually has &gt;$60 million worth of btc breaking out of prison seems feasible too. Its certainly enough to purchase a decent helicopter and a hire small army of goons with guns for a couple of days :D
