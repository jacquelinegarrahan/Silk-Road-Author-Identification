				My guess on this is i&#039;m completely wrong (hopefully) but no harm in asking others....when trying to connect to sr forums does anybody else have the same issue I&#039;ve had since the outage?<br /><br />1st attempt to connect results in connection error....every time...the 2nd attempt then connects to the forums fine.... every time...it&#039;s as if once it fails to the url i type it will then connect to the forums...<br /><br />Any ideas?

				This has happened to me everytime as well. I am not the most computer savy person tho so the meaning to me is unclear if not just a simply .onion fault.<br /><br />Can anyone with knowledge shed some light on this?

				I have had similar problems. Could it just be server overload? I don&#039;t know that it is actually redirecting, but I could be wrong. I was under the impression it was just not able to connect to the server on the first, second try.

				it does appear though as if you have to fail before it will connect....since the outage ive not had it connect first time...which lead to paranoid thoughts of it possible redirecting while still masked under the original url....like i mentioned, i imagine theres reasoning behind it but odd that others have the same issues...also noticed a huge increase in dodgy looking threads.

				Ive been seeing the exact same behavior. I don&#039;t think it means anything though, since the same thing often happens when I try to connect to any onion site. It fails the first one or two times , then works.&nbsp;

				Its most likely because the road is down and we have all these people who would otherwise never even access the forums are now making new accounts to see whats happening.. like explosive growth (haha.. sound familiar) or just too many people trying to connect at once..
