				Hello everyone, <br /><br />I recently registered and figured all this out, about a week ago, I transferred around 1k in cash to bitcoins and sent it to a seller on SR. We had been talking for 3 days before and I was asking for a larger amount of product than he usually does, so I just transferred him the money. I did not think to use the system on the website as he is a very reputable seller with very high feedback.<br /><br />He told me he shipped my order early morning friday, and it has now been 5 business days. He shipped express(next day delivery) and the tracking does not even show online. It says it doesn&#039;t exist yet. <br /><br />Does anyone know what I should do? <br /><br />He is telling me to wait a little while for him to reship, but I think my money was taken as there is no evidence of the package online...

				If it&#039;s coming from Canada:<br /><br />1. Canada post sucks balls. (slow, infrequent updates)<br />2. I&#039;ve had things take 2 weeks from there.

				I hate the be the bad news bear but the escrow is there for a reason, when you don&#039;t use it then you are taking a huge gamble.&nbsp; The most you can do is wait, maybe he sent it, maybe he didn&#039;t. Either way if you do not receive anything there is nothing that can be done about it except mentioning it in the rumor mill like someone did to LTTM, but in the end, its your lose

				Both of us are in the US.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t really understand the escrow system, and he only sold little amounts and I did not know I had to use the website at the time.

				I would try not to worry too much yet if it&#039;s a reputable seller. Sometimes the USPS just really sucks (I&#039;m also waiting on a package that should have already arrived). This is the second time it&#039;s taken a long time to arrive, last time was via priority mail and it ended up taking exactly 7 days from the time it was shipped.<br /><br />If you read through the forums you can find a few previous threads on packages taking a long time to arrive with strange tracking messages. They always tend to show up after 7-12 days. It sucks, I know, but that&#039;s the USPS. I can certainly understand why the vendor wouldn&#039;t want to re-ship an expensive order when it&#039;s only been 5 days.<br /><br />You&#039;re probably just fine, but next time ask for a custom listing and use escrow for the extra peace of mind :) If you really think you&#039;re being scammed you can call out the seller here in the forums.

				I was just asking to see if anyone had situations like this, now that I&#039;ve seen other people have, and according to him he has before too, I will wait it out. <br /><br />He said he will reship in a week if it doesn&#039;t come, I think i&#039;m just getting a little too worried. No need to say anything until I know for sure. <br /><br />Thanks for the help

				It&#039;s just a way to avoid paying SR for their services.&nbsp; Use their site, find the drug you want, and then don&#039;t pay them for what they provide?&nbsp; That percentage they get get on sales keeps this site up for the rest of us. Play by the rules and then you can get help when things go south.&nbsp; There&#039;s always a good story going along with it, too, but I don&#039;t bite.&nbsp; I think if a few more people get ripped off, maybe they&#039;ll realize what &#039;escrow&#039; is there for...I get these offers thru pms regularly, but it&#039;s just a waste of bits to me...
