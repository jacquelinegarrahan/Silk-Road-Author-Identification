				DPR might be saying they&#039;ve plugged the hole that the hackers got in through but there is still a problem with adding postage options to a listing.<br /><br />You can still only add a postage option if there are no spaces between any of the words<br /><br />1stClassSignedFor - I can add that fine<br />1st Class Signed For - I get a message saying you can only use letters A-Z and numbers 1-9 in a red box just like yesterdays hack. <br /><br />Since when could you not have a space in between your postage option words?<br /><br />We&#039;re top 8% sellers, I think we know when there&#039;s a problem or not. <br /><br />The leak might be plugged but all the issues are not sorted yet. <br /><br />KS<br /><br />

				This is pure speculation but if the attack was indeed SQL based...<br /><br />Maybe part of plugging the hole was performing input sanitation on the postage option for vendors as this is the field they were using to attack.<br /><br />In doing this part of the input they decided not to allow was the spaces....<br /><br />Again just a theory, but it could provide a reasonable explanation of why the site is acting this way but DPR doesn&#039;t think it is hacked.<br /><br />Would be nice for him to confirm this...

				I created a listing for samples on Monday, I could not use spaces in the shipping options then. Not sure what this means.
