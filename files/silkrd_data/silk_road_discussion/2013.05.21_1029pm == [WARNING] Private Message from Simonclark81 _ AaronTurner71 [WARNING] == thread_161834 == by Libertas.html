				Hi all,<br /><br />Many vendors have received the following message from somebody going by the name of Simonclark81 / AaronTurner71:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi, I&#039;m not sure if you are the right person or not, but I live near to you and have noticed you making quite a few deliveries to the mailbox, some of which I managed to get on video... search for &#039;silk road **** ****&#039; on www.********.us and click on the the first video and you will be able to see.<br /><br />This is not a threat, I am just trying to pre warning you to be more careful when mailing things. (and maybe send someone else to the mailbox instead of yourself) Although I wouldn&#039;t say no to a free sample :)<br /><br />P.S If it is not you in the video, then you can ignore this<br /><br />Simon / Aaron<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have edited the description and link in order to prevent anyone here from falling into this trap. If you receive this message, please delete it immediately. Please do not follow the link if you see it posted elsewhere.<br /><br />Going to the site included in the message will automatically run a Java applet that either attempts to &quot;phone home&quot; - sending your IP address to a third party, thereby de-anonymising you - or attempts to download / run some malware that could compromise your system and would more than likely contain a keylogger / datalogger which could steal your Silk Road login information and PIN, if entered.<br /><br />Discussion of the message in question and what it may be attempting to accomplish can be found here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161802.msg1151537#msg1151537<br /><br />A very helpful member, astor, has confirmed the following:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161802.msg1151719#msg1151719">Quote from: astor on May 21, 2013, 09:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That is confirmed malware. I just spoke to someone who visited that site, actually ran the Java, and now multiple anti-virus programs detect malware on his computer where there was none before.<br /><br />Now to determine whether it&#039;s LE or some random asshole who wants to install keyloggers to steal account credentials, or possibly enumerate the IP addresses of vendors and blackmail them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />EDIT: astor has just given us the following update:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161802.msg1151890#msg1151890">Quote from: astor on May 21, 2013, 10:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is the exact malware on that site.

				Thanks scout, astor and I spoke. He gave me some safety tips, and got me started in the right direction, but ultimately i just spent the past how ever man hours its been, learning how to manually find and remove malware through registry edit. With the help of like 4 different anti malware programs, i was able to dispose of the bugs for good.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;A total fucking nightmare. On the bright side, ive learned more about computers and viruses in the past 5 hours than some will learn in a lifetime, lol.<br /><br />&nbsp;My only concerns are whether or not there was actually a key logger, as one of the bugs was called dclog or something like that, secondly if my IP was possibly compromised.&nbsp;

				Perhaps if anyone knows how to tell whether or not you have been infected by the malware, they could let people know on here? My anti-virus picked it up and stopped the java applet from running at all, though I still have a certain level of paranoia about me and now I don&#039;t want to log in or out of anything, just to be safe! My computer knowledge is basic at best, so anyone who can point to potential signs of infection would help in reassuring me, and I&#039;m sure many others!<br /><br />In the meantime, safety precautions must be taken! Time to move my wares and leave the country!

				What bastards. Can someone explain to this computer berk how our ip&#039;s could be com promised if we&#039;re using TOR, java apps or flash or anything won&#039;t run either, the TOR bundle has nothing installed for playing videos or stuff like that.

				Thank you for the warning!&nbsp; 8)<br />If you have been infected...I am no expert myself but it might be a good idea to reinstall the whole operating system. I would be afraid that something was left behind which was not detected.

				Not sure if this will ease minds, but if you are stuck on a static IP address change it your self on a regular basis. <br /><br />Type &quot;cmd&quot; in the search box. <br /><br />The entry for the Command Prompt should now be visible. Left-click on it to open it up.<br /><br />Type ipconfig /release in the command window and press Enter.<br /><br />Once the IP has been released, a new one can be obtained.<br /><br />Type ipconfig /release in the command window and press Enter.<br /><br />&nbsp;Childs Play : )..<br /><br />p.s.&nbsp; make thats a SPACE between the forward slash, IE<br /><br />&nbsp;ipconfig(space)/renew<br /><br /><br />forgot to add:<br /><br />if your on a fast BB fiber connection, this process should be instant almost, if your still on 56k modem i would make camp for the night........<br />

				What do these scammers hope for if they send out the same message to all vendors? That a few will be suckered in before everyone gets the wise? They must not think vendors communicate together in the forums. I&#039;m getting really sick of these chancers, and I&#039;m just a buyer

				For any one concerned, the anti bots i used where as follows..Malwarebytes, aswMBR, spybot search &amp; destroy, rkill, tdsskiller and lastly junkware removal tool.<br /><br />Most of the time the scans produced nothing, then after a restart some where back, or just one or two. <br /><br />In order to successfully remove all threats the rootkits have to be removed.
