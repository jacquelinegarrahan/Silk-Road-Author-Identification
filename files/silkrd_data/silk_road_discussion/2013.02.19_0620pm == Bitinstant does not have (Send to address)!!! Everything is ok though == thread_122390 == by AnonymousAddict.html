				This news is four days old now. They do claim it will be back, but they&#039;ve already gone longer than they said on two different occasions. BitInstant is fucking useless. Even when their website shows the bitcoin address option, they fuck it up after you deposit the cash and then you have to wait for them to fix it. They need to get their shit together or they&#039;re going to be irrelevant in six months.

				Just curious.. What do most people use for Bitcoins nowadays?<br /><br />I&#039;ve found Bitcopia to be way better than Bit instant.

				It&#039;s been a hell of a mess the last several days with SR down thu/fru for a few hrs, then add to that Bitinstant problems getting coins to addresses with very little info from them about whats up. The last big update about this issue Ive found was posted here:<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18r5hi/update_on_weekend_bitinstant_transactions/<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks like Bitinstant hasnt updated the main message on that page which says they expected to have the bitcoin to address option restored.&nbsp; Even if they&#039;re not sure when it will be fixed, it does help somewhat to get some sort of updated messages to let you know how it&#039;s goin and they&#039;re on top of it..&nbsp; DPR did a great job updating everyone who tried signing into SR with the redirected message to the forums until the site was back up on Thurs night/Friday so that kinda shit goes a long way to keep most customers informed..<br /><br />If anyone has any more current info than the link I posted above, please let ppl know in the thread here and if possible post a link as well.&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched the bitcointalk site but searches suck and it&#039;s TMI.&nbsp; You get tons of old msgs from last year when similar probs happened and I dont want to wade thru outdated shit, even when I used advanced search for recent topics.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would be nice if Bitinstant just put a link on their main page for customers cuz you know damn well tons of people only use the &#039;bitcoin to address&#039; option.&nbsp; Even though they keep insisting &quot;the bitinstant site isnt down&quot;, thats not entirely true cuz I havent been able to get on bitinstant all day today thru Tor, but the site loads on clearnet and it still doesnt have the bitcoin to address option, so they&#039;re putting a stupid spin on the issues.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly and equally concerning is the message on bitinstants about low reserves on bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve seen the low reserves message quite a bit on their site since i started using them a few months ago...&nbsp; &nbsp;Considering the sole nature of their business is moving bitcoins,&nbsp; its like Alpo runnin low on dogfood or some crap like that.&nbsp; Maybe someone can shed some light on how/why they keep runnin low...<br /><br />

				Im so happy i found this thread.&nbsp; I thought i was going crazy!&nbsp; Ive been dying to get my hands on some cannabis because im dry and for 2 weeks now i havent been able to.&nbsp; I use blockchain.info and everytime i clicked on cash deposit it would tell me i was entering an invalid exchange.&nbsp; I made 2 new wallets and nothing.&nbsp; On fridsay i got an email saying it would be back up this past monday, today i sent another email and rachel told me itd be back tomorrow. <br />I hope they get their shit together because life without cannabis is horrible, my stress levels are through the roof!

				So I tried bitfloor at&nbsp; https://bitfloor.com/docs/#trading-basics<br /><br />It&#039;s fucking working like better then ever. I did the bank deposit and then it showed up in my account at bitfloor before I got back home and that was in 15 minutes! I done my first trade and had bit coin in my account in an hour. <br /><br />Have at it guys!

				Its the 23rd and they still dont have it up, wtf, i thought bitinstant would become the gold standard by which everyone embraced bitcoin, now they&#039;re just another sketchy unreliable service.<br /><br />dont say bitcopia is any good cause if you go to their buy page this is all it says<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Buy Bitcoins<br /><br />Buy orders are usually accepted M-Th 9AM - 7:00PM EST and Friday 9AM - 4PM EST.

				Yeah BitInstant has gotten more and more difficult to use as time has gone on.&nbsp; I think they&#039;ve been having issues with their partners.&nbsp; Maybe the IRS is cracking down on their partners or something?
