				Hello all,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to this whole ordering of illegal substances and objects online, I&#039;m also new to bitcoin.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d like to point out I don&#039;t want to get off on the wrong foot and the questions I&#039;m asking are because I am a noob and want to better understand how this all works, mainly that of prices in relation to BC.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing my research on BCs and as of today (23/09/2012) it seems the current rate for 1BC is in the region of the £7 mark. I understand that bitcoins exchange rate can fluctuate dramatically and at any given point it may not be the same, but, from searching SR for weed I&#039;m quite shocked to find that most vendors (and this isn&#039;t a personal bash at you guys btw!!!) sell 1g for about 2BC - 3.5BC, which is roughly in the area of £14/ £25.<br />I know the product type itself can be quite pricy based on the type of strain, but really, £14 - £25 for 1g of weed? Is this normal? <br />I know I can get similar strains around where I live for £20 at around 2.5g - 3g.<br />I haven&#039;t ordered anything yet, but I do plan to once Bitcoin gets all the data from it&#039;s server, and I will only order weed from within the U.K. because it&#039;s safer that way. Please, to any U.K. vendors that read this, I am not saying you&#039;re ripping people off with your prices, I am just trying to understand the prices.<br /><br />So my questions is, is this normal, and do people buy weed at this price for the amount their getting when compared to what you can get from a dealer on a street, and if so, why?<br /><br />Thank you to anyone that can answer these questions, and once again, this is simply for my understanding. I do not want to get off on the wrong foot or piss anyone off, I apologise if I have done.

				It is because the vendors have enough demand at those prices. In other words, enough customers are finding these prices to be worth it for what they are getting.<br /><br />I would suggest just giving it a try and seeing if the value of the product/service is worth it for you. I also recommend getting a larger amount then 1-3.5g. You should be getting a better price for your money when buying 28g or more at a time.

				There are other threads on this board that also make reference to extra time and materials in packaging dealing with bitcoins sellers fees... and the list goes on.&nbsp; &nbsp; I so far don&#039;t mind paying abit extra to sit at home and get my stuff mail order and I sure dont mind paying someone to do it right the first time!

				This is an online market place not the street. <br /><br />Street dealers don&#039;t have to deal with currency fluctuations, sales commissions, postage &amp; packaging, seized shipments, complicated and expensive money laundering setups, but vendors here do. Street dealers get paid immediately, Vendors do not. That is a massively important point.<br /><br />There are many reasons why people buy from this website. The beauty of a free market is that you&#039;re not obligated to buy anything. If you can get a better price elsewhere and are comfortable buying your goods that way this website has little in the way to offer you. For others less fortunate it is an incredibly valuable market place.<br /><br />I think prices here are very cheap considering the amount of work involved in Vending.

				if you have amazing street connects then it may not be worth it, but to some the convenience, variety, vendor reviews etc are worth it to people without other options especially.&nbsp; not everyone can obtain high grade bud where they live<br /><br />plus you need to remember every order will have a percentage added on to the vendors price to pay SR
