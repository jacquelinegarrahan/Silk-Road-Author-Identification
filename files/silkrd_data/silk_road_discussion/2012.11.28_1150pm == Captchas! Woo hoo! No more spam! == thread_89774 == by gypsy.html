				Hey - where&#039;s the thread celebrating Captcha&#039;s?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t anyone celebrating?&nbsp; I had to respond to a Captcha to post just a minute ago... No More Spam!&nbsp; At least for a while... woo hooo!&nbsp; Thanks, DPR<br /><br />EDIT 11/29:&nbsp; The fucking bitkoin spammer dude is back. He registered an account and he&#039;s posting to the boards.&nbsp; The mods are deleting him and his posts but the fucker is back. And now he&#039;s spamming me via PM&nbsp; :o

				I absolutely hate it.&nbsp; To post, edit, or nearly anything else I have to type more and we all know time is money.&nbsp; There are a number of ways of preventing spam without the use of annoying captchas.&nbsp; <br /><br />1)&nbsp; Post restrictions based on join date or number of posts in total or made daily<br />2)&nbsp; Delays such as 30/ 60 seconds between posts<br />3)&nbsp; More low-level mods who could temp lock the account of a spammer.<br />4)&nbsp; Make the spammers suffer by forcing captchas on them!&nbsp; After 20-50 legit posts, no more captchas.<br /><br />While definitely an improvement and useful for the short-term, I would use another solution long-term.<br /><br />PS:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; An edit of my OWN post makes me fill out yet ANOTHER captcha!&nbsp; &nbsp; Who is really getting punished here?!?!?!&nbsp; &nbsp; LMAO

				Woo hoo! No more pages full of irritating bkcoin (and their many other annoying aliases) spam thank-you very much DPR and team. Looking at the members who have mentioned captchas appearing, it would be my logical assumption to think captchas cease when you become a &#039;Full Member&#039; at 100 posts. It&#039;s so refreshing to see our forums (almost) spam free ;D

				It would be nice to have a confirmation of when these captchas will disappear when something like this is implemented on the forum (unless I missed it).&nbsp; If the number is 100 posts, it should be reduced to 50 or even less.&nbsp; There is no need to penalize those of us following the rules when a total post count of only 25 would have the same effect.&nbsp; If it did not, move it to 50.<br /><br />Can a mod clarify when these annoying captchas will disappear the majority of us that don&#039;t spam?<br /><br /><br />Luv,<br />Party Girl

It&#039;s not hard to get to 100 posts either, all you have to do is be part of the community and you will reach it soon enough. Keep up the good work!
