				I started this thread for vendors to vent about some things that buyers do that are annoying and to make them aware of those things. The intention of this post is to make buyers aware of things they may be doing that are annoying to vendors. Lets not mention specific names, it would be better if we kept this to a general topic rather than talk about specific occurrences. I&#039;m going to list a few things that vendors have posted in another thread:<br /><br />1. Messages vendor same day for &quot;shipping estimate&quot;<br />2. Messages vendor for tracking number when it&#039;s stated that we do not give them out.<br />3. Messages vendor to track their package 1-2 days after marking it in transit.<br />4. Messages vendor to ask where a package is mailed from in the country.<br />5. Messages vendor with idle chit chat for 2 pages then asks a question finally.<br />6. Acts entitled to a custom order just because they can be made.<br />7. Haggles you to death for bulk and never orders.<br />8. Haggling in general. I am up for some from a long time customer for bulk, but honestly folks it gets tiresome to negotiate only to NEVER ORDER!!!!<br />9. Taking more than a day to finalize. I track ALL my orders and KNOW you have my drugs.<br />10. Leaves less than 5/5 feedback for anything short of ripping you off or flat out lying. This is my biggest pet peeve for buyers is that a 4/5 is just as bad as a 1/5 on the rating system.<br />11. Asking vendors personal questions.<br />12. Not encrypting shipping info.<br />13. Using fake Names or Addresses.<br />14. Trying to use other vendors pricing/product to haggle with you. It&#039;s apples and oranges folks my drugs are not his.

				I think this is a good thread.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am primarily a buyer and most of these seem pretty obvious and common sense.... But I honestly didn&#039;t know that #s 1 and 3 annoy vendors. Is it because of some kind of safety issue that vendors don&#039;t want to give you a delivery estimate or tracking? Or is it just because it just takes too much time for the vendor?<br /><br />&nbsp;Honestly as a buyer, it puts my mind at ease to know when to expect the package. It helps because I know when I need to be around to get the mail before my housemates. Unfortunately, I can&#039;t be home every morning to wait for the mail :(

				I&#039;m relieved to be able to say that I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever done any of those things.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a lot of respect for the vendors here and the service they provide.&nbsp; To be honest I&#039;ve been on SR now for almost five months and I&#039;m still in awe of this place every time a parcel comes to my front door. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I could ever ask someone to lower their pricing unless I was going to order something in bulk and even then I wouldn&#039;t ask for a bulk order if I wasn&#039;t ready to place the order immediately.<br /><br />It&#039;s crazy to me that people can be that disrespectful to the people supplying their recreation/addiction/whatever.&nbsp; So it goes.<br /><br />I hope this post will be an eye-opener for some.<br /><br />Thanks OP!

				Howabsurd - It&#039;s more of a time thing, for me anyway.&nbsp; From a buyer&#039;s standpoint it&#039;s only one message, but if everyone who ordered from me sent me those messages I wouldn&#039;t be able to do much else.&nbsp; SR isn&#039;t the fastest loading website, so just waiting for the messages to open is frustrating.<br /><br />&nbsp;- Customers that describe packaging! Should be a given, but apparently it&#039;s not.&nbsp; I had to get the admin to remove info from my feedback after someone went into detail on how I&#039;d shipped their product. x.x; <br /><br />Seconded on #10 btw. Got negged a while back because someone thought my Pineapple Express tasted like weed, not pineapple.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t even sure what to say at that point.&nbsp; ???

If a vendor is one person, then many of those thing take much time from one person vendor. <br /><br />Also, many do not realize that 4/5 is almost bad as 1/5. That is SR fault. So you have to talk to buyer and fix what little thing bother them. If you are nice, they are nice too. :)<br /><br />But if you get buyer who try the scam, well you do best you can to make buyer happy and note who buyer is for future and take care not to do business with again. You can no win them all.

				Good thread. I&#039;m not a vendor but I deal with a lot of internet sales IRL. In my experience customers DO NOT read main info page. I cannot tell you the amount of times I have gotten asked a question that was already answered if they just took the time to read the product&#039;s page. So I feel a vendors pain and try to be cool and as patient as I can be.

				I can see a scenario like this happening:<br /><br />SR gets compromised -&gt; addresses get crossreferenced -&gt; the cops show up to the address and find drugs, seize computers -&gt; buyer hasn&#039;t taken proper safety measures and it&#039;s found out that they bought through SR, the pigs offer a lighter sentence if the buyer reveals who they bought from, now the seller is in danger.<br /><br />This is a worst case, cascading failure type of scenario but it isn&#039;t too difficult to picture.

				i still don&#039;t see how that&#039;s any worse than customs finding drugs, informing police, questioning suspect ...and so on. if the vendor has got their security tight they should be fine. imo buyers using third party sites to do their pgp for them or even using privnote is worse than sending in plain text.

If the vendor has got everything on lock, then good. But I have seen a lot of laziness and greed here, and that affects security. And of course, even the best slip up.<br /><br />Like I said, though, it seems that getting busted depends on a chain of events. We don&#039;t need to make the pigs&#039; job easier for them.<br /><br />And no, do not ever use privnote or other third party &quot;encryption&quot; solutions. They are known to actively cooperate with LE.

				I&#039;m globally in agreement with op, but, about 9, some buyers get orders sent to places they don&#039;t check daily, or to people who might take time to warn them or reship. A small delay in finalizing should be excusable.&nbsp; As for 10, new buyers and buyers not reading the forums aren&#039;t informed that vendors ratings are as affected from a 4/5 as they are from a 1/5. And it&#039;s completely counter intuitive.
