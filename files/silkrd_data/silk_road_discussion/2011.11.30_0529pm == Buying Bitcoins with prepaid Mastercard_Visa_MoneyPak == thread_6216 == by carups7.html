				What is the best way to use my prepaid card to purchase bitcoins?&nbsp; Very few exchanges accept payment by Visa/Mas - anyone know which is the best/cheapest?<br /><br />Does anyone still accept MoneyPak?&nbsp; I have found it offered as a &quot;payout&quot; method, but not as a purchasing method.<br /><br />Please Help!!&nbsp; I have placed an order with centregold.com but they are expensive and time-consuming.

				Go to the main Silk Road page, and click on the &quot;money&quot; link on the left. Use one of those trusted sellers who are exchanging Moneypaks for Bitcoins. I personally recommend BTCBuddy, because I&#039;ve had two successful transactions with him, and he has lots of good feedback.

				use bitcoin-otc<br /><br />you can always find a seller for Moneypak there and there is far less a chance of getting scammed/ripped off as there is using an SR exchanger

				Quick noob question:&nbsp; Where do you get MoneyPak cards (or is it codes)?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m trying to find a quicker way to get dollars to bitcoins and waiting for bank transfer is the hardest part for me now that I&#039;ve become acclimated to the way SR/BTC works.&nbsp; thanks!

				You can get them at just about any convenience store like CVS, Walgreens, or Rite aid. It&#039;s just about $5 and then you can load anywhere from $20-500 on it. Very easy and I would suggest looking at bitcoin-otc as the better deals you can get on there are worth the time it takes to figure it out.

				BTC Buddy got me my first BitCoins. Highly recommended, check his feedback.<br /><br />Still, for regular purchasing, you&#039;re spending at least 10% of your money on the exchange service... If I could find a trader who brings it around 5%, I wouldn&#039;t bother looking for a better way to fund my account,but 10% is just a lil too much on top of the $5 each new card costs. <br /><br />On another note, I&#039;ve had offers on these forums to trade MP for BTC at current BTC value.. I assume most of these users are scammers but I&#039;m sure there are honest people who just want to cash out their BTC without charging a service fee. You can find threads about the topic on Bitcointalk, but still, you&#039;d have to make sure its a user you can trust, there is no escrow when you just hand a MP# over to someone.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to check out BTC OTC, since I keep hearing good things about it.<br /><br />
