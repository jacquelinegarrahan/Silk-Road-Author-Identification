				Didn&#039;t really know where to post this, so I&#039;m gonna post it here. I&#039;m looking to pick up bulk product for my pills and now I have about 10 people from China trying to get me to send them money. Are there any ways to know if they&#039;re legit besides SoS? Only a few of them have comments and none of them have reviews.

Also, depending on what your getting, some times the stuff they get takes time to get to them...If that make sense..&nbsp; What i mean is the roads in some areas are fucked, and trucks get stuck and break down... I know its nice to get low cost goods but man its rough when you don&#039;t have a buyer over there you can trust. and that is in any country... <br />i don&#039;t buy from China been fucked to many times, and if they have a way to contact you , they will drill you like a two bit car salesman. <br />that&#039;s my two cents.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Googleyed seems a good contact on SR, with the kind of stuff he can get i&#039;m sure he resides near China or something.
