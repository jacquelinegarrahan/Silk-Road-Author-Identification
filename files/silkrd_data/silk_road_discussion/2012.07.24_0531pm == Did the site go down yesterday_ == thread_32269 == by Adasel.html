				I&#039;m not sure if anyone else had it, but when i got back from work yesterday 5:15pm GMT, i tried a LOT of times to access the SR forums but it just wasnt happening.&nbsp; After about 8pm i gave up.&nbsp; I even tried the &quot;Is it up?&quot; site to test.&nbsp; It said the site was up but with a 503 error.&nbsp; At this point i couldnt be bothered to look into it.<br />Anyone else get this?

				i did notice sometime yesterday afternoon in the eastern time zone that SR was unavailable intermittantly. if you&#039;ve been following whats going on DPR is rolling out a make over for the site. until the new look is launched i wouldnt worry about the site being down as im sure it will be up and down a bit while he is working on the cut over. SR always comes back so dont worry friends : ) DPR has us covered. <br /><br />

				Basically, if you pull up the Tor interface you can select the &quot;new user&quot; feature that changes all your connections to make it appear you are using Tor for the first time.&nbsp; Its an icon shaped like a head, facebook looking thing.
