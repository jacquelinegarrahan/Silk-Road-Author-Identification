				Yeah, its the holidays <br /><br />They are probably backed up from the past week or two, and I&#039;m sure theres still a huge influx of christmas/new years mail coming through USPS right now.<br /><br />Shit will probably be slow for another week or two, hopefully less

				You would think there would be an influx in mail sent around the holidays which would cause an increase in delivery times.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t you?&nbsp; Also being closed on NYD and Christmas day.

				It could be from where it&#039;s being shipped too. For example, vendor brutusk lives in a rural area so it can a day or two to clear the first sorting facility.

				My domestic priority mail has been fine, Had something go out last friday and got Monday.. Today to my surprise, after 20+ days of waiting, I had actually giving up on getting this package from EU, And damn if it wasnt sitting in my Mailbox today! Iv been waiting on these Benzos forever!! Other people who order&#039;d after me got theirs so i thought it got lost or a postal worker was fucked up on my pills.. Made my day!! And also restored all faith in the vendor..
