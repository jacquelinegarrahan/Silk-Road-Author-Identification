				I don&#039;t like it because I can&#039;t edit by rating and feed back for orders after the fact anymore. I always give a 5 when it shows up and I&#039;ll see how everything is and come back to the comment and rating. Now I can&#039;t seem to find where I do that. Did they remove this ability?

It unsettles them. Any type of website overhaul always gets people whinging. Personally, I like that there&#039;s a discussion area and I like it in general. But give it a few months and everyone will have forgotten the old system and be whinging at DPR about something else. Personally, I&#039;ve been happy as a veritable pig in poo since the day I discovered SR. DPR can tweak it to his heart&#039;s content, so long as I can order my drug of choice to my home (and there&#039;s some real créme de la créme on here) then he can do what he likes.

				For what it&#039;s worth at first i thought the new system was a terrible idea but after using it a few times i reckon it&#039;s made me(and hopefully others)make a more honest review rather than just hitting 5/5 and cracking on.Can&#039;t comment on the scammer side of things surely they could always threaten a low score?I only marked a vendor down who i received an underweight order from.I honestly wouldn&#039;t recommend them and explained the reason&#039;s why in my review.<br />Surely if all buyers were more honest about there purchase then when a scammer threatens a 4/5 review it wouldn&#039;t matter so much?

Doesn&#039;t show up until next Wednesday, has a hole in the envelope where you can see the mylar, your 3 PMs were ignored.

				There is no incentive to leave feedback. That&#039;s one problem. The other is that there is no way to update on product quality later. You can wait to leave your feedback but that&#039;s not good enough and further reduces incentive since you&#039;ll probably forget to do it later on. While I agree that allowing to change feedback can lead to all kinds of abuse by both buyers and sellers (this happened to me with one seller), and I like the change made, you should be able to ADD additional feedback later. No changing anything. Just allow for one addition later on within a 30 or 60 day time limit after purchase for feedback on quality.<br /><br />SR is a work in progress. Hopefully more will be done to incentivize feedback and allow for the sharing of opinions on product quality on every vendor&#039;s listing. The discussion section and vendor review threads on the forums isn&#039;t good enough. It needs to be more direct, transparent and accessible.

				I like that you can finalize without the need the leave a review immediately, that helps FE&#039;s. :)<br />The old system was better in terms of view ability. Even after the shrinking DPR did. Also not having the ability to edit your feedback is very bad.<br /><br />The incentive to leave feedback is build into me, so that is not a problem, I&#039;m always happy when I have the opportunity to write something about the transaction.
