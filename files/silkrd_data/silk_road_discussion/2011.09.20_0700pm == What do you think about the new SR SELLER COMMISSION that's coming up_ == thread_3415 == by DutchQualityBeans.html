				&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SR staff is about to introduce a commision system, exact details of this will be provided by SR staff.<br />But for the early thoughts of this new feature I made a poll...&nbsp; :D&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />This is an automated message to all Silk Road sellers:<br /><br />Some of you are just joining us as sellers, others have been here since the beginning. Wherever you came into this game, I hope you are having fun :) For those just coming in, I want to give you a little history.<br /><br />Starting out, there were no commissions on sales. Sellers got 100% of what the buyer paid and there wasn&#039;t even a fee to become a seller! This might sound great for sellers, but paradoxically, I think things got much better when we started charging for accounts and adding a commission. Why? Because buyers had more reason to trust you and do business with you, and Silk Road finally had a revenue stream to invest in advanced server security and feature development.<br /><br />When we started charging a commission, I just picked a number, something like 5.25%. This was added on to every sale, so that sellers got what they listed the item for and buyers only saw one price. I was hoping this would give me the flexibility to change the commission rate at will without too much fuss from the community, but I soon found that many cared very much about this number, especially when I raised it by 1% to 6.25%.<br /><br />From my perspective, I would like this number to be as high as possible without causing sales to drop for you, but I have no idea where that point is. It could be 5%, 10% or even 20%, I just don&#039;t know. I&#039;m not saying we&#039;re amazon.com, but they charge a 15% commission on every item plus a flat $1.25 and I think ebay charges something like 13% if you take into account all of their fees.<br /><br />So, my proposal is to run an experiment. We&#039;ve been tracking sales data very closely for months and we&#039;re showing fairly steady linear growth. What I&#039;d like to do is double the commission rate to 12.5% for 1 month and see how sales respond to this. If our rate of growth slows, or even shrinks, then at least we&#039;ll know that it is too much and can scale it back, but if it doesn&#039;t affect sales, then we&#039;ll have doubled our revenue without any major consequence and can start investing in some of our &quot;back-burner&quot; projects such as internationalizing the site, developing an api, possibly starting an insurance pool, and getting normal updates and features online faster.<br /><br />This change will begin in 3 days unless I hear an overwhelming number of you respond negatively against it. Thanks for your time and for making Silk Road great :)<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff<br /><br />

				Silk Road is not Amazon or eBay, and does not trade yet at even close to the volumes of those two, a rational economist would not compare them this way.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />A double increase in commission will only stall the long term market growth for both Silk Road buyers and sellers.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />

				Im just a newbie here but I think some of SR&#039;s points are valuable and worth considering.&nbsp; I would like to hear more about the insurance pool, that *could* increase buyer confidence considerably... depending on the details of implementation.<br /><br />Increasing server availability internationally, security and performace is great idea but I dont see that justifying a double rate increase.<br /><br />I think a slowly graduated increase based on improvment of services is the right middle ground with feedback along the way adjusting for the rate of growth/nongrowth...<br /><br />Just arbitrarily picking a number out by comparison to megaconglomerate light years ahead services is perhaps inappropriate altogether though.<br /><br />Show me a definate plan, give me a hard number and a projected completion date before the next increase is considered and I&#039;ll be quite agreeable if it sounds fiesable.<br /><br />Paperchasin&#039;

				silk road has to eat too. <br /><br />they are concerned about sale decreases, as long as it&#039;s not notable then it&#039;s a win. buyers and sellers are getting hit left and right with fees. the cost of doing business anonymously. <br /><br />when is too much? hopefully they wont test that barrier

				I&#039;d have to say this is bullshit, and straight greedy. 5% was generous enough for just operating the site, not that I&#039;m not thankful for that, but that takes next to zero legal risk. Thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins are spent on SR daily, and if SR can&#039;t run the site on 5% of that AND have money for himself, I think he&#039;s doing something wrong.

				I&#039;m with Nomad here. Doubling the fee is just too much. If it goes to anything above 10% I feel like the buyers and sellers will revolt or leave. I don&#039;t see that much of an increase being necessary or prudent. A slight increase to achieve the goals laid out in the PM might be acceptable but until we are seeing the volumes of an amazon or ebay doubling it just isn&#039;t justified imo. From 1% to 5% to 6.25% to 12.5% in a few months is just too high of an increase. Sellers would have to lower their prices to keep their current customers happy or force buyers to pay more thereby decreasing sales. Either way it seems like a bad idea.

				This reasoning looks highly flawed to me — there is no valid reason to strip the buyers from their bitcoins, especially since this is NOT a free move. It&#039;d result in an obviously lower volume of sales.<br /><br />Also, one has to keep in mind here that SR&#039;s interest and the seller&#039;s here is not the same. For x2 move in commission, as long as the volume of sales doesn&#039;t half, SR is still better off. In the end, buyers and sellers would pay the cost of this change, and if I can&#039;t imagine why one&#039;d think of this as positive, I certainly can imagine how this idea came to SR&#039;s mind. It&#039;s just like taxation: as long as the marginal rate is low enough, there&#039;s a strong incentive to raise it. But up to which point?<br /><br />Moreover, it&#039;d produce a strong incentive to fork the marketplace and/or to move to other channels (out of escrow, return to F2F dealing) which would be highly detrimental to SR&#039;s business. It&#039;s better to have 6% of commission and a 90+% market share and 12% and a &lt;45% market share.<br /><br />And it makes all of us angry to have to waste time with this. The cost in terms of good will here is already sunk.

				I think 12.5 is a bit steep, especially since there are constantly popping up threads like this exploit fixed and that bug found...<br />If they really go through with 12.5%, I expect A LOT more features, more redundant servers and proper and regular pentesting to ensure security.<br /><br />Personally I would like to see a model where the current commission is standard, but with the option for sellers to donate like 5% to SR and receive something like a badge for that next to their names in listings and such.<br />

				LOL tight arsed bitches. ^^^<br />The only way to see if it will work is to give this fee a run for a month. I think SR are being very generous and make this a trial.<br /><br />Its not like this fee is going to come out of the vendors profit ::) It is going to come out of the buyers pocket, and if the customer is willing to keep buying your product then the fee is fair.<br /><br />its on par with other online fees ffs. <br /><br />perhaps to make yourself feel better about yourself and your prices you could add it to your item description so customers know full well what&#039; is what..<br />big bag o buds&nbsp; - 80btc<br />postage and handling - 4btc<br />SR fee - 10.5 btc<br />Total - 94.5 btc<br /><br />You get what you pay for, and if this fee means better/quicker implementation of features and security, then FUCK YEAH<br /><br />

				SR is entitled to charge what they deem fair. The question they have to ask is whether the service they provide to sellers is worth it for them. Obviously buyers get great protection out of SR escrow but is it worth it to sellers to be charged 12%, have their money in escrow til transactions are completed and have to use only Bitcoin to accept payments.<br /><br />I am not sure it is.<br /><br />This sort of thing really squeezes the margins on the smaller items ( which most items are on SR ) and you may see a mass exodus of sellers as Nomad has suggested.

				12.5% is way too much and will drive sellers elsewhere or skirt the escrow system.&nbsp; Sellers already get whacked with the fluctuating bitcoin exchange rate, escrow fees, and the occasional scam buyer that it just may not be worth their time to deal with an additional cost on top of it all.&nbsp; If you want to raise the rates, then fine, raise it 1 or 2 percent and make it permanent.&nbsp; I has a feeling that doubling the commission is not going to increase SR income, it will just reduce number of vendors and items available and the income in the end for SR will remain about the same as it is now.

				How keynsian. Sellers will end up lowering prices, so this amounts to a tax. I highly doubt there is a single buyer who has ever thought &#039;hm, if only sellers had to pay more taxes on their items, I might be more willing to trust them&#039;; apart from sellers I doubt many of the buyers know or care about the SR fee at all.

				Here&#039;s my initial problem...<br /><br />Amazon and Ebay offer prices LOWER than what you would get at a store. So they can charge outrageous fees because at the end of the day, you are saving money as a buyer.<br /><br />But SilkRoad has products that are typically far more expensive then you would get f2f. If fees increase, it just makes this expense even higher, less economical, and makes it more likely that someone will buy their goods elsewhere or just go out of escrow with trusted vendors.<br /><br />Finally, Amazon and Ebay dont give the buyer or seller any kind of currency risk. SR, with the use of fluctuating (and volatile) bit coins, does. And while it&#039;s possible for a seller to hedge their coins, its not possibly for a buyer to do the same thing with anything in his SR wallet.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t think doubling the fee is a smart move. If you have to, increase it slowly.

				This appears to be a sales tax, something to be passed on to the customer...and while I understand your reasoning, it is quite a bit higher than I&#039;d be willing to pay...I only have to pay 8% sales tax at a local store, and nothing at online outlets like Amazon.<br /><br />I think the current rates are fair, but with a doubling of the rate I believe dealers would all start offering out-of-escrow sales, and scamming would increase...dropping sales and your revenue.

				I&#039;m not feeling it.....this isn&#039;t something Silk Road should compare to Amazon or eBay. Sure we shop like this was eBay or Amazon, but that doesnt<br /><br />mean we should follow their business model. Silk Road is unique in that it does NOT follow these business models.<br /><br />While I support the idea of an Insurance Pool, or possible API improvements, I don&#039;t think after all this time Silk Road is broke.<br /><br />This will make sellers drop like flies, revenue will remain the same or even worse - decrease. You can&#039;t propose such a steep increase so fast.<br /><br />Personally I feel it is a statement against freedom and what Silk Road stands for; to conform to a centralized example like Amazon/eBay.<br /><br />The spike in commission during the time when the BTC is so god damn low, is going to hurt us very badly. Out of escrow sales will go awry.<br /><br />As a seller I am going to close up shop by 2012 - if this goes into effect. This is especially inconvenient since I&#039;ve just invested a large amount of<br /><br />capital in new products, and had planned on making this a good holiday season for everyone. Now I&#039;ve got to figure out how to make just EVEN.<br /><br /><br />L75

				12.5 is too much. Already paying a premium on the stuff that i buy on SR but i dont mind it since SR offers anonymity and security. But at 12.5 i would rather go out of escrow with one of the more trusted sellers here.<br /><br />IMHO the fee would be justified if SR was stressed with traffic and there were a ton of buyers (thousands of transactions per day) but thats not the case, so for the time being this fee increase is premature.

				I like SR, I like the way it works, the anonymity and the ubiquity of the products, I really appreciate it all. But, the prices for most stuff on SR are already very high in comparison to what you have to pay on the &quot;free market&quot;, so the only solutions I see for myself, in case of the pay-fee increase, is to go without SR, for example by contacting the sellers I trust directly, what I will definitely do.<br />&nbsp;

				It would be far better for SR to not do this.&nbsp; Vendors will stop selling because it will mean less buyers willing to pay the increase.&nbsp; Is a vendor going to stay when their sales drop by half or more because buyers no longer want to pay? I doubt it.&nbsp; One thing that SR may not understand is that a vendor may only be making a 10% profit on an item they sell and by increasing the fees that high will make it not worth their while.&nbsp; Less vendors and less buyers means zero profit increase for SR.

				I purposely do not sell out of escrow because I think that SR deserves his cut. I think this could change if the increase is implemented. Also, according to their own words, they have been incrementally going up month after moth with the 6.23 percent. If it gets raised, i bet my last bigcoin that number will go down. If it aiint broke, don&#039;t fix it....<br /><br />Things are going good right now. If sales are going up each month, then let it ride. I see nothing but problems if you start charging more. 1. Vendors will go outside of escrow (especially the trusted ones) 2. vendors will try to sell outside of SR, like OVDB and other places.. I say, leave well enough alone. and in 6 months you will be able to buy your mansion.....<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t like the comparison to Amazon and Ebay either. When Ebay stated, I believe that that it was entirely a bid system and the percentage was quite low. The reason the prices of Amazon and Ebay have gone up so much is that they are so popular and make so much money. Also, If you start charging prices that are getting closer to 20 percent. you will start seeing regular customers working side deals with their reguar vendors and cutting SR totally out of the loop. I see this as a huge step back for SR.... I was kind of upset with they raised to 6.23 percent, but hey, no big deal. but when I see it double, whats next month? tripple? where&#039;s the end?

				Judging by the thread so far, the one almost universal agreement is that it will leave a bad taste in the sellers&#039; collective mouths. Sellers may jump ship at the first viable opportunity; I&#039;m sure some are imagining Daddy Fat Sacks picking out diamond pinky rings when they see 100% rate increases.<br /><br />Spitballing here:<br /><br />-Sliding scale commission- highest for new sellers/small amounts, lowest for long term/larger amounts<br />--Reliable Sellers with a good rep are like gold- new sellers- who knows? Give the new sellers something to work towards.<br />--12.5% of a 5$ digital good is a lot easier to swallow than 12.5% of 2800$ Unicorn Horn<br /><br />-Increase Seller account fee- gradually (or make it all auction based, then you can shorten and lengthen the auction to influence price)<br />-- it&#039;s one time, so sellers won&#039;t be reminded of it every sale they make.<br /><br />-Just raise it gradually, like every other company :) <br /><br />-Keep it under 10% - That&#039;s a huge psychological barrier<br /><br />-Want it over 10%? - split it up, like a cell phone bill; airplane or concert ticket.<br /><br />-Make it temporary, and specific- eg &#039;SR is fundraising for servers&#039; then use a cheesy thermometer graphic or something (no numbers) so everyone can see it fill up, then the fee goes away. <br /><br />-In addition to fees, fluctuations, etc, sellers are also losing entire packages to shady buyers/mailmen/customs officials, etc. The SR commission is just one of many money drains.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m all for SR increasing their revenue in order to keep the site secure, safe, and bring new features -- I definitely understand that it takes capital to grow and expand.<br /><br />SR, have you considered an alternate source of revenue such as charging those who benefit from new features (or other ways in general?).&nbsp; For instance, people may very well be willing to pay towards an insurance pool.<br /><br />In general, I think there may be a better way of increasing revenue than through an increased sales tax -- at least at this stage.&nbsp; If anything, I think you should try to promote exponential growth for a bit before you start capping it to linear or sublinear growth.

				I don&#039;t think the price increase is unreasonable considering the service it provides, although I would like to see more aggressive maintenance and updates.&nbsp; It might even inspire some much needed competition and make the free market less centralized and dependent on a single site. I honestly doubt that sales would drop too much until someone offers an equal service at a better price. SR is still very unique and there are plenty of people (myself included) who will fork over the extra change (albeit begrudgingly as this thread poignantly illustrates).

				Simple economic theory would suggest the lower the prices the more sales will be had. More sales = more cut for SR. No probs. They are running a business not a charity. I do however think that 12.5% is a psychological barrier which will be detrimental to the amount of trade.<br />Stick it at 7.5%. Make the statement this will be the case for the next 6-12 months or whatever and review it then. If trade has increased no need to raise it - if trade has decreased perhaps a downwards adjustment would be nescessary. If it has remained stagnant perhaps a 1% increase would be warranted.

				You can draw comparisons between this issue and the one Netflix recently faced. They dominated the market for streaming video and DVD rentals. They raised their prices by 100% and lost 1 million customers. Without the revenue from customers they are losing content providers because they cannot offer the $$ needed to retain them ( Starz recently ).<br /><br />You raise fees and force sellers to raise prices they are going to lose customers and if they arent getting the volume of customers they need then there is really minimal benefits to listing on SR. Raising fees that dramatically will put too great of a strain on sellers that already have to deal with BTC fluctuations and BTC cash out costs as is. Greenmachines illustration of a $100 sale equating to around $70 in pocket is bang on.<br /><br />Comparisons to eBay and Amazon are not exactly fair as other posters have pointed out. Amazon is the largest online shopping site in the world, SR is a niche trading site in an underground economy. eBay for instance raised their fees on Buy it Now auctions but at the same time lowered fees on normal auctions to get buyers back to their auctions style service which was the intention of the site in the first place. SR was initially setup as a BTC only escrow site but has slowly deviated away from that for some listings. Perhaps if new fees are needed a wider range of services could be taxed. Let trusted sellers offer LR or Pecunix for a higher % or let them offer group buy listings or charge them a slightly higher fee when they have buyers release funds before delivery. Just spitballing here.<br /><br />It would seem to ask more of sellers you would need to offer more to them.<br /><br />

				Another user here who was thinking of becoming a seller, but this would probably stop me.&nbsp; :(<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t really see the point to this.&nbsp; I definitely want SR to get paid for all his work, but with all the sales that happen on this site ever day, I&#039;m surprised the 6% would not be enough.&nbsp; Especially since it is all going one place - another reason I don&#039;t really like the ebay/amazon comparison is those are huge companies paying the salaries of hundreds if not thousands of employees.<br /><br /><br />In the long run I don&#039;t even really see this generating more revenue for SR.&nbsp; If sales are increasing steadily now, just leave it be.&nbsp; More sales = more revenue.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t see how this could not effect the growth of sales.&nbsp; It increases the cost to buyers, lowers a seller&#039;s cut, or both, and that is going to make doing business elsewhere or out of escrow more appealing.<br /><br /><br />It also just doesn&#039;t seem very considerate of the sellers.&nbsp; I&#039;m very impressed with the effort most sellers on this site put forward, the care they have for their customers, etc. and I think they should be commended.&nbsp; This just kind of seems like a slap in the face to sellers from SR, who makes no money without them and their services.<br /><br /><br />Personally I would really like to be a part of SR, not just to make money.&nbsp; I love everything this site stands for, and the system in place.&nbsp; It is a great forum to reach out and provide a service to people, BUT it also has to be worthwhile financially at the end of the day.&nbsp; There is already so much that sellers have to go through to make this profitable, especially newer ones just starting up, and I think this is going to put a lot of them off.&nbsp; I know it is at least making me reconsider whether it is worth it to do business here.. even if it isn&#039;t THAT huge of a final paycut, it kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth the way SR is going about this.&nbsp;

				SR needs their cut, that&#039;s definite. I think the main concern I would have as a buyer is what that cut is and how it effects the price I pay. So just throwing my 2 cents out there, but I think 10% would have to be the absolute upper limit.<br /><br />Some countries have a GST (Goods and Services Tax) set at about this, and it seems to work, so if we think about it in the same way it&#039;s not the worst idea. BUT I&#039;m already holding off making purchases as nothing I&#039;m interested in as at the right price right now. Adding to the price for me would make me think even more before making a purchase, which means some good vendors, and SR, would really be missing out in the long run.

				Like most others I am dead against a rise of this much. In fact, in my opinion, raising the commission will probably have the opposite effect to that is intended.<br /><br />Both buyers &amp; sellers already have to deal with various fees and charges to even be able to participate on SR (fees for buying and selling bitcoins, fluctuating btc values, commisions from exchanges, etc.)<br /><br />In fact, I actually felt sorry for a vendor I recently bought from because by the time I received the product they had probably lost about 40% - 50% of the initial order total.<br /><br />If there has to be some form of restructuring of the fee schedule then I think it should give sellers an incentive to stay here on SR and have their consistency rewarded and not penalising them for being successful.<br /><br />The idea I am about to describe has been used in many large bricks &amp; mortar stores and online shops.<br /><br />Sellers should all start off at a basic level and depending on their sales &amp; feedback (and other factors) be able to move up a level when certain criteria is met.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />Level 1 (Bronze) - Initial starting point (8% fee)<br />Level 2 (Silver)&nbsp; - Maybe made more than 10 successful sales (6% fee)<br />Level 3 (Gold) - Maybe more than 30 sales (4% fee)<br />Level 4 (Platinum) - More than 50 sales (2% fee)<br /><br />Obviously those figures are just pulled out of my hat and more issues/situations would need to be thought about (eg: a seller&#039;s feedback rating should play a big part).<br /><br />But as you can see my theory actually rewards prolific and successful sellers and not penalises them. The more sales the more commission for SR. Simple!<br />

				Prices are already high here .... $60+ for an eight of weed, $100+ for a gram of coke, etc. Extra commission will only raise prices for the buyers. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get greedy SR. If it&#039;s working, why ruin a good thing? <br /><br />Look what happened with Netflix. They raised their fees and people bailed because they felt slighted. <br /><br />Bad idea.

				What makes me wonder is why these messages were not PGP signed with SRs key. I sent a message asking for him to send that message, signed, but have yet to get a reply.<br /><br />I feel the impression in the thread that SR might have upset many. SR is being courteous as it is their site, they can change the rules however they want - yet they are asking what the vendors think... they haven&#039;t increased the commissions yet. So if we look at the situation objectively, SR is still &quot;green&quot;. <br /><br />Again, from an objective point of view, vendors are not directly affected - unless transaction volume actually decreases. If the commission is higher, we just raise our prices and profit the same. Now if these prices happen to decrease the volume, then the we are affected. What SR is asking is for a test run to see if it actually affects the volume. <br /><br />I vote for very small increase in commissions. I also vote for some distribution of these commissions to the community, e.g. the administrators of the forum. Eventually we can have some system where the most helpful users receive a pot every week/month. This should motivate people to be kind and helpful in the forums :) This is however from a sellers point of view. It would be interesting to see a poll where buyers got to respond, &quot;would you still buy as much if the prices increased x%?&quot;

				its nice sounding that it is only used when the customer gets the product, but many people will just send pm&#039;s to vendors they trust and instead pay them an extra 12% for more more product, or try to get a 12% discount.&nbsp; It will jack up prices for vendors and lead people to just find good vendors and by pass the system completely(leaving SR with 0%).&nbsp; Like someone said with netflicks, when people feel they are being over charged they will try to cheat the system.&nbsp; I think the current system is working but I do not know all of the costs associated with running this site.&nbsp; It i a good service and people are willing to pay for it.&nbsp; I am down for whatever needs to happen to ensure we are all safe and business continues as usual

				Hogwash!<br /><br />I have always been a strong advocate of using the escrow system not only for safety reasons but because it is fair that SR should be compensated for their efforts. Without them, this wouldn&#039;t be possible. But bloody hell 12.5%!? If you really want anyone to support this, why not explain exactly why on earth you need to double your commission? If there is a logical reason that stands the test of fairness then you have my support. As it stands right now, raising it to 12.5% is outrageous. <br /><br />Regardless of whether or not your revenue drops, you will have lost the good will of customers and sellers. Out-of-escrow transactions will increase by a large amount. This increase in out-of-escrow transactions will give scammers more of an incentive to buy an account and scam. The world will probably come to an end.. perhaps?<br /><br />Consider your other options:<br />Charge a 6.25% + $1.50 base fee<br />Charge 8.25% (on everything up to $200) + $1.50 base fee. This will give people a reason to buy and sell larger quantities! <br /><br />Please reconsider this increase and let the members help you decide. If you (SR) create a poll in this forum with various options as to increasing your commission and let the members vote, at least you will have SOME people on your side.

				Yes, I&#039;m aware that the increase will not take place. I&#039;m pointing out that all his messages should be signed, not just the ones on the forum. Using the logic you used before we could say he didn&#039;t need to sign messages on the forum either because we can see they are posted by Silk_Road. The point of signing the message in both places is in case him or his account is compromised in some way.<br /><br />You&#039;re right about there being no good reason for LE to say the fee was increasing, other than maybe to create discontent.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t really a vendor only issue either, buyers will be the ones that end up paying for any increase in commission, so I would say it&#039;s a buyer and seller issue.<br /><br />I&#039;m also not just talking about this thread, he&#039;s been absent in the thread about security vulnerabilities too, and he should definitely be talking about that.

				I agree with you to some extent. Signing message is like signing docs in reality. It should be avoided.<br />There is no security breach in SR. No site is perfect and there is always something what can be made better and more safe.<br />But in this area/bussines less info reagarding specifics published by anyone what we can not confirm and on speculate is better then more published data.<br />I do not know who that member is..neither do you. How we can know really what that is all about? All what we need to know is that all issues/bug will be fixed imidatelly.<br />But to publish that info here before issue were solved really disturb me.<br />Signing pm was advice when sr was down (this forum was not exist) and only info about news were on other places all over internet.<br /><br />As about is this a vendor or sellers issue I was only saying what SR did. He informed vendors because this place offer service to them and vendor pay that service.<br />Fact is buyer pay really that or not is irelevant.

				No, I don&#039;t know who that person is, but I do think they are right. In my experience (and I do have some) if a website hasn&#039;t secured against the basics they haven&#039;t secured against more advanced attacks either. So while I can&#039;t be absolutely certain that there are other problems, I would bet all my money on it. Knowing that bugs will be fixed immediately (after SR finds out about them) isn&#039;t enough for me because by that time it can be too late. I&#039;d like to know that there is a developer working on it that knows about security. I know all sites have problems, but these particular problems shouldn&#039;t be had anymore, they&#039;re just too basic.<br /><br />As far as I know he did wait until the issues were fixed to say what they were, if he didn&#039;t that&#039;s really not OK.

				We do understand SR&#039;s idea of increasing the revenue to promote the growth even faster, but we do have to say that the increase is relatively steep in such a short time. We will be on the same line with SR on this and keep up doing our best to provide our clients needs. Though our vision would be more like to ask an extra % for several services, like insurance, escrow and so on. 5% for escrow, 5% extra for insurance and such, as an example of course. Anyhow we will see how it goes.<br /><br />Regards,<br />sesampino

				Hi,<br /><br />Older members who are here more then 3 months have the right get the buyers account for free because they deserve the credits that silkroad exist.<br /><br />What is 2 bitcoins fee ($ 10) for to join an exclusive anonymous site like this.In other branches if you want an exclusive service you must pay a fee for it (Disco,Airlines,Creditcards,Rotary Clubs..etc).The Site Silkroad is an Exclusieve Service not more and not less.<br /><br />Example:<br />If i go to an Disco i must pay entry at the door to buy drinks or other stuff (security,wc) and this how i see it.<br /><br />People are already pissed off the high vendor prices on silkroad.Most Vendors calculated there prices for the shipment/refund/scammers risks and silkroad fee&#039;s here at silkroad.<br /><br />If a buyer see that the item listed product become lower/cheaper then they happy will pay for the 2 bitcoins fee ($ 10) once.<br /><br />Yes i got Manny times scammed (Rate scammed is 1/5 here on silkroad) with customer who claim they didn&#039;t get the product so they hope for a 50% / 100% refund or resend.<br />My shipment stealth is one of the best you can get here on silkroad no doubt about it (check my feedback).<br />Other is that they really let you wait for finishing the transaction and that pisses of also the vendors here.<br /><br /><br />Bottom of line is if this idea get accepted i lower my price with minimal 15 % or more.<br /><br />In one line the Vendors get the hits here and not the buyers.<br /><br />Greets DutchShop,<br />

				LAZY and GREEDY<br /><br />if SR wants more money then increase number of transactions (i.e. customers &amp; sellers) not commission.<br /><br />5% is more than enough for a basic un-hedged transaction.<br /><br />but if sr does increase commission, i think that a number of competitor sites would open (and those that exist increase in market share), so every cloud has a silver lining ;)<br /><br />--fruity

				of you provide the possibility to agree on a refund percentage before going into escrow, provide an API to the interface so we can stop overloading the server and use our own sofware fo rlabelling and order processing, would help the load on the servers as well as the profitability of vendors due to better integrated backend software.

				I have been a buyer for some time, thinking of selling. I read thru a bunch of the comments posted, and I have to agree that the instant hike is the wrong &quot;road&quot; to go down. I think a gradual trial increase is more realistic. As thinking about becoming a seller, doing some math, the margin with the new rate makes it nearly a wash. (I know it is intrinsicly related to the product on how much markup can be tolerated, but being a little guy, I couldn&#039;t push the volumes the big guys do). I hate to say it, but with that kind of %, I can&#039;t compete realistically, let alone profit to make it work the work/risk. SR needs to grow, and to do so needs to have new sellers/wares to be sold. It&#039;s a cycle that will continue, but we need to keep a fine balance. If new sellers don&#039;t sign up, then where does the growth come from?<br /><br />I know SR needs to fund itself, expand, secure, and evolve, but an instant double increase seems a little extreme. Reading the comments from others, I think the message is being sent. SR does, just like every big site out there, has to evolve. The advantage SR holds, is that the community as a whole should provide input to steer it in the right direction. <br /><br />Hopefully the community will provide a loud enough voice to be heard on this!
