				I’m keeping my SR username off the forums for now, so what you see here does not match my vendor user name. <br /><br />I want to give a candid review from a rookie vendor (130+ transactions) relating my experiences with buyers here on Silk Road. Out of my 130 plus transactions, only two have gone to resolution.&nbsp; And one was due to a shipping extension for international delivery.&nbsp; I’ve had one buyer claim they never received a shipment when I’m pretty sure they did.&nbsp; I sent them more product free of charge, giving the buyer the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Perhaps they never did receive it?<br /><br />So far so good.&nbsp; I’m impressed with the escrow system, and I’m impressed with the Silk Road community.<br /><br />Here’s to free markets.<br />

				Nice! I&#039;m a newish buyer here with 3 transactions of ฿18.01 total and I have fallen in love with SR! All 3 of my transactions went off smoothly and I&#039;m just pretty amazed with the system here.<br /><br />It&#039;s great to hear a vendors perspective and I hope you have many more successful sales here :) It seems like SR has a great community (except for the occasional scammer/bad buyer or vendor) and I hope it stays this way.

				I think the vendors perspective depends on the product they sell. I see people who sell addictive drugs such as Heroin or Meth have a lot of problems with buyer scammers. but sellers who deal with drugs such as psychedelics, weed, and MDMA dont have as many of these problems. im glad to hear that you enjoy it and its nice to hear about how many honest buyers there are here :)

				Why dont you want to post your SR user name?<br /><br />Nothing you have said would get anyone offside. In fact its all positive and a good opportunity for a little advertising.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dicko

				Glad some of the scammers are fucking off now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a buyer here for over a year, purchased everything from weed to heroin and never even had to go to the resolution center.&nbsp; We&#039;re talking 30-40 orders, all of which got to me in good condition, in a timely manner and products all were legit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve probably used 20 different vendors.&nbsp; I think that shows the great quality vendors we have here on SR.

The process is in resolution right now, for the vendor to post under his normal account means that the person he is dealing with could look it up on the board. This in and of itself could weekend a negotiating position. <br /><br />There are other reasons, sometimes we as vendors worry about what people will think of a post like that. Especially new vendors who are still getting their feet under them so to speak.<br /><br />
