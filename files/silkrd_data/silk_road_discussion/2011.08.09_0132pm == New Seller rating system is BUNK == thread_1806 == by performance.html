My very first sale, the buyer gave me a 4/5 because they didn&#039;t actually try the product first. He came to the forum and apologized. Silk Road never changed the feedback.<br /><br />This other seller completed his first sale 11 days ago, while I completed mine 30 days ago.<br /><br />Why should he get a 100, rank 66, while I get a 99 rank 130? I&#039;ve been around three times longer and I have double the sales. My only glitch is a single 4/5.<br /><br />This fucking blows!<br />

				I don&#039;t think they should publish your position. The percentage is all that you need (along with the number of transactions) but you do have a point. I think they should bag &quot;your are number 2 out of 180 vendors&quot; Its very misleading...

				Hey, all that matters is I think you are&nbsp; &nbsp;G R E A T&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I was noticing the same thing.<br />One has to check the ratings, length of time, comments, and last of all this FORUM.<br /><br />The whole rating systems needs improvement, we need a buyer rating system as well.<br />You guys take these ratings way to serious, and I guess you should.<br />I am more worried why the scammers don&#039;t show up quickly enough?<br />IE, coast2coast

				Guys, all things will get better in time - the new system has it&#039;s flaws no doubt but the site is constantly moving forward. Sucks when your trying your hardest and an automated system shits on ya - hopefully things will get fixed soon.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Ah, I see it was fixed. Are these ratings only re-calculated periodically? This happened after I&#039;d been in vacation mode for a few days and came out of it

				#138 out of 188 sellers with 97.9% positive feedback from 36 transactions<br /><br />I was like #50 or something but then I got a troll feedback out of nowhere giving me 1/5 with no explanation as to the reason...<br /><br />If they&#039;re going to publish a ranking I think it should be more weighted towards how long you&#039;ve been around and how pleased the average<br />person is. Having it change so drastically based on one single feedback that it seems you can&#039;t get taken down gives too much incentive for<br />rival sellers to perhaps fuck with your feedback on purpose.<br /><br />That said does this ranking actually serve any purpose other than vanity? Like do higher ranked people get their stuff featured higher or is it purely down to feedback?

				The higher your ranking the higher you are listed - or at least that is what I have observed. <br />And yea - the fact that one troll feedback can fuck with damn near any vendor is a SERIOUS flaw. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				+1 on the hating the new rating system.&nbsp; The more I deal with it, the more I hate it.&nbsp; I know the old feedback system wasn&#039;t perfect, but it was better than this.&nbsp; And it&#039;s especially going to screw smaller sellers.

				I like the new system better, but it has some issues.<br />LexiSadie is still at 100.0% after a 2/5 and a 4/5 rating.<br />(LexiSadie is a respected seller and is highly rated, I am just noting an error in the system)

				Age and Number of sales should definitely be weighted heavier. Especially since buyers have eBay extortion at their fingertips...
