				The prices of these products in bitcoins are what I can get on the streets in USD, so the fact that it takes over $4.00 USD to buy one bitcoin means the prices are 4x what you normally pay. No? How are these considered good deals? Now if these prices were the same but in USD then these deals would be great. Example.... 20.00 bitcoins for 1 gram of coke = $80.00 USD. R u kidding me? Am I missing something?

SR prices suck on every single thing being sold. At least in my area everything is considerably less money than on SR. However, for the hard to find drugs its worth paying SR since otherwise they wouldn&#039;t be available. SR is good for Ketamine, LSD, and molly but its foolish to purchase meth, coke, heroin, or pain pills. Basically all the hard drugs are very high priced. I also disagree with the guy that said stuff on SR is purer than stuff on the street. Some sellers on SR sell good shit but some sell trash. I don&#039;t order many kinds of drugs from SR but I know more than 1 person that chooses to buy from SR and sometimes they do get weak shit. But the strong shit in my area is always sold by dangerous individuals in bad areas so some people are not able to enter these areas and the weak shit from SR is an acceptable alternative.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I cant believe what im reading! Are you serious? You&#039;re not only paying for convenience, but quality is the most important factor. If someone has garbage product, it will be reflected in their feedback and on the forum. <br /><br />It is in nobodys best interest to sell shit, you may get lucky and get 1 sale, but with quality you&#039;ll have hoards.<br /><br />I know that the Opiates are pretty high, but take into account that in areas such as say Oklahoma where Oxycodone is rare and $1+/mg or not available at all, SR offers product and service that may not be available, hence the cost.<br /><br />If you get such good quality and pricing, why don&#039;t you put your $ where your mouth is and pick up some weight and list it up. Then we&#039;ll see how good your connects are.

				I&#039;ve found that the best vendors raise or lower their bitcoin prices so it more accurately reflects the same USD amount, give or take. Eg, a 1/4 oz. may be $100 (amount is just for illustrative purposes) but on a 3bc to $1 rate it may be 33bc while when it&#039;s a 4bc to $1 rate it may be 25bc. Again, more or less. If I can get an oz. of some interesting strain of medical or maybe hash (that I would never even come close to in my circles and where I live) for around $350-400/oz. - and often less - that&#039;s not too bad, all things considered.

I know that the coke is cheaper and pills cleaner. Weed is cheaper in (bulk- where the fuck else could a random citizen get some fire buds delivered to his door (2days) for only 230 a zip?)

				Yes, if you live in a decently populated area the prices you can find on the street are going to be better than the ones you can find online 99% of the time.&nbsp; However, there&#039;s a certain level of convenience and security from online transaction that you cannot get from face-to-face deals that you as a consumer are paying for.&nbsp; There is a much bigger burden on the side of the seller when dealing online.&nbsp; Consider that even selling totally innocuous items over ebay in any kind of volume can be a hassle.&nbsp; Now compound that with the fact that the people here are dealing with illegal substances.&nbsp; Most people who can acquire the kinds of quantities it takes to be vending have the connections, resources, and probably the previous experience to deal IRL, so if someone is going to go through the trouble to move any kind of volume through the mail they&#039;re going to make it worth their while.&nbsp; Not only does a vendor have the basic cost of their product to cover, they&#039;ve now got shipping and site fees to add to their overhead costs (and this isn&#039;t taking into account the time spent actually packaging and shipping orders).&nbsp; When you take these things into consideration the prices here don&#039;t seem as ludicrous.

				I live in the UK and that adds a further complication wrt exchange rates of Sterling v USD.&nbsp; The rate at the mo is pretty standard (£1 =~$1.5), but last time I went to the States it was much closer to 1:1.<br /><br />Anyway, wrt to prices - they do seem a lot higher, but my thinking is that this is for a better purity when it comes to coke as the UK coke purity seems to have dropped at the level I get it.<br /><br />For me - I would rather pay more for better - everyday, that&#039;s why I have come here.&nbsp; Though I haven;t made any orders yet, so yet to prove the benefit to myself.

				I can get much better weed and H here than locally. It depends on what you want. Some drugs like the research chemicals aren&#039;t easy to find and aren&#039;t that expensive. <br /><br />Location makes all the difference. Someone on SR was talking about grams of ice in Australia going for $800.&nbsp; Far from big cities prices can easily be double or triple and the product is often more cut. Wumg00&#039;s and Nucleos&#039;s dope is cheap if you buy 5 or 10 grams.<br />If you order in bulk the prices aren&#039;t as bad. Some vendors will work with you on prices if you message them and have the money to spend.

				Not everyone has access to someone on the streets with the drug your looking for (eg. lets say you have anxiety like me and have a hard enough time dealing with weed dealers that ... coke dealers would just be panic attack).<br /><br />$80/g c is the normal street price where I am (I may not have access, but I know it&#039;s cost), grat&#039;s to you for living in a region where you can get c for cheaper.&nbsp; Sadly your region doesn&#039;t represent the entire global black market demographic.<br /><br />People come here because of the:<br /><br />1. Safety/Anonymyity/etc.<br />2. Quality/Purity/Identity <br />3. To find &#039;exotic&#039; drugs (wherein exotic means they live in a region where the drug isn&#039;t common.&nbsp; Believe it or not there are places where you can&#039;t find weed anywhere .. so they have to come here)<br />4. The cost to them (in their region of the world) may be close to or even cheaper then the street price in their region <br />5. The CORE members are GOOD people, they want to HELP and not rob you in the darkness of an alley. Many will go far beyond their requirements to try and help other buyers/vendors.&nbsp; If for nothing else, you should buy off of SR for the communities contributions

				I agree the prices are high (90% too high, IMO).&nbsp; I think quality is about the same from what I can get from the street.<br /><br />.....however.....<br /><br />This is a consistent source, and the odds of me being incarcerated are lower.&nbsp; Furthermore, can you honestly say that you have ever bought a gram from the street and it actually weighed a gram?&nbsp; I mean, if it weighs out to 0.9, you just paid an extra 10%.&nbsp; 0.8, and you paid 20% extra.<br /><br />Also, the way these guys are packaging this stuff up, it&#039;s professional equipment and it takes time.&nbsp; Toss in the cost the vendor pays to SR, the vendor account cost, the escrow service that both buyer and seller receive, the actual shipping cost, and the times a vendor chooses to re-ship the same order at a complete loss.&nbsp; How about the stick-it-to-the-man economy you&#039;re supporting?<br /><br />Is the mark up really too high?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Feels like it sometimes.&nbsp; But sometimes it does seem fair.

				I see you guys point and I understand now that you&#039;ve explained it in detail. But I guess what I&#039;m looking for is a better connect than what&#039;s around here.

Also lbs (16 oz) of weed here sell for $1,000 USD, then the person breaks them down to ounces and sell them for $100-$125 to make his profit. I am looking to buy here and resell in the streets.

				Aside from the fact that selling on SR is far, far riskier and more work than on the street, it comes down to supply and demand. If there are 3 guys selling coke, they dictate the price. Like the real world, price goes up as availability goes down. If there are 3 guys all selling coke at $80/gram (which is not an awful price depending on the purity of it), there is no motivation for them to drop the price until someone else comes along offering a better deal. That said, the prices here for common drugs (weed specifically) are vastly more sensible than they have been in the past, presumably prices will drop as SR continues to grow.

Not unless the street is ripping you off. But to some of us it&#039;s still worth the price obviously or it wouldn&#039;t sell at that price. Supply and demand, folks.
