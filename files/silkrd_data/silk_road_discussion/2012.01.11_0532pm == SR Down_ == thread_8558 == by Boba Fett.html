				At the risk of sounding like I&#039;m bitching, I have to say, I wish SR warned/gave advanced notice for things like this.&nbsp; People run business around this website and IMO it is very unprofessional to have it go down like this with no warning.&nbsp; I understand this is an underground market so I have to set my expectations accordingly, but that doesn&#039;t mean you should leave people hanging like this with no accountability.

				I can sympathize with both sides of this issue - If they expected down time to be just a minute or two, why go through the trouble of alerting people? problems arise and it takes longer than anticipated.... yeah, oops.<br /><br />though members are for the most part a group of people not known for their patience! ;)<br /><br />meh, whatcha gonna do? complaining won&#039;t fix it. ;)

You can log into a server with the intention of making one minor change, and have the issue somehow spiral out of control and fuck up all your shit. I&#039;d say 99% of the time, it would be impossible to forewarn your userbase of downtime. If Silkroad was able to warn us every single time his servers were about to go down, that would make him a computer science genius, and he&#039;d be capable of making millions of dollars doing other projects and wouldn&#039;t need to bother with this drug trading shit.<br />
