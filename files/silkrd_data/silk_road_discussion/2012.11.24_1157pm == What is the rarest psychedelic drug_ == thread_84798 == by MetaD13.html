				Just wondering since I just read about a drug called bromo-dragonfly that is extremely strong and basically unheard of. I&#039;ve never seen anything about this drug until now and I always thought I knew about all the weird and unknown shit. <br /><br />So, if you are aware of any other ultra-rare psychs then please list them as well as their effects!

				well the only thing i cant find on the road here within the u.s. at least is mescaline so that s my answer. i think the frog shroomeister is talking about is the Bufo Alvarious frog or the Colorodo River Frog. it produces dmt/poison in glands on its cheek. you can milk the glands and try it on a piece of glass and smoke it because the flame destroys the poison. but there are easier ways to get dmt. i have made it myself from mimosa hostilis root bark. its actually pretty easy you make sure you pay attention and be careful. unless there is another frog he is talking about that i dont know of. the only frog i know of that will do anything just from licking is like the poison dart from or something, and that kills or paralyzes. but im not an expert just a burnout that loves tripping so i have looked a few things up but not everything by far

				I think it&#039;s just a plot device in Fear and Loathing. He needed some rare drug that is a description of the madness of the adventure itself. Hunter always had a flair for the exotic. Have you ever heard of the Ibogaine Effect? <br /><br />In 1972, journalist Hunter S. Thompson accused Democratic candidate Edmund Muskie of being addicted to ibogaine in a satirical piece while covering the Wisconsin primaries of the 1972 U.S. Presidential primaries for Rolling Stone magazine. Many readers, and even other journalists, did not realize that Thompson&#039;s assertion was facetious. The claim was completely unfounded, and Thompson himself is documented in the movie Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson discussing the self-fabricated joke of Muskie&#039;s alleged ibogaine use and his surprise that anyone actually believed the claim. The original piece appeared in a slightly different form in Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#039;72.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/adrenochrome/adrenochrome.shtml

DOM is pretty difficult to find these days. and then there&#039;s all sorts of new chemicals that havent even really been synthed yet, so i guess they are pretty rare too. i just noticed 3c-e for sale on here, i was impressed

				Bromo-dragonfly is a horrible psychedelic RC, and commonly sold around my area as LSD. It has over 24+hours effects and a terrible body load, which makes it a terrifying experience.<br /><br />And as for the rarest drug.. Probably the frog, datura and pretty much mescaline. never bumped into any of that..

In seconds I was burning from the Inside and regretted allowing him to give me a medicine I know nothing about. I began to sweat. My blood began to race. My heart pounded. I became acutely aware of every vein and artery in my body and could feel them opening to allow for the fantastic pulse of my blood. My stomach cramped and I vomited violently. I lost control of my bodily functions and began to urinate and defecate. I fell to the ground. Then, unexpectedly, I found myself growling and moving about on all fours. I felt as though animals were passing through me, trying to express themselves through my body. It was a fantastic feeling but it passed quickly, and I could think of nothing but the rushing of my blood, a sensation so intense that I thought my heart would burst. The rushing got faster and faster. I was in agony. I gasped for breath. Slowly, the pounding became steady and rhythmic, and when it finally subsided altogether. I was overcome with exhaustion, I slept where I was. When I awoke a few hours later, I heard voices. But as I came to my senses.. I realized I was alone. I looked around and saw that I had been washed off and put into My hammock. I stood and walked to the edge of the hut&#039;s unwalled platform floor and realized that the conversation I was over hearing was between two of Pablo&#039;s wives who were standing nearly 20 yards away. I didn&#039;t understand their dialect, of course, but I was surprised to even hear them from that distance. I walked to the other side of the platform and looked out into the jungle; its noises, too, were clearer than usual.<br /><br />And it wasn&#039;t just my hearing that had been improved. My vision, my sense of smell, everything about me felt larger than life, and my body felt immensely strong: That evening I explained what was feeling with hand gestures as much as language. Pablo smiled. &quot;Bi-ram-bo sapo.&quot; he said, &quot;fuerte.&quot; It was good sapo. Strong.<br /><br />During the next few days, my feeling of strength didn&#039;t diminish; I could go whole days without being hungry or thirsty and move through the jungle for hours without tiring Every sense I possessed was heightened and in tune with the environment, as though the sapo put the rhythm of the jungle into my blood.<br /><br />I asked Pablo about sapo&#039;s uses and discovered there were several. Among hunters; it was used both to sharpen the senses and as a way to increase stamina during long hunts when carrying food and water was difficult. In large doses, it could make a Matses hunter &quot;invisible&quot; to poor-sighted but acute smelling jungle animals by temporarily eliminating their human odor. As a medicine, sapo also had multiple uses, serving as a tonic to cleanse and strengthen the body and as a toxin purge for those with the grippe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Mescaline and Datura aren&#039;t rare seeing as the cacti and datura are fairly easy to grow, it&#039;s just hard to find anyone selling it. As far as rareness goes it just depends on who and where you are and now with online drugs it&#039;s just what isn&#039;t being synthed. As far as common psychedelics go though I would say Ibogaine.

He needed some rare drug that is a description of the madness of the adventure itself. Hunter always had a flair for the exotic. Have you ever heard of the Ibogaine Effect? <br /><br />In 1972, journalist Hunter S. Thompson accused Democratic candidate Edmund Muskie of being addicted to ibogaine in a satirical piece while covering the Wisconsin primaries of the 1972 U.S. Presidential primaries for Rolling Stone magazine. Many readers, and even other journalists, did not realize that Thompson&#039;s assertion was facetious. The claim was completely unfounded, and Thompson himself is documented in the movie Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson discussing the self-fabricated joke of Muskie&#039;s alleged ibogaine use and his surprise that anyone actually believed the claim. The original piece appeared in a slightly different form in Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#039;72.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/adrenochrome/adrenochrome.shtml<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, I would have to agree; Ibogaine is a drug usually found in South America and Africa. It&#039;s usually done in tribal ceremonies. Shamans have a particular way of guiding the ibogaine trip so your childhood flashbacks don&#039;t get too intense. It&#039;s not supposed to be the funnest drug, it&#039;s supposed to act as a cure for those opiate dependent persons. <br />What Ibogaine essentially does during its 12 hour trip is bring you into a state of acute shock from who you&#039;ve been and where youre going in life of course. This is why it usually scares people into wanting to do heroin again because of the emotions Ibogaine catalyzes and the way it works subtly but surely on the re-allignment of your neurons. Like if they were too close together from taking too much cocaine or speed or MDMA the Ibogaine actually seperates these neurons in a small way.<br />And it&#039;s rare because it&#039;s not a real Ibogain trip unless you do it in a ceremonial conforatable group setting in the Amazon or some place similar...
