				So, I believe I have been burned by 18kct. I also might have been burned by another vendor who I went out of escrow with. I got burned because I did not listen. I was stubborn and way too trusting and I fucked myself. $1000 gone and another $800 possibly gone as well. The worst part is I knew better. I have been in the weed business for many years IRL and I know the ins and outs. I have become accustomed to working with extremely dependable people and have become complacent. I released funds early to 2 extremely awesome vendors with success on large orders both times so I retardedly figured every one was trustworthy. If I would have listened to Nomad, not released funds early, and stayed inside of escrow I would still have my $1800. To all newbies....do as your told. Dont learn the hard way like me!!!!! Better yet, do what you know is right!!!!!! Trust noone!

				I&#039;m sorry that happened, and can happen to any one of us.&nbsp; I do release funds to sellers I trust in another area, and even on the streets we can get burnt, but I try to give slack if they have a good reputation, and I&#039;ve dealt with them before....but I also know without a shadow of a doubt, that if I *do* get burnt, there isn&#039;t a damn thing I can do about it.&nbsp; The other thing is, is that this site was designed, with escrow, so sellers who don&#039;t like it--and I understand the reasons--probably won&#039;t do well here anyway.&nbsp; Like others, I sometimes lift escrow early, for sellers who&#039;ve done me right, and are well known, but it&#039;s kind of getting away from what site was designed to do, which is protect us from each other...<br /><br />So far, I&#039;ve not gotten burnt, tho one seller I lifted escrow on, on second buy, didn&#039;t deliver for quite a few others...but she did me right....<br /><br />Again, I hope it&#039;s just a misunderstanding, and the sellers makes your purchase right...they gain a lot more in the long run by doing so.

				heh, 1800 is a lot, luckily I only got scammed by 18kct with $100&nbsp; - I would only trust buying from a moderator in here or perhaps mitanox or acidfriedmybrain which I know sells legit products (bought 50 tabs from acidfriedmybrain and 6 from mitanox) - fast delivery (faster than normal ebay shippings) and the real deal.

				There are a few vendors who demand that funds are released early for orders over a certain amount or based on whether the order is domestic or international.&nbsp; I came across one of those vendors recently and told him that as I had never dealt with him before, my first order is small and that I&#039;d like to use the full escrow features of the site.&nbsp; The vendor agreed and the transaction is progressing.<br /><br />If you are using a vendor for the first time, don&#039;t listen to anyone&#039;s opinions, place a low value order first and complete it fully within escrow.&nbsp; If the vendor refuses to let you do this, then report him via this forum.

				im sorry for your lose, his monday madness lsd deal did seem too good to be true, I only have done out of escrow 3 times with two different vendors who are very good (mdma only)&nbsp; I never get anything more than $150 though because not only is there a risk of getting scammed, but if it gets lost in the mail im also screwed.&nbsp; So out of escrow u gotta just expect the worst but hope for the best.&nbsp; it is high time i get some lsd for the first time in my life, and som vendors are working inside escrow :D
