Federal prosecutors charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, according to a court filing.

				GOTMILK, how do you become a vendor on Sheep&#039;s Market? I don&#039;t see the option after I&#039;ve created my account.<br /><br />Or do I need BTC and I need to make it a vendor account from the start?

				I have questions.&nbsp; 1.) Do we think that LE is going to be going through every order to find people to arrest, or is the info really deleted from the servers after it&#039;s executed?&nbsp; 2.) For the orders in progress, which haven&#039;t been finalized, that means we could receive our order but the vendor won&#039;t get his money?&nbsp; 3.) Will they even bother with just buyers who have kept it to a few orders for personal use, even though the mail thing is a federal crime?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to know more about exactly how the SR servers were programmed to operate, like what exactly happened to all of our info after an order has been finalized.

				Yea I thought it was a joke at first like many others but I&#039;m afraid it is not as all the major news headlines are gawking about this. They did the same thing to libertyreserve.<br />There are copies of court documents already posted so it seems legit. If it is indeed a hoax then it will be a global scale and attract more negative attention, however it would actually be a wakeup call to all of us to increase security.<br /><br />Apparently from what I&#039;ve read DPR was busted by ordering several fake ID&#039;s to an address and had his picture on them. But who knows the truth anymore.

I&#039;ve never ever stored money in my SR wallet, but I just happened to leave around $85 dollars in it because I was waiting for a vendor to come back from vacation. Anyone that had any coins on the site, whether vendors or buyers, is shit out of luck.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216390.msg1581931#msg1581931">Quote from: AnastasiaWest on October 02, 2013, 06:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.) Will they even bother with just buyers who have kept it to a few orders for personal use, even though the mail thing is a federal crime?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to know more about exactly how the SR servers were programmed to operate, like what exactly happened to all of our info after an order has been finalized.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Probably not; they&#039;re more interested in stopping the distribution then they are in going after small time, personal use buyers. <br /><br />Info is supposed to be deleted after the vendor marks it as shipped, but I&#039;m not sure how that works. Hopefully another vendor can explain that.

				I dont know what to think honestly something in my head doesnt add up.<br /><br />I feel like all this information about the raid, uncovering who this dpr was, then court documents being released all in&nbsp; a matter of a&nbsp; few hours seems to convient. If I was the FBI DEA etc etc, I would want to keep every piece of information under wraps for as long as I could not just allow all this information to get leaked out in less than 3 hours.<br /><br />I&#039;m not convinced it was a full seizure though all the signs clearly point to that but I&#039;m on&nbsp; a conspiracy theorist by nature. <br /><br />I think it hasnt really sunk in and I wont really believe until at least 2 weeks has passed. <br /><br /><br />PS never try and hire a hitman...it just fucks your shit up. <br /><br />

				Here&#039;s something that should surprise no one:<br /><br />&quot;FBI and other federal agents first tapped into the site in November 2011 and have made more than 100 undercover purchases of controlled substances, including ecstasy, cocaine, heroin and LSD, on the network. The drugs came from vendors located in the United States and at least 10 other countries, court papers say. Agents also purchased hacking services, including malicious software such as password stealing programs, the court papers say.&quot;<br />http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/02/fbi-shuts-down-silk-road-website/2909023/<br /><br />I knew that was happening; I never thought it started that early. The site was only a few months old then.

				They had complete control of the overseas server, so I would assume they&#039;ve been monitoring all kinds of shit for a very very long time.
