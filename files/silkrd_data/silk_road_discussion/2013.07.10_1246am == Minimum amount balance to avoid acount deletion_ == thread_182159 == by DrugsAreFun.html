				From the Wiki:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Will my account be deleted for inactivity?<br /><br />Accounts with zero balance will be archived if not logged into for several months. If you suspect your account has been archived, try creating a new user with the same name. If you cannot, then the account still exists. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I finally got around to installing bitcoin-qt again and I would like to move the majority of my coins to local storage.&nbsp; Reason being that I also bought some coins from Coinbase during the dip (got them for around $71) and I&#039;m planning on holding on to them hoping their value will go up and I&#039;ll make a little profit selling them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always had at least a little bit of coin in my account and I don&#039;t mind leaving a couple bucks worth on there to keep my account active in case I don&#039;t log in for a while.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a ton of transactions but I do have 0% auto-finalize and 0% refund so I would hate to lose that.

				I had .0001 BTC in an account and it didn&#039;t get deleted after 6 or 7 months. When they say zero, I think they mean zero, so you should be able to leave a little bitdust in there to keep it active, but don&#039;t quote me on that.<br />

				I imagine this is to cut down the accounts that are created, but never used once. So as long as you have *anything* in there, it shows you&#039;re at least marginally active.

				Some of us ditch old buyer accounts as not to accumulate millions of dollars worth of transaction history on one account. lol&nbsp; - It&#039;s comforting to know that a few of mine are long gone. :P
