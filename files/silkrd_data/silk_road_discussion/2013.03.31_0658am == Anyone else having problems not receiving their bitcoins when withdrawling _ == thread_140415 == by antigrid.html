				*Edit* Of course I have been waiting 7-8 hours and the second after I submit this thread my money shows up. But still curious as to why it took so long and if anyone else was having the same issues?<br /><br />I am starting to get worried, I used the withdrawl option on one SR account to send it to another, which I have done many many times before and recently. But it has never taken anywhere close to this long. It still is not showing up and starting to worry now. I always double check the address to make sure I don&#039;t accidentally hit a key or something so that is not the issue.<br /><br />Anyone else having issues? Really frustrating as I only have until tomorrow morning to order a custom listing that a vendor created for me and it&#039;s already been 7-8 hours.

				If you haven&#039;t received them in 12 hours from sending them, then you&#039;ll need to contact SR Support on the main site.
