				Mine are all accounted for.&nbsp; DPR did say that deposits and withdrawals weren&#039;t being processed yet, but would all be settled once that piece is back up and running.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; Until DPR says that everything is 100%, your deposits and withdrawals won&#039;t be processed.&nbsp; Check out the stickied &quot;update&quot; thread.<br /><br />If your coins are still missing after the all-clear, then you can worry.

				It might very well be in the server&#039;s backlog, there&#039;s a LOT of money freeing up right now. If it isn&#039;t then it might be in the blockchain which also needs a while to process all the fresh money. If it doesn&#039;t show up in the next couple of days to a week contact DPR. I lost money in the previous outage and when that didn&#039;t show up he fixed it without any problems. Be patient though, it might take a few days.

				Relax, guys.&nbsp; It seems pretty apparent to me that DPR had to reprovision Silkroad onto a new server.&nbsp; If this happened, then Silkroad has to redownload the entire bitcoin blockchain over TOR, and this would take awhile.&nbsp; Once the blockchain is downloaded the bitcoins you purchased will magically show up in your account.

				Usually it takes anywhere between a few hours to a few days. If you desperately need to place orders I suggest reloading. It might take a couple of days for them to turn up, or they might go missing. I&#039;ve lost coin before during outages, some turned up some haven&#039;t. The only official update regarding bitcoins has been posted below. Truely lost bitcoins have been refunded by SR in the past, but given the scale of the problem I don&#039;t know if that&#039;ll be the policy this time.<br /><br />&quot;UPDATE (2355 UTC): Deposits are working.&nbsp; All outstanding deposits have been processed, and future deposits will be processed as usual.&nbsp; If you sent a deposit before or during the outage and your account has not been credited, message support so we can investigate your issue.&nbsp; Some withdrawals have been processed, but there is still a queue we are working through.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update when withdrawals are back to normal.&quot; - DPR on &quot;update&quot; thread

				I am having the same problem to, I deposited a small amount of btc&#039;s the day the site crashed and signed on today only to find an empty balance.&nbsp; What DPR&#039;s &quot;Update&quot; thread makes it out to sound like, is all deposits before the outage should be cleared by now.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">UPDATE (2355 UTC): Deposits are working.&nbsp; All outstanding deposits have been processed, and future deposits will be processed as usual.&nbsp; If you sent a deposit before or during the outage and your account has not been credited, message support so we can investigate your issue.&nbsp; Some withdrawals have been processed, but there is still a queue we are working through.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update when withdrawals are back to normal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am guessing if you made a deposit and can prove it, but the deposit doesn&#039;t show up in your account, that you will get the coins eventually, you might have to contact support though.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did notice that my SR BTC address in the blockchain has been telling me these past few days that it has the amount I sent to SR the day of the outage as the final amount, until earlier today.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really pay close attention to the blockchain, but I went into the graph view and it showed that my past transactions came and went within the same day. This most recent one that was sent the day of the outage (Friday I believe) did not clear the same day like the past transactions, but today around the time DPR made that announcement.&nbsp; Makes me think my coins are on there way.&nbsp; Either way I am just glad that SR is back up and will be able to buy something tomorrow for sure&nbsp; ;D<br />

				And now some guy is saying this is all a scam on another post. I really wish DPR or somebody official from SR inform us all on exactly what is going on with the btc transferred when things went down. I mean this site is the best and worst thing in my life but fuck me i find their lack of information about other people&#039;s money alarming and disrespectful. <br />If anybody that didn&#039;t get their btc while sr was inactive but have since received can you please update so the rest of us can see some kind of progression and hope that there is just a queue/backlog situation?<br /><br />

				I have emailed confirmation of sent btc from supplier to customer support. granted it was only a few hours ago but no reply. Hence i have entered this forum and sort out individuals who are in a similar boat as me. It would be great to get some sort of confirmation from SR as to how/if or when those btc will appear. I say great but really it should just be professional curtsey. <br />I really think your &quot;mass chaos&quot; accusations belong on a different thread to different posters to the ones on here.

				I agree Kortney, I don&#039;t normally post, but my intention is certainly not to cause mass chaos. I am just curious what other people are experiencing so that I can know if there really is just a long delay till&nbsp; my BTCs appear. I contacted SR support like DPR recommended if we happened to deposit BTC the day of the crash and didn&#039;t receive them, and the response I got was really not helpfull.... They just said that withdrawals and deposits were temporarily suspended and would be back up soon, but we aren&#039;t talking about making a purchase or depositing MORE btcs....I just want info on the ones I already paid for days ago!

				So i understand that people can now add and withdraw btc from their sr wallets. But has anybody that added btc while the crash happened received their btc? I still have NOT. SR has sent a message saying sit tight. I have, so what the fuck is going on? Has anybody got their coins from that period? Are we who were unlucky enough to send btc just before the crash fucked? Can sr come forward and admit this rather then asking us to site here with your dick in our hands waiting on replys that don&#039;y come? <br />

				Long time buyer on the road, and long time lurker on the forums. <br /><br />I registered only now (after all the apocalyptic hoopla thats been floating around) only to add my experience so far to the list. I also made a deposit right before SR went&nbsp; down, and yesterday during the brief uptime was told by SR Support to &quot;hang in there&quot;. Logging in now I have sent another query to SR Support because my deposit has yet to land in my wallet.<br /><br />If DPR Addresses this in his next update I&#039;d be thrilled, just keeping my fingers crossed at this point.

				I also have not received mine kortney. It&#039;s really hard for me to not sound like I&#039;m freaking out, but I put all I could afford into BTC right before the crash, so I can&#039;t even put more money in to make any purchase at all. I was very much relying on those BTC, and hoped they might&#039;ve showed up by today....I&#039;ve really tried to be patient through all this, but my patience is starting to run out. I can&#039;t even get a helpful response from SR administration....in fact it seems that everyone is getting the same automated response....so yes if ANYONE happened to deposit BTC right before the crash and has recently gotten their BTC, PLEASE let us know!

				I&#039;d like to confirm that the same thing has happened to me, and I&#039;ve just sent sr support a message.<br /><br />I sent 32 bitcoins 5 - 6 hours ago and it still hasn&#039;t appeared even though the block explorer confirms that the transaction went through.

				Best not to jump to conclusions. At this point, it an open mystery, better to diagnose and solve the problem than jumping to conjecture. I&#039;m still mystified at how apparently I sent my entire bitcoin wallet of 32.0995, and then it sent my 0.0995 back. Doesn&#039;t seem to make any sense when looking at the block explorer. It still says received instead of sent though, which might be good.<br /><br />EDIT: block explorer says that my 32 btc are &quot;not yet redeemed&quot; this is good news right?

				nobody should worry about transferring btc&#039;s to their sr wallet now that it&#039;s up and running. Waiting 6 hours or whatever don&#039;t worry it will come. The problem is the poor souls who transferred around the 9/10th nov. I am in this boat and have still not received those coins. However i have transferred some today and no worries business as usual. But has anybody received their btc from those few days around the crash? NO! We haven&#039;t. <br />So feel free to operate as normal but SR and DPR what will be happening to us who are out of pocket, (loyal, grateful) customers that lost money during that window of mass confusion?<br />

When I looked last night (14hrs ago) there was 11 confirmations and wasn&#039;t verified yet and now it seems to have finished and has 103 confirmations and it verified.

				Seems like the people who are missing their bitcoins on the 9th are far more common that people like me who deposited last night and still haven&#039;t seen their bitcoins. I haven&#039;t received anything from sr support 24 hours later, still sitting tight though. I know this is an issue that can be resolved. It has to be resolved, if even one person loses their bitcoins for good by simply depositing, then that&#039;s a grave concern. I&#039;ll wait and see how it goes, it&#039;s very possibly that DPR has changed hands, I read the Princess Bride the other day, and it makes a lot of sense if that&#039;s the case, and they&#039;d never tell us too. <br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />A pirate of near-mythical reputation, The Dread Pirate Roberts is feared across the seven seas for his ruthlessness and swordfighting prowess, and is well known for taking no prisoners.<br /><br />It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who periodically pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor. Everyone except the successor and the former Roberts is then released at a convenient port, and a new crew is hired. The former Roberts stays aboard as first mate, referring to his successor as &quot;Captain Roberts&quot;, and thereby establishing the new Roberts&#039; persona. After the crew is convinced, the former Roberts leaves the ship and retires on his earnings.<br /><br />Westley, the hero of The Princess Bride, is on a voyage to seek his fortune when his ship is captured by the Dread Pirate; the ship is massacred, and Westley is reported dead.[2] While the other passengers are weeping and offering bribery for their lives, Westley simply asks Roberts to please not kill him. The &quot;please&quot; arousing his interest, Roberts asks, &quot;Why should I make an exception of you?&quot; Westley then explains his mission to get enough money to reunite with his true love, Buttercup. Westley&#039;s description of Buttercup&#039;s beauty moves Roberts to the point that he hires Westley as a personal attendant. While Roberts is impressed with Westley&#039;s work, he continues to keep Westley&#039;s future in doubt by saying each night &quot;Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I&#039;ll most likely kill you in the morning.&quot; After about three years, Roberts and Westley have grown close, and Roberts promotes Westley to his second-in-command. Shortly after that, Roberts reveals to Westley that the guise of the &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; is merely a nom de guerre that he has inherited. Westley goes on to explain that the method works because Roberts&#039; notorious reputation inspires overwhelming fear in sailors. Ships immediately capitulate and surrender their wealth rather than be captured, a fate they imagine to be certain death. A pirate operating under his own name is said to be incapable of such infamy: &quot;No one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.&quot; [3]<br /><br />The fear inspired by the title is used in Westley&#039;s plan of invading the castle right before Buttercup&#039;s wedding. In the invasion the giant Fezzik poses as Roberts to inspire fear in the castle guard. The fear is amplified by Fezzik&#039;s size and a few more tricks, and it made the entire guard run away so that the invaders could enter with nearly no resistance.<br /><br />Kinda cool how they&#039;ve used this pseudonym in my opinion, he&#039;s (they&#039;re) definitely more intelligent that 90% of this forum. <br /><br />I have faith that I&#039;ll get my bitcoins, but I&#039;m just damn impatient lol.

Mostly everyone seems to be able to get their funds online, but some either can&#039;t or are being delayed extraordinarily, since the deposits really should take no more than 4 hours. There&#039;s been a backlash though, as some forum members don&#039;t believe that we genuinely have a problem with deposits, and some members who have problems with depositing who are going absolutely insane right now, making erroneous and far-fetched claims.<br /><br />It would be nice if support got back to me at some point though.

				I, Gompert, also received that same automated message. It is very upsetting that in DPR&#039;s update he asked all of us who have not yet received our bitcoins to contact support so they could figure it out, but all of us just get that same stupid message....I really do believe we are just getting strung along because he knows nothing can be done and we are all out whatever we tried to deposit on the 9th....

				So for the two posters above, did you resend the btcs from the 9/10th to a new address and that worked? If so please how does this work???, for somebody who worked in a supermarket and spent 2 mins trying to scan the divider between a pair of shoppers, groceries. Dam you fancy dividers!!!!<br />Or is it that you sent btcs in the last 48 hours and like they worked? Which is no surprise as things are back to normal EXCEPT for those who sent btcs on the 9/10th nov. I am so sorry for sounding like a broken record but no one gives a fuck about transfers now that the site is up and running it&#039;s all about when it crashed. Are we getting raped in the arse and&nbsp; if so will SR confirm if the used a condom or not? It&#039;s the least they&nbsp; could do. The right thing would be toFIX what is obviously a major concern to many loyal, invested customers/vendors.<br />and by fix i mean don&#039;t completely allows us to be RIPPED OFF!<br /><br /><br /><br />

I haven&#039;t given up hope and stayed as positive as I could despite all the fear mongering and negativity in the forums.. overall, it was great to be a part of this chaotic experience.. haha<br /><br />few questions<br /><br />did you contact support and get the reply everyone has been getting about waiting for their servers to handle load?<br /><br />also, did you run your SR bitcoin address in blockchain.info and did it show as your deposits being sent to other addresses recently?<br /><br />I just want to have hope that all of us will be on the same boat.. thanks for the heads up!

				This is not good enough! At least man up and give bad news if that&#039;s what it is. Especially when you are, admittedly unintentionally, the cause of&nbsp; us being out of pocket. It&#039;s not stealing but fuck me they go over every case when it comes to a discretionary between a vendor and a customer. Now i didn&#039;t put my coins threw a tumbler or any democratic spin machine i just sent it to me SR wallet and they are the reason why it&#039;s not there!<br />How can i fight this? How can they be so richesse with how people conduct business on their site, at a their profit, yet be so vacant and disrespectful with loyal paying customers? I mean they dont even read emails or acknowledge proof that btcs were sent to our <br />sr wallet while this unexplainable.....crash occurred. I have been fucked over many times when it comes to purchasing or selling drugs. I think we all have. But none have left such a foul taste from a connection i have been so faithful too. (nah i havee been fucked over plenty good)<br />At least that was from street scum and not what is pretended here. Let me guess, no reply, no support, no update, no care factor. DPR, whoever, you are&nbsp; so cool manning up with fucking people over. <br /><br />&nbsp;

You guys have no idea, you act like I&#039;m saying this to be a cunt, when it&#039;s the fucking opposite you idiots there&#039;s people who know shit you don&#039;t and you guys don&#039;t think of it from all angles. WTF do you think I haven&#039;t been banned as you would love so much. You&#039;re like Creationists arguing with an Evolutionist, I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA or MI-5.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago. <br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same becase DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort which is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are,not just me<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpols World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian assange revealed how much info governments share, ou PM freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking slar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide t o abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all might stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />Ciao... whinging bitches&nbsp; :P<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forrest and runing into trees of all things from hallucinating too hard.<br /><br />This smells like BACON and soon to be broken EGGS!

The Sr Support guys are inundated ATM, I thought we&#039;d been had for days because of SR&#039;s incompetence because they&#039;re usually very punctual etc, but now I know it&#039;s DPR who handles the purse strings, the other guys are essentially mods for the site.

I don&#039;t know a bunch about bitcoins and how they are moved around but it quite obviously shows a big red arrow going from my SR wallet account to two other accounts that I don&#039;t recognize.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71854.msg603567#msg603567">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on November 18, 2012, 05:16 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Contact him directly on here and he&#039;ll sort it out. Just be short and to the point. The Sr Support guys are inundated ATM, I thought we&#039;d been had for days because of SR&#039;s incompetence because they&#039;re usually very punctual etc, but now I know it&#039;s DPR who handles the purse strings, the other guys are essentially mods for the site. CHILLAX, you will get them. I was missing 150BTC which I dare say is more than you deposited, and I talked with DPR himself last night. I will say though it took about three or four messages for him to respond which one sentence a week ago would have been at least a little courteous when you&#039;ve got $2k of someones money they trusted you with. Just my opinion because it&#039;s what I would do and you could imagine how I felt with people getting 2BTC missing payments and 9BTC, meanwhile I&#039;m going WTF I replied to the staff instantly etc they should have processed it. It wasn&#039;t until DPR FINALLY showed up and gave a State Of The Road Address the penny dropped why the staff couldn&#039;t do the payments, he won&#039;t let them. Strange, if it were my employees I would have trust in them to manage the accounts and then have an accountant mate, or relative, to the sheets at the end of the month, but then this ain&#039;t a regular business. Hope this helps...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71854.msg602944#msg602944">Quote from: gompert on November 18, 2012, 01:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So far my BTC I deposited on 11/9 haven&#039;t hit my account.

				You&#039;ve got to realise, he&#039;s got 1000&#039;s to process and cross check individually by himself and TBH, I would already have mine if it weren&#039;t for the fact I&#039;m locked out of my account ATM, so once I get a new password I&#039;ll message him and he&#039;ll wire them.<br /><br />Believe me, I UNDERSTAND your frustration, and if you like there&#039;s threads to reflect your opinions on the downtime etc.<br /><br />It really is DPR running the purse strings so rest assured you will be paid mate, but yes, waiting sucks especially without answers to your questions.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71854.msg603817#msg603817">Quote from: strangemagic on November 18, 2012, 07:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71854.msg602560#msg602560">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on November 17, 2012, 08:59 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">RELAX... <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Unbelievable.<br />I&#039;ve been waiting for this almost as long as JWM has been waiting for his coins, and now is that all? <br />IDK, guess I was expecting something different.
