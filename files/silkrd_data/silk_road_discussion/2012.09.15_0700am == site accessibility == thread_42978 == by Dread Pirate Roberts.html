				Some of you may have noticed we closed the site for maintenance a little over 24 hours ago.&nbsp; The changes we made were an attempt improve accessibility to the site (fewer timeouts and dropped connections).&nbsp; If you noticed a substantial improvement, please vote yes.&nbsp; If you were having problems before and they still persist, please vote no.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t really been paying attention, please don&#039;t vote, or vote for the 3rd option.<br /><br />Thanks!

I guess it&#039;s an improvement yeah. Tho you guys should do something about vendor percentage ratings don&#039;t think they&#039;re very accurate at the moment. Seems like the math is off on a lot of em.

				Yer, these past 24 hours have been great. I&#039;ve logged-on first time, every time in the past 24 hours. Which, for me, is a huge improvement as it was often taking ten to twenty minutes of changing my identity and retrying every few minutes. Let&#039;s hope it stays like this...<br /><br />Thanks DPR.

				Yeah, it used to take me about 20minutes to connect to SR. The forums were the same. Since the maintenance I haven&#039;t had one connection error and its without a doubt much quicker. <br />Thanks SR &amp; DPR.

				I&#039;ve noticed the forums are faster/more consistent as well.&nbsp; Anyone else agree or is it like the time I got a new windshield and my car just seemed to run better?

				awesome, looks like a strong consensus so far.&nbsp; there is no reason the forums should be faster, so that might just be placebo effect ;)

				SR itself is WAY more responsive since the maintenance. Tor finds a circuit within one minute,&nbsp; and I haven&#039;t experienced a single dropped connection. The session problems that caused repeated logins also seem to be gone.<br /><br />It takes a bit longer to build circuits to the forums, but the difference is negligible. I only had one or two timeouts which were resolved with the &quot;new identity&quot; function.<br /><br />Thanks DPR!!! The site is now a pleasure to use again. We shall toast to your continued success tonight as we dine on some of the road&#039;s finest product.

				I cannot access silk road at all from my laptop, or any dot onion for that matter despite the fact that when tor browser opens it says im configured to browse tor. However, i can access silk road from my tiny, hand-held touch device.via torbot+tor browser and the device is a MAJOR inconvenience. Any idea why i cant access it from tor browser on my computer??

				it is running 100x better now, i was getting fails and drops left right and center, now it never drops and connects first time so think it worked, i wonder what was causing it, we did quite some digging trying to find a way around it. the maintenance was a great success if you want to read what we found out and how to use StrictExit&nbsp; nodes i have put the price really low come and have a look.
