				I think that you might being ddos&#039;ing your own server :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on and off all day, no problems. Just wait awhile, hit &quot;use new identity&quot; on tor, and try again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever logged in the first time I tried. Always takes 2 or 3 tries.

				Having issues also. Trying to implement our 20% valentines day sale but can&#039;t update listings. And don&#039;t want to post about sale on fourm before listings are updated. <br /><br />Have been hitting new identity on Tor but no joy. Either LEO trying a DDOS, or just too many trying to get on.

				Whole TOR has been slow those last one or two days. Probably under attack of some sort, overload, or&nbsp; technical fault. It&#039;s not limited to sr and its forum, which were both working today and yesterday and still are if you are patient and keep changing ID/routes until you find a working one/
