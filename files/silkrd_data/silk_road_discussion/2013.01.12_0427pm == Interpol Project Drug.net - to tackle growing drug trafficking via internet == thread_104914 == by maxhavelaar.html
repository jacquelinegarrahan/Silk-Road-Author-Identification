				Interpol has been in charge of coordinating operations against online drug trafficking for quite a long time. A lot of their focus is certainly on spam pharmacies. There are some people who consider themselves specialists in terms of combating the drug forums as well though, one of the agents who arrested enelysion self identified himself to the court as a world leading expert regarding the drug forum communities. I don&#039;t think that their specialists are very special though. Ongoing operations are operations that have not concluded yet. I could take that to mean two different things, it could mean operations such as Pangaea, which is on going in that it is carried out on an annual basis, or it could mean on going as in the single time operation has not concluded with arrests yet. I have heard on going operation used to mean either of these things.

				gotta echo everyone else here - I was doing work for my masters a year ago and got to email with a few Interpol agents [full disclosure, my work is in human trafficking, not drugs] and I can tell you that when I delicately brought up the drugs conversation, they both kind of cyber-groaned, rolled their eyes and changed the subject. <br /><br />sounds like hot air indeed.
