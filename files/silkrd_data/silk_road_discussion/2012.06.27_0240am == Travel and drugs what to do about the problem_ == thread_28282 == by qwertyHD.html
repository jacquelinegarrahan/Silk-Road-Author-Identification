				Hello fellow SR travelers,<br /><br />Today i wanted to talk about and get some ideas for myself and probably a lot of other people wondering the same questions, So here is.<br /><br />It goes something like this, <br />Your going overseas on holidays for a while &quot;im going for a month&quot; and whilst u are hitting up some decent clubs or raves w/e, some of the time its a right pain in the arse to get good gear, especially if you cant speak a fucking word of their language &quot;German / polish for me&quot;.<br /><br />So what would be the best way to go about solving the problem, I was thinking trying to get a PO box if even possible located in one of the city&#039;s i am going to, problems will be translation / ID.<br /><br />Anyone else got some tips,<br />

				Stay at a half-decent hotel under a fake name and get your drugs sent to the front desk reception under your fake assumed check in name......just watch your back for the sting and you&#039;ll be alright.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get greedy now, shipping in small quantities is the key!

				Post it when bending over.<br /><br />My buddy always does this.<br /><br />He got an half oz of hash and some MDMA up there.<br /><br />In jail its well known some guys can carry a mobile phone up their ass.<br /><br />You would be amazed what sione people can get up there.<br /><br />Posting it might work if the vendor is based in that continent.

				It all depends on what you are traveling with.&nbsp; Things like weed and hash I would say leave at home.&nbsp; Too easy to get caught with that shit.&nbsp; And don&#039;t try stuffing anything down your shorts.&nbsp; These days with the body scanners your chances of getting through are not worth the risk.<br /><br />I have no problem traveling with things like pills.&nbsp; I usually keep some older prescription bottles around for some stuff, and for others I go to the drug store and find a vitamin bottle that has pills that are similar and use that.&nbsp; I&#039;ll put the pills in among the regular pills and pack them with my regular luggage.&nbsp; Never had a problem.&nbsp; But I also don&#039;t travel with huge quantities.&nbsp; Getting one bottle of pills through is no big deal, trying to get several is asking for trouble.<br /><br />Back before they started with all the body scanners and increased security I used to use one of those cigarette making machines (the ones that stuff the tobacco into an empty filtered cigarette and I would put some weed in the first part then cover it up with regular tobacco.&nbsp; I&#039;d make a dozen or so and carry them on in my regular cigarette pack.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I would want to try it these days.<br /><br />For blotters just cut them up and put some in your wallet with your other cards, insurance papers and stuff. You can put it in the scanner without worry, it just looks like a wallet.<br /><br />But honestly the best option is if you know someone where you are going and can either send ahead or meet them and buy something there without getting popped.

				yup, small quantities.&nbsp; I once flew from USA to Vienna with layover in Munich, with 2g of weed, and then flew the same route back with half g.&nbsp; On the way back, when I was picking up my luggage, the dogs walked right by my case, sniffed it, and moved on.&nbsp; They might have been bomb dogs not mj dogs, but either way, if you keep it inconspicuous, it won&#039;t be found.&nbsp; mine was, like jojo, in a pill bottle, with pills covering it.<br /><br />and blotters can almost be put anywhere without being detected.&nbsp; Wallet is a good idea.&nbsp; I cut mine into strips and put them snugly into a certain page of a book.&nbsp; I forgot the page when I went to remove them, and spent like 45 minutes trying to find the damn things--they were really tight into the binding (I ended up remembering the page, and spent 5 minutes trying to remove them).<br /><br />with powders, you can bag them up and flatten the fuck out of them.&nbsp; make them square and put them in between two other flat items.&nbsp; again, jojos wallet idea is great.&nbsp; I flattened mine and slipped it into a box that had a bottle of eyedrops in it.&nbsp; I made it a rectangle and slipped it behind the paper insert, which was attached to the inside of the box.<br /><br />for larger quantites, shipping to a hotel can work, but if you&#039;re only staying for a week or less, and you&#039;re having things shipped internationally, it might raise suspicion if someone gets curious.&nbsp; Finding a UPS store or PO box, or mail boxes etc, would work if you can work out credentials.&nbsp; Search for mailbox service &lt;your destination&gt;.
