				So I decided to purchase a hit of acid from paperchasing on saturday.&nbsp; Everything has gone smoothly, i believe it was shipped yesterday.&nbsp; However, I have recieved no correspondence from him.&nbsp; I&#039;m not worried that I&#039;m being scammed because I know he is a respected vendor, I was just expecting a little more communication.&nbsp; I sent him a message asking if he needed me to finalize early because I&#039;m relatively new, and a few other things and I have gotten no response back.&nbsp; Thought, Opinions?&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to do everything right here and I don&#039;t want to ruffle any feathers.

				I would definitely limit communication as much as possible with a busy vendor and a relatively small, small order.&nbsp; Some vendors are talkative, but paper is one of the busiest guys on here.&nbsp; I don&#039;t now anyone else based in the US that lists Hash, LSD, MDMA, Coke, Heroin, and who knows what else........those are all very popular items.<br /><br />My thoughts are to make it as easy as possible for them to do their job as fast as possible......unless there is a problem, which does not sound like the case with you.&nbsp; I often like to talk and really appreciate a vendor with communication, but you will get better info here in the forum and on SLIC IM.&nbsp; Good luck with your order.

If your order is &quot;in transit&quot; I think you just have to be patient, after all finalize early is not supposed to be the norm so he probably shipped your package.<br />Did you use PGP to write the message you sent to him ? Some vendors just ignore uncrypted messages, some don&#039;t answer if they feel it&#039;s not a priority.<br /><br />WL

You&#039;ll get your items with no problem<br /><br />My experience (I&#039;m a buyer -- not a seller) is that almost all vendors prefer less communication rather than more. You will enhance your rep as an easy, non-pain in the ass buyer if you place your order and thereafter send messages/questions only when there&#039;s a true problem. As buyer, I always appreciate it when I get a &quot;heads up, here&#039;s where we stand&quot; kind of message from the seller, but have learned not to expect it.

				Same thing happened with me bday.&nbsp; Ordered a hit of acid from Streetpharmacy, never received a response after sending my encrypted message.&nbsp; After I saw my order was &#039;in transit&#039; however I finalized early and am expecting no problems.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they are just busy and do not see a need for small talk.

				Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news but SR Discount Pharmacy is a scammer he scammed me out of hundreds of dollars and shut his page down. So I can honestly tell you not to expect your order from him....I know a real bummer huh...
