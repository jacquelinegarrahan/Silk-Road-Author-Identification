				From his page:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">News:<br /><br />June 21st -<br /><br />Sup guys. I&#039;m going through a shitty depressed state again, so orders may be backed up for a little bit. I&#039;m not going to hide it from you guys so I hope you can all understand; I&#039;m sure some of you know what it feels like :/. I&#039;m sorry about this, but you will 100% get your orders, I don&#039;t want any of you to worry about that at all. It is hard to do anything. Ugh. Please just try to work with me for the next few weeks till I feel better. If you have any concerns feel free to send me a message. If you want to cancel your order and place it later, feel free to do so, I understand.<br /><br />Also, if you are in GB #8 or #9, everything is going as planned, you guys are good. You should receive packages by the end of the month.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Let&#039;s just give him his space and he&#039;ll be back after a while, I&#039;m sure.
