				Not sure what&#039;s going on but I have not been able to get on SR all day on either of two machines. Actually, I was able to logon once, sent a message and then connection started timing out again. Have tried getting a new identity probably 40-50 times today, still nothing. Is anyone else having similar issues? <br /><br />Trying to figure out if it&#039;s just me or the SR site/servers.

				Damn, so it&#039;s not just me. I really need to get on as well asap to figure out what&#039;s going on with packages that haven&#039;t arrived and place an order before cutoff time. I don&#039;t remember it ever being offline for this long, but I am sure it&#039;s happened before.
