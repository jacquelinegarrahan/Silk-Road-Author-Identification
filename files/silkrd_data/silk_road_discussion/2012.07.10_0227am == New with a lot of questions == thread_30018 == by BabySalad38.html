				First off, I want to say that I know many, if not all, of these questions have been answered previously, but my internet is too slow for me to want to deal with it. With that said, a link to a different thread would be a fine response.<br /><br />So, now my questions:<br /><br />1) What is a good way to contact vendors? I&#039;ve tried PMing a couple, but no response.<br />2) PGP. What is it? How do I use it? Is there software compatible with Macs or should I just use Boot Camp?<br />3) Is there an eaiser way to get BitCoins into my account? Is there a service with PayPal? I really don&#039;t want to keep going to the bank and getting sketchy looks from the teller when I say, &quot;I want to deposit xxx dollars into this account.&quot; Plus fees are out the ass whenever I do it.<br /><br />Thank you all in advance.

				You could buy bitcoins off a a vendor on here using moneypaks. Go to Walmart, 7/11, or Meijer and ask for a moneypak. The card itself is like $5, but you give the cashier however much money you want to deposit onto the card. Although only some vendors will exchange moneypaks for bitcoins.<br /><br /><br />BTCpal and BlueSkyTraders are a couple trusted vendors on SR.

				1) PMing is probably the best way, or post in their thread on Rumor Mill.&nbsp; Keep in mind though, that they are usually pretty swamped and might not have time to answer questions, especially for someone who is new and might be trying to scam them or something.<br />2) Google GPG for Mac, that&#039;s what you need.<br />3) Some sites do offer PayPal or credit card payment for bitcoins, but they charge pretty hefty fees (around 11%, and a low limit on how much you can deposit).&nbsp; Apparently exchanges are the cheapest way to buy bitcoins, but I&#039;m yet to figure out how those work.
