				Feedback can be forged by vendors buying 0.00 BTC custom listings from themselves. Unlike buyer stats, which reveal how much a buyer has spent, vendor feedback is displayed based solely on the number of transactions and the grade given out of 5 in each case. So the lack of commission doesn&#039;t really change anything.

				How about..... <br /><br />When a buyer makes his or her first purchase from a vendor a randomized number would be generated and displayed next to their comments. This number would show up for every purchase from that vendor. New buyers would be able to see how many feedbacks were coming from that user and it would remain anonymous because the number would be randomized for each vendor. Along with the number it could have a member for x amount of time. If all the feedback is from accounts made that day for example people could see that and judge accordingly. <br /><br />This would not affect anonymity and would prevent sellers from inflating their rating.<br /><br />It really is way to easy for sellers to fake feedback. I know its impossible to totally prevent this, but i think it should be a little harder for the scammer vendors and i feel my method could be effective. <br /><br />Thanks for reading.

				This kind of system will always have flaws because it doesn&#039;t use the WoT model every other bitcoin marketplace uses and instead uses the failed ebay model. Too late now, would be impossible to change feedback every vendor would revolt at the loss of status<br />
