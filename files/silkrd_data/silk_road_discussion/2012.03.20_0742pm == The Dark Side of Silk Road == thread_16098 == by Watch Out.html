				Let me start by saying this forum account I am using is a sock puppet of a buyer account. I am using it because I am scared of results of criticism towards being black listed by fellow buyers or vendor accounts of Silk Road. I have bought items from Silk Road in the past, and will try to continue to buy items in the future. Some out there may see this account as being some LEO, government, troll, organized criminal, christian fundamentalist group, or maybe even a drug rehab center member. I am none of those. Please put your tin foil hats away.<br /><br />After reading over Dread Pirate Robert&#039;s &#039;chat&#039; comments I am struck by how much he sees himself as some heroic liberator, bringing drug safety and access to the masses. But I think he tends to &#039;gloss over&#039; or ignore some fundamental negatives and drawbacks of Silk Road and its impact. I must admit the positive aspect of &quot;seeming&quot; to remove the oppression of street level crime&nbsp; of buying dangerous or unknown products. The danger of under cover LEO busting the buyer or seller. The&nbsp; possible crimes of drug territory disputes or the possibilities of being robbed from seller or buyer on the street. But How far removed is Silk Road from criminal organizations and corruption really?<br /><br />Take the examples of two of the most expensive and addictive substances on silk road: heroin and cocaine. Where do you think the vendors on silk road get them from? Where do you think ultimately their supply comes from? I can tell you they are not making them from a personal field in the backyard or garage. The vast criminal organizations produce them and transport them. They are getting them from the very organizations that Dread Pirate Roberts claims to fight against. The vendors buy them from suppliers, and so the money flows right back into corrupt and criminal hands. Silk Road is in bed with the criminals , make no mistake.<br /><br />Even with the example of the growing illegal use of prescription drugs, who produces these drugs? The supply comes from governments or medical drug companies. Again the money flows back to them from Silk Road vendors. Again something Dread Pirate Roberts claims to fight against, but whoops another bed.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts claims to be some small operative rebel group, but for all we know he could be a front for a criminal organization himself, or at very least &#039;aligned&#039; with corruption and criminals instead. <br /><br />Now there are some substances on Silk Road that can come small local sources for vendors such as weed or mushrooms. Those don&#039;t seem to have that &quot;kick back&quot; money to the suppliers at least. But the bigger amounts of drugs or more potent drugs must have a money connection to supply.<br /><br />Finally I want to end with looking at the elephant in the room of children having access to dangerous drugs. Now granted I use the term &#039;children&#039; as meaning something maybe 14 years to 17 years old. A smart child maybe able to get on younger even if an older friend or relative helps. There is no control for this what so ever given the nature of silk road. So we all have to throw up our collective hands and say, &#039;screw it they would get the drugs anyway&#039;. Really people? Really? Do those of you with children, you want them to get drugs from silk road? Those of you with younger relatives? Those of you who might have children in the near future? I hope Dread Pirate Roberts can sleep at night knowing that some 15 year could overdose, or start a lifelong addiction from drugs he helped facilitate. How much of a liberator or hero will he feel then?<br /><br />He claims to free and liberate people on drugs, but all he could be doing is enabling another form of slavery with death and addiction. And that is the dark side of silk road.

I bet your a republican...wake up and smell reality man and please keep your morals to yourself..I&#039;m trying to buy drug&#039;s here for Pete&#039;s sake.

				you are talking nonsense.&nbsp; there is no cost-benefit analysis in which SR is, on net and compared to the alternatives, a negative.&nbsp; if you are interested in harm reduction then i find it hard to see how you have a problem with it.&nbsp; the cartels and their violence will only be gone when the global war on drugs ends, and SR is an important tool in making that happen.&nbsp;

				Shipping drugs, domestically at least, is FAR safer than buying in the &quot;real world&quot;, if done correctly. That means using only trusted vendors, GPG, ect.<br /><br />SR does it&#039;s best to provide a TOR/GPG-based marketplace for the masses. And it has indeed started a revolution, compared to other &quot;non-TOR based&quot; forums from the past.<br /><br />Every human being has the natural right to ingest whatever substance they feel, and do &quot;whatever they choose&quot; with their own body and mind. As long as they harm no others in the process. <br /><br />The same goes for what &quot;anyone&quot; chooses to do, with mutual consent, in their bedroom. <br /><br />It is a &quot;self-evident&quot; basic human right. Wherever drugs like H &amp; C come from is dependent on how the War on Drugs progresses, and the policies of the nations enforcing these laws.<br /><br />The supply chain is indeed an unfortunate current side-effect of the global drug supply. Although, this could realistically change with more progressive drug laws being enacted worldwide.<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

What&#039;s to stop you right now from legally buying some herbicide or rat poison and injecting it straight into your bloodstream? Nothing. What&#039;s to stop you from legally dousing yourself in petrol and lighting up, provided you don&#039;t put other people or their property at risk while you burn to a crisp? Nothing. What&#039;s to stop you legally developing an addiction to caffeine, nicotine, sugar, ethanol, saturated fat, cutting yourself and hoarding your own piss? Nothing.<br /><br />If you&#039;re free to do all that horrible shit to yourself, why the fuck shouldn&#039;t you be free to do other, much less horrible shit to yourself? You should. You should be free to develop a heroin habit, to O.D. on heroin, to produce and consume heroin marshmallows. Because your personal freedom to dispose of your body and your health however you see fit should not be the State&#039;s business. <br /><br />DPR is, to a limited extent, restoring us this freedom that the State has taken away from us. And as with any other freedom (including the freedom to I.V. rat poison, which we currently enjoy) it&#039;s up to each person to use it productively and responsibly. It&#039;s not DPR&#039;s fault if someone gets addicted to heroin, just as rat-poison-injection-related suicides aren&#039;t the State&#039;s fault simply by virtue of not banning the sale of rat poison.<br /><br />Get it?

				Good points on both sides here.&nbsp; Drugs will always have a dark undertone, and that includes the legal one we get from the doctor.&nbsp; The addictive properties of these kind of things can be very bad on society, we all have seen them destroy peoples lives.&nbsp; That said the war on drugs and all of the problems that it causes can be just as bad on society.&nbsp; From the violence from the cartels to the over crowed prison its all pretty bad.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see either of those things going away anytime soon, since that would require both users and nonusers to come to a realization that drugs can be dangerous and they are not going away.&nbsp; <br /><br />From a sellers point a view drugs are a business and in business the goal is to make money.&nbsp; Unfortunately like most business it ends up being by any means necessary for most.&nbsp; This ends up putting bad quality products on the streets, which can be more dangerous than pure good quality stuff.&nbsp; Most buyers want the pure high quality stuff but in reality they will take what ever their seller has to offer.&nbsp; The thing about SR, and its one of the things I like most, is a vendor cant sell a crappy product for very long on here.&nbsp; The community talks and with multiple vendors selling the same stuff both quality and price are big issues.&nbsp; In the real world buyers only have a few vendors they can go to for product, thus they just take what they can get.<br /><br />SR is a great place and I love what its doing, but there will always be that dark side as long as there are addicts and a war on drugs, we just cant get around that.<br /><br />As far as the kids go I wish we had some way to filter out the young ones.&nbsp; I know they are going to get there drugs regardless, but would rather them not get them from SR until they are older.&nbsp; But there is really know way to do that other than have the vendors filter a little bit.&nbsp; This wont catch them all but it will catch a few.&nbsp; But that goes against the business side of the drug game, by any means necessary.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t know!&nbsp; <br /><br />As a former seller in real life and a POW of the drug war for 6yr and a father I think it really comes down to being a good parent and being in touch with your kids like stated above.<br /><br />And before any accusations on my political party get thrown out I am much closer to being a republican than a Democrat since I do believe in a free market where you earn what your worth and only the strong survive.

				The War On Drugs has caused more damage than drugs ever will.&nbsp; When will assholes stop trying to tell people how to run their lives?&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as children go?&nbsp; Parent your kids and you will have little problems.&nbsp; I have three kids.&nbsp; One use to do LSD in his very late teens and early twenties.&nbsp; He was over 18 and old enough to make his own choices.&nbsp; Now he just drinks beer.&nbsp; Would much rather he smoked weed.&nbsp; My second child smoked a little weed in her very early twenties but, no longer does.&nbsp; My youngest, 18 I believe has tried weed/hash but, nothing more potent.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been open with my kids and we often talked about the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I&#039;d much rather have my kids smoking weed than drinking alcohol.&nbsp; Now that&#039;s a dangerous drug!

				I don&#039;t use heroin but if people are using then at least they do not have to walk into a street risking arrest or buy off teenagers working for some local dealer who takes no pride in the product and could not care less about the users.<br /><br />Many heroin addicts re treated like scum by the very people making money off them.<br /><br />Those dealing heroin here at least have some feedback as to the purity and worth of the product.<br /><br />Its not our fault that bad guys have a stake in some drug production. In the USA prohibition years did anyone not sip a drink due to the mafias making a lot of cash?<br />

				it always comes down to the children....the stupid, stupid children. parents should parent their kids and then maybe they wouldn&#039;t be dumb enough to order heroin at the age of 14. but don&#039;t lie to them either. heroin is awesome. it&#039;s that simple. it&#039;s popular for a reason. and kids will find that out through two different ways: by personal experience, or by the parent telling/educating them. which would you prefer? at least with the second option, you can expand on the reasons as to why it&#039;s awesome and why people continue using even at the risk of addiction. educate your children about the pros and cons of such drugs, without the bullshit, so when they are old enough and encounter these substances in the real world (everyone does as some point. it&#039;s inevitable), they have the knowledge to make their own personal decisions - instead of going in blind with no knowledge at all. <br /><br />education will always work better than a complete ban, personal/state prohibition, and propaganda lies. <br /><br /><br />oh, and OP, you do realize that a kid can buy literally *anything* from the internet - and by &quot;the internet&quot;, I mean the fucking internet! Silk Road is just one grain of a sand on a very large coastline beach. <br /><br />so don&#039;t blame the Road for potential personal problems one may - or may not - even encounter.

				RE: Kids<br /><br />I was 11 when I first did &quot;lighter gas&quot; and smoked my first cigarette. 12 when I first smoked weed, and drank my first beer. <br /><br />13 when i did speed and coke for the first time.<br /><br />That was my personal choice. And my &quot;right&quot; as a member of the human race. Regardless of my age at the time.<br /><br />But yes, there are unfortunately FAR too many overdoses and deaths from teenagers.

				I&#039;m pretty sure kids were acquiring drugs long before SR.&nbsp; I might be wrong...but I don&#039;t think so.<br />Plus, just looking at how I grew up, it would have been SO much more hassle to download tor, acquire bitcoins, find a reasonable vendor and place an order, and come up with an excuse as to why I received a package that I could not open in front of my parents and subsequently hid from them.&nbsp; Easier to buy behind the school and shove it in my pocket.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />As for still paying the large suppliers, I really don&#039;t care if they have my money.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Fact of the matter is, if they&#039;re the only ones that have what I want, they will get my money.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a lot more comfortable for everyone if I place an order online instead of wandering alleys drunk and in my pajamas trying to find someone to sell me cocaine.

LSD and MDMA are synthetic drugs. HEROIN is a synthetic drug. 2C-B is a synthetic drug and has been schedule I for 18 years. The legality of a substance has essentially NO link to it&#039;s relative safety---Marijuana is schedule I. 2C-I is much more potent than 2C-B and it is not scheduled, 2C-E you can hardly move you are tripping so hard and it is not scheduled.. People that cause harm to themselves are usually people who have not researched what they are about to consume, it is very rarely the fault of the DRUG that the person is harmed. It is *never* the fault of a vendor that a user is harmed, assuming they were selling what they claimed to be selling. I firmly believe it is the responsibility of the drug user to ensure that no harm comes to them, and Darwin&#039;s Law agrees with me.

				I&#039;m Back. The man (or woman, because who knows?) you love to hate. I just wanted to try to clear up some things after reading replies to this thread.

As I stated before, I have bought and will continue to use Silk Road in the future. I think everyday he is striving to battle scammers from vendors and buyers alike. The thing that struck a chord in me was the &#039;tone&#039; of his &#039;chat&#039; post in some way.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, It came off to me like some &quot;manifesto&quot;, like a steve jobs wannabe, and cult leader-ish. I mean he could have easily inserted, &quot; I woke up one day and God told me to...&quot; He seemed to have an attitude of being above it all, like cut off from the evils of typical drug trade. Silk Road is just another cog in the machine. It may be a different kind of cog. But a cog nonetheless.<br /><br />To the hypocrisy issue, I must admit I am one too. I am a hypocrite. I try to buy only weed, shrooms, and LSD I think that are local to the vendors I buy from. But the truth is that I don&#039;t truly know.

We all are criminals here, buying criminal drugs, and knowing the consequences of being caught.<br /><br />My message was to try to wake you guys up, to question authority, even DPR&#039;s and Silk Road. Dread Pirate Roberts like to think he is replacing the &quot;street pusher&quot;, when he just might be just creating a &quot; digital pusher&quot; to take his place.

My first full day of high school long ago, there were students in the lunch room passing around a bag of white powder and snorting from it ( I did not partake). That is a honest to god true memory. I must have been 14 years old at the time. I realize that vendors can&#039;t really quiz or weed out young buyers.&nbsp; This is just a possible evil we are have to live with on Silk Road.<br /><br />I must apologize for seeming to single out cocaine and heroin to those users out there. But they are two big ones of the big criminal organizations you must admit. I could have added hash, meth, xtc, but sometimes those can come from smaller sources.<br /><br />Well I hope I just didn&#039;t come off as someone criticizing one manifesto, and trying to replace it with their own. Think for yourselves guys! Don&#039;t lose sight of the big picture. Don&#039;t take Silk Road as a nirvana sprouting forth endless and never ending milk of the gods. Its better than the streets, but it could also be worse than streets in some ways too.<br /><br />I will only post a little more in here possibly. I am scared of revealing too much of myself. I am just one of you all. One of nameless. faceless crowd. Let me end with a quote from the character of Dread Pirate Roberts, &quot; Life is full of pain and suffering. Anyone who tells you different is trying to sell you something.&quot; And Ironically that could be DPR himself.

				Even a lot of (but by no means all...)&nbsp; LSD comes from organizations that are closer to bloods&amp;crips than happy hippies. Not gonna give specific details though. Most mass produced drugs have a good chance of having their manufacture and initial distribution controlled by traditional drug trafficking organizations, and traditional DTOs tend to consist of violent people. You are going to be hard pressed to be involved with the drug trade without having mafia-esque gangs a few links away from you, unless you are buying stuff (like pot/shrooms) with much more distributed production. Almost all MDMA is made with chemicals supplied by Triads. <br /><br />Of course this is entirely the governments fault. They create the market that allows this to happen, they fund all of these gangs and they fund the terrorists who profit from the drug trade. The gov and their friends profit, the gangs profit, everyone else gets fucked and innocent people get trapped in the cross fire.

Their making up the laws as they go along&nbsp; too. I wouldn&#039;t put to much faith in your fate, if your poor and have to use a public defender.<br />I wonder what they could spend that money on that there using to spy and control us?

I mean if you don&#039;t have anything to hide then we all should be OK. right? All that nasty stuff there doing is just to catch &quot;the bad guys.&quot; Hey man you have to cast a wide net to get the evil doers!

				<br />&quot;And this is what should be fought: a future of hunger, forced migration, and thinly disguised slave labor.&nbsp; Not the drug war. For the drug war--as designed, waged, and imposed on other nations by the U.S. government--is not a war of political beliefs, or manifestos and declarations, a war for homeland, defense of nation, or liberation. The drug war is a proxy war for racism, militarization, social control, and access to the truckloads of cash that illegality makes possible. The drug war itself is a violent criminal enterprise. To stand by and watch it rage is to step inside the silence that hangs over every anonymous death, bow our heads, and wait our turn.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; --To Die in Mexico: Dispatches from Inside the Drug War by John Gibler

				Saying DPR is coming off as some kind of savior, well, he did design this place.&nbsp; It&#039;s outlasted OVDB and I think it&#039;s more successful than BMR.<br />Is this place &quot;heaven sent?&quot;&nbsp; Maybe not, but it kicks the ass out of any other illegal drug distribution system.<br />DPR deserves some pretty big kudos for creating this place, and if he&#039;s an idealist, well, fine... it&#039;s his fucking road!&nbsp; It&#039;s his company, let him run it!&nbsp; I guess, as on any pirate ship, some folks think mutiny is a good thing.<br /><br />Kids?&nbsp; Well, the whole point of anonymity is to remain anonymous.&nbsp; I like to think most sellers would refuse to sell to a kid if they knew he/she was a kid.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the only and best way to keep drugs out of the hands of children, is to legalize and regulate the products, like we&#039;ve done with alcohol and tobacco.<br /><br />So even in THAT perfect world some kids will still succeed in their mission to get high as fuck, as they succeed to get smokes and drink their faces off.<br /><br />Without the road, kids not only can get anything, they can also get things they didn&#039;t want in the first place.&nbsp; My first &quot;drug buy&quot; as a kid was for a gram of weed.&nbsp; The guy showed up with four hits of acid instead.&nbsp; I only ever wanted to try organic drugs, and wound up dropping acid because it was all he had and I was reassured by peer pressure that it was ok to try.<br />It was fucking GREAT, as it turns out, but it illustrates the gateway to harder drugs is actually illegal dealers, and not any drug itself.<br /><br />Here, you get what you pay for, 99% of the time.&nbsp; 100% if you avoid scammers.<br />The vendors are knowledgeable about their products, and you don&#039;t have to leave your home.&nbsp; Product is usually decent, and it is reviewed by peers, allowing you to check it out before you buy.&nbsp; What&#039;s better than that?

				Hi, me again. I have to say that all of your very thought provoking and insightful replies have made me rethink my viewpoint. Maybe its truly not the dark side of silk road I have a problem with, but the dark side of drug use and the drug trade. I myself have to step back and look at the big picture.<br /><br />I can&#039;t blame DPR for bringing out his positive views of Silk Road. After all he is the proud &#039;parent&#039; of his &#039;child&#039; Silk Road. I think if I was in his shoes, I would do the same thing. Try to put forth that same view.<br /><br />I think what was truly bothering me was the inherent fear and paranoia of drug use itself: the lying, the hiding, the &#039;double life&#039;, the shame. This life of trying to buy illegal drugs online. I think your posts have made me realize its not silk road that&#039;s to blame. It is something bigger and more deep. It is societies, it is governments, it is social orders and laws, those are the &#039;something&#039; bearing down on drug use and the drug trade.<br /><br />I feel after some soul searching I have to take a break from Silk road and drug use. Call me a quitter if you must.&nbsp; But I must thank you out there for sharing your viewpoints, You have made me look both outward and inward. I might come back someday, but part of me hopes I don&#039;t . I will leave this thread open if you wish to continue the discussion. So the dark side may not be Silk Road, but just illegal drugs in general. Take care and enjoy your lives whether on drugs or not.

I am using it because I am scared of results of criticism towards being black listed by fellow buyers or vendor accounts of Silk Road. I have bought items from Silk Road in the past, and will try to continue to buy items in the future. Some out there may see this account as being some LEO, government, troll, organized criminal, christian fundamentalist group, or maybe even a drug rehab center member. I am none of those. Please put your tin foil hats away.<br /><br />After reading over Dread Pirate Robert&#039;s &#039;chat&#039; comments I am struck by how much he sees himself as some heroic liberator, bringing drug safety and access to the masses. But I think he tends to &#039;gloss over&#039; or ignore some fundamental negatives and drawbacks of Silk Road and its impact. I must admit the positive aspect of &quot;seeming&quot; to remove the oppression of street level crime&nbsp; of buying dangerous or unknown products. The danger of under cover LEO busting the buyer or seller. The&nbsp; possible crimes of drug territory disputes or the possibilities of being robbed from seller or buyer on the street. But How far removed is Silk Road from criminal organizations and corruption really?<br /><br />Take the examples of two of the most expensive and addictive substances on silk road: heroin and cocaine. Where do you think the vendors on silk road get them from? Where do you think ultimately their supply comes from? I can tell you they are not making them from a personal field in the backyard or garage. The vast criminal organizations produce them and transport them. They are getting them from the very organizations that Dread Pirate Roberts claims to fight against. The vendors buy them from suppliers, and so the money flows right back into corrupt and criminal hands. Silk Road is in bed with the criminals , make no mistake.<br /><br />Even with the example of the growing illegal use of prescription drugs, who produces these drugs? The supply comes from governments or medical drug companies. Again the money flows back to them from Silk Road vendors. Again something Dread Pirate Roberts claims to fight against, but whoops another bed.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts claims to be some small operative rebel group, but for all we know he could be a front for a criminal organization himself, or at very least &#039;aligned&#039; with corruption and criminals instead. <br /><br />Now there are some substances on Silk Road that can come small local sources for vendors such as weed or mushrooms. Those don&#039;t seem to have that &quot;kick back&quot; money to the suppliers at least. But the bigger amounts of drugs or more potent drugs must have a money connection to supply.<br /><br />Finally I want to end with looking at the elephant in the room of children having access to dangerous drugs. Now granted I use the term &#039;children&#039; as meaning something maybe 14 years to 17 years old. A smart child maybe able to get on younger even if an older friend or relative helps. There is no control for this what so ever given the nature of silk road. So we all have to throw up our collective hands and say, &#039;screw it they would get the drugs anyway&#039;. Really people? Really? Do those of you with children, you want them to get drugs from silk road? Those of you with younger relatives? Those of you who might have children in the near future? I hope Dread Pirate Roberts can sleep at night knowing that some 15 year could overdose, or start a lifelong addiction from drugs he helped facilitate. How much of a liberator or hero will he feel then?<br /><br />He claims to free and liberate people on drugs, but all he could be doing is enabling another form of slavery with death and addiction. And that is the dark side of silk road.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually I think that you&#039;re over thinking this , the under lining principle is &quot; let people do what they wish with their own bodies/time/money&quot;

				Shut the f**k up about children getting drugs. we have the oldest fucking &#039;children&#039; in the world. 18 year old adolescence, purpose they get their hands imbedded in a venture and import some commodities - at least this would engage them, oppose to rotting away in prison, cough* school**. and it&#039;d be better preparation for them to being successful, than any senior project a public school can offer. <br /><br />Now let me ask you this, what about the benefits. these children never have to get robbed, or scammed in real life and feel like a sucker. That is surely better than the streets.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways the casualty of a 14+ year old getting cocaine is no where near close to the destruction governments do, so start at gov if u really care about people u damn fool. then this SR wouldn&#039;t be necessary assh0le.

				Like the OP I created this sock puppet account. <br /><br />But I am 17. I have been using SR for sometime now-- I do not do meth, crack, etc. I have only tried weed, shrooms, salvia, and ecstasy (xtc twice by personal choice though I dont plan to use it again) <br /><br />My parents are aware I smoke and they have always been very open with me about drugs, sex, yada-yada. They prefer I stay home and get high than run the street with friends. <br /><br />As for SR it is one of the best things I&#039;ve discovered. Before my knowledge of it I payed rip off prices to half ass dealers who provided mediocre services. These dealers were the same ones who threatened me because I counted wrong and accidently shorted them $5. Though they were probably just showing off their &quot;authority&quot;. <br /><br />On SR I feel safe from being jumped or anything like it. I know the product isn&#039;t spiked, reviews let me know who is honest, and I pay roughly 1/2 the street price. <br /><br /><br />I have no inclanation to try harder dugs

				Mr. Watch Out,<br /><br />I really don&#039;t think anyone is under the illusion that SilkRoad is helping prevent organized crime, or that their drugs are coming from thin air, or some magic heroin or cocaine tree.<br /><br />Also, the same argument for &quot;kids&quot; getting a hold of drugs from SilkRoad is: keep a better eye on your kids. I can&#039;t stand these parents that don&#039;t notice that their kid did heroin until it&#039;s too late. WTF were you doing instead of parenting? You didn&#039;t notice ANY warning signs that your kid might be interested in drugs? Where did your kid get the money to pay for heroin, his paper route?<br /><br />And yes, you are a hypocrite if you use silkroad at all, even for little things that you think aren&#039;t that big of a deal. I just hope you don&#039;t narc everyone out if you get too fucked up or busted.

				&lt;sigh&gt;<br /><br />I feel like I&#039;m passing through the history of Pine Philosophy here. I remember thinking and believing pretty much everything everybody&#039;s posted in this thread, obviously at different stages of my life.<br /><br />On the unimportant subject of whether DPR has a ego. Duh. You have to believe in yourself and an ideology in order to accomplish great things. Everybody has this. Everybody wants to believe they are unique, special. Pine does this. You do this. Everybody does. Actually that is true no matter what you achieve or don&#039;t. It&#039;s not that important though. Everybody yearns for a higher purpose in life, that&#039;s why science, religion, art and philosophy exist. I call that ambition, others call it conceit when it fails or doesn&#039;t quite live up to expectations. I think they miss the point.<br /><br />Out of all things posted, my perspective today is closest to the sentiments of SuperDimitri. Morality so subjective when you look at the practical effects. People would rather die than change their mind set (set of concepts in their mind). In fact, they do.<br /><br />I broadly agree with kmf, but in a less dystopian way, I don&#039;t see it as being that orchestrated even if people attempt to make it so. kmf, maybe you need more sunlight, feminine comforts and kittens in your life ;-) &lt;insert sarcastic/cynical remark here&gt;<br /><br />On the other hand, a lot of people fall prey to parnassusian views of what is possible. MDMA, LSD, they, ah, don&#039;t show you the real world so much as a one sided version of it. Reminds of me extrapolating investment compounded returns when I was kid, nothing is so straight forward. Competition and contradictions exist. There is nothing wrong with violence and conflict. They are as much part of the human race as love and friendship. Is killing people wrong? It&#039;s like asking what the smell of yellow is. It depends. I mean, if you try to kill me, pine, I will think you are evil and attempt to murder you first. I am not a relativist when that happens! But at the same time, it&#039;s absurd to think that globally, generally, X is wrong and Y is right. You would have to be omniscience to know that, you&#039;re unintentionally claiming god-like powers there.<br /><br />--<br /><br />On the persistently occurring subject of &#039;cartel-bashing&#039; or &#039;mafia-bashing&#039;. This isn&#039;t that smart. Some of you guys are watching too much bad daytime TV and absorbed more fiction about organized crime than fact. Sure cartels kill people. Duh. But did you ever consider that a motley crew of thousands of small gangs are far more violent in reality? Did you ever consider that &#039;protection&#039;, actually serves a legitimately useful function in society, especially those without a functioning police force or legal institutions.<br /><br />Remember The Leviathan (the book that invented the concept of modern state). A centralized authority with a monopoly on coercion generally *reduces*&nbsp; the overall rate of violence in society. The external rate of violence within the region/domain of that centralized authority does increase. e.g. inter-state wars, mafia wars. But internally, the rate of violence dramatically declines.<br /><br />Yes, state violence has characterized the 20th century. But ironically, this was also in per capita terms, the least violence century in history. There are a lot of similarities here to how markets create externalizes that are negative e.g. toxic waste dumping in countries that can&#039;t stop it, having lead in Chinese children&#039;s milk etc.<br /><br />Yet the massive powers of internal efficiency inside markets are so enormously powerful that markets are literally the engine of the human race. They are our greatest tool and weapon, even if they are abused. The capitalists make the tool operate, the socialists try to ensure the tool doesn&#039;t start telling the operator what to do. So they both have a function even if I hate those commie bastards and I gotta accept that.<br /><br />The Silk Road will kill people. That&#039;s just a matter of time. That is a foregone conclusion and DPR&#039;s cross to bear if you think of it in those terms. And that is completely irrelevant. Look at the opportunity costs to *not* using the Silk Road. Bad dope, less regulated marketplaces will kill far more people than DPR&#039;s system. This is a more efficient way, and that is all there is to it. Globalization destroys people&#039;s lives, jobs. But the net result is positive on balance. It might be evil for you, and good for the world or visa versa.<br /><br /><br />

				I would agree, the dark side to silk road is not a product of the road, but the dark side of society itself.&nbsp; Kids will always be able to get their hands on liquor, tobacco and drugs.&nbsp; It&#039;s in our nature to experiment... and some of us (likely any of you reading this) are a little more adventurous than the average person.<br /><br />I think even if drugs were legalized SR would still be a good place to come... only you could use your credit card or PayPal, and use overnight courier services.<br /><br />The war has long been proven ineffective.&nbsp; In most western countries drug use is waaay up, and , crime is waaay down.&nbsp; The product of our high demand for drugs, legal and illegal is violence in third-world countries where they manufacture/supply some of the products.&nbsp; There is legal cocaine manufacture in some countries, and they export it to the big pharmas to make various medications.&nbsp; If this shit were legalized there would be no reason to shoot people, and it would be cheap enough that addiction would totally be more of a health issue than a criminal one.&nbsp; That&#039;s what the legalized drug taxes would pay for... treatment and prevention.<br /><br />I am very thankful for this place, and to DPR for creating it, this is unprecedented freedom in our time of struggle.

				Just found this thread, a lot to read through.<br /><br />To OP, ultimately we ALLLLLL contribute to the pain in the world. It&#039;s called capitalism.

Don&#039;t forget the medical industry. Big pharma. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s all capitalism folks. And some here have a decent stake in it. It&#039;s a fucking blessing for many ain&#039;t it? But you can&#039;t blame this place for a child ordering drugs and od&#039;ing when most kids get oxy&#039;s and xannies from their parents med cabs. <br /><br />This place is probably overall a much BETTER network than regular commerce... because many in these parts.... have... a.... fucking.... code.

				ITT druggies don&#039;t care about the children.<br /><br />Everyone who comes to SR does it for one big reason - to buy drugs. Nobody roped them in here, everyone knew what they were doing (while sober, at least). As for the drug money funding FARC, Taliban, and the cartels - if that&#039;s a problem for you, then you may as well just stop voting and paying taxes, because every time Army kids blow someone&#039;s family away oversees, or a weak prisoner is getting raped and abused by a stronger one, that was your money at work supporting the System.

The British did do this before, it was called the Opium Wars, they were importing 1000 tons of opium per year into China every year in the early 1800s.<br /><br />For comparison, the total world production of opium is about 8000 tons and as you&#039;d imagine our populations are massively bigger. Drugs have been used by states as methods of social and political control since inception. In the case of the Chinese, I&#039;m not sure how much sympathy I have for the anti-trade 1800 government. They crippled their own country. Many misguided ideas about reality continued until the Japanese invasions, a major wake up call. And then they fell prey to communism... China has been it&#039;s own worst enemy for over 2 centuries, and only snapped out of it lately.<br /><br />Today, drugs are infinitely more powerful than before. Today, I shudder to think what would happen if a government used a drug to exercise ideological control over its population. Drugs are only expensive because they are illegal or intellectual property. Xanax for example, is extremely cheap to produce, but is sold for 500,000% the cost of manufacture albeit that&#039;s an unusual example. You could stockpile enough LSD for the entire planet&#039;s population for the rest of the century if you only had the right people, equipment and materials for a month or two. If a government controls all drug manufacture, you&#039;ll eventually get a chemical dystopia.

I am using it because I am scared of results of criticism towards being black listed by fellow buyers or vendor accounts of Silk Road. I have bought items from Silk Road in the past, and will try to continue to buy items in the future. Some out there may see this account as being some LEO, government, troll, organized criminal, christian fundamentalist group, or maybe even a drug rehab center member. I am none of those. Please put your tin foil hats away.<br /><br />After reading over Dread Pirate Robert&#039;s &#039;chat&#039; comments I am struck by how much he sees himself as some heroic liberator, bringing drug safety and access to the masses. But I think he tends to &#039;gloss over&#039; or ignore some fundamental negatives and drawbacks of Silk Road and its impact. I must admit the positive aspect of &quot;seeming&quot; to remove the oppression of street level crime&nbsp; of buying dangerous or unknown products. The danger of under cover LEO busting the buyer or seller. The&nbsp; possible crimes of drug territory disputes or the possibilities of being robbed from seller or buyer on the street. But How far removed is Silk Road from criminal organizations and corruption really?<br /><br />Take the examples of two of the most expensive and addictive substances on silk road: heroin and cocaine. Where do you think the vendors on silk road get them from? Where do you think ultimately their supply comes from? I can tell you they are not making them from a personal field in the backyard or garage. The vast criminal organizations produce them and transport them. They are getting them from the very organizations that Dread Pirate Roberts claims to fight against. The vendors buy them from suppliers, and so the money flows right back into corrupt and criminal hands. Silk Road is in bed with the criminals , make no mistake.<br /><br />Even with the example of the growing illegal use of prescription drugs, who produces these drugs? The supply comes from governments or medical drug companies. Again the money flows back to them from Silk Road vendors. Again something Dread Pirate Roberts claims to fight against, but whoops another bed.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts claims to be some small operative rebel group, but for all we know he could be a front for a criminal organization himself, or at very least &#039;aligned&#039; with corruption and criminals instead. <br /><br />Now there are some substances on Silk Road that can come small local sources for vendors such as weed or mushrooms. Those don&#039;t seem to have that &quot;kick back&quot; money to the suppliers at least. But the bigger amounts of drugs or more potent drugs must have a money connection to supply.<br /><br />Finally I want to end with looking at the elephant in the room of children having access to dangerous drugs. Now granted I use the term &#039;children&#039; as meaning something maybe 14 years to 17 years old. A smart child maybe able to get on younger even if an older friend or relative helps. There is no control for this what so ever given the nature of silk road. So we all have to throw up our collective hands and say, &#039;screw it they would get the drugs anyway&#039;. Really people? Really? Do those of you with children, you want them to get drugs from silk road? Those of you with younger relatives? Those of you who might have children in the near future? I hope Dread Pirate Roberts can sleep at night knowing that some 15 year could overdose, or start a lifelong addiction from drugs he helped facilitate. How much of a liberator or hero will he feel then?<br /><br />He claims to free and liberate people on drugs, but all he could be doing is enabling another form of slavery with death and addiction. And that is the dark side of silk road.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />you sound like that informant btcmachine&nbsp; and all pleasewatch out for him btcmachine is leo

Much, much safer than anything you&#039;ll find on a street corner. There is no dark side. If an adult chooses to consume a substance that is his/her choice and right because it is his/her body, not the states.

				a little context ...<br /><br />Although money laundering may occur through the private, business and banking sectors, the securities industry and governments are completely immune, by law, to money laundering. This is the place the richest people in the world play daily with their drug proceeds.<br /><br />Government intelligence orgs import drugs, then sell to protected distribution systems, while the unprotected get targeted and busted by the DEA because they are competition. They also routinely set up busts for PR purposes to make the citizens worry about the drug &quot;problem&quot; and so the war on drugs looks like its doing something to protect them. Then those same governments fight a war on the very drugs against their own people they import. Its the same vicious circle of the criminal justice system where they create and need crime, then indoctrinate you to think they are fighting it. They need drugs and crime. It all about wealth, controlling you, and power. Specifically the British East India Trading Company, a British Royal Crown Company (owned by the Queen of England), of which the CIA and British Intelligence work for in their drug trafficing.<br /><br />Anyone remember the Iran/Contra Drugs for Guns fiasco ?<br /><br />Remember Mike Rupperts expose of the CIA&#039;s drug runnig operations ?<br /><br />Remember Mena Arkansas when Clinton was Governor ? ... it was a huge distribution center!<br /><br />Remember Afghanistan? The Taliban outlawed Opium growing and export under penalty of death for what the drug trade and usage was doing to their people...to protect their people. This made afghanistan go from number 1 in the world to the bottom. We are talking billions or trillions of dollars folks. They missed that revenue. Shortly thereafter we have a world wide war on terror and the first thing the new afghani government did was approve opium production which made afghanistan number one opium producer and exporter. I wont go into the oil pipeline from russia to the caspian sea or the regions only warm water port being a part of it because they are beyond the scope of this thread.<br /><br />We know elites, governments and intelligence agencies traffic drugs for profit, but oh how quickly we forget, and many of us simply do not know our history!<br /><br />Its all about wealth, control, and power.<br /><br />Specifically taking yours for their own benefit, through their trafficing, dealing, distribution, and manufacture, then law enforcement.<br /><br />So the banks, the elites, securities industry, and governments are fully protected and never prosecuted concerning drugs and their minions traffic them.<br /><br />So please, stop listening to the conditioning and manipulative propaganda which only exist to control you, steal your wealth, imprison and to enslave us that keep us fighting each other instead of concentrating on reforms and education.<br /><br />Do what you want to do but act responsibly.<br /><br />Educate and parent your kids. If you allow them unfettered private access to devices and networked connectivity without supervision, you deserve whatever you get, unless you want the totalitarian tyrannical nanny state taking over for you.<br /><br />

This life of trying to buy illegal drugs online. I think your posts have made me realize its not silk road that&#039;s to blame. It is something bigger and more deep. It is societies, it is governments, it is social orders and laws, those are the &#039;something&#039; bearing down on drug use and the drug trade.<br /><br />I feel after some soul searching I have to take a break from Silk road and drug use.

She apparently re thought her methods after reading some replies, and scared herself into going straight, and left SR and the online drug scene. End of story as far as I can tell. <br /><br />I guess I find it funny that people are reading the first post without going thru the whole thread, and wanting to rant back at someone who basically ran off and left SR.

And it has indeed started a revolution, compared to other &quot;non-TOR based&quot; forums from the past.<br /><br />Every human being has the natural right to ingest whatever substance they feel, and do &quot;whatever they choose&quot; with their own body and mind. As long as they harm no others in the process. <br /><br />The same goes for what &quot;anyone&quot; chooses to do, with mutual consent, in their bedroom. <br /><br />It is a &quot;self-evident&quot; basic human right. Wherever drugs like H &amp; C come from is dependent on how the War on Drugs progresses, and the policies of the nations enforcing these laws.<br /><br />The supply chain is indeed an unfortunate current side-effect of the global drug supply. Although, this could realistically change with more progressive drug laws being enacted worldwide.<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />The Flipside Crew<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />words of wisdom here. i agree man

				Unless drugs are legalized/decriminalized there is no hope of ever taking the drug trade away from &quot;terrorists and criminals.&quot;<br />Some fucker on FOX&#039; website made a comment on a story about drug legalization saying basically he feared if drugs were legalized the criminals would just move from the street to the boardrooms.<br /><br />Well, that would be a good thing.&nbsp; If you turn him into a pure businessman, he&#039;s not going to run into the boardroom like Tony Montana and wave around an AK.&nbsp; When liquor prohibition ended, the ones who ran the liquor had the connects and expertise to just kept getting rich.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any Bronfmans running around with tommy guns in Montreal.&nbsp; Oh NO we&#039;re supporting former criminals every time we buy a drink.<br /><br />To top this all off, blame the taliban all you want, they were the ones who destroyed the heroin trade in Afghanistan before all this 9/11 BS went down.&nbsp; The ONLY reason Afghanistan was invaded was to get at Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda because the taliban government wouldn&#039; give him up.&nbsp; Even when afghan heroin wasn&#039;t flowing, nobody did without.&nbsp; Asian heroin became really big.&nbsp; There will always be someone to fill a demand.
