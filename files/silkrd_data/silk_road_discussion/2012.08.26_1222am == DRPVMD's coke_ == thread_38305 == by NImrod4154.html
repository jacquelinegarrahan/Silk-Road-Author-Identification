It&#039;s probably the best coke I&#039;ve ever had to be honest with you, but I haven&#039;t had any good coke at all lol.

				drpvmd has the real scale, he doesn&#039;t get much of it and only stocks it once a week and it goes fast.&nbsp; Whatever is leftover to his reserved customers is left for Thursdays.&nbsp; It&#039;s honestly as good as the best coke I&#039;ve had.

				Dr&#039;s coke is one of the best domestically in the U.S.<br /><br />It is true fishscale.&nbsp; The smell of the rocket fuel is pungent and you can smell it a mile away.&nbsp; <br /><br />One little bump will get you off for a good amount of time.&nbsp; You ever see pictures of the shiny/sheen coke online? Well that is what you get, FISH SCALE.<br /><br />It it well worth the price and it really can&#039;t get any better than his product.&nbsp; Dr is also one of the most polite and professional man I have dealt with.&nbsp; A true pro.<br /><br />He is a badass, I&#039;m assuming he has connects to mexican cartels and that is how he gets such fucking amazing shit.&nbsp; Nothing can compare to his stuff in the states. <br /><br />If you look for my reviews you will see some of his fishscale pictures and it is no joke.&nbsp; This is bump and cruise shit.&nbsp; Do a line and you will be tweaked out of your mind.<br /><br /><br />I got to get some of his stuff soon again!
