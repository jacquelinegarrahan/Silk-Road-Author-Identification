				Hey, i just was turned on to Silk Road through an article and for a Psychedelic Drug-User such as myself in a rural town with no such Psychedelics around..SR seems too good to be true. The problem is that I am here simply because i would love to buy some drugs for a Pretty Lights (Band) Concert on Wednesday, August 29th in Columbus...Im sure some of you can relate to that. I found out about SR on thursday and was told it would take 4 days to get BitCoins....well im here because i have a bank account and any help would be awesome. I tried using a bitcoin website i just need help. I want 300$ worth of bitcoins and i will tip you for your help...HOW CAN I GET BITCOINS TODAY I HAVE MONEY!!!! I WANT SHROOMS hahahahah thanks again!!!

				Feel free to do so, we&#039;ve all been at that spot some time in our career.<br /><br />Remember to ask a vendor to ship it ASAP and also pick the fastest shipping possible to ensure that it arrives before the event. And obviously you don&#039;t want to order outside of the US for this occasion, customs will probably delay the shipment.<br /><br />@Your latest reply:<br /><br />I highly recommend &quot;Bitcoin to email&quot;. What you&#039;re going to do is provide a real email address. When BitInstant asks you to create a PIN, make sure to remember it or write it down. After paying with whichever method you selected, you&#039;ll get an email from Coinapult with a link to Bitcoin transaction. You enter your pin and then enter the Bitcoin address you&#039;re sending it to from Coinapult, which can be found on your Silk Road account page.<br /><br />This might seem a little confusing at first, but trust me, after the first time it&#039;s very easy.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use your real name and don&#039;t share your location here. There is law enforcement on the website, and while they&#039;re not going after someone who makes an order or two once in a while, it&#039;s better safe than sorry.

				Lol, don&#039;t worry about mentioning Columbus, LE isn&#039;t going to pinpoint you that way, especially since you&#039;re using TOR at the moment.<br /><br />However, if that&#039;s your real name, please let us know so I can delete the quoted messages and hopefully an administrator will delete or change your account name.<br /><br />You can just edit your original post.<br /><br />And we&#039;re not just drug users, we&#039;re people who like to get shit done the right way.

				Yes, you print the slip out and bring it to a bank.<br /><br />What I do though is use MoneyGram through the CVS option. Check out all of the cash deposit methods to get an idea of what&#039;s the best way to do it. The bank method is pretty common though, and the people at the bank should know what you&#039;re talking about as long as you show them the slip.<br /><br />Message this guy, he&#039;ll help you out with the name: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=1<br /><br />In your forum account profile there is an option to delete your forum account, but that will still leave your posts here with the same name, just as guest. I&#039;d wait for a reply from the user I linked you to.

				Why don&#039;t you just pick Major Bank Branch =&gt; Bitcoin to email, print the slip out, go to your bank, withdraw the money, and then show them slip and give them the money you just withdrew. Then you&#039;ll get the email by the time you get home and you can send it to your Silk Road bitcoin address.

				DEM BUTTONS. Look for dem buttons.<br /><br />On that quote page there should be an orange button&quot;Go!&quot; right above the quote. If you&#039;re using the site with TOR, give it time to load.

				After you pay IRL, you&#039;ll get an email from Coinapult. You follow the link there, enter the PIN you made on Bitinstant, and then it&#039;ll ask for an address to send it to. Got to your account page on your Silk Road account and there will be a string of letters and numbers, that&#039;s your btc address for your SR account.

Are you a newb at reading too? <br /><br />Allow me to explain. <br /><br />Everyone in this thread has done more then I have seen avg done to help a &quot;newb get coins&quot;. <br /><br />Everything else you say is a liability not only to everyone here, but mostly to yourself.<br /><br />Present yourself proper. <br />Mostly buyers here helping you, but vendors read these threads too, and decide what kind of people they want to do business with based on the way someone acts.<br /><br />On to getting you coins. <br /><br />It is an unfortunate truth that you are going to have to leave the house today. <br />Yes Im sure its been a while since you ventured out there into the wild, but your gonna have to do it. <br />Do it in the name of shrooms!<br /><br />Go to bitinstant and just pick a damn method already. <br />I would personally base my chossen method on an inner dialoug that goes something like this...here is me thinking..and by me I mean YOU:<br /><br />&quot;hmmmm The closest Walmart is 20 minutes away and mom is at work until 5pm. because I don&#039;t have a car)<br />&nbsp;I never saw a Wells Fargo Bank...but WAIT!!...there is a CVS and a 7/11. Yeah I was just there to buy a pack of smokes....ok I&#039;ll go to CVS!&quot;<br /><br /><br />.....once you have had your own version of that conversation in your head. Then ask questions that are directly TIED to that particular method.<br /><br />bitinstant really couldnt be too much easier.<br /><br />Just when you thought you were the only one that ever needed to get coins...there was this post. A post that as of right now is still on page 1 of the security section of the forum. Suffice it to say you wouldn&#039;t have had to look to hard for it.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36048.0<br /><br />Now. If you DO happen to want to use Wells Fargo Bank.
