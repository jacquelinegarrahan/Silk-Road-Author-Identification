				How do you tell if you have mids - or trips etc?<br />What does trips even stand for?<br />I can guess mids is mid quality.<br /><br />Also, M39, what category would that fall in, has anyone tried it is it any good? THANKS

				I am not familiar with the term &quot;trips&quot;, but &quot;mids&quot; refers to average quality as you said.&nbsp; I am familiar with most terms for MJ in the USA.&nbsp; Is this a term you heard in another country?&nbsp; Regardless, trips sounds like it would refer to MJ high in THC.&nbsp; THC is the chemical that makes MJ trippy/psychedelic, as opposed to the other cannabinoids that give the body high or medicinal pain relieving quality such as cannabidiol&nbsp; and cannabinol, which attenuate or reduce the trippy effects of MJ and give a more mellow, relaxing and pain relieving quality to weed.&nbsp; The differences between different strains are largely due to the ratios of these three main phyto-cannabinoids.&nbsp; It is of course more complex than this, as there are other cannabinoids that may have some effect on the high (and there are many variations within these molecules as well), as well as terpenes/terpenoids, which give MJ strains their distinctive aromas, but new research suggests they may affect the quality of the high as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is from memory only, but I recall M39 is one of the precursor strains to modern day diesel strains.&nbsp; It was blended with other precursor strains to develop the modern sour diesel, chemdawg, headband/707 -- anything with a &quot;chemical&quot; or diesel smell.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, its addition to the other precursors was mainly to bulk up, add weight and volume to the derived strain, although it is said to have a chemical smell on its own.&nbsp; It is rarely sold retail.&nbsp; You can buy M39 seeds on the net and a breeder might buy them in order to mix with other strains or perhaps to grow for its own use.

				M39 is a commercial strain that&#039;s grown a lot in Canada.Usually looks and smells great, but lacks in potency.&nbsp; It is in no way related to any of the modern diesel strains, poster above knows not what he typeth of.

				M-39 is a decent, respectable Indica dom strain. Easy to grow so it&#039;s used by commercial farmers a LOT. Which means that (unless the farmers actually give a fuck) that the plant will be harvested too early or not flushed or not this or that. A lot of commercial dealers dont care about quality, they want weight. <br /><br />As for trips, never heard of it. I go by Schwagg, Mids, High mids, Goods and Primo. <br /><br />M39 would probably be mids to high mids depending on the grower.&nbsp;

				Appreciate all the awesome info, thanks a lot.<br /><br />I never heard of trips either so I was a lil confused,<br />he said this to me: &quot;its probably trips for that price, and either way I could make a profit selling it as dubs&quot;<br /><br />have no idea what he means lol.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered some from mrouid, do you think I could pass it off as &quot;kush&quot; to people?<br />I don&#039;t want to tell someone I have kush then they see this M39 and think its garbage, and I&#039;m not a weed smoker myself really so I&nbsp; wouldn&#039;t know the difference.

				In the USA it is not common at all.&nbsp; Its not sold under its own name that I&#039;ve ever encountered in the US, which tells you something about its quality.&nbsp; I know nothing about Canada.&nbsp; As I said, its not a common strain in the US as its not potent.&nbsp; The fact is that in the USA M39 is mainly considered a rudimentary breeding stock weed used by beginning breeders to bulk up a variety of strains, including diesels, which on their own often do not produce much per plant.&nbsp; It is not &quot;related&quot; to modern deisel strains, it is a precursor strain, and any diesel you purchase today will likely have M39 as one of its precursors.&nbsp; This is because it has a nice chem-like smell and large buds, which complement diesel strains well.&nbsp; This is just fact.<br /><br />inthedaytimewitha -- I actually do know what I&#039;m talking about and its not polite to impugn others on the forums, especially when your knowledge is limited to the fact that M39 is a commercial strain grown a lot in Canada.&nbsp; Its best to show each other some respect as we are all drawing from different knowledge-pools -- what might be true in Quebec or BC, might not be true in New Jersey.<br /><br />thinkinofvendor -- you could probably pass it off as &quot;kush&quot; as it does have an indica base, but I wouldn&#039;t advise trying to pass off M39 as high quality kush as that description usually applies to potent MJ from Afghanistan or India that has a strong body high (couchlock type weed).<br />

				havent heard of trips when talking about weed ,are you shore it was trips and not tips . When some one has low grade weed they might say they have leaf and tips but there will be 99% leaf and 1% tips so what they really have is leaf and leaf&nbsp; is usually for free or $20 for 1/2 a oz . One would find if some body is selling leaf with tips the weed would be from a stolen crop . No grower will harvest when he/she has tips showing because if they have made it that far they are almost on the down hill run and only 6 weeks away from having bud and there for having mid to high grade weed&nbsp; . Only other time you see tips for sale is if a grower is desperate for cash ,a single tip is only going to be very small amount and worth only $5. If left for a further 6 weeks would have the potential to be worth $100 instead of $5 .As well tips dont have much thc and if they do have some thc the thc wont be mature enough to be potent .

				@inthedaytimewitha -- I was writing off the top of my head, and clarified my point in my second post.&nbsp; What I wrote was not &quot;completely wrong&quot;.&nbsp; I simply made it sound more monolithic than the MJ world actually is.&nbsp; I assumed everyone understands that the MJ world is a big mess, with lots of different strains that people call the same thing, and lots of strains that are simply NOT what people call them.&nbsp; Its really not important that I spell out everything in immaculate detail with each post?&nbsp; Obviously not EVERY bag of sour d you get everywhere in the world for all time will have been crossed with M39. I thought that was implied.&nbsp; Please give us the benefit of the doubt before hurling accusations of ignorance or incorrectness.&nbsp; I spent quite a bit of time trying to write a thoughtful response, and now find myself having to defend my rep against one word and one sentence accusations that I know nothing that I am writing about.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve not heard &quot;trips&quot; used in the US either, but I&#039;d venture a guess that it might be short for AAA, or &quot;triple A&quot;- level bud. MMJ dispensaries on the west coast and in canada seem to like to rate their bud on a scale in that manner; I never understood it and it seemed pretty objective, but that&#039;s just my $.02.

				@thinkinofvendor -- I&#039;d add one more thing.&nbsp; Never be afraid to ask people - especially vendors that you are about to transact business with -&nbsp; to speak plain English when you are discussing a deal.&nbsp; This is business with risk and not insignificant amounts of money and if they can&#039;t explain themselves intelligently to your satisfaction, given all the regional differences in slang &amp; lingo (I&#039;ve seen some just in this thread) I&#039;d take that as a caution.&nbsp; Sometimes people try to snow us with this kind of language, and its never inappropriate to ask them wtf they are saying :).

				Trips...never heard somebody say that before, but it sounds like a term some rookie smoker would come up for weed that is really psychedelic and heady, like a sativa strain. It is most likely used as a term for real good weed, like headies. That is what they call good weed in my area and culture, headies. Anybody else?

				Cannabis quality is 90% grow, 10% genetics.<br /><br />Strains are chosen by growers to get the most of something; most profit, most potency, best looks, quickest cropout, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;You cant judge weed by a vague description or some goofy retarded nickname given to a crossbreed grown by a specific person who thinks they have a custom strain.&nbsp; It just doesnt work that way<br /><br />You can have shwag, mid or top shelf M39, although the buzz profile and the fact that commercial growers are using this strain because it can flower in a month, usually puts it in the mids range.
