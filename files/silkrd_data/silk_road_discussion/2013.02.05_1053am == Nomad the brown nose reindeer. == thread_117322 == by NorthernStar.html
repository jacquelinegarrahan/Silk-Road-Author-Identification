				It has come to my attention the above mentioned is brown nosing DPR. He is crying because he has been here before us newbs and he isnt getting the respect he thinks he deserves ha! checky feckwitt<br /><br />I have some advice, you volunteered to brown nose, then you moan when people ask you questions, I have reported you to the admins for trying to extort BTC out of new members, which he thinks are erect members. And if you have all day to delete spam and go on a power trip, JOBSWORTH you are. Try and extort my friends again and watch what happens.

				What happened to Honest, Genuine, personable? ??? It&#039;s simple mate. Don&#039;t ask him any questions and don&#039;t give him any coins. It&#039;s a big place here, plenty of room for everyone. Surely you can steer clear of nomad if you feel this way. One thing champ, making threats is just plain stupid, especially on an anonymous Forum! ??? That is something that could have your account banned. :(

Oh yeah some halfwit fucktard with 2 weeks seat time pissing about another member. Sure we&#039;ll hear you out, but you might have to get in line and wait till someone opens up the line for &#039;gives a fuck&#039; which may be a while.<br /><br />Good luck on your travels on the &#039;Road, I&#039;ll be sure to add you to my list of people to avoid dealings with and relay the same.
