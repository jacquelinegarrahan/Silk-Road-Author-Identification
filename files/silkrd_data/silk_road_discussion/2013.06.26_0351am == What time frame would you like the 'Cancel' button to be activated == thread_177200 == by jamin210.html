				I think the button should be available immediately.<br /><br />There should be a mid-way option for vendors to mark orders as &quot;processing&quot; from &quot;placed&quot;, instead of it auto-processing. This would still allow vendors to mark orders in-transit when they are actually enroute. :P

				&nbsp;I personally think 48 hours is fair to cancel if it has not been shipped out. <br />1. Vendor should not be advertising product he does not have in stock<br />2. It should not take longer than 48 (except sunday, But even then they can be dropped in bluebox!) to get a product packaged and shipped.<br />3. BTC Fluctuation. If i had the money for the purchase when i made it and BTC drops then i cant afford the same product after an order is canceled 4 days later :/ <br />4. Maybe under certain circumstances IE&gt;. Order placed and no MSG&#039;s have been responded to. the SR can activate it after verifying no comms&#039; have been made on the vendors end. <br /><br />Just a few thoughts.

				i think 48 hours is more than fair , 4 days is far too long to wait , if a vendor cant put something in an envelope and post it in 48 hours , there is something far wrong . and they should not be a vendor . i have waited the 92 hours before i waited from the monday to the thursday , he put it in transit 2 hours before i could cancel then he must have waited the weekend and posted it monday , not right !

				I think that you should be able to cancel within a 24 hour time frame, if not immediately.&nbsp; Four days is obviously too long, and I doubt that anyone on the road, customers especially, like the way the cancel options works right now.&nbsp; If the SR staff did shorten the cancel option, I truly think that it would solve a lot of customer/seller issues.<br /><br />Great idea OP.<br /><br />+1

				I think 2 days is sufficient. However, if the vendor can confirm the order and thats its processing then its ok. I&#039;m not going to bust my ass and package my item stealth (which takes time) just to see someone changed their mind and cancelled. That would be unfair to vendors. So either implement a vendor acknowledgment/received button meaning its processing and then a shipped button - or just 2 days.<br /><br />I personally, confirm via private message with buyers when they order so they don&#039;t have to worry. Then ship same day and click confirm accordingly.
