				Been stalking the marketplace, wiki, and forums but I can&#039;t find any info on becoming a vender. I thought I heard something about auctioning. Can anyone offer advice? <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m a legal medical cannabis patient. I buy my seeds from Attitude seed bank and Seedbay (Cali Connection, Tom Hill, Subcool TGA, DNA Genetics, etc). I grow my plants outside in my organic garden and every harvest I end up with a few pounds more then I&#039;ll consume in a year. The local dispensaries are happy to buy it but I&#039;m not happy with their prices and I&#039;m to old to be working the streets. Im looking for a safe way to get rid of my surplus while making a better ROI then I can get locally.<br /><br />I got the shipping down by using 7.5 mil Mylar bags, heat sealed, plus I add humidity packs in with my bud to keep RH at 50%-55%, and I use oxygen absorbers. I got a few more tricks too but can&#039;t give away everything. I&#039;ll just say the buds are never compacted and shipping always looks professional. I would be using escrow too. None of that FE crap. <br /><br />I know there are already a lot of cannabis vendors already, but how many have TGA Vortex, Tom Hills Deep Chunk, or even good old California OG Kush? Or unprocessed hash from pulling leaves off the bud and rolling it into a nice perl sized ball.&nbsp; Except for editbles and concetrates,&nbsp; I mostly see inferior indoor hydro at crazy high end prices.

It&#039;s so members can send you encrypted messages and addresses when ordering. <br />It&#039;s very big for vendors to know exactly how PGP works! Go here for more info on PGP! http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.0<br /><br />That should be it for you :). It&#039;s a huge relief knowing you know how to successfully heatseal items while not compressing them before you even become a vendor on here. Huge plus!<br /><br />Welcome to the road and if you have any more questions feel free to ask ;D

				Good luck, you&#039;re in it for the right reasons and the strains sound delicious!<br />What I can recommend that hasn&#039;t been posted already is to check out existing vendors and find out what makes them successful. Personally I look for stealth shipping, competitive prices, unique strains and good communication.

				Hey MutherfuckerJones,<br /><br />Welcome to the forum. If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what country are you located in and will you ship Internationally? I&#039;m always interested in new bud strains.
