				A better way of determining turnover would be to go through the listings, count the number of reviews for each item in the last week. Would take a bloody age, but would far more accurate, omitting deleted listings and hidden listings of course.<br /><br />Don&#039;t see why it matters though. I think the SR employees, owners, &quot;members of the board&quot;, whatever, deserve every BTC cent they get from this business, because it&#039;s not just a business, it&#039;s a global pioneer, and a shape of what will surely come in the future.<br /><br />Although it&#039;s interesting seeing what the most popular products are.

The Road is commercial enterprise, it&#039;s a unique one but a commercial enterprise non-the-less. SR is basically a shopping mall in which we, the vendors rent digital space in which we can run our stores. That&#039;s it. The forum however I would class as a community to a certain extent although it&#039;s a community based on common interests which is justifiably right in this case. The forum is however a social place so naturally people get to know one another TO AN EXTENT and people form bonds. I think the problem is that people think that the community here which we are all a part of crosses over to SR and it gives them a feeling of ownership which is completely misguided. Like I said before we have absolutely no right to openly speculate on how much DPR makes just like nobody has the right to openly speculate on how much a vendor makes. It&#039;s nobodies business but theirs because it is after all THEIR business which we are lucky enough to be able to use. I would have thought that people would show more respect for those that do so much for us. From my own standpoint on this if I saw people publicly speculating on how much I was making they&#039;d get both barrels there and then and I&#039;d probably contact the admin about it. <br /><br />Boundaries people, boundaries.

				That figure is likely to be an overestimate, with plenty of alias/non-purchasing/non-active accounts.<br /><br />But what lim said, it makes no difference to me. At the end of the day, if I&#039;m high, I&#039;m good.<br /><br />It&#039;s&nbsp; a shame more buyers don&#039;t use the forum though. Even when a product is openly defamed on the boards, plenty of people still buy it. The forums are the ideal way of getting decent vendors more custom.

DPR looks after our interests, he don&#039;t cheat us and his rules and restrictions are fair. The day that stops being the case then yeah, as consumers you have the right to get answers to issues. Until that happens though (which I doubt will happen) the only thing ya need to think is god-speed to SR, that&#039;s all I think. <br /><br />And I am guessing that response translates to &quot;Because I have nothing better to do with my time than to gossip about things that don&#039;t concern me&quot; then.

				Wiki the 1% rule (90-9-1 rule) and you can gather a pretty good idea of how many people actually use SR. It states that the 1% created the website (give them a hug when you see them, ok?), 9% contribute to the website (all of us chatting away on the forums and who actually have forum accounts), and 90% of those who lurk (the ones who use SR but don&#039;t contribute to the forums).<br /><br />So if there&#039;s 23,000 subscribers in the forum, then there&#039;s an estimated 2.4 million users who have at one time or another logged onto SR and bought some drugs. That makes us the largest &quot;drug cartel&quot; in the world and probably one of the most diverse communities as well. <br /><br />Maybe if we could pull resources together we could end this persecution of drug users so we can go about our lives in peace...I will no longer tolerate the back seat of the bus!<br /><br />...I hope I did this right&nbsp; &nbsp;::)

				I think everyone pulling together to do anything but buy better drugs is a bad thing. &quot;Movements&quot;, no matter how small, will attract more attention to SR. Not to mention that people will obviously always disagree on the sentiment, apart from the distribution of drugs, that&#039;s exactly what we&#039;re here for. :p<br /><br />You can empower yourself and the rest of the community by being responsible, considerate, and by buying lots of drugs, nothing else. That&#039;s how SR will continue, and become a larger force.<br /><br />Or maybe I&#039;m talking shit because I&#039;m baked...
