				Extremely frustrated right now as I genuinely forgot my PIN after setting it all that time ago. I&#039;m about to purchase something and then BOOM what is my PIN? I can&#039;t fucking remember and now I have to wait A WEEK before I can buy anything because some idiots get phished and now we need all this stupid extra security. Is there any god damn way for me to avoid waiting one week?! This is so annoying I cannot explain. If I have to wait a week before I get my drugs I will end up punching a baby in the face to relief my stress. URGH.

				Why would I add Bitcoins to my account and then 2 minutes later make a purchase if I had stolen the account?! This is ridiculous. Each case should be judged on its own merits, not just a &quot;everyone has to wait 7 days&quot; rule. I am really disappointed and frustrated at SilkRoad - this is just not how you manage a high traffic website.

				Yeah, I&#039;m in the same boat and I agree it&#039;s rather frustrating, but the policy is there to protect our accounts from phishers.&nbsp; You gotta look at it big picture and accept the fact that its BECAUSE of the traffic here that leaves SR without the time/resources/desire to weigh each case on its individual merits.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to wait any more than you do, but I&#039;m going to just like you are.&nbsp; Deal.<br /><br />All you can do, really.

I don&#039;t have to use a website that has this absolute farce of a security measure. Some idiot gets phished and now I have to wait a fucking week to do anything, because of this utterly fucking ridiculous irrational bullshit &quot;security measure&quot;. After being a member of SR for 8 months I feel like I have now been shit on by the owner, the moderators and anyone in a position of power, they just don&#039;t care unless you&#039;re donating Bitcoins to them for doing absolutely fucking nothing.

				Okay you are obviously pissed off, and I would be too if I was in your situation. I was almost in the same boat as you a few days I ago when I remembered I wrote down my PIN somewhere on a piece of paper in my wallet. Thank god my high mind was smart enough to do this when I was prompted to make a password a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do, in a way it is your fault for not remembering the password you set. It&#039;s not SRs responsibility to remember it, but it is their responsibility in keeping their customers safe. Next time please just write it down in a safe place.
