				Good greeting SilkRoad (SR),<br /><br />I’m an Australian drug enthusiast hoping to make some literate sense of a few things that I have noticed. Now, I know I’m a “newb” and only have 4 posts at the time of this, but I have been on the forums for nearly a year now and only signed up so I could write a trip report for a wonderful substance I purchased here. Furthermore, my buyer stats only show I have made 3 purchases, with 2 more in transit at this moment in time but the beautifully double edged effect of the internet means that any ole Joe n’ Larry can have their opinion published, and what selfish jerk wouldn’t take advantage of that?<br />Drugs alter state of mind or body, or both, and the reason I love this so much is simple, why not explore every state of consciousness and therefore alter the angles at which we can be thrown through at. Sounding slightly deranged…..perhaps, but for all studying engineers out there, the only way to solve a problem, is to solve it three or four times before picking out the correct right answer. <br /><br />This is actually a little off topic, what actually got my ears pricked is politics. A very boring and invasive topic, but my country, which I love, is in one of the greatest possible circumstances in the world, and politicians, as educated as they are (or aren’t) spend all their time increasing wages for themselves and trying to piss on each other to make themselves look better to the public. Two things come to me, where is all the money for their wages coming from? And why do they think the public cares so much? As for the latter mentioned thought, I conducted a survey during my time in high school, asking people amongst other things, “If it weren’t compulsory, would you still vote?” and not surprisingly, less than 10 % would. More importantly, less than 20% of that population could notice a change in political leaders as long as they have been alive and in this country. So where does this new found sense of self-worth come from amongst the leaders? Drugs? Sometimes. Greed?&nbsp; Pughhh…….. Yeah!! But more importantly the self-delusion that they can not only Piddle with the PM, but also to mingle with the everyday people, and this consequently, is the mind process of the local cunts sorry I mean police. I love punk music, maybe a little punkish myself, but I don’t question an unquestionable authority and I don’t riot without reason for riot, but I don’t lie down and let another dog lick my jatz. I have been In trouble with the cops before, a few times I was speeding, paid my fines (over 1600$ total), got caught smoking dope at a music festival (shit! 450$ fine) and so with just two offenses, paid enough money that would cover my ganja needs for 20 months. And then there are the unjust fines, 400$ for fog lights, 600$ for no seat belt (which I had on), 270$ for using my phone (which I wasn’t on) and my P plate was askew by 180 degrees, so I was a dork and not provisional, another 350$, and that was in one sitting! 2 cars filled with 8 cops started having a go at me and searching my car because I was dressed funny, I was going to my gig where I was supposed to play and help set up another 3 bands. Instead, I was teased, humiliated and picked on by 8 guys who were clearly mad they weren’t doing anything better on a Thursday night. Other things my mates have been caught with include opening a vodka bottle in a shopping centre, swearing, spitting, being loud and all these running at least 180$ fines. In typing this, I can see where all the polie’s be getting there money from.<br /><br />The federal Police are not that different, scare tactics and over the top surveillance using government resources so nothing nasty comes into this country. Our consequence? Shit drugs at a high price, and anyone who has been to Australia and another country will agree. 30 dollars for a pill that probably won’t work? Fuck, better take 4 so something happens, not a nice one pill one trip mentality, and let me tell you, just because it’s harder for drugs to enter the country, it doesn’t make them rare, they are so easy to find, because there so wanted, some people are selling aspirin in little baggies to make a buck. The sheer amount of products seized by customs is worth billions, but nothing compared to what we are spending on border security, and in having these dense systems in place, we greatly alter travel times of these packages and products purchased from overseas, and means our youths (and oldies) are ingesting more shit than they should. It has been said over and over that when someone is used to taking shit, might need 4 or 5 doses to get something, if they got real drugs it may become dangerous very quickly. However I’m not here to ramble about legalising drugs, in fact I would prefer they remain illegal. Some people shouldn’t ever trip, or smoke a meth pipe you know? I was taught nothing about drugs as a kid, and most of my over indulgences comes from curiosity, but I’m relatively responsible and intelligent so I can take appropriate measures. How about someone else? More impressionable, like my brother who has trouble fitting in, and I hate his fucking guts right now, but he has fried himself on drugs and he isn’t even 21 yet. When the feds read this, how about “a little less conversation and a little more action please”? In short, fuck drugs coming in and teach the kids about them, you’re not going to make drugs disappear but you can ensure you have given the population a fighting chance.<br /><br />As with most of my literature, I just ramble and then scramble to make everything come together at the end like two leopard slugs mating (google that shit!). After assessing everything and everyone on SR, I realise more and more that this is a growing community, with most people happy to buy and sell under the rules, honestly. And then you might get the occasional wanker who thinks they can scam a trusting vendor into reships, or refunds by lying and manipulating. This system of ours is like any community, the greedier the inhabitants, the more paranoid everyone is and the more they look after themselves. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the way every country online can co-exist in harmony, and I think it gives the real life something to aim for. What no one wants to see is us taking a leaf out of real life’s book of wisdom. All I’m asking is everyone obeys they fact that this service was not created by any of us; hence we shouldn’t take matters into our own hands. Yes this is the internet, and yes, it’s against the law what we are all doing, but we created our own laws and we should follow them, they are for our safety, protection, and more importantly, THEY ARE SELLING KICK ASS DRUGS! Cheaper, safer and with a greater range than the dickhead with dreadies at your local music venue.<br /><br /><br />In short, we are a Niche market functioning as a living, developing entity, and the success is in all of our hands. Keep shit simple and just because you can say whatever you want, don’t. Because people that mind mattering, don’t really matter in the long run and we don’t want you here and we are too busy listening to an opinion that does.<br />FREE TIBET!<br />

At the very least kids should get real education about drugs. Here in the states we have a program where a police officer comes in and talks to kids in 4th grade (about 9 years old) every week for a couple months. That&#039;s pretty much just &quot;drugs are bad don&#039;t do them&quot;. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know why people think that telling kids not to do something will fix the problem. When you tell kids that sex is bad and they shouldn&#039;t do it until marriage, you get all the dumbass rumors like &quot;she can&#039;t get pregnant if you fuck standing up&quot;. Same thing applies to drugs, just instead of getting pregnant, people die
