				Some people are screaming scam, I think it&#039;s a bit odd that &quot;she&quot; pulled out of everything.&nbsp; My theory is that LE or someone got way too close and she pulled everything for her safety (that would be the &quot;she&#039;s still an awesome vendor&quot; approach to it all&quot;.&nbsp; If we all don&#039;t get our packages in a few weeks we got duped one way or another and she&#039;s got a ton of bitcoins at our expense.&nbsp; It&#039;s just another never FE lesson.&nbsp; I&#039;m viewing it as a whatever considering I got one of those lucky &quot;extra&quot; packages from Dutch.&nbsp; Karma can be a bitch ;)

Where the hell did she go? Did she say anything to anyone? She seemed so pleasant and ready to stick around here for a LONG ASS TIME! Didn&#039;t she have 100% feedback from over 100+ transactions? She was a great vendor...&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a feeling that LEO had some Bloodhounds on her ass and right before they got to taste what she ate the night before last, she burned her harddrives and got the fuck outta Dodge... Like the intelligent bloody British girl she was... She had to avoid those damned blimey authorities. :)&nbsp; I just hope she got out okay and also got my my package out because otherwise I&#039;m out $700 bucks... Hey... on the bright side, if she was a scamming piece of shit, at least I wasn&#039;t fucked out of thousands of dollars... Still, however, I have a feeling something happened to her and that she got to safety; I bet I will get my package in a week or so.. ::crosses fingers::

				Made my first ever order with foxbelle a few weeks ago and went great.&nbsp; One thing though was the packaging was VERY basic, not stealthy at all (heard she had improved it recently though), so LE may have caught up with her.. :/<br /><br />Hope all turns out good!

Like on myself, I have been dealing it for a long time (3 years) and have probably indulged in it about 15-20 times each year and 200mg is still a decent dose for me. <br /><br />It&#039;s sad to see Foxbelle go, but I suppose it means more customers for me&nbsp; 8) haha.

				I think you are giving her too much credit for being &quot;honest.&quot; I don&#039;t think LE had anything to do with this. She was a scammer, point-blank period. A good scammer at that, but still a piece of shit. She gave out extremely generous samples and overweight packages with suspiciously low prices at first to get her feedback/reputation up. Then, she makes everyone finalize early because of &quot;buyers scamming her.&quot; <br /><br />She got into our heads with the whole &quot;I&#039;m a girl, so I&#039;m perfect and honest&quot; bullshit and a lot of us fell for it. And once she got to the point where she had hundreds of people finalizing early based on the fact that they trusted her, she took all our money and ran. <br /><br />I originally thought that this could possibly have something to do with LE, until I saw that some buyers (including myself) were given the exact same tracking number... An honest person doesn&#039;t do that no matter how many &quot;bloodhounds&quot; they have on their ass. We got fucked, that&#039;s it. All of you who placed an order with &quot;her&quot; earlier and actually got your packages, consider yourselves really fucking lucky. &#039;Cause now a lot of us are out of A LOT of money.
