				I understand he is liberal but being so liberal people are allowed to be totally open without any security risking other peoples lives is too liberal.<br />This must be thought through again, minimum safety should always be priority.<br /><br />We must protect ourselves to keep this freedom we have here.<br />Vendors especially must be educated not to risk their own and others freedom by being lazy.

				This is apparently how SR wants things to be. To be honest I think DPR needs a good shake and splash w cold water over this whole war on drugs, quantity over quality crap.&nbsp; I thought bringing mailorder drug sales public was to eliminate the shady situations drug users often get themselves into. I was wrong, obviously.

However, based on previous threads where this issue was discussed, I doubt anything will change any time soon, if at all. In the meantime, we as individuals should ask the relevant questions prior to placing an order with a vendor. If you like their responses, give them a go. If your skeptical of their replies, buy elsewhere.

				Wadozo is pretty much spot on with this.&nbsp; The marketplace was set up under the principles of a free market and with that it self governs itself.&nbsp; All of your complaints are clearly addressed in the sites rules and sellers guides. There are certain things that the staff will act on but it is impossible and against all of the founding beliefs to police the marketplace to the point of total control. <br /><br />The reason this market exists is because it allows the freedoms that make it possible for you or anyone to buy some of the items sold there.&nbsp; It would be contradictory to act against it.&nbsp; You have the freedom of choice because we don&#039;t control the market, and one of those freedoms include the ability to buy or not buy something.&nbsp; That risk falls upon you, and the staff does not control that.&nbsp; We do our best to protect you but we can&#039;t control every vendor.

				I think this is why you need to read your vendors profile.&nbsp; &nbsp;They should address enough of those issues as to not incriminate themselves, while giving you some reassurance.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Example- You order weed, and it shows up just stuffed into a envelope in a regular baggie.&nbsp; &nbsp;You then read on the vendor&#039;s profile - &quot;i ship my weed in shitty plastic bags&quot;,&nbsp; whose fault is it you are unhappy?&nbsp; &nbsp;Im not trying to be a asshole.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I just think this is risky enough you should not order from someone who does not appear professional.&nbsp; And have strict protocol.&nbsp; After that it requires a little faith/ trust i guess.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I hope im not just ranting.&nbsp; Thx<br />

				Let&#039;s be realistic for a second. <br /><br />There are theoretically quite a few security holes in Silkroad, and there are plenty of vendors that use less than safe methods of shipping and communication. But this has been going on for over 3 years, and besides that arrest in Australia (that I&#039;m not even convinced was directly traceable to Silkroad), I&#039;m not aware of any serious legal problems resulting from SR.<br /><br />The truth is, only local law enforcement will harass small time buyers, and local law enforcement does not have the ability to catch people through Tor. Those that buy and sell very large amounts are in danger from the federal government, but honestly, if they get caught, it will be because they&#039;re also selling large amounts of drugs in real life.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to say that we shouldn&#039;t always be trying to beef up security, but at this point, it&#039;s mostly fear mongering.

				@ OP, <br /><br />leave SR now. You&#039;ve probably just scratched the surface of potential issues. <br /><br />The first thing you have to understand about SR is that it&#039;s anonymous. There is no way to enforce anything you listed. None. If you come up with something, someone will come up with a way around it.

You&#039;ve probably just scratched the surface of potential issues. <br /><br />The first thing you have to understand about SR is that it&#039;s anonymous. There is no way to enforce anything you listed. None. If you come up with something, someone will come up with a way around it. You&#039;re not comfortable with the level of risk inherent in an anonymous marketplace. Source your DOC on your own. <br /><br />And it&#039;s not &quot;liberal&quot; it&#039;s &quot;libertarian.&quot; There&#039;s a world of difference between the two.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Exactly! totally agree! no one is guaranteeing your safety or anything else on here. It is up to you <br />as a consumer to stay informed and up to date to keep yourself safe! it is still illegal<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />He&#039;s very worried about maintaining the freedom that we all have here, but if you&#039;re obsessing about security this much, then you&#039;re not really free, are you...?

Let me assure you, Shadh1 was an SR vendor in Aus who was arrested as a direct result of his SR activities (all started with ordering many packages to his home address which were seized). He co-operated with the AFP and gave them full access to his SR vendor&#039;s account, even demonstrating how he used it. These details can be found here -<br /><br />http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/trafficker-jailed-over-online-drug-supermarket-bust-20130206-2dxgu.html.<br /><br />There have been a number of busts around the world related to selling on SR. One that comes to mind is MoveItNice, a Canadian vendor caught by using WU to do out of Escrow transactions. LE found more than 200grams packaged and ready to go at the local post office and over half a kilo of Coke at a home he shared with his family.

				previous experience is key !!&nbsp; i received&nbsp; &nbsp;a slab of hash from one of sr top vendors&nbsp; over 300 transactions ! it was like a vhs tape in a paper envelope&nbsp; i shit myself could not believe it made it !!&nbsp; and then got fantastic stealth from a vendor with&nbsp; only 56 transactions&nbsp; so i cant see how it can be regulated?&nbsp; and also on quite a lot of the vendor pages it says&#039;&nbsp; stealth now upgraded.or new stealth&#039;&#039;&nbsp; so it seems being pro comes with experience&#039; my best security is to stick with vendors&nbsp; that provide the service im happy with ;D&nbsp; <br /><br />or maybe a sr hit squad to fuck up&nbsp; anyone who aint pro?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />would be nice though knowing that all details are auto destroyed straight away ?&nbsp; lol<br /><br />fuck there will be a union next. hahaha

				SR provides the platform. You provide the security. Trusting SR to protect you from idiot/malicious vendors is as foolish as trusting any other unknown 3rd party site. <br /><br />Dont get me wrong. I &lt;3 DPR, but SR&#039;s security practices are out of my hands &amp; thus not something I&#039;d want to place bets on, esp if it involves my personal freedom. Plus isn&#039;t the OP&#039;s post an insult to the original principles of the site? SR is about individual freedoms, not collective security. Value collective security above individual liberty and you end up with the NSA. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
