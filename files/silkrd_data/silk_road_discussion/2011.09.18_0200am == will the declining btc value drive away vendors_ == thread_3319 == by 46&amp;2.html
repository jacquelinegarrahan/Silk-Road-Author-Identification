				there is a large market for use of the btc other than this venue, but, with this venue thriving, would the feds decide to mine the hell out of btc mountains to devalue, thus, achieving containment on this venue to deter such activity? <br />&nbsp;<br />with a theory of infinite possible coins to be mined, it&#039;s value could take the same route as Zimbabwe&#039;s currency.<br /><br />this avenue of payment is more cost effective for buyers and a little easier to translate back to mainstream currencies for vendors, so, i just hope the value we are seeing right now is the worst of the plunge.<br />

				yes, this is about the worst it has plunged and it is destroying me as a vendor. every other vendor understands me i&#039;m very sure of that :)<br /><br />the approach of feds mining btc themselves is debatable however, as the amount of total bitcoins is not infinite and hardcoded into the btc itself.<br /><br />this is done specifically to thwart unfair advantages in mining, as is the block / chain difficulty.<br /><br />correct me if i&#039;m wrong with this answer, but this is what i gathered from OP.<br /><br />i&#039;m not sure fed/nsa would take this type of approach as it would be too time consuming.<br /><br /><br />regards,<br />L75<br /><br />

				high market volatility could drive away sellers, stable market will only get more sellers to SR, regrdles of the BTC/$ ratio...<br />And&nbsp; the more people are in Bitcoin the market will be less volatile

				I am sticking around. &quot;BTC hits a nickle.&quot; I am not going to rush to any conclusions. The BTC is volitile. It may go back ^ to $8 tomorrow. We all have seen some crazy things. I&#039;m not in a rush to leave

				The volatility sure doesn&#039;t help the margins, and I&#039;m sad to see sellers go (from a community perspective.&nbsp; From a competition perspective I think I&#039;m allright with it......).&nbsp; That being said, my f2f business is more than enough to subsidize a few lower-margin or breakeven transactions and keep my rep going.<br /><br />I see this as a ground floor opportunity in a new type of crypto-anarchic industry that helps to supercede the state and brings peaceful people together.&nbsp; It&#039;s something I strongly believe in philosophically and morally in my real life, so this just makes sense to me.&nbsp; Not that i would be here if I were losing money, but i&#039;m clearing enough to justify the time and the community is great.&nbsp; I want this thing to grow and grow and have a dozen clones in a year or two.&nbsp; Worldwide.&nbsp; Hell, SR should franchise out specialty sites for prostitution, arms sales, etc.<br /><br />Onwards and upwards, I say!

				The profits are miniscule when compared from the joy we get from serving such a community.<br /><br />I clearly remember dreaming about such a futuristic community that believe in true freedom to choose what they wish to put into their body.<br /><br />To be part of the dream is payment enough.... :)

				it hurt, but partly due to not having a good &#039;out&#039; for bitcoins. <br /><br />any suggestions?<br /><br />it&#039;s been a bit of debate as of late on staying. it&#039;s certainly not for profit but for tje revolution! viva la silk riad!<br /><br />
