				I see that bitcoin value is down about 30% in the last week. <br /><br />Is this likely to affect purchases that are in escrow?<br /><br />Is it always so unstable or is this related to the MT Gox snafu?

				Last 2 month bitcoin was unstable because various reasons. Before that period btc was stable 10$-12$. It will return to that rate soon and be stable again.<br />Its good to know how news have impact to market so we can speculate and even maybe have some profit from it.

				On average, I have lost 25 percent and counting. Thats huge to me. I just want it to be stable.&nbsp; My wife is already bitchin saying &quot;I told you so&quot;... She wouldn&#039;t be bitchin if it gone up 25 percent. I held off selling because I didn&#039;t think that the btc was stable enough. so, when it hovered around 16 for a few days, I thought I was ok.... Guess It wasn&#039;t. I know some sellers will cancel the orders but I think that is bad business. Take the bad with the good. I just hope that the sliding stops. This is getting rediculous.

				The problem is the massive fluxuations in betwen product shipping and the receiver confirming shipment has arrived.&nbsp; In 3-5 days times btc value can fluxuate so wildly.

				The other problem is we are still at the front-end of BTC.&nbsp; There is a very small concentration of people who were mining in the old days who have huge loads of BTC and are trying to move them off to USD&#039;s or EUR.&nbsp; That&#039;s why there has been a decent cap on price jumps and once the price dives start they seems to roll pretty hard.&nbsp; If you check the market depth there are some very huge orders (multiple x 10k USD) waiting out there.<br /><br />Once more of these coins are sold out to smaller buyers, I think the major price jumps will drop.&nbsp; More media attention, though, will swing the price up.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about BTC long-term as one or two of the glaring requirements for true market money can only be met by making a huge leap.&nbsp; But I&#039;m holding a portion of mine in case there is some serious appreciation and cashing out the rest and washing it as it comes in.&nbsp; We will see how it all plays out.

				Or, as has been suggested often, post prices in dollars, and then should have a way to click, and get the latest tradehill (or MtGox) value in btc.&nbsp; shouldn&#039;t be that hard to automate, and this would save sellers and buyers both, having to be enslaved to a new currency.&nbsp;

				To counter the uncertainty we have from btc we ask for a premium price on SR. Im making about 30% more then I would on the streets, so the btc going down hurts me ofcourse but not so much.

				I agree being on the front end and getting a good customer base is a great opportunity.&nbsp; There will be highs and lows, but even then.... BTC have already appreciated by $3.00 since yesterday.<br /><br />Hell, I am able to sell international for the first time in my entire history of this business!&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty cool.
