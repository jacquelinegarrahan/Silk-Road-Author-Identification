				I went to the SR site today and I got this message:<br />&quot;We are terribly sorry for the outages over the past couple of days. Please see our post about it on the forums.&quot;<br />Then I click on the link and it doesn&#039;t link me to the post.<br />What&#039;s going on?

				Come on Eptile, be nice.. Yes, it was sarcasm, but it was funny..... Its been down for days. it was up for a very short time but then down again... Who knows whats going on...<br /><br />I just hope he figures it out quick.<br /><br />Dont fall for any phishing scams, where someone will post &quot;Silk road is up, here is the new address&quot; you sign in with your SR credentials, and when SR is up, they go in and wipe you out..<br /><br />Dont Go to any address but the original address and bookmark it. If the address would ever change, Silk road would come on here himself, it says :&quot;administrator&quot; under his name and its red. there is a guy thats gos buy silk_road and has been putting up phising threads, I have probably deleted 10 or so. I think SR banned him, but he made a new account with the same name... I dont think I have the power to ban, but im trying to figure that out, <br /><br />Just dont do any thing til the original site is up an running and never give your username password out to anyone. if you have fallen for the scam, just change your password the second SR is back up..
