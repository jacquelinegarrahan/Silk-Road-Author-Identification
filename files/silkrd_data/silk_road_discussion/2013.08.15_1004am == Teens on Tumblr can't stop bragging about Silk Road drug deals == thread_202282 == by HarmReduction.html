				By Patrick Howell O&#039;Neill on August 14, 2013 Email<br />Silk Road, the Dark Web drug marketplace made famous in 2011, is a global success. It&#039;s doing tens of millions dollars in business every year. New customers walk in every day.<br /><br />Silk Road is so successful at this point that teenagers are flooding in to take advantage of the easy-to-use black market. Some Silk Road users are indistinguishable from kids in a candy store, so excited by their new mind-altering purchases that they hurry to post pictures and descriptions to Tumblr.<br /><br />For young people in 2013, oversharing is a given. But uploading evidence that you bought drugs from an anonymous black market is, well, an odd choice. <br /><br />Silk Road’s ultimate goal is to create a world where you don’t have to hide the fact that you enjoy recreational drug use. But let’s face the facts: We don’t live in that world right now. Novel-length guides to anonymity and security have been written by Silk Roaders in an effort to stop law enforcement from ever identifying vendors or buyers.<br /><br />Who needs all that? Let’s tweet about our new 50 grams of ecstasy!<br /><br />Meet Alec, a 17-year-old from Michigan who goes by “2cool4u.” He ordered DMT, a powerful psychedelic drug, from Silk Road in May and was so pleased with his purchase that he blogged about it. It’s hard to blame Alec if he made the post when he was high as a kite. But it’s been four months now, and the post remains up as a monument to his illegal activity. He’s left a selfie in the top left just to make the job that much easier for anyone who wants to identify him.<br /><br />The rest if the article and pictures are on (clear web ) http://www.dailydot.com/crime/tumblr-teens-silk-road-drug-deals/

				I&#039;ve heard of low-lying fruit but holy shit, these dumbass kids are certainly making LE&#039;s job tremendously easy.&nbsp; The more intelligent and careful users here are worried about keeping up with constant browser updates, safe drops, PGP usage, demanding high stealth of the vendors... while these other ones are taking &quot;selfies&quot; with their party favors, proclaiming where it came from on the clearnet. The lack of thought is mindblowing.

				the elephant sitting in the living room - while the Forbes article might have been some good publicity (after all, it&#039;s readership isn&#039;t 14-18 yr olds), it probably generated some additional motivation on LE&#039;s part to break SR&#039;s security<br /><br />this kind of publicity will generate tons more motivation as well as congressional pressure under the guise of &quot;IT&#039;S FOR THE CHILDREN&quot;<br /><br />just saying

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously you can&#039;t stop them, nor should we try. What young people choose to do with their bodies is a fundamental right of theirs, as much as ours. If there was some massive cultural change, and we didn&#039;t have to worry about criminalisation, then I may support restricting activities dependent on differing levels of maturity, but arbitrary age restrictions are simplistic, idiotic even.

				I am not for anyone using drugs before their brain has developed fully (even though the brain is so ever changing you can argue it&#039;s never done developing). I would not sell to anyone below 20 if I could. Weed is a different story as it is more benign, but the more psycho active substances are a big deal and should not be used by those not mature enough to make that decision. With that said kids are stupid and are going to do what they want no matter what.

They all are young, probably don&#039;t have extensive police records or violent pasts, and most likely were not on SR for too long or moving too much product before they Hoover&#039;d themselves. <br />Some of these kids may end up in jail for short-term sentences, and i do empathize with them but they brought it on their own. <br /><br />If the feds spend all their time locating, building a case and prosecuting the newbies who are basically volunteering to go down then that means the more secure SR members who aren&#039;t flashing pics all over Social media will be safer. <br /><br />When i fish, i want the fish that comes to me...<br />LE is fishing, and these newbie kids are swimming right into the net.

				Although I disagree with children doing drugs on principles.&nbsp; I am no hypocrite those kids that are smart enough to make it on here need to be somehow reached out to and taught how to be smart about all this.&nbsp; The technology at our finger tips grants all of us a lot of power, and I feel that without a proper understanding and respect of this technology a lot of damage can be done.&nbsp; By technology I mean all the the forces that have come together to make the road a special place: drugs, money, encryption, the postal system of first world nations, etc.&nbsp; Regardless of our personal opinions about children, they are our future lets help them not to be retards.&nbsp; It would seem that the ones who make it here and are able to purchase bitcoins might be a tad brighter than there peers?&nbsp; One could definitely have their bright future screwed up by not understanding all the implications of stepping into this game.&nbsp; The enemy surely is playing hard and has no trouble destroying the young and using them to justify its goals.&nbsp; Guys think of the children.&nbsp; We as responsible adults need to protect the kids from the tyranny of the government, lets try and keep the little bastards out of jail.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I&#039;m super active on the site. But I&#039;m not a tween.<br /><br />Right now, the silkroad tag is filled with DPR groupies and links to the forbes article. Then there are things like &#039;I kinda want to try cocaine&#039; and &#039;can anyone tell me how to put money in my SR wallet?&#039;<br /><br />Actually, back when I was reading the posts, there were so many confused people that I figured the process must be super difficult.

				If teenagers want drugs, they will find them. SR only simplifies the process and actually makes it safer. I had to literally buy drugs on the streets in some very dangerous neighborhoods, where I wasn&#039;t always sure about the quality. It exposed me to certain criminal elements which I probably never would have&nbsp; had otherwise. I was also limited to the type of drugs which I could buy, which were much more addictive than what I would have settled for. <br /><br />I certainly do not advocate teenagers using drugs, but if they are looking to experiment a little, it is much better for them to come looking here than on the streets.

My parents, school, teachers, and pretty much every adult in my life lied to me. That has a bit of a drastic effect on a kid. Though, I&#039;m an off case - I turn every adventure into a research project, which is ultimately how I came to understand the bullshit that was being served to me.<br /><br />The education principal is completely off kilter, and needs an overhaul. We have too much of a distanced extreme within the gap of beliefs. The power of experimentation is epic, as it is probably the single best way for any one person to understand anything. That is unfortunately, the truth... and we ourselves say this all the time, when we get angry at those who judge us without the knowledge to do so.<br /><br />That being said, look at what SR is: we have refined our ways to the point of near perfection. For any kid who wants, a simple search on this forum and a few hours of research will yield every avenue for receiving mail with, or without, an adult ever knowing.<br /><br />So, where am I going with this. Protecting kids, sheltering them, is nice when they are younger, but when preparing them for the real world I&#039;d say its probably better to actually prepare them, rather than try and make it inaccessible/non existent. These kids are excited BECAUSE they are rebelling. They are showing the world that they have beaten their system, that the man couldn&#039;t keep them down. Isn&#039;t that essentially what we are doing ourselves, except we are doing so for our own freedoms? I&#039;m reminded of Nick Naylor from &quot;Thank You For Smoking.&quot; During the senatorial disposition, the senator from virginia spitefully asks how Nick would feel if his son started smoking. He very point blank said, &quot;If he really wants a cigarette, I&#039;ll buy him his first pack.&quot;<br /><br />That is a pretty profound thing to do, especially when the media would just as easily wish us to believe that smoking a single cigarette kills 10 babies and throws kittens out of windows into a burning pool of napalm.<br /><br />And what about beer?<br /><br />Yea, heroin and shit have a pretty nasty chemical addiction and it can easily get out of hand. In the end, why did it get out of hand?<br /><br />Now I&#039;m not saying I&#039;ll hand my son his first stamp bag, hell no, that&#039;d be ludicrous. But, I will explain to him the difference between movies and real life. Because, thats what this is all really about, right? As a kid, I saw pot cause ridiculous hallucinations and stupid acts of idiocy. I saw cocaine bring women and fun. I saw heroin bring orgasms and bliss. And then at school, and the other adults in my life, and DARE education, I saw that touching it made you a low life scumbag with 6 kids and a prison sentence... snorting cocaine gives you aids... doing ecstacy makes you stupid.... heroin turns you into a prostitute.<br /><br />Which example, is the right one there?<br /><br />Now, as for these tumblr kids. There really is not any way to prevent this, though tumblr could possibly help us out by removing the content (which, as far as I can recall, they have done in the past for certain things - depending on what is actually demonstrated in the photo.) The issues with outing vendors and their methods is definitely an issue, but all the same while we can all believe we are creative there is only so many ways to skin a chicken - you are only as unique as you believe you are. LE doesn&#039;t need someone to buy from you to know that someone has bought from you before - that information and what you sell is already on the site. Unless the idiot on tumblr knows anything more about you than is displayed on SR, no more information than would previously be available is made available, except maybe your creativity in packaging.<br /><br />Just because they know the packaging, doesn&#039;t make the USPS any smarter or any better funded.

				hey offbeatadam, I think we essentially agree, I just thought I&#039;d point that out :)<br /><br />I know my arguments sound like someone who would be coming from the &quot;We need to prevent kids from accessing SR&quot; camp.&nbsp; I assure you I am 100% not in that camp, lol.&nbsp; I am in the parents need to be better parents camp, and we also need to legalize drugs so that SR doesn&#039;t have to exist, and so that comprehensive research, education, and harm reduction programs are the *standard* in society.<br /><br />So that is where we disagree, I think, because I do not believe SR is ideal or perfect in any way.&nbsp; Imagine if you had to buy your groceries, or your beer, through SR.&nbsp; That would fucking suck.&nbsp; &nbsp;Buying groceries isn&#039;t even ideal with all the shit that surrounds big agro, non-gmos, pesticides, etc.. but it&#039;s a lot better of a system than SR is that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; And yes, I do believe some day that&#039;s what it will be like... you&#039;ll go to the store, get whatever you want essentially (with some restrictions, not just age limits but perhaps licenses, counseling, etc..)<br /><br />So this system, it&#039;s not perfect by any means.&nbsp; It&#039;s only better than what we&#039;ve had to deal with in the past few decades.&nbsp; But it still puts drug use in the shadows, it still funds violent cartels, and the information on here about drugs is NOT ideal for someone just learning the ropes.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read more misinformation here than other forums that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; I also find myself reading what I want to read -- look up a vendor, and look for the positive reports, and take them as if I trust the person giving it.&nbsp; Who knows who that person is?&nbsp; Maybe they would be the last person on earth I would trust if I actually met the fucker.&nbsp; Teenagers project even more than this, all kinds of things onto the words they read!&nbsp; &nbsp;That is a part of growing up in today&#039;s society that a lot of adult&#039;s have a hard time relating to, they probably hardly realize their own projections let alone the projections of a young person&#039;s mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;But the difference is clear when you look at how pedos lure kids into meeting them, they are much more vulnerable.&nbsp; If they WANT to believe something, and some asshole just happens to jokingly state it, they will find validation in their beliefs.&nbsp; They can think me or you is a Professor of Health or a stupid junkie, and will likely get it wrong 9 times out of 10.&nbsp; So that vulnerability is there and it shouldn&#039;t be taken lightly.<br /><br /><br />

I don&#039;t think it will ever be the case. Things will change, there is no doubt about that... but I&#039;m not ready to believe that freedom is around a corner after a few more dark alleys. SR isn&#039;t perfect, but its there. We can go to walmart and buy guns, but we have to go to extreme ends to enjoy ourselves. SR will never be perfect or ideal, but there will always be a need for an SR. In the future it may not be for drugs, but you never know: you may need to one day buy groceries through SR. You may one day have to buy butter through SR because the state banned it and hoarded it for themselves and their morning toast. <br /><br />But like you say, even buying groceries isn&#039;t ideal. Nothing is ideal about commercialized society - though its better than most of the alternatives have so far demonstrated to be. Let&#039;s not get into that too much, but the reality is you&#039;re right - you&#039;ve no idea if what your buying is going to give you cancer in 5 years, or if you&#039;ll end up with cholera in the morning because a farmer didn&#039;t notice his septic system had leaked into the soil under his cabbage. It&#039;s a very, very, shitty thing. <br /><br />Even if drugs are put on a pharmacy shelf, you&#039;ll never avoid these concepts, because someone else will always think they know what is good and what is bad for you, what is acceptable and what is inacceptable, what is necessary and what is unnecessary. Look at doctors. I don&#039;t trust them anymore, because they are more focused on DEA regulations and covering their own ass instead of actually caring for people. I&#039;ve had a friend suffer dramatically from this very concept, as he very nearly experienced fatal liver issues thanks to the tylenol in vicodin - and no, thats not due to alcohol, that is due to a condition that also prevents him from using alcohol too. His doctor, who should have paid attention to that, and did not - so rather than a prescription for something without apap, he gave him the default with &quot;harm reduction&quot; and sent him on his way.<br /><br />We are unfortunately left to rely on these systems, as we are unable to otherwise provide for ourselves. It is what it is. I could say SR is full of likeminded people who want to enjoy themselves just as much as we do, and therefor won&#039;t cause me harm - but we all know that to be untrue. It may be from vendor to vendor, a true statement.. and frequently it is, they are there to enjoy it with us. That does not make it any more or less worth considering, because just as easily the person they got it from could be out to cause harm, something the vendor may not have immediate control or knowledge of. It&#039;s a risk. It&#039;s identical to the risk of buying peanut butter... they don&#039;t want to give us salmonella, but sometimes it does happen. I&#039;m not going to avoid eating it because of that.<br /><br />I am still inclined to at the very least lean towards a general appreciation for this community. We are, still and always, here because of our like minds... and because of that we generally will agree. We ARE a community, and entrance into that takes at least a modicum of consistent positive contribution (though there are those who are the exact opposite of course). There was a kid in the newbie discussion forum, around when I was first actively posting after a while in the shadows just reading. She was claiming to be 15 or something, her and her friend were wanting to do meth. The thing that struck me as indicative of at least the core culture here, was that every post in that thread was to tell them not to do it. We didn&#039;t say how slippery of a slope it was, we told them exactly what was going to happen. There was some hinting towards the eventual meth-head image that we&#039;ve all come to remember from HBO stories... but overall, we took to educating them that it wasn&#039;t going to be as good and fun as they believed.<br /><br />Misinformation is going to happen - the problem also being that some of the people spreading that misinformation are spreading it because they believe it is the correct information... while being fed the misinformation by malicious puppet masters. That... is unavoidable. In our world though, evolution has changed... we no longer develop defenses or engineer new methods of hunting to survive - we are now a culture that evolves through the tests of society. Whether we like it or not, there will never be the ability to avoid misinformation... but just as any other right of passage, it is learning to cope and work through it - to read the bullshit, call it out, and get the truth - that allows us to navigate the world of bad. That stands true of any situation, drugs or otherwise. This doesn&#039;t speak highly of those who do fall for it, but unfortunately that simply explains the opposite. Silly enough, its a concept I learned from comic books. Any time you add a super hero, you get a super villain. As we get smarter and defeat it, they get smarter and come back. This is creating a gap, one that is not being filled by the present educational standards... and that, scares me most of all.<br /><br />Trust is a funny thing. Some believe in others so much that trusting happens too easily... others have such a cynical outlook that everyone is untrustworthy. Many on this community are just as happy to claim that reviews are worthless padded crap... and in some cases I am inclined to agree. I prefer to not trust, but ultimately I have to give the benefit of the doubt when purchasing something. If I go based upon all of the factors that I see, I would have never bought. Typically speaking though, I take a more novel approach to the process than the amazon way - I tend to find most of the order reviews to be largely useless. MDMA for example, 90% of the time I see reviews where someone says &quot;Just came in, looks good, will update when I try it.&quot; That update, never comes - and yet, it comes with a 5/5. What the hell is that? So, I chose instead to take a somewhat riskier balance of chance and research. For many of the things that I do, there is a wealth of information from people here, that I&#039;ve come to trust. That trust was refined through trial and error. I&#039;d buy something that looked good from reviews here on the forums, and compare my experience - and I&#039;d use that to judge the character of the reviews made by the reviewers.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t turned that around yet, to post my own reviews... mostly because I haven&#039;t felt I have enough experience to do so yet. I have though come to determine that we have a lot of smart people here, good - and bad - through those experiences... and because of that, I lean towards a distrust. That is just how I analyze things. It&#039;s that analytical skill though, that I hope to eventually pass on to my children.

Who is going to pose these interviews? Surely you can&#039;t expect it to be a multiple choice question test - this is the internet. Not to mention there are plenty of adults here who would be out-smarted by kids too. They may not necessarily be on the forums (though some are), but they&#039;re present everywhere.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a problem that can be solved. There are too many variables. The beauty of SR is in its ambiguity. Hell, the entire purpose of it is pretty well described in the forbes interview. It&#039;s here not because DPR thinks drugs are great or harmless, but because he believes - like we all believe - that the right to use them in the face of those potential harms, is at the very core of being free. Introducing systems like that, only serves to limit the freedoms of people that suddenly become alienated by the &quot;higher order&quot; individuals. It becomes a class based community, whereby suddenly we decide who is and who isn&#039;t allowed in our little group.<br /><br />That sounds ... well I wouldn&#039;t want to be a part of that.

				Simple fact is; If you have such a place where anyone, of any age with the skill to access it, is able to buy whatever drug they want completely anonymously, then you have to come to expect these sort of things.<br />But honestly, what harm can come to this? The only thing I can think of is a mass of immature 14 year olds posting on these forums and spamming them (which i think we can agree, most of the people with high negative karma is usually due to the regular immature and uneducated posts, making it quite obvious).<br /><br />Just go with it, enjoy silkroad and accept this sort of stuff,<br />Locker.

				Most references to SR which I&#039;ve seen on Tumblr are surprisingly sensible, often answering questions about SR with posts such as, &quot;I don&#039;t want to talk about it&quot; or, &quot;No, I am not going to tell you how to buy drugs on Silk Road&quot;. The way Tumblr works, those who are most respected are asked the most questions. Generally the posts about drugs by teens on Tumblr are far more knowledgeable than those made by their parents and grandparents on Facebook, and often more creative and less likely to offend than those made here.<br /><br />Perhaps it depends on the area of Tumblr one inhabits?

Legislation does not always reflect &#039;normalised&#039; behaviour, especially in countries with non-elected rulers. Where I live, the more that LSD and ecstacy were openly promoted, the greater was the reaction from the authorities. Before they were openly promoted, neither were illegal to possess. As their use increased and more people started promoting them, the penalties for possessing them became more severe, and today they are both legally classified as &quot;Class A&quot; drugs (the most dangerous category).<br />&nbsp;<br />One of the criticisms of Timothy Leary by Aldous Huxley and others was that Leary&#039;s open promotion of LSD in the USA, and his encouragement of others to do similarly, led directly to the authorities bringing in legislation to control it.

				Maybe DPR should add some sort of IQ test that requires you to pass before you can make an account. Idk if publicity is good or bad for the road, but if LE know that kids are able to get drugs through the internet, they will more likely try even harder to bust everyone on the Road and just bust the whole thing in general. <br /><br />But honestly, who gives a shit about those kids? If they get caught, GOOD FOR THEM. They shouldn&#039;t even be on here if they don&#039;t have the common sense to keep their dumbass mouth&#039;s shut. <br /><br />BTW, is there an age requirement or anything to be here?

				Being apart of the younger group I see no hope for my peers, at least the ones in my area.<br />Maintaining a security culture to some extent is key when using SR and in general, they can&#039;t<br />keep their mouthes shut about anything. If one of my peers found out about SR they wouldn&#039;t<br />be able to shut up about it. I could easily see the one that found out about it telling all of his/her friends and getting them <br />all to put money towards making a big purchase, misusing the product, and making phone calls to <br />excitedly tell their friends, how f****d up they are all while posting incriminating pictures/videos on their <br />favorite social networks. I brought up Edward Snowden to an acquaintance today, it was the first he heard about him,<br />after he made a quick google search he exclaimed in a very surprised voice, &quot;The NSA is spying on us?!&quot;<br />Their interest in things are based off of others feedback.

There is one user with that name on the main site so that part is true, but the original article didn&#039;t say that. So are you just messing with that particular user or did you find out for sure with your own digging? I&#039;m contemplating sending him a message and asking him to take down that blog post, show him the article and politely explain why it&#039;s necessary.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second off, unto to the subject matter of the article itself. There are some extremely valid issues raised by the posters in this thread about what having a bunch of &quot;teens bragging on Tumblr&quot; is NOT a good thing for this website and why the community should rally against this behavior and try to curb it.&nbsp; There is the obvious security risks for not only those posters but for their vendors and the site in general. Some of the tumblr posters were posting some of the stealth packaging and talking about it. That puts a great risk on the vendor. What if that got intercepted by their parents and their parents inform the post office and the post office informs the DEA? Vendors are already taking on this risk obliviously, but the bragging kids increases that Beta of risk to new deviations. Knowing that, why would those vendors continue to sell? This could lead to less quality vendors while good risk-savvy vendors back out. <br /><br />While we are talking about the vendor side of the equation here, not only do current vendors have a greater risk of getting caught because of these kids recklessness -- it opens the doors for less reputable vendors to fuck over people. This increases the publicity of the site on the worst venues (tumblr) and opens the possibility for more scammers both customers and vendors.&nbsp; Like I said before if the if smart vendors leave because they&#039;re getting compromised then the dumber vendors have room to increase, someone who could fuck up your order, straight up scam you out of BTC, get caught by LE because they didn&#039;t use the proper security measures and practice good stealth techniques. If someone posts about their use of the shit on tumblr with a selfie do you want to trust them with any kind of sensitive information about you whether you&#039;re buying or selling from the person? <br /><br />tl:dr : kids posting about SR scares off venders; creates more scammers and stupid vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen similar things happen to similar online communities for years. Even a clearnet forum for selling drugs before SR was invented, the place got shut down a couple months after people were talking about in on Facebook and what do you know, LE found them out. I know the Road is different, but I&#039;m cautious. <br /><br />As far as what we can do about it? A couple people have already suggested making some kind of quiz which is what I was thinking at first. There would a general guideline with certain rules and then a quiz on those rules before allowing someone to register. I don&#039;t know if the technology is there to do that.&nbsp; Either that or a landing page you have to read before you can register. Something that goes into detail about not talking about Silk Road on social media for your own safety and those of the other people on the site. At least make sure that thought is put into peoples heads to get them to think twice. At least that? Even just having a &quot;Fight Club Rules&quot; general guideline. As far as the question of age verification goes, alcohol, tobacco and porn are all sold on the Road. You have to show ID to buy those in real life. So it would make sense to have some kind of &quot;You need to be 21 or over to use this site&quot; message even though that sound as redundant as pissing in the wind when you&#039;re talking about a site that also sells crack and heroin.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about starting an age verification service where people send a timestamped photo with their username and part of a license with their birthdate clear and their initials but everything else can be blocked out to ensure anonymity. Then make a list of those who sent me proof they are over 21 and have that list available for vendors. Or maybe someone else can do this? I don&#039;t know. It would be totally voluntary and a vendor can say &quot;I&#039;m doing business with you unless you&#039;ve verified your age&quot; or something. That might curb the influx at least.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />No one here wants to see this balloon out of control and watch silk road be brought down to a flaming ruin by reckless and retarded sixteen year olds.&nbsp;

				You know what?

I just think of these sorts of people who are openly bragging about what they are doing, and that is where LE will be focusing their efforts because it&#039;s much easier and we all know how lazy LE really is.<br /><br />And this doesn&#039;t just go towards the guys on tumblr but also facebook and twitter. what are they thinking? are they just asking for trouble.<br /><br />get on the road, do you research on the forums, contribute where you feel like, don&#039;t give away any personal details, get your drugs and that&#039;s it. don&#039;t link any of your other internet activity to the SR. and keep your bragging about it IRL to a minimum. Yes it&#039;s impossible to keep it to nothing (unless your super disciplined, and I&#039;ll admit I am not) because when you&#039;re in a club and you&#039;re off your face, I know all too well the temptation is to tell people that your off your head on drugs YOU BOUGHT ON THE INTERNET (!!!), but keep it to a VERY minimum.<br /><br />It all comes down to one thing - be FUCKING smart about it.

I am referring to the experiences in which it would be more secure to keep to themselves, or spread to as few people as possible. Some of my peers love bragging to their parents about how drunk/high they get believe it or not. I can think of a few off the top of my head that would. Maybe this isn&#039;t that bad to some of you. However, I think that in society, especially today, it&#039;s important to know when some things just are meant to be kept to oneself or a few select people.

So it&#039;s good when a young person can see that what they are doing is stupid cause so many are just clueless.<br /><br />Re: Social media and television: All young people have ridiculous amounts of peer pressure placed on them. Moreso than over, and far more than I faced when I was in High School....But the fact that you can see it and you can see the bullshit that social media and television represent, means that one day you will push through to the other side.

I have seen over 250,000 posts either on my dash or in people&#039;s archives, and not one of them was from someone boasting about buying drugs on SR. Neither have I come across any screenshots of SR (although I&#039;m sure a search would turn up the usual images, including copies of the one used by Wikipedia). I have seen 4 or maybe 5 posts which mentioned SR, all replying to anonymous questions along the lines of &quot;Have you ever used Silk Road?&quot;. (There is a tradition on Tumblr of active bloggers being prepared to answer any question, no matter how intimate.) The responses (as best I can remember) were: &quot;I&#039;ve used Silk Road, but I don&#039;t want to talk about it&quot;; &quot;No, I am not going to tell you how to use Silk Road&quot;; &quot;I used it once, but I won&#039;t be using it again&quot;; and &quot;Yes. Why do you want to know?&quot;<br /><br />YMMV, but that is my experience.<br /><br />If I came across a Tumblr blog where someone openly boasted about taking drugs on Silk Road, I would almost certainly &quot;Ignore&quot; them, not least because of the possibilities that they were LE or setting bait for a phishing site.<br /><br />However, Facebook may well be different. I wouldn&#039;t know. And as for Reddit...

				Damnit fuck!!!&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry for the profanity, but this is what ruins it for everyone else!&nbsp; Anyone remember when Salvia Divinorum was legal?&nbsp; The drug itself isn&#039;t such a big deal-- it&#039;s very intense but harmless.&nbsp; Yet nobody really paid attention to it until teenagers started posting videos to youtube and shit, and getting in trouble with&nbsp; their parents and LE.&nbsp; Once this started happening, it was decided that &quot;This drug is a problem and must be taken care of.&quot;&nbsp; which means, essentially, that someone is running for office and can use it as an issue for their campaign agenda.&nbsp; Now, at least in my state, it&#039;s a federal offense to posess.&nbsp; Minimum of five years.&nbsp; for fucking SALVIA.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been expecting SR to fall down because of this kind of thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s almost always the youngsters that ruin it for everyone else.&nbsp; We shouldn&#039;t have to deal with this shit!&nbsp; There are many, many of us who are discreet and careful about our purchases, behavior, and use of the products we receive.&nbsp; Very many of us, like myself, do it privately and don&#039;t involve anyone else.&nbsp; We&#039;re as responsible as possible and only want to preserve the personal freedom we have enjoyed so far.... and yet we&#039;re going to have to suffer for the stupid, arrogant kids who haven&#039;t learned to comport themselves.&nbsp; <br /><br />The media, particularly advertising,&nbsp; focuses on teens, essentially projects the image that they&#039;re the center of the universe, and so of course they believe it!&nbsp; I doubt that&#039;s going to change in the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Yet it&#039;s bullshit, it&#039;s the illusion of modern commercialization-- and WE have to suffer for their indiscretion!&nbsp; <br /><br />Ok... rant finished.&nbsp; Sorry, it&#039;s just... frustrating.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s never going to happen, but, I wish people would just SHUT UP about SR.&nbsp; Boasting about it doesn&#039;t get anybody laid.&nbsp;

It puts everyone in the position to be seen at all times and quantifies popularity with things like permanent comments and &quot;likes&quot; shares etc. Young people are already seeking attention in the first place and do dumb things to get it -- that&#039;s a given. But with the internet they can be seen and validated by way more people, giving them the illusion that they&#039;re stupidity isn&#039;t stupid because they are tons of other people doing the same stupid thing.&nbsp; I hate generalizing people because I don&#039;t know them and can&#039;t read their minds but judging from what these was posted in these examples in the article it definitely rings of a case of validation/attention seeking. People love exclusivity. It&#039;s like they are trying to say &quot;Hey look at ME, I know about a cool new thing that YOU don&#039;t know about. That&#039;s right IIIIIII know about this thing. I&#039;m part of the super secret special club but because I&#039;m so cool I&#039;ll help you get in on it!&quot; -- That&#039;s what I&#039;m reading&nbsp; into this. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just over analyzing though. It takes a certain level of mature to move your locus of control from an outer position,&nbsp; where other peoples opinions of you are what&#039;s important, to an inner position, when you&#039;re opinion of you is what&#039;s important.

Therefore unless the quality of their judgement is constant, most people will have impaired judgement regardless of the status of their brain growth.<br /><br />I would go further, and suggest that should one finish &quot;growing a brain&quot; then neurologically this would be equivalent to brain death. Biologically the brain does not &quot;grow&quot;, in fact the reverse. The number of brain cells one is born with slowly decreases. Brain cells that die are not replaced. [*] However throughout a person&#039;s life the brain is able to &quot;grow&quot; in the sense of being able to reorganise its neural pathways and patterns in response to internal and external stimuli, although this ability tends to decrease with age.<br /><br />People become mature as they grow older, but this mainly entails taking on rigid roles within the society and learning better defences against threats to their ego. In any selected age group I would expect the proportion of people with impaired judgement to be similar. In WWI millions of young people (many of them under 18) were needlessly slaughtered because of the impaired judgement of their elders. <br /><br />Were tests to be devised for measuring people&#039;s judgement, I suspect the results would correlate better with the age of those designing them than with the age of those taking them.<br /><br />Sterotyping age ranges and generations is divisive. Generalisations need to be used with care when the differences within any one group may be greater than the average differences between the members of the set of groups it belongs to.<br /><br />Returning to the OP, Tumblr has 100 million blogs, with 75 million new posts being added daily. IMO one unverified example, taken from an online scandal rag, out of a total of 50 billion posts does not justify the title of this topic.<br /><br />[*] It is thought that while glial cells regenerate, the production of new neurones in humans ceases by the age of four. However in 1999 two neuroscientists claimed that there were indications of neurone renewal in the brain of an adult macaque monkey. If true, then such growth would be an important brain function, the loss of which would likely be detrimental to judgement rather than enhancing it.

Plus people who make unofficial Facebook pages not affiliated with the thing they are posting about creating such a cancer for everyone else.

				There are 12 year olds programming semi-complex programs in arcane languages--PGP will not be a deterrence at all. At 12, I knew what not to brag about. <br /><br />I really see no issue with &quot;kids&quot; being here. A 17 year old doesn&#039;t really change that much in one year. I also much rather them get drugs that are higher in quality and less risky than what they get on the streets. <br /><br />I&#039;m rather sure about 10% of customers here are probably below 18.

				&nbsp; Fuck Tumblr, that shit is for bitches and snitches, I couldn&#039;t even log in through TOR.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I agree with everyone who said there&#039;s no real way to keep kids off of the site.&nbsp; I fear if we had a quiz or something, that people would just look up the answers.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I was a young&#039;un, just a little fella, we would break into the university computers, hack computers all over the world, etc. all remotely with our little 2400bps modems.&nbsp; I almost bought some MDE from canada, it wasn&#039;t scheduled there yet, so you&#039;d send some cash in an envelope to some sketchy address in toronto, boom!&nbsp; there were many such offers.&nbsp; This one guy from the chemistry dept. wanted to help me set up a meth lab, I think he was full of shit(or a cop) so that ended pretty quickly.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was a very curious youth, although I have to say that I never talked about drugs online, that was always a big line, the kids these days need to know that we will ALL be fucked out of existence if children become at risk because of this.&nbsp; &nbsp;From what I hear, though, professionals in the substance abuse field are almost completely unaware of SR and drugs-by-mail in general, so I don&#039;t think it has really sunk into the collective consciousness yet, everyone knows about it, but I think because of the barriers of entry, having bitcoins, a secure address, etc.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone really cares.&nbsp; &nbsp;We should start a social media campaign about talking about drugs, it should be a universal ban on &quot;sourcing&quot; info, like on the Reddit drug forums, there&#039;s no sourcing on there, so if you got it on SR, well thats on you, don&#039;t tell everyone where you got it.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was a prime rule with the drug scene on the streets when I started getting into that in my late teens, you never reveal your source, kids need to smarten the fuck up, because doing drugs isn&#039;t cool.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doing drugs and silently getting away with it, is cool =)&nbsp; Tell them they&#039;ll get more sex if they keep quiet about the drugs, that will help, well I won&#039;t be saying that to kids, but someone else can.&nbsp; Everybody needs to be like Fonzie.&nbsp; WHAT IS FONZIE LIKE? He&#039;s COOL, baby, and if you stay cool like fonzie, ringo here isn&#039;t going to get hurt, and you&#039;ll both leave here with what you want.&nbsp; Now get my wallet out of the bag, its the one that says &quot;BAD MOTHERFUCKER&quot; on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You silly Rabbit!

				IMHO I think perhaps exterminating these kids may be a bit harsh.&nbsp; I am wondering where they&#039;re parents are?&nbsp; &nbsp;Teenagers still need lots of &quot;guidance&quot;, and I think parents should be looking at their Facebook pages.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know most kids are happy to have a parent who actually cares about what they&#039;re doing.&nbsp; It could be a very harsh lesson and experience for a kid to buy a bunch of H, sell it, and then do hard time for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some may argue that it may set them up to fail the rest of their life.&nbsp; I think parents should be much more involved in their kids lives.

				If kids actually knew what drugs did to them when they&#039;re young, they wouldn&#039;t do them. Your brain is still developing and the chemicals fuck with it and re-arrange your brain chemistry. When you&#039;re using them you don&#039;t realize it or think it will happen to you, and most people probably don&#039;t even realize it when they grow up. I smoked almost everyday, with a couple month breaks in between,for almost 3 years straight when I was 13-16 and now I&#039;ve been fucked ever since I was about 15 1/2. If you&#039;re pre-disposed to mental illness and you do drugs growing up, you&#039;re going to have a higher chance of getting it, and are most likely going to be fucked for a long time if you start having an episode. It&#039;s been a few years now and I&#039;ve had the same thoughts stuck in my head and can&#039;t focus on anything, and can&#039;t get them out of my head, and it distracts me and I literally won&#039;t be able to do anything to my full skill level, if even close. The only thing that partially helps now is Benzo&#039;s, and my doctor and therapist won&#039;t fucking give me any more than 10 lorazapam per month. That&#039;s pretty much why I&#039;m here. Guess the moral of my story is if you start doing drugs young you&#039;re future can potentially be a complete 180 of where you want to go.

Seeing what a pattern of future use would do is not likely to affect many kids short term choices. That&#039;s why I agree most kids need an adult to help them choose a less harmful path than they would choose on their own. The drug war, however, keeps drug education from being honest and allowing adults to effectively protect young people from a lot of harm. <br />Just like many died from bad booze during prohibition, these are dangerous times we live in. Thank goodness for SR&#039;s efforts at restoring freedom to consume and to educate. How to buy here is news that spreads like wildfire. The educational info spreads less rapidly, but, most of these kids are not so stupid they don&#039;t care about safety when not in the moment. It would be good to make safe use and age specific safety info more easily accessible, but, a lot of it can be found here and I am sure many are searching for it.

In my eyes your welcome to come back whenever you get your mind right and become a more productive person instead of self destructive.<br /><br />On another now i personally know people who started using SR at age 15 and 16. Although i don&#039;t agree with it, they are surprisingly very mature considering the subject. They know that if they are ever caught it wont help rolling on SR and they use their orders responsibly. Most kids at that age i believe would just order one drug after another out of shear irresponsible curiosity

But there is not any such thing as &quot;drugs&quot; (they are all different) and they affect every individual differently depending on what they get interested in, or what they require for health.<br /><br />For instance, very few people ever feel like their experiments with nootropics (like piracetam, aniracetam, oxiracetam) ruined their life. It depends entirely on your intentions and self-consciousness with regards to personal health as you go into it... and that is something true about all behaviors, not just drugs.

I have seen similar statements before in anti-drug propaganda, but it is difficult to track down creditable sources for them. The usual explanations given are along the lines of, &quot;It&#039;s obvious&quot;, or &quot;Everyone knows this is true&quot;, or &quot;If you don&#039;t believe this you are stupid&quot;, which of course are all acceptable arguments on internet forums, although usually seen as hallmarks of lazy thinking or gullibility in formal debate.<br /><br />Anyway, I am interested in learning more about permanent physiological changes to the brain caused by recreational drugs. Much research has been done looking into possible detrimental long term effects of banned substances in order to justify the legislation prohibiting them, but older studies claiming to have found evidence for this have since been discredited in at least some cases. Therefore references to any recently published peer-reviewed journal articles detailing the biochemical mechanisms and pathways which are &quot;re-arranged&quot; would be most welcome.<br /><br />

I hope someone does post those. I am certain some drugs do &#039;permanent[ly] effect the brains chemistry&#039; (for as long as the person lives). It is obvious :-). <br />Maybe it is what was used to &quot;cut&quot;, remove pests or improve absorption rather than the drug, but I do think some people have gotten their brains slightly or full-on messed up by some drugs.&nbsp; If you can mess someone&#039;s brain up without changing the chemistry of that brain, well maybe I&#039;m mistaken. I think some of the changes drugs cause are benificial. People are certainly changed by some patterns of drug use.&nbsp; It can be hard to be certain about some drugs, though, when the drug use never really stops :-)

				I read methamphetamine permanently effects the reward system leaving people party depressed for the rest of their lives but this does sound like it could easily be propaganda and I never read into it fully, also I believe certain ssri&#039;s change the chemistry of your brain but I think after a few months it reverts back to normal not sure how permanent it is, again I haven&#039;t read into it fully.

Nearly all of these posts refer to travel and trade on the traditional Silk Route which runs through Asia. The few that don&#039;t are mostly quoting the Wikipedia article on SR, interviews given by DPR, or similar.<br /><br />However a general web search finds 1700+ references to &quot;Teens on Tumblr can&#039;t stop bragging about Silk Road drug deals&quot;. The original article appears to attack both Tumblr and Silk Road, but it is clearly propaganda aimed mainly at Tumblr, which has been coming under increasing pressure from those wanting to see it censored or closed down. As an attempt to manipulate public opinion by applying misinformation, the original article has been remarkably successful.<br />
