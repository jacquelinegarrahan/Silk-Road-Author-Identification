				I just had an unexplained order cancellation from a vendor that marked status shipped, The money was put back into my account. I just happened to look at my transaction history, and see of course that due to the crash, my long order history is now three orders, and my refund rate is now 30%....obviously wrong in light of months of orders that are now gone from my history, but correct if looked at against the three orders that are in there after the crash, I dont want vendors to think I have a 30%&nbsp; refund rate, especially as this refund was not the result of me canceling or going through resolution. <br /><br />So folks, I will cross post in tech support. Just all you vendors, when viewing buyer stats, take note that the recent crash affected the account history and refund rates.

The transaction history was truncated before the crash though, so that might or might not be the problem. I didn&#039;t specifically look at my buyer stats in quite a while.<br /><br />More important to me is that when a vendor cancels an order but no money or product has changed hands then that shouldn&#039;t count as a &quot;refund&quot;. Many vendors mark products as shipped when they were not shipped, especially international vendors. They do this so the transaction can be finalized early. I recently asked the vendor to cancel a transaction like this because he requested my address again but didn&#039;t have PGP set up for sending it. Now that shows up as a &quot;refund&quot; when it was really a canceled transaction. I didn&#039;t ask the vendor to mark it shipped then to cancel.<br />

				Wow, thats kinda bad... hope SR gets to the bottom of this one...&nbsp; the cancelled order thing should defiantly be fixed, i just cancelled one order because a guy had to go on vacation for 2 weeks and I didnt get his stuff out in time for him to get it before he left because of the outage and now it sounds like that may have negatively affected his buyer stats.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t either of our faults, just circumstances... no fault situations should not affect buyers stats.<br /><br />Paperchasing
