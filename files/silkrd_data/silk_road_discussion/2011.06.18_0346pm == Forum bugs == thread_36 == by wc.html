				- I tried signing up as &quot;William Clark.&quot; Got an error. I can log in as William Clark, but can&#039;t post. Creating this account (wc). It seems to have worked.<br />- I can&#039;t log out. In fact, deleting cookies doesn&#039;t even log me out. The only way that&#039;s been successful is to close and restart my tor browser. When I click log out, it shows me as logged out or gives me an invalid session id, but as soon as I click into the forums (i.e. click on Silk Road discussion), it recognizes me.<br />- I can&#039;t view my posts when I make them.

				I had that problem yesterday, and finally just tried to sign up with a totally new username, and the site froze, and then when I tried to sign up under my original name again, &#039;phubaiblues&#039; it said someone else was using that, which worried me, but it seems I&#039;d actually signed up somehow...but anyway, today it seems to be working much better!

				it&#039;s definitely a little screwy.&nbsp; We think it has something to do with the fact that everyone&#039;s ip address appears to be the local machine because of tor.&nbsp; forum software tries to control things via ip address tracking, which is obviously impossible.&nbsp; If it&#039;s acting buggy, try restarting tor or changing your identity.&nbsp; that seems to help.

				If you can login but not post, try going to your profile page and deleting the account.&nbsp; You should then be able to register the account again.

				I&#039;m getting something like this too... I think it&#039;s a caching problem. Don&#039;t know if it&#039;s caused by something on the forum server or the Tor proxies.<br /><br />Keep an eye on the time displayed at the top of the page. If it doesn&#039;t change when you reload the page, you&#039;re seeing an old version. Try Ctrl+F5 to bypass the cache.
