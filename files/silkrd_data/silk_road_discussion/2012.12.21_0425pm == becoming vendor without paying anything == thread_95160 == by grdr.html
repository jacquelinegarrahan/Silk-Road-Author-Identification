				I think there should be a section where people could sell what they have and want to sell but they would be marked somehow and not in the group of vendors who paid 500 dollars to become one. For example someone gets secobarbital in south africa and wants to make some money so 500$ there is a a lot money I presume and is just not worth it to pay for that because you will lose out. Sure there couldn&#039;t be any FE full escrow is a must and tracking would be nice ( tracking if buyer requests would be a must). these vendors should still pay silkroad fee&#039;s maybe a little higher than &quot;full vendors&quot;. Another example I have rare stimulant benzo tofisopam , its great for anxiety, and is not addictive but I don&#039;t have 500dll (live in 3rd world country obviously) to get vendor acc and i wouldn&#039;t make profit if I paid 500 bucks.

				if you can&#039;t come up with 500 bucks too bad imo.<br /><br />If you have a valuable idea that&#039;s going to turn profit you can attract capital.<br /><br />

				The OP has a somewhat valid point, in a third world country some of the average incomes can be as little as 50-200 a month, and that&#039;s for a whole family. I understand how someone in a third world country could have a product to sell but not the 500 to start. There should be some sort of sliding scale, Obviously the packages would need to be sent from that region first to prove that they are in a poor third world country, but its totally workable, and in a market like Silk Road everyone should have the same chance to become a vendor. At 150$ for a third world country vendor, I can imaging its still expensive, but at 500 USD its next to impossible. Even street drug dealers in Columbia make on average 25-35 USD a day, and most of these drug dealers have a family to support with their earnings.<br /><br />Magic<br />

				WTF 500usd&nbsp; to start a vendors account? Holy shit! When I first joined SR about 9 months ago, they were only about $120...maybe that was due to the fact that 1 BTC was worth about $4.50!!

				It had nothing to do with the btc price. it was a flat fee because the btc value is variable and not backed except by demand.&nbsp; When the road started the vendor accounts were free.&nbsp; There was a huge influx of scammers and they subsequently instated the vendor fee.&nbsp; I was in favor of this. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what i think about the $350 increase, but it doesn&#039;t affect me and honestly, my opinion doesn&#039;t matter to DPR. He&#039;s going to do things as he sees fit and that&#039;s fine by me. He&#039;s done a great job so far in my book, and if you&#039;ve got a serious problem with him, there&#039;s a simply solution: Don&#039;t participate in HIS marketplace.<br /><br />I can definitely understand how frustrating it must be to wear your shoes.&nbsp; You just found this awesome place were you can get paid to send drugs all over the world and now you find out that it&#039;s outside your reach.&nbsp; I&#039;m truly sorry, but dozens of these threads complaining about it isn&#039;t going to fix the problem. At the end of the day DPR *MAY* read these and take them into consideration but it&#039;s his decision.

				Honestly, I think the new price is totally fair. I know I only paid $150 for mine but I would have paid the $500 without hesitation because I knew my business would be good and I would easily make the money back.<br /><br />There should be absolutely no complaining about the price raise. If you cant afford the $500 fee, how are you gonna afford anything else?<br /><br />The vaccum sealer, stamps, sealer bags. Those bags aint cheap! If you cant afford the $500 fee, honestly you shouldnt be vending on here. You would be a risk to everyone&#039;s safety here on SR which is pretty much priority #1 on here. As it should be.

				You want a free ride? and not have to pay a vendor fee? Real simple sling your shit in person or travel on over to&nbsp; BMR or another onion site. <br /><br />The fuck are people thinking?&nbsp; let&#039;s not charge a fee that way a seller has no skin in the game - let&#039;s let them list items maybe ship a bit and then&nbsp; pull some selective scams or jam newbies and make them F/E &amp; take their btcs

				i can care less i don&#039;t want to vend anything here I&#039;m just saying if someone has something rare and wants to sell it like 100 rare pills why would he pay 500 dollars ? i have money if i had ENOUGH product i could come up with 500 dollars . But some drugs are hard to get and hard to have constant supply. I always tought about silkroad as a place where you would come and there would be vendors from all over the world and you could get every drug imaginable. I mean who could get here amobarbital or secobarbital? No one. And if someone in south africa got a script he wouldn&#039;t pay 500 dollars to sell 100 pills lol. has anyone read post or just title ? there could be some different section for non-vendors who wants to sell something, warning about higher risk of scamming, and they still should pay fees for products sold. Also they should use full escrow.

				If you have &quot;rare&quot; product, the $500 would be pennies in the pot next to future revenues.. so.. moot point.<br /><br />Go to BMR, sell $500 worth of goods and open an SR account. That&#039;s what I did.

Scammers will always scam and scam those 500 bucks back in no time. The raise makes it more difficult for people with a low/normal income to become a vendor on SR.<br />Imagine being SR. No idea how many people that consists of. But $500 per vendor, fees per order. They must be ff-in rich.

				The fact of the matter is, SR isn&#039;t for the average person. Being a vendor is not meant for the everyday individual, or the struggling family. It is meant for the drug dealer. And regardless of where you are, a drug dealer worth his salt, who has been in the game for long enough to know the ins and outs, to know the do&#039;s and don&#039;ts... for these invididuals, 500 dollars should not be a problem. 500 dollars should be a drop in the bucket. Especially when you consider that if you can&#039;t afford 500 dollars, how can you expect to afford investing so much of your time? Being a vendor is going to be a full time job and it requires an investment, a buy-in, so to speak. You must pay to become connected with a network of customers from around the world. To be involved in the most successful illicit global economy on the net. <br /><br />You don&#039;t see stock brokers going out saying I DON&#039;T KNOW WHY I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS STOCK, I KNOW IT&#039;S GOING TO MAKE ME MONEY SO WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WHEN I&#039;M JUST GOING TO CASH IT OUT LATER AND CONTINUE TO MAKE MONEY. That&#039;s not a very good example and isn&#039;t exactly analogous to this situation, but the point is, you pay for security. For the security of all the members of this system, to ensure that the system is able to continue running by allowing only the fittest, most knowledgable purveyors of illicit goods do what they do best. 500 dollars is completely necessary. I don&#039;t know if I would increase it further, but I do see it as a scam deterrent and an assurance that only those who know what they&#039;re doing are allowed to service the consumers of the Road.

With the roller-coaster that is the stock market these days, margin investing is way too risky. And, where are people getting a 10:1 margin? Even at the professional level (we&#039;re talking banks), the risk department will throw a fit at anything over 5:1 margin. AND, most &quot;investors&quot; lose their shirt because they&#039;re fucking idiots.

That is the stupidest thing I have read today. Yes, some stock brokers (investors) use margin to increase their share positions, but the same amount abhor the idea. With the roller-coaster that is the stock market these days, margin investing is way too risky. And, where are people getting a 10:1 margin? Even at the professional level (we&#039;re talking banks), the risk department will throw a fit at anything over 5:1 margin. AND, most &quot;investors&quot; lose their shirt because they&#039;re fucking idiots. Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re investing a cash $50 or a margined $100 (2:1 margin), if you make a stupid choice, you&#039;re going to lose a LOT of money really fast.<br /><br />And no, this place is not for everyone. It&#039;s for a certain group of people who value privacy, availability, and convenience. Not everyone values those things..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Who are you to say what values someone has to have to use SR? we understand it to be for everyone, no matter what beliefs you have. As for margin, We have many stock brokers friends/clients who work in some of the largest financial institutions in Canada and the states. Buying on margin is still alive and thriving, even more so with currency exchange. Yes there are opponents to trading using margin but it happens everyday for millions if not billions of dollars worth of trades, I dont know why you stopped reading after I made my comment but its safe to say you just jumped to a conclusion or something. I never said I endorse trading on margin&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I simply stated that its big business and that the comment the poster made whom I was quoting&nbsp; ,&nbsp; didn&#039;t have the slightest clue of what he was talking about when comparing buying a vendor account and becoming a vendor, and trading stocks.<br /><br />MM

				This suggestion has been made before, that there should be separate Vendor and Trusted Vendor categories, where the Trusted Vendors pay more. I think BMR does something like that. The single, fixed high fee reduces the number of scammers, and DPR has decided his strategy is to get rid of them entirely. He doesn&#039;t want an ecosystem of mixed trusted and scammer accounts.<br /><br />With a $500 fee, only people who are serious about vending for the long term are likely to sign up. This precludes honest people who might have a single windfall of items they&#039;d like to off load, but that&#039;s the trade off you make. It&#039;s an imperfect system, but right now it&#039;s vastly better than the swamp of scammers that exist on clearnet.

				Ya I totally agree SR is for everyone. But, vending on SR isnt. It literally is like running a business and a lot of people just cant keep afloat.<br /><br />Again, I think the price is totally fair. Its as simple as this. If you cant afford the fee, then how the hell are you gonna afford anything else involved. <br /><br />A person that cant afford the fee isnt gonna even think about taking the extra cautionary steps in order to keep themselves and their customers safe. <br /><br />Simple as that.<br />

Getting everything set up is going to cost far more than 500 dollars in the first place, and we don&#039;t need vendors who put everything on the line to vend on here. That just leads to problems - if 500 dollars is a hefty investment for you then you should just stick to whatever you do in your own life to make money. I deal IRL, and I would never ever consider vending on SR simply because I don&#039;t make the money to securely vend without worrying about having money to pay the rent or take care of IRL issues. You should have enough security money to do that, and if you can&#039;t afford 500 dollars then you frankly don&#039;t have enough money stashed securely to make this venture. And the fact that I don&#039;t want to vend because of security issues isn&#039;t saying that I don&#039;t make a good amount, since I make enough to get by pretty well. ( only make a few thousand dollars of profit a month when I&#039;m going full force but I really don&#039;t require any more than that so I don&#039;t actively seek to expand my business ) <br /><br />I mean, that&#039;s a sad nature of the beast, but it has to be done... the higher the buy-in is for anything, the less likely someone&#039;s going to risk it all to try and grift some money out of some poor folks who don&#039;t know any better. You&#039;ll never be able to stop people from scamming, but this is a heavy deterrent I feel. And it must be done.

				Also, if you think of it in terms of pure economics, the higher buy-in leads to a perceived better product. That&#039;s why good perfume and cologne costs so much money to buy; it&#039;s not because it costs any more to manufacture than cheap cologne, it&#039;s that the higher a price you pay for something, statistically speaking, the higher your enjoyment of the product is. You don&#039;t want to think bad about something you invested a lot of money in, so you respect it more. That&#039;s one of the first few rules of marketing; you have to match the price to speak to the demand/supply you have. And if you have a price too low, or a price too high, you wind up with a bad perceived value of the product. That&#039;s one of the reasons BMR isn&#039;t as popular as SR - I know people have their own theories about this, but really when you think about it, a major aspect of the entire matter is that because BMR is pretty much fucking free to start vending on, the perceived value of vending on BMR is wholly lower than vending on SR. Becoming a vendor on SR is an accomplishment, it MEANS something. That&#039;s what you pay for when you get a vendor account. <br /><br />I know a lot of people are saying that that goes against what SR stands for, that SR is for everybody including the little guy, and I understand your idealism in that respect. I would love for that to be the case. But that would have to assume that EVERYONE views SR as that ideal. That&#039;s not the case. As we&#039;ve seen from this thread, the opinions of SR are extremely different. I&#039;m not going to say that all of this is just some moneymaking scheme from DPR, because I truly believe that it does mean more than that. But it&#039;s a moneymaking scheme to a lot of people. And the sad thing about business is whenever you have a successful model such as this, there are going to be those who abuse it. That&#039;s a fact. And to be honest, I would much rather have several small-time vendors who don&#039;t have the 500 dollars to spend on a vendor account be left out than have the entire place flooded with people who dgaf and just want to scam money out of people. If you can&#039;t see how that would happen in today&#039;s world, then I don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong with you...

				Oh one more thing, if you cannot afford the $500 buy in, you will never be able to afford the lawyer&#039;s retainer you should always have ready. Every vendor here should have on retainer a lawyer, or have adequate funds set aside specifically for this purpose!

				I&#039;ll never understand the types that want a vendor account but cant afford the price no matter what it is, irl sales would produce the btcs for a vend account. Seems to me and i couldbe really off base here, but these types seem to be scammers thatdo multiple scam types per account.<br />1. is I dont have the amount to buy an account so they get free btcs somewhere&nbsp; sometimes.<br />2. Then have nothing much said for a few weeks and suddenly get mass FE feedbacks after 35 transactions.<br />3. Then does the big heist.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m just thinking out loud here.<br />Ignore my opinions if you think I&#039;m hypersensitive about scams.

				Things have changed. It is my understanding this applies to everyone who purchased a Vendor account since the price increase.<br /><br />From the Seller&#039;s Guide:<br />Bond<br />You are required to pay a bond when opening a seller&#039;s account that will be refunded to you after you have demonstrated that you are an asset to the Silk Road vendor community. To be eligible for a refund, you must have completed at least 30 transactions totaling $1,500 or more and have been a vendor for at least 6 weeks. To request a refund, send a message to vendor support after you have met these conditions. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee you will be granted a refund. All requests will be reviewed manually.
