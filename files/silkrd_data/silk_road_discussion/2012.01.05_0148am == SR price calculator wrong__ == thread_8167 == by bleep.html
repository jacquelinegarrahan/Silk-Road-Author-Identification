				i don&#039;t understand exactly what happened? the listing says $350, but when you put it in your cart it&#039;s asking for $392?<br /><br /><br /><br />maybe the bitcoin price on the site is slow to update and it is lower than it should be, making you need more bitcoins?<br /><br />did you add overnight shipping or anything?

				the price on the site is 350, when i go to my cart it is only displaying how many BTC i need to give ฿65.80, that is only 5.31 a coin, when MTGOX live displayed 6.<br /><br />Not very cool cause it menas i lost out on the great savings when it was at 6

				The rate is at 5.39, and if its true that it uses the rate of mtGox it would mean a 6hour delay. <br /><br />You can&#039;t do anything but wait,<br /><br />Good Luck

				Ehm...<br />I just figured that rate is the avearge of mtgox not the live and I think this rate is obtained from the last 24h of market,<br />So, if I were you I would wait about 20h for this rate to increase.<br /><br />Cheers.

				so SR has taken away the BTC - $ counter, when i work things out using MTgox live prices, they are not even right here on SR, this is no good.<br /><br />i just read in a topic the took away the BTC counter cause it was a security flaw and we could just have MTgox live open in a tab to work things out manually, but this does not work!!

				We need Silk Road to post thier current pricing of BitCoins because Silk Road values BitCoins at different prices than EVERY OTHER SITE.

				I believe SR is using the weighted daily average from MtGox, otherwise the prices move up and down too quickly.

				Silk Road has always had a delay of several hours when posting the Bitcoin value.&nbsp; This means that the &quot;1 BTC=X dollars&quot; display at the bottom of the page was at least a little too high or too low.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t matter too much if the Bitcoin value stayed pretty much the same, but lately this has been a real problem when the MtGox Bitcoin price is well over six dollars and the Bitcoin price used by SR is about a dollar less.&nbsp; <br /><br />What this means is that buyers who want to get the most bang for their Bitcoin have to wait... and wait... and wait until the SR Bitcoin value starts to catch up with the actual market value.&nbsp; This is a frustrating and time wasting process.&nbsp; When you&#039;ve just purchased Bitcoins at the market value it just doesn&#039;t make sense to use them on SR if you&#039;re not going to get the full value of your Bitcoin. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of SR using the weighted daily average from MtGox, and I hope that&#039;s not true. But I do wish SR would reinstate the &quot;1 BTC=X dollars&quot; display, and do something to keep the price up to date.
