				sorry in advance if this is a repost.&nbsp; anyone know anything more about this?<br /><br />http://www.starherald.com/news/local_news/couple-sentenced-in-lsd-mail-delivery/article_47ba1560-3457-11e2-97d9-0019bb2963f4.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A Scottsbluff man and woman accused of receiving delivery of LSD and other drugs through the U.S. Postal Service were sentenced Wednesday.<br /><br />Andrew Vanderveen, 22, and his girlfriend Sarah Trook, 20, were charged in June after authorities learned of a delivery of LSD via the U.S. Postal Service. According to an arrest affidavit, the U.S. Postal inspector and a special agent with Homeland Security investigations conducted a controlled delivery of an envelope containing a half-gram of LSD to a post office box owned by Vanderveen. WING investigators observed Vanderveen pick up the envelope, which contained 50 squares of LSD.<br /><br />After authorities arrested Vanderveen, he admitted to possessing other quantities of LSD, hashish, marijuana and mescaline and psilocybin mushrooms. Authorities attempted to locate the drugs, which Trook had allegedly recovered from the residence and attempted to hide at a friendâ€™s home.<br /><br />Police recovered three grams of marijuana, quantities of LSD, five grams of hashish and 68 grams of mushrooms.<br /><br />According to court documents, Trook pled no contest to a charge of being an accessory to attempted possession of a controlled substance, a Class IV felony. Prosecutors dismissed four charges of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver, a Class III felony, in a plea agreement.<br /><br />She received a sentence of two years probation, Scotts Bluff County Attorney Doug Warner said.<br /><br />Vanderveen also received a sentence of probation on a charge of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver, a Class IV felony. Prosecutors dismissed three other counts of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver, all Class III felonies, as part of a plea agreement.<br /><br />Vanderveen has been sentenced to serve three years probation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I would have thought the best option in something like this would be to just say nothing/deny everything don&#039;t see why he admitted to so much.

				he got a very good deal for the amount of LSD he recieved...he wouldnt have gotten such a deal if he didnt cooperate... when you get busted thats a judgment call you have to make. with controlled delivery + other evidence they surely had, him denying it would do nothing but hurt his chances of a plea bargain<br /><br />on the other hand, this article is kinda confusing. at first it says 1/2 a gram of LSD and then says 50 tabs. So im not sure how much he actually recieved

				What I wonder is how the discovery was made and if it was an SR deal (media prob would hype it unless they are investigating still). I had a buddy some years ago whose vendor snitched his custys out after he was caught. Subsequently he was watched by the FBI for a very long time. I was luckily out of state and out of contact during that time. A lot of folks had to lay really fucking low.

				I think there is always an element of risk involved in this game (whether buying or selling) and you must do everything you can to minimize that risk. You have no idea how many risks that person took for all we know they did blatant things like not using PGP for address hell maybe they even used their SR username on clearnet and had that attached to a facebook account or w/e who&#039;s to say. I think for the most part though that the element of risk here is very small as long as you observe the most basic techniques to protect your identity.<br /><br />edit: my post assumes the seller was caught on SR but I don&#039;t even think that&#039;s the case because it would have probably been mentioned in the article.

				Think that its pretty typical charge considering they probably didn&#039;t have any priors and didn&#039;t just tell LE to suck a dick <br /><br />

So, when LSD is put on blotter, suddenly the police get to include the weight of the paper itself when measuring the evidence. Half a gram of blotter paper is like the weight of a 10 strip. It counts as the same thing as half a gram of pure LSD crystal under the law though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Damn! Didn&#039;t know that. That&#039;s ridiculous! Especially when it&#039;s about LSD.

				50 sheets of acid would equate to about half a gram of crystal, someone might call a 10x10 sheet a square. ProfADaemon is probably right though, if they got caught receiving 50 sheets in the mail there is no way in hell they would have gotten off so lightly.

				Maybe the letter was sitting in a room full of smoke at the seller&#039;s house. The dog sniffed it and that&#039;s that. Still scary! Lessons to be learned.
