				Hey road readers! <br /><br />This isn&#039;t necesarily going to be a profound set of statements or anything loike that. I have just been irkin a bit lately to share&nbsp; apersonal word about integrity. When I found out about the road... when I even barely heard of it.. I was pretty excited. When I finally logged in, I was intrigued and motivated to become a presence here so I could give presents! How great is it t ohave christmas any time of the year through the simple medium of your mailbox? <br /><br />With that, I am compelled to share a simple note on integrity. What makes it what it is? I mean, how is it some simply have it? It seems the more popular this place becomes the more scammers become prevalent. And also the more upper class vendors make it Large, the easier temptation seems to beg to take the money and run. But then again sessy came back?! Who was surprised with that? I&#039;m not sure where it&#039;s been progressing but the initial attempt &quot;seems&quot; to have at least some meritt. <br /><br />I have a fantastic family... IRL. My crew and other close ones are too beyond irreplaceable. And a serious trend in business has been developing... the actual act of honesty at all costs in all endeavors. I have a few sisters that have been given extra pounds, paid too much, mad mad extra cash... I mean more than 10k at a certain time... And you know what? They gave em back! Much to the pure astonishment of the receiver. It&#039;s like a liberating fucking thing when you find yourself able to &quot;Take&quot; something of much value, with little or no perceived reprcussions... And without even thinking it over... you know you are.... fine without keeping it. You don&#039;t &quot;need&quot; anything extra. And you give it back. And it&#039;s a time to rejoice! Because it sends that repeating message, that human behavior has a source, a trend, a......................... progression. <br /><br />And it&#039;s going the way of truth. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying I&#039;ve never scammed anyone IRL. I&#039;ve never been a &quot;scammer&quot; per se... but I won&#039;t say I&#039;m a fuckin saint. I will say, it&#039;s quite easy to imagine scamming fools when they can&#039;t see you, know you, or contact you IRL. And all I can ever think is how shitty a world it must be in... to fuck fools over... Royally... and have however many people, out there, in the world, cursing your fucking shitty ass handle. Forever. That alone reminds me why I will never scam anyone. I&#039;ve had issues, crew mishaps and other mistakes with good intentions behind. But deliberately lying, screwing over, scamming.... Shit. It&#039;s a Karmic debt I&#039;d like not to have on my shoulders. Because I believe every single thing You do has an effect towards the growth of the whole. And I&#039;ve come to the realization a long time ago that I am here to serve. <br /><br />So to all those out there that see themselves as separate, are disconnected, and have to &quot;take&quot; from others out of fear of not having enough... since they believe they live in a dog eat dog world or live in fear and need to or have some other bullshit justification going on in their feeble heads (read: LE), it must suck to be you. The road is a grand place for kind commerce in a system that is still somehow supporting itself..... <br /><br />Overall it is too much fun providing drugs and love to peeps I don&#039;t know. Thanks to those who took a chance on a new vendor back when we got started. We&#039;re definitely still a small fish and probably will stay that way but we couldn&#039;t be here withou... well I guess it isn&#039;t really all about the buyers yet haha. SR is definitely a sellers market.. for now. But that don&#039;t matter. We still treat our custies with the best service and attention. We always try and make things right and have consistently gone above and beyond for many. And for any we mighta missed we&#039;ll always be glad to get things straight if given the opportunity. <br /><br />LL SR<br /><br />RB<br />
