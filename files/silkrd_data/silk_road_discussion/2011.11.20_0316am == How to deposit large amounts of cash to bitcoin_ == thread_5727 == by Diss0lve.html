				I&#039;m talking about $1000 in cash into bitcoins with the least amount of trouble and traceability.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve used get-bitcoin and have split up my deposits at different brances and such but I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s not that hard for them to catch on especially since i&#039;ve been having to make weekly deposits.&nbsp; I&#039;m hesitant of moneypak for obvious reasons.&nbsp; What&#039;re your bright ideas?

				If the money is great then using a 3rd party may be an option.

				<br />I can keep a secret and send cash w/a tracking number. Or a blank money order from Walmart, Amscot or anywhere just about. I am good at this kind of thing.

				Bitcoins should align themselves with another concept that&#039;s growing called DGC (digital gold currency). There&#039;s no Tracing on how much gold or silver you can buy. You then turn it into DGC, then BitCoins as needed. This would also lend BitCoins to much more stability. For now I agree with using various BC exchanges, use the ones where you can send Money Orders and Tumble your BC&#039;s as much as you can. Also helps to frequently change the BC address when receiving into your SR account.

				always do it in smaller amounts rather than one lump sum.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tradehill will not let you transfer large amounts (as of very recently) without sending them photo ID for AML verification. They will also not let you withdrawal over 99 bitcoins without your account being frozen and flagged for AML.... you then have to prove your identity before you can get your coins / cash unlocked.&nbsp; MtGox is the same, not sure about any other exchanges. The fucked up part is they wait until they have your money before they tell you this.&nbsp; I Do not recommend tradehill or mtgox to anyone. avoid those two like the plague. i&#039;m sure ppl here have other exchanges to add to this list.
