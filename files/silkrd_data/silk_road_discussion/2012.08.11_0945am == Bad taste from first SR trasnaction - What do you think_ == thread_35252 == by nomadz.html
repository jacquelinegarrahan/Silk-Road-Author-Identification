				I&#039;ve been waiting for over a month for my surprise to show up, while I FE&#039;d the seller&#039;s keeps changing the estimated arrival time with excuses like &quot;students are now sorting out the mail&quot;. He keeps on claiming the surprise went out on the original date he mentioned, but then again why would he keep holding me up? Will I still be able to take him to resolution if I become patient and lets say waited for a couple of months?<br />What do you guys think? That&#039;s my first SR trans to see how it works and so far it doesn&#039;t. Do all sellers change to in-transit while they actually haven&#039;t shipped?

				If your vendor is still at least communicating I&#039;d say you are probably good. Be patient. I don&#039;t think there is any resolution option is your FE.

				Next time don&#039;t finalize early for anything, for your first few orders keep them domestic and small if possible, once you figure this place out a little more and can figue out what vendors are 100% legit (use the forums) you will be fine.<br /><br />I cant stress enough on how important it is to research your vendors, also don&#039;t finalize early, then the vendors have to do there there part of the deal and actually send the goods to keep there reputation as a legitimate business.<br /><br />

				Go change your feedback.. IF you FE&#039;d you can sitll change your feedback to a 1... and leave a nasty comment.. <br /><br />Change the rating only once you receive your order.<br /><br /><br />99% of vendors ask brand new buyers to FE...... What are newbies to do?

				Thanks guys for the feedback.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame that this thing happens with a top seller, I wont mention his name yet since I&#039;d like to leave some faith on his side (but when the time is right I&#039;ll warn all of you guys).<br /><br />If this thing happens with a top seller, which has had very good feedback&#039;s (I did my research on the forums as well) and at the time of the order he was AA, How can you expect such a fault? I have to be honest and say that right now his feedback status is not as good as it was at the time of my order.<br />Is there any history of sellers becoming scammers once they hit the jackpot and become big?<br /><br />How can you be careful these days not to fall a victim of a scammer? I guess there&#039;s always the risk and theres no means of minimizing them after you&#039;ve done your careful research about the guy (people change dramatically, or they aren&#039;t what they seem at first).<br /><br />

				happens all the time buddy...<br /><br />the first big one i remember was vmm with his huge 420 scam and i think tony76 did the same thing?<br />had so much money in front of them and couldn&#039;t help themselves i guess&nbsp; ???<br />theres prolli some before that too...<br /><br />i think the biggest one lately tho is skyy: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12479.msg394172#msg394172<br />was the no 1 vendor for molly, then just turned scam all of a sudden.<br /><br />also be very careful with exchangers on SR, preferably don&#039;t use them at all (specially not that prick bitcoinsforless&nbsp; &gt;:()<br /><br />it&#039;s simple if you don&#039;t wanna get scammed then STAY IN ESCROW and NEVER EVER FE&nbsp; ;)<br />it&#039;s the only way to be completely sure, when even the best vendor can turn bad at anytime&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />

				I&#039;m guessing SR reputation is on the line if you cannot even complete a single transaction.<br />Damn you scammers!<br /><br />How will the road attract new crowd if this system isn&#039;t even functional.<br /><br />And let&#039;s say I wouldn&#039;t FE and went to resolution.

				Vendors require REAL transactions so obtaining a positive transaction status with digital goods and junk you don&#039;t need isn&#039;t really the way to go.

				i can understand the frustration of new users. i&#039;ve only been here about 3-4 months myself. without doing a single bit of research, other than reading feedback and checking out photos of stock, i made two orders. one was 1/2 oz weed from Canada that i finalised early at the vendors insistence. the other was a 1/4 from America.<br /><br />i waited nearly a month for these fuckin packages, and when neither showed up i was convinced that Silk Road was a scam.<br /><br />but - SR refunded the money for the quarter because the vendor, who had previously had good feedback, failed to fill a number of orders, making up excuses for it. and the Canadian agreed to negotiate an outcome (that was outside their set terms and conditions) whereby he reposted a 1/4 (so half of what i ordered).<br /><br />the Canadian&#039;s 1/4 showed up the second time, but the lesson was exactly what everyone here has been saying - i started to make small, domestic orders. the plan was to do this for a while, build up some confidence, and then start ordering overseas.<br /><br />but i&#039;ve now used a couple of domestic vendors whose weed is good quality, ok priced, and gets here in 3 days, and am now happy to keep using the domestic guys for larger orders. yes, it&#039;s more expensive than getting it from overseas. but Australian Customs are arseholes. i&#039;d rather pay $200 for a 1/2 oz and have it here in 2-3 days than pay 140 for a 1/2 and wait at least 2 weeks, if it gets here at all.

				if you&#039;re being asked to FE because you&#039;re new, msg those vendors and ask them to make small custom orders for you, and order these small orders from a bunch of diff vendors. before long you&#039;ll have a lot of transactions, without having risked very much.
