				I have over 12 confirmations and it was sent over 4 hours ago. What&#039;s up with the damn SR system now? This is why BTC will never be as good as it should be. People don&#039;t like to wait for their money, specially when they can look it up and see it in the chain and it doesn&#039;t show up in their account.<br /><br />

				Bitcoin and SR are two totally independent, unrelated things.&nbsp; This is not an issue with Bitcoin itself.&nbsp; This is an issue with SR properly registering Bitcoin transactions -- you&#039;ll note, however, that the Bitcoin side even in this case is flawless.&nbsp; Let&#039;s not put some blame where it isn&#039;t due.

				I have over 22 confirmations now and still nothing in my account. This will of course deter me from using SR for buying in the future. They won&#039;t care of course because they are based on volume now, but eventually if they screw enough people it will catch up to them. Having the law against them already is enough, but then have your own users with their lost money could be a lot worse.<br /><br />

As you said, the transaction is already in the block chain. If you transferred the coins to your own bitcoin-qt client, they would show up as soon as the transaction propagated across the network to it, which in my experience takes seconds. Of course, it&#039;s convention to wait until 6 confirmations before you can spend the coins.

				I&#039;m also waiting on some bitcoins that have yet to show up in my account...I&#039;ve never had this problem before, usually they&#039;re in my account on the 6th or 7th confirmation but now it&#039;s been a few hours and still nothing :(.

				Yea, looks like we are getting fucked today and our money is being held hostage by SilkRoad. That&#039;s pretty fucked up. I made arrangements and everything knowing I would have my bitcoin and now I&#039;m totally screwed here.

				Yeah I bet there&#039;s a lot of other buyers having the same problem (or will be having the same problem soon). I was really trying to get in an order today but obviously that&#039;s not going to happen....I sent a message to support so hopefully they will fix it soon.

				So are we going to start having hundreds of threads people start the whenever they have to wait more than 5 minutes for something? Jesus Christ some of you guys whine a lot! It says right on the account page that BTC transfers take up to 6 hours to be credited to your SR account (which is not the same thing as your bitcoin wallet).<br /><br />It takes a few hours because SR implements escrow by maintaining your account balance separate from the wallet address and still tumbling the coins. Hell, I had to wait 5 or 6 hours when I sent coins to the wallet address too before the balance posted to my account, but I didn&#039;t go starting threads pissing and moaning all over the forums. And now supports gonna be bogged down with all the pms of people who can&#039;t wait that long?&nbsp; What are you doing, hitting refresh over and over on blockchain.info.
