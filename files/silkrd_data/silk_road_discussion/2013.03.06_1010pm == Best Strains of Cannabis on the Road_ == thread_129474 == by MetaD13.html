				I&#039;ve been trying different strains of marijuana since joining SR and I&#039;ve wondered, what specific strains are generally regarded as the best? So for all those who have sampled the many different kinds, which would you say are the best?<br /><br />Best Indica?<br />Best Sativa?

				I guess it&#039;s a personal thing and so many qualities to judge on.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Stating that something is the best is a bold statement that needs some backing up.<br /><br />Uniwiz,&nbsp; &nbsp;Great suggestions!&nbsp; &nbsp;I really gotta try that lemon haze.&nbsp; I love a good sativa sometimes.<br /><br />I tried the Red diesel from MROuid .&nbsp; &nbsp;It was my favorite for a while.&nbsp; It was a very unique stone,&nbsp; it was like a fuzzy feeling in my forhead.&nbsp; It was sooo tasty too.&nbsp; Dried properly.<br /><br />I had some purple kush from pkhydro .&nbsp; &nbsp;It as priced right, but I noticed it gave me withdrawals or a hang over in the morning.&nbsp; Strange ,&nbsp; heavy body load .&nbsp; It seemed like it wasn&#039;t dried right. Or too quickly or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />That friggin. M39 stuff is pretty average..&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s soooo common and industrial.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t like it.&nbsp; Very hard nugs, like rocks.<br /><br /><br />So,&nbsp; there may be good weed strains out there on the road, but sometimes it&#039;s dried poorly or it&#039;s too old or has been in a freezer.&nbsp; Strain alone isn&#039;t the only thing for sure.<br /><br />I read a few posts about some vendors selling wet or damp weed.&nbsp; Some actually went moldy In Transit and smelled like amonia.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you can&#039;t tell from those pretty pictures they post up.<br />There was even a thread a while back about how to add wieght to weed and cut it.&nbsp; &nbsp;As if..<br /><br />Jeese, did you guys see that shitty brick weed being sold in Vietnam or whatever?&nbsp; Fuck I&#039;m so glad I don&#039;t have to worry about seeing that stuff around anymore.&nbsp; Back in the day, that&#039;s all you could find.&nbsp; There were no buds. Just twigs and seeds.&nbsp; So we got it pretty good these days.<br />.<br /><br />Any other strain favorites?<br />

				There have been a few that stand out in my mind, most are sativa and hybrid strains.--------- jack herer, sour diesel, vortex, blue dream, master kush, jillybean, OG kush<br /><br />Every once in a while I get a strain or batch that I consider really top notch, but it seems to happen randomly between vendors and strains.

				In my experience, NorCalHookUp&#039;s Bubba Kush was definitely top notch and in my top 20 strains. I&#039;m a little surprised though at the current lack of variety in domestic US vendors. Even 1 year ago we had many up-and-comers and some very established cannabis vendors that seem to have vanished. Nature of the business though.<br /><br />But.. come back CannaGrrl! You had such a fantastic selection of strains, best shipping methods imo, and a great personality to boot!

				The best is subjective. Asking what is the best strain of weed is like asking what is the best flavor of ice cream. As a fairly popular weed vendor on SR and someone who s whole life revolves around it I can honestly say there is not one type of weed that is clearly better than another. It is sad to see weed being so trendy these days. People don&#039;t stop and ask themselves what they believe to be the best for them, they let someone tell them what is the best. Usually this influince comes from rap songs&nbsp; and geographic prefrences. In the north east they will say the best is sour diesel. In the south they will say that it is kush. In Florida and other inner city areas they will say that it is purples. Just because a strain is high yielding and popular among growers like blue dream does not mean it is any less potent. In fact if you look at the numbers of crops grown and the quality that comes out of them, strains like Blue Dream and M39 are very rarely screwed up and ussually grown very nicely. On the other hand strains like Sour Diesel Chemdawg&nbsp; or any of the kush strains, very commonly become hermaphrididic and stressed in one way or another.&nbsp; It s sad to see people who think that&nbsp; Sour Diesel that is completely stressed and hermaphrididic is better that well finished Blue Dream because little wayne says he s smokin on sour and all of his friends tell him that Sour Diesel is the best weed. <br /><br />Think for yourself

				I like GDP (Grand Daddy Purple) Best I&#039;ve had off the road anyway. <br /><br />Bets I&#039;ve ever smoked was some OG Kush back when I was like 18 or something, sadly it&#039;s impossible to get bud that good locally anymore.

				I go by the buzz. Smell, color, and cure are subjective to whoever grows it.<br />My friend CH, says Blue Dream auto butters too much when making BHO.<br /><br />My mood changes from time to time. The best part is I can find a strain for my day.<br />Thanks everyone for the suggestions.<br />GDP sounds really good. A change from all the sativa hybrids.<br /><br />SDM, got to make it back to your store ;)
