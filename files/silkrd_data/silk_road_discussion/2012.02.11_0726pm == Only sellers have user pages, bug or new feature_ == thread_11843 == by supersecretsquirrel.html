				It seems like only sellers on Silk Road are given a user page. Is this a bug or a new feature? (e.g. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/172062 vs http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/172063)

				You are right, I can not see anything anymore on buyers&nbsp; (registration day and last activity) just get a message: &quot;this user has no user page&quot;<br />Where can we see that data now?

				User with ID 173224 (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/173224) has a profile page, but looks like a normal buyer. Must be a glitch in the matrix. Would love to see a comment from SR admins here.

				Now this is interesting; Seems like SR has reverted back to &quot;give all users profile pages&quot;, but for some reason there&#039;s no difference between a buyer and a seller.

				Yeah me and the captain had a bit of a chat about it and he removed it basically more or less for security for the paranoid due to that it says a &quot;login date&quot; but after i explain how it effects not only myself in the whole bot thing but also other vendors and such and how so he <br /><br />anyways i hope the capt doesn&#039;t mind but this is a quote from a private convo <br />he did it because <br /><br />&quot;just being able to see when they are online. more to satisfy paranoia than block a real attack. I&#039;ll open it back up.&quot;<br /><br />anyways im just glad it&#039;s back it certainly helps :)
