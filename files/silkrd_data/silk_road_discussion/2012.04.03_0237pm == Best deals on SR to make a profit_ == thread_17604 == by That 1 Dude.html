				I notice the prices are fair here, and the choices of product are GREAT. But I am looking for a few bucks in turnaround. I suspect that many vendors with low prices stay swamped with orders and probably stay in stealth mode. <br /><br />So far I think meganugs outdoor is really dank for 450 / 2 OZs, Galindoi has powdered mushrooms that can me made into chocolates for a decent markup, DudeRugs&#039; 25i is craazy cheap and he always throws in mad extra tabs. Also Im currently trying different MDMA to see which is most effecive around 100 - 120 mg, any gram will get broken down to gel tab doses.<br /><br />The only coke where I am from is 50 - 60 a gram and seems good (although I&#039;ve never had any off the brick), I will try from therealusdirect soon but that seems to be the only vendor offering &quot;street priced&quot; coke. Crystal meth is real big here but sells cent for cent (ie $25 = .25) I would have to get it cheaper than that to make a profit (that is the one substance I would probably benefit to be a vendor).<br /><br />So If anyone can hell me find good deals for re-sale I would much appreciate it!

				I have an idea on how to make 10x my money.<br /><br />But of course like anything it needs money like 5k to make it happen for required stuff.<br /><br />If you have got the money already, just look at all the different drugs what people want to buy, see how you could increase profits like buying bulk selling small, just see which drug is best for profits but has a lot of interest.<br /><br /><br />For example if I bought Djabber&#039;s commercial hash.<br /><br />I think on the street I could sell for (around 8$) a gram.<br /><br />Or on SR 8-10$ a gram.<br /><br />= 1600$ total which 630$ I think cost = 970 profit but then you gotta remove other costs etc.<br /><br />

				Depends on where you live. For instance, I could sell MDMA f2f for 150/g easily, and on SR you can find it for as cheap as 30-40/g if you buy bulk.

				@drop guy, I was looking into that commercial (sprayed) bud, but am nervous about it being heavy and not looking like a proper 8th when i sell it. I will deff check out his commercial hash prices now, thanks!<br /><br />@addy, I agree, MDMA is kind of rare for me locally (only speedy X pills) and I think SR is going to help me corner that market big time! <br /><br />Just need some good deals on stimulants like yayo and ice. Also any mexi brick weed I could get for under 200/qp.

				MDMA seems the way to go, check out Supertrips for bulk, Skyy and AAKoven have good deals as well. Mrouid&#039;s M39 indoor grown is $225 per ounce at 2+ounce quantities and meant to be good quality, especially for the price. He offers bulk also, I have an ounce of that coming so I&#039;ll give a detailed review of it once/if it arrives. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of money to be made reselling coke if you can locate high end clients that are willing to pay a premium for fishscale quality, think hedge fund managers, IBers etc. Selling 25-I blotter as an RC-acid, so long as you explain exactly what it actually is, could be very profitable. Although I think it&#039;s actually much more profitable to be laying the blotters yourself and selling bulk on SR.

				The best deals are the ultra-potent phenethylamine derived psychedelics. You can buy 1000mg of something like DOC, DOI, 2C-P, 2C-T-4, 25I-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, 25I-NBMD, and lay it on perforated blotter (do NOT sell it as LSD!) or sell pre-measured drops of liquid solution dripped into&nbsp; peoples&#039; mouths or snorted or on sugar cubes. Then you can sell individual dosage units for anywhere between $2 and $10 and the profit margin on all these chemicals from gram price to single dose is between 500% and 10000%. 25I-NBOMe is the most profitable, but it is also the most popular now and you&#039;d have the most competition.

				I have been sitting on some pre-layed 25i tabs and seeing how it goes over locally. When I explain its diff than cid but similar people seem weary, i really enjoy it.. and damn the price is very nice. I wasn&#039;t sure how difficult it is to lay the blotter but with the extra tabs included with duderugs i get about a buck a tab. Without any extra work i dont mind that for now.. if i see a local demand I will deff consider laying it myself. <br /><br />On the other hand... I am VERY excited to someday start a vendor&nbsp; account. It would be tough for me to be $150 ahead enought to buy an account, but even then I am worried about escrow as a new vendor.. I just couldn&#039;t afford to package/ship product safely as I want, and don&#039;t see it being good practice to ask for FE before I&#039;m a highly rated vendor. I wish I could pay to update my buyer acct and the good rep I have been building with that would carry over or something. When I get the vendor acct money together I will start a thread seeking guidance in my vendor adventure..<br /><br />I was just hoping a stealth vendor would pop out of blue with great wholesale deals ;) <br />Thanks tho fellas, I have got some GREAT leads, my bookmark section is lookin like Hunter S Thompson&#039;s x-mas list!

				Yeah what that guy says. I bought my account about 20 days ago, went abroad for a holiday/meet and greet and then came back. I&#039;ve been selling for 3 days and I&#039;ve already had nearly $300 worth of sales. What&#039;s there to be worried about?

				Honestly I&#039;m still learning pgp, gonna get familiar with that and encrypting photos, need to take the time to sit down and do a bit of reading, I see all the knowledge is here at my finger tips.<br /><br />Thank you much for the reassurances, I guess I was worried about an instant interest and sales. Will deff be gearing up for a grand opening in my near future!

You could very easily sell methamphetamine at $200 per gram to certain circles of people, because they have money, and hate dealing with the typical scum bag. Since 1 g of meth can last a for many days, $200 actually is a reasonable price as long as the product is good. <br /><br />So, I would focus on getting a few to several clients where the substance in question is in high demand and where they have good jobs and expendable income to spend on a consistent basis.

				I am currently invested in product. Also, I make diversion safes out of household items that are practically raid proof. I hope to double the use of these stash cans for bonus shipping method (bullet proof shipping + really cool stash can). I have a few digital programs that are not currently available on SR. If grams of specific strains are selling for anywhere around 20usd, I can offer different strain almost every week. I am currently waiting on some dutch MDMA and feel I could probably re sell for domestic only buyers. Also I have really good autoflower seeds like Mossy Purple Jem, Auto G13, and Super Auto Haze. <br /><br />I can afford the 150, but am nervous about how fast it will make that back and see profit. Also wanting to pick up a food saver and other things for shipping. Takes money to make money i guess.. <br />
