				Did you not read the site? Straight from the bottom link bar:<br /><br />become a seller: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/register_seller<br />how does it work?: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/about<br />even a freakin&#039; wiki!: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki<br /><br />You get your bitcoins, then transfer them to the address under your &quot;Account&quot; link at the top. Then you can pay to become a seller.

				If you were dealing from Topix, that doesn&#039;t say much about your character. Neither does the fact you can&#039;t read the FAQ&#039;s on a website. from this information I would not want you mailing anyone drugs.

				I am sorry, I will reread all post. I agree that topix is a bunch of scum bags thats why i am ready to get out of there. They have about 3 legit sellers and 900 scam artist. I assume this site has a way of proving yourself to be legit and i hope to prove myself to all of you. Thank you

				Yeah I took a butchers at it after I saw it get mentioned a few times and to direct, it&#039;s a den of sin lol. @ the OP you need to get your specs on kid, you are a long way from Topix. Also I am not entirely sure why you said you were on there in the first place. Normally people avoid members that say they are from there. It&#039;s sort of seen as the same as shaggin a hooker without a condom, like playing Russian Roulette with your cock&#039;s health.

				Yeah, i thought everyone knew topix was a scam. If i ever was going to sell it would be someplace like here. 150 is&nbsp; a good chunk of change to pay but you get an established site that everyone knows about with a security system in place. I would not buy anything off topix or message anyone there or admit i had offered anything there if i had which i haven&#039;t.<br /><br />But lets give the newbie a break, he may be honest and intends to prove it.

				I&#039;ve gotten a few things from a select few people on Topix. The things that I have gotten proved to be legitimate, but I must agree with everyone else here that Topix&#039;s security is like Russian roulette, similar to fucking a Vegas hooker without a condom. Scammers are abound and you must have a very high sense of street smarts and intuition to acquire what you want. Silk Road&#039;s security and anonymity are light years ahead of anything that Topix will ever hope to offer.<br /><br />With that said, if this USA Domestic guy is the real USA Domestic from Topix, he does have quite a bit to offer in the well priced benzos arena, particularly Xanax. Let him do his research and set up a seller&#039;s account. We may be pleasantly surprised with the value that he has to offer.

				Used to buy on Topix before I found this place, it&#039;s a hell hole but there were/are a few good vendors on there.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a vendor and smart you can make a bit on there as well (googleyed from here started selling their recently). Only really UK users on there which might reflect the difference in entrapment laws in the UK compared to the US. Was a bust recently which was featured on BBC Panorama... the idiot went to meet a reporter who emailed him for a face to face meeting Glasgow selling benzos, deserves everything he gets.

Most are junkies themselves, or sociopaths who like to think of themselves as Social Engineers. I doubt if there is even 2 real, legit, sellers on Topix. <br /><br />I echo the sentiments of others on this thread. I would avoid someone announcing they were from Topix in the first place. And secondly, if you need that much help on STEP FUCKIN ZERO then you&#039;re in the wrong spot bud. Im suprised you were able to figure out Torbrowser or did you have to post on Topix to get help with that as well? <br /><br />Cunty cunt cunt!!! <br /><br />

				Topix is were 10% of the deals are legit and its brimming over with scammers and psychos and of course the police.<br /><br />Actually there are dealers on facebook. Millions of people admitting to drug use.<br /><br />How long before cops do facebook searches.<br /><br />To get good coke off Topix would be a miracle!<br /><br />People even meet up. Fucks sake!
