				Probably the best trolling I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; Hundreds if not thousands of posts exist to tell iHN how stupid, racist, and out of touch he is he is.&nbsp; I doubt he&#039;s any of those, but in any case.....credit where credit is due.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />That said, I wish you&#039;d leave off, champ.&nbsp; At least calm it down some.&nbsp; Some of us are just average chumps trying to make our way in the world, and sifting through crappy posts by the people who fall for it takes time away from work and family.&nbsp;

				Back on topic... <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to make of the publicity on this place.&nbsp; When I read articles like this it feels like a bigger target is being painted on our collective backs.<br /><br />I guess the fact that we&#039;re still here is a testament to the dedication of DPR et al, as well as the resiliency of the systems in place to protect vendors and buyers alike.&nbsp; Not to mention the determination of users to find drugs and dealers to make money. :)
