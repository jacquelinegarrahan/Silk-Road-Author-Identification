				You might want to explain what you mean. There are a bunch of different possibilities in regards to what BTC addresses means, like Instawallet, Bitcoinfog, SR account wallet, Bitcoin-Qt.<br /><br />sdesu

				He is probably referring to the ability to change the address to which you receive your BTC in SR. I was wondering about that too ... my guess is for security reasons, not having all your bitcoins you may accumulate come in over the same address?!

				Thanks for the clarification, Mahalo. <br />I do not believe there is a way to change your SR BTC address. However, if you&#039;re uncomfortable having all of your BTC on your SR account, you can always keep them in an external wallet and import them into SR only when you are going to be purchasing something. <br /><br />sdesu

You can buy numerous things with Bitcoins (Not just drugs!) they are web hosting providers that accept Bitcoins and some other legit shops too. So if you trade with XYZ people the deposit addresses will never be the same, i think SR do that as a way to blend a little more in the Bitcoin economy.
