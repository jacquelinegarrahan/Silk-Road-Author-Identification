				Im new here, I tried to read as much as I could and learn as much as I could - I spent a good 5 days reading these forums and others online before making an account and sorting out my first purchase...<br />but<br /><br />I didn&#039;t realise that I should of been ordering off a vendor who requires FE as a new user.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m worried that the vendor I ordered off is going to cancel my order and I will lose my money or something&nbsp; :(&nbsp; It was hedged so I spose I will only lose some of the money if they cancel?<br /><br />Hopefully they will take the risk on me and I will FE as soon as it arrives.<br /><br /><br />Did I mess up?&nbsp; Maybe there shud be a sticky to warn people about this I dunno...&nbsp; &nbsp;:p

				1- FE can be quite a scam sometimes. BE CAREFUL. Use respected vendors only.<br /><br />2- You can still FE by going to the orders tab and clicking the &#039;Finalize&#039; button.<br /><br />3- Vendors don&#039;t bite. Message them. Talk to em. These guys are providing a service.<br /><br />4- Welcome to the SR, stay safe and don&#039;t be stupid. :D

There is a LOT you need to read in the Shipping and Security sections. Vendor accounts cost 150$.<br /><br />Also, worrying is normal, you&#039;re mail ordering drugs. :P

				LOL&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />OK yeah that quite expensive - I didn&#039;t realise vendors paid to start!<br /><br /><br />I notice you never finalise early?&nbsp; &nbsp;but many of the top vendors require it?&nbsp; &nbsp;do you just never use them?

				If you are going to FE for anyone take ten minutes of your time and do a little research on the user, that can be done here at the forums using the search function. Also check their profile page and see what people are saying. Avoid if they don&#039;t have their PGP in their profile. <br /><br />:)

There have been a few BIG scams here where a lot of people lost a lot of money. Guess why? Well, reason A is that the scammer is a douchefag. Reason B is that they released their funds from escrow. (FE)<br /><br />There are plenty of amazing vendors who dont require it. Some ASK for it, in which case I usually will simply because I know it can suck to sell something and not get paid for it for a week.
