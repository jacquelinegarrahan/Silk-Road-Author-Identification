				so i am starting a group as the name implies. at this time, the group is for USA vendors only, but i hope that offshoots will sprout up in other countries. <br /><br />membership to the group is easy as you only have to follow a few simple rules. rule number one should be obvious, but ill list it anyway:<br /><br />1. Vow to only require a buyer to FE responsibly and with good reason<br />2. Always use delivery confirmation numbers (DCN)<br />3. Encourage proper use of the escrow system<br />4. Encourage proper use of the feedback system<br />5. Encourage proper use of the forums<br />6. Protect yourself from scammers<br /><br />1. Vow to only require a buyer to FE responsibly and with good reason<br />this serves several purposes. the first is that FE is against SR rules. secondly, it gives the buyer an extra layer of security and comfort to know that the seller will come through. it also should be forcing you to take a look at the buyers stats and develop a standard operating procedure for selling based on those stats. take responsibility.<br /><br />2. Always use delivery confirmation numbers (DCN)<br />dcn is not a tracking number. the slips are free in any post office and add 85 cents to the cost of postage and its well worth it. they are very useful when trying to figure out what went wrong with any bad orders. they give you a tangible proof that you did send the product. it also works against scam vendors who would try the old fake letter trick with the dcn. SR support would spot this very easily in the resolution center and revoke any seller account doing it. a vendor with a history of packages arriving that has a dcn looks a lot better in the resolution center than the scammers new account with no previous buying history.<br /><br />3. Encourage proper use of the escrow system<br />people seem to forget that the escrow system is there for a reason. its so that quality vendors will rise to the top, and scammers will fall by the wayside. its not perfect, but when used correctly, it works. <br /><br />4. Encourage proper use of the feedback system<br />it is not well known across the road that you can finalize an order without leaving feedback. its not posted in the buyers/sellers guides. a protip that should be passed along. proper use of the feedback system is essential. posts of &quot;FE will update&quot; that are never updated are damaging to the community. proper feedback form should be emphasized, but not required.<br /><br />5. Encourage proper use of the forums<br />so much knowledge locked away here with a search function as the key. most of us already post links to our forum review links. <br /><br />6. Protect yourself from scammers<br />take responsibility and use common sense to not let yourself be scammed. too often now scammers are taking the face of trusted partners. never build up so much trust as to think the other person will never scam you, no matter how long youve done business or how well you know them. the ones closest to you as the old saying goes.&nbsp; dont sell $2k of product to someone with 30 buys that only spent $20. start of smaller with new buyers, even if they have a very good previous history. break down large shipments into several smaller ones. think first, act second.<br /><br />what does this accomplish? it provides buyers with a reference to truly trusted vendors that are confident enough in their product and shipping method, that escrow only makes them shine even brighter. it also gives vendors an extra layer in disputes to say im a member of this group, we dont ask anyone to finale early because we are the trusted sellers, i have my dcn and i know that item arrived. it also makes it tougher for the common scammer because he knows he is not dealing with a common vendor. <br /><br />if you would like to join, follow the rules above, and add this tag to your profile page and pm me here or on SR and ill add your name to the list here. be sure to include a link to your vendor profile page or you will be added to the supporters list instead. the tag:<br /><br />Proud Member of USA S.A.F.E. (Sellers Against Finalizing Early) <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41740.0<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And now the list of USA S.A.F.E. Vendors (alphabetical):<br /><br />funyankeeguy<br /><br /><br />USA S.A.F.E Supporters (chronological):<br /><br />*pm me to be the first*

				Ugh, maybe it&#039;s just the negative bob in me, but I this is surely going to fail &lt;.&lt; Sorry to burst Your bubble :c That is, because of a simple reason: vendors would rather get the money up front than waiting for it to sit at escrow.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I have only asked one person to FE, ever. That person had a refund rate above 50% and an auto finalization rate above 40% I pride my self on taking all orders and not asking people to FE, but this one was outside my comfort zone. <br /><br />Odd, when I told him he would have to FE he opted to take his business elsewhere. <br /><br />The point is, I would only ask some one to FE if there stats were so far out of whack that I had no confidence in them.<br /><br />I do disagree with the way many vendors are using FE. Asking everyone new to FE is a bit much. I also believe it has it&#039;s use, some one with bad stats trying to establish a better rep would be one.<br /><br />

				the vendor shouldnt list a product for sale if he isnt prepared to wait for the escrow. quality vendors are aware of this. really low level shady guys are the ones that need that money right away. maybe its just an opinion but a vendor should have enough of a buffer that the money in escrow is like money in the bank. a quality vendor with a solid history should look at money in escrow the same as money in his/her pocket. i think this group will help establish a new breed of vendors and buyers.<br /><br />quotes arent working for me but maybe a better answer than asking him to FE would be to start off with a small order, or breaking it up into smaller shipments. perhaps then you could have still made the sale. or perhaps as the customer didnt buy from you anyway, and maybe his intention was to scam. in which case he wouldnt have accepted your offer of a smaller order anyway. in which case you refuse to deal with him. in either case, you are not scammed, and you never have to ask to FE.<br /><br />it can be done. you just have to think with your head and not your wallet.

				To be honest, I am not worried about the wallet at all. I am only worried about scammers. <br /><br />I have no issue with the escrow, or waiting tell it auto-finalizes. Hell, I can go months with out even cashing out my bitcoin. Money is not the issue.<br /><br />It was a small order (Under $25) It could not have been broken up any more than it was.<br /><br />The point was, his options were simply FE or no-sale. I would have turned down the sale all together, but if he was willing to FE then I was willing to take the chance on him.<br /><br />That, in my book is where FE comes into play. When a sale would not normally happen due to a lack of trust of the buyer based on his or her stats. Not for everyone that is new but for the select few that have VERY bad stats and are trying to improve them. <br /><br />So, in 99.999% of the instances Ill take all orders and everything is in escrow. However, I would rather give someone with really bad stats the chance with an FE than turn them down all together.<br />

				Im all for Escrow, 100 percent.. But it has been known for vendors to get scammed. It totally sucks, especially when you are dealing with a high ticket item. <br /><br />I experimented. I had two prices, one totally within escrow and one FE.. Of course the FE price was cheaer and the in escrow had limits. But I gave them a choice. You would think that this squashed the issue.. Not even close, I was reported to DPR many times because people thought I demanded FE and was a scammer.. Didn&#039;t take brain surgeon to look and see that I wasn&#039;t... <br /><br />So now, when I vend, I will keep it in escrow but as buyers know, that they would never have an issue with me. As with most honest vendors, but still I like escrow, its there to protect both parties. I just wish we lived in a perfect world where everyone is honest.

				The problem isn&#039;t with FE, it is with vendors expecting or even requiring it. As I have said, I know there are scam buyers out there, but do you think that if you added up all the scam buyer &quot;takings&quot; you would even come close to holding a candle to Tony76? Fuck no it wouldn&#039;t. FE is what built Tony76, so the only way to kill him is to cut off his food supply, and that supply is FE!

				I have not asked anyone to FE and don&#039;t plan on it. It is a challenge to commit to *never* using it though under any circumstances. Like air-dropping a pallet of coke from an airplane at night... I am probably going to want you to FE for that.<br /><br />One option might be that SR limits the number of FEs per vendor. Maybe you get one FE for every X number of sales. This would prevent a culture of FEing every order but still empower the vendors to protect themselves when needed. Who has the potential to abuse the system? Every vendor that has ever or may ever require FE for a specific transaction OR the vendor who requires FE for every transaction?<br /><br />Buyers need to feel safe to transact here if we are going to flourish. I think the simplest solution is for buyers to not participate in FE transactions. I question how often FE is used for mischief because of its popularity amongst buyers. Why are so many buyers using it if it is such a big problem? <br /><br />Maybe it could be as simple as making an option to filter out FE listings when searching. This gives an advantage to the vendors who do not FE as they would get differentiation for the added security and stability they are offering the marketplace. If a vendor did not label his item as FE when making the listing then they buyer would not be able to FE.

				Thanks for starting this thread. I was just thinking of how to start it myself with any credibility, seeing that I am a buyer only and haven&#039;t been on the road all that long. My reputation is 100% but this is still a topic better started by a vender.<br /><br />I recently went shopping for a small amount of personal use hash and was not happy to see how many more venders require FE on all orders. The logic being that most buyers are scammers waiting to happen and that all venders are above reproach. The escrow system is in place to protect both parties.<br /><br />I especially find the &quot;all the orders that I ship with a DCN arrive, this proves that I ship all the orders without a DCN&quot; logic to be amusing. No, no it doesn&#039;t prove that. It proves that you ship when you are accountable and that using a DCN prevents you from being ripped off as well. Escrow + DCN = Profit!<br /><br />Back to my small order of hash: I ended up going with BigBill for close to x2 what it would have cost me to order from some of the amazingly cheep, but FE required, newer venders. I once had an order from BB get lost in the mail. He was all set to reship when it finally arrived. I immediately messaged him to hold off, before I even had a chance to try it.&nbsp; A few hours later I finalized. <br /><br />

				The escrow system is the best attempt so far to protect from scams. It&#039;s not perfect, nothing is but here&#039;s my take on escrow and DCN.<br />There are a few&nbsp; main arguments about not using Escrow. One is &quot;I can&#039;t afford to have that much money out, and if I get more money up front then I can purchase larger quantity&#039;s for a better deal and pass the savings to the buyer while increasing my bottom line&quot; <br />And the other is &quot;If I as a seller make someone FE then I surely protect myself against buyers trying to scam me&quot;<br />Now starting with the first argument. I empathize with sellers not having enough resources to allow product to float around for days (or sometime weeks at a time for international orders). But if your small time and can&#039;t afford to float product then don&#039;t be a vender IMO. Or only sell a limited amount of orders using escrow and DCN&nbsp; until you build up a large enough product reserve to play with the big boys, then you can increase your orders. As a buyer I refuse to use venders that require everyone to FE. Temptation is a muther fucker and what&#039;s gonna stop someone from just cashing out their new money, making 100% profit and (after coming back from a vacation on the beach and banging hot sluts) setting up a new vender account. Nothing would stop someone from doing that. And if you&#039;re a vender that requires FE it has to cross your mind even if you don&#039;t act on it. So.....<br />I agree with using escrow and DCN, add some of Nomads common sense and you can&#039;t go wrong. There&#039;s no temptation for a vender to run off with everyone&#039;s cash taking a cross country trip systematically collecting hickies from strippers as souvenirs unless it&#039;s as result of legit business and not scamming.<br />And there&#039;s less incentive for a scammer to try if DCN&#039;s are involved.&nbsp; It&#039;s not perfect but it lowers the incentive and temptation for scams on both sides so it&#039;s a benefit.<br />There will always be the alternate acronym for S.A.F.E (Someone Always Fucks Everything up) but we do what we can right?<br />

				Knowing that SR needs the escrow system to work as well as it does (flawed or not) this idea is interesting and I keep coming back to it. Keep reading this thread.<br /><br />But I still maintain that while I have never asked a buyer to F.E I would not want to feel like I surrendered my ability to do so (even if not 100%) for what feels like no gain to me.<br /><br /><br />Joining some club or adding &quot;S.A.F.E.&quot; to my vendor profile just doesn&#039;t do it for me. As I said I would allow SR to take away my ability (as a vendor) to make buyers FE if there was a tangible benefit.<br /><br />P.S. - From my buyer days. There is TONS of money that I had that never got put on to SR, because of a vendor requiring FE. I would have spent about 10,000 on New computer equipment on here by now (Macs and what not), but the only people selling wants F.E. So I have never bought any.

Here is an example folks, of a top tier vendor who uses their head, not their wallet. Why are vendor getting scammed? Because they are taking a risk with a buyer who is new, has spent little, has high auto/refund rates. As a vendor, use your head and don&#039;t sell to these people deny them service. Have a threshold where you are willing and not willing to risk and then blame scams after that on your set limits rather than good/all&nbsp; buyers. Another way to &#039;use your head and not your wallet&#039; is to only require certain buyers to FE. Again, this will time time, effort and service but then again if your thinking by using your wallet, you should probably be providing some sort of service, no?<br /><br />I totally agree with this thread idea and support it 100%. Vendor should be proud that take effort in their service and are loyal to the system so that we all can benefit greatly.

And one of eternal evangelism to that end.<br /><br />Sorry, I get carried away but.........pacts for no FE don&#039;t fit in that. SR does though. And the rules as per the owner are a good compromise that at once leave all free to go out and form their own site or stay here and enjoy the benefits/quirks of escrow or the thrill of taking fate into one&#039;s own hands and working without a net, on a transaction by transaction basis.<br />Seems as close to perfect as it gets considering the challenges to me.<br /><br />I took my FE lumps early and again later. I&#039;ll still FE. When I can afford the risk and the value of FE to me is worth it, at that time.<br /><br />Better to spend time writing a primer &quot;How to spot the next 420 scam, short time scammers and bad buyers&quot;.<br />Educate to the best of your skill and the last of your strength and use your actions as an example.<br />If it&#039;s good people will act in harmony of their own will. Except people who just want to win an argument. They will flame you and give you bad karma LOL.

				I am a buyer, not a vendor, but I do have many years experience running a business and selling online. Here is my 2 cents.<br /><br />If you are asked to finalize early, even if a newb, buy from a different vendor!<br />&nbsp;<br />Per SR &quot;Buyers Guide&quot;, I will NEVER FE for product again, I don&#039;t need the stress of &quot;Have I been ripped off or not&quot;.<br /><br />I know there are those who disagree, but a pro seller should not have to get money in advance to keep their stock alive, if you can&#039;t afford to keep stock on hand, that is terrible business practice, and a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; Basically, if you don&#039;t have something to sell, then don&#039;t list it.<br /><br />That is why escrow is there. Not only to protect buyers, but to protect sellers as well.<br /><br />There are too many great, professional sellers here to take a chance with your money.<br /><br />Just remember, if you do FE, and there is a problem with the transaction, you have virtually NO recourse. Your bitcoin/money is gone, and you have no product to show for it. Let&#039;s face it, this ain&#039;t eBay or Amazon, in those marketplaces, if there is a problem, you have other avenues to recover your funds.<br /><br />Supposedly sellers ask for FE because of too many canceled orders. There is a term that is used in the business world, it is called &quot;customer liability&quot;, which means basically, if you are in business, you MUST expect some customer liability, you have to build that into your long term plan. How many vendors here actually have a &quot;long term plan&quot;. You have to factor in some percentage of loss when selling, that is a given. Sellers must factor that in when they estimate their profit margin. If you are doing business on per transaction, per sale profit margin, you are not going to stay around for very long, because you have not factored that liability into your profit margin. Of course there is a margin of error, but if you allow for that loss, in pricing, shipping, supply, etc. you will &quot;most&quot; always show a quarterly profit. How much customer liability do you think a company like Walmart deals with quarterly? I know, this isn&#039;t Walmart, but the model works for any business, no matter the size. Succesful vendors should have some idea of customer liability when doing business, especially on SR. But, sadly, this isn&#039;t a perfect world, and as with any business, they come and go, but planning on this liability would seem to be more essential here, than anywhere. After all, as a seller, here or mainstream, you do have the right to refuse to do business with anyone you choose.<br /><br />If you have to cancel an order, there must be a reason, or maybe you just changed your mind, SO WHAT!? You have that right, that&#039;s why SR gives you that option.<br /><br />If you have never read the SR buyers guide, I would highly recomend you take the time to do so. Read the entire thing. SR has taken great pains and time to set things up, as best possible for non legal transactions, to protect the safety, money, and reputation of buyers and vendors alike.<br /><br />It takes a lot for me to leave any feedback less than 5/5, but waiting on an order, with zero communication/response from the vendor, supposedly shipped via Priority Mail, for 8 or 9 days is pushing it.. Basically, I am fucked out of $100 bucks, just for being a newb. DUH, WHAT WAS I THINKING?<br /><br />I hope this provides some sort of insight, good or bad, but, like I said, &quot;Just My 2 Cents. <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Peace!

				As a buyer I&#039;m certainly in favor of this, and hopefully it catches on. I&#039;d also like to see other buyers stop giving business to those who always require FE (even when their transaction history is solid). That indicates to me that the seller doesn&#039;t have the necessary capital to maintain his business if he needs the money right away. Also, it&#039;s an unbalanced way to share risk: the buyer is on the hook almost exclusively if something goes wrong, and has to depend on the seller to return his money if the package gets lost/stolen.

				after reading all of the posts made in this thread i first want to thank everyone for your generous input. i have come to the understanding that the idea of SAFE is good, but its not perfect. i think a better type of vendor organization is one that promotes a better understanding and the proper use of the escrow system (i.e. when you should or should not FE), the feedback system (i.e. that you can finalize without leaving feedback), and the forums (i.e. search for your vendors review threads), etc. <br /><br />the reiteration of SAFE would not require vendors to absolutely never need to have a buyer FE, but instead would vow to use it responsibly. i am going to update the OP to reflect this.

				I wouldn&#039;t sign a petition against early finalization, but neither would I abuse the privilege.&nbsp; Here are the Grand Wizard&#039;s recently updated shipping policies. <br /><br />- If someone wants me to mail their package first class instead of priority, I will do so if they finalize early.&nbsp; If the package does not arrive I will reship one time after 21 days.&nbsp; Should the second attempt at mailing fail, there will be no reship or refund.<br /><br />- I reserve the right to require early finalization on international orders should I start running into delivery issues to a particular country.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />- I might in the future run occasional SR forum specials which require early finalization, or offer extra product for those who FE.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like these policies you are free to order from somebody else or to upgrade your shipping to priority.&nbsp; And if you FE I will still do my best to make you a happy customer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly, I think a &quot;No Early Finalization Ever&quot; policy is like a &quot;No New Taxes Ever&quot; policy.&nbsp; It sounds good, but it may not apply all that well in practice.&nbsp; For one thing, it&#039;s going to make many vendors a lot more reluctant about doing international transactions.

				How about this instead - A list of all vendors in the form of a policy matrix.<br /><br />For example vendors A-Z:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vendor A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vendor B&nbsp; &nbsp; Vendor C&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />S.A.F.E. Member&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ....<br /><br />Profile threatens new&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes<br />buyers with ban list<br /><br />Requires 5 star reviews&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes<br />to continue business<br /><br />Guarantees message&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No<br />response within <br />48 hours<br /><br />Has one visible review <br />that describes quality of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No<br />product<br /><br />&lt;or whatever criteria is useful&gt;<br />

				It&#039;s pretty simple. In &quot;a few words from the Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; located at the top right on the SR Home Page, (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/about)&nbsp; he clearly states the following -<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Always use the escrow system! This can&#039;t be stressed enough. 99% of scams are from people who set up fake vendor accounts and ask buyers to pay them directly or release payment before their order arrives. This behavior should be reported immediately. If you do choose to do this, we will be completely unable to help you in the event of fraud.<br />2.&nbsp; Read the forum and the wiki. They contain a wealth of information and many in our forum community are eager to help a new member with a respectful attitude.<br />3.&nbsp; Start small. Do a few small trades until you are comfortable with the process before throwing all of your Bitcoins at a big purchase.<br /><br />If you follow these principals, you&#039;ll minimize the risks associated with using a website such as Silk Road.&nbsp; :)<br />&nbsp;
