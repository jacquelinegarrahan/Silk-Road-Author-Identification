				Hey everybody :)<br /><br />On the behalf of myself and other vendors I just wanted to say sorry for the delays in order processing and responses to messages.<br /><br />Over the last few days it has been nearly impossible to access SR and therefore it has also been nearly impossible for us vendors to get any work done.<br /><br />Please be patient with vendors, we&#039;re doing are best to work around the fact that access has been so sporadic.<br /><br />Much Love,<br /><br />:) :) Rocker :) :)&nbsp;

				Yes, I thought it was letting up but I was wrong, I have been unable to login at all today and only for a minute or so yesterday. This is not how I conduct business so any customers, if you are reading this, I am not ignoring you and will respond as soon as I am able to get on and reply.

				Agree with OP 100%, if you have attempted to message me I apologize. I had 5 new messages when I got on early this am but when attempting to check them was unable to get a connection. <br /><br />Once this is sorted out I will reply ASAP

				Hopefully everything gets back to normal soon.<br /><br />If I had to guess I&#039;d say that SR&#039;s main servers are probably located in the northeast and have been effected by the storms.<br /><br /><br />But hey that&#039;s just my guess :)<br /><br />Rocker

				Hey all,&nbsp; <br /><br />We too are unable to communicate with customers.&nbsp; In fact, there were a few orders that went out on Thursday but which we haven&#039;t been able to update as confirmed!&nbsp; You may be rolling balls before the system even tells you your package has been shipped, proving that computers do not know everything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like our fellow vendors, we feel terrible.&nbsp; If something is urgent, please message us here on the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is hard to not to turn to despair right now -- a lot of money for a lot of people is on the line.&nbsp; <br /><br />But we must keep faith ... that this story will have a happy ending ... which is, in the end, what faith or hope or whatever you call it really is ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

Glad to see vendors making an appearance on the forums to let customers know they are doing all they can to deal with the situation. I had actually funded my account thursday night and was planning on making an order with you (Rocker) for the first time after making the decision based on your stellar feedback, but the site was non-existent come early morning&nbsp; :( Lets hope this situation is only a hurdle and not some community disbandment. Good luck to all the vendors dealing with this.

				Your poor customers? My poor vendors - Scooby and Motherof2 have somewhere between 900 an 1k$ tied up in two orders with them. I cant login to finalize at all. I feel terrible. So good for 2 vendors too. If either of you read this, I have been trying really hard. Motherof2 - best hash I&#039;ve had yet potency / taste wise. <br />Scooby - oil is incredible, got around to both, some of the best I&#039;ve had. Purged well.
