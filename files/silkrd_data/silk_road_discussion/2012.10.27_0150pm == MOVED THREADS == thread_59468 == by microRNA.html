				If you cant find your topic, its because it didnt have anything to do with SR<br /><br />sorry, but I am trying to clean up the forum a little - and if your thread had nothing to do with the SR market and you can no longer find it in this category, please check where it belongs<br /><br />there were too many to post a redirection topic for each one, that would have defeated the purpose imo<br /><br />for those on the first page: <br />most of them (including those about bitcoins) were moved to off topic; the one about poppies and the ecstasy trial threads were moved to drug safety; the one about what your drug money is funding to P, E, &amp; L; the farmers market letter thread to security; claims about a vendor scamming to rumor mill<br /><br />PLEASE try to make your thread where it fits best, not in this category unless it is specifically talking about SR <br /><br />Thank you

				what is the issue?<br /><br />if you are going to post, please make sure it is meaningful and contributes to the community - if you want to make a comment just say it please... i dont understand what that face means <br /><br />this category is for discussion of silk road, because people dont seem to understand that their threads have been moved and so i courteously explained where they were moved to - do you have a problem with that?&nbsp;

				thread about amphetamine reactions, differences of H, and the one about drug combinations moved to drug safety<br /><br />all the requests for btc to off topic <br /><br />the thread about pgp and the one about bitinstant to security <br /><br />and the one about shipping to, guess what, the shipping subforum<br /><br />(because none of these mention SR)

				&quot;please respect his rules he wants to make&quot; ???<br /><br />i dont feel i am just making up rules - threads are supposed to go in certain subforums so people can find them <br /><br />another mod posted the same request before i even was granted these privileges and one reason i was made a mod was in reference to the threads that were out of place so i am just trying to help out and clean up the forum <br /><br />i would appreciate other members thoughts on this subject actually - maybe i should stop wasting my time if no one cares <br /><br />edit - offer for roxy and phenobarb moved to product offers
