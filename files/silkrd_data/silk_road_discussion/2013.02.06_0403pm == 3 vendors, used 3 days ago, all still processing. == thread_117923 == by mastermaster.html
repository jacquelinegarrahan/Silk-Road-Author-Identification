				They&#039;re supposed to &quot;Get around to it&quot; within 48 hrs. However, some don&#039;t always comply. I noticed over the weekend (which I give more leeway), I ordered Friday night, and out of 4 orders only one went &quot;in transit&quot; within a matter of hours &quot;Thank you Evilution&quot;&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Though I took into consideration it was the weekend, and everybody deserves to chill out Saturday into Sunday. <br /><br />So 3 days? Does that mean since Sunday or Monday? Also look at the time the order was received. Especially if you&#039;re in US and they&#039;re overseas. (was in my situation-just thinking of the variables)<br /><br />That being said, you might want to give them a PM asking &quot;is everything alright with my order&quot;? <br /><br />I&#039;ve had some that wanted FE because shipping from their particular country to mine is a higher risk, and would only mark it &quot;in transit&quot; if you put &quot;agree to FE&quot; in the 1st line of your address. - Though that&#039;s a pretty isolated incident, and that vendor actually is worth taking the chance, in my opinion. <br /><br />Could be any number of things. Keep checking, and refreshing your orders screen. - Reread the vendors profile page as well. Could be updated info, that they&#039;ll be away for a day or two, or something to that effect. <br /><br />The short answer is, it happens, thankfully not all that often. <br /><br />I know how frustrating it is. Especially if you were choosing between two vendors, and the one you picked is stalling on the shipping. You&#039;re stuck until those 3or 4 days pass that allow you to cancel. <br /><br />I wish they&#039;d drop that shit myself. If you change your mind, why shouldn&#039;t you be able to cancel?&nbsp; But I digress. :-\<br /><br />Hope that helps. It&#039;s the best I got at the moment! <br /><br />I wish you better luck in the future. <br /><br />Peace&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />jagfug<br /><br />&nbsp;

DMTDOODEELSD, CRYSTALMETHOD UK and SONIDRONE, sort your shit out. Turn around time is pathetic, you&#039;re running a business!.

				Still waiting for these to put my order into transit.<br /><br />Checked DMTDOODEELSD&#039;s profile page and he actually says he wont be shipping &#039;til later this week, so fair play.<br /><br />SonicDrone and Crystalmethod have not replied to any messages I&#039;ve sent. First time I&#039;ve seen a vendor that doesn&#039;t put your order into transit with a day or 2. Will be canceling these orders when the time comes around and I&#039;ll be warning people about my experience.<br /><br />Not professional at all in this day and age on SR.<br /><br />P.S Praise to MRMERLIN25 for his flawless service and products, excellent throughout.

Always research the forums feedback it&#039;s imperative as it will give you the most current information on the vendor. I&#039;ve dealt with vendors who don&#039;t have perfect feedback (90%+) and had great experiences with them, some vendors are large outfits and are dispatching 100&#039;s of transactions per week,&nbsp; no matter how great their product is or how fast they ship, somebody may not be satisfied for whatever reason, or it could be a rival vendor trying to bring the vendor&#039;s feedback rating down (unfortunately this happens sometimes). Also, if I see a new vendor who&#039;s quickly amounted &#039;too many&#039; 5/5 transactions quickly (unless they&#039;re for samples), I would be extremely cautious, it&#039;s very easy to fake feedback on a vendors page as there&#039;s no way of checking who&#039;s left the feedback (all it costs the faker to create their fake rep is SilkRoad&#039;s commission). I agree with you too, the vendors who update their vendors page regularly take their business seriously and want your customer satisfaction. If you&#039;ve stayed in escrow and your order is still processing for more than four days, you&#039;ll have the option to cancel your order, your Bitcoins held in escrow will be automatically refunded to you.
