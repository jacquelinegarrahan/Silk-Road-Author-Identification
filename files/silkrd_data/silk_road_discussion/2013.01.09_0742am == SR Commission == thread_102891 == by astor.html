				Title: <strong>SR Commission</strong><br />

				I noticed that people ask about the SR commission a few times a week, so I made these handy graphs<br /><br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/srcom/<br /><br />The first graph is the total SR commission in dollars and the second one is the SR commission as a percent of the product price.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it works. Let&#039;s say the product costs $200. You find 200 on the x-axis and move in a straight line up until you reach the blue line, then move in a straight line left until you reach the y-axis (I drew some grid lines to help you along). You&#039;ll intersect somewhere between $16 and $17. If you do the actual math, it&#039;s $16.50, but this gives you a good estimate, no calculator required.<br /><br />The grid lines are every $50 on the x-axes, and $2 or 0.5% on the y-axes.

				I thought it was a fixed commission, the curve on the graph seems to indicated higher priced items have smaller fees?<br /><br />What are the actual rules that commisions are based off of?

				Great information as when I have to cancel larger orders (most recently because a buyer put his name down a Sylvester Stallone) and after I cancelled his order he was dismayed with me saying I pocketed the some money from him. I explained this situation but the buyer didn&#039;t want to hear it.<br /><br />At least now we&#039;ve identified a rough of the fees they&#039;ll incur - Thanks for the 411<br /><br />ce

				Awesome Astor - thank you!<br /><br />Crazy Eights: I don&#039;t think SR takes their commission if the order is cancelled. As I understand it the &#039;missing money&#039; is due to the vendor hedging their escrow account.

				@Tessellated <br /><br />The commission is <br /><br />$0 - 50&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp; 10%<br />$50 - 150&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp; 8.5%<br />$150 - 300&nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; 6%<br />$300 - 500&nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; 3%<br />$500 - 1000 -&gt; 2%<br />$1000+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; 1.5%<br /><br />BTW, I put bigger, more detailed graphs up. If you click on the graphs you get the bigger ones. :)<br /><br />

That&#039;s what the buyers see. The original graphs were based on the initial price. I have updated them so you can look it up either way. It&#039;s not much different. In my original example, the total price is $216.50, which has a commission of $16.50, while a total price of $200 has a commission closer to $15.50.<br /><br />But hey I&#039;m pedantic. :)<br />
