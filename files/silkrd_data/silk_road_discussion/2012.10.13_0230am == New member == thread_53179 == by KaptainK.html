				Hey SR, firstly I want to say that I am simply amazed at the market/community and the bastion of liberty, respect, and professionalism that it is!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;To introduce myself a bit, I am currently studying biochem/chem eng with plans for eventual graduate work in psychopharmacology.&nbsp; I am primarily interested in psychedelics and dissociatives so any pointers towards good vendors in that regard would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Iboga and Ketamine are especially impossible to find in my area&nbsp; :-\

I would recommend you go with him for your Iboga needs.<br /><br />Best of luck on your SR travels!<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				grahamgreene covered your iboga needs very nicely. However, in the future, just read through some of the feedback a vendor has. Additionally, most vendors typically have a thread either in the Rumor Mill or Product Offers subforums that can usually be found in their SR profile information. Be sure to check those threads out for any vendor you&#039;re interested in as they often have great and detailed information about everything form communication and packaging to shipping times and product quality.<br /><br />Welcome and stay safe.<br />.Hades.
