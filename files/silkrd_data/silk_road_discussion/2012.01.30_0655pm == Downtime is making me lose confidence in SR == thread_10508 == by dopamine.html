				I don&#039;t think just because someone is new that their points are invalid.<br /><br />I have the utmost respect for SR and its operators but a small official notice letting us know what is going on and perhaps a rough timeline for getting the site back in full gear, which would take 5 mins to put together, would put a LOT of people at ease.<br /><br />Like many peeps I&#039;m in the middle of transactions as a buyer so I can only imagine the stress the vendors must be under.<br /><br />Meanwhile the BTC price fluctuates so that adds another point of stress to the whole situation.<br />

				I&#039;ve yet to see any signs that would lead me to believe the problem is with the site itself. When a server gets overloaded the first thing to go tits up tends to be the database in my experience (runs out of memory or connections). Even with error reporting turned off, there would still be symptoms of this occuring. In reality, most of the downtime I&#039;ve seen on here coincides with overloaded nodes preceeding SR&#039;s server. Even my clearnet sites get a lot of traffic from assholes running port scans, database injection scanners, and people trying to ddos sites so you can imagine the amount of garbage traffic aimed at Sr on any given day and it is beyond their control. The same shit gets thrown at sites like Facebook every day. They just have the budget to have enough capacity to shake it off easily.

				Here&#039;s a thought: don&#039;t like it? Leave. Or at least make constructive criticism instead of whining as if you&#039;re entitled to something. Silk Road isn&#039;t the only drug market on Tor. Maybe the BMR or Farmer&#039;s Market will be more to your liking? Or you can go to Freenet. Or you can track down individual vendors who operate out of their own websites. Or you can buy from your friendly neighborhood drug racket. There&#039;s many options for you to choose from, and most of them accomplish a lot more than senseless bitching.

It may simply be the somewhat flaky infrastructure of Tor hidden services. You are that you run multiple servers with 99.99+% uptime - but are any of those servers set up as a Tor hidden service? Probably not.

				Crankiness aside, there are some valid concerns raised in this thread, but SR isn&#039;t even a year old yet.<br /><br />Amazon will be militant about letting people know when site upgrades and downtime are coming, but honestly, I&#039;d rather NOT have SR update us on every stage of the hardening process, for no other reason than SR&#039;s many enemies would relish info like that and most of us wouldn&#039;t understand it anyway.<br /><br />Darwinism exists in onionland too, if SR degrades a dozen wannabes will sprout up in its place.

				The random bouts of downtime should simply not be happening. If SR needs to take down the site for periods of time to work on it, that&#039;s fine but it needs to be announced ahead of time so vendors and buyers can plan accordingly.

				Some interesting points have been made as well as some pretty ignorant ones. I fully understand that SR is a constant work in progress as is the Tor network and .onion routing, but in all honesty it is getting much harder for me to trust significant amounts of money to a marketplace that has appeared and crashed nearly once every 24 hours with almost no communication (if any?) from admins. The increased paranoia is probably hurting business in the short and long run and it makes it harder and harder for sellers to gain the trust that many of them so rightly deserve. I&#039;m not pointing fingers but even just a placeholder page &quot;e.g. 404, under construction, we&#039;ll be right back&quot; would add, nearly double, the level of professionalism that SR already has. The random outages are even tolerable but it just keeps backing up my theory that there is some sort of DDossing occuring. Maybe i&#039;m wrong. Maybe I&#039;m crazy. All I really want is a quick message from an Admin every now and then. Just my 2cents.

				yall need to stop being pissy. way to much complaining going on. need to realize this whole site is a learning curve. and with new threats requires updates and planing. yes its been down lately, but just wait it out. SR is a great site. stop complaining jeez. if you do not like the downtime make you own site and get paid. if not shut up and buy.

You can ddos individual nodes on the tor network and any hidden service running behind them will suffer from it. On the vidalia control panel, select &quot;view the network&quot;. You have access to the ip addresses of nodes from this. If you were to pick one and ddos, everyone conected through it would suffer traffic degradation until they changed their route. Also take note of something else. A lot of nodes have shit bandwidth so it doesn&#039;t take much to overload their connection.<br /><br />If the issue was with the server itself, be it dedicated or vps or whatever, it would show different symptoms.

				there have been some good points made in the thread by others. those who said it&#039;s not as easy as running a standard website are right. i am sure it is much harder. but still SR should have another site for status updates or post them on here. they should respond to threads like this and address some of these issues.

				My personal concern is that, to my knowledge, there has not been an official notice regarding the sporadic downtime in the last few days.<br /><br />Although paranoia probably has the best of me I just wish we could be 100% sure that SR is still under control of the same people as before the current events.<br /><br />I would hate to find that in a couple of months down the track we find everything has been being recorded and a shitload of arrests are made.<br /><br />Please, please could we have an official notice?

				My tool located in my profile is always 100% accurate and is impossible to give a false reading watch it closely the only possible way it could give a false positive is if i lost power and internet to my server and even then it would give nothing because my hidden service would be down my tool is rather simple and by design is so simple that it would be impossible for it to fuck up :)

				There have been a lot of times that people&nbsp; have been reporting that SR has been down and I&#039;ve still been able to access it. Now during those times when it was reported to be down, I have noticed that sometimes it takes awhile to make that initial connection to get to the login screen, but once the initial connection is made and I&#039;ve logged in than I can continue to browse without any issues. Once I have disconnected&nbsp; from TOR, I seem to have issues connecting again for awhile. I&#039;m thinking that it&#039;s not an issue with SR servers, but more of an issue with the TOR relays that you are connected to reaching SR. If you are having problems, try clicking on &quot;Use New Identity&quot; in the Vidalia Control Panel, and continue to try accessing SR until you reach it....

				Warweed is right.&nbsp; SR is up and running just fine.&nbsp; I just think some of the machinery has been getting overloaded.&nbsp; I have tried logging on about ten times over the past twenty-four hours, and I have been successful five of those times.&nbsp; You just have to keep trying.&nbsp; I am logged in right now.<br /><br />I am not going to get involved in the other issues on this thread, but suffice to say that—as a non-seller—I have no complaints about the way SR handles outages and downtimes, and I do not think announcements are a good idea.<br /><br />I think the reason SR never came over here to the forums to mention anything is because SR never went down in the first place.&nbsp; It&#039;s just been really busy.&nbsp; Warweed&#039;s status updater seems to agree with that conjecture.
