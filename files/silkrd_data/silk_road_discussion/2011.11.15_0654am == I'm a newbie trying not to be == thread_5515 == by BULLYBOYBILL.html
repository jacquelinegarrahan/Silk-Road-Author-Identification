				Hello guys, I&#039;d first like to show appreciation to all those who&#039;ve traveled the SR before 8), making it possible for all who find it to procure the medicinal plants we need without the Govt&nbsp; &gt;:(having a hand in it. I&#039;d began perusing the different forums trying to learn the protocols of the site when a ? came to me. As a new customer, what if anything can I do to help earn the trust of the vendors? Should I limit the size/cost of my first few orders? Or is it just a matter of time before trust is built? Sorry if this question has been answered and I haven&#039;t found it yet. If so please point me to the link.<br />Thanks in advance,<br />BBB

				You must remember young padawan the place we are.&nbsp; Trust is very hard to come by in these parts and rightly so I would say.&nbsp; <br />First off being courteous in any conversation will get you further than the alternative.<br />Secondly it helps if you remember to finalize your purchase in a timely manner therefore enabling vendors to continue bringing us their wares in a timely manner.<br />Thirdly :o Due to the rash of scams going on these days most vendors require an early finalization for new buyers to cover their butts. <br />&nbsp;I would make sure if you are releasing early for any vendor due to your newness it is an established vendor with great feedback, long history,&nbsp; and one who is active on the forums with a thread or two attesting to their legitimacy.<br />Some other notes: don&#039;t be too eager, as NomadBloodbath likes to say &quot;eager beaver&quot; syndrome, can cause you to make rushed/bad decisions.<br />Don&#039;t forget about your gut, listen to your instincts. They usually wont steer you wrong<br />Stay safe and have fun.<br />that&#039;s all from me i&#039;m sure there will be more.

				Welcome to the Road, BULLYBOYBILL<br /><br />Be sure to read SR wiki. Volunteers are working hard to collect information to make life easier for those who are making first steps here.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page <br /><br />I am sure you&#039;ll find answers to most of the questions you might have there.<br /><br />I can give you a few tips:<br />◄ Pick a vendor carefully. For my first purchases I choose vendors who are in Top20<br />◄ Choose vendors what are in the same continent/country. If you&#039;re from USA and you&#039;re ordering XTC from NL you are facing real risk of your order being intercepted by customs. You want your refund rate as low as possible.<br />◄ Try and build relationships with vendors. If you&#039;re buying from the same vendor all the time he will likely remember you.<br />◄ You might be asked to release funds early. That is one good reason to keep first few orders small. Read vendors profile and his policies concerning new buyers. Pick a vendors that is considered trustworthy by community.<br /><br />Best of luck. Share your buying experiences here on forums and help others on picking a vendor:)<br /><br />Bob.

				+1 to Bob.&nbsp; Great tips.&nbsp; I can&#039;t stress enough how easy it is to get scammed.&nbsp; I got scammed by a trusted seller, who I was sure it was ok to release funds early to.&nbsp; But, thankfully, it was a small order.&nbsp; Great idea to keep your first orders small until you really trust yourself with the process.&nbsp; I also ordered a few cheap digital goods at first to 1.) Practice with the process of transactions and PGP and 2.) Boost my profile a little so vendors might have a wee bit of trust that I wasn&#039;t out to scam them (and 3.&nbsp; Show my hubby some good stuff that can come out of SR ;) ).<br /><br />Welcome and have fun!

				The simple fact that you came to the forums before purchasing is in your favor.&nbsp; Most people seem to be so excited to be here, they just purchase the first drugs they like, without knowing whether it is a reputable seller or not.&nbsp; As has been said, take your time, and make sure to investigate, in Rumor Mill and other places, the vendor&#039;s name.

				I was in the top 5 at one point. Now 30-40. Idk or care. So being in the top 20 in nice... it really is only one small indicator. Your ratings suffer if you take a break and repeat customers account for less weight on the rating. A TON of my business is repeat, so my ranking doesn&#039;t move much.&nbsp; AND you will NOT find a vendor MORE honest than me. You may find one with the same but not more.&nbsp; So top 20, eh. It&#039;s all about how long you&#039;ve been around and what you&#039;ve done in that time.<br /><br />IF YOU are asked to release escrow early, SAY NO. Real simple. OR you got 2 choices. 1) Go ahead and get ripped-offed. 2) YOU BETTER HAVE AND CHECK the dcn (delivery confirmation number) for priority USPS or a tracking number for EXPRESS delivery.&nbsp; IF you do not have either of those than you are screwed. BE SAFE- STAY WITHIN ESCROW.<br /><br />I remember when I first started. The ONLY thing I asked is if the address looked funny or didn&#039;t check out on ?maps was it correct? A few days later... POW, BTC in my account w/cool comments. I NEVER ASKED for btc up front. I stayed w/in the system and EVERYBODY stays happy. NOOBS, stop finalizing early. Please. When buyers get scammed there is less btc for the good vendors. AND I NEVER PUT A LIMIT ON AN ORDER!! WHAT IS UP W/THAT? <br /><br />Vendors: Are you here to make money? Then sell that shit! &quot;No, limit of 2.&quot; WTF? If I want to buy all your remaining stock then you should sell it. STOP limiting me/other buyers. I hate that shit! Someone wants ALL of what I have and they pony up the dough, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!&nbsp; ;D That&#039;s what it&#039;s about. So What? 50 people didn&#039;t get to order from you? They will be looking next time. In the mean time you are flush w/btc b/c 1 dude stepped up. Great. SELL to the ones who have and are willing to spend. Stop selling 1-3pieces at a time IF you don&#039;t have too.&nbsp; One of my FIRST orders were for 20 oxycodone 30mg tablets. I couldn&#039;t believe it! I packaged that ship up and sent it out. No problem. Now 20 is an everyday thing. Helps to have a good rep! :D<br /><br />END RANT: thanks for hanging in there w/me. Oh, what are they going to say now?
