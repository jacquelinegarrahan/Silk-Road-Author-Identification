If you&#039;re in the US, you&#039;re far more likely to receive a controlled delivery than, say, if you live in Angola.<br />Second would be where the packages arrive, third would be the nature of the packages. Frequent small packages from a PO box are much less suspect than large packages delivered to your house addressed to your name.<br /><br />Just use common sense, read the security forum and minimize your exposure wherever you can.<br /><br />Peace,<br />G

				haha <br />that angola comment floored me..!!<br /><br />Spread out your drops, use multiple locations, spread bigger orders over smaller multiple ones. Write RTS (return to sender) and leave it in place for 24 hours<br /><br />you should be pretty well covered

I really don&#039;t see a problem with ordering a lot, I&#039;m always receiving priority and express packages to my house because of my business. The orders I receive from SR are packages just like any other package I would receive and there&#039;s no reason for the mail man to suspect anything. <br /><br />It&#039;s good to be on top of your game and to make sure you&#039;re careful when it comes to ordering drugs and such...but sometimes too much paranoia can actually be a bad thing. I&#039;ve seen plenty of friends IRL get arrested because they were so paranoid purchasing drugs that they stuck out like a sore thumb and did things that they normally wouldn&#039;t do that raises flags.
