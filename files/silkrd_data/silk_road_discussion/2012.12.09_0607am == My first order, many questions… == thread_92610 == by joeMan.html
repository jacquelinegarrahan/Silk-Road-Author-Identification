				I never ordered anything on silk road and honestly I&#039;m really afraid. I don&#039;t want to get in jail. So does anyone know, what happens if I order 10 ecstasy pills and the police finds out about it? Is it a huge criminal offense in Germany? I never took drugs before and just want to try it out. I also don&#039;t plan to order regularly.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t know to which address and name I should send the pills. As far as I know there are three options:<br />1. Real name and real address: If the police finds out, I can tell them that I didn&#039;t order the drugs and somebody else did. They have no prove, that I ordered them.<br />2. Fake name and real address: It&#039;s suspicious and I don&#039;t have an alibi later on.<br />3. Fake name and fake address: Absolutely no idea how I should do it.<br /><br />I plan to buy the pills only from domestic dealers. How high the the risk that somebody opens the package/envelope and/or finds out about it? Does the post office opens normal envelope shipments at all (in Germany)?<br /><br />And last but not least: If I received my package the risk isn&#039;t over, is it? There are two risks I can think about:<br />1. Silk road gets uncovered (by the fbi, police, anonymous, etc.) and they know my name/address. I know that you can encrypt your address, but is there really no way that the investigators find out about me?<br />2. The highest risk I can think about: The dealer gets uncovered. The chance isn&#039;t so low, is it? The police is searching for dealers…<br />What happens then? Do the dealers save the buyer names and address on there computer or slips? Do they need to tell the police about there buyers?&nbsp; Is the police interested in buyers how bought only 10-20 pills?<br /><br />Thanks in advance and sorry for my many questions.

				*NEVER SIGN FOR ANYTHING*<br /><br />Definitely use your real address.&nbsp; The name kinda depends on your living situation...if you have an rental that still gets mail from old tenants you can probably use a fake name without problems. If your family has lived on the same farm for 30 years and never gets mail for other people it might be better to use your real name..<br /><br />Not sure about German drug laws but 10 x pills isn&#039;t much in the grand scheme of things.&nbsp; If for some reason you get caught, the police/prosecutor would have to be really bored to bring charges against you (although of course they can for even one pill). Buy from a reputable dealer with lots of good feedback about their product and shipping and there should be no reason for anyone to open your package.&nbsp; Ive only bought weed from SR but I&#039;m amazed at some of the concealment methods. Pills should be even easier.&nbsp; Even got weed from SA through customs.<br /><br />&nbsp;SR automatically&nbsp; deletes names and addresses as soon as the vendor marks tour item &quot;in transit&quot;. Its against SR rules to save personal info, but you can never really be sure who you&#039;re dealing with on here (the beauty and the bitch of it)<br /><br />Stay safe, use discretion, look up vendors in the forums to get feedback (don&#039;t do solely on their number as this can be manipulated) and you&#039;ll be fine.

				Depending on what vendor you choose, some vendors require that you use your real name and address or they will not refund your purchase if it is intercepted. As a first order I recommend ordering from a reputable vendor that is domestic. A thread had a poll of the success percentage of packages. The success rate was approximately 96%.<br />In the end you have to decide whether you want to take the risk. Good luck!

				When first started using SR i used a fake name and real address but even though i received my orders i realized that using a fake name to sent up more red flags than anything else. since tben i have always used my real name.&nbsp; the way i look at it is if leo somehow finds me in possesion of an illegal substance its not going to matter much if my name is on it or not. i only order for personal use so i feel like the odds are in my favor and I never open the package until enough time has passed that i feel&nbsp; its safe to do so. &#039;<br />use you best judgment and read vendor reviews and dont FE. i am approaching 30 transactions and have never FE and never will.<br />welcome!

				Fake names and fake addresses can be major red flags, as previously stated. <br />Also there are several methods for retrieving the package/envelope, if you think it&#039;s that risky then you can always write RTS on it.<br />You&#039;ll have a day to decide if the coast is clear and grab it. If LE is hellbent on getting you for some reason then there is always plausible deniability, <br />pretend to have absolutely no knowledge of any package. Don&#039;t say it was someone elses, just be completely clueless. Stick to your right to remain silent.<br />Also there are several stickies about buying, you can also find information on the wiki. Extremely helpful.
