				chemical.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what happened, went to a festival and I was trying to find some lucy and molly.&nbsp; I used to sell molly before I moved so I know what good molly is, I found some but it didn&#039;t smell or taste anything like the real deal nor did it really do much.&nbsp; Threw away 30 on that.<br /><br />Eventually found 5 tabs of something.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t lucy, I knew it wasn&#039;t when I tasted it.&nbsp; Around an hour later, I couldn&#039;t see ANYTHING.&nbsp; I was so disorientated from the visuals I had to find a place to sit, I remember feeling that distinct feeling I always got on the 2cs, where your intestines feel out of your body and just nauseous as fuck.&nbsp; Eventually I did throw up but then I don&#039;t remember anything after that point.<br /><br />I usually can handle my psychs but obviously this is just beyond the point of human consumption.. any idea what it was?<br /><br />25i, right?<br /><br />considering I had that same 2c* feeling in my intestines and stomach<br /><br />and yes, I know, this was very irresponsible and I take full blame for it.&nbsp; Just makes you wonder how many dishonest people are out there and how RARE lucy and real molly is
