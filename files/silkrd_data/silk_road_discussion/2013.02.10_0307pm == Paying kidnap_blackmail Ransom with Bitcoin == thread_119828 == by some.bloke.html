				Anyone heard of this being done before?<br /><br />Pretty much the hardest part about pulling off a clean ransom payment is somehow depositing the $ without being caught in person or tracking the funds,<br /><br />Bit-coin seems perfect for crims. Scarily so. I would spend mine all on drugs lol

				Back in August, Anonymous claimed to have Mitt Romney&#039;s tax returns. They threatened to release them before the US election if the demand of $1,000,000 USD worth of bitcoin was not met. It was quite amusing considering they invited the public to also reach $1,000,000 in a separate wallet so they could be released before they were destroyed. A ransom game for both public and private interests. Full story and a ton more in-depth here:<br /><br />**clearnet**<br />http://news.discovery.com/tech/mitt-romneys-tax-returns-hacked-stolen-120905.htm<br /><br />DPR seems to be successful in acquiring his profit in bitcoin, so I&#039;m sure this could be achieved by others. Of course if you&#039;re fucking with the secret service directly, this might be a different story of whether or not the bitcoins can be cashed out anonymously!

				Bitcoins are not a great way of moving large amounts of cash.<br /><br />The anonymity is derived from your transaction being mingled with thousands of other transactions.&nbsp; However a single large transaction could be tracked fairly easily, it would be akin to looking at a snake that has just eaten a cat.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is now this huge lump working its way through the system.

				Yep. BTC are pseudo anonymous. They have to be mixed a shuffeld in order to become anoymous.<br /><br />I could track my btc right to my house.<br /><br />Right with a picture from google maps;<br /><br />http://htmlfive.appspot.com/static/whereami.html.<br /><br />Most people who have internet for a few years will most likely see their hometown or see the arrow even closer to their house.<br />You will have to give permission.<br /><br />On Pastebin and such site&#039;s is software to be found for owners of website&#039;s.<br />When pasted in the owner can see where the visitor is coming from.<br />No need to give permission, because the visitor will not see the hidden software that&#039;s comes with a automated permission.<br /><br />Under the button with the text &quot;&quot;NO&quot;&quot; can be a &quot;&quot;YES&quot;&quot; in the sourcecode.<br /><br />Over 50% of those who use http://htmlfive.appspot.com/static/whereami.html will see the arrow damn close to their house...<br /><br />Otherwise at least the nearest server will be pointed out with a arrow.<br /><br />Anyway my btc I could trace them back to this point;<br />http://htmlfive.appspot.com/static/whereami.html<br />And that is to close to send btc to my account.<br /><br />Thanks to Silkroad the btc&#039;s are going in to a mixer. So if you pay someone, that person is not receiving the very same btc that you have send in the first place. He/she will get some other btc instead.<br />I think it&#039;s for the best to not tell how to avoid this easy trace, because anybody, lunaticks who want to blackmail included.<br />The enemy is watching too.<br />Besides DPR doesn&#039;t like kidnappers , hostage takers , blackmailers etc.<br />And I don&#039;t like them either !<br /><br />Wasta <br /><br />

				To be honest, if your alter ego&#039;s Bitcoin can be traced to you, then your &quot;security measures&quot; simply suck like hell.

				Yep, this is very well possible now, no more risk of &quot;tracking the money&quot;, you can make a career of kidnapping and demanding ransom without any fear of getting traced from the money. Of course you can still get traced if you dont know what you&#039;re doing.

				Holding servers and phone systems for cyber ransom&nbsp; could wield good payouts.&nbsp; If its cheaper to pay the random . <br /><br />It could bring a new wave of hacks and real life exploits .&nbsp;
