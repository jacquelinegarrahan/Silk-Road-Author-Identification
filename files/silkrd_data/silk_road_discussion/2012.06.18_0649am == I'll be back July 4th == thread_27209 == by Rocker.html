				Hey guys as many of you know I&#039;ve been absent for a few weeks :(<br /><br />I hated having to do this but to much of my funds were tied up in BTC land for my comfort. Anyway by the beginning of July I should have at least a chunk of my BTC sorted and intend to be back with my mushrooms followed shortly by more MDMA. <br /><br />I may also start offering bulk (QP+) high grade herb to trusted SR users in the near future as well. Who would be interested in this and also what would you guys think would be fair pricing for it?<br /><br /><br />Much Love,<br /><br />Rocker

I can&#039;t comment on weed prices but I have been missing your MDMA and I&#039;ve only done your shrooms once and it was awesome.

				i thought of more questions for ya rocker. i asked above about the strains you may be bringing around i was also curious too for more details if possible, so a person could already have coins arranged if things sounded promising. mainly wondering like organic? and if you would know&nbsp; indoor/ green house / out door and if you could go as far as putting up a pic. maybe of the product? also you asked what price sounded fair so maybe the price ranges u were feeling? any info is much appreciated but im sure as your other products everything is A+

				As far as Weed goes its just in the planning stages now. I hope to start offering bulk to trusted buyers ONLY by the end of July. If I do at first it will all be indoor top shelf stuff hopefully for around 3500USD per pound and slightly less than a thousand for QPs. Come fall I hope to be picking up some high grade outdoor which should come with a very reasonable price tag attached.<br /><br />Rocker

				Aww, I was looking to buy shrooms from you for the 4th. <br />Oh well, I still have some of your MDMA left, should make for some fun, and I agree with DivineChemicals, Rocker&#039;s MDMA gives thee cleanest and smoothest rolls I&#039;ve ever had. :D<br /><br />Glad to hear you&#039;re coming back!<br /><br />sdesu
