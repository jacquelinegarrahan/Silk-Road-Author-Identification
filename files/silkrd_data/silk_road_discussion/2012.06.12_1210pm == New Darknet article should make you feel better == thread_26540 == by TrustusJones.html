				Came across this this morning, it is mostly a pedo bear story but it shows the feebs have their hands tied:<br /><br />link: http://gawker.com/5916994/dark-net-kiddie-porn-website-stymies-fbi-investigation (click at your own risk!)<br /><br />So he was probably horrified to find the kiddie porn hive on TSChan and went to the feds with the URL in hand. But if he expected them to leap into their black vans and speed off to bust some pedophiles, he was mistaken.<br /><br />From the report:<br /><br />&quot;Complaintant had no other information about who the subjects of the pictures were or who would have posted the pictures. Also, because everyone (all internet traffic) connected to the TOR Network is anonymous, there is not currently a way to trace the origin of the website. As such no other investigative leads exist.&quot;<br /><br />On August 2nd, 2011, the interviewing agent recommended the case be closed without further investigation, according to the documents.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t to say that people on the dark net are completely impervious. Some vigilante Anonymous hackers exposed the IP addresses of visitors to a dark net child porn site with an elaborate sting last year. And through careful infiltration, authorities were able to take down a dark net drug market not unlike the Silk Road called the Farmer&#039;s Market, in April. TSChan is also no more, apparently chased off the dark net by hackers, according to a note on the Hidden Wiki—it&#039;s been moved to a graveyard for &quot;defunct&quot; underage porn websites on the Hidden Wiki.

When I was wandering around I kept seeing shit like this floating around and it used to vex me to fuuuck. Not in any way saying the other Mods didn&#039;t do anything, of course they did, I just mean I wanted to join in and help mop up too. I dunno how people expect the outside world to take SR seriously when they talk about stuff like that, it casts a shadow on the place. The irony of it is that the people that do it call it out for being restrictive...but then they will moan when this place goes away because of it.

People are largely incapable of influencing their own sexual preferences. Pedophiles are entirely capable of not molesting children though. So if they cause no harm what is the point of demonizing and persecuting them? It is some primitive biological response wired into most humans brains I think, because it is certainly not at all rational to want to cause great damage to people who are entirely harmless. Child molesters deserve to be demonized and persecuted greatly, they have a choice and they choose to cause harm to others. Pedophiles are born pedophiles, and if they don&#039;t harm others I don&#039;t have anything against them. It is very bad to produce child pornography obviously, but I am entirely unconvinced that viewing it is bad, and I don&#039;t blame them for looking at things they find sexually arousing especially since I see it as causing no harm. There is no inherent cause and effect relationship between the act of people viewing child porn and increased rates of production. There are some distribution structures that lead to increased rates of production though. People who argue to keep these structures illegal have a bit more ground to stand on, although from a strict libertarian point of view even paying for child pornography or uploading child pornography should not be illegal, only production.

That sounds like precrime to me, pre-thought-crime in some cases (as CP possession crimes are essentially thought crimes)! What a scary concept! The concept of people taking pre-thought-crime seriously is far more scary to me than the idea of someone who has no plans to molest children anonymously looking at pictures on Tor.

It also allows people to form a strong group identification of being moral/&#039;good&#039; in situations in which they might otherwise be perceived as immoral/&#039;bad&#039; and that&#039;s probably a pressure as well. Note that you don&#039;t see anyone calling for this degree of protection for the mentally retarded, the profoundly/actively psychotic, and demented elders - yet, good news, everyone! {&lt;--sarcasm}&nbsp; there are small specialty pornography niches for each. And yet NO one is calling for protection there. In fact, no one&#039;s even brought those groups up, it&#039;s all Simpsons-style &#039;think of the children.&#039; Possibly because everyone here has former childhood experience on his or her resume and may be involved in the rearing of children, but more, I bet, because of the biological drive to protect kids.<br />Your argument&#039;s completely rational, particularly the choice aspect. However, it&#039;s not easy for some people, for personal or social reasons, to differentiate between those who *view* sexualized images of children and those who *rape* children or who have sexualized/exploiting relationships with children. In addition, the evil inherent in creating those images taints those who view the created images, even if they truly weren&#039;t involved in the creation. In the situation of a true CGI, I suspect you&#039;d get largely the same response and many people would still say &quot;shoot the bastard,&quot; although theRedArmy gets it when s/he says &#039;why not more digi-porn.&#039; (It&#039;s weird, you don&#039;t see the animal rights people screaming about hentai, but, then, I guess there aren&#039;t a lot of cephalod molestations...) Most people I talk with don&#039;t seem to be that aware of their own relationship with their own internal sexual lives and the relationship between fantasy and reality and/or their own pornography use and reality.&nbsp; On the other hand, most people scream loudly when there&#039;s discussion of taking away their video games and say that [whatever game] hasn&#039;t made them more prone to [stealing cars, shooting people, engaging in interstellar warfare / guild raids, dressing in armor in their off hours], and so maybe there&#039;s a way that people can start to internalize these ideas.<br /><br />Your links are good, your data&#039;s valid, and your facts are going to remain unpopular. CP viewers/consumers/whatever the term is are the current cultural&#039;Nazis&#039;/bad guys/avatars of evil. (This is NOT a Godwin&#039;s Law post, do not throw tomatoes at me for that, there are lots of other things that you can kick me for, people.) As souledout writes, it&#039;s an unfortunate example to use - but it&#039;s probably the right example to use.<br /><br />Sigh, new reply posted, ok: <br />When you compare sex offenders to rabid dogs, you absolve them of much of the responsibility for their acts.<br />With very, very few exceptions, people own their behaviors and choices. (Er, rabies would be one of those exceptions.)<br />Starting to kill people for secondary crimes, or crimes which promote other crimes, is certainly an interesting path down which we could start. <br />I&#039;ll leave it at: I think that justice in the case of rape, whether it&#039;s pediatric or adult, is necessary,&nbsp; but I don&#039;t regard perping pedophiles as &#039;rabid dogs&#039; any more than I&#039;ll regard any other sex offender as being &#039;out of control.&#039; &quot;I was all overcome and I just couldn&#039;t help myself.&quot; Yeah, the fuck you couldn&#039;t, pal. (There&#039;s an astronomically rare legitimate NGRI defense for a sexual assault but it&#039;s, like, every fifth blue moon.)<br />Doing something evil does not dehumanize anyone - quite the opposite. It is just part of the spectrum of human, which absolutely includes acts of evil. Humans have the capacity for evil. Dogs are just dogs.<br />Complicated little animals, humans.<br />

Most humans naturally seek to act out their fantasies (sexual/non-sexual/whatever) because it can give you all sorts of good feelings. It&#039;s a natural starting point. If you look at something that you find titillating in any way but particularly sexually long enough you are going to get the urge to experience the reality. That&#039;s why as soon as you make that first step, you are done in my eyes. The transition has been made and you are one of them. You may see things differently but it&#039;s just something I don&#039;t budge on and don&#039;t entertain a liberal attitude on. Would be boring if everyone was the same. I also know it wouldn&#039;t phase me to do it either, it&#039;s just one of those few things that makes me clear any human emotion for someone.

				Er. Last few times I read, and by that I do mean the last few dozen times I read, viewing pornography was not associated with an increase in sexual crimes (not counting the possession of pornography.)<br />Opposite, actually, in some rather well-done studies (CZ, JP, SE).<br /><br />It may certainly change the way people view their sexual partners, it may change a lot of things about social interaction, these are all big discussions, but the use of pornography is not associated with contact offenses.<br /><br />You need cites? Tell me you need citations. Really. I will be happy to post or PM, although I&#039;m off here in about 10 minutes so it&#039;ll have to be now or about 12 hours.<br /><br />Lest there be any urge for ad hominem attack here: I am very strongly opposed (this is an understatement) to the sexual assault of anyone. This is kind of a funny understatement for anyone who knows me.<br />I am also very opposed to the prosecution of people who aren&#039;t actually engaged in the direct harm of others, whether they&#039;re using drugs or looking at pictures or engaged in consensual kink or writing banned books.<br />I am also real keen on the First Amendment. <br />I have some esoteric interest in human sexual behavior, for assorted reasons beyond the usual.

				Hmm.<br />Not trying to change your mind about your personal revulsion to sexual crimes; that&#039;s your reaction, and it needs no justification whatsoever. Can agree to disagree on that one - well, actually, we are in agreement on the basic aversion! although we might disagree on how to respond.<br /><br />I am addressing your *belief* in&nbsp; how &quot;most humans&quot; respond to pornography in the longer-term, however, which is inaccurate, with a *description* of how large groups of humans have been observed to respond in the longer-term.&nbsp; I&#039;m addressing that because, down the road, it may impact your thinking on the issue - or it may not, that is up to you; however, you seem to have the same common belief that many people do. You can&#039;t make rational decisions on this topic if you&#039;re operating on crap data. (I am not one to operate on faith or belief or &quot;everyone knows.&quot;)&nbsp; It&#039;s hard enough already, because it is an emotionally laden topic that is overwhelming, and so the more objective data the better, I think.<br /><br />It&#039;s like saying that all people who use cathinones will become face-eaters or goatrapers, and therefore all the substituted cathinone users on here should be taken into re-education facilities and fitted with dental appliances and chastity belts. Basic assumption is flawed, but it is certainly widespread in the past few weeks.<br /><br />That&#039;s all.

Children are by and large defenseless and you have then shaped their whole life for the worst. For me that is just an unforgivable act and IMO those that benefit from it (consumers of CP) are just as to blame because I see it as one feeding of the other. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t really see killing someone like that in the same way normal murder. When you do something that predatory and that traumatic someone I think it dehumanises you and all you have left is an uncontrollable animal that acts on it&#039;s base urges. What would you do with a rabid dog? Shoot it in the head. Same principle. Takes care of the problem permanently.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You incorrectly see it as one feeding off of the other. You think viewing CP turns people into predatory rabid animals? Shit, we should put all of /b/ down.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think it&#039;s far from incorrect. Most humans naturally seek to act out their fantasies (sexual/non-sexual/whatever) because it can give you all sorts of good feelings. It&#039;s a natural starting point. If you look at something that you find titillating in any way but particularly sexually long enough you are going to get the urge to experience the reality. That&#039;s why as soon as you make that first step, you are done in my eyes. The transition has been made and you are one of them. You may see things differently but it&#039;s just something I don&#039;t budge on and don&#039;t entertain a liberal attitude on. Would be boring if everyone was the same. I also know it wouldn&#039;t phase me to do it either, it&#039;s just one of those few things that makes me clear any human emotion for someone.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So do you think that someone who is horribly deformed from an accident, or maybe genetic defect, should be banned from looking at adult pornography, since they have a remote chance of having consensual sex (with anyone other than a hooker I guess)? Will looking at adult pornography then lead them to rape?

This however retains in males even through their upper teenhood (not the same classmates, the ones that are thirteen NOW, dumbass.) Males even at the age of 20 are still attracted to 13 year olds, but at the age of 20, they instead settle for a fat 15 year old (if they are not in college) or a decent 20 year old (if they are in college). When a male turns 30, he goes through a stage of &quot;commitment&quot; in which he finds a decent girl (usually 25, just when they are dropping out of college) to get married to and live with. Even through their 30s, men are still attracted to 13 year old girls. As a man reaches 40, he becomes unattracted to his ugly smoker had a baby wife and starts going on the internet to talk to younger girls on Facebook or yahoo chat-rooms. At the age of 40 is when men start hitting on the babysitter, or their niece or whatever, which usually results in marital problems. When a man turns 50, his wife is completely done with sex and therefore the man must resort to actually pursuing his dreams of pedophilia. What now goes through his head is &quot;if im gonna cheat on my wife, it might as well be with a 13 yr old&quot; Because men are just like that. This is when they begin their &quot;plan&quot; to finally realize their hidden fantasy. Between then and the time they actually go to it can take up to 30 years, or 3 days if they&#039;re really dumb. Then, as they finally meet the young girl they hope to get freaky deaky with, Gary Oak comes out of their bedroom zipping up his pants, followed by Chris Hansen who owns you before the police put the permanent banhammer on your ass. Your life is over, good job. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If that&#039;s the basis behind most cases, that&#039;s disgusting!

The inability for people to distinguish between pedophilia and child molestation is as strange as it is common, I blame propaganda and media sensationalism for this phenomenon. People sometimes talk about child porn consumption directly causing some mystical voodoo process known as &quot;revictimization&quot; but there is absolutely no basis for this, it is essentially the same as asking me to believe that stabbing pins in a voodoo doll caricature of me will cause me to feel pain. Some people argue that access to child pornography increases a pedophiles risk of offending, but just as many studies say that it decreases the risk. Who knows what to believe in this world full of intense information warfare. So fall back to a morality stance, and increased probability of a pedophile molesting a child is not reason enough in my eyes to criminalize the behavior, that is pre-crime and pre-crime is bullshit. Some people argue that the commercial market or certain distribution structures result in the demand for child pornography causing production, but commercial child pornography is essentially non-existent in recent times, and at best this is an argument against certain distribution structures. I remain entirely unconvinced that viewing child porn is a particularly bad thing, although I am personally not turned on by children so avoid it :).

				I start a thread about how the FBI can&#039;t do anything about a crime committed on darknet and you bastards make it an argument about pedophile rights or some bullshit...<br /><br />look you sick degenerates... just because you can rationalize your sickness doesn&#039;t make it right... many monsters throughout history have rationalized their horrific deeds.<br /><br />Here is a good litmus test for whether or not you are a degenerate... if 99.9% of the human population DOES NOT agree with your right to fuck with children then YOU are a degenerate fuck who needs to put a bullet in his own head and save himself the embarrassment of a public trial, not to mention what that trial will do to your own children and family... <br /><br />defending pedophiles should be left up to the attorneys trying to keep their idiotic clients from long prison terms... <br /><br />EVERY picture EVER taken of a child in a sexual way to fill some perverted sexual desire is a picture of abuse... PERIOD. There is NO rationalizing that. Just because you didn&#039;t take the picture doesn&#039;t mean you are not responsible and arguing that there is no correlation between production and use is like trying to say that &#039;SUPPLY and DEMAND&#039; is a economic MYTH.<br /><br />pedophiles create pedophiles... and it can only be stopped by eradicating the sickness before it has a chance to corrupt another child.. so if we can catch you now while you are still looking at someone elses kid before you have a chance to reproduce and abuse your own kids then I am all for locking you up for looking at that filth.

				It&#039;s important to remember the difference between thinking and acting. A pedophile and a child molester are not the same thing. A pedophile is a person who has an unfortunate, but uncontrollable sexual desire for children. No different than whatever weird kinks you may have. A child molester is a person who molests children. Thought =/= action<br /><br />You may think their fetish is sick, and it might be, but you need to recognize it for what it is: a fetish. They can&#039;t help it. Can you just turn off your attraction to a great pair of tits? It&#039;s the same thing.<br /><br />If someone rapes a 4 year old and you want to hold him down and castrate him you won&#039;t hear any protest from me. But to call for the death of all people who have ever had a deviant thought about a child is a thought crime. Nobody, especially in a place like Silk Road, should advocate the punishment of thought crimes. <br /><br />

				I never thought I would see anybody on Silkroad of all places use the &quot;It&#039;s wrong because it&#039;s illegal!&quot; argument.&nbsp; Let alone a vendor. <br /><br />Nobody is arguing that touching a kid in their naughty place is okay, it&#039;s obviously not and you can throw anybody who does to the wolves for all I care. But you can&#039;t punish people for their goddamn thoughts and the fact that I have to raise this point in a place that I see as a beacon for civil liberty and rational thought is really a shame.<br /><br /><br />But whatever, point is the priority should really be stopping actual child molesters and the monsters who create kiddie porn, not the guy who is looking at it. The mass hysteria about pedophiles is really quite ridiculous, load of media fear-mongering no different than what they do with drugs. Kids can&#039;t even play outside anymore because everyone is a goddamn pedophile, it&#039;s a witch hunt.

				Same here, I don&#039;t think many people on SR are Pro-CP. I just think it&#039;s important that everyone who is not causing harm to others be treated equally, even if what they think or say repulses you.
