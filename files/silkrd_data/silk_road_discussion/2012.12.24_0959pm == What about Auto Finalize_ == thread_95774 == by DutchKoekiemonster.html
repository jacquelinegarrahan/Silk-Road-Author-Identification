				Hey Folks,<br /><br />Sorry for this cause this may be a stuphit question but I haven&#039;t been able to figure it out yet.. Can&#039;t find anything about it on the forum....<br /><br />Me being a seller now for a while and I have a buyer who&#039;ve let his purchase went into Auto Finalize..<br /><br />What does this mean for me as a vendor? Should I be happy with this cause the money went out of escrow and it&#039;s mine now? In case his order did not arrive, I can&#039;t give him any refund or resend cause he did not went into resolution, right? Can he / is he able to give me any feedback at all after he left his order go into Auto Finalize?<br /><br />I&#039;m not that confident, but thanks a lot in case someone can explain this to me..<br /><br />,,

				He can go back and leave you feedback. The money is all yours now and you now have no responsibility to the buyer...however, if his package did go missing and he can prove it, a good vendor would work with him to get everything sorted out.

				Yes, but in case the seller claims that nothing has arrived yet how can he prove? Nowhere on my buyers account I can find what and when he bought even not who the seller was.. And a refund through SR is not even possible anymore at this point, is it? Should I just believe this buyer on his word and give him a resend of what he said he ordered after he send me his address again?<br /><br />Thanks a lot for being so kind answering me man :)

				If the buyer can e-mail a photo or copy of the package being confiscated, then as a seller I&#039;d either resend the order to the buyer or refund 50% to him.<br /><br />You can still give him a refund outside of escrow. In your account page of the seller account you can send BTC directly to the user by specifying his username and the amount.<br /><br />In my opinion, only refund if the buyer can prove in some way that the package was actually taken/lost somehow..<br /><br />Hope this helps a bit !<br />Cheers, and happy new year!<br /><br />/L-Y

				Hello DutchKoekiemonster,<br /><br />First of all, as a vendor you should have a refund policy on your profile page which clearly states in which circumstances a refund is to be given, and how much the refund will amount to. This is something only you can decide upon. For example, you might decide to give a 100% refund in cases where the buyer can prove the package was confiscated or that it did not arrive (eg through a tracking number or customs letter), but only a 50% refund where no proof is available. Or you might decide that where no proof is available, no refund is to be given but that you will reship. As I said, only you can decide what your policy is and what you feel comfortable with. Make sure that the policy is clearly stated on your profile page, because this is part of the &quot;contract&quot; between you and the buyer.<br /><br />And as the poster above me said, you can still give a refund outside of escrow - just send the BTC directly to his account.<br /><br />In my opinion, in this particular case and if I was a vendor myself, I would not give a refund because the buyer did not go into resolution and instead let the transaction auto-finalize. Unless of course the buyer can prove that he is very new to SR and was unaware that in cases of non-arrival you should go to resolution rather than let it auto-finalize. <br /><br />Do as you feel the more honest thing to do is.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />HOUSE

				It all comes down to what you believe. If you believe the buyer did receive the package as was just trying to scam you then don&#039;t do anything. If you believe the buyer really did not receive the package then act accordingly. Personally I would refund or reship, whichever the buyer preferred. I see it as my job to get the package to the mailbox the buyer requests and take full responsibility if that does not happen. I track all shipments and haven&#039;t lost a package yet.<br /><br />You get to be the judge since the buyer didn&#039;t participate in the resolution process. Do what you think is right.

				If he hasn&#039;t gotten in touch with you maybe life happened to him. Sick/hurt and in the hospital, computer lost or stolen, etc.. Or perhaps the package was received days back and they just never logged in to Finalize.<br /><br />You have not done anything wrong.

				Thank you guys for even answering this question. I just want to keep my reputation at least above 95% and I&#039;m really trying everything to retain this.. I find out it&#039;s not that easy: some people have no respect and they think this is easy money for us vendors, while, if you want to do this right and honest, it&#039;s lots of work and almost a 24/7 job.. I preferred going to college and get a proper job..<br /><br />I&#039;ve read some vendors about they keeping a scammer lists were addresses of scammers could be checked, how can I get access to something like this? This may be a foolish question too, but I&#039;ve once heard stupid questions don&#039;t exist (^_-), so I would be very pleased if someone can explain to me how this works. I mean, we vendors should have got the opportunity to blacklist scammers or possible scammers right? I am a great buyer at SR myself too and I would never scam anyone:&nbsp; I have moral values..<br /><br />Thanks a lot :)<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m confused as to why all vendors aren&#039;t allowed to see the blacklist, just seems like poor form to me, selectively allowing new vendors to get scammed

It will be at the top of the stack too.<br /><br />The Vendor&#039;s Roundtable is a section of the forum you need to get approval to access. The requirements are around here somewhere. I recall them to be: 35 transactions, link to your vendor page in your forum signature, and a review of your SR account by support.

				Id say at this point it is his fault for letting it auto finalize. If he cant prove that he got it, then he may be trying to scam you, at this point keep the money. let it be a lesson to him to not let it auto finalize. He should of brought it to the resolution center<br /><br />If he is a buyrer with good stats, and a low refund rate,&nbsp; and you actually believe him, then you should refund him 50% or resend it. It is really up to you at this point.<br /><br />and yes he can go back and leave feedback at any point in the future. you can always edit your feedback
