				We are a new vendor account with only about 45 transactions. Every single buyer has had nothing but enthusiastic 5/5 reviews, some even sending us PMâ€™s to compliment us on great product and service. Then last night we have two orders finalize. One of those orders leaves a 5/5 review on our vendor page, and the other leaves no review, but suddenly our vendor average rating plummets to 3.7 out of 5. Can this be right? Can it be that this one buyer randomly left a 3/5 when finalizing and it caused our average rating to drop that much? Now everywhere that our vendor name displays, it has an ugly 3.7 next to it, which is obviously not good for business, but also hardly seems like an accurate reflection of our performance to date. What&#039;s going on here?

				A buyer who has spent a lot of money here has given you a 3/5, which because his reviews are so heavily weighted compared to other buyers has dropped your stats.<br /><br />Your best bet is to contact him and seek a resolution, he can&#039;t change his rating to a 5/5, but he can remove it.

But the feedback system can&#039;t please all the people all the time either, now can it? So contacting the buyer seems like the way to go, but can someone explain how to see numerical ratings from buyers who have not submitted a review? Many thanks. And +1 to you, John the Baptist.

				When the rating systems changed I went from 99.1% to 4.9/5. Since then I have had nothing but 5/5&#039;s, yet I have dropped to 4.8/5.<br /><br />This new math is so fucked up I wonder if they are even using numbers.

				yeah i agree the new rating system sucks, i do like that discuss feature on the vendors page but the way the feedback works and the system weighs each transaction is stupid, and most buyers are just giving 5&#039;s anyway so they dont get blasted by the vendor or blacklisted by them so the feedback rating is pointless and i would say over 60% of the ratings the vendors have are true to what is going on cause like i said it seems tho people dont care give them a product you get a 5 , so unreliable when trying to do research,&nbsp; i much rather just talk to the customers on the forums and in the discussion tabs about the vendors, but with all these scam accounts coming up on both sides vendors and buyers i dont even know if i can trust anything anyone says anymore cause its hard to tell you who has padded accounts and who doesnt

				It used to be that vendors didn&#039;t want to deal with buyers who had low buyer stats, but I wonder if the trend now will be to discourage buyers who have HIGH buyer stats, knowing that if just one of those buyers leaves a bad feedback it will fuck the vendor&#039;s average rating. That would be a curious turn of events.

				I just cannot comprehend how getting ONLY 5/5s can result in me going from 4.9 to 4.8. Math does not work that way.

				i had the exact same problem, 100% then 5/5 with the first change , then i so called customer went almost 2 months back and changed to 1/5 dropped my stats to 4.9. i noticed i had 6 of my last 8 orders all huge over $5000 , no feedback left, all from same customer, they state that they can not leave feedback? this is what is messing all of us up. customers are either unable or just do not leave feedback.Most customers once the deal is done don&#039;t want their name or any way of tieing the deal to them, they dont care because they got what they needed, their order.

				In the last 20 days 100% of my feedbacks have been 5/5.<br /><br />In the last 20 days my feedback has gone from 4.9 to 4.8 to 4.7.<br /><br />I cannot comprehend the mathematics behind 100% 5/5s resulting in a feedback score dropping. I cannot help but wonder what I have to do to keep a good feedback score other than keeping 100% of my customers happy.<br /><br />I asked vendor support about this and their response was nothing but a series of links to forum posts. I read every last one of them. Not one explains why getting 100% 5/5 feedback would result in a reduction in my score. I feel like I am being misrepresented and that my complaints are being ignored by the Silk Road staff.<br /><br />The feedback system is broken. No rational person can accept a system where one&#039;s feedback score drops when 100% of the feedback has been 5/5. This is bad math plain and simple. I have happy customers and I do not deserve this.<br />

I sure hope we don&#039;t have to keep &quot;getting used to&quot; this broken system. I also hope my +1 here does not make your 4.7 drop lower ;-) Who knows where they are getting the numbers from.
