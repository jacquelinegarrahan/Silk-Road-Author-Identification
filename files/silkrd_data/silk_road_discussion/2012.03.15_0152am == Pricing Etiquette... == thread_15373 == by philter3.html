				I am putting this question in the Main discussion section since I&#039;ve not yet upgraded to a vendor account.<br /><br />&nbsp;Question is this.. is there a community etiquette standard towards pricing?&nbsp; Here&#039;s where I&#039;m coming from..<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m not considering vending anything I didn&#039;t grow. I&#039;m a fungi guy. It costs me almost nothing to do what I&#039;m going to do (I was doing it anyway.. I just upped production by... ahem.. well a good bit). I&#039;m a paranoid guy. I look at S.R. and the mere thought of even possibly getting some $$ for my crops with almost no LE risk makes me salivate.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time.. I don&#039;t want to be *that* asshole. Is there a community etiquette standard.. like say don&#039;t undercut the average price on a product by more than 25% or something to keep everybody vending getting a taste?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Some guidance from the senior members of the community would be appreciated.&nbsp; It&#039;s not good to undermine the long term health of a laudable project like this by playing hard-ball economics and dominating a niche product by dropping the price to the floor and beating it with a ballpen hammer right? Or is that just how the community wants it and is aiming for?

				Hell no man, this isn&#039;t The Informant, we aren&#039;t all involved in a price fixing scheme...&nbsp; Come in and undercut all the vendors by 50%, I bet you don&#039;t get one complaint.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite the contrary actually as vendors need not worry about other vendors pricing unless they are buying from that vendor.<br /><br />If you can grow any product and blow all the other sellers out of the water, feel free to do it.&nbsp; SR is a free market, you are your own ceo.&nbsp; If vendors get mad you have better prices, they need to step their game up and get the fuck over it quickly.<br /><br />

				hell yeah this is a free market PLUS most of the weed (i assume it&#039;s weed you&#039;re growing / i can&#039;t say much about other drug&#039;s prices) on SR is waaaaaaaay too expensive. yes i know there has to be some effort put into the whole thing as a vendor but c&#039;mon 20+ dollars for ONE!!!!(1) gram of weed? wtf is this? i live in a area where weed is extremely expensive compared to the rest of europe but even around here people would spit in your face for demanding 20+ bucks...

				Doesn&#039;t matter how completely absurd you price your items ($30 for a gram of weed) some retard is still going to fucking buy it. This really annoys me, if we didn&#039;t buy drugs at ridiculous prices vendors would be forced to lower them. Seems like I&#039;m the only one that grasps this concept.

				My two cents: when I see a new vendor undercut everyone by 50% my first thought is scam vendor or shoddy/questionable product. Why not undercut them by a few dollars, you&#039;ll still get the business.<br /><br />As for a tale of two drugs, the price of weed is high in here compared to the real world, while I&#039;ve seen the price of shrooms go from an average of $240 an oz last summer to about $140 now. Lots of growers but not enough buyers to sop up all the supply. Major glut in shrooms now. Would be nice to see prices fall like that in the weed dept.

Course it&#039;s kinda hard to imagine paying $140 either given the seeming advantages of this place.. My assumption was that given the escrow system exists.. (i.e. I *KNOW* dude had the money.. and had to part with it) and given that we never meet (good luck siccing Johny Law on me) the prices should drop quite a bit further past that $140 point. This is for a growing seller.. the math is *totally* different if I had to pay my own dope man.

				Welcome philter3, <br /><br />Glad to have another vendor for &quot;fungi&quot; here. <br /><br />What you should do so as to justify whatever price you charge is to give out some samples of your product to some established and trusted members on the site who will in turn review your product. Some may even do a comparative to the quality of the product other shroom vendors sell.<br /><br />Many vendors have started out by giving away samples to be reviewed. You may find that because of the quality of your product, rather than undercutting the competition, you can sell at a small premium relative to the others. <br /><br />Seriously consider giving out samples as a form of advertizing. In the end, you may find buyers beating a path to your proverbial door to buy what you have.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				lol just undercut it, sucks for some items because supply is difficult but lol at 20/g for weed. the prices have come up significantly from ~6mnths ago on many items, lsd used to be around 8usd for 100um even when buying only 5 or so. no it&#039;s up to 12+ for many vendors. i&#039;m assuming the more reputable guys just go higher cos they can, and the rest follow. it&#039;s not like many people have access to lots of lsd anyway so it works for them

Add in a few scam buyers and all of a sudden $140 an oz becomes $100 real quick.<br /><br />Before you go nuts with some crazy sale, keep in mind that the price you put for your product is not the price you get in the end.

Add it up and that&#039;s what you charge. If it&#039;s lower than other sellers charge that, If it&#039;s more you might want to rethink if you want to do this.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Most of you guys dont count your labor costs??&nbsp; if shrooms were easy to grow everyone would be doing it and its not like the pros dont factor in 10-20% loss to contams and everything else that goes wrong.<br /><br />But if your labor is free then your costs will be low.<br />if you are slightly serious about selling shrooms of some quantity on SR you will have a&nbsp; substantial outlay. Laminar, commercial ish size sterilizers, jars and consumables. <br />Do you guys factor this shit in when you set your low low prices? Electricity?<br />If your shrooms are well under the going rate which I feel is pretty good last time I checked on SR than I will have a guess and say they are wild shrooms.<br /><br /><br />$20 by the gram for cannabis? lol do you guys know what a kilowatt costs these days? even setting up a little op will set you back $5000. Have you guys ever tried growing hydro? enough to get a little market share? once again it is fucking labor intensive unless you are a veteran grower... apparently.<br /><br />Thats without even costing out the risk involved.<br /><br />There is no etiquette involved. But those who come in under market value prices never stay long.. and if they do their price goes up after some thought.<br />

It cuts down on a lot of that. Just cook up the grain and sterilize your jars once the grain dries up and you&#039;re golden. Pasteurizing bulk sub can be done in a 5 gal bucket and an hour or two of letting it sit by itself. No need to touch it once the boiling water is poured in. As far as humidity and temp for me it&#039;s just set and forget, but that could be different with a different set up. I also live in the country so good or bad horse shit is everywhere and farmers give it away for free lol. Anyway, you obviously are set up and know what you&#039;re talking about I&#039;ve just had an easier experience with my fruits. I&#039;d imagine weed to be exponentially harder. YMMV.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t to derail the thread. Back on point welcome philter. The main point is to price your shrooms where you are happy to do the work because the fact is it is at the very least some work to grow these beautiful things. If you&#039;re happy with the price and being fair to yourself I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll sell all of your stock. Good luck and welcome to the community.

Unlike me.. who couldn&#039;t make the right way work correctly, so went back to the newbie basic route and scaled up to bulk subs along a different path without the rye and agar and horse shit and so forth. See.. I had a laminar when few others did (I used to be into expensive toys for my hobby). So I got into LCs early on.. and they are SOOOO much nicer than plates and agar. <br /><br />&nbsp;Much respect to you for paying your dues in the horse shit man. You are a better dude than I.

				yeah grain to grain, but there is limits as you know. Ever tried cooking 20kg+ of grain and sterilizing it. Thats a days work amongst other things. Im not talking the throwing a couple of jars of WBS in a sterilizer. This is about growing enough to keep up demand on SR and IRL?<br /><br />5 gal is not bulk imo. Setting up a 44gal or 2 is bulk. <br />Also set and forget does not work in bulk grows. Its ok if your in the right temperate, but if you are in a zone where it is 35C in the shade and 110% humidity it is very difficult to cool and achieve the right humidity.<br /><br />Anyway I am not trying to get in a my dick is bigger than your dick contest, nor do I feel this is a derailment. My point is to achieve a kg of dried shrooms is a fucking lot of work and one should think about this when setting your price. ;)<br />Peace

Unlike me.. who couldn&#039;t make the right way work correctly, so went back to the newbie basic route and scaled up to bulk subs along a different path without the rye and agar and horse shit and so forth.

I had less success with LC. Even tho it is easier and quicker it was not as productive for me anyway. Cutting a few chunks of agar and whacking them in a jar colonizes a little slower but not by much imo.<br />But if you get LC just right then you are laughing.

				Your approach is sound. You&#039;re a new vendor who I&#039;m sure will have glowing product reviews from the samples you&#039;ll be sending out. Once you go live, be sure to link the review thread (of the samples) on your sale page. You&#039;d also be wise to sell it cheaper than the competition. At least for the first round until you get some feedback ratings. Then raise your prices a bit to sell what the market is will to bear. <br /><br />I could see you selling at pricing parity to the competition in no time. You&#039;re highly knowledgeable, personable, give off a vibe of trustworthiness and&nbsp; you seem as if you&#039;d be very accommodating of the buyers needs. possessing All the attributes of a great vendor. <br /><br />Wishing you the best...<br /><br />BenJesuit

You will find most shroom vendors dont have to pay their suppliers. <br />Your motivations are clear now and you want to stick it to those who recognize the market value and what it is worth to grow and vend. You will get a little slice but you will do nothing to the overall shroom market because you will sell all your crop cheap and will not have enough for the demand and so the market goes back to normal. But at least you will be popular.<br /><br />I will be interested to see if you keep up your prices once you realize what vending entails. <br /><br />Imo if you are going to give away your work you may as well give it all away to mates.<br /><br />Please dont take my comments as being negative. I am all for experiments and you will definitely see the power of SR. So much so, you will be very popular with those prices. Popularity means more work. More exposure. You will then start to see why the prices are what they are unless your currency is to be popular.<br /><br />Good Luck on your experiment. I will be following you;)

I&#039;m a fungi guy. It costs me almost nothing to do what I&#039;m going to do (I was doing it anyway.. I just upped production by... ahem.. well a good bit). I&#039;m a paranoid guy. I look at S.R. and the mere thought of even possibly getting some $$ for my crops with almost no LE risk makes me salivate.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time.. I don&#039;t want to be *that* asshole. Is there a community etiquette standard.. like say don&#039;t undercut the average price on a product by more than 25% or something to keep everybody vending getting a taste?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Some guidance from the senior members of the community would be appreciated.&nbsp; It&#039;s not good to undermine the long term health of a laudable project like this by playing hard-ball economics and dominating a niche product by dropping the price to the floor and beating it with a ballpen hammer right? Or is that just how the community wants it and is aiming for?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What you&#039;re referring to is &quot;price fixing,&quot; and it&#039;s illegal in legal markets. All illegal drug dealers participate in price fixing to a certain degree, and the ones that make the most money are the most careful.<br /><br />You would be harming the market if you set a standard price, or tried to set one. First, even if every seller would agree to it, how would you enforce it? Even in markets where there are laws governing businesses and contracts, there is no way to be sure that another seller would honor their agreement. <br /><br />It would harm the market if you agreed to a higher price than current market, and it would harm the market if you agreed to a lower price than market. A price floor, or a price lower than market, prices certain sellers out of the market that can&#039;t afford to sell at that price. Quality of the product would also suffer with a price floor. A price ceiling not only gouges the buyer (like gas prices) but allows someone brand new to come in and price their stuff so cheap (even if they lose profit for a little while) that other sellers can&#039;t compete, losing so much business that the drop out.<br /><br />The best way to ensure that the SR market isn&#039;t fucked up any more than it already is, is to set a price by determining what margin you need to continue to be profitable so your business (and you) can survive/pay expenses, and always set your price to that margin. Make sure you take into account risk, and any money lost due to returns, lost merchandise, or even unscrupulous buyers, because those cause prices to go up and should factor into all of it.

Frankly the thought of not ever being in a position where I have to decide whether to draw on someone at a business meet, and the idea that I&#039;m basically immune to legal threat if I&#039;m cautious is enough to put up with some MAJOR downsides.<br /><br />&nbsp;Frankly I&#039;m hoping Novacaine is right and the hungry hordes of S.R. are going to work my ass off. It would be awesome and amazing to have 20+ hours of paying shroom work a week.

This is for a growing seller.. the math is *totally* different if I had to pay my own dope man.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sure $140 an oz isn&#039;t that bad for a grower, but this ain&#039;t street dealing, where you get handed $140 in cash tax free and walk away. You gotta pay the Pirate his 9% commission, then you pay the 4% escrow fee, then you gotta figure out how to get those bitcoins into cash, which isn&#039;t free by a longshot, and we haven&#039;t even gotten into the wild swings in the bitcoin price while your orders sit in escrow for 17 days. Add in a few scam buyers and all of a sudden $140 an oz becomes $100 real quick.<br /><br />Before you go nuts with some crazy sale, keep in mind that the price you put for your product is not the price you get in the end. Listen to the advice in here, you&#039;re better off giving out some samples, creating a presence on the forums and doing right by the orders you get. Stick with that and you&#039;ll grow your business just fine. Cowboys never last in here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&lt;This<br /><br />People just don&#039;t understand the massive overhead that it takes to sell on SR. One you have to be able to let your money float for at least a week which is a LONG fucking time when you are drug dealer. I have dropped dealers who take more than a week to bring back my fronts. Then you are to go through the process of converting BTC to USD which cuts out some money and can take time. Then you have to deal with getting the money without having it recorded which could mean getting the money mailed to you. <br /><br />However, for many people in places like the mid west weed and especially other drugs are not easy to find so you would gladly pay way over California street price. Now if you live in fucking California or Florida than don&#039;t bitch that the prices on SR for weed are higher than street prices. Guess what, not everyone in the US lives in an area with a large supply of drugs. Same goes for Oxys, Bars, etc. Most drugs are completely dependent on location.<br /><br />SR is also great for things like heavy psychedelics which might not have that large of a market in your local area. God knows its hard to sell exotic RCs like 2c-b, AMT, Foxy, etc locally but on SR you have a much wider market so you can have larger economies of scale.<br /><br />Cmon guys, this is common sense. If you want dirt cheap weed SR simply isn&#039;t the place. <br /><br />I think the biggest cost to SR is the fact that your money is tied up on SR. If I didn&#039;t keep at least 6k in Capital than I wouldn&#039;t be able to provide bulk orders with razor thin margins direct from China.

				If you undercut too much you&#039;ll simply sell out fast. Once people know you have good product and aren&#039;t a scammer you would sell anything you can produce with 5 gallon bucket and pf cakes in 3 days or less. The prices are high because the demand on SR is even higher.

I spent a good bit of time reading through S.R., reading the forum threads, the vendor profiles etc.&nbsp; Trying to get a feel for stuff. I have only two real negative observations.. <br />&nbsp; 1.) Prices are high. For the stuff I like anyway (read weed and psychedelics). I have no idea whether the prices for heroin/pills/etc. are high. <br />&nbsp; 2.) The top vendors all have to pay their supplier/s.<br /><br />&nbsp;I wonder if the two could possibly, possibly somehow be connected? <br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway I&#039;m going to do an experiment. I been mucking about with growing personal for over a decade. Never got into distro cause I got alot to lose by getting popped on some street action.&nbsp; I&#039;ve probably been out somewhere between 3-8K US$ on my hobby over the years. I figure.. I should give this place a chance to show me personally it&#039;s power. I in turn will show mine. I commit that everything in my present crop of Amazonia will hit the listings at 75% OR LESS of SR average. I&#039;m going to shoot for a price of&nbsp; 20.00 BTC per solid ounce. I have had people tell me via PM that such a price would scream &quot;scam&quot; to people. But the simple truth is.. how can I charge for what I spent on *myself* YEARS ago? When people like Pharmville and DRamsterdam and such are doing huge volumes and trying to make money on a *spread*?<br /><br />&nbsp;Seems pretty shitty to me.. to say &quot;hey dudes.. I grow.. but even though I got the same legal risk as selling them to a sound long time known bro from the neighborhood..and even though I got maybe a buck an oz. in this.. you are going to have to pay for it like I&#039;m trying hard to make 30% off my investment with my dope man!&quot;. That doesn&#039;t scan. Not to me. <br />&nbsp; Harvest happens next month. When it does I&#039;ll send out samples to some folks (a few who contacted me, high count posters in my question threads, any of the mods who want a taste). Then I&#039;ll sell a whole crop here and see how people respond.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If spirits are high and it&#039;s all love.. then I&#039;ll keep my production up, keep the prices that low and feed the Fremen :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I dont feel your negatives are connected. You will find most shroom vendors dont have to pay their suppliers. <br />Your motivations are clear now and you want to stick it to those who recognize the market value and what it is worth to grow and vend. You will get a little slice but you will do nothing to the overall shroom market because you will sell all your crop cheap and will not have enough for the demand and so the market goes back to normal. But at least you will be popular.<br /><br />I will be interested to see if you keep up your prices once you realize what vending entails. <br /><br />Imo if you are going to give away your work you may as well give it all away to mates.<br /><br />Please dont take my comments as being negative. I am all for experiments and you will definitely see the power of SR. So much so, you will be very popular with those prices. Popularity means more work. More exposure. You will then start to see why the prices are what they are unless your currency is to be popular.<br /><br />Good Luck on your experiment. I will be following you;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, you got a lot to learn. <br /><br />Nobody that sells illegal drugs, even weed, is doing it out of &quot;love.&quot; THey may be cool, loving people, but they are trying to make money. Plain and simple. <br /><br />If you think the prices too high on Silk Road, that&#039;s fine, try to compete with the sellers and see what happens. You may be right, and if so, you will succeed and still be here. But I think you&#039;ll find that the costs associated with selling are more than you think, and the risk associated with all of this stuff is what you aren&#039;t considering.

Here&#039;s hoping you and novacaine are 100% correct. That way I can move all I can grow super-quick and bank my revenue, then the other growers can do their thing in their way once I&#039;m all sold out. That would be sing-along time for everyone concerned eh?<br /><br />&nbsp;I am hoping to list in mid April. There is alot to do. There are a couple of vendors (DmitriSpice and Team Synaptic) who have awesome(!!!) .onions to supplement their listings. And the custom vanity onion Silk Road has.. very very classy.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; I had to find a template with no Java or anything but straight HTML/XHTML/CSS to mod out, and I will have to anonymize/strip metadata on alot of pics but once I&#039;m done they will be on a vanity .onion . Shallot is a neat chunk of code. Wish I could write stuff like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;Lots and lots to do. Joy joy joy :D

That&#039;s like &quot;smoking shroom powder&quot;. You can do the same with pure psilocin (4-HO-DMT) freebase. The trip comes on in seconds and lasts only half the time.

The real money in this game is simply the sales (listing your items) and service (packaging &amp; safely mailing), not the traditional sourcing/manufacturing aspect. The premiums paid for product here mean that it&#039;s more like you get paid $50 to $300 per hour to be a glorified mail clerk and postal IT tech support worker.

This is for a growing seller.. the math is *totally* different if I had to pay my own dope man.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sure $140 an oz isn&#039;t that bad for a grower, but this ain&#039;t street dealing, where you get handed $140 in cash tax free and walk away. You gotta pay the Pirate his 9% commission, then you pay the 4% escrow fee, then you gotta figure out how to get those bitcoins into cash, which isn&#039;t free by a longshot, and we haven&#039;t even gotten into the wild swings in the bitcoin price while your orders sit in escrow for 17 days. Add in a few scam buyers and all of a sudden $140 an oz becomes $100 real quick.<br /><br />Before you go nuts with some crazy sale, keep in mind that the price you put for your product is not the price you get in the end. Listen to the advice in here, you&#039;re better off giving out some samples, creating a presence on the forums and doing right by the orders you get. Stick with that and you&#039;ll grow your business just fine. Cowboys never last in here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&lt;This<br /><br />People just don&#039;t understand the massive overhead that it takes to sell on SR. One you have to be able to let your money float for at least a week which is a LONG fucking time when you are drug dealer. I have dropped dealers who take more than a week to bring back my fronts. Then you are to go through the process of converting BTC to USD which cuts out some money and can take time. Then you have to deal with getting the money without having it recorded which could mean getting the money mailed to you. <br /><br />However, for many people in places like the mid west weed and especially other drugs are not easy to find so you would gladly pay way over California street price. Now if you live in fucking California or Florida than don&#039;t bitch that the prices on SR for weed are higher than street prices. Guess what, not everyone in the US lives in an area with a large supply of drugs. Same goes for Oxys, Bars, etc. Most drugs are completely dependent on location.<br /><br />SR is also great for things like heavy psychedelics which might not have that large of a market in your local area. God knows its hard to sell exotic RCs like 2c-b, AMT, Foxy, etc locally but on SR you have a much wider market so you can have larger economies of scale.<br /><br />Cmon guys, this is common sense. If you want dirt cheap weed SR simply isn&#039;t the place. <br /><br />I think the biggest cost to SR is the fact that your money is tied up on SR. If I didn&#039;t keep at least 6k in Capital than I wouldn&#039;t be able to provide bulk orders with razor thin margins direct from China.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I never have to front money.
