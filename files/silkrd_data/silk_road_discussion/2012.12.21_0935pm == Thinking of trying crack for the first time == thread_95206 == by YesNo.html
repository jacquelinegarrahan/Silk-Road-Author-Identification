				&nbsp;Course it is. It&#039;s fucking crack.<br /><br />But if you are gonna do it... Be sure that<br /><br />1. You have a strong constitution (for example I told myself I&#039;d take heroin no more than a few times, and I did, and then quit, regardless of the comedown)<br />2. Play by your own rules and never break them<br />3. Get good shit<br />4. Research dose<br /><br />That&#039;s pretty much it<br /><br />Rules no1+2 are everything though. <br /><br />It all depends on how you come to understand your own power of will. If you know yourself, then you know if you can take it.

				To be completely honest man, I&#039;d just go with meth... If you&#039;re looking for a strong stimulant, meth is the bees-knees. Much better than crack. Longer lasting too, and it legitimately has therapeutic benefits as opposed to crack which is just crack.

				No. Crack is the poor mans cocaine that was made by stretching the cocaine out as much as possible to make more product. Some dealers also put harmful chemicals in their crack, it is more addictive than cocaine, and it lasts less than 5 minutes. Go with methamphetamine, you&#039;ll be high for hours on end.

				Crack can give you a heart attack.<br />I think the percentage of first time users who die from this is significant.<br />Not worth it, though I have never tried it. I just know that coke gets me fucked if I have too much.<br /><br />coke can kill if you swallow like a gram at once. Crack goes into your system so fast and if you smoke allot at once it will peak at higher levels than coke can and could be dangerous.<br /><br />But then again Phil Mitchel seemed ok and he has a bad heart from all the drink.<br /><br />But then again , he is just a fictional character.

				If the foxy man knows anything... and I&#039;ve smoked a lot of coca puffs and crack... I&#039;d say most important thing when trying crack for the first time is to decide how much you are going to do before you start and stick to it. If you don&#039;t.. well then you&#039;re fucked. I always prefer some A1 coke over wack anyday. Just make sure you&#039;re strong willed!! If you&#039;re feeling blue after some crack, take a benzo to calm down-

				Personally, I have never tried crack, and I&nbsp; never will.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I consider trying a new drug, I always weigh risk vs. reward.&nbsp; With crack and other drugs like meth and heroin, I feel that the risk of addiction and dependency is much too great to ever justify trying them.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said, this is a personal decision.&nbsp; If you believe that trying crack could be a worthwhile experience for you, then give it a try.&nbsp; Just be sure to educate yourself on proper dosage/usage and be prepared to accept the consequences of your decision.<br /><br />Good luck!

				All rational thinking goes out the window when you try a highly addictive drug like this, espcially when you have an addictive personality and money in your pocket.&nbsp; Im not just talking out of my ass, Im speaking from personal experience.&nbsp; Straight out of high school I started college part time, had a full time job making 400 a week and delivered pizza part time for another couple hundred a week.&nbsp; I got my first apt, had a car and a nice sports motorcycle.&nbsp; I had it made.&nbsp; I was introduced to crack and I lost everything!&nbsp; I have been in and out of jail since then and I bet you I would be alot farther in life if I didnt fuck with that shit.

				*CLEARNET WARNING*<br /><br />http://www.tripsn.com/images/memo/bonedog/reefer/marijuana_not_even_once.jpg<br /><br />Seriously though man, this is why I don&#039;t really like the idea of asking these kind of things on here. Any decision you make will be influenced by the responses you get, instead of by what you want. For example, I was going to post a heroin yes/no, then I realised that I really do want to try the drug, so it goes without saying what will happen next.<br /><br />Also we are a somewhat biased crowd ^^

				My room-mate does crack. If you didnt know you woudnt know. But he is totally selfish and a total liar and totally unreliable.<br />But he always seems to land on his feet and hes a likeable popular bloke.<br />So i dont know what to advise really .

				My experience was of a less clean, less enjoyable high than doing high grade coke AS COKE. Kinda like the difference between doing pure, lab grade shatter meth and low grade crank. <br /><br />Less enjoyable high, less time up, less % of time spent at the top of your high, and more addictive. And actually ends up costing more $/hour buzzed overall.

Being the bad ass vendor I am, you know I can&#039;t resist to sell that bag or that hand full of pills on the streets too. But for real at one point I used to make some bomb ass crack. Me and the other guy selling it called it Super Crack and once we got you hooked we would start selling you some yellow ass shit the black man sold me. It was all about the money. Long story short I seen too many lives ruined by my own doing. How do I sleep at night you ask? I tell myself it was there choice but in all honesty after you were on the hook you no longer made that choice crack chose for you. <br /><br />My opinion. Don&#039;t ruin your life. Assholes like my old self will let you make the choice to fuck up your life. If you do choose to do it don&#039;t buy too much and get it off the road. If you can&#039;t get or don&#039;t know where else to get it your many days away from that all important next hit.
