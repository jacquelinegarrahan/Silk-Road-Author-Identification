				For the past year I have been setting up accounts and posting on the forum for samples on them accounts.<br />I have been collecting all your addresses and names using them to open forged account to empty moneypaks on.<br />The only reason I do this is because I run moneypak scams on this site and that&#039;s how I don&#039;t get caught.<br />I use your names to empty the cards. I have collected hundreds of names and addresses doing this.<br />That&#039;s right. When you&#039;re calling moneypak because you were scammed they&#039;re essentially starting an investigation on a honest sr member.<br />Just thought i&#039;d share what I have been doing with this community of ignorant drug users. enjoy.

				I dont get the scam coz we dont have moneypaks in my country (i dont think)<br /><br />but I think hes talking about he is opening and account saying hes a vendor, then offering samples? and using those adress&#039;s?<br /><br />but he would have to pay $150 per vendor accoutn. so im not really understanding.<br /><br />also when i ask for samples off vendors, i dont give my address or name, im smarter than that, i use a burner, So go ahead and use my name/address i supply. i dont give a fuck. u might as well just open the phone directory and pick one at random??? <br /><br />

				I get the feeling this kid didn&#039;t know it costs $150 to open a vendor account before he made up this story to show what a criminal mastermind he is.<br /><br />I mean seriously, if you got a source for arbitrary SSNs the names and addresses are not a big deal. Fuck dude scrape any online whitepages.<br /><br />Your story makes no fucking sense. Amateur.

				With out reading everything here all over again. <br />This lacks a lot of sense.<br /><br />&quot;pretending&quot; to be a vendor and harvesting buyers names and addresses does NOT help YOU get a Greendot card delivered to YOUR address.<br />Also we all know you need a SSN to get a greendot card.<br /><br />So while you have been pretending to be a vendor...do you tell these buyers <br />&quot;Limit one sample per a customer - please include your SSN so that I know no one is trying to get more then one sample&quot; ?<br /><br />...... fucking duh brah. You whack.<br />

				I&#039;m with GUS, I can&#039;t see wtf someone can do with just a name and address (probably fake) anyway, you would need other information to be able to do anything meaningful with it, I call bullshit. Oh yeah sorry I&#039;m obviously&nbsp; too dumb to understand how the OP&#039;s secret methods actually obtained all the other info, pffffffft yeah ok mate.<br /><br />Does anyone really give out their real name and address on the enticement of free samples?? I bloody hope not.<br /><br />Nothing to see here, move on people... don&#039;t feed this troll anymore
