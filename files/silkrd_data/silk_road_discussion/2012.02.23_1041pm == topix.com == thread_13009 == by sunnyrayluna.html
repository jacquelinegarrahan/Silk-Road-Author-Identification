				I have used it, briefly.<br /><br />In fact it is how I managed to find this site eventually.<br /><br />My story is that I needed some diazepam and the online pharmacies (Europe) just seem to be charging too much now, so I looked elsewhere.&nbsp; I spend some time researching and found a guy selling from Cambodia where diaz is counter bought and very cheap.&nbsp; He sold to a few then scammed a lot when his rep was ok.&nbsp; Including me.<br /><br />However, I then used a well known person there to get some vals from Glasgow.&nbsp; They came through and are fine (I just had one in fact to sleep which is all i use them for).&nbsp; However, they are not pharma afaik, even though sold as such.&nbsp; They seem ok and she has massive good feedback.&nbsp; They are 10m but feel more like 5.<br /><br />However, if you are here - there is no need to go there - a lot of scamming and bitching.&nbsp; You also have to give addresses and email out to the sellers...never saw anyone using anything encrypted.<br /><br />I would use her again, but then found this place.
