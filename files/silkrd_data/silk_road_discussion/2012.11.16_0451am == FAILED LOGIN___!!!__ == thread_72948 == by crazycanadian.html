				Site is really bugged at the mo, not much you can do about it. Dont block up the server constantly trying just give it a break. Chances are once your in you&#039;ll be logged back out soon too, alot of people are getting this problem

				My session would bounce around 10 minutes or so after logging in. But it wasn&#039;t unbearable, just did my thing a bit faster and jumped off to make room for others needing to shop.. Our Road is back, I rounded up some coins, placed an order...and smiled knowing that my treatment options had returned.<br /><br />- eb&nbsp; 8)

I still haven&#039;t received my 150 BTC&#039;s from the 10th but the only reason I can tell that is by looking at the block chain again since I can&#039;t get to my account anymore but it&#039;s still there. If you give me your user name I can check if it&#039;s still active, assuming this isn&#039;t your real name.

				i start thinking these drugged people tend to forget their passwords while SR is one week down<br />and then they start blaming scammers and the whole world<br /><br />just be patient as the site might still have some troubles..<br /><br />didnt dpr tell us he would provide more information as soon as he sorted out everything?<br />still having no update makes me believe there are still issues and they are working hard on it.<br /><br /><br />and i read about the possibility that some relays might block silkroad already, anyone has enough technical insight to confirm?

				I logged in at 7am this morning.&nbsp; Account looks fine. My 10 btc were still there.&nbsp; I finalized an existing order, and also sent another couple of coins to my SR wallet. The coins took 40 mins to hit my wallet, so pretty standard.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d also received a msg from a vendor, and replied - the msg system seems to be working fine.<br /><br />Once my extra coins arrived I placed a new order. Phew!&nbsp; So, for me, functionality is operating normally.<br /><br />My business is now done, so I&#039;m logging out and won&#039;t be going back in till tomorrow to check my order is shipped.&nbsp; I hope everyone elses problems resolve soon and we can all get back to normal.<br /><br />Cheers<br />PTF
