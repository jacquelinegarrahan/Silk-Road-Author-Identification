				Well, the title says it all. I&#039;ve done some searching through the forums and couldn&#039;t find too much information about any vendors who&#039;ve been busted vending on the road.<br /><br />I&#039;m eager to learn about those who&#039;ve been busted. Where did they go wrong. How were they busted. What lessons have we learned as a result.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				Shad1 is the only vendor bust I&#039;ve heard of. <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t actually caught on SR.. He was importing drugs in the mail and they caught him, then watched his mail and found a large amount of drugs so raided his house - found more drugs. Then he must have just admitted to being part of SR.<br /><br /><br />The idiot had his number plate on his car as his vendor username&nbsp; :o

				There was a DMT vendor from Canada that got busted last Summer as well. He wasn&#039;t busted as a result of his SR operation. However, when mainstream news of this huge bust for DMT came out, it appeared the man in question had the same stuff written on his facebook profile as he had on his SR profile, so we were left with the conclusion that it had to be him.<br /><br />If I remember correctly, he had a DMT extraction setup in the basement of his rented house. Anyway, his neighbours expressed concern about all the people that were calling to the house for very brief periods of time, even during the middle of the night. Basically, it was obvious to his neighbours that he was dealing in some capacity. So, next thing you know, he was busted and at the same time, his listings on SR went down.

				So it kind of sounds like a lot of the busts that have happened were most likely incurred due to a lack of practicing good operational security, being a little lazy, and maybe a bit too much co-mingling of activities between SR and real life.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe someone would use their SR username as their license plate.

				this is why silk road is a brilliant invention, vendors risks are low and so are buyers. You both know what you expect no stings or setups.<br /><br />very happy to be a SR vendor, but would advise other vendors to stay anonymous once you are off tor and bitcoins and on street taking cash or WU/MG paypal thats risky.

				Yeah, it doesn&#039;t seem like SR has ever been compromised itself, just outside of SR and people blabbing like idiots.<br /><br />Best part of the SR is that no one involved could compromise it and sell everyone out, as far as I know, in order to save their own asses if they got busted. Doubtless LEO already has accounts and knows how to sign onto the site, and that&#039;s clearly not enough to bust them because they would have done so by now.

And yes they probably have a dB of some sort. They will gather small bits and pieces until they can assemble a way to take the whole thing out. Some of those bits will come from the forums, some from SR and some from ?. We need to very careful what we say.

				So the bottom line is that we still have heard of no case where anyone, vendor or customer has been busted as a result of LE tracking them down via SR (is this statement correct? I have sort of looked and haven&#039;t seen any references otherwise).&nbsp; All the busts involving SR I&#039;ve heard about have been tracked back into SR AFTER the person has been burned already.&nbsp; This seems like good news to me.&nbsp; We are really lucky to have SR, IMO.<br /><br />Weeeeehaaaaaaaaaa! I just went to look for the stupid captcha and realize that it&#039;s gone - I hit 100. Now if I just had been smart enough to realize sometime before my 98th post that the captcha&#039;s aren&#039;t case sensitive...<br /><br />

				I&#039;m sure he means that SR is virtual as opposed to face to face dealing. No anonymity face to face except maybe using an alias. But for most vendors here, if we sold to a cop, all the cop gets is drugs and maybe a general geographic location of where they came from and maybe our shipping method at the time. But that&#039;s it. All the other information gleaned is useless to law enforcement.

				This is correct about dealing IRL. I am thinking about making a whole new thread about how Silk Road almost literally saved my life. I&#039;ve been a shroom hunter for many years and because I don&#039;t go and hustle it, I was forced to rely on middle men to stay safe and anonymous. Of course, the price I got was so low that it kept me in near indentured servitude and slavery for years and there was nothing I could do while they charged the highest prices. The markup was over 500% from me the hunter to the consumer<br /><br />Silk Road changed all that. Now i do it myself and am able to charge cheaper and more reasonable price and still make 3 times what I made before IRL and now for the first time I can make enough to actually support my hunting without fucking starving<br /><br />I have no idea if cutting out middle men is possible with the bigger manufactured chemicals, but for a small time pro hunter of mushrooms like myself, Silk Road and DPR saved my life<br /><br />and I think that&#039;s what Silk Road is all about, helping to cut out the middle men and other problems associated with selling IRL. It was never possible for me to do this IRL without middle men before Silk Road came along....too risky<br /><br />it was starvation wages before-not even minimum wage. Now I can at least make a modest living. Thank you DPR and Silk Road!<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148534.msg1021810#msg1021810">Quote from: BenJesuit on April 16, 2013, 05:17 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148534.msg1021610#msg1021610">Quote from: jacklinks on April 16, 2013, 03:59 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">SourDieselMan and HashBean are two well known vendors who got into legal trouble.
