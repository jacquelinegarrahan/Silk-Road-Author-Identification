				^^^ It&#039;s not down, but it might as well be. I&#039;m logged in but I can&#039;t get anything done. I literally had everything in my cart ready to buy (just had to put money into my account) but prices have fluctuated enough so that I barely (less than .01 btc) don&#039;t have enough. Need to drop one item to buy the rest now but it seems impossible.

				Yeah I&#039;m having the same problem. I found that as long as you only try to load one page at a time and give it a good five to ten minutes to load it&#039;ll work. I need to get my orders in because I dried up and still have people hitting me up for more stuff. around Christmas is the worst time to run out of product cuz so many people want to buy drugs. <br />-Purplefloyd

				Tornet is just slow, period. Sometimes using new identity helps but in general Tor is much much slower than clearnet. The price you pay for having the freedom to purchase illegal things.

				Two changes have occurred; Recently, some of the tor relays say stuff like this &quot;Bandwidth: 61.00 KB/s&quot; which.. I&#039;m sure you can understand, makes tor very slow.<br /><br />The other thing I think is happening is that SR is rate-limiting users. A certain amount of browsing/refreshing is okay, too much data and you get limited. Likely, the reason incognito-mode is sometimes seen as a solution to being rate-limited is because it tells the server to not even bother sending pictures and the like, thus using less bandwidth.<br /><br />That&#039;s my theories, at least. :)
