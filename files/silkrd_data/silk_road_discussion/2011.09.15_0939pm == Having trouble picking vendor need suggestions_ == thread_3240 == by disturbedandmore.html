				Since the first day on silkroads I saw a name that stuck and was very reputable which is LexiSadie. When he has weed I know its good. I like that he ships from within the US so I will get it faster but also wont ship more thank 1/8 and I understand, its because he is a very safe seller. But also I was looking at mrouid, ships from canada so wont get here as fast, not guaranteed that it will get past customs but prices are alot cheaper and ships over an ounce at once. I am looking to get about a half ounce of some good weed (which there is not to much around were I live)<br /><br />So who should I go with:&nbsp; LexiSadie&nbsp; or&nbsp; mrouid<br /><br />Thanks,<br />disturbedandmore

				i would go with mroid if your wanting quantity because buying a half ounce by the gram for 20$ a gram is going to be expensive.&nbsp; roughly 14*20=280$.&nbsp; even with his mixed strain it comes out to 75$ an 8th and there are 4 8ths in half ounce so 300.&nbsp; thats crazy.&nbsp; The weed cant be that much better.&nbsp; Lexi Sadie is for people looking for small amounts

				MrOuid is legit and has good weed at great prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s gonna be compressed though so remember that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a big deal if you use a grinder anyways but it&#039;s just the way it is for transporting safely and all from another country.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />LexiSadie has some very good weed at high prices because it&#039;s mainly all grams.&nbsp; It&#039;s quality and delivered intact with no crushage though.<br /><br />Also Check out 420med4u&nbsp; &nbsp;They have fantastic weed and great shipping methods.<br />Also Listentothemusic when listings are up.&nbsp; Both are empty right now but check back.<br /><br />Anarcho47 has good reviews as another canadian vendor btw.

				Have you looked at my listings?&nbsp; I have a 100% sativa that will knock your socks off and I can sell up to 1oz - 75% of my business is to the US from Canada.<br /><br />Oh, just noticed.&nbsp; Thanks for the ups, Jack ;)
