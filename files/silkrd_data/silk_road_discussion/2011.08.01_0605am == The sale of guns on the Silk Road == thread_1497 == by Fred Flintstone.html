				Quoted from the Silk Road Seller&#039;s Guide: &quot;Practically speaking, there are many powerful adversaries of Silk Road and if we are to survive, we must not take them all on at once.&quot; <br /><br />I feel that the sale of guns on the Silk Road is a guaranteed way to attract unwanted attention from LE and politicians. While drugs are certainly controversial, many liberal and libertarian minded people are against current drug policies and thus more tolerant. Selling illegal guns is going to lose the support of many of those liberals. Besides, it appears that illegal firearm sales account for little to no business on SR. I see little benefit in allowing their sale.<br /><br />What do you think?

				I voted no for only one reason...those who currently own guns are generally white males, (some in law enforcement) who are backward and uneducated. However, I am in favor for the ex-cons, the radicals, the communists, anarchist, the oppressed, and those who suffer abuse from the dominant Anglo culture in America to possess all the gun and ammo they can get (including C4 and proper training). This is with the implicit intent to bring about change in this failed system called America.

				Nothing will get SR shut down faster than some kid shooting up his school with an illegal gun purchased on here. People are funny about things like that. If some unfortunate recreational drug user ODs, mainstream society doesn&#039;t give a shit. If 60 minutes finds out that some socially awkward kid killed off his english lit class with a gun from the internet, we are done for. If we continue to allow people to sell guns on here it is only a matter of time before this happens. Lets be smart and take action before something tragic goes down and its too late.

Why don&#039;t you go ask the cops how they did it? The technology only protects us so far. If you give the cops a good enough reason to come after you, they will.

				I voted no simply for the fact that guns don&#039;t kill people, people kill people. It&#039;s that simple, if someone really wanted to kill someone they&#039;ll find a way whether it&#039;s with a gun, an explosive, poison, or some other means they&#039;ll find a way. I truly believe that people have the right to bare arms.

				I definetally think it would be legitamate for SR to ban the sale of various items on this site, although it may be against the spirit of the site.<br /><br />Removal of the sale of particular items doesn&#039;t mean that they can&#039;t be traded elsewhere on tor with Bitcoins.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m not going to vote since I don&#039;t really know enough about the risks/benefits - but I would like SR to think carefully about this issue.

				Everything should be available on silk except for two exceptions. Atomic devices and Kid porn. And for the latter, those guys need to be castrated and their kneecaps broken so they can cripple around for the rest of their lives and think about what they had done. Killing is too good for them. Man I hate those guys. Come to think of it I would purchase a straight razor and a pistol on silk just to take care of these guys personally and by request. Scumbags that they are.

				The point is not whether or not people should have the right to bare arms. Has anyone on here that voted no actually bought a gun here? Has ANYONE bought a gun here? I agree people should have the right to bare (or bear ;)) arms, but on a realistic note, the sale of guns will give the media ammo for shooting down SR. <br /><br />I am not against people owning guns, I am against the publicity that would be associated with the sale of illegal guns. This will alienate SR from damn near every liberal out there! All this idealism talk about keeping yourself armed against the oppressors of evil America/whatever is just libertarian rhetoric that sounds like it was copy and pasted out of an extremist pamphlet.<br /><br />Before you answer the question of whether you think SR should sell guns or not, try asking yourself what are the real benefits and costs to you. Try looking at it from a realistic point of view. While I have no problem with people owning guns, I don&#039;t want to see SR get anymore negative attention. I am very much a realist. As a realist, I feel that the costs of selling guns far outweighs the benefits.<br /><br />(For me) The benefits of selling guns: It allows people to buy guns. Since I do not want to buy a gun, this is of little benefit to me.<br />(For me) The costs of selling guns: It gives the media/public more reason to hate SR and want to close it down.<br /><br />We have something very good going for us here and I would hate to see it fucked up over some idealist beliefs that the right to buy guns online is important enough to risk it all.

				I originally posted in favor of selling guns on SR but I think I&#039;ve changed my mind. Most things you can buy on here is intended for personal use and does not pose any inherent risk to others. Selling guns crosses that line. Guns are designed to inflict harm on others. It also causes added negative attention to this place. If someone OD&#039;s that&#039;s their issue. If someone shoots up a school with a gun purchased here, isnt SR partially responsible?

				Jeezus H CHrist this is not about who can or cannot have guns. Give every infant a gun on his first birthday if you want just don&#039;t buy it on SR.

				Since this is a &quot;community&quot; and SR has show he is very responsive to what needs and wants are voiced by the community, then the poll should decide the outcome of the guns issue.<br /><br />Then the outcome would be that the people get the marketplace they want and support and it provides exactly the service that *most* of the people want without any undue attention from things that *most* of the people don&#039;t want to see at SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always also thought the best argument was that, when used properly, recreational drugs kill 0% of the people but, when used properly , guns kill 100% of the people.&nbsp; And I&#039;m sure one of SR&#039;s goals is NOT to kill people or assist in killing people.<br /><br />But that&#039;s just me. ;)

Your argument is totally valid. That being said, the point of SR seems to be a open drug market - which is what the vast majority of SR members use it for. Sure, the sale of drugs will bring heat from law enforcement - and it already has. I do not disagree with this. My entire point is not to eliminate all things illegal, it is to limit our risk. For the same reason we wouldn&#039;t want to sell weapons of mass destruction or people&#039;s credit card numbers, we want to attract as little heat as possible. <br /><br />Just look at the recent CP bust. They deserve to die a slow death, but that is aside the point. CP (like guns, drugs, and other illegal items) will attract attention from certain people who will try their hardest to put an end to it. The fewer illegal things going on, the less attention we draw to SR. Since drugs account for well over 90% of SR sales (correct me if I&#039;m wrong) and guns account for less than 5% (again, correct me if I&#039;m wrong) are those 5% of sales really worth the extra added risk and exposure SR will have to face? My argument is based entirely on logic, this is not a moral argument against the sale of guns.<br /><br />There is no right or wrong answer and I am glad to see such strong debate over this.

I am personally very pro gun rights. I do believe that anyone mentally stable has the right to bear arms.

And probably more likely to do something stupid. And when asked where they got the gun? The answer will be Silk Road, which could fuel some kind of public outrage to shut this site down. While its true there is a moral component to the argument. I think unwanted attention is the biggest factor. &quot;Convicted felon buys gun off SR and shuts up a 7-11, more at 11&quot; not a headline I want to see.... &quot;All good things must come to an end&quot; I would like that to be later rather than sooner :). Interesting debate we got going here nonetheless...

				^ Touche! A very solid rebuttal. Seeing as we are on the same page about removing guns from SR and I agree with what you are saying I will end it at that ;)<br /><br />With all the risk associated with selling guns I feel it is hard to justify. Most of the pro-gun arguments are essentially &quot;arm the masses&quot; or &quot;we should all own guns&quot; or &quot;Arm minorities!&quot; While you might believe that everyone has the right to own a gun, does it really justify the risk of bringing more heat on SR?

				Do you think this is a &quot;democracy&quot;?

If you don&#039;t like it&#039;s policies you can ask the owner to consider changes but ultimately if they don&#039;t meet your requirement you are perfectly free to stop using it&#039;s services.<br /><br />The arguments made have validity but it isn&#039;t &quot;our&quot; choice until &quot;we&quot; &quot;vote&quot; with our wallets (by not spending here) or our feet (by going elsewhere).<br /><br />That is the reality, no amount of political campaigning will change it.

I am an advocate of removing guns, but campaigning makes it sound so much more active than simply creating a thread to point out the inherent risks of selling guns. I don&#039;t want to knit-pick, you are correct.<br /><br />I did not suggest that the results of this poll might force anything. I said: &quot;If enough people wanted guns removed then perhaps SR would be willing to remove them,&quot; which is to say that if enough people wanted guns removed then SR may be willing to remove them. Nothing more. &quot;But as it stands the vote to have them removed is barely in the lead,&quot; meaning that since nearly as many people want guns to stay, it is highly unlikely that they will be removed. I am not trying to force anyone to do anything, just promoting civil debate.<br /><br />To reiterate, I never suggested to boycott. I did not create this thread to fight against SR. I created this thread in SR&#039;s best interest - I want this place to stay around for as long as possible. I am not in any way morally opposed to guns and actually own a few myself. I simply see the sale of illegal guns as a possible threat to the future of SR.<br /><br />I completely understand that you see a free place and don&#039;t want it regulated, but need I point out that there are already regulations in place. As it says in the Sellers Guide, &quot;Please do not list anything who&#039;s purpose is to harm or defraud, such as stolen credit cards, counterfeit currency, personal info, assassinations, and weapons of mass destruction (chemical/bio weaponry, nukes, and anything used to make them). Please do not list anything related to pedophelia.&quot; These are regulations which are already in place for a good reason. I believe guns should be on that list. You do not, and I respect that. <br /><br />My goal was not to irk you. I am not some radical trying to stop on peoples rights. I heard a few people mention that they wanted guns removed from SR so I figured I would create a poll to see how the general populace felt. It is SR&#039;s choice, I know that and never suggested otherwise.

				It&#039;s cool. I&#039;m not calling anyone out, I just have to state my observations.<br />I&#039;ll leave it at this:<br /><br />I see what looks like the very reason we are hiding here going on here.&nbsp; Democracy (well, totalitarianism in some places too). The mob rule. It starts with a small core group, or usually several.<br />They point out POTENTIAL dangers in a given behavior. They then successfully convince a majority (even though this majority could consist of groups that would disagree about almost every other issue) that a POTENTIAL danger is justification to gang up and deprive someone who has actually harmed no one or damaged no property of their rights to use their property as they wish.<br /><br />In our case that&nbsp; property is our bodies, someone MIGHT die, or delve into sociopathic actions as a result of taking drugs. The core groups are moral &quot;authoritarians&quot; and &quot;total safety at all cost freaks&quot;. The mob is the sectors of the population subscribing to these rantings (rather than thinking for themselves).<br />In the case of this thread it is the potential to lose the place for us all. But again, it isn&#039;t our place. The mob is forming nonetheless.<br /><br />When I see what MIGHT be (drummed into a majority of minds by a few groups) be allowed to take precedence over anyone&#039;s rights to do as they please as long as they harm no one I see a bad moon rising.<br />It&#039;s been going on for way too long and anyone sick of hiding here should keep in mind the politics (and mind control put out by such a small bit of the total population)&nbsp; that put us here in hiding in the first place.<br />And seek to correct that behavior in themselves and spread the word to others.<br /><br />The only vote that does not seek dominance over others is the vote(s) we cast every day with our purchasing decisions.<br /><br />As far as the only reason someone would buy a gun here must mean they wish to initiate aggression???? Maybe they just don&#039;t want it confiscated by being on the list when it comes to that.<br />The same goes for buyers of gold, it was confiscated from US citizens in 33 when the FDR administration was desperate. They were no where near as desperate as all governments are now.<br /><br />The list of gun grabbing regimes that later slaughtered much of their own populations is fairly long. In the US the National Guard went through New Orleans grabbing guns and the gangs followed, looting the unarmed.<br /><br />We now have flash mobs appearing and the witnesses have all said &quot;Only the National Guard could handle this, it&#039;s too much for the police&quot;<br />Look at London right now.<br /><br />The time for a massive gun grab is looking riper every day.<br />Of course if all citizens were armed and not brainwashed into depending on government guns to protect them it would be a different story. That&#039;s what those guys in 1776 had in mind.

				I don&#039;t think that shutting down the weapons section will remove the focus from SR. If they want to get rid of SR, news like &quot;massacre started with gun-buy at SR&quot; would be good. But if they want to, news like &quot;15 kids died last week in Anywhere, Idaho by drugs bought on SR&quot; would do the same and is easier to accomplish. They will fake anything (remember the preservativeless-wikileaks-raper, the great iraqi array of chemical weapons leading us to &quot;Iraqi Freedom&quot; or the bomb explosion at Bologna in 1980 causing 85 deaths and 200 wounded) if they want to.<br /><br />So it is just a question if&nbsp; this network is secured or not. I came to you about Bitcoins in general which leads to an article in a big german magazine about SR. So SR has already drawn attention even across the ocean. And I think the DEA alone is enough to hunt you down if it&#039;s possible, they don&#039;t need the help (or better interference) of other ones, when they become the order. Maybe the DEA must fill out a lot of papers to get access to GPU-Power from other departments but thats it. <br /><br />Therefore I think the main argument against the weapons section isn&#039;t one useful.<br /><br />My point is that we&#039;re already out of system for using some substances. So it doesn&#039;t matter if we&#039;re trading other illegal things (to children pornography, I think those kind of users are a very small &quot;minority&quot; and illegal in every country round the world so we needn&#039;t discuss this). You can use drugs offered here to rape someone or do some other cruel things, even kill unnoticed with an overdose of &quot;legal&quot; medics sold here. So there is no great step to things you can do with weapons.<br /><br />And times may go hard - there may be uprisings as things turn, see Tottenham in London today and last nights, see the banlieus of Paris sometimes every year, see some of the suburbs in the US almost everyday. There&#039;s a &quot;little tendency&quot; in Germany to fascism in those times and I don&#039;t wanna live undefended then. But you have to be rich or famous or otherwise endangered to get a weapon legal here, except for sport shooters. Not very easy, but think on other countries already living under suppressive regimes. So there are many illegal, but right reasons to support people with weapons. <br /><br />I think thats included in the self-understatement of Bitcoins : to present a mirror of todays money culture but without states interference. Weapons are sold for money. Germany just sold some nice tanks to Saudi-Arabia, just for keeping up the democracy in Bahrain! So weapons should also be sold for BC and SR is the right platform as it&#039;s already out-of-law and some of the cannon fodder already aiming at the Bitcoin-project itself!<br /><br />And to terrorism : anything legal in any state of the US shouldn&#039;t be the problem - so anything till automatic weapons shouldn&#039;t be the problem (as stated in other articles, you have to remove some tiles easily bought separately). You mustn&#039;t come with RPG, Stinger, C4 or whole weapon platforms but Osama&#039;s fellowers can supply themselves with AK-47s (and will laugh about the egyptian Beretta offered here as HS will do). <br /><br />&nbsp;Could write further and further but think I&#039;ve annoyed you enough and should close my first post here with the deepest beg for keeping the weapons section alive if it&#039;s possible to maintain security.

				Lots of discussion. A lot to read. So I didn&#039;t read all of it. Sorry if I&#039;m repeating someone else&#039;s post.<br /><br />It seems to me that there are only four possible outcomes for SilkRoad:<br /><br />1) SR fades peacefully away because of disinterest, malfeasance or error and ceases to exist. An unlikely outcome I think; <br /><br />2) SR continues pretty much unchanged from today. In other words, doesn&#039;t grow much, if at all, beyond today&#039;s population and doesn&#039;t do something to gain notariety. While possible, I do not think this is a certainty in the least; <br /><br />3) SR is taken down &quot;softly&quot;. By &quot;softly&quot;, I mean that the Feds target the site and the operators, but don&#039;t bother with members since it is really just the market place itself that is of consequence. Frankly, I think this is the most likely outcome over the long term; <br /><br />4) The outcome that is the worst case scenario is also the key to this discussion. If the Feds come after SR simply because it is a market for drugs, things come soft. If, on the other hand, the Feds come barging in because they are chasing an egregious act by a buyer that was enabled by SR, they will spend whatever it takes to track every member to either a dead end or an arrest.<br /><br />I want weapons banned.&nbsp; They can ONLY harm Silk Road in the worst possible way. All things that can propel SR into outcome #4 need a keen, hard look.<br /><br />Final point. If you question how they can possibly take down a TOR site, just consider how they found and took down Osama. I can&#039;t imagine that, given enough motivation, the Feds couldn&#039;t do it.

Drugs can certainly be used to rape or kill, but in the eyes of LE they do not pose as big a threat as guns. <br /><br />Selling guns is just another way to attract more unwanted attention.

				I would never deprive my neighbor, or his family, of his right to life.<br /><br />Gun haters defend their helplessness. They are offended by one who can protect his family, when he choose not to. Having the right to live is NOT the same as being able.<br /><br />Cry to the news reporter that there was nothing you could do? How such things could never happen in YOUR neighborhood, because you&#039;re protected by some magical force-field of rainbows and unicorns?<br /><br />To choose to be helpless and unable to preserve yourself and your friends/family is your choice. To force that handicap upon others, because seeing someone else make a better choice than you is offensive, is the most sick and demented thing I have ever heard of. I don&#039;t think that paraplegics want to force everyone with working legs to use wheelchairs just because they are stuck in one...<br /><br />So you don&#039;t care about your family or your friends. Fine. Me and Mine deserve better than that. Unsavory elements of humanity that are willing to kill you for a nickle DO exist. It happens to someone every few minutes. What makes you so special that you think it can&#039;t happen to you? Read a newspaper lately? Nobody thinks it can happen to themselves, until it does.<br /><br />Several times a day, a kid gets murdered and the parent says &quot;There was nothing I could do!&quot; Really? Where was your gun, asshole? Your kid is dead because you put politics above your own child&#039;s life! That&#039;s fucking sick!<br /><br />I&#039;ll supply a firearm to anyone. Yes, anyone. You don&#039;t need a gun to be a thug or a murderer, nor does it make the job any easier. You could kill your neighbor with at least 40 items you have laying around the house right now; why buy a gun on the Internet Black Market and make it so difficult and complicated for yourself? Dur...<br /><br />This isn&#039;t even an argument. gun haters are merely people who aren&#039;t bright enough to see through propaganda and become champions of hatred in favor of the lies they have fallen for.<br /><br />I realize it brings heat to SR. But far less than the drugs already do. That&#039;s like comparing a mount to a mole-hill and pretending the molehill is a problem. How many &#039;illegal gun sting&#039; operations have you ever heard of? Yes, zero. It&#039;s not a priority for LE. Most of them have no idea what they&#039;re looking at when they see a gun, to know if there is something illegal about it or not. But that leafy green substance, or that unidentified white powder is a license to invade and kill, and that is what their giant egos live for. The search incident to drug arrest turns up the hidden gun taht wasn&#039;t used or even known about until they were already under arrest for drugs....<br /><br />Get a clue, gun-haters. You&#039;re hypocrites. You&#039;re just as bad as the cops that arrested your last supplier... No freedom or human right has ever been won peaceably. EVER. V for Vendetta was a cool movie, but it&#039;s just a movie. History shows that it never has, and never will go down that way... Put down the pipe for a few days and think about it. I&#039;m all for your Right to toke until you fall down. But I expect a little sanity and rational thinking now and again. If you could ban guns (which you can&#039;t), your pot would be gone quite soon after.<br /><br />Try to realize we&#039;re on the same team and the propaganda you&#039;ve swallowed is a pack of lies. Step into the light, Brothers. You&#039;re only hurting yourselves...

				Nef, I couldn&#039;t have said it better myself. Thank you! As for your question as to why people would want to buy guns from SR as opposed to walmart, I can only think of a few possibilities.<br /><br />1) They are felons and thus unable to buy guns.<br />2) They do not want to be in a database as being a registered gun owner.<br />3) They live in a country with strict gun control laws.<br /><br />Am I missing anything?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1497.msg15338#msg15338">Quote from: drp2p on August 11, 2011, 05:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fred...<br />I present a cogent syllogism rooted in knowledge, wisdom and understanding regarding why weapons must be sold on SR.&nbsp; My position is rooted in anger with a sense of empathy for social injustices that I have witnessed.

Why is it that you feel we all must arm ourselves, and what are these ambitions you speak of? If these ambitions include change by force, then the the sale of guns, ammo and C4 to arm people is akin to a violent revolution bordering on terrorism. If these ambitions are to protect ourselves, then why on earth would we need C4?&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not trying to put words in your mouth, but when you speak of arming people with high explosives I can only assume it is an active attempt to force change. What other reason would you have for arming people with high explosives? I can&#039;t think of a better way to get SR shut down than for supplying high explosives to people who want to use them maliciously.<br /><br />I am a strong advocate of each person doing whatever the hell they want, as long as it doesn&#039;t infringe on someone else&#039;s rights. It is one thing for people to purchase drugs for personal consumption, it is an entirely different thing to arm people with high explosives. Please correct me if I have misunderstood your point.

				@nef<br /><br />&nbsp; You make some good points.&nbsp; I think the main reason someone might buy weapons on SR is because of gun control laws in the area where they live.&nbsp; The logistics of how this can be done anonymously is a separate issue, but one possibility is that the weapon is broken down into parts and sent in multiple shipments, there may be other methods.&nbsp; &nbsp;SR has decided to assume the risk of having this category in his market in order to get his cut on the deals.&nbsp; The individuals involved assume their risk in making the transaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; What is unclear is why &quot;weaponry&quot; is considered a greater risk to SR&#039;s market as a whole.&nbsp; Aren&#039;t we operating under the assumption that the technology makes a &quot;takedown&quot; of the market near impossible? My understanding of LE is that they are focused on making arrests of all and any kind.&nbsp; What is the basis for the claim that enforcement of gun laws takes precedent over drug laws?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; this is SR&#039;s decision, and we should respect that. I&#039;m sure he considered the ramifications of &quot;weaponry&quot; before adding the section.&nbsp; It&#039;s his risk to take, and if it leads to the downfall of his market,&nbsp; another market will quickly rise to replace it.&nbsp; We are all free to take the initiative to create whatever type of onion sites we like and compete with SR if we don&#039;t like what he is doing. <br /><br />

I feel that selling guns is simply another added risk. Since weapon sales account for so little of SR&#039;s total sales, I question whether it is worth that additional risk. That is basically my whole argument for removing guns - the added risk. I have no moral or ethical issues with gun ownership and, as I have mentioned, own a few guns myself. <br /><br />I am not computer savvy enough to tell you for certain one way or another, but I highly doubt a &quot;takedown&quot; would be impossible. With enough resources and support, the government likely has the power to pursue SR. The sale of illegal guns is just one more reason for the government to want to put an end to this great market. Silk Road has given me and many others access to drugs that are hard to find and dangerous to buy on the streets, and I would hate to see that taken away. <br /><br />Yes it is SR&#039;s decision and I do respect that. I truly hope that this thread is not seen as an attack on how SR runs their business. This thread is here to discuss the pros and cons of selling guns on SR - I am not trying to force SR make any changes. I love what SR is doing, and respect the hell out of all the effort they have put into this place and support them 100%. <br /><br />I am really interested in what SilkRoad and the moderators have to say about this topic as I would imagine they have put far more thought into the decision to allow the sale of weapons than any of us.<br /><br />

I don&#039;t want to see this place shut down because of you anti-government extremists talking about violently overthrowing the government.

				drp2p,<br /><br />It is late and I am not in a clear state of mind so if I am not making sense then I apologize, but I will try and get my point across. <br /><br />I agree that change is happening, however that is not the whole picture. Being in the front lines of change involving the piracy of media (such as Pirate Bay) and being in the front lines of the kind of change requiring high explosives and illegal weapons is a whole different ballgame. You know this, I know this and the government knows this. The resources put forth towards preventing illegal downloading is nowhere near the resources put towards anti-terrorism.<br /><br />A bunch of laid back drug users buying drugs isn&#039;t going to receive the same resistance from authorities as extremists buying and selling guns and explosives. <br /><br />I want no part in any violent change and I certainly don&#039;t want to be in the same cross-hairs as terrorists.<br /><br />I am not trying to fight for violent change, I just want a place where I can safely buy substances for my own personal use. Perhaps SR could have a drugs-only website and then an &quot;everything else&quot; website. I&#039;m just throwing that out there as an idea so please don&#039;t say I am &quot;politically campaigning&quot; to force SR to make changes or anything.<br /><br />Thank you drp2p for keeping this discussion civil, I enjoy hearing your point of view on this issue.

				Maybe I can help.&nbsp; I know quite a bit about firearms and laws surrounding firearms.&nbsp; Reading the thread, I think we all want the same thing - no guns in the hands of anyone irresponsible or mal-intentioned.&nbsp; However, since we&#039;re all on SR for the same reason, I suspect none of us has a problem facilitating the sale of guns or gun parts to responsible adults.&nbsp; The question would be how to achieve this.&nbsp; Believe it or not, laws provide some clarity here.<br /><br />I propose...<br /><br />1. No international shipping of any complete firearm.&nbsp; Keep it simple.<br /><br />2. No pistol sales.&nbsp; Pistols cannot be legally transferred to another individual in nearly any state in the US without notifying appropriate law enforcement entities. Pistols are so tightly regulated, keep it simple.<br /><br />3. No Class III firearms, such as short barrel rifles (SBRs).&nbsp; These require a special ATF process and even when legal, cannot generally be transferred out of one state to the next.&nbsp; So keep it simple. <br /><br />4. No automatic or banned firearms.&nbsp; These would sell for several thousands of dollars anyway, so practically speaking, there&#039;s no point opening the door. Keep it simple.&nbsp; <br /><br />Examples of legitimate firearm sales on SR...<br /><br />a. Rifles&nbsp; (so long as it&#039;s not automatic, rule #4, or Class III like an SBR, rule #3). In many states there&#039;s no law that restricts individual sales of rifles from person to person anyway.&nbsp; Many states don&#039;t even track the initial sale from the manufacturer.&nbsp; <br /><br />b. Firearm parts.&nbsp; Lightening links, suppressors, etc. <br /><br />c. Uppers/Lowers.&nbsp; Generally goes along with rifles and firearm parts.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Anyhow, restricting the sale of pistols, allowing rifles but not auto or class III, I think achieves what we&#039;re all trying to do here.&nbsp; Facilitate the sale of firearms and firearm parts to enthusiasts and collectors and minimize collateral damage.&nbsp; I think some middle-ground can be achieved here.

It can be done peacefully (mostly, a dying beast WILL thrash around a bit first) by understanding REAL economics and how currency manipulation (a government/corporate partnership) has collected power AND CONSUMED a huge part of the worlds capital stock....wasted it instead of growing it just so they could own you and your bodies energies. And your grandchildrens. Theft through inflation. The redistribution (hidden service) of real wealth via the vehicle of forced bullshit devaluing every day script.<br /><br />But more people are seeing it. Everyone knows something is up and a few assholes will organize and inspire mobs to attack the WRONG people...some poor shop owner who&#039;s only crime was to try to succeed in a world that is almost totally rigged. It does help keep the public eye redirected away from those who really understand and are adamantly trying to educate.<br />And it does a great job of fooling people into thinking what we have is capitalism when it is really corporatism, an evil impossible without the backing of a force seen as a legitimate monopoly on law and use of force. Capitalism is but a component within corporatism, it&#039;s the only good and decent part of it and before the ass hats came in and claimed that government has created civilization private property, specialization, production and trade had already done so, far better than the leeches who are ruining could.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot Thorough in that list: &quot;There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil for every one striking at the root.<br /><br /><br />In a world where no one has any legitimate reason save defense of person and property to act in aggression it won&#039;t matter WHAT we have access to. Saying that possession of C4 WILL lead to the initiation of aggression (rather than defense from the initiator) is like saying the possession of a penis WILL lead to a rape.<br /><br />Change IS happening. Listen to those who have figured out how an (unqualified) elite has captured our souls and figure out how to WITHDRAW our support from their systems.<br /><br />Add Sam Konkin to that list and look up Agorism and counter economics. That IS what we are engaging in here.<br />Well, we would be if the bitcoin were not so tied to the USD like every other form of money.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t vote in this poll because I am done contributing to the mob rule mentality voting leads to.<br />But I will vote for Ron Paul if I get the chance. Not because I want a president or a government but because every bit of support he gets leads to more education on the root of the evil we are hiding from in here.

				Nicely put BP. Very Ayn Randesque... and about as long as Atlas Shrugged too ;) Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart are my heroes. By the way, who is John Galt?<br /><br />I agree with a lot of what you said. But &quot;Saying that possession of C4 WILL lead to the initiation of aggression (rather than defense from the initiator) is like saying the possession of a penis WILL lead to a rape.&quot; Which I find to be a very poor analogy. The sole purpose of C4 is to blow shit up. When I hear a radical (or whatever you want to be called) speaking about changing the world through the use of force, putting C4 in their hands would likely lead to some sort of destruction. A penis&#039;s sole purpose isn&#039;t to rape (at least my penis) and, when wielded correctly, results in nobody getting hurt. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1497.msg16080#msg16080">Quote from: bp on August 13, 2011, 07:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;I didn&#039;t vote in this poll because I am done contributing to the mob rule mentality voting leads to.&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am really not trying to create mob mentality, it was really just created to see if there were that many gun supporters, which I was surprised to find there are.

My point of view is from a drug user who doesn&#039;t want guns to ruin it for me, so to speak. Your point may be a gun user who doesn&#039;t want drugs to ruin it for you. I&#039;m really not trying to label you extremists, I just don&#039;t know what exactly to call you. I am a perpetual devil&#039;s advocate, I hate all sides equally. Everything has pros and con and it is all about personal opinion when it comes to religion and politics - there is no absolute right and wrong. <br /><br />Perhaps I have been looking at this from the wrong prospective. We are all in the same boat and should support each other. I don&#039;t want an &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality with the drug and gun crowd, or with you Ricky and BP. Mutual support may be the best solution. I love the fact that we can buy and sell damn near anything, and I feel like a dick trying to tell anyone what they can and can&#039;t do. It entirely goes against my personal beliefs. <br /><br />But, I would just HATE to see SR shut down over some kid buying a gun and killing someone so I figured the best solution would simply be to remove guns. I figured that since guns only account for a minuscule part of the SR marketplace (there is only 1 gun for sale right now), nobody would care about removing guns. I was wrong. <br /><br />Silk Road is a community bonded together on more than simply buyers and sellers. We are here, as drp2p said, in the front lines of change. This is fighting the good fight - for the freedom to live without unjust constraints. The last thing I want to do is split this community into factions. If that means keeping the guns section on SR, I am all for it.<br />

				@BP<br /><br />My problem with voting doesn&#039;t apply to a survey like this.&nbsp; The problem with democratic systems is that the outcome of vote totals leads to the initiation of force of the majority on the minority.&nbsp; In a democracy, if you are in the minority and choose to resist the will of the voting majority then the majority will send a gang of people with guns and badges (cops) to prevent your resistance.&nbsp; Simply polling a group to determine group preferences is not tied to the violence of the state.&nbsp; Yes, the majority may &quot;win&quot; and the individuals reading the poll results, in this case SR, may choose to act to satisfy that majority.&nbsp; Yes, the minority may be disappointed with the outcome but nobody HERE will harm them for disagreeing or even for going elsewhere for their products (local gang members/government aside).<br /><br />That is exactly how ALL market systems work.&nbsp; People &quot;vote&quot; with their money for which goods and service they want from a given firm.&nbsp; I might REALLY want my local drug store to carry anchovy flavored toothpaste.&nbsp; However, the majority of people that &quot;vote&quot; with their dollars want other flavors of toothpaste.&nbsp; As the minority, I am excluded from being provided anchovy toothpaste however nobody will FORCE me to buy other flavors.&nbsp; Nobody will FORCE me not to seek out someone that will sell me anchovy toothpaste.&nbsp; Polls and voting are just another way that independent vendors determine what the majority of customers want.&nbsp; Yeah, it sucks if you want anchovy toothpaste but sucking is a lot different that being locked in a cage. If you feel so strongly about the fact that a particular seller doesn&#039;t provide what you want, then you have many other options.&nbsp; You may petition them to change, picket them, boycott them, convince the other customers to ask for what you want as well, educate others about the merits of your desired product, etc.&nbsp; However, the only restricted action is FORCING them to sell you the product.

				What&#039;s wrong with blowing shit up? I enjoy it.<br />That doesn&#039;t mean I want to harm anyone.<br />I don&#039;t even want to harm anyone actively aggressing against me.....but I will if I have to and by the right of my nature no one shall tell me what tools T can or cannot posses to prepare for that possibility.<br /><br />I want tanks, RPG, and FA18s at my local gun shop.

				I read through this post, and my suggestion is a compromise cos e&#039;erbody in tha club love compromise!<br /><br />Why not just create a totally separate new site called &quot;Rifles &amp; Jailbait Avenue&quot;?<br /><br />Sell all weapons and kid porn there. By creating a series of Silk Road-alikes with graded levels of merchandise, people can effectively choose their level of self-incrimination. There can also be sweet-ass GIF logos of dancing nude 12 year olds shooting at each other, instead of the camel rider on SR now.<br /><br />All your problems are now solved.<br />

				No no no no and NO!&nbsp; Get rid of guns on SR.&nbsp; Selling illegal weapons is on a whole different level than selling drugs.&nbsp; Think about who could have access to purchasing these guns (basically ANYONE with a computer)...now some of you might or might not have kids who go to school...I think you know where I&#039;m going with this.&nbsp; You DON&#039;T know who is buying them,&nbsp; so DON&#039;T sell them!&nbsp;

				Just wait till you see how the big crash in all levels of government employment and government handouts due to financial realty turn out.

No international shipping of any complete firearm.&nbsp; Keep it simple.<br /><br />2. No pistol sales.&nbsp; Pistols cannot be legally transferred to another individual in nearly any state in the US without notifying appropriate law enforcement entities. Pistols are so tightly regulated, keep it simple.<br /><br />3.

Keep it simple.&nbsp; <br /><br />Examples of legitimate firearm sales on SR...<br /><br />a. Rifles&nbsp; (so long as it&#039;s not automatic, rule #4, or Class III like an SBR, rule #3). In many states there&#039;s no law that restricts individual sales of rifles from person to person anyway.&nbsp; Many states don&#039;t even track the initial sale from the manufacturer.&nbsp; <br /><br />b. Firearm parts.&nbsp; Lightening links, suppressors, etc. <br /><br />c.

				All this talk of arming yourselves for protection from gang members, looters, the government, [insert other oppressor] may be legitimate but the fact remains that there is only one single gun for sale on SR. This has been the case for days. You have made your point about allowing the sale of guns as a moral argument but I just feel that due to the extremely small amount of business it brings to SR that, all politics aside, it is almost a moot point.

				What is everybody alarmed about? 2 maybe 3 vendors on an obscure site selling extremely overpriced weapons. Please, I can purchase case&#039;s of fully automatic assault weapons in 45 seconds from any gun show in any state with case&#039;s of rounds of ammo to go along with it, no questions asked. I&#039;ve done it. There&#039;s a gun show going on in every state, everyday at some point in this great country. Or a gun raffle put on by the VFW, Boy scouts, Fraternal Order of Police, Ladies Gun Clubs, and many other organizations too numerous to mention. The ATF ships guns to Mexico to track killings by cartel&#039;s. So don&#039;t get your bunghole in a knot over this, the people who want to get weapons are not going to wait for them to come in the mail while waiting for bitcoin escrow to finalize and leave feedback. And as for me, I&#039;ll be at a gun show in upstate New York this weekend where I&#039;ll be&nbsp; picking up a 1928 Thompson sub machine gun and a WWII era Browning Automatic Rifle or B.A.R for those of you who collect as I do, with enough ammo to start a small revolution. I love to blow stuff up at my range and don&#039;t come around my way without a good reason for being there. Semper Fi, Bikerbum

you are without a doubt right in many things.&nbsp; My opinion of guns is flawed and bias I will be the first to admit.&nbsp; I was part of the ex Yugoslavian war in the early 90s when I was a kid,&nbsp; then in the states I was in the Marines.&nbsp; I saw first hand not only family in yugoslavia but also friends in iraq and afghanistan gone from my life because of stupid wars.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know it sounds hypocritical considering I had a fully automatic gun in the service and was using it,&nbsp; but I truly know the power of a gun.&nbsp; That power in the wrong hands can cause some serious damage.&nbsp; I mean honestly think of how many people you see daily,&nbsp; in public,&nbsp; on tv,&nbsp; on the internet,&nbsp; etc,&nbsp; and then think just HOW MANY of these people are honestly intelligent enough to be able to use a gun properly aka (defending themselves).&nbsp; It&#039;s funny as Im typing this I just heard the lady on CNN say breaking news,&nbsp; a college somewhere in the US is locked down because of a shooter in there now.&nbsp; Like I couldn&#039;t have asked for better timing.&nbsp; I can tell you from first hand experience what it is like in ex yugoslavia now.&nbsp; Everyone has a gun there and problems are solved like this.&nbsp; Person A feels disrespected by Person B,&nbsp; Person A takes his gun and kills Person B.&nbsp; I know that sounds stupid and simple,&nbsp; but it honestly is like this.<br /><br />Just think for every peaceful well tempered person,&nbsp; there is a person who can&#039;t control his temper.&nbsp; Example,&nbsp; guy breaks up with his gf,&nbsp; lets say you Freeman start dating her,&nbsp; and lets say this guy is a bad tempered person and he owns a gun.&nbsp; In that short moment of pure rage and hatred and jealousy,&nbsp; that ex bf just became a lethal weapon.&nbsp; Now you Freeman would be dead for simply approaching a girl who was single,&nbsp; yet you might not have had any contact with her ex bf ever.&nbsp; I mean I honestly could list hundreds of scenarios and I could list links of that scenario actually happening.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like I was saying,&nbsp; I was infantry in the Marines,&nbsp; so without going into detail you can imagine what I was doing...<br /><br />BUT...Now I also see your point.&nbsp; I&#039;m sick of the government controlling what I can&#039;t put in my body and what I can&#039;t own or can own.&nbsp; If I want a gun,&nbsp; I SHOULD be able to have a gun,&nbsp; I agree 100% with you Freeman.&nbsp; I already had PTSD from my days as a kid before I ever joined the marines,&nbsp; somehow I passed their medical screening and that PTSD is worse now.&nbsp; I live in a state that has recently legalized Marijuana but due to the crazy fucking restrictions I can&#039;t get the meds I want.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want the pills that the doctors want to give me,&nbsp; not only because they are bad for your liver,&nbsp; but because I don&#039;t want those piece of shit prescription companies profiting off of me and my problem.&nbsp; Hence the reason I&#039;m on SR,&nbsp; because it offers me a place to get the meds that SHOULD BE LEGAL ANYWAY (its a fucking natural plant),&nbsp; if it wasn&#039;t for SR,&nbsp; I&#039;d be on fucking pills with crazy side effects while those piece of shit prescription companies profit off me.&nbsp; <br /><br />If everyone had a gun,&nbsp; not just in the USA but all over the world,&nbsp; I honestly believe that it would be like the wild west.&nbsp; Because whether anyone on here wants to admit it or not,&nbsp; but I&#039;d say more than 75% of the world is not intelligent which means they might not know right from wrong like someone with a clear mental state.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the end the reason I don&#039;t want to see guns on SR isn&#039;t because I don&#039;t believe in people owning them,&nbsp; I DO,&nbsp; I think everyone has a right to own them(that is mentally fit).&nbsp; But guns are the governments number one threat to power,&nbsp; not drugs,&nbsp; so when you start selling something that threatens &#039;&#039;big brother&#039;&#039; well you can bet your ass they will do their best to shut it down,&nbsp; and I&#039;m sure none of us here want SR shut down!&nbsp; Regardless of our opinions this is a very informative discussion,&nbsp; thanks to everyone who put in an intelligent opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Btw...if you have a working brain people,&nbsp; vote for Ron Paul!&nbsp;

				^ +1 for erko.<br /><br />I agree about many people not being responsible enough to own a gun and use it correctly, but that is a really hard argument to make. Who IS to say who&#039;s responsible enough? The government? You? Me? No fucking way.

				With changes being made to assist sellers in combating degenerate buyers, I will soon be listing firearms. Primarily small handguns. The logistics behind this are more complex than drugs, so there will be a significant premium over buying a firearm legally. For those whom there is no legal way, then this is the only way. This is THE most expensive way to buy a gun, so there is no reason to do it unless you absolutely have to. In some cases, maybe more than 100% premium will have to be added. But I know what I&#039;m doing and it will be untraceable. I will describe the details only to actual buyers via GPG on SR messaging. Unencrypted messages will be ignored for both of our safety.<br /><br />I&#039;m also working on high-velocity hardened steel AP Rifle Ammo, for those being assailed by degenerates wearing body armor. This doesn&#039;t work for handguns, despite what the propagandists might tell you... Handguns just don&#039;t develop the power to push an AP bullet hard enough to be useful. The &#039;argument&#039; that the FN FiveseveN is a &#039;cop killer&#039; or is &#039;armor piercing&#039; is a damn lie. Making a 9mm bullet out of steel definitely won&#039;t do the job either...<br /><br />Science, Math, and Common-Sense &gt; Propaganda, Agenda Politics, and dumbasses parroting the same.

What this enlightenment suggested was that reason would govern the behavior of humans for the purpose of giving individuals the innate ability to understand freedom in the face of monarchy (or any social oppressor). (I am keeping it simple due to this forum).&nbsp; <br /><br />With that said American zealots, puritans, and dogmatic Christian fools, preceded to move west with providential ambitions, thinking that was the essence of enlightenment to conquer land. They oppressed the indigenous population with a genocide (the American Holocaust at over 10 million lives), as they battled, in their words, the savages.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Blacks from Africa whose slave labor built America were continually repressed for their innate desire to experience freedom and enlightenment.&nbsp; Fast-forward a few years, (not many) and we see the Chinese who were enslaved to build the American railroads, this helped the oppressors move west. Fast forward a few more years, the Mexicans were killed for their land; followed by out of the way places such as Hawaii or the Philippines which were forced to be subjected to the white American experience of oppression. Fast forward a few more years, countries like Vietnam experienced the oppression of the white American experience also&nbsp; (think Vietnam war).&nbsp; Following history (and I am overlooking thousands of other terroristic activates by America), we see the terrorist behavior throughout Central and South America during the 1970 – 1990s.&nbsp; We see the lies that precede a genocide in the oppression found in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Palestine and the (Soon to be) next American war in Iran. <br /><br />While this was/is on going, the malefactors (American oppressors) targeted non-whites in the homeland of America with the prison industrial complex. Cops are instructed (implicitly and explicitly) to target Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, and non-whites for the purposes of filling prisons. <br /><br />So...Freddie, a typical white-boy with a dim view of the real world, go to school. You will never see oppression in your white world, white existence, or white understanding.&nbsp; Join the insurrection...kill a few cops...and work to change society for the better.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally Freddie...anyone, non-white or white who has seen, experienced in any way the &quot;American Dream&quot; or prison, abuse by cop, forced to fight an illegal war...knows oppression.

				Yeah there&#039;s always been a lot of romanticizing of America&#039;s beginnings, especially when it comes to government.&nbsp; A lot of the founding fathers were liars and crooks, and Americans didn&#039;t have any amount of freedom thanks to them.&nbsp; Yes they fought a foreign oppressor, but they fought so that they could become the oppressor.&nbsp; One of the reasons the revolution occurred was because of taxes.&nbsp; What was the first thing the American government did after coming to power?&nbsp; Create new taxes.&nbsp; They also refused to pay soldiers their promised wages, and even had the balls to seize their land after the soldiers couldn&#039;t pay.&nbsp; <br /><br />Freedom never came from those men.&nbsp; It came from those who truly represented the people.&nbsp; Remember the Whiskey Rebellion, or when Revolutionary veterans marched on the capitol and forced congress to flee for their lives?&nbsp; THOSE are the men we owe our thanks to, not to men like Washington, or that prick of a president that signed the Alien and Sedition Act.<br /><br />

				The only way you can &quot;promote equality&quot; is by recognizing that all men are born equal, having the same set of inalienable negative rights.&nbsp; Anything else outside of that draws lines and creates groups and pits one section of society against another.<br /><br />Killing ANYBODY is wrong unless your life is in danger - your right to your own life and body is sacred.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a cop or a kid or some manager at a fast food place.&nbsp; They all have the same inalienable rights you have.<br /><br />A lot of the modern day &quot;knowledge&quot; of the slave era in the US is pretty off-base.&nbsp; What you don&#039;t ever hear about anymore is that a huge portion of the slaves were actually &quot;indentured servants&quot; (look it up), and that over half of the blacks taken from africa (I have read some historic accounts of over 80%) were sold by conquering tribes to the European slave traders.&nbsp; Of course it is all wrong, but it just goes to show what man is capable of.&nbsp; I&#039;m an anarcho-capitalist, I KNOW there is a percentage of the population that is deranged, sociopathic, etc.<br /><br />But instead of trying to re-write human nature a realistic approach is necessary.&nbsp; Allowing people to exercise their right to protecting their property and body is one of those things - it is hardwired into human nature and nothing you or anyone else says is going to change that.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot less likely you will get into a career in bank robbery if every bank you try to rob is full of people who have guns and something to lose (no FDIC ) - from 1840 - 1892 there were only 12 bank robbery attempts in the &quot;Wild West&quot;.&nbsp; There are more bank robbery attempts in virtually any single state in the US in half a year.

				That may be but in some countries (mine) you still go to jail even if you are defending your own life or that of your family and use a firearm to do it (even if it&#039;s legal).&nbsp; A firearm registered in your own name could be nothing but your own.&nbsp; A firearm with no registration could belong to the person who attempted to do harm to me and mine, and I somehow got it away and shot him.<br /><br />Also by registering for anything you are consenting under statutory contract that you SHOULD be licensed/regulated/permittted or not to do anything by the state -i.e. that their right to decide supercedes your right to live peacefully.&nbsp; If I could go to Walmart and grab one without registering you bet your ass I would.&nbsp;

Governments monopolize power by keeping weapons out of the hands of persons or groups that they perceive as a threat. This community has the capacity to affect this balance (albeit on a small, personal scale). Buying drugs off the street is one thing - there&#039;s always a guy on the corner. But how many arms dealers do you know? I&#039;m not into violence man, and would never go looking for trouble. However, should a bad situation arise I want the capacity to protect me and mine - and I shouldn&#039;t have to ask permission.&nbsp; Just saying.

				Hey, wait,......we didn&#039;t just shoot those STRAIGHT up did we? Oh shit!<br />You&#039;d have to be in lower Manhattan or have the worst luck in the world to hit someone, or something in the air.<br />The same frequency with with people kill themselves or others cleaning their guns.......it happens.

To be honest, the real reason I didn&#039;t want you all to buy guns was so I could oppress you. I was also hoping to rob every one of you and possibly steal your wives and children. <br /><br />Maybe I should get my &quot;white&quot;, oppressive ass out of here seeing as I happened to start a debate where everyone on the opposing side either has or wants an illegal gun. Or I could just buy all... 2?.. of the guns for sale on SR and stomp all over everyone&#039;s freedom. Who needs freedom anyway? Would Gandhi or Nelson Mandela have been so damn special if they were free their whole lives? Didn&#039;t think so playa. A little oppression adds flavor to an otherwise free, boring, actionless life. If Martin Luther King King Jr. didn&#039;t have a battle to fight, would anyone know his name? Not unless you lived in Chester, Pennsylvania and went to see his sermons.<br /><br />Without an enemy, there is no fight. And without a fight, what&#039;s the point? As George Orwell said, &quot;Freedom is slavery.&quot; Therefore, I declare that anyone who is in favor of selling guns on the Silk Road is an advocate of slavery. This is a simple fact and is not up for debate, so don&#039;t even try.<br /><br />/thread<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I think the administration has been pretty clear that they follow the NAP and they allow items that do not violate this onto the site.<br /><br />It is not morally wrong to own an inanimate object whose creation did not violate someone&#039;s rights.&nbsp; It is not wrong to buy or sell an inanimate object.<br /><br />This is why guns and weapons are allowed, and child porn is not.&nbsp; But it&#039;s up to SR - it&#039;s his/their site, they can add to or takeaway from the list however they want.

				&nbsp;:D I for one would like to see a wider selection of guns and gun related gear. Like a GUN STORE or PAWN SHOP. They are full of different guns. I would like to see that variety here with an SR shady style to it. Say buy a gun, get a suppressor half off. Buy 2 sticks of dynamite get a detonator free. That would be cool.

				It&#039;s not about whether it&#039;s morally correct to have guns available on SR. It&#039;s about how that market puts SR at risk. Guns grab attention from LE more than anything else. DON&#039;T BUY OR SELL YOUR GUNS ON SR, IT&#039;S TOO HIGH RISK.
