				So it is looking like I will be having to resolve an order for the first time. There&#039;s 5 days left until auto-finalize, and the last two messages I&#039;ve sent to the vendor have not been responded to after I had been in communication with him since I placed the order. I was given the tracking number after a few days and after cris-crossing my state for about 10 days its been stuck at a sorting facility not near its destination or over 3 days. Refer to this thread ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186766.0 ) I posted in the Shipping section describing the situation and asking for advice from the community. Now I&#039;m just looking for advice on how to proceed here as I&#039;ve never had to resolve an order before and don&#039;t know the process. I remember reading the buyer guide when I first signed up but I don&#039;t remember if the process was explained in that. Thanks in advance everyone! <br /><br />musichighlife

				never had to resolve myself but the process should be straightforward. if tracking shows that the goods were never delivered you will likely get at least 50% refund

				Thanks. Luckily, the vendor sorted it out with the post office and the package arrived a day later. Big relief and even better to finally have the product.

				the whole thing sucks but the post office has been slightly unreliable lately.<br />i say ask for resolution because of the timeline then ask for a week delay to see <br />if package shows up. this will cover ur ass and make u look professional and thoughtful.<br /><br />in any case seek resolution - if it shows up u can always cancel.

				Nuggs.... did you even read the last message before you posted?<br /><br /><br /><br />Also to other buyers that read this post.....there is never a reason to go to resolution if the vendor gives you a DCN and it shows it is in a sort facility....this has nothing to do with the vendor.

There&#039;s only 35 minutes between hers and the previous one, happens easily when you are working on multiple tabs.

				Bascially, what I have learned as a vendor is that if a buyer complains through resolution then you will get a 50% or 100% refund no matter what. <br /><br />Resolution has never sided with me as a vendor, and I&#039;m in the top 8% with 100% feedback. Even if my DCN says the package arrived, the buyer will still get 50% off if he takes it to resolution.<br /><br />So you don&#039;t have anything to worry about.<br /><br />

I mean as a buyer that&#039;s good to know that the site protects us but I am surprised that us buyers always will get the benefit of the doubt. Hopefully I&#039;ll never have to go to resolution though, I&#039;ve staved it off so far.
