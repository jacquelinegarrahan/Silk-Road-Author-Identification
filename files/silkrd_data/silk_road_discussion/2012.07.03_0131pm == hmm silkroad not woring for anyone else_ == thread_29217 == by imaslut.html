				Yeah, I&#039;ve been connected since yesterday too.&nbsp; I wonder if they have a problem with users staying connected to the site for long periods of time.&nbsp; It took me SO long to get the whole TorBrowser things up and running, so I&#039;m damn well not shutting it down (I&#039;m sure I didn&#039;t configure it right, because if I close it, it &quot;disappears&quot; and I have to dig through my files to find it, and MAYBE it will open up).&nbsp; Sure hope I can check my order statuses soon.&nbsp; Sheesh!

				If you do stay connected tho make sure you change identity regularly. In some cases it helps with the problem loading page thing too

				Any other ideas bones? I&#039;ve tried&nbsp; all that and the usual logging off etc and even came back two days later and still nothing. Now I have an order that has now been automatically finalised and I have not received, and looks like I won&#039;t be anytime soon. So fkn frustrating everytime&nbsp; I try to log on there is always something new and fucked up with silk road preventing me.

				<br />Recently I couldn&#039;t connect to SR for 4-5 days&nbsp; :-\<br />Then someone on the forums (thanks again anonaddict!) said that if the time on your system is wrong, that could prevent you to access some .onion sites. Turns out, that was my problem. Hope it helps, good luck<br /><br />

				Another suggestion - are you using any ad blocking software?&nbsp; I was having trouble connecting to SR a few weeks ago, and it was the ad blocking software that I use (AdMuncher) that was the culprit.&nbsp; Their ad filters suddenly started blocking Tor sites one day.&nbsp; &nbsp;Disabling the app while I use Tor solved the problem.

				Thanks for the advice guys. It started working again today, still not sure why it keeps doing that but the time loading sounds very feasible I&#039;ll have a look, cheers.
