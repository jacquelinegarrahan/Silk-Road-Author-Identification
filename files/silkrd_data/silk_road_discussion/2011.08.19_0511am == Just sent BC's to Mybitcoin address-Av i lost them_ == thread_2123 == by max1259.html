				&nbsp;:( Basically i&#039;ve been away for a few weeks,away from the computer everything so i didn&#039;t know about MyBitcoin being hacked and closing down or anything,i was even surprised when i logged on to SR to find this had changed.Anyway,i saw something i wanted,transferred some BC&#039;s from the place where i buy em to Mybitcoin with the address they gave me when i started,obviously it says their gone from the trading place but im just wondering if their gone for good :&#039;( or they&#039;ll just sort of bounce back into my account at Britcoin? <br />&nbsp;It was only after id transferred them that i saw the bloody link about Mybitcoin,feel a right idiot now..Will MyBitcoin have shut down the addresses etc or what? I&#039;v put a claim in but that&#039;s only for the ones that were in weeks ago not what iv just sent,proper pissed off now.<br />&nbsp;Could use some advice one way or the other<br />Cheers

				This will be interesting, If they bounce back or returned to you, they should at least ask you for a bitcoin address to send to. (I dont know if you can send bitcoins to an address that it was sent from) but, if you don&#039;t see those btc again. It will bolster my theory that mybitcoin was a total scam and not a victim of being hacked.<br /><br />Keep us updated on those bitcoins. You should at least file a claim with them, to see if they show up. or look at the blockexplorer and follow them. This is interesting..
