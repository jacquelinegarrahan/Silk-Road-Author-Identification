				Just want to post a quick link to SR7 Instant Win - the Silk Road&#039;s first and only instant win game.<br /><br />Each ticket has a 1 in 16 chance at winning 2BTC. And we already paid out one winner yesterday (the first customer -- which means either I totally screwed up in the maths or I personally have a 15 of 16 chance of having shit luck).<br /><br />The win is instantly verifiable and cannot be cheated. Take a look at the listing:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/691fd1b781

				Thanks guys.<br /><br />All the lotto listings just seemed scammy (not saying they&#039;re scams, but if you can&#039;t verify that a winner really exists...).<br /><br />This method takes care of a few problems:<br />&nbsp;Instant results - who wants to wait weeks for 50 tickets to sell?<br />&nbsp;Random<br />&nbsp;Verifiable odds<br />&nbsp;Can go to dispute resolution if I don&#039;t pay a winner -- The transaction # is visible to SR admins, so is any BTC transfer I make in-system. So buyers can be assured they&#039;ll get payed without having to trust me.<br /><br />Because after all isn&#039;t that what this whole game (SR, that is) is premised upon? It works because we don&#039;t HAVE to trust each other. I think this Instant Win lotto fits in nicely :)

				LOL?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t pay 1 out of 16 you can just win 1 out of 16?&nbsp; You do realize that&#039;s the same exact thing right. It doesn&#039;t really matter regardless it&#039;s clear you know nothing about mathematics.<br /><br />I&#039;ve yet to see a transaction # that didn&#039;t have at least 3 digits and if you had half a brain you would know that the first digit in mine is irrelevant since every winning number ends in an odd number.<br />In the rare or (impossible?) case there is no numbers in the transaction # the player would be refunded.<br /><br />Again how do you dispute the claims that your lottery has a 69% roi and mine has an 86% roi.&nbsp; What would we need to see the bitcoin market go up too in order for your lottery to pay as well as mine?&nbsp; <br /><br />Furthermore why is it relevant what I say to grab attention?&nbsp; Have you ever heard or advertisement?&nbsp; Is everything what it seems at first look?&nbsp; NO.<br /><br />Is my lottery completely explained in the listing?&nbsp; Does it pay better than yours?&nbsp; Does it pay more often than yours? Does the person running it have a basic understanding of third grade mathematics?&nbsp; Yes<br /><br />

That&#039;s where your lotto runs different from eddies. If a buyer on your game comes in with 1 or 0 numbers for the transaction ID(not impossible) they never had a chance to win. That should either be an auto-refund, if you want your claimed statistics to be accurate, or... you need to change your numbers.<br /><br />Or maybe you already accounted for that? Math-friendly people, anyone want to check?
