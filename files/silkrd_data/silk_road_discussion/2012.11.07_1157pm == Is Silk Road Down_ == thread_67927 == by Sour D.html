				It is being up and down a lot recently, Silk Road is increasing exponentially and i believe you can&#039;t make a new account at the moment because there is so much traffic to the website. Just try to get on at off peak times or keep refreshing.

				There&#039;s something strange. I can connect to the SR forums and use it perfectly. No problems here.<br /><br />And I can connect to the SR but when I try to log in, it tries to &quot;connect&quot; for 2 minutes and the times out. Is there a problem with my log in? Because yesterday I was logged in when SR stopped responding so I couldn&#039;t log out. Or does anyone else have the same problem (connecting to SR log in fine, but not actually logging in)?

				I am having trouble connecting. They were doing some maintenance which was disabling new registrations the other day, so it is possible that it is &quot;down&quot; for such reasons. Just as likely is that the server is just swamped.<br /><br />The most likely possibility is a combination of the two. Some servers are down and others have to make up for it by trying to process the same amount of traffic as normal so connections are hard to get.<br /><br />But yes, it seems that connecting is not a possibility at the moment.<br /><br />- The Consultant

				Something happened this morning that shut the site down completely, was browsing fine then nothing. I&#039;m guessing a software or hardware update, that&#039;s the only thing that would shut it down this long. Would explain why there is so little info from the big guy.

				I&#039;m not entirely sure what the software stack of silkroad is, but i suspect its some sort of relational database with some scripting language.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have noticed that pages involving search are significantly slower than other pages.&nbsp; &nbsp;This should not be the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;Implementing a fulltext search engine will drastically improve performance and boost scalability VS a relational database on its own.(on the same set of hardware)&nbsp; <br /><br />Some suggestions for site scalability improvements:<br /><br />1. Run&nbsp; a denormalized fulltext search engine that pre-joins related sql tables together into one giant fulltext index. (sphinx, lucene)<br />&nbsp;- You can actually run a full search server on every webserver(I&#039;m assuming there is some sort of cluster in the web tier).&nbsp; &nbsp;Search queries per second will scale with addition of webservers<br /><br />2. Memcached for static pages.&nbsp; &nbsp;A server that may only be able to server up a 10s of database queries per second will be able to return 100s-1000s of memcache queries<br /><br />3. nginx for reverse proxying/clustering<br /><br />4. Non-relational DB for anything that isn&#039;t doesn&#039;t require safe transactions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Allows better geo-scalability with more advanced Geo-replication than SQL<br /><br />5.) Asynchronous master/slave replication for the rest of the data that needs to be queried, while possibly doing data partitioning on things like orders and users<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just thought I&#039;d add that I also cannot access it.<br /><br />My the cable internet is currently down as it is currently being upgraded to 100 MBit in my area (engineers taking their time), so I signed up to a 5 day BT Hot Spot account, so I can at least get a fast-ish wireless connection.<br /><br />I thought connecting through the hot spot may be the problem for some reason, so I tried to eradicate this by connecting to my work&#039;s VPN connection, remotely connected to my desktop and downloaded Tor from there to try and access it. Same problem. Other sites are fine though (hence me being able to access this forum).<br /><br />I made my first purchase from the market yesterday and the last time Tor worked for me the status was &#039;processing&#039;. I have no idea if I have to finalise it or what.<br /><br />Oh well, the waiting game continues...<br /><br />

				It hasn&#039;t been down this much since I&#039;ve been here, I think the site is overloaded with new users and broke down or something.&nbsp; Hopefully they are carrying out maintenance and will then close down registration for a while to prevent these issues in the near future while they improve the infrastructure.&nbsp; I was able to log on yesterday and finalize a few orders and such.&nbsp; I have a few more now I need to finalize so I hope it&#039;s back up soon.&nbsp; I doubt the vendors can log on either though so they&#039;re in the same boat.&nbsp; I&#039;m always prepared for the worst though I have backup sites and connections I will go back to using if SR goes down permanently, but they&#039;re not nearly as good as SR in terms of the overall quality of the service and the product range.

				It really feels like we are in some sort of bunker and in the outside world there is some sort of apocalpyse going on, and we are held in the darkness and not knowing if the evil busts through the doors or our people, telling it&#039;s safe to go outside again. Pretty theatrical I know.<br /><br />But let&#039;s see what has happened over the course of just one week.<br /><br />1. More than an usual amount of downtime<br />2. The vacation-mode glitch<br />3. Lots of vendors most recent packages never arriving (not _only_ high-risk countries but others aswell, I have noticed this unusual behavior when reading through many vendors&#039;s recent feedback)<br />4. All that stuff that happened to BitInstant, and other major Bitcoin-sites aswell earlier<br />5. The forum-ban glitch from yesterday<br />6. Now this.<br /><br />Think what you think but I am just glad I used all my bitcoin just few days ago and got my stuff shipped.

				It isn&#039;t &quot;normal maintenance&quot;, but outages have happened before, are happening now, and will happen again in the future. the important thing is to not panic. I am as paranoid as they come, but during site outages, it is best not to just get spooked. I trust they are working on the problems.

				Hello all,<br /><br />As a vendor I personally am not worried about individual customers not being able to Finalize etc...<br /><br />I would use this as a friendly reminder that encrypting your address at checkout is a really good idea. It gives peace of mind that in the worst case scenario all you have to lose is money. I have faith that this is just an outage, but I am also personally assured that all that is at stake for me personally is tens of thousands of dollars and not my name, address etc. which allows me to relax a little bit more...<br /><br />Now I&#039;m off to enjoy the guilt free outside time&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />jor<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You have to wonder: if they knew they were going to run into problems due to the growing user base then why were they not able to plan ahead a little better?<br /><br />Oh well maybe I&#039;m being unfair.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible they expected growth but underestimated how fast the new users would be streaming in.

				What would be super-awesome, and I think go a long way to help appease the uncertainty thats is being felt by some in the SR community, is a &quot;Silk Road Status&quot; thread, stickied to the top of the &quot;Silk Road discussion&quot; forum, which can be updated only by DPR or the SR admins, to _confirn_ the current state and availability of Silk Road (Up, Down for Maint, Expected back on line [ in x hours | TBA ] etc).<br /><br />Updated at the first sign of trouble, or else once or twice daily even if theres no SR trouble (so people can see the information is relatively current).&nbsp; &nbsp;Ofcourse, if the SR forums are down, then we wont be able to see the SR status updates, but SR forums seem to be pretty stable at the moment...<br /><br />- Z<br /><br />

				Ah, nice to know I wasn&#039;t the only one experiencing problems. This is a tad inconvenient as I was sent some bad doses and am trying to clear that up right now, but the best I suppose I can do is wait.<br /><br />Also, until I found this thread I had never even considered it a possibility that the authorities had seized the site; this sort of thing happens to me regularly, it was just when it didn&#039;t finally give way for like 2 days that I decided something was sketchy. DPR says it&#039;s just caused by explosive growth; do we really have any reason to assume the site is compromised? Don&#039;t you think the Gov&#039;t would rub it in our face with a big FBI stamp on the homepage rather than an connection timeout? <br /><br />I think we should just chill out until we get word from higher ups. ;-)

				Hope it&#039;s not down... but with the recent increase in media coverage, and a reddit post making the front page about SR the other day I&#039;m not all that surprised. Honestly, it might be time to limit new registrations (at least to a certain number per day) to avoid this in the future. Also might be a good idea to place people who have been inactive for say a month into a vacation mode, where it takes them logging in again to reactivate their account. <br /><br />Also, the SR is pretty vulnerable to a DDOS. There&#039;s nothing stopping people from making accounts, logging in and just hammering the server with a bot. It would take a decent number of people at it, but really not that hard to do since a captcha is the only thing standing in the way. <br /><br />Also keep in mind that the SR servers could very well be hosted in a similar way to TPB where a VPS company is running them unknowingly behind tons of encryption, and like TPB if said company ever decided it was a little too shady they could pull the plug. <br /><br />Wait patiently, the forum is still up, which means a lot and DPR almost never updates until they have taken some sort of action to correct the problem and in the past has always updated us once it&#039;s fixed.

				This is a rampant speculation, but it may be that SR is transitioning to a cloud-based design like Pirate Bay, to make it raid-proof.&nbsp; Essentially, Pirate Bay no longer exists as a discrete set of servers, all request to this website are farmed out to cloud servers throughout the world, and the owners of these cloud servers may not even now that they are hosting a part of pirate bay.<br /><br />If SR was doing this, they obviously would not want this information to be public knowledge.<br />
