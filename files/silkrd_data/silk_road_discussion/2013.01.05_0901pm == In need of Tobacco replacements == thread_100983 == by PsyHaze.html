				Hello everyone at SR,<br />First of all, I&#039;m sorry if I posted this in the wrong section, but it was the one that seemed most fit.<br />This is my first time here and after browsing a bit I think if anyone can help me with this, it&#039;s you guys.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing, I live in Europe, in a country that weed is scarce and hash is abundant, therefore, I usually smoke hash. Smoking it in joints, I have to add tobacco to it but I hate the fact that it&#039;s addictive (although in 3 years of casual smoking I never felt addicted) and also the smell/taste of it. So, does any of you know anything I could use that&#039;s less addictive in order to replace tobacco in joints? <br />I heard about Damiana but some people claim that it fucks up your liver and also can become addictive. Kinda lost in this subject...<br /><br />Thanks in advance

				I hope damiana doesn&#039;t ruin livers.&nbsp; I would a link to let me Google that for you, but maybe try sage or one of the other hundred plus smokeable herbs out there.&nbsp; Or Google.&nbsp; I will that marshmallow leaf smells like burnt hair and doesn&#039;t taste great.

The thing about the liver is that a well known Portuguese site about legal drugs included an article about Damiana where it says that people say that it&#039;s harmful for the liver, meaning that not even them know if it&#039;s true. That&#039;s why I&#039;m kind of scared, for a site that big to consider the rumors, it can be true...<br />I googled a lot in the past, simply remembered this issue today (thus this post). Back in that time I found damiana, raspberry leaves and other fruits&#039; leaves. I guess I&#039;ll try Damiana and then go to other leaves I can get, maybe sage as you suggested.<br /><br />Further suggestions, especially if they have been used by you guys, are appreciated :)

				Catnip would probably work, I believe it&#039;s just a form of mint leaves? Sounds pretty silly though - i wouldn&#039;t try.<br /><br />Could you not just use a pipe? Or just some really light tobacco on occasional use probably wouldn&#039;t do too much harm

				PsyHaze: Roast the tobacco - this removes most of the bad taste..<br />Either a cig over a lighter flame or in a pot on the stove (low heat - about 5 min).. just dont burn it..

Yeah, that&#039;s why I&#039;m having this issue.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=100983.msg706090#msg706090">Quote from: danewhite on January 06, 2013, 02:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PsyHaze: Roast the tobacco - this removes most of the bad taste..<br />Either a cig over a lighter flame or in a pot on the stove (low heat - about 5 min).. just dont burn it..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, I used to do that when I used cigs, but now I use rolling tobacco, much much cheaper... Still, I want to change since tobacco is really harmful and addictive. The taste became a secondary reason...

Also, I heard that it is really bad for your health, especially your brain, might be lies, but since on top of that, salvia is more expensive than tobacco, not an option for me.<br /><br />I do, but it&#039;s not advisable to buy things there, I&#039;ve tried some, but won&#039;t go there again, the owners of the shops around here add chemicals to every single &quot;legal&quot; drug, smoking blend, etc etc in order to give people addictions. Might sound paranoid but it appeared on the news after the rumors, therefore, it&#039;s probably not bs, not to mention the price of everything in there...<br /><br />Sorry to sound demanding, but none of the obvious options do it, that&#039;s why I need your help, to figure out a safe (and if possible, cheap) alternative for tobacco.

				There are a few tobacco free rolling mixes around, the most popular is Greengo<br />http://www.greengo.co.uk/Content/WhatIsGreengo.aspx<br />I can order some in, it costs £5.99 for 30g pouch, so its a similar price to rolling tobacco :)

				I don&#039;t think you have too much to worry about. I&#039;ve found that the addictive properties about tobacco are really more about the habits around cigarette smoking.
