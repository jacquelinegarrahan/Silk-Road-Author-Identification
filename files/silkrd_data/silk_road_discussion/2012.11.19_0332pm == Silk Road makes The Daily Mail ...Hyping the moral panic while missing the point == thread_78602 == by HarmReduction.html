				The eBay for drugs: &#039;Silk Road&#039; website allows UK drug users to buy cocaine and heroin by mail order from all over the world.<br /><br />Class A drugs are being delivered to homes across the UK by Royal Mail to customers who have bought them online like they were using Amazon or eBay, it has been revealed.<br />Ecstasy, heroin, cannabis and cocaine are all on offer on the website Silk Road, and users say it is ‘easier and safer’ than buying drugs from dealers on street corners.<br /><br />UK shoppers can choose their illegal drugs with the click of a mouse and then wait for a neatly packaged parcel, with drugs disguised inside, to fall through their letter box.<br />Silk Road is an illegal replica online marketplace like eBay, with buyers and sellers, dispute and resolution services and feedback ratings.<br /><br />The website is accessed via a programme called Tor which enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an &#039;onion&#039; system to make sure their IP address is always hidden from police.<br /><br />An investigation by an online computer security professor in America earlier this year estimated that Silk Road boasts an annual sales figure of £14million.<br />&nbsp;<br />One clubber from Brighton, Sussex said: ‘There’s a group of us in Brighton who always order stuff online, it’s safer than going out to some dodgy car park somewhere.<br />‘It’s just so much easier and I know the quality of the stuff I order isn’t going to be compromised.<br />‘If I am ordering one or two things in a package like this then it won’t get picked up by the postal guys.<br />‘I reckon if I started ordering loads of stuff though in massive quantities it would probably mean trouble.’<br />Drugs are bought with ‘Bitcoins’, an untraceable digital currency.<br /><br />A 30-year-old DJ from Hove, Sussex who did not want to be named said: ‘I was shocked at how easy it was at first.<br />‘I was used to having to call friends of friends to try and sort stuff out but now I just go online and wait.<br /><br />System: Users buy a currency called Bitcoins which are totally untraceable and can then purchase LSD tabs like these and then leave a review for the seller like on eBay or Amazon<br />‘There’s quite a decent community on there with some intelligent people, it’s not full of druggies like some people would think.<br />‘Why would I want to try and score from some dodgy dealer in a nightclub when I can just get it delivered to my doorstep? It’s a no-brainer.’<br /><br />Sussex Police said they were completely unaware of the practise and had ‘no intelligence’ on dealers using encrypted websites to supply illegal drugs by post.<br /><br />A spokeswoman said: ‘Sussex police welcomes any intelligence with regard to the supply of illicit drugs, which are a constant threat to our community, it’s a timely reminder that any drugs whether bought in person on the street or internet will come from dubious origin.’<br /><br />The Royal Mail said they never knowingly allowed illegal substances to be delivered by post, but refused to disclose the steps taken to prevent postal dealing.<br /><br />A spokesperson said: ‘For obvious reasons, we are not able to give any further details about our security measures as this would compromise our operations.’<br /><br />A spokesman from Brighton drug charity CRI said: ‘Traditionally the Class A drugs market in Brighton is based on face-face meetings and it’s fairly open but this news just adds another worrying dimension to that.<br />‘I would warn users of the website to really think about what you are doing.<br />‘You don’t know what it is you’re buying or what it’s been cut with.<br />‘It exposes people to a high level of risk.<br />‘We of course don’t advocate the purchase or use of drugs, but if you are going to then make sure it’s from a trusted source.<br />‘We will do our best work from Sussex Police and the health services to help raise awareness of this.’<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				ugh. The Daily Mail is such trash. What do they hope to accomplish with that article? I can only imagine the comments on it.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m very pleased that I&#039;ve never heard of scumbag users from SR going to LE and selling people out. :) Or even, half-brained people (not LE) trying to infiltrate and and relay info to LE.

				Just a quick quote I pulled from Yahoo answers about why drugs are illegal which I feel is relevant to the topic;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">drug prohibition is a very new thing, we have taken drugs for thousands of years. There is evidence of cannabis being cultivated for over 10,000 years. Even the bible mentioned bud, which has recently been removed from bibles...<br /><br />&#039;The Lord said unto me, &quot;I will take my rest and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches. (Is. 18:4-5)&#039;<br /><br />The British went to war twice with china to secure our supply of opium, for mr sherlock holmes, thats how we got hong kong tilll the early 90&#039;s.<br /><br />I did read alot of modern prohibition comes from two business men who demonised cannabis/hemp so they could get their new products onto the market, a rope maker and a newspaper magnet who used diffeent paper.<br /><br />anyway as history has shown us the drug policies dont work, they just make it worse...<br /><br />btw drugs arent bad you are brainwashed, its the law and the criminals that are bad. The law creates black markets for criminals to operate only answer LEGALISE.<br /><br />The illict drugs are not as dangerous as the legal drugs nor many of the prescription drugs o the market, in the UK 140,000 people die due too alcohol and tobacco about 3000-4000 (overestimated rough figure) die due to illegal ones, prescribed drugs are a big problem but i havet got any figures on them, also more people die from peanuts and horseriding in the UK compared to Ecstasy. We do have alot of drug usage(not abuse as that is a term governments use to describe any use but care and educated use of drugs isnt always abuse) in the UK It is estimated that 1 in 3 working adults use cannabis.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yep, I read the article.&nbsp; The usual shit but then the Daily Mail is an ass wipe.&nbsp; The only positive thing about the article was the user comments which were (surprisingly for Daily Mail readership) mainly pro legalisation in one form or another.&nbsp; All this sort of article does is advertise Silk Road to the masses.

				Sadly the Daily Mail has a bad habit of going on about something they disapprove of and launching campaigns to save us terrible citizens from ourselves. This article will go nicely with their campaign to censor the internet by making &quot;adult websites&quot; opt-in only. They probably don&#039;t even realise that the technology which allows SR to operate is the same as the technology which allows human rights activists in countries like China and Iran to connect to the outside world anonymously.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that any focus on SR use in the UK remains minimal and we don&#039;t end up in a situation like Australia where vendors are reluctant to sell due to an increase focus by customs agents. I do try to limit myself to UK vendors where possible - I think it looks less dodgy than if I was regularly receiving packages from all over the world.<br /><br />

				Weird it&#039;s the UK because this sounds very American, or at least the law enforcement quotes do. I guess most LE everywhere are just retarded - kind of comes with the territory that you think you&#039;re doing a good thing by putting hard working distributors and harmless recreational users behind bars. That &quot;get your drugs from a trusted source&quot; line was fucking classic. That&#039;s such a Bush thing to say. If Sussex is like the &quot;south&quot; of England, then say no more I get it. But if this is your average UK city then fuck you guys have it pretty bad.

Taking away safe ways to get to drugs. The problems are when it is on the street and illegal. <br /><br />Being Dutch I know many, many people (85% of my friends and family) never done any drugs at all, including weed. Here you can test your drugs, get information. I lived in several places and drug use always seem to be far more present there. <br />I can buy magic truffles (psilocybe) legally here. You have to be over 21 and you will get a folder with safe practices. Also the person in the store has lots of information and is willing to answer your questions. <br /><br />(Hopefully) making a point with this example with abortion:<br /><br />Research shows that where abortion is illegal, many women die. Because they do it, no matter what. In the countries where it is legal, it happens less and women almost always survive. <br /><br />You can&#039;t stop it, so please make it as safe as possible. People get harmed otherwise. And when it is really about helping people, why are they doing the opposite?<br /><br />

				You&#039;d be surprised, despite being in some fairly large media outlets, SR is not really all that well known.&nbsp; Many people don&#039;t find the news that interesting even if they do read about it.<br /><br />I can safely say that no one i&#039;ve ever talked to that&#039;s involved with drugs has heard of the SR.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t explain anything I just casually asked if they ever heard of it, and then said no more, but that&#039;s 100% of a fairly large number of drug users who don&#039;t even know about it.&nbsp; Let alone non-users who know even less about the means in which drugs are acquired.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t start worrying about it.

				This is more of a problem for the UK, America already has some of the biggest heroin,coke,pill ect markets. Plus the best Grown weed thanks to politicians who realize its more benificial to tax weed. I visit England alot, I have 3 cousins in London and I&#039;ve seen the drug market and the kids there don&#039;t use 65% pure heroin in they&#039;re teens or shoot roxys like in America. The coke is like 5% pure and the cops actually screened my hands with some device to see if I had coke residue? Meaning in the US LE is already tied up battling drug rings from south america ect, its just the norm to see everyone you went to school with end up a junkie these days as heroin is the easiest drug to obtain expessialy in jersey.
