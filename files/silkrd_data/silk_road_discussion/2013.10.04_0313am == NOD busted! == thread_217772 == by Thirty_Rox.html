				It seems like most vendors get busted for messing something up in real life.&nbsp; They brag about it, don&#039;t take proper precautions, or like NOD also deal offline.&nbsp; You have to be smart to survive in this game, its completely different than the streets.

				Fuck! That is sad. Poor Nod :(<br /><br />It seems like they waited till SR/DPR was taken down to also take down Nod. The timing is not a coincidence. <br />But you know.. I was thinking. This person, ALLEGEDLY Nod, it seems was surveilled with tracking devices the old fashioned way, and was recorded going to 38 post offices. So? Maybe this Sadler fellow enjoyed going to the post office. If I&#039;m reading correctly, nowhere does it say the fake-name registered UPS boxes were found to have anything illegal with them. So his confirmed crime is registering a few UPS boxes with fake IDs. His ALLEGED crime is being Nod, and that&#039;s because they have him going to dozens of PO&#039;s. Unless I&#039;m reading it wrong, none of &quot;Nod&quot;s packages had the return address of those UPS boxes, right? That would be a smoking gun.. which I don&#039;t see.<br /><br />I&#039;m not an attorney.. but, one could theorize that if there&#039;s no prints, no video/audio/data surveillance of him actually handling drugs and putting them into packages.. and (yes I know SR servers were imaged.. but I&#039;m sure he didn&#039;t discuss ANYTHING about his real identity without PGP... IF AT ALL), he might have some good legal angles here.<br /><br />Ah, I dunno.. maybe that&#039;s wishful thinking. Breaking Bad and Silk Road finales in the same week.. this is just depressing&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Ok. I&#039;m an idiot. Just watched the video news piece too. He received drugs @ those UPS boxes he had rented as well. <br /><br />Moral of the story for vendors.. don&#039;t receive anything ever? I know some vendors get mailed product and then re-sell that.. so that seems to be the weak link for Nod (and potentially other vendors).

You can be sure the packages the dropped in those post offices were gathered as evidence as well since this was an undercover op.<br /><br />All to save a couple bucks in case a package is returned to sender he reveals exactly where to find him.

				it could be that they tracked it to the post office and sat on the spot long enough to put it all together. And if he was going into the post office, there are cameras all over, so with a few people watching videos and looking at just a couple little things, they could figure it out.

				NOD ordering the ID&#039;s for Ulrbright... wtf. So NOD knew that Ulbright was DPR? Why else would a vendor like Nod waste his time/risk ordering ID&#039;s for SOMEONE ELSE unless that SOMEONE ELSE was the boss-man himself. And though he wouldn&#039;t have known the real name (Ulbright), he&#039;d still have had Ulbright/DPR&#039;s real picture in his possession. Didn&#039;t know DPR and NOD were such homeboys. Fuck.. this one really has my head scratching.<br />Why would he trust NOD to order those ID&#039;s for him? Even if he didn&#039;t say they were for him, he still would have asked NOD to plae the order with the picture provide. That enough would let NOD know that he very well might be holding THE DPR&#039;s real picture in his hands, AND have his delivery address in his possession. I&#039;m sure NOD is a standup guy.. but jesus.. wouldn&#039;t the man be tempted to potentially.. oh.. I don&#039;t know.. extort DPR for a billion bucks if he put 2+2 together?<br /><br />

				The part of the article where it mentions the fake IDs is talking about Ulbricht, not NOD. I got really excited for a second there, as reading about this whole thing has basically made me feel okay about breaking bad ending - and what a twist. Oh well.<br /><br />Someone on these boards was speculating about NOD being the cocaine smuggler-turned-hitman (i.e. undercover agent) of the criminal complaint. I can&#039;t remember their reasoning or if they had any evidence. I had never heard of NOD. He is the only vendor name I&#039;ve seen thrown out there for the coke smuggling UC, and now he&#039;s one of 2 vendors that have been arrested. Interesting. <br /><br />Not trying to spread FUD here, the above paragraph is virtually meaningless.

				I&#039;m curious if they caught the pack randomly and did follow-up investigation or if the FEDS ordered from Nod, had a dog smell the package, etc.&nbsp; It sounds like the former.&nbsp; The feds obviously had their dicks hard for busting DPR....that mattered more to them than anything else such.&nbsp; Good bragging rights.

Once someone else pointed out I was wrong, I realized I&#039;d made the wrong assumption (at least that&#039;s what I think).&nbsp; It makes much more sense that they were talking about DPR.
