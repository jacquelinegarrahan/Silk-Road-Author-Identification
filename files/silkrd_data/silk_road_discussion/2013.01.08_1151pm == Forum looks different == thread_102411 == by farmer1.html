To the responsible users. To the spammers, noobs, trolls, etc, I&#039;d straight out track them down and become a serial killer.<br />OP...oooh lightbulbs!? Were they shiny??? Perhaps they were testing something like wintermoon mentioned. Shame I didn&#039;t get to see it. You said you say some other changes? Like what?<br />I&#039;m a child when it comes to shiny stuff...Also I mainly posted because wintermoon mentioned fonts.<br />I&#039;ll be on the lookout for these possible forum changes.

It&#039;s under Profile &gt;&gt; Modify Profile &gt;&gt; Look and Layout. ::) As for OP q., no lightbulbs but &quot;New Posts&quot; replaced document pictures on left hand side, then went back to normal. I thought it was just slow connection. (Just figured out what WM&#039;s avatar is. I originally thought it was a blue easter egg lol ::) )<br /><br />[edit. Or maybe we don&#039;t have it lol. I&#039;m not reading posts clearly at the moment. (Tired.) ]
