				Just read the whole thing. Looks like he is doing ok, just needed some upgrades. Though not 100% yet on that. Some people received love letters.

				I doubt they are real love letters. Not to blasphem his name but Thurgood has required FE on his large orders for a long time now, claiming he has to cash out and go buy the bud then ship it out.....Now what if he got a ton of that money and then sent out fake love letters so he can get off with a couple thousand dollars without anyone thinking he intentionally scammed them.<br /><br />I could be wrong... I probably am... but it seems like the perfect scam to me as he could maintain his high reputation and keep receiving FE money orders. Who knows.

				I highly doubt he&#039;s sending out a bunch of registered letters, something you have to go in to the post office for, to scam, it&#039;d be an incredibly obvious way to get caught.&nbsp; Seems like a return address or identifying packaging got caught, or maybe just a dog was put in a processing warehouse a lot of his packages went through.<br /><br />He&#039;s dealing with it well.

				For those of you saying he is refunding the people who lost their mail: How? He states on his listings he does not have money upfront to purchase so he requires FE so that he can cash out and go purchase the bud and then send to people, hence his longer processing times. How is he going to refund people money he doesn&#039;t have? If he had extra money on hand he would not be needing to cash out to go buy the product and ship it. I would hate to say he&#039;s a scammer with no evidence, but the whole situation sounds sketchy. 5-6 customers all receiving love letters inside domestic USA lol? Sketchy situations like this need to be called out and discussed because the last thing we need is another Tony. MOST OF ALL - return addresses are not automatically scanned by a machine, so how would all these letters have been caught in his state of sending(the &#039;love letters&#039; came from his state&#039;). Second of all, love letters from domestic? Unheard of. Even if there was a tip of, love letters have only ever been heard of coming from customs. Insides the USA if your shit is busted you can AT LEAST expect a knock and talk.<br /><br />If it were me and I tried to do such a scam, which I never would, I would send out these fake love letters, communicate highly with the afflicted buyers, insist I can refund them or reship their order as soon as possible, but due to financial situation I cannot do it immediately. Communicate highly to maintain trust, and continue receiving finalized orders for another 5-10 days, easly getting away with $10,000-$40,000 in bitcoins depending on how much weight is moved in that time period. It could be carried out for as long as the situation can be maintained by the persons social skills.<br /><br />With that said, what is seeming to happen now would fit perfectly in the above described scenario. I would for the love of Bajesus hope this isn&#039;t the case, but vendors who require FE on so many orders will ALWAYS be open to this sort of scrutiny. Sorry Thurgood... no hard feelings.&nbsp;

Anyway, this means that the post office receives no money from the government with the exception of franking. Franking is the ability of congressmen to send out mail for free ( well its paid for by the government ). However, the congress still retains some control over the operations of the post office. Part of the reason there in the red is because of the ridiculous pension funding required by congress. <br /><br />I think I did read a post on these forums from someone working at a sorting facility and they said sometimes dogs come by for an inspection, but it is very rare.

				He&#039;s requiring users to FE for small amounts of bud? That&#039;s pretty sketchy. I&#039;m not going to say I think the LL are a scam (too silly), but it does seem like Thurgood doesn&#039;t really have his shit together. In this business it really doesn&#039;t take too long before you earn enough money to keep a stock going. Especially if you know you&#039;ll be moving it quickly. Just sounds sloppy. <br /><br />I hope Thurgood learns from his mistakes.

				Something seemed off about this guy from day 1.<br />IMO, at least.<br /><br />Glad I never bought from him.<br />That&#039;s not to say this is all his fault or any of his fault, actually.<br /><br />Best of luck to everyone who didn&#039;t get their packs.<br />Hopefully someone will get to the bottom of this.
