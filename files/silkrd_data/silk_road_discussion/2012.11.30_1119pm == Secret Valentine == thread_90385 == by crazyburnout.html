				okay i was reading through a thread here around a week or so ago and along in the conversation someone suggested doing a secret santa. i thought this was an absolutely beautiful idea and a great way to just show some friendliness and appreciation on the road here but i have not seen anybody mention it since. im not necessarily the sharpest tool in the shed so i dont really know of a great way we could do that safely but there are lots of smart people on here with great ideas. i would love to see some mods or members get involved in this and come up with a way for us all to do a secret santa this year safely. i would be more than happy to put up like 10 coins or something for this. but yeah i just wanted to bring it up since nobody has said anything since the thread someone randomly mentioned it in.<br /><br /><br />::::::::::okay since its too late to have a secret santa lets make it a secret valentines::::::::::

				Nice idea but an obvious flaw is sending your address to a random person.<br />Also most of the users of the forums are buyers not vendors so quality of shipping might be highly variable.<br /><br />I won&#039;t take part.

				I love this Idea!! Guys count me in if we can get it going. I will be here to assist anyway at all possible. I love it. Send small little treats to people of things they like. Of course nothing expensive but just a Gift for us from our SR family. Those of us who have been here and participate . Hell i started early just the other day i put up a thread so everyone could see i had a few bucks left over and the 1st person who msg me and truly needed it cause they were short could have it, but had to in return help someone else out in the future.

				12/09/12 REVISION&nbsp; This is the latest plan, from member Typtap<br /><br />Sign-Up Form:<br />Santa (or Valentine) ID# :: 19fv5o153n<br />Wish List :: Cannabis, LSD, NBOMe, Ketamine, DMT<br />International Orders? :: Yes/No<br />(If no) Country :: Canada<br />(If yes) Country Black List (don&#039;t want to receive from these countries) :: Netherlands<br /><br />Instead of pairing people, the coordinator could organize by wish list and then country, under the assumption that people with similar wishes know best how to fulfill each others&#039; wishes and people who receive from the same countries will more likely know the best vendors for each other, then set the list next to itself and shift by one. This accounts for odd-man-out.<br /><br />Upon receiving a pm with your assigned recipient and their wish list / country info, you would go out and look for the best things to get them from 3 or so vendors. Multiple vendors keeps the gift more of a surprise. Message the recipient with -every vendor you&#039;re considering- and wait for them to let you know which ones are okay and give you their address encrypted to -each one that is okay-. Then you go out and order from just one of them with the appropriate address block.<br /><br />If you are the recipient, I suggest putting a note in the encrypted block that says it&#039;s for a secret santa gift and should not exceed certain parameters, that way nobody orders some crazy large amount for someone that would make them uncomfortable.<br /><br />****<br /><br />12/03/12 REVISION&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep making revisions as the bugs are worked out<br /><br />What do you all think about this:<br /><br />- Somebody (shitwassocash?) volunteers to post a thread announcing Secret Santa rules, spending limits &amp; deadlines. Thread becomes the master list.<br />- Everyone who wants to participate sends a PM to the coordinator to get put on the list<br />- Coordinator makes master list of member names but keeps the list a secret - it will not be posted yet<br />- At the deadline, coordinator numbers the secret list and gives each participant a Santa #<br />- Coordinator sends each Santa their assigned Santa # by PM<br />- Each Santa makes a new user account w/ their assigned Santa #<br />- Coordinator holds random drawing and makes pairs of santas identified by number (coordinator draws our secret santa partner for us, essentially)<br />- Coordinator posts master list of Santa Pairs matching Santa 5 with Santa 14 or whatever. This way, only the coordinator knows who is who. <br />- Santa pairings can communicate on the thread or by PM using their new Santa # user accounts<br />- Pairs will confirm w/ coordinator that they have made contact &amp; are good to go.&nbsp; Deadline is needed so coordinator can re-match any members left without a response / partner<br />- Each member of the pair then shops for the other<br /><br />The address exchange &amp; vendor bit was sorted by typtap, I tweeked it a bit:<br /><br />- Each participant makes of list of three vendors where they would like their partner to shop<br />- Each participant encrypts their address block for each of the 3 vendors on their list. You will send three separate address blocks to your santa partner, your partner will not be able to see your addy, only the vendor will see your addy)<br />- Pairs exchanges lists of vendors &amp; include encrypted address blocks<br />- Pairs then shop, adding their partner&#039;s encrypted address information at check-out<br />- Pairs notify each other when packages arrive so each buyers can finalize <br /><br />Does this work??&nbsp; Is there enough time?

				This is such a fun idea.<br />Some things to think about, also, that people have mentioned:<br />What would the cut off/weeding out system be? Someone mentioned who would be able to participate? Would it be only highly regarded members on the forum? That would definitely exclude me haha&nbsp; :-\<br />Is there any way to show buyer stats and prove its your account? I don&#039;t know.. I am trying to think... Because I do not believe the number of forum posts makes a person trusting necessarily, but I&#039;m not sure of another way. <br /><br />Someone mentioned worldwide secret santa/whatever which could be fun, but maybe people could be split up into countries cause I know Australia is a little crazy with their customs. Actually, I guess you could order for them domestically now that I think about it but this would require knowing their country, which I guess isn&#039;t such a personal detail. I have come across some Australian vendors while perusing The Road so that would be okay, the ones that might be tricky would be some countries in Europe&nbsp; because there aren&#039;t many/any domestic for Poland,&nbsp; Czech, Belarus, etc.... But maybe customs isn&#039;t as strict for those borders because they&#039;re one big happy family? wishful thinking maybe<br /><br /><br />Also knowing their DOCs, or what &quot;genres&quot; of drugs they like (opiates, uppers, hallucinogens, weed, E, RC, etc.) would be good so you would know you are getting something they would use and be happy with. Like, ordering a hit of acid for someone in a bad place with horrible anxiety that&#039;s never tripped before might not be the best idea kind of thing.<br /><br />As for the odd man out, maybe someone would be willing to participate if there were an odd number of people, or in case someone dropped out? Like have some back up people just incase, if anyone isn&#039;t sure if they want to participate? Not sure if anyone would be into that position but just an idea.<br /><br />And a limit would be good, like my family does a secret santa thing and we have a $75 dollar limit, which takes some pressure off. Some of them spend over $75 which is fine cause they really can&#039;t help themselves, but they aren&#039;t &quot;supposed&quot; to.

That way no one cries&nbsp; ;)<br />And about DOC&#039;s.. I think that is super important for more than one reason. Say Santa 1 only really smokes a bit of herb and rolls for special occasions, and is matched with Santa 7 who is a strict cocaine user. 120-170 is quite a lot for a secret santa gift (shit I only buy my family 50$ gifts hahaha) and 20-30 for some herb or M is kinda low, so we&#039;d have to find a happy medium and few vendors who would be willing to custom order a few packages for specific amounts. Cause it&#039;s going to be bloody difficult to find a bag of grass and a note of C for 100.00 even.<br />I like this, but I would only be in if it was a reasonable limit.

				So, I&#039;m clearly both a little slow on the uptake and also getting used to this brave new world of accessible illicit substances, because it did not immediately occur to me that this version of &quot;secret santa&quot; would involve said illicit substances. This sounds dangerous and a little crazy. I think I love it.<br /><br />Seconding, however, national boundaries (as sad as that makes me) - or maybe as an option by participant choice - because otherwise this thing seems like a good way to send legal troubles to the nicest people on the Road.<br /><br />Genre of drug is also probably a wise thing to match or at least disclose, though that takes some of the crazy randomness out of it. (Seriously, do you guys realize this is the kind of thing that gets invented for newspaper scare stories? If people hear of it, it&#039;s going to seriously bake some noodles. It&#039;s &quot;gateway drug&quot; theory with a Spin The Bottle twist)<br /><br />Valentine&#039;s might work better given that we&#039;re into December and specifically because of the Christmas postal glut. I don&#039;t know where people stand on the glut&#039;s relation to risk (impossible to carry out inspections vs. more time spent in depots) but it seems doubtful that anyone&#039;s going to get prezzies before the big day unless this were to happen, like, now.<br /><br />This sounds like crazy fun times, though, so add me to the list of &quot;if you can figure out a safe way to do it, I may want in&quot;.<br /><br />

				If we can pull it together in time im for the secret santa..As others have said maybe we should just use this idea to plane ahead and work everything out to a T and get everything down on how were gonna do it..My left over school funds are late so its thrown a monkey wrench in my order&#039;s i had planned..I found a great new vendor with the Original stop sign 15mg Opana 2pack for a GREAT price, and i had intentions of getting those, ordering a couple 40mg OC original formula and a couple 10 packs of Xanax.. I had to go to the doc today and i get 300 10mg mehadone, 60 1mg xanax and 30 k2 dalaids and im on disablity due to a gunshot wound from years ago and i get to the counter to pay which i only pay 3 bucks a scrip they tell me my insurence is now out til the 1st of the year so i had to fork up my planned sr money t,o get my meds...SOOOO pissed,but at least i got my goodies..lol... If anyone is interested in methadone im thinking about started to sell them on the road but it would only be a couple times a mnth, i also get other goodies that would go up..Would 7bucks a done sound resonable?

This accounts for odd-man-out.<br /><br />Upon receiving a pm with your assigned recipient and their wish list / country info, you would go out and look for the best things to get them from 3 or so vendors. Multiple vendors keeps the gift more of a surprise.

Then you go out and order from just one of them with the appropriate address block.<br /><br />If you are the recipient, I suggest putting a note in the encrypted block that says it&#039;s for a secret santa gift and should not exceed certain parameters, that way nobody orders some crazy large amount for someone that would make them uncomfortable.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Typtap?&nbsp; Can I just say that I love you too??

				ok sounds interesting, What about Receiving unknown packages in mail? Basically you&#039;d be unaware of contents, that may not really be an issue. Feedback and Refunds could be a problem though Since the Giftee would have to tell the Santa that the Gift had/hadn&#039;t arrived. As most of us know, the word Quality is subjective to individual experience. Unless some type of new feedbacking system were involved I see this as a problem before launch. Or the contract to &quot;Buy In&quot; to this may have to remove your rights to Refunds.

Hopefully neither the seller nor the giftee would lie about any of that. And they could settle something if the seller is willing to work with this, and then inform the Santa of what is going on. This sounds like it could be a little complicated though, and not sure how many sellers are nice enough to be involved in something like this? Not that they aren&#039;t nice but some maybe aren&#039;t as community driven as others..

				Secret Santa is a great idea when trust isn&#039;t an issue. <br /><br />Here, trust is both an issue and a major concern. There is no trust and we all wish for total anonymity if possible. SS is a bad idea in the traditional sense.

				I thought trusted vendor cooperation was the topic, ones willing to work with us and/or check out the thread and see if they can contribute anything.<br />Most vendors are pretty trusted, aren&#039;t they? Except maybe the brand new ones and ones where their feedback says &quot;package never arrived&quot; over and over.<br />&nbsp;Personally, I was confused about the idea of getting vendors, then the resoultion idea came about and having the vendor make a number and keep track specially for this, so if something comes up they know who the heck they are talking to if someone out of the blue contacts them about an order they never placed. This would require a little extra effort on the vendor&#039;s side. This is why I asked about what vendors we&#039;d be working with, so if we are working with all vendors and some of them don&#039;t know or don&#039;t agree then how will this resolution issue be cleared? <br />I&#039;m a little foggy-headed at the moment so I may have missed something, I&#039;m sorry if I did.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />I think it&#039;s such a great thing this has turned into Secret Valentine because I am not getting any of my packages in normal time frames.

				@WinterMoon I definitely like what you got there. There are all sorts of ways to complicate and fuck this thing up. Nice and simple is where it&#039;s at. Three top vendors to choose from, no guesswork. They pass on an encrypted address using that seller&#039;s key. As long as nobody botches the PGP it should be all good.&nbsp; Assuming that most would have previously&nbsp; placed and encrypted successful orders with chosen sellers that rate should be low. This has already proven to be tricky to get off. The more complicated it gets the harder it will be. As this is the first time there will be lessons to be learned, but trying to over analyze this is bound to end up in a clusterfuck.

				Let&#039;s go ahead then with a simple version of the game:<br /><br />GETTING STARTED<br />&gt; We start a thread with rules, deadlines &amp; spending limits which also becomes the Master List <br />&gt; Everyone who wants to participate sends a PM to the game coordinator to get put on the List - Send your Forum Screen Name &amp; Primary Drug of Choice (DOC)<br />&gt; Coordinator makes Master List of member names organized by DOC. List is kept secret - it will not be posted yet<br />&gt; At the deadline, coordinator numbers the secret list and gives each participant a Valentine # <br />&gt; Coordinator sends each Valentine their assigned V# by PM<br />&gt; Each Valentine makes a New Forum User Account using their assigned Valentine #<br />&gt; Coordinator makes pairs of Valentines - by DOC where possible<br />&gt; Coordinator posts master list of Valentine Pairs matching V5 with V14 or whatever.Only coordinator knows screen names <br />&gt; Participants PM coordinator when they have made contact.&nbsp; Coordinator makes new pairs of those w/ no contact w/ partner<br /><br />PLAYING THE GAME<br />&gt; Each participant makes a list of their 3 favorite vendors or vendors they&#039;ve researched &amp; want to try. List will include encrypted address block for each vendor<br />&gt; Partners exchange lists <br />&gt; Partners shop &amp; select a gift from one of the vendors on their partner&#039;s list, entering their partner&#039;s encrypted addy at checkout<br />&gt; Partners PM coordinator to advise that gift has been purchased.&nbsp; Coordinator repairs again if needed so everyone gets a gift<br />&gt; Partners can communicate on the thread or by PM using their new Valentine User Accounts<br />&gt; Partners will confirm safe arrival of packages to each other so transactions can be finalized &amp; exchange feedback<br /><br />If this is okay, let&#039;s start talking about spending limits.&nbsp; <br /><br />Checked on shitwascash, last seen 12/7 - hope she comes back soon&nbsp; :)<br /><br />EDITED for clarity on 12/16<br /><br />

				Hey, that is a great wasy to work it out!&nbsp; I was worried about the whole &quot;give your address to a potential LEO, but the PGP encryption for 3 different vendors of your choice is a brilliant workaround!&nbsp; <br /><br />Now the only issue I can foresee would be people taking advantage of this system by signing up to do Secret Santa/Secret Valentines and not following through with buying a gift for the person they were given.<br /><br />It would be sad if someone participated and they never got a surprise.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also how would we know when to finalize the order and what type of feedback to leave for the vendor?&nbsp; If the order never arrives how do we go about messaging the vendor for resolution when we don&#039;t have all of the details, like the address?

For some of you, it may be too much: Too much worry, too much anxiety, too many unanswered questions &amp; too many what-ifs.&nbsp; If you are going to experience anxiety you should probably just forget about this game and not play, it&#039;s not worth it, okay?&nbsp; &nbsp; :) <br /><br /><br /><br />
