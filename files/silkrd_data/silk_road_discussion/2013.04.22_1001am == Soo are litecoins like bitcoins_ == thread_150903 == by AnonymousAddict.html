				Litecoin creates its blocks faster, it takes around 2.5min instead of the 10min that it takes for Bitcoin.<br />Which doesn&#039;t really matter for the speed of transactions as you just need to wait for more confirmations instead.<br />They used a different hashing algorithm so that it would only be feasible to mine with a CPU and to decentralize the mining.<br />However this has already been proven incorrect as you can already use a GPU for mining and apparently ASICs would be a possibility as well.<br />There will also be more litecoins in circulation than bitcoins, 84 million instead of the 21 million bitcoins.<br />I don&#039;t really see the value in it, it&#039;s just Bitcoin with some tweaks which don&#039;t seem to make much sense.<br />If you still want to buy litecoins though, then you can do so at https://www.btc-e.com.

				I think all digital currency is going to go through the roof!!<br />We are seeing business&#039;s now being offered the chance to sell services and <br />products with digital currency! It saves them money on bank charges.<br /><br />When you can actually buy things (which arent illegal) on big name websites,<br />Amazon etc etc. It will go massive.<br /><br />Wish I could afford to do some stock piling.

				Wouldn&#039;t that other site you need them for have this info in their forums? Just a odd thing to ask here given the other site has a vested interest in helping you with them...<br /><br />Seriously... don&#039;t want to start anything unnecessarily but it strikes me as strange to say the least.. I am sure though that you will find more people who know where to buy them in the forum of the site that uses them than you would here.... I&#039;d imagine anyway...

				They just weigh less, that&#039;s all.&nbsp; :-/<br /><br />Didn&#039;t they post they were taking them here by the end of the year ?&nbsp; I thought it was a legit thread anyway . . . <br />The shitty part for me is that you need two kinds of wallets.&nbsp; Keeping track of them is a pain. <br />But you can convert bitcoins to litecoins and vice versa at the site :&nbsp; https://btc-e.com/<br /><br />That&#039;s handy . .&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to find an exchange to buy them.&nbsp; Just swap &#039;em at that site.&nbsp; For a fee of course.&nbsp; Perhaps, handy for laundering and shuffling coins, I&#039;m no expert.&nbsp; <br /><br />I seen te litecoin value double or more in the last while.&nbsp; &nbsp;Always wondered if you could just switch coin types , every day to get he best rate or return. Like currency trading. Dunno.
