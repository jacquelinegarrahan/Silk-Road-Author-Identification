				You&#039;re not looking hard enough; your friends have friends, who have friends, who have friends. There is probably a dealer/user out there somewhere, try harder.

				Well I for one sympathize with you K Kosmos.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m also a bit too old (43) to be trolling universities looking for a hookup. The fact is that by my appearance, most people would think I&#039;m some kind of cop. I guess that&#039;s what SR is for though as it&#039;s completely anonymous for both the vendor and the buyer. Asking to meet a local dealer through SR is probably exactly what the real police would do so I doubt you (or I) are going to get very far in this pursuit. Hopefully one day weed won&#039;t be the illegal demon drug that society deems it to be and we&#039;ll be able to purchase freely and legally without worrying about who to trust. <br />Honestly though, wouldn&#039;t we all be better off if Law Enforcement diverted it&#039;s limited resources to more worthy &quot;bad things&quot;.&nbsp;

				You guys should check out local community or Tech schools.&nbsp; A lot of students are older, I had a 70 year old lady in my Psychology Class one semester at a Community College.&nbsp; Also the students tend to be either extreme party animals or very serious.&nbsp; Most people who go to Community College have had a harder life than most and are likely to use weed or other drugs.&nbsp; Just stay away from the really young ones, some of them are obnoxious straight laced High School students who are taking college classes to get ahead.&nbsp; They will run screaming to mommy and daddy if they get scared.<br /><br />Just go hang out in the smoking areas and chat with people, say you are checking out the school and going through the admissions process, blah blah.&nbsp; Mention that you feel a bit out of place cause you are older, be friendly.&nbsp; Talk about music, how bad the economy is, how expensive cigarettes are, whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp;You should find some stupid kids going on about parties and weed pretty easily.&nbsp; &nbsp;Go at around 12:30 pm or 9:30, right after classes when they are smoking.&nbsp; &nbsp;I overheard girl a who seemed high as a kite talking about taking X the night before just this Monday.&nbsp; I may approach her if&nbsp; I see her later but she gave me bad vibes....

Hit on the girls, hook up. Lots of college chicks like older men.<br /><br />Oh, wait you are talking about hooking up for drugs. Well after you bang the hell out of her comment &quot;Damn it would be nice if I had a joint right now.&quot; She will pick up the phone make a call and if you are lucky she will introduce you to her dealer. If not, she will pull a joint from her purse and share it with you.

				Just walk down the street. The first person to ask you for change can more than likely hook you up.
