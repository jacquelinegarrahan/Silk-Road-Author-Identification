				He just seems to have unrealistic expectations of what tracking will do. I don&#039;t have much experience with tracking but as far as I&#039;m aware it says &quot;your package is in transit&quot; until several days after its has been delivered when it changes to &quot;package was delivered on ...........&quot;. As I understood it, its purpose on here was mainly to prove the vendor has sent something and&nbsp; protect him from fraudulent claims.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This guy seems to think it will be &quot;heading down the runway&quot;<br />&quot;In flight over Atlantic&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Being unloaded at destination&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;In back of truck 1000 miles away&#039;.&nbsp; &#039;900 miles away&quot; &quot;800 miles away&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;700 miles away&quot;...............&quot;its nearly here, the postman is smoking a cigar, then he&#039;ll be on his way&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;He&#039;s three houses away&quot; &quot;this is him coming up the path&quot; &quot;YOUR PACKAGE HAS BEEEN DELIVERED&quot;

				You gave the tracking information. Yet he wants you to give him updates? You can check tracking every hour but won&#039;t say anything different. I usually just look to see when it shipped and when the expected delivery date is.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Did I read the part where he asks you to tell him how to tell who the box owner is right? How are you supposed to know that! It is the box he told you to ship to.<br /><br />Then it sounds like he worried his friend might have stolen it. Don&#039;t think that is your problem. You shipped to the address he gave you. <br />&nbsp;<br />I would point those out to Sr resolutions if it gets to that. I read it a few times and don&#039;t see anything you did wrong. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
