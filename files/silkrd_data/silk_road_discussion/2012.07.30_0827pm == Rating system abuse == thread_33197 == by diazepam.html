				OK, I have been using this forum a while, but created a new account as I want to be anonymous from my silk road name.<br /><br />I bought some stuff from here before and it was awesome every time.&nbsp; I bought some last week from someone else as my preferred seller had none.&nbsp; It was much cheaper, but the guy had good ratings.<br /><br />However, there was nothing in it...nothing at all.&nbsp; I was totally ripped off so amended my feedback (had finalized and given 5 as soon as it arrived).&nbsp; Now I have an inbox full of hassle from the seller......there is a bad tone to it, so I now feel compelled to change to high feedback as the guy has my address...... seems to defeat the whole point, but I can&#039;t be bothered with the hassle.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Before leaving bad fb you really should have contacted the seller about the issue. That being said, it is not ok to harass a customer. Have you responded and explained the situation? Did you give the seller a chance to resolve? Definitely do those things. Good sellers want happy customers and try to resolve issues like this.

				Sounds like the seller is trying to blackmail you. That can&#039;t be tolerated.<br /><br />If you really believe this to be the case, report him to the admins.<br /><br />BB

				What difference does it make if he has your address, is he gonna go to the local sheriffs office and turn you in? Dont give your exact real name and he doesnt have shit. Or use a po box.<br /><br />Anyways he didnt threaten you so chill the fuck out.
