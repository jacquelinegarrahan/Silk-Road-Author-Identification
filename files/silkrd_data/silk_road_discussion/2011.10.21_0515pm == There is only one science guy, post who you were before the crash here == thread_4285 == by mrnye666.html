				I have several accounts on this forum, all mrnye*(insert number here) Just to let you alll know I&#039;m not a shill or anything, just after this whole crash I haven&#039;t been able to logon to my original mrnye1 username. So to vendors&nbsp; that I&#039;ve messaged, mrnye1=mrnye1.1=mrnye666. Just clarifying. I think the same thing happened to a lot of users and I think we should have a thread to associate our new, working usernames, to our old inaccesible one. We can use this thread if everyone is cool with that.

				You should set up a PGP key which will do much more for maintaining and proving your identity than a thread like this. It&#039;s also handy to send sensitive information, like your home address, as an encrypted message.<br /><br />There&#039;s a step-by-step guide on the forum. I suggest you find and set one up so you can prove your identity. :)

Also is the PGP key thread still around? I know a lot of older thread took flight from the forum and never came back.

				You can sign your posts using your key and prove your identity. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of things you can do having posted your key in that thread; you may want to read up on all the benefits of it.

				Basically, if you encrypt something with your private key anyone with your public key can decrypt it. So to prove you are the same person that posted the public key, you encrypt some text with your private key and if your public key can decrypt it, they know you are the owner of the matching private key. If you want people to be able to verify you at a future point tell them to store your public key, then, no matter how you contact them, you can sign something with your private key and prove you are who you say you are.

Public keys are used for encrypting only, not decrypting.<br /><br />If you want to verify your identify (or, to be more precise, the fact that you are holding a particular private key) you can post with signed messages. Here is an example:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />I have been high the past 420 hours, including sleeping hours.<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQGcBAEBAgAGBQJOo0zEAAoJEIE8YuZd+4C3jh4L/AzlW6sKn0/vwcf1CB+FBDeq<br />bS1y5duwGAHEeYNwqtbNUwClU4Iv/J8x42Xtsgua/YEWNgAc7l2mklMpl3fnxA7U<br />Z7Wri+yxurobv9ARFODNpMt/5nnfHBmzszFYxF7d5a4eQET2vxKfc6NIvkrUl05w<br />Y0mvaO+aP8UKVUFaWokDHnFTxr+LXz+lfv4CZxiE/3L0QC0Mh9hVJHlllqMJapg0<br />URs2xH0C6VqdwOEW5qH4YZ8gFQN5T2++DOaXgv6P8f3URhUYyVKfkNk1HpJIL28c<br />YaDkNLE/4TEuJg7uXXceTjFVQxdngHVlyPwMrpvwg5VueQGjVvUlxeFANykhInsp<br />Jl079sKGkZ9MZ5lzaShf5QzDa3+Yr5DlCOhruSqcPd6ypAyc4moNXEDAx6W5bXxg<br />1ivwtHKTzzzY9Cd5Kg+CuPX6qMXDgJUOsxdYvKdaqCL78BrUTxBl8bu/lIzCJrOg<br />q9gZFNhjhV0emayxDYgKtDbpfhO4CHvNK0evK8SgOA==<br />=o/WC<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />If you have my public key (you can find it in the PGP key thread), you can verify that the above signature belongs to my public key. <br /><br />Encryption is of great benefit in our situation. Especially in scenarios where sites and forums go down. My advice is collect the public keys of all the people you trust, they may come to great use in the future.
