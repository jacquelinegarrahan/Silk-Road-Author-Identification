				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />First, I want to thank everyone for their kind words in relation to Ben&#039;s situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;There have been a LOT of people who have sent their condolences and I don&#039;t even know what&#039;s been sent to him directly.&nbsp; It does show that there are a lot of good hearted people on SR and that&#039;s something that I always thought anyway.&nbsp; This just goes to once again prove it. :)<br /><br />Ben needed a couple of extra days to deal with the legalities and we thought it just didn&#039;t make any sense to rush it when it was so important for the rest of what remains of his family and as executor he had to be there to iron out any issues so that&#039;s why we are starting shipping on Monday.<br /><br />This being the first time we&#039;d had a break since we started at Silk Road, it gave us both a chance to think about the business and what we were doing well and what we felt we still needed to improve.&nbsp; A lot of the following items have come from discussions Ben and I have had over the phone with an emphasis on two things: 1. how do we continue to offer excellent service to our regular customers while not stopping new buyers from using our service and 2. how to keep our pricing as low as possible and still make a decent profit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty much everything else contained in this post is aimed at accomplishing one or both of those goals.&nbsp; We never expected that the Silk Road would grow so big or so quickly and we simply haven&#039;t had the manpower to keep up with the explosive growth.&nbsp; I imagine many of the other higher volume vendors are feeling the same way and each of us will have to find their own ways to solve the associated challenges that come with this kind of tremendous growth.&nbsp; In any case, here&#039;s the news about our new items, operational changes, and upcoming events:<br /><br />1. 1mg xanax for $1 sale-I&#039;ve had more pm&#039;s about this one thing than any other (except when are we opening up again).&nbsp; What I realized is that the amount of merchandise we got for this sale is not nearly enough and if we were to have it with just what we have in stock the stock would be gone in a few hours.&nbsp; As it would turn out too, the supplier didn&#039;t have any large quantity to sell us either.&nbsp; So, we are going to put this off for 2-3 weeks until the supplier can provide us with enough inventory to make this a meaningful sale.&nbsp; In the meantime, we are going to list the item at it&#039;s regular price of $1.75 which still means that people can now get 2mg of great quality Xanax for $3.50 instead of $4.00.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is part of our previously introduced Maximum Value Pricing program where we are taking every item we have and trying to find either a way to buy the same item cheaper and then pass those savings along to you, the buyer, OR to find a comparable item (or even a better one in this case!) but that has a lower price.&nbsp; I think when people get these Xanax they&#039;ll agree with myself and a handful of customers that have talked to me already about having had this brand (Ksalol by Galenica) and every one has said that it&#039;s a great brand and very potent.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t had any for a few years so I had forgotten that they don&#039;t have any markings on them, they are just small light blue pills that look very much like a roxi 30mg but without the markings.&nbsp; &nbsp;I immediately realized that this might cause some troublemakers on the forums using fake accounts to try to say “Sure the xanax is only $1 it&#039;s homemade fake basement crap, don&#039;t buy it, you&#039;ll probably die from taking them” or something very similar. Haha! jk.&nbsp; But surely it would happen so I decided to send out samples to some of our customers and other people who are well known on the board and are very familiar with xanax&#039;s effects to judge it&#039;s potency.&nbsp; Some of you may remember that a certain buyer named Oxyhoot caused a “Pharmville is selling fake 2mg xanax” scare around 4 months ago, well, he&#039;s a good customer of ours today and he volunteered to be one of the guinea pigs to try out this new variety.&nbsp; We have around 10 other people but I&#039;d still like to have another 5-6 people so if you have bought xanax from us frequently and would like to receive a few free ones in the mail send a reply here to this thread (please DO NOT send a pm to our mailbox, I almost have it empty and if SR hadn&#039;t done maintenance last night I think I would have gotten done.&nbsp; That would only clog it up and I really don&#039;t want or need that as we prepare to reopen) and I will see who replies and contact a few of you and send them out.&nbsp; As the sale is 2-3 weeks away this will give everyone plenty of time to try them out and put their reviews up on a thread on the Forums.&nbsp; A buyer named Dirty Duke volunteered to start the thread, so just look for Dirty Dukes thread on the Pharmville 1mg xanax for $1.00 and you can read the reviews.&nbsp; I personally think they are actually stronger than the Psicofarma ones we had been selling and are pretty “wow” in potency.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that&#039;s only my opinion.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see what everyone else has to say.&nbsp; We will only be carrying these from now on so that represents a 14% price decrease from our current pricing and I hope that everyone is happy with that too.<br /><br />2. Stealth mode-does everyone know the old saying about “great minds think alike”?&nbsp; Well, just last Saturday I had proposed to DPR that he institute a third mode in addition to “active” and&nbsp; “on vacation” where customers who had bought from us before could still see our listings and make purchases but no new buyers could so that when we were overwhelmed with orders we could go into this mode and instead of shutting down completely, just service our regular (and I should say highly valued!) buyers.&nbsp; And then suddenly on Monday night, VIOLA!, I see that “stealth mode” has been added to the settings page and there&#039;s an explanation on the Forum for it.&nbsp; Well, I don&#039;t know if he was already working on it or he just took my idea and chugged Red Bull for 48 hours and coded it but Ben and I think it&#039;s a great idea and this will allow us to look at the orders in hand at night before we close shop and decide if there&#039;s so many that we better cut it off to new buyers so we can provide the 24 hour turnaround that we believe is so important to our regular buyers or that we still have plenty of capacity to handle more orders so we can leave it open overnight and service new buyers as well.&nbsp; It is our intention to stay in “active” mode as much as possible as we welcome new buyers and always want to service as many as we can.&nbsp; We&#039;ve recently had an opportunity to possibly get some more help too so if that happens then we&#039;ll have more capacity to ship as well.<br /><br />3. Listings going back up-we are going to put our listings up at noon on Saturday.&nbsp; That means people can order all day Saturday and Sunday and Ben and I will be doing nothing but packing orders all weekend so that hopefully we can ship every order on Monda,y no matter how many people order. Unless it&#039;s an avalanche, we won&#039;t be going into “stealth” mode, we will be open for all buyers.<br /><br />4. New items: when we open we will be listing Midazolam 15mg for $4.00/ea for a 10 pack, $3.75/ea on a 20 pack and $3.50/ea on a 50 pack.&nbsp; Then next week we will have two other new items:<br />Soma 350mg&nbsp; $2.50/ea for a 10 pack, $2.25/ea for a 20 pack and $2.00/ea for a 50 pack AND...<br />Ritalin 10mg (generic from Psicofarma, sold under the name Tradea in Mexico, I&#039;ve tried these myself and I will swear by them that they provide great focus without that speedy feeling) and the prices will be:<br />$3.00/ea for a 10 pack, $2.75/ea for a 20 pack and $2.50/ea for a 50 pack.<br /><br />5. For bulk buyers: we have great prices for buyers wanting large quantities and this is domestic stock so you don&#039;t have to worry about border crossings or getting some fake or weird who knows what stuff from India, Pakistan or wherever.&nbsp; And besides, do we really want to put our drug purchasing dollars in the hands of people who are possibly using that money to give to people who are going to use it to buy bullets to kill our American soldiers overseas?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about you, but that just doesn&#039;t feel right to me and it&#039;s another good reason to buy domestically.&nbsp; Get a great bulk price and stay safe all at the same time.<br /><br />6. Fent powder-there are samples going out this week.&nbsp; IF, and only IF, you are a regular and significant buyer of ours already and IF you are an adult experienced with hard core opiates of this nature, then you may be eligible for a free sample.&nbsp; Contact me by pm for an answer.&nbsp; There will be a small number of grams for sale soon and then a much larger amount around the end of March.&nbsp; The pricing will be $150/gram and this is made from 100% pure pharmaceutical fentanyl made in a big pharma (not saying which one, that would be detrimental to my supply!) laboratory.&nbsp; It is not basement cooked or whatever and it is obvious in the results. The mix is 10mg/990mg lactose per gram and compared to buying Duragesic patches or those lousy tabs or any other way, this is a super cheap way to get a good clean fentanyl high.&nbsp; There will be quantity discounts for resellers who want to sell locally to their friends and if your quantity is big enough you will get pricing that will knock you out of your socks.&nbsp; As you can imagine, the raw material is extremely expensive and then we have a PhD chemist with 20+ years experience mixing it so there are no “hot spots” or weak ones.&nbsp; This is the real deal folks and it&#039;s a great bargain if you&#039;re someone who likes fent and knows the proper use of it.&nbsp; I and I alone will decide if you are qualified to purchase it and I don&#039;t mean to sound like a pompous ass about it but it can be very dangerous in the wrong hands and I&#039;m not going to have an overdose on my conscience, even tangentially.<br /><br />7. Express shipments-and now for the bad news.&nbsp; Lately, it has been harder and harder for us to keep couriers to take our shipments to the Post Office as we&#039;ve had larger and larger amounts of packages for them each week.&nbsp; Since the Customer Appreciation sale the number has doubled and just stayed there.&nbsp; As a final straw, our #1 courier is getting married and moving out of state and our #2 courier is just now getting a full-time job in his highly desirable career field, so we have decided to discontinue Express shipments all together.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, this may not be as big a deal as it seems because for anyone who has read the upcoming budget for the USPS, you see that they are closing a massive number of sorting centers as part of the budget cuts and that means that another large portion of the USA is going to have only 2 day guaranteed delivery not 1 day and since Priority and Express packs travel on the same planes, it&#039;s just what happens to them once they hit the destination sorting center that is different and many Priority packs are delivered in 2 days already.&nbsp; We&#039;re sorry we have to make this change but security demands it and the loss of our two best couriers at the same time made his the right time to make this change.&nbsp; Stealth mode will allow us to control our order flow and Priority packs will always go out within 24 hours so there really shouldn&#039;t be much of a difference in delivery times on most orders.<br /><br />8. OC40 price reduction-we are almost finished vetting a supplier that will allow us to reduce our OC40 price by 15% starting with April 1.&nbsp; At a time when roxis are over $30 and all oxycodone products are either high in price already and/or going higher (except for our perc 5/325&#039;s which are already dirt cheap), we think this is a big deal and we are happy that we&#039;ll be able to offer this reduction.&nbsp; The OC80 will not be going down but we will be reducing the selling price so that it matches the OC40 cost per mg.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will be eliminating the discount packs BUT...there will be EXCELLENT bulk pricing for people who are buying true bulk quantities (5 or 10 pcs is not really a bulk purchase folks, I think we all know that :)&nbsp; If you are a releller who can buy 50 or 100 OC40&#039;s at a time, you need to pm me and get pricing but please wait until around March 20th to send those pm&#039;s so we&#039;re sure that the delivery system is in place and working and that the flow will make this item available 24/7/365.<br /><br />9. Using PGP on ort site-we do take using PGP very seriously as it greatly increases security both for you, the buyer and for us as the vendor.&nbsp; HOWEVER, we will never refuse your order because you haven&#039;t yet learned PGP.&nbsp; Please use the tutorials listed on our page or any of the fine ones posted in the “Security” section of the SR Forums.&nbsp; We still have 3 “workarounds” listed that you can use until you learn PGP.&nbsp; Also, if you spend a couple of hours with the tutorials and it&#039;s still all just a mystery to you, please just pay a tech guy type friend to help you and in about an hour he will be able to install PGP, generate your keypair , teach you how to use it and even send a few sample messages back and forth with you.&nbsp; There&#039;s no reason to make this into a big, troublesome problem and we will always be patient with you and help in any way we can so that you can learn to use PGP without it becoming a traumatic experience! :)<br /><br />Ok, that&#039;s about it, sorry for the extra long post but there were a lot of things to announce. :)&nbsp; We are changing our sellers page to reflect all the changes and update this to Pharmville 4.0, because during our break we have made numerous security upgrades, adopted the option of using ”stealth mode” so we can always offer our best buyers the turnaround time they expect and deserve and we&#039;ve made major headway in keeping prices down and introducing new items to the marketplace...and in that area all I can say is WATCH&nbsp; OUT! because we are going to be having a LOT more new items in the near future. :)<br /><br />As always, we truly appreciate your business and we look forward to doing an even better job for you during the rest of 2012.<br /><br />Have a great evening everybody,<br />&gt;Alex &amp; Ben&lt;

				I can vouch for Ksalol being great alprazolam.&nbsp; I used to get the 1mg blues in blister packs and have plenty of experience with them.&nbsp; They were popular when I lived in London, and I people loved them when I brought them back to the US with me.&nbsp; I&#039;m really glad to see a domestic seller with this brand. <br /><br />I totally understand why people might freak out seeing such a generic looking pill with no markings, but Galenika is a legit lab, and probably still my favorite xanax to this day.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Hey!<br /><br />Great to hear back from you guys.&nbsp; You&#039;re the best in communication as always, disregarding the much needed hiatus.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to see all the things you have in store for the future and I hope Ben is back in somewhat better spirits (as much as can be expected).&nbsp; Just wanted to let you know that you guys are one of (if not THE most) professional vendors here.&nbsp; I have no qualms, queries, or worries when ordering from you... so expect an order as soon as the listings go back up :).&nbsp; <br /><br />My condolences to both you Ben and Alex as you go forward and I hope you&#039;ve had the appropriate time to deal with your affairs.&nbsp; You guys are such a perfect model as a perfect vendor.&nbsp; Welcome back!<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for your &#039;official&#039; return and more in the future.&nbsp; Wishing you all the best and looking forward to a bright and prosperous future!&nbsp; Take care,<br /><br />DF

				There is only one negative thing about all of this:<br /><br />Now that you have diazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam in one place I may not give other vendors the business they deserve.&nbsp; In all seriousness, I would marry both of you and I&#039;m not even into men.&nbsp; <br /><br />The day you stock LSD...I can&#039;t even imagine the bad-assery of that concept.&nbsp;

On the streets 1mg xanax goes for 3-4 dollars a piece.. I would say 1 dollar for 1mg xanax is a good deal. If you can beat that price, I would say go for it. You obviously don&#039;t know what it takes to be a good vendor. The cost of packaging, stamps, the expense to drive to&nbsp; a far away post office.. Then all the grief of putting up with hard to deal with buyers.. Good luck charging 10 cents a piece and make a profit...

				Let&#039;s say someone buys 10 Xanax from you.&nbsp; You decide to only mark it up to $0.50, so you profit total $4.00.<br /><br />DCN + postage ~1.50, drops your profit to $2.50<br /><br />Then you have to drive the package to the post office, wear gloves to avoid fingerprints, buy envelopes, etc.<br /><br />That day you have a solid 10 customers, which nets you $25.<br /><br />Factor in gas prices to ship it out on time and the additional costs of gloves/envelopes/labels/stuff to pack it in as well as the occasional scammer who claims he never got it and then you have zero profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to mention you need to pay for a vendor account.<br /><br />$1 is not only a fair price, it&#039;s a deal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen people pay $5/bar on the streets ($2.50/1mg)<br /><br />What IS ridiculous is paying $1/mg for hydrocodone/oxycodone when you can get it far cheaper elsewhere.
