				there are literally at least two dozen pages of this same exact damn question. learn how to use the &quot;search&quot; function. it&#039;s there for a reason - to prevent questions that have been fucking answered from being asked over and over again. or go to the SECURITY forum and look there.

				more of a reason for you to explore first before posting right away. there are new people everyday, and sorry to sound like a dick, but if people didnt, this forum would be filled with the same exact question every other hour. read the sites wiki, use the search function, read the buyers guide - there are many many outlets for you to find information without having to start a new thread - and trust me, you will get the same response from most of the members here with questions like this. better get used to it and take advantage of all the tools and information offered.

				I suggest the BCking dude.<br />I used him and got my coins. It&#039;s more or less totally anonymous.<br />You go into a Bank of America location (even drive through)<br />Fill out a deposit slip and pay.<br /><br />It worked for me. Dunno if I would trust the guy with $600, but I did it for $40 and it worked out great.<br />also, he will send you some crappy PM about &quot;long live the king&quot; afterwards.
