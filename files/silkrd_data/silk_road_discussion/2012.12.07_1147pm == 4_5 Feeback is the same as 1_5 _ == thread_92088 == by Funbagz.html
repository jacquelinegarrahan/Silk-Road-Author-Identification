				When I used to work as a waiter in the restaurant industry, we used to have to talk to people about those little surveys which print out on their receipts. My bosses would instruct us to tell people that if they are considering ANY rating other than 7/7 then to just give a 1/7 because how the rating system works it will effect the overall Feedback the same way. Is this how it works on SR? If one were to leave a 4/5 simply cause the vendor didn&#039;t offer to wipe their ass for them, This still drops the seller&#039;s score the same way as a 1/5 does probably. Does anybody know about this?<br /><br />Bottom line. If your drugs arrived. You give 5/5. If the vendor made an attempt to resolve you give 5/5. I sometimes cant believe the stuff people say &quot;Left 4/5 because one of my pills was crushed during transit.&quot;<br />

				LOL Havacle y umad bro?<br /><br />Its true though. Anything less than 5/5 hurts the sellers score. And if you&#039;ve been leaving feedback like that before you&#039;ve contacted the seller for a resolution, you&#039;re getting talked about on vendor forums.

				I think one of the problems with feedback on SR is that positive feedback isn&#039;t that useful beyond a point but negative reviews can really make sales suffer for a vendor. There&#039;s a big difference between a bad vendor and someone who sends out pills that get broken in transit/minor complaints like that. This ain&#039;t Amazon.

				With a 92 being considered &quot;seedy&quot; - I give a 5/5 on EVERY order that I safely receive. Even if stealth needs improvement, then it&#039;s a lesson for the vendor - obviously I got my shit safely so I have nothing to complain about.<br /><br />I just hate seeing a 4/5 feedback &quot;cause the stealth was obvious&quot; - yeah if it&#039;s so obvious then why did your drugs not get seized?<br /><br />ALWAYS leave a 5/5 unless they ripped you off!

				At this point, the rating system might as well go from being 1-5 to simply &quot;thumbs up&quot; or &quot;thumbs down&quot; with commentary. <br /><br />Then display a trend graphic of&nbsp; the latest 10 thumbs next to the rating percent. That would make a buyer want to look at the feedback comments.&nbsp; <br /><br />For instance:<br /><br />BigBoySeller (98) DUUUUDUUUU<br /><br />(where D=thumbs down, U=Thumbs up)<br /><br />This would also minimize the chance that a buyer with unrealistic expectations would give a thumbs down for something like a broken pill or crushed bud or shroom caps not vacuum sealed. <br /><br />Ultimately what a buyer should care about is:<br /><br />1. package arrived. <br />2. received amount ordered.<br />3. What was ordered was what was ordered and not bunk or placebo.

				I want to give an example where a sub 5 rating is acceptable but not necessarily a 1..<br /><br />I ordered a sample and extended the auto-finalization by a week for the vendor, as he was very late to sending it. Turns out he never sent it and canceled the order a day before auto-finalization again, he ran me around in circles the whole time basically. I didn&#039;t lose any money and I can see why it wasn&#039;t worth his time, but the lack of proper communication both before and after the completed transaction made me knock his rating.

				I&#039;d like to see a system where you can leave an overall rating that contributes to their overall score and an optional additional breakdown of it, something like;<br /><br />Overall: 5<br />Delivery &amp; Packaging: 5<br />Communication: 4<br />Product As Described: 5<br /><br />That way you can critique a vendor without hurting their overall %

				Well I am in agreement with many of the things being said here. Yes for SURE! Use the feedback system when warranted. I don&#039;t feel it appropriate to give &quot;Constructive Criticism&quot; in his Feedback page. A private message would convey the message expressing service improvement suggestions. That&#039;s like if your wife or GF cooks you dinner and then after you eat you go on Facebook and say &quot;Hey thanks so much for making dinner for me, but next time can you cook it better?&quot;&nbsp; ROFL<br /><br />I believe that there are MANY buyers who have never been a drug dealer before. Among those people we have the types who believe that a customer not only has the right to complain, but has a MORAL OBLIGATION to do so. Same guy you&#039;ll see at McDonald&#039;s not getting a mistake replaced, but getting free food for which he didn&#039;t originally pay for.<br /><br />Don&#039;t involve yourself in the drug trade if you are looking for Amazon.com style customer service.

				I think some of the reasoning behind buyers being unreasonable is because vendors here charge top-dollar for their products. I&#039;m not complaining, I&#039;m just saying that there is a portion of the population that expects top-notch service since they are paying proportionately more. <br /><br />Personally, I have received every item I&#039;ve ordered, and what was expected came... so 5/5 across the board.

				I only have the balls to leave an honest review if I never intend to use that vendor again. I gave them my home address and they might be pissed that i didn&#039;t suck their dick for giving me average goods for top dollar. I do believe we should leave honest reviews, but it&#039;s just not possible if your next batch could be AIDS infected ground glass.<br /><br />If nobody actually uses the review system honestly then what good is it?

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;m pretty sure that the rating system works with this simple formula : <br /><br />Each rating from 1 to 5 get different percentage : <br />5 stars = 100% = 1<br />4 stars = 75%&nbsp; &nbsp;= 0.75<br />3 stars = 50%&nbsp; &nbsp;= 0.5<br />2 stars = 25%&nbsp; &nbsp;= 0.25<br />1 stars = 0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 0<br /><br />Let&#039;s call the Rating Percentage RP and each Total rating group will be called T&lt;&gt; :<br />Total 5 stars feedbacks = T5<br />Total 4 stars feedbacks = T4<br />Total 3 stars feedbacks = T3<br />Total 2 stars feedbacks = T2<br />Total 1 star feedbacks&nbsp; &nbsp;= T1<br />So the formula is like : <br />{ (T1 * RP1) + (T2 * RP2) + (T3 * RP3) + (T4 * RP4) + (T5 * RP5) }&nbsp; &nbsp;/&nbsp; TOTAL TRANSACTIONS&nbsp; =&nbsp; OVERALL RATING<br /><br />For Example :&nbsp; <br />A vendor has made a total of 40 transactions : <br />20 customers left 5 stars feedback.<br />20 customers left 3 stars feedback.<br />So : { (0 * 0) + (0 * 0.25) + (20 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.75) + (20 * 1) }&nbsp; /&nbsp; 40&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.75&nbsp; = 75% Positive Feedback.<br /><br /><br />A vendor has made a total of 500 transactions : <br />406 customers left 5 stars feedback.<br />72 customers left 4 stars feedback.<br />14 customers left 3 stars feedback.<br />5 customers left 2 stars feedback.<br />3 customers left 1 star feedback.<br />So : { (3 * 0) + (5 * 0.25) + (14 * 0.5) + (72 * 0.75) + (406 * 1) }&nbsp; /&nbsp; 500&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.936&nbsp; = 93.6% Positive Feedback.<br /><br /><br />A vendor has made a total of 115 transactions : <br />57 customers left 5 stars feedback.<br />57 customers left 4 stars feedback.<br />1 customer left 1 star feedback<br />So : { (1 * 0) + (0 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.5) + (57 * 0.75) + (57 * 1) }&nbsp; /&nbsp; 115&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.867&nbsp; = 86.7% Positive Feedback.<br /><br />If another customer made a transaction with that vendor and left 4 stars, so his feedback would change to:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { (1 * 0) + (0 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.5) + (58 * 0.75) + (57 * 1) }&nbsp; /&nbsp; 116&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.866&nbsp; = 86.6% Positive Feedback.<br /><br />If the customer would have left 1 star, then the vendor&#039;s feedback would change to:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ (2 * 0) + (0 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.5) + (57 * 0.75) + (57 * 1) }&nbsp; /&nbsp; 116&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.859&nbsp; = 85.9% Positive Feedback.<br /><br /><br />Briefly, every single feedback influences the vendor&#039;s total rating. Use it correctly.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				You all can rate as you see fit - BUT I had shipments dropping into NY/NJ during Super Storm Sandy<br /><br />There are always exceptions - I reshipped &amp; made good<br /><br />Should you encounter a local Hulk Hogan or mail sorter - or carrier -in your delivery zone - tuff <br /><br />sellers take blame? really<br /><br />think about it<br /><br />
