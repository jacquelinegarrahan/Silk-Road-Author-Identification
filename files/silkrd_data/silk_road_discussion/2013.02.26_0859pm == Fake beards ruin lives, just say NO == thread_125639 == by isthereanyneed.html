				I got a good beard supplier on line.&nbsp; Good shit.&nbsp; Made from the pubic hairs of young latino boys.&nbsp; Soft and full.&nbsp; <br /><br />You gotta watch purity though out there.&nbsp; Some people selling dog hair and snipping off their mom&#039;s pubic hairs while she sleeps at night and making these fake beards and selling them on SR.<br /><br />Fake beards.&nbsp; and of course you have to ask, why not just grow one. .. but you know ..&nbsp; some kids think this will pass for a grown up and buy beer or something?&nbsp; Maybe get laid from an old lady at the bar?<br /><br />I&#039;ll set up a vendor account and make fake beards from pubic hair.&nbsp; Should go over good.&nbsp; hehe

				Well, the good thing is..<br /><br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen anyone asking for FE for any fake beards.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen anyone offering re-ships either.<br /><br />We need more competition in that section.

				I never thought I&#039;d admit this. I&#039;ve tried to forget but for the sake of the youngsters I&#039;ll tell my little tale. <br /><br />I was young once. Innocent.

Hipsters.<br /><br />And it starts small. Like maybe a soul patch, or a goatee or something. Mutton chops. An ironic stache. Gateway hair.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you can guess the rest. It&#039;s all a bit of a blur to me.<br /><br />One morning I look in the mirror. Hair artfully dishevelled. A mix of last year&#039;s almost fashions and next year&#039;s retro-sclacker chic. And a full fucking beard.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even get it yet. I tug at the whiskers. Fond memories of the quality fake beards of my youth. &quot;No...&quot; I mumble. My voice rises to a scream as I realize the Shyamalanian twist. &quot;Noooo...!&quot; <br /><br />The beard was real.
