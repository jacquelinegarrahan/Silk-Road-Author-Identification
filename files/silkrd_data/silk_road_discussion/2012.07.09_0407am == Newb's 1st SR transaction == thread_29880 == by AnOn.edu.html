				Greetings SR&#039;ers!<br /><br />I wanted to share my early (and very recent) SR experiences as I&#039;ve seen a lot of posts by newbies who claim:<br />1. To have been ripped off<br />2. They&#039;re pissed because they&#039;re required to FE<br />3. They can&#039;t figure out how to get BitCoins<br />4. They don&#039;t trust this site or the vendors<br />5. They&#039;re scared about getting caught<br /><br />If you&#039;re new to the road and you&#039;re worried about any of these issues, relax!&nbsp; On my first SR order it took less than 2.5 days from when I had cash in my hand to when I received the products that I ordered.&nbsp; The vendors I dealt with didn&#039;t require me to FE, the products I received were EXACTLY as advertised and there is no way for the transactions to be traced back to me.&nbsp; My first order was in the last couple of months and I&#039;ve done a few more since then.<br /><br />Did I luck out? Am I a computer genius? Not at all! The wisdom and experience in these boards are amazing and you can find everything you need to know.&nbsp; While there are quite a few vendors who require newbies to FE there are also a lot who don&#039;t.&nbsp; Everything you need to get going on SR is right here, you just need to do a little basic research, that&#039;s it!&nbsp; I&#039;ve also noticed with the vendors that just being cool goes a long way.&nbsp; Say &quot;Thank you&quot;, make sure all communication is encrypted, and the big one - finalize your transaction AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THE GOODS.<br /><br />I&#039;m blown away by how cool and helpful so many people are here, and while there are definitely douche bags on the vendor side, I can&#039;t imagine how many there are on the buyers side.&nbsp; For the most part we&#039;re all just trying to make this thing work and if you do a few of the most basic things this place does indeed work and actually works incredibly well.<br /><br />Thanks to all of you who have gone before us FNG&#039;s.&nbsp;

				Did my first order last week, and my experience was pretty much the same as OP.&nbsp; A bit of research on these forums and elsewhere, and it was all straightforward (except for struggling with PGP for about an hour but that was me being a bit dopey). A few minutes of paranoia of course when the postman was late. All in all one of the best online shopping experiences I&#039;ve had.<br /><br />

				It is good to read these posts, i am sure that many 1st time buys go well its just that on the forums people mainly come here to bitch when something goes wrong or is &#039;too hard/complex&quot;.<br /><br />To guarantee a good experience in SR do some research and prepare to spend a little time setting up, after that it is simple.
