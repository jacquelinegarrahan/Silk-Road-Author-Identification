				Hi,<br /><br />Im in the process of starting selling on SR im totally new to tor&nbsp; ect so havn&#039;t yet got bitcoins set up to vendor account so i was thinking to save myself time when i get selling privileges am i still able to offer free samples to send out to prove i am genuine and also to hopefully get customers waiting ready for me when im set up? Or would this still be breaking rules as im not actually selling anything so there is no chance of me scamming.<br /><br />it would be samples of UK no.3 heroin posted UK domestic only for a start.<br /><br /><br />what is thoughts on this please.<br /><br />Also wasn&#039;t originally part of my plan for deep web but im going to also offer my Sports betting service which is actually genuine and profitable unlike most of the tipsters you see advertised in various places that never seem to have a winner once you join. Is there a section on the site i could offer membership to such a service?<br /><br /><br />many thanks<br /><br />Repentant1

				You can absolutely offer free samples with free shipping.&nbsp; Not against the vendor agreement!

				But your saying yu don&#039;t yet have a vendor permit? <br />You want to star giving out samples now.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s fishy dude. . Normally you would ask hem write a review and give good feedback in exchange for the&nbsp; samples .<br /><br />You are basically just giving away free drugs .&nbsp; <br /><br />I think you are pushing the limits though.&nbsp; I think you might fish for out of escrow deals after they take he first bait . You can&#039;t sell without a vendor permit.&nbsp; I would think&nbsp; that include marketing and advertising for a non existent business <br /><br />People don&#039;t have any way to warn others if you are good or bad.&nbsp; There is no vendor page yet. Why not just wait

				the reason i was asking&nbsp; is because i havnt got it all set up yet so i was asking for opinions on the matter rather than just coming out and offering, no intention of going against any rules and trying to get deals out of escrow.I understand the need to be suspicious ect so no worries ill just wait a few days till its all in order. Thanks for replies<br /><br />
