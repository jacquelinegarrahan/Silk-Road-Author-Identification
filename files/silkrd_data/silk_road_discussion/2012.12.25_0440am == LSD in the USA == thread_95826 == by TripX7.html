				Where is all the LSD! Where do people get this stuff from? Who&#039;s making it?<br /><br />I&#039;m a huge LSD advocate if you want to call it that. I think it&#039;s probably the most important chemical that exists. It&#039;s just so incredible. I just want to have it all the time and share it with everyone! But where do people get it from? The only reason I&#039;m here on SR getting psychedelics is because I don&#039;t know where else to get them. Timothy Leary called LSD the most important drug known to man, and I agree! This stuff can change the world, it&#039;s certainly changed mine. I NEED to find it.

				The best place to find a solid connect on LSD would be a festival/rave.&nbsp; Any place where like minded people hangout.&nbsp; Though I must warn of RC&#039;s being passed off as LSD but if you&#039;ve bought LSD off SR I&#039;m sure you wont have to much of a problem telling the difference.

IIt is my assumption that a lot of the quality LSD is coming from places like the netherlands and portugul because of their liberal drug policies. Like possesion 500ug not being a proscutable offence.
