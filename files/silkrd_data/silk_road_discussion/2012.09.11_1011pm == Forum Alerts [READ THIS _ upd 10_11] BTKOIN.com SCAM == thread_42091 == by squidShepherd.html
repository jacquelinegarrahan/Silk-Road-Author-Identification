				This thread is for anything going on in the forum that everyone should be aware of. If something hasn&#039;t been added to this post, feel free to reply and bring it up, when I come through the topic again I&#039;ll update it into here.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />ANTI-SCAMMING POWERS, ACTIVATE [REPORTING BTC SCAMMERS BEYOND SR]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: BlarghRawr</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For starters, go into BTkoin and pretend to make a purchase. Use paypal as your checkout then go until they give you the paypal account of this scammer. Report that account to paypal. (or hack it, what do I care?)<br /><br />Next, go to https://www.enzu.com/ and at the lower-right, use the &quot;leave a message&quot; to report btkoin as a scammer and for violation of the terms of service/AUP<br /><br />Thirdly, go to http://www.melbourneit.com and report the btkoin.com domain as being used for fraudulent/illegal activities.<br /><br />And whenever this shit starts up again, check for the new site on http://www.scamadviser.com to get the new details and report the site to the new hosting provider. I&#039;ve already done my part, guys. You want the forums to not be filled with this shit? Do your part.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />SNEAKY BANDITS! [FORUM ONLY VENDORS]<br /><br />If you see someone advertising on the forum without a link to their vendor account, ask that they provide one before you do -any- business with them, even &quot;free samples!&quot; Beyond the fact that vending without an account is against the rules, and the fact that you wouldn&#039;t have the protection of escrow, -anyone can offer free samples and collect a bunch of addresses before just disappearing-! Don&#039;t get harvested, only do business with legit vendors! Lots of exclamations to emphasize the import of the message here! Security is Priority #1!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />STICKY WIKI [FORUM CLEANUP]<br /><br />The Wiki is going to be updated to be more comprehensive and helpful to users as part of an initiative to clean up the forum to make it pretty and easier to navigate and more balanced for all of you. The information from a lot of old stickies will be organized and included in the wiki so that new members can be pointed to the wiki instead of to 20 different threads stuck to the top of every subforum.<br />The Rumor Mill in particular had a large number of stickies, making it difficult to access the individual vendor threads. These have been linked to in a single sticky now, so that the page is primarily floating (not sticky) threads. Same deal in the Security subforum.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />MT GIX, I4DOLLAR, BIT.LY, BTKOIN [SCAMMER]<br /><br />There has been a scammer making numerous accounts and posting on the forum with this thread title:<br />10 bitcoin=$79.99 [ www.mtgix.com ] trade in 5 minutes accept paypal and credit<br /><br />They have been mass private messaging users as well. Do not send them any money!<br /><br />They are now changing domains: i4dollar.com is one recent one. Also they are now using bit.ly -- bit.ly/SYT2KZ , and btkoin.com.<br /><br />Regardless of which domain/name they happen to be using, please do NOT give these people your money. No legitimate business operates in this manner. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------

				He/They will go away eventually. I am sure that even they can see &quot;0 views&quot; for all their spam. Eventually, they will realise that the effort is not worth the (no) returns, and they will stop.<br />All we have to do is continue spreading awareness about these dicks in the forums, especially to the newbs, so they don&#039;t get scammed.<br /><br />

Didnt want additional PM&#039;s claiming I play favorites around here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I can see how that could become a political issue! Seems like there should be some software based solution thing&nbsp; e.g. some manner of polling that determines &#039;stickyship&#039; but which limits the overall number of stickies so everything doesn&#039;t seem equally important (similar to the problem where students highlight their notes... except half the book becomes highlighted!). I was thinking something like color coding for each topic, where something like tony76&#039;s rumor thread would have become red, autostickied and bumped to the top of the sticky list once it had accumulated enough views + posts + poll votes = x where x is an importance weighting.<br /><br />Anyhow, I don&#039;t know how far the capabilities of the forum software can stretch, but it&#039;d be nice if the rumor mill had some different treatment to how stickies are created for the other boards.<br /><br />One idea (not telling people what to do, just brainstorming here) is the waterfall method where posts &#039;fall&#039; off the waterfall unless they get attention, this is the method used by the chans and it is quite successful. Maybe you could have a separate store, a black list and a grey list, where once a thread is filled with enough (polled) complaints about a vendor/member the ability to fill out a form becomes possible detailing the complaint and characteristics of the scam and the vendor&#039;s name + aliases are then filed away onto the black list (grey list for suspected but unsubstantiated claims?). Then a permanent store of scammers exists, but it&#039;s not hectares worth of duplicate complaint threads on SR servers forever, and also you get the relevance and immediacy of the waterfall method. Then &#039;interventions&#039; by moderators become very much rarer as the forum is able to regulate the rumor mill on automatic.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this is important enough to be implemented right away to be honest, but in the future it would be a nice upgrade to have this kind of capability stapled onto the forum. <br /><br />I mean, with tens of thousands of users the current system basically works, if a little creaky at times. But... once you get to millions of users and scale up, you&#039;ll need something more flexible, more automatic, otherwise the moderation team will number in the dozens, hundreds!

				My main forum account was banned permanently after replying to the BTKOIN.com thread.&nbsp; I called it out as a scam and I was instantly banned.&nbsp; I made this account and PM&#039;d Shai1973, but they never replied.<br /><br />To me, this proves either Shai1973 is in on the scam, or someone at the administrator level is a part of the scam.&nbsp; The account who made the post had only one post in their history, and no admin privileges.&nbsp; They couldn&#039;t have banned me.&nbsp; So, who banned me, and why didn&#039;t Shai1973 do anything about it?

				Call me stupid, but I ran into a service that claimed to mix-up bitcoins - Torwallet (http://nci2szjrwjqw2zbi.onion)... I&#039;m a whole bunch of bitcoins poorer for it.&nbsp; TOTAL SCAM.&nbsp; Once you send them your BTs you will never get them back. If you try to send them on to another address you get the following message: &quot;Hot wallet exhausted.
