				I had a few BTC left in my account and decided to order a couple of hits of Ecstasy for a German friend of mine (from a German vendor.)<br /><br />I explained the risks to him, he did his own research and said what the hell.<br /><br />My friend agreed to use his real name and address so I expected everything to go smoothly, but I FE&#039;d anyway without announcing my intention to do so, so if there were any complications resulting from the actual buyer being 1000 miles away, the vendor wouldn&#039;t be dragged into it. Seems fair.<br /><br />Anyway, the package took a week to arrive, but he got it. So we&#039;re both going to be rolling on NYE with our respective lady friends.<br /><br />Amazing times we&#039;re living in.

				Cool bro, glad he got his shit.&nbsp; My friend that lives a couple thousand miles away told me about sr and said he could get any kind of drug shipped to my doorstep.&nbsp; I thought he was full of shit and blew him off.&nbsp; Couple months later I seen that guy on youtube showing how he got his dmt through the mail.&nbsp; Did hours of research and here I am.

It pisses me off that I honestly don&#039;t remember exactly where I found out about SR. I know the Gawker article was the first long article I read about it but I can&#039;t remember what made me look it up in the first place. (I don&#039;t visit Gawker except through links.) Maybe something about TOR...<br /><br />But yeah, I&#039;m really glad his shit showed up. Not so much because I didn&#039;t want him/myself to get ripped off, but more because he would&#039;ve gone the rest of his life thinking SR was bullshit. But no, we&#039;ve got a convert.
