				Title: <strong>Experiences with SR Support?</strong><br />

				I&#039;ve been here on SR for more than a year and have been very lucky --&nbsp; no hassles or disputes and thus no need to call on SR support until now. But I was one of the folks who tried to withdraw coins yesterday only to have them disappear (at least temporarily). At the suggestion of a few folks here on the forum, I sent a message to SR support spelling out what happened and asking what if anything I might be able to do to fix the problem. It&#039;s only been a day, but to this point no one has even read the message I sent, much less responded.<br /><br />Have people that have had to call on SR support in the past generally found them to be helpful or responsive? Are they slow to respond but ultimately quite helpful? If a few days go by without any response -- does anyone have any advice about how best to follow up on an initial inquiry?<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anybody who can shed light on this.

				Within an hour of starting this thread, I am back to answer my own question. Once they read my message about the withdrawal problem, the SR support people got right back to me and fixed the problem -- restoring all of the &quot;disappeared&quot; funds back into my account. So it turns out that everyone preaching patience and assuring me that SR would make it good in the end were 100% right.

				I have had only good experiences with SR support.&nbsp; They get busy, so sometimes it takes a while to get info from them, but that always seem to work well with everyone.

				They&#039;ve always been helpful and they answers always within 24h. At least that&#039;s how it went with me.

				SR Support has always treated me well.<br />The vendors have too.<br />Once in a while a bad vendor comes through, and I&#039;ve watched SR Support take care.<br />As far as resolution, I&#039;ve always worked with the vendors, unless getting ripped off.<br />I have lost a few coins to scammers, but you get smarter each time.<br />I also use the support of the experienced forum members as well.

				I lost a withdrawal the other day also. It took about 24 hrs but they did respond to my message and sort it out. I am pleased with the service here.
