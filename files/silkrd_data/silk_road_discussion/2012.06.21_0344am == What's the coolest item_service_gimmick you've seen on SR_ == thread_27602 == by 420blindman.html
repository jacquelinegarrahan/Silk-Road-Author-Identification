				I&#039;m kinda new here (2 months) and have seen and tried a few things. I&#039;ve seen Limetless armored car, tried the coupons from PurpleLotus (worked like a champ, saved $132 first time out!). After using the coupons, I&#039;m wondering what else others might have tried or seen.<br /><br />Long live Silk Road!

				A user called Grix came on here a while back enquiring about interest in high-powered laser pointer kits. I checked out his website but am still hoping he sets up shop on SR, I like the security of escrow, especially when these things are WAY more powerful than what is legal in my country and although he reckons no problems with shipping, its a fair bit of&nbsp; bitcoin to lose if it is seized.

				its not melatonin its melanotan (afamelanotide). its a peptide you inject subcutaneously that mimcs how your body protects itself from excessive sun exposure. basically it gives you a legitimate tan (increases skin pigmentation) without the dangers of sun exposure. Very easy to find on the clearnet and a very useful drug
