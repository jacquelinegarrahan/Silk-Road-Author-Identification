				If you click on your &quot;account&quot; link at the top center of the silk road screen, it takes you to a screen that gives you your bitcoin account numbers and allows you to fund, withdraw or send money to your SR bitcoin wallet.&nbsp; If you look to the far right center on this screen there are a bunch of links under the &quot;Account Links&quot; heading.&nbsp; The bottom link is &quot;become a seller&quot;.&nbsp; Click that and follow the next screens, which will give you info on how to become a seller, including the &quot;seller&#039;s guide&quot;.&nbsp; Here is an independent link to the seller&#039;s guide:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/sellers_guide<br /><br />But you will need to use the set of links I gave you above to actually become a seller, and you will need around 37 bitcoins to do so. <br /><br />Regarding the speed, SR is a little slow, and sometimes more slow, depending on how many users are on.&nbsp; If it is taking many minutes to load pages you may consider modifying your tor connection to work with some different relays to speed things up, but if other pages are fast and SR is slow then its probably just load.&nbsp; Patience is a virtue.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
