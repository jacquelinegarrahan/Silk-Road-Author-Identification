And therein will be some option to sync to an Internet clock. For example: I&#039;m on Windows 7. There&#039;s a wee digital clock in my tray. I click on it, which brings up a calendar and the option to &quot;Change date and time settings...&quot; This brings up the &quot;Date and Time&quot; application window, which has a tab for &quot;Internet Time.&quot; It will say that &quot;This computer is set to automatically synchronize with &#039;subdomain.domain.TLD&#039;. However, sometimes these syncs are erroneous due to timeout errors or whatever, so if I&#039;m having trouble connecting to SR or if my laptop clock doesn&#039;t match my cell phone I go to &quot;Change settings,&quot; choose whatever reference, and hit &quot;Update Now.&quot; Sometimes the sync will timeout, so I move on to a different reference (some five are listed by default). I know on Linux (depending on distro) will be even more straightforward in this regard, if a GUI is being used at least, and will allow the option for adding custom references.<br /><br />2) I actually don&#039;t know why this works. But someone on the forums said it once and it seems to really work for me if connection problems are intractable. There&#039;s no point in doing it more than once per say 12 hours though, unlike how one would use &quot;Change Identity.&quot; Anyway I&#039;ve been connecting much more successfully and consistently since I started using this trick. I suspect it has something to do with using the system clock to calculate timeouts or sthg I dunno.

And therein will be some option to sync to an Internet clock. For example: I&#039;m on Windows 7. There&#039;s a wee digital clock in my tray. I click on it, which brings up a calendar and the option to &quot;Change date and time settings...&quot; This brings up the &quot;Date and Time&quot; application window, which has a tab for &quot;Internet Time.&quot; It will say that &quot;This computer is set to automatically synchronize with &#039;subdomain.domain.TLD&#039;. However, sometimes these syncs are erroneous due to timeout errors or whatever, so if I&#039;m having trouble connecting to SR or if my laptop clock doesn&#039;t match my cell phone I go to &quot;Change settings,&quot; choose whatever reference, and hit &quot;Update Now.&quot; Sometimes the sync will timeout, so I move on to a different reference (some five are listed by default). I know on Linux (depending on distro) will be even more straightforward in this regard, if a GUI is being used at least, and will allow the option for adding custom references.<br /><br />2) I actually don&#039;t know why this works. But someone on the forums said it once and it seems to really work for me if connection problems are intractable. There&#039;s no point in doing it more than once per say 12 hours though, unlike how one would use &quot;Change Identity.&quot; Anyway I&#039;ve been connecting much more successfully and consistently since I started using this trick. I suspect it has something to do with using the system clock to calculate timeouts or sthg I dunno.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great advice.. I learn something new on here everyday!
