In particular the FBI has located in a certain foreign country the server used to host the Silk Road&#039;s website. Persuant to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty request, an image of the Silk Road web server was made on or about July 23rd, 2013, and produced thereafter to the FBI.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />

				I think the image was made only for a month or so? The affidavit says about analyzing messages and transactions from May 23rd to July 24th...
