				I&#039;ve been wondering the same thing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a problem, and all of a sudden my last two orders never came after 14 + days ?&nbsp; These vendors were trustworthy and one vendor had actually sent me the same order in two different packages, one made the other did not?&nbsp; Time to move i guess.

				so how are we saying that the have the spots for the drops if we used PGP?? cause that doesnt make sense if you protected safe info how do they know to stop all packages or are you suggesting that the are changing their scrutiny process pulling more out?? im just a little confused to exactly why you think your orders have stopped coming

				Now, I know this sounds paranoid, and it&#039;s most likely a random problem with the mail, but I actually am missing 2 packages that should&#039;ve arrived this week. I have 50+ transactions on the road and I have never once even received a package more than a day later than expected. I received half of an order, in one box due to space limitations, on monday, it is now wednesday and the rest of the order still hasn&#039;t arrived. A completely different package from a different vendor was shipped out on monday, so this one is a little less strange, but again I received only one of two boxes that were part of the same order. Hopefully the 2nd box shows up tomorrow...I really hope the shipping was just staggered, but every other time I&#039;ve received both packages on the same day from this vendor. Both orders were for bulk, the first was for edibles however, which are generally pretty easy to stealth.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this is just coincidence, but it&#039;s good to share information so we can stay on top of things. Stay safe everyone.<br /><br />PGP was used.

				We too are missing 2 orders, both very late, from trusted domestic vendors, one wasn&#039;t marked for transit<br /><br />Maybe they had the vendors being watched and followed their drop off points, <br />&nbsp;this would explain how several of us, who quite possibly are scoring from the same domestic vendors, have had this happen to them, as ALL shipments &#039;might&#039; have been stopped at the PO!?<br /><br /><br />One idea that&#039;s tickling my brain is, think about it;&nbsp; &nbsp;The designers and technicians&nbsp; who &quot;built&quot; this wonderful web&nbsp; AND applications like ToR, are, as a whole, rebels, &#039;conservative rebels&#039; like Steve and Woz, and SO MANY BRILLIANT MINDS ... from Elite Coders and system analysts, to kids in their bedrooms (whose fathers ARE these guys, and who could code before they could walk!) <br /><br />&nbsp;People who KNOW enough to cause massive amounts of&nbsp; &#039;interruption&#039; if they so desired ..... however, due to the draconian laws being suggested, most of these &quot;conservative rebels&quot; chose to refrain from getting involved in the &#039;cyber brawling&#039;, aside from the ocaisional actions&nbsp; by gruops of people like &quot;Anonymous&quot;, all the way to&nbsp; the odd 16yo kid, (recently arrested in the UK) who ran the worlds biggest botnet!<br /><br />&nbsp; Me thinks the time has come where some of the truly great IT genii begin to dwcide &quot;enough IS enough&quot;&nbsp; and IF you guys REALLY want to &quot;play&quot; with&nbsp; OUR BABY. bring it fuckin ON!<br /><br />This could be one of the GREATEST &quot;in your face NSA&quot;&nbsp; trolls EVER!&nbsp; &nbsp; That camel watermark has esoteric implications I&#039;m sure!<br /><br /><br />Hopefully, the REAL &quot;original&quot;&nbsp; DPR will return with his crew of&nbsp; The E- L33T and change the rules of how this game is played<br /><br /><br />Just dreaming<br /><br />mighty morose maudlin motek .... maybe!&nbsp;

				My order from Monday arrived today. You guys seem to be freaking out over nothing, the server was not infiltrated, they simply made a copy of it in July.. So there&#039;s no feasible way they could have replaced every PGP message with a new delivery address.

				Ordered a decently large amount of mdma from cousin molly it was marked in transit on thursday around 8am, did my research vendor was legit5.0 with a shit ton of positive feed back, order comes yesterday (weds) with a 2 day sticker on it and its a bottle of glue and a mechanical pencil. (and yes i poured out the glue nothing was in there )<br /><br />I feel like I got ripped off,<br />The 2 day sticker thing makes me question a few far out possibilities, but I feel this is me just getting ripped off.<br /><br />This vendor isnt gonna be able to get my btc i dont think, I believe thats property of the DOJ now.<br />ugh this sucks for all those whove suffered a loss =(

				the question that remains to be asked is the following:<br /><br />has anyone ordered from a Non-US/Canada based vendor and successfully received your package? Are you in US/Canada or outside?<br /><br />I also had a package from Canada to EU which is is now 30 days in transit (this is from a vendor top vendor but who is known for having very slow shipping times, but I can assume it&#039;s been seized). First time this has happened too.

				Ordered LSD late Aug / early Sep, from Holland to a West-European country, arrived within the usual number of days no problem.<br />Ordered MDMA late Aug / early Sep, from east Europe, took it&#039;s time to arrive, but all orders from Haizenberg were taking a long time to arrive.<br />Ordered more MDMA mid-Sep, domestic, arrived promptly no problem.

The kids of the 80s-90s that pioneered the whole hacking/phreaking scene need to stop being complacent. <br /><br />Many of us are older now with families and careers (some of which aren&#039;t even IT related), but the spirit of the early internet lives on. The darknet is one of the last bastions of hope for privacy and anonymity in the face of ever increasing surveillance technology. This is &quot;echelon&quot; for real.<br /><br />Something needs to be done, and this isn&#039;t about selfish things like ordering dr00gz off the internet. The point is how successful and beneficial this place was, not just for the users but to society as a whole. Here you can at least be somewhat certain of the quality of your gear, and that you won&#039;t be robbed or mugged. SR even helped sick people get medicine that was regulated out of their reach for whatever reason.<br /><br />The complexity of SR was one of its greatest assets. Believe it or not, very few people know how to do these kinds of things, and few are willing to learn. This was essential to keeping the community limited to users that were at least somewhat intelligent and responsible. Sure, there were plenty of dumbasses, but the vast, vast majority of active SR users were remarkably competent when you consider the whole &quot;drug addict&quot; label that comes with the territory.<br /><br />As SR grew in popularity and DPR started giving out interviews, we all knew this day would come. Time to get out of denial and move on! What we need is a network of independent SR-like markets with escrow, as well as a several forums where reputation, product quality etc can be discussed. We also need to work on a new set of protocols, encryption algorithms, digital currencies, and communications best practices. Tor and bitcoin are all but compromised, and the algorithms behind PGP and full disk encryption are starting to show their age.

				Always used PGP. Priority shipping from DragonCove never arrived. Was supposedly sent 9 days ago. Always personal amounts (1 gram) and always arrived two days after marked in transit. He mysteriously had his account suspended at the end of last week. Perhaps he was busted or caught on the end was near and they didn&#039;t want him talking on here.

				I receieved a domestic order already in transit yesterday, low profile thing, just a white envelope... Have another thing that hopefully will show up. Fingers crossed. I had a about 4 grand in escrow and over 4 hundred in my SR that I just had the weird feeling to move offsite or cash out. Then I went to bed.... and woke up to this shit. Fuck the U.S. gov&#039;t what have they done for us lately other than slowly rattle the shackles of disregard amd oppression on EVERYONE. At least white folks were safe, no it your not the wheeling, dealing, and stealing (lawmaking) 1% then boy you better pony up for a tough life.

				Well I had an two orders I placed Sunday night. Both went in transit on regular mail Monday and Tuesday. I received one today and the other I&#039;m sure will arrive just fine tomorrow. I have never once used encryption as dumb as it may be but I&#039;m getting my shit just fine. In fact I was busted for selling shit awhile back and the cops know where I got it and I quit dealing and had charges dismissed due to the snitch not wanting to testify. They even know I get this shit and they still can&#039;t do anything. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT PERSONAL AMOUNTS PEOPLE!!!&nbsp; Worry if you are ordering half oz&#039;s or higher maybe, but otherwise fuck they only care about vendors. Good luck to all of you and fingers crossed for everything arriving in tact.

				I received an order today that was marked in transit on Monday... tbh I don&#039;t remember if I sent my address via PGP. I may have plaintexted it because the PGP client on my mac won&#039;t let me use keys without an encryption subkey, and there&#039;s a lot of vendors who don&#039;t have subkeys. I do know how to encrypt using the keys without subkeys now, but I guess I won&#039;t be using it too much any more...

				Seriously? I thought everyone was a little nutty around here before I got to this thread.<br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve read it, I know some of you are full-blown nuts. Yes, the USPS went out in full force to track down my order of 3 Adderall and a half ounce of weed (not what I ordered, but you get me?) and everyone else&#039;s orders. Are they going to intercept every package out of CA, OR, WA, and CO (the states where the vast majority of shit comes from)? How do you even think they know what to look for? I&#039;ve gotten fucking packages that I have no idea how they ever made it past inspection. The USPS is fucking gianormous. <br /><br />The ides that the US government is going to scour the ends of the earth to find every SR user as if they had some sort of personal axe to grind against us all is just a bit over the top. They&#039;ve already accomplished what they wanted (or they will have when they get Ulbricht to cop a plea deal).<br /><br />If you ordered more than a QP of weed or more that $2000 of any drug, then you you have reason to worry. <br /><br />I placed 2 orders over the weekend, one shipped Monday morning, the other following day. The first came Tuesday, the other hasn&#039;t arrived yet. The one that I got came of from less than 100 miles from my home. <br /><br />Just to stress the scale of USPS:<br />&quot;Size and Scope<br /><br />The United States Postal Service delivers more mail to more addresses in a larger geographical area than any other post in the world. The Postal Service delivers to more than 152 million homes, businesses and Post Office boxes in every state, city, town and borough in this country. <br /><br />By the Numbers <br /><br />65 billion — 2012 revenue, in dollars<br />160 billion — number of mailpieces processed<br />40 — percent of the world’s mail volume handled by the Postal Service <br />522,144 — number of career employees<br />39.7 million — number of address changes processed<br />246 million — dollar amount of online stamp and retail sales at usps.com<br />44.1 million — number of Click-N-Ship labels printed<br />483 million — total revenue, in dollars, from Click-N-Ship label purchases<br />83.8 million — number of packages picked up using Free Package Pickup<br />654,560 — number of new delivery points added to the network<br />0 — tax dollars received for operating the Postal Service&quot;<br /><br />Their volume might be declining, but (most of your) packages are needles in haystacks to them. I wish everyone not involved in high volume distribution/sales would take a Xanax (or 4) and relax! I understand why everyone&#039;s freaking, but come on!

				I had 5 orders in transit. Just got one today that was supposedly mailed out early on 9/22 but was postmarked for 9/30. Hopefully the other vendors weren&#039;t as slow and really shipped out when they said they did. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping everything arrives ok, I&#039;ll let you guys know what happens. 3 of them I wasn&#039;t really worried about but 2 were harder drugs so I had them sent to a drop address. Slightly nervous about that but honestly I don&#039;t even think one of them was shipped, it was a couple bags from DieselTherapy and from what I hear he&#039;s been really slow in shipping lately. Everyone update as much as they can, I&#039;m curious what will become of our orders now in the aftermath.

				3 drop houses all missed mail yesterday. 2 got mail today.<br /><br />Guys, I think the postal service is just hiccuping, coincidentally. <br /><br />The govt shuts down, the Road gets busted, DPR is on trial, mail is missing, some crazy unarmed cunt drove her car through a police barricade in front of the white house and was shot to death while she had a toddler in her car. <br /><br />It&#039;s just some kind of insane set of occurrences that happened within a day.

				5 mins, if that.<br /><br />I&#039;m only worried because they said that they bought 1700$ worth of dope in the NY area and several of the H vendors in that area disappeared over the weekend. Before this whole shit even happened someone was conjecturing that one of the main ones got busted on the way to the post office - if he did then they wouldn&#039;t even have to track shit down, it would be all in their hands.

With the exception of the inciident in MD, the charges were all filed there. The SDNY is only half of NYC (Manhattan and Bronx) and a few upstate counties. The rest of NYC is the Eastern District. And New Jersey is it&#039;s own district. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard of any arrests in NJ, but that doesn&#039;t mean it didn&#039;t happen.

				I&#039;m a little concerned on my end as well.&nbsp; If anyone has had recent contact with SunWu, I would appreciate a heads up.&nbsp; I was a very loyal and repeat customer, spending around $10k on product and being very satisfied.&nbsp; He was always polite, accommodating, willing to answer any or all questions, and always making a lost shipment right by agreeing to reship right away.&nbsp; Around 12 days before the seizure of SR, SunWu had like an absence of 10 days, which worried all of his loyal and repeat customers.&nbsp; He finally made his &quot;comeback&quot; about 2 days before the takedown.&nbsp; He relisted his products about 24 hours prior to seizure.&nbsp; When he finally came back he was in agreement with me about resending 2 grams of HCL.&nbsp; I sent over the details again and he said he would send it right out, but this was right up against the clock in terms of the seizure and I doubt it really was sent out.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he&#039;s freaking out about all of these sudden events, as he hasn&#039;t been on these forums since the morning of the 2nd; and reading a couple of his posts belays zero panic on his end.&nbsp; He is now MIA and so are his close associates (various distributors) such as WuSun (UK shipper) and others...&nbsp; I have tried to locate any trace of him or someone who may know how to get in contact with him through other means, all to no avail.&nbsp; So far I have been successful in having about 10 people PM me in the same shape I&#039;m in, begging for any source of communication with SunWu or his close operatives and asking if I do infact get into contact with him if I wouldn&#039;t mind sharing how, all of these people promise they will do the same for me if they get in contact with him first.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a small community of fentanyl connoisseurs who are going to be in bad shape if they cannot continue to get a source of their much treasured product.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing this may be due to SW, and his close associates (his various distributors), laying low in light of all that&#039;s gone on.&nbsp; He may be worried about continuing business in light of all the news.&nbsp; Regardless, his loyal and repeat customers are left in cracks and shadows and are suffering from withdrawl and other problems.&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to think he would just abandon us, but his sense of self-preservation is probably priority over our issues.&nbsp; If this means that he is just laying low to come back to us, then it&#039;s all for the best.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, none of this is any of our fault, especially a great vendor like SunWu; and I&#039;m sure just like all of us, he was in total shock and didn&#039;t see this coming.&nbsp; So he may be paranoid or worried about his own safety; this is just an assumption on my end, but it gets more validation each and every day that I don&#039;t hear any news regarding him or his business associates.&nbsp; I just want my damn fentanyl that I ordered during those last few days as well, =P, and of course I&#039;m suffering for that...&nbsp; This is not the fault of SunWu of course and is just a tragedy on so many ends for so many people who have lost their bitcoins that happened to be on sr or lost their entire customer base, or people like me who have lost their source of supply for personal use and needs.<br /><br />Everyone please hang in there and try not to lose out on hope.<br /><br />-Trocar<br />trocar@safe-mail.net

				I think most should be OK as long as you&#039;ve used proper encryption.&nbsp; Personally I placed two orders Tuesday evening. I thought there would be no chance of either showing since that was the night DPR was arrested and the following morning the site was seized.&nbsp; To my amazement one of the packages arrived today. I&#039;m not sure exactly what time the site was shut down but the vendor had to have processed it shortly after I ordered. There just couldn&#039;t have been a much bigger window of time to do so. Both orders were small amounts and domestic. I also used PGP and in the two years I&#039;ve been here I&#039;ve never given any personal info without PGP. <br /><br />Bottom line is I don&#039;t think there is much to worry about as long as you encrypted all personal info and not been careless otherwise. My big concern was how would they handle pending orders and mine arriving today is encouraging. Again, it&#039;s a small order, I would think large orders may still be a concern, but this definitely is a good sign. <br /><br />On a side note if you are the vendor of that 3-pack(you know who you are and so do I) please contact me so we can work something out.&nbsp; All I have is your PGP key and no working contact info, unfortunately the feds have your money but I don&#039;t roll like that and would to pay for what I received.

But I was ordering over the weekend and wanted to buy from a vendor that didn&#039;t have a PGP key on his page. I messaged him and asked for his key, and he said &quot;I don&#039;t believe in using PGP because I firmly believe in the strength of SR.&quot; I was like oh OK, thanks anyway! If he wasn&#039;t LE (which I doubt, because he was selling very small quantities), I feel sorry for that vendor!<br /><br />So then I try to order from another vendor, and this one says they can&#039;t decrypt my PGP. I send them a new one, and they still can&#039;t decrypt. They send me alternate key, and STILL can&#039;t decrypt the damn message. Then they write to me and say &quot;why don&#039;t you just PM me your address in plain text?&quot; I&#039;m like are you fucking nuts? I finally suggested that it was probably extra spaces in the message when they pasted it were probably causing the error and voila! That was 3 days before the site got shut down. I&#039;m glad I wasn&#039;t overconfident and didn&#039;t fuck up with that.

How&#039;d you find out post-shudown that he wasn&#039;t able to ship orders after 3PM? He only dropped orders at the PO once a day, so that was what the cut-off time was all about, but that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean he didn&#039;t package your order/print the label. <br /><br />That said, you&#039;re probably not going to get it. Even if he did prepare your order, I doubt that he sent out orders after he figured out the site was taken down since he&#039;d have known he had no way of getting paid. If it makes you feel any better (it probably won&#039;t), HF was a very high volume seller and he probably got fucked out of 10 times as much money as you did. None of the vendors who had orders in transit when the site was shutdown&nbsp; got paid for their orders. Vendors lost a lot more than buyers. I know it sucks, but just about everybody got fucked over.<br /><br />The one thing that&#039;s troublesome about HF is that, at one point, he was storing addresses. I went to place an order one day and he&#039;d updated his vendor page to say that he was storing addresses on a&nbsp; thumb drive with strong encryption and that repeat buyers wouldn&#039;t need to put their addresses in the shipping information. It said that repeat buyers could just write something like repeat customer or on file in the address field. He said that PGP was too much of a PITA and that it slowed down processing times.<br /><br />That spooked me big time. Apparently a lot of us reported him because within 3-4 days, he removed that from his profile. But it makes me wonder, did he just tell SR support that he&#039;d stop doing it and continue to save addresses on the sly? And did any other vendors do the same (for whatever reason)?<br /><br />That shit worries me a fuck of a lot more than orders that were in transit!

				What is to say that the government did not take control of this site and forcably take control of all if not some of the vendor accounts and allow more people to place orders to catch additional people. I may be way off on this but who knows when they gained control of the site and what they did with that control before shutting it down. Once that trigger was pulled the word was out. I only learned of the bust by watching the news as I have not ordered anything in a long time. I&#039;m also wondering how long before this forum is shut down and who is left controlling it now. So much unknown it is scary. I&#039;ve registered on both other sites but will wait a while before being brave enough to try. In the mean time I will just keep my house clean so I have no worries.

				<br />@ripplingwalls(I would&#039;ve just quoted it but it wouldn&#039;t let me?)<br /><br />If it was already marked in transit and you used PGP I wouldn&#039;t be concerned. Even during the best of times packages still arrived late. Why? Who knows, but they did. I placed 2 orders the night of DPR&#039;s arrest, actually after it if the FBI&#039;s timeline is to be believed, and both have since arrived.&nbsp; Really as long as you trust the vendor actually sent the package instead of marking it sent and planning to do so later you should be fine.&nbsp; 8 days for overseas actually isn&#039;t that bad, even if it is later than usual.&nbsp; And as long as you used PGP there&#039;s nothing to suggest LE would know anything more than what they can find out from SR, which is basically useless as long as vital info was encrypted.&nbsp; Again, I can personally confirm that orders, even placed in the last minutes of SR&#039;s existence, made it through. As long as proper security protocol was followed by both parties and the vendor(in your case) sent it out as they said you should be fine. Hope this helps you relax a bit. Sit tight and I&#039;m sure everything will work out.

				@robotrippin<br /><br />unfortunately i did not use pgp because the vendor i did biz with had just made an account. so i did not see any pgp key related shit like &quot;heres my pgp key:....&quot; i could be wrong maybe i was too high and i missed it but i did not use pgp. damn. hopefully the vendor i did biz with aint on their radar, they were pretty lowkey...but anyway i havent gotten cd&#039;ed or anything. im hoping itll still come, fingers crossed. im giving it 25 days before i complete give up hope cuz i remember once i lost hope on an order and then on day 25 it arrived ahaha so thats my standard<br /><br />also, since i didnt use pgp that brings me to this question...how much do the fed know? have they gotten in and gone thru all the orders in escrow? would anyone know or have an idea? it might be a dumb question cuz only a fed would know prolly but im just wondering cuz im not that worried i trust the vendor, they wiped their slate clean and deleted all reviews of past account and then got in contact with me some time after that, (months after that) and i did the order so im guessin i should be alright, or maybe cd&#039;ed haha<br /><br />EDIT:i see that the member named chevelle got their shit, and they posted on oct 3 that it was a no show. hopefully my shit is on its way to me

				We&#039;ll see what happens with me. I used PGP and never had any problems with this vender before. This is like my 8th order. Was marked in transit on 9/28. Usually takes 7-10 days. Still nothing in my mailbox, not even bills. No clue what&#039;s up.
