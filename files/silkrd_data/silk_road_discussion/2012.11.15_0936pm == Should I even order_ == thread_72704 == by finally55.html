				I NEED some H.<br /><br />But with SR going up and down, is it even safe to order? I have BTC in my SR account. But if I&#039;m a vendor, why would I fill a new order right now? I could ship out the order, then the site could go down for who-knows-how-long - maybe forever? And I&#039;d be stuck without having a finalized sale!<br /><br />(because I will NEVER FE for ANYONE after the shit ONE STOP SHOP put me through)<br /><br />Anyone else thinking this?<br /><br />I&#039;ve contacted my favorite H vendor on the forums and with SR messages, but I haven&#039;t heard back. Hatter! Where are you? I miss you :-(

				Your concerns are legitimate. But no one can tell you for sure whether or not to order. I have orders in, but not for more BTC than I can afford to lose.

				i put in very small order when SR up yesterday, got on a litle bit ago, order not processed, not surprising, vendor prob has not had chance to even see. lots of us in same boat im sure, need to place order, if BC are already in SR i would say, what have you to lose? in my case i need to move more BC in to place order needed, but who wants to risk unless site can stay up for more than hour at a time????????????? aaaarrrrrrgggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!

				Same boat. Last night when it came up I placed an order with a trusted vendor of mine. I was just now able to log in and see that it had been marked in transit. I&#039;m debating on whether I should just finalize early just in case since i trust my vendor....<br />I&#039;d say wait to hear back from the vendor and if you trust him that much (which i personally trust hatter) it&#039;s your call on FE...maybe if you could get a dcn immediately after order, i&#039;d consider it...<br />I&#039;m a sad panda with no real life connections :(

				Hi Guys :)<br /><br />I&#039;m here and processing orders.&nbsp; I&#039;m in stealth mode so you need a link to what you want to order and if it&#039;s not listed just post in my thread and I will increase the inventory a few at a time so I can process all your orders and answer all your questions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve updated my vendor thread so please take a look at it if you want to make an order and I will do my best to expedite them and don&#039;t require FE.&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12702.msg594990#msg594990<br /><br />All orders that I already have are currently being processed and will ship in today&#039;s mail (Friday) I&#039;m going to try to drop it off early so hopefully it will get to you guys quick.&nbsp; If you want to make the early cut please try to get your order in the next few hours, I will probably do two mail drops tomorrow, depending on how many orders come in.&nbsp; One in early in the morning and one later in the evening, so you can make the evening cut off if you get the order in before 4pm pst or so... <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen a lot of ups &amp; downs &amp; outages over the last year, and every time the slightest thing happens, the trolls, conspiracy theorists, fear mongers, naysayers &amp; haters flood the forums with their doom &amp; gloom, this is the end of SR nonsense.&nbsp; Each time something has happened, the site has come back better than before. When the site came back up on Tuesday, I replied to as many messages as I could and confirmed/shipped all outstanding orders before the site went down again. When it came back up, I did it again. I&#039;m wasn&#039;t worried about the excessive funds sitting in escrow and whether buyers would be able to get back in &amp; finalize, nor was I concerned by the fact that my withdrawals from SR weren&#039;t showing up in the blockchain (they since have). I packed and shipped when I could, and enjoyed a nice break and some downtime while the site offline. I also had a good laugh at the multitude of theories posted on the forums about what&#039;s really going on. <br /><br />I have faith in Silk Road. <br />MJMuse

				I was able to place 4 orders with 2 very reputable vendors on SR. I even FE&#039;d 2 of them to help out the vendor, since he&#039;s still waiting for old deals he shipped to come back on SR and finalize - a scenario I bet a lot of vendors are dealing with right now.<br /><br />I would NEVER FE for anyone but this dude. He is the man.

				Well it sounds like Hatter is an awesome vendor. I will now know a safe one (doesn&#039;t require FE) to recommend to new buyers looking for H.<br /><br />I shipped out all my orders. I have faith in DPR and truly believe he would make it right with us vendors even if the Road went down for good. Like Hatter, DPR doesn&#039;t require you to trust him, which makes it easy for me to trust him.
