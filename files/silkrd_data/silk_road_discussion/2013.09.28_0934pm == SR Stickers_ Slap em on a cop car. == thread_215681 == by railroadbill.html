				The SR shirts thread made a few good points about wearing the SR logo, you dont want to make yourself a target. But what about just leaving the logo all over towns, kind of like a viral marketing thing. I did some digging and found that someone had made a 2560x2560 SR logo reproduction<br /><br />http://s8.postimg.org/s307akkgj/Camel_Hi_Res.png<br />Credit: masterblaster from <br />Anyone have a large silk road graphic?<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126486.msg870695#msg870695<br /><br />What do you all think, would you buy a stack of stickers?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m pretty sure SR doesn&#039;t want/need advertising. No sense in drawing unneeded attention to ourselves. Atlantis boldly advertised themselves and look what happened to them. <br /><br />Think about it: if stickers, etc. start popping up and somehow LE realized what the logo meant, all it would do is piss em off and make them aware that people in the area are using the site. That may lead to a closer watch on the mail. Why would you want that?

				I have several golf shirts that have very small logos on them, so small you have to look closely to even tell what they are. Polo brand shirts have a little horse with a polo player on it for a logo.<br />I wouldn&#039;t mind having one with the SR camel on it.

				&quot;NEWSFLASH: Mysterious green camels appearing all over town. We&#039;ll tell you what they represent if you stay tuned.&quot;<br /><br />It would definetely get people talking...<br /><br />i am pretty sure vandelism has to be permanent to be illegal. I.e. drawing a peace sign with chalk is not illegal, with spray paint, it is.<br /><br />besides, just use two pair of latex gloves, or pay some kids to do it....

				Sounds fun. Just simple stickers on stoplights/light-posts at crosswalks; no words. Something subtle.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t think any vendor should start mass-producing them, selling them in any quantity.<br />If individuals put up printed sheets of paper with scotch-tape, we&#039;d deliver the same &quot;message&quot;.

				Bad idea.<br /><br />The &quot;T-Shirt&quot; thread you refer to, brought up some good points. - All the ones that said is was a stupid idea. The fact that you&#039;d bring it back up after we flushed that Beavis from down under Mushroomhead, is unfortunate. <br /><br />Channel that energy into helping someone. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Do you even buy drugs here? Or are you just caught up in the whole pop culture aspect to it all? This is a drug site, mostly what happens here constitutes a felony, or capital crime, depending on your locale. <br /><br />Back to the drawing board.

It just recently got shut down, just in the past week or so I believe. The people behind it made a fucking Facebook page for it, advertised it openly, all kinds of dumb shit. Basically just giving the finger to LE and taunting them to &quot;Come get us!&quot; I didn&#039;t know about them either until recently. Made an account, never used it and then they got shut down. Whatever, from what I hear they sucked compared to SR anyway.

No &quot;crimes&quot; are treated more seriously than those that oppose the state. Cops HATE not being feared (or as they say, &quot;respected&quot;) more than anything else. Fuck with their car and they&#039;re incredibly likely to lose their shit.
