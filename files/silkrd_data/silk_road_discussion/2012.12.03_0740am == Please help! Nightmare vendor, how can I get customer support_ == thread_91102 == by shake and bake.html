				I bought some pain pills from a vendor who seemed to have a good reputation.&nbsp; &nbsp;He sent me 100 pills that were just bad and made me nauseated and jittery.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am stuck with 96 pills that are complete garbage.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know Silk Road that well and I still can&#039;t figure out how to email customer support.&nbsp; &nbsp;I posted a 100% true and honest feedback and sent a message to the vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp;This vendor flipped out on me with an attitude and said he won&#039;t address any of my concerns because I gave him what he claims is a BS feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;He has since stopped selling these pills from the Unites States and is only shipping pain pills from some undeclared location. Customers are not informed how long shipping will take and being forced to finalize early.&nbsp; <br /><br />This vendor is making me feel uneasy.&nbsp; I am not use to a people with negative energy talking down to me, I sense a dark and desperate aura. <br /><br />What do I do? Please help.

				For future reference, feedback is usually the last resort. Before you finalize, you have an option to &quot;resolve&quot;. You make your case, vendor makes his, and SR steps in and makes a final decision. Great way to shine the light on a shady vendor&#039;s practices. Also, leaving a feedback before giving the vendor a chance to respond to your claims is bad form, vendors should be given the opportunity to make things right before being put on blast.<br /><br />Because you finalized already and the vendor sounds like an ass who doesn&#039;t care about customer service, you may not have many options. Definitely spread the word about what shitty treatment you received on the forums. Start a feedback thread if he does not have one yet. Continue to express your lack of satisfaction to the vendor in calm terms, point out if they are not abiding by SR rules. Don&#039;t give ultimatums though, that comes off almost like blackmail.<br /><br />So he is claiming the pills are USA made, but they are not any kind that come from US? Did he say what kind of pill you were getting when you ordered (were there pictures or descriptions?) If the vendor promised one thing, but sent another, you would have had a strong case in resolution. It&#039;s also something to mention on the forums.

				That sounds really strange. Considering the thousands of pills vendors sell, if any one vendor were selling bad pills, many people would have noticed. Like when some unlabelled Xanax or benzo pills are sold, they can be weak as compared to labelled generics. <br /><br />With pain pills, the worse one can get is expired pills which can be weak or if ER are sold (pictured) as IRs. Or when new anti-crush pills are sold as &quot;old school Oxys.&quot;<br /><br />But jittery and nauseated may be because you were used to getting weak formulations and took too many of the good ones this particular vendor sold you. What you would describe is symptomatic of a mild or acute overdose for someone with low tolerance or who mixed pain meds past their normal tolerance. <br /><br />I&#039;ve bought pain meds from many of the vendors here. Only once did I get somewhat weak pills which likely were way past their expiration date. But I asked that vendor for a small partial refund I thought was appropriate for the diminished strength and he obliged. He didn&#039;t have to. He could have told me to take a hike. But I left him positive feedback and didn&#039;t leave negative feedback before contacting him. <br /><br />If the pills you received have a number imprinted on them, the odds of them being fake is low. Coupled with the feedback you say this vendor has, then that would suggest the pills you got were legit. <br /><br />Have you tried taking a smaller dose? <br /><br />

				fake pills with the same exact imprints are rare but i&#039;ve purchased fake roxy 30s before not knowing they were fakes (a pill press is expensive but making a press of the pill is pretty easy). It sucks but you gotta count your losses and get back up.&nbsp; karmas a bitch and i&#039;m sure he&#039;ll get what&#039;s coming to him/her.&nbsp; Sorry you got ripped off man.&nbsp; Whats the sellers name?&nbsp; Just so we don&#039;t make the same mistake of buying from this dick wad..

				None of the opiate pill sellers have any feedback that suggest fake pills. At least not the best ones that have been around for more the 6 months. So it makes little sense that he&#039;d be singled out to receive bunk pills. <br /><br />The OP is probably one with very low tolerance and took too many at one time. The symptoms reported would suggest that it was a mild to moderate overdose of the narcotic. Bunk pills would do nothing of the sort. Bunk pills at worse may give one a tummy ache or gas. But generally bunk pills do nothing at all. And that&#039;s how we know they are bunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;
