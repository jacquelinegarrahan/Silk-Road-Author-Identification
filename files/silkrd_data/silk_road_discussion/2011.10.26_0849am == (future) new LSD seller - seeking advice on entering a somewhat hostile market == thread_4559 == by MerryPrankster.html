				Hi all,<br /><br />So circumstances have become favourable for me to become an Australian vendor of LSD and possibly other hallucinogens such as DMT on the SR in the not too distant future. <br /><br />However, given that issues of trust, or the lack thereof, are a large contributing factor in buyers selecting a vendor, my impression is that there&#039;s a strong market bias against new sellers. While I can see the rationale behind dealing with only pre-established vendors, this certainly doesn&#039;t help my interests one iota!<br /><br />So I&#039;d like to gauge all your opinions on what it is that I should do in order to hit the ground running. Imagine, for argument&#039;s sake that you see me, the MerryPrankster, on the SR, with absolutely zero feedback. What would compel you to purchase acid from me? <br /><br />Some options:<br /><br />- Free samples. Obviously, free samples would get the largest amount of interest, but I don&#039;t think I could really afford to give away many fully doses of LSD and would probably prefer to give away a larger quantity of half-doses. My reasoning is that the half doses would be sufficient to demonstrate that I have acid that works, and for people to judge my professionalism, while preventing them from taking advantage of the offer.<br /><br />- Heavily discounted samples. This is something that I&#039;d prefer to do. However, my feeling is that if someone were to see me on the SR, then a NEW SELLER + VERY CHEAP PRODUCT = &gt;&gt; SUSPICION?<br /><br />Thoughts and advice would be great! Also, would certainly appreciate any suggestions from current sellers and what they did to break the SR!<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />MP

				Wheres the poll option for &quot;Not a snowballs chance in hell unless they first send free samples to respected and trusted forum moderators.&quot;<br /><br />One tab of blotter per mod. Send to 2 mods....if you havent got the amount of blotter to spare 2 or 3 tabs, on a once off, to set your store/business up, I would doubt your legitimacy and credibility as a &quot;dealer&quot;.<br /><br />:P<br /><br />PS: Blotter &amp; DMT are two very easy products to get into aus. Blotter being undetectable unless xrayd. But when an item is literally paper thin and odorless, and 1x1cm roughly in size, theyre gna raise ZERO suspicion to require them to be xrayed. DMT is a crystal or powder, which sniffer dogs are not trained for, and which when vacuum sealed is near paper thin. Walter, a DMT seller on SR, has a 100% success rate with well over 200 transactions as far as i remember. His packaging is INGENIOUS.<br /><br />Why do I say all this?<br /><br />Because as much as id love to see some local, GOOD, LSD and DMT, unless you are offering it at the same or cheaper price than international LSD/DMT vendors, there really is zero reason for me to buy form you. Especially when you have not proven yourself at all.<br /><br />Not trying to be a downer, im just stating my 2c on your offer, in regards to the types of substances you want to sell. If this was weed, coke, benzo pills or something else of a much higher risk to import, diff story, then there is a slight motivation to go local even for a steeper price.

				Dont listen to the haters man. Dont be pressured from anyone about your prices. Fuck em.<br /><br />Just post your products. I would not worry about samples. It will be slow at the start but it wont take long for a few buyers to take up your offer and if your service and product is good and your price is in the ball park you will get plenty of business for your cid.<br /><br />International cid lol.....10+ days to aus sitting god knows where getting nice, warm and sweaty...no thanks.<br /><br />It is local acid yeah?

				Yeah I agree a bit with Lazy Cloud; you would have to at least equal if not better other prices. Pretty much all your sales would only be within Aus. From my perspective, I would honestly prefer to buy from Aus which would give you an advantage, and I&#039;d really like to see you succeed so there is more Aus sellers, mostly because shipping is much much faster and while it is very easy to ship LSD and DMT internationally without it getting caught, there is pretty much zero chance of a domestic letter getting caught unless you are very stupid with how you pack it.<br /><br />So basically, compete on price with international sellers and you are off to a start. There are of course lots of people that would still ignore you for sellers with feedback, keep a thread near the top of product offers and you should get a bit of interest there to get you started.<br /><br />Personally, at the moment I have enough LSD to keep me going for a while, but if you were willing to give me a tab cheap or half a tab free, I would certainly be willing to provide positive feedback if it all works out. I don&#039;t really have much of a rep around here yet so get a few more people as well, but everything helps to start. A new weed seller a while ago was offering very cheap small samples, got a bunch of people to buy (small amount of money, low risk), all worked out well and gave him good feedback, now he&#039;s going quite well. Thats pretty much what you need; people are much more willing to try with a very small investment.

More sellers also means more competition which = FAIRER (not cheaper) prices. Us whining aussies dont want dirt cheap product, we are fine paying the prices internationally, we just dont like being taken advantage of cos of aus isolation, by people that claim to want to &quot;share the love&quot; with people.

				If you&#039;re willing to spend $150 on a seller account, surely you could spare 2-3 free samples?<br /><br />In any case:<br /><br />-Free sample of half-dose of a particular drug (e.g. half a blotter)<br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend sending half-doses, as it could be difficult to judge how more effective a full dose would be. In addition, someone (for one reason or another) with a high tolerance may not feel much, and that would be the least optimal situation.<br /><br />-Heavy discounted samples e.g. 50%<br />Preferable, especially since you need to drop $150 on a seller account. Scamming only a handful of people for 8 dollar LSD hits wouldn&#039;t be profitable.<br /><br />-If the seller became better known on the SR forums<br />This is always helpful, but it obviously takes some time, if you&#039;re willing to spend it.<br /><br />-A genuine &quot;about me&quot; seller description, which would help you sus them out<br />Also always helpful, but far from the determining factor if I buy from someone.<br /><br />-The type of drugs that they sell i.e. all things equal, I&#039;d trust an LSD seller over a heroin seller<br />Personally, I shy away from addictive substances on SR, simply because I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll be &quot;that&quot; customer- the last one to make a transaction, before the seller flees from the market.<br /><br />In any case, I&#039;ve only purchased from sellers with ass-loads of feedback, because I value bitcoins too much to take gambles on newer sellers. Sorry, but those things are a pain to get a hold of.

				I rarely stick my neck out with a new person, but free samples are a quick way to establish yourself.&nbsp; I think even a discounted rate works.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to get rid of all your stock that way, just discount/give product to maybe 6 or 8 established members for review.&nbsp; I believe you can set up a sale product and put in the amount of stock you have, to keep from overselling.<br /><br />The reviews are what make/break you IMHO.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t start making up your own rules until you&#039;ve established yourself.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a few new sellers basically say they won&#039;t ship in escrow.&nbsp; That is an instant dealbreaker in my mind, if you&#039;re new you&#039;ve got to show some trust to gain trust.&nbsp; Follow the SR rules, and be honest, and the road will treat you well.<br /><br />Once people see your packages are actually making it to customers, and the product is OK, then you&#039;ll have a deluge of customers.&nbsp; ;)

				You know back at the original Silk Road there was maybe 1-2 scammers every month, now we got them daily.<br />The old SR offers samples to say like 5 senior members on the oldschool forum we had my first was a gram of free MDMA from 3Jane(Past #1 Vendor). And 3Jane posted on the forum and was talking about the new mdma batch and how 3jane wanted it tested in the community. At the end off that post she said next 3-5 ppl get a free gram to review. I of course like always was there first. That method worked good because the commnity was under 2000 members and everyone jived with the exception of a few looney tunes. <br /><br /><br />Now it&#039;s much different we got 70-80 thousand members. So I suggest that I choose an aussie and an international to the US...not me, for free tabs of LSD.<br /><br />If this sounds good say +1.<br /><br />nomad

				yeah +1 to Nomad.&nbsp; 2 free samples and maybe an introductory discount price for a limited number of deals.<br /><br />Also agree with Novocaine about prices.&nbsp; For the added speed and convenience of domestic shipping you are entitled to charge a bit more than the international sellers.<br /><br />Good luck and hope to see you selling soon, the more the merrier!<br />
