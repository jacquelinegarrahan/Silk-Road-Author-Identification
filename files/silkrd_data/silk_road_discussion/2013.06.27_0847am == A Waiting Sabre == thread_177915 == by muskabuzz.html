				Regardless of recent news it is a reasonable assumption that law enforcement has infiltrated Silk Road; it is their job to do this.&nbsp; They are working slowly and deliberately, first as guerrillas and then as infantry, using every advantage that their situation and resources bring; to believe this is not the case is wishful thinking. It is also ludicrous to think they aren&#039;t as smart or capable as anyone here. <br /><br />It is possible that a Silk Road vendor was compromised by the us d.e.a. this spring - or not - the details are still coming to light. And we believe it is just this, illumination, that is a critical issue for everyone here.<br /><br />While there are many effective tactics against an enemy, stealth is one of the least enduring.&nbsp; Our community, along with bitcoins, has already enjoyed a wonderful and cloistered incubation. It is over.&nbsp; Attacks against us are becoming more open as our enemies emerge from their own period of stealth. We can expect this will expand greatly as such exposure is itself a victory for the fear it incites.<br /><br />Our side faces a new stage of battle with different tactics.&nbsp; However they evolve it is clear they can not rest solely on hermetics.&nbsp; The american arrest and bitcoin seizure is an early case in point.&nbsp; Only a few small threads exist on this potentially significant and universally actionable news.&nbsp; While the work of the posters here is to be commended what&#039;s most notable is the absence of SR&#039;s leading voices.&nbsp; While there are many justifiable reasons for this none of them compare to the downside of several days of silence.&nbsp; <br /><br />Certainly the law enforcers will not go away if we try to lay low at this point nor will they have any sympathy for us if we appear soft spoken.&nbsp; More importantly within our community silence can only serve us for the briefest of moments.&nbsp; The absence of leading voices - even if only to communicate awareness or disqualify a story like this - is already taking a toll in fear and its fowl shadow of mistrust. Recent posts speculating on admin participation and censorship express very natural paranoia. Though it is far more likely that skills have been redeployed to our benefit than anything else the absence of words makes this too an unnecessary speculation.<br /><br />It is not our intention to question the priorities of those closest to the line of fire, their abilities and bravery are our source of existence, but rather to offer some perspective from those not burdened with their crucial and immediate responsibility.&nbsp; We remain certain that SR&#039;s finest days still lie ahead but it is impossible that darkness doesn&#039;t cast shadows along this path. It is our belief that a light will be a necessary weapon to move forward upon it.

				While it makes sense the more attention SR receives, the more careful vendors and buyers have to be. <br /><br />It seems after the site problems a few weeks ago, everyone has become a bit mental...... <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying the OP is wrong, it just seems there&#039;s lots of &#039;misinformation&#039; going on at the moment....<br /><br />It&#039;s going to be an interesting 6 months..... hope SR can combat the attacks/LE attention... <br /><br />&nbsp;
