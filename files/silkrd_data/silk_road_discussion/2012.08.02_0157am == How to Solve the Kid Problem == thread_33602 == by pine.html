				Reposted from Lim&#039;s thread, perhaps I&#039;m becoming guilty of hubris because it appeals partly to my self interest, but I think this is a good idea and want a broader selection of people to analyze and critique it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />If markets like SR are to be regulated in any semi-legal/decriminalized government approved fashion in the distant future, it is imperative that some mechanism, much like Capcha for distinguishing between person/machine, is developed as a age restriction.<br /><br />My own view is, if we&#039;re setting somewhat arbitrary limits, that it is 15+ for MDMA and weed, 18+ for opiates. The problem then becomes the same one that buggers our governments, which is that you&#039;re making an allure for hard drugs by designating them as &quot;18+&quot;, suddenly h is cool and MDMA is drool. Not exactly the intention. But its results that count, not intentions. The government also sometimes uses price controls with alcohol in the UK for example such that usually only adults can purchase items. This is also severely retarded, you penalize everybody for the sake of a minority. I think it&#039;s more effective if enforced properly, but still completely retarded from a moral point of view.<br /><br />However, there is a definitive difference between a human and a computer, not so much between an older human and a younger one. Therein lies the crux of the problem practically.<br /><br />I also do not believe it&#039;s all about &#039;age&#039;. Some people can be in their 30s or 40s or older, and still act immature. This has been frequently noted...<br /><br />==&gt;&gt; What we really want, is a way then, to distinguish responsible SR users from non-responsible ones in a rigorous manner.<br /><br />We can stipulate a &quot;limit&quot; system, but what will naturally occur is that it will be a failure because it doesn&#039;t address the problem. Essentially, when you get right down to it, everybody wants a distinction between &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;moron&quot;, because if preventing somebody using a drug in the wrong way or taking too much of it is the goal here, then the Mature/Moron criteria is clearly the one you want to be using. It is simply a better approximation to reality than using age restrictions, which are altogether too crude.<br /><br />We don&#039;t need to emulate the government, because they kind of cocked it up already. We can do it better than they can.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I have a solution, which is that you give me money. :D<br /><br />Only joking slightly, but I think this would be highly effective. Let me explain.<br /><br />When a vendor discovers some half illiterate punk (punk &lt;3) trying to nab some product, he becomes suspicious about the maturity of the said punk, as we can see from Lim&#039;s consternation.<br /><br />What happens, is that you say to this punk. &quot;You can buy from me&quot;. &quot;No problem. I can&#039;t prevent you, this is an anonymous network, you could always register with a new alt.&quot;<br /><br />However!<br /><br />&quot;First you must acquire this package from pine&quot;. says the wise and noble vendor. &quot;What package&quot; says the punk?<br /><br />&quot;Well it is simple, I sell MDMA, so you must acquire an MDMA support package from pine (and her competition) for *your first buy*&quot; says the vendor.<br /><br />This MDMA support package is a standard package signed off on by DPR. It contains two simple things.<br /><br />1. A vial of MDMA testing reagent to ensure it is actually MDMA you&#039;re ingesting.<br />2. A informative letter explaining the correct dosage for males/female per kg in a simple and easily understood manner. Also included would be the half-life and directions on &quot;best practices&quot;.<br />3. An identity number that Pine reports back to the vendor so they know they can stop putting the newb&#039;s order on hold.<br /><br />Meanwhile, while they&#039;re waiting for product, they will be excited about their first SR buy, and will almost certainly read the letter and example the instructions for the vial as a result. They have nothing to lose, and neither do we, apart from a small quantity of money.<br /><br />--<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />It is entirely voluntary. No vendor is forced to do this. You simply join &quot;Pine&#039;s Responsible Drug Consumption League&quot; and take an oath where you (with complete discretion) decide whether or not to send a package outright, or whether to demand that the consumer acquire a &quot;care package&quot; from pine firstly. Perhaps on a first buy for opiates this ought to be mandatory.<br /><br />THAT, I think, is what we want the newspapers to report on us. We find the irresponsible newbs (handily capturing both the morons in the adult market as well as a majority of immature kids).<br /><br />Alternatively, the payment stategy would be that the care packages are FREE, but that DPR buys them on these newb&#039;s behalf from myself.<br /><br />I think this is a good idea. Not only because I make money, but also from an ethical/moral/commercial point of view.<br /><br />There is only one serious problem I can think of really. That is that I would be receiving the addresses of many SR newbs, so you would have to trust me doubly in comparison to a normal vendor. But... with competition that would arise naturally, a selection of trusted or random people could be preselected by DPR and that problem is solved.<br /><br />&lt;insert your thoughts into my thought experiment here&gt;

				How does that prove anybody is mature? It just proves they are willing to buy a &quot;permission slip&quot; before they buy the real product. If an illiterate punk has an extra 10 bucks and a week of patience to spend on the process of acquiring mdma, he is suddenly mature?

				o pine such a big thinker. very nice for you to be concerned for the rest of the community, wish more people cared as much about others safety. anyway my thoughts on the subject: good idea but i dont really see people being cool with an extra person having their address especially new guys as the first purchase is nerve racking enough, and i also think some of the new guys would be put-off by having to wait for approval, doing your idea on a voluntarily basis maybe could work that would be a way i guess of telling who more safety aware. alot of vendors would probably not like the extra wait for their order to finalize. but all good thoughts on your end very pro-active maybe theyre could be a better way to go about it im sure with enough peoples input something decent and respectible could be forged.

The punk was not so impulsive he or she couldn&#039;t wait a week. Impulsively is directly connected to intelligence. Examine whitepapers on something called the Marshmallow Test to understand why.<br /><br />2. More importantly, because punk could have read the exact same material online and acquired the testing vial separately with the same outcome, but this is useless to SR because *we cannot know this is the case*.<br /><br />If they received the care package and didn&#039;t read it. That&#039;s now the ball firmly in their court and nobody with a modicum of intellect is going to disagree with that. Some will, but the majority of parents will relent into a grey area where they may disapprove of SR, but they know it is way, way, way safer than acquiring product on the streets. This is important. <br /><br />If people want a perfect world where nobody takes drugs &lt; 18. Good luck with that. Those people are clearly mad.<br /><br />This idea is completely opt-in, and gives SR street cred politically with anybody who thinks about the alternative for 10 microseconds.

I mean, a LE agent can simply make a series of fake accounts and collect address information of first time buyers that way too.<br /><br />Finally, the price point is something like $5. Not high. Super fast delivery &amp; a tiny package.<br /><br />SR requires that new vendors stump up $150 for vending to deter scammers.<br /><br />I propose a rather similar concept, but a much smaller speed bump and for buyers. I mean, seriously if I were LE I&#039;d be trying to obtain the addresses of vendors by offering them things like precursor, think about it.<br /><br />

				While I&#039;m all for harm reduction (hence my work here, for which I profit less than probably any other established vendor on the &#039;road), I just can&#039;t see many vendors going through the process of directing the user towards your item, and then confirming the identification number a week later, for what is probably a small order anyway. Furthermore, nothing&#039;s stopping the user from buying the same item from another vendor, which nearly all of them would do, so the net effect would be to funnel the ostensibly &#039;immature users&#039; towards those vendors who would sell to them anyway.<br />That said, I still think you should sell those harm reduction packages, it&#039;d be a great service to newbies who do care enough to buy one themselves.

I am sure that 90% of the people who receive the care package will use it correctly and take a lesson from it. The rest, well, it&#039;s too bad that some people can&#039;t think for themselves, but they&#039;d get the drugs anyway, at least this way we&#039;re on the moral high ground here. The ball is in the government/consumer&#039;s court if you had a setup like this. They would be forced to respond to this, and thus to recognize a distinction between SR and the street.<br /><br />That opens up the door to meaningful political dialogue and possibly decriminalization for the Silk Road. Ok, that is being very optimistic, but why not?

Not one little bit. That&#039;s the beauty of this potential project. Conservatives will agree it&#039;s a better alternative due to the opportunity cost of the alternative. Today they&#039;re all about &#039;alternatives&#039; because everybody knows the drug war has been, in modern teen parlance, an Epic Fail.<br /><br />

Standardization of information.<br />2. Human Psychology. People take letters to them more seriously than a link to a website. <br /><br />Not to mention less hassle fiddling with this stuff when they could be packing product, so there is that division of labor and opportunity cost to be recouped as a result.

				I agree with all of your analysis but also think the idea does not have much merit.<br />While it might be doable you have to look at the costs versus the benefits<br /><br />the costs have been talked about (slower orders, extra hassle, more costs, giving your address to two people)<br />so what are the benefits? a prospective drug buyer get&#039;s HR information and a reagent test<br /><br />This benefit is not worth any sacrifice to be honest:<br />Harm reduction leaflets can be found everywhere online and offline and they are of questionable use anyway: often copied&amp;pasted together by social workers from internet sources, sometimes containing factually wrong information (no, crystal meth is NOT methamphetamine freebase for the 10000th time).<br />Making Marquis reagent widely available would be great but it has limited reliability and allows no quantitative analysis anyway, therefore not helpful in preventing ODs.<br /><br />Anyway, harm reduction is something you cannot force on people they have to pursue it out of their own volition. And I think that works better than you assume.<br />The funny thing is that most of the illegal drugs peddled here have a better safety profile than many OTC pharmaceuticals but still they have such a horrible reputation that most kids will be scared when trying them the first time. There was a girl in Britain that took MDMA and because she was scared shitless of the &quot;MDMA dehydrates you horribly&quot;-myth she drank so much water she died of fucking WATER POISONING (see (2)). You could also say it was a harm reduction overdose death.<br /><br />Even the evil, highly toxic killer drug from hell, heroin is very hard to die from alone. According to experimental data (poor monkeys), It would take 500 milligrams pure H or more in a single IV injection to kill an unaddicted human adult.&quot; (see (1)). H users die of an &quot;overdose&quot; because they combine it with alcohol and benzos to get a better buzz. <br /><br />And if someone orders heroin here, cooks it up with moldy lemon juice and then injects it in a vein on his forehead with a syringe he found in the trash bin... yes he might have serious health complications. But a person that retarded is probably unable to use TOR and PGP, let alone read and comprehend any HR leaflet you send them.<br /><br />So, Pine, just keep on convincing everyone to use PGP and you might solve two problems at once :)<br /><br />and because I am feeling scientific today here are the references:<br />(1) Lawrence Kolb and A. G. Du Mez, U.S. Public Health Reports, 46 (1931): 698.<br />(2) http://thedea.org/hyponatremia.html<br /><br /><br />

				Or how about this for a punk filter:<br /><br />Rule #8 of Silk Road: If it&#039;s your first time at Silk Road, you HAVE to sell.<br /><br />Honestly though, I don&#039;t think the &quot;Kid Problem&quot; CAN be solved on the supply side.&nbsp; I am not one of those free market fanatics, but one thing that life and history has tough me is that it is pointless to fight the market. The market is always stronger than some well-meaning attempt by do-gooders to &quot;correct&quot; it. Those attempts more often than not have unintended consequences.&nbsp; <br /><br />If kids want drugs, they are going to get drugs. Where I live, the government has come up with all sorts of draconian measures to restrict the sale of cigarettes to under-16s, yet the demographic with the biggest percentage of smokers are 14-16 year old females. All they need to do is to ask their over 16 boyfriend/sibling/friend to buy a pack for them and all the sales restrictions are nullified.<br /><br />Even people working in legal industries do not worry where eventually their arms/oil/pharmaceuticals/vehicles are going to end up. So why should SR sellers? <br /><br />Consequentialist ethics is a dangerous thing when applied to markets. Go far enough downstream, and EVERYTHING you sell has nasty consequences, even products that appear harmless.<br /><br /><br />PS.

				Pine,<br /><br />You are quite an intelligent thinker, I must say.. Reading your post got me thinking myself.&nbsp; Although I am strictly a MMJ Vender ONLY with a strong belief in &quot;Keeping it Green&quot;, I don&#039;t think differently of people who are into other drugs, I am very much for providing them with safer access to what they most likely would be getting off the streets anyway.<br /><br />With the huge amount of newcomers now registering due to the recent media coverage it does seem reasonable to want to limit irresponsible individuals from obtaining substances which they could harm themselves or others with if they do not use said products appropriately.<br /><br />Just a few things I thought of, when I read your post:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; The issue of all new buyers having to submit their addresses to other individuals.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t the only vender offering this service, and one new vender somehow begins offering this &#039;verification service&#039;, and is somehow not genuine- (I am not at all saying not to trust you, if you were to offer this service)- I would say buyers should be concerned if anyone else started offering it, for all we know, they could be LE, just collecting addresses of individuals who want to buy hard drugs off SR, while in fact still sending the kits, and that could pose a security threat.&nbsp; Obviously, it would put you at an extremely great risk too.<br /><br />2) Honestly, &#039;kids&#039;, if they really are kids, are mostly all (id say 95%) extremely impatient- they don&#039;t want to spend the time to even figure out how to encrypt their own address-if they were even patient enough to figure out how to first get their cash into BTC, install and use tor.. take all the steps, then be waiting for a package to arrive just to have what they really want sent- which brings me to my third concern-<br /><br />3) If the &quot;kid&quot; decided to use a bogus, or other known address they knew the kit would successfully be delivered to, claim they got it, then have what the really want sent to them right away.. there is no way to ensure its really them receiving, opening, and using it.&nbsp; The seller and &quot;verification vender&quot; would need to cross verify addresses, which again, would result in a customers address being exposed to additional security concerns..<br /><br />It is a very thoughtful and responsible idea though, with the huge amount of new customers potentially being irresponsible it would seem like a smart thing to offer, but then again, *this is a free market*...&nbsp; <br /><br />I think, if we want to be a free market, sorry to be blunt, we cant &quot;mess with Darwin&quot;- but it would be great if we could at least educate those who want to obtain hard drugs.. maybe we could have a link to a page/ or a page ON SR itself, easily accessible, all about different drugs, their effects, safe dosage, harm reduction in general.<br /><br />I agree with Pachang, Harm reduction info leaflets/ webpages can be found everywhere... if admins maybe consider just placing some basic info on SR itself or linked to SR I believe it would make the marketplace come across as a more serious, responsible &quot;adult&quot; thing, which it really is, with potential consequences and risks. IMO, for a while still at least, Every time we are on the news, we unfortunately will be referred to as &quot;a marketplace kids can buy crack&quot; <br /><br />If we put up the potential consequences right out there, in the open, there is no excuse, its still a free market, yes, idiots can still buy off here, that&#039;s still true, however you cant say we didn&#039;t take the time to warn them..<br /><br />A lot of random thoughts, yes, but exchanging ideas is the only way we can strengthen this community for the long term.<br /><br />Have a nice weekend everyone, <br />Peace,<br />-Rx420<br /><br /><br />

				I would think the security implications alone would be enough to discourage the idea in its present form. Having just one person would be bad enough, but having competition would be even worse from a security and logistical standpoint. It would create an entire separate layer of security that you would have to worry about. You would have to check up on the vendor you actually want to buy from, and then check up on the &quot;verification&quot; vendor as well to make sure they take your security seriously.<br /><br />From a logistical standpoint, it would create delays that most vendors and users would be unwilling to wait for. Aside from that, if their &quot;verification vendor&quot; of choice was held up for whatever reason, then it would hold up that vendor&#039;s orders, potentially resulting in bad feedback.<br /><br />Finally, it could easily create a subclass of vendors catering to the following: &quot;Don&#039;t want to be babysat? Order from me, and don&#039;t wait be given permission to do what you want!&quot;. I suspect these vendors would be _especially_ prone to scamming, since they&#039;d be preying exclusively on new users that may not be able to tell a scam when they see it, and would likely be expected to finalize early. A combination of a cheap product + less wait time would be _exactly_ what irresponsible, unsafe drug users would be looking for. If they&#039;re not outright scams, then they&#039;ll be funneled the risky users we&#039;re trying to protect. We&#039;d then be left in a situation in which safe, responsible users are being forced to pay extra and wait longer for a product they already know how to use responsibly.<br /><br />A better option, I believe, would be a community funded, voluntary program that vendors can enroll in.

				Ultimately the final responsibility lies with the buyer. But any responsible vendor would provide some information on their product, or at the very least a simple link.<br /><br />If you really wanted to put something in place to help with harm reduction. When someone buys a product you could have a pop up window saying, &#039;As the buyer of this product I have read all relevant information (provide link) and I understand that using this product is MY choice and I take responsibility for myself when doing this&#039; Tick YES/NO. Although I think even this is a step too far.<br /><br />It&#039;s like DPR states in his &#039;a few words&#039; statement;<br />The old saying, “with freedom comes responsibility,” couldn&#039;t be more true here. You will find easy access to things that could get you in trouble with your authorities and are downright terrible for your health. So, just because you can, doesn&#039;t mean you should. However, I&#039;m not your daddy and it&#039;s your job to judge what is good and bad for you. No one else can do that.

The problem then becomes the same one that buggers our governments, which is that you&#039;re making an allure for hard drugs by designating them as &quot;18+&quot;, suddenly h is cool and MDMA is drool. Not exactly the intention. But its results that count, not intentions. The government also sometimes uses price controls with alcohol in the UK for example such that usually only adults can purchase items. This is also severely retarded, you penalize everybody for the sake of a minority. I think it&#039;s more effective if enforced properly, but still completely retarded from a moral point of view.<br /><br />However, there is a definitive difference between a human and a computer, not so much between an older human and a younger one. Therein lies the crux of the problem practically.<br /><br />I also do not believe it&#039;s all about &#039;age&#039;. Some people can be in their 30s or 40s or older, and still act immature. This has been frequently noted...<br /><br />==&gt;&gt; What we really want, is a way then, to distinguish responsible SR users from non-responsible ones in a rigorous manner.<br /><br />We can stipulate a &quot;limit&quot; system, but what will naturally occur is that it will be a failure because it doesn&#039;t address the problem. Essentially, when you get right down to it, everybody wants a distinction between &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;moron&quot;, because if preventing somebody using a drug in the wrong way or taking too much of it is the goal here, then the Mature/Moron criteria is clearly the one you want to be using. It is simply a better approximation to reality than using age restrictions, which are altogether too crude.<br /><br />We don&#039;t need to emulate the government, because they kind of cocked it up already. We can do it better than they can.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I have a solution, which is that you give me money. :D<br /><br />Only joking slightly, but I think this would be highly effective. Let me explain.<br /><br />When a vendor discovers some half illiterate punk (punk &lt;3) trying to nab some product, he becomes suspicious about the maturity of the said punk, as we can see from Lim&#039;s consternation.<br /><br />What happens, is that you say to this punk. &quot;You can buy from me&quot;. &quot;No problem. I can&#039;t prevent you, this is an anonymous network, you could always register with a new alt.&quot;<br /><br />However!<br /><br />&quot;First you must acquire this package from pine&quot;. says the wise and noble vendor. &quot;What package&quot; says the punk?<br /><br />&quot;Well it is simple, I sell MDMA, so you must acquire an MDMA support package from pine (and her competition) for *your first buy*&quot; says the vendor.<br /><br />This MDMA support package is a standard package signed off on by DPR. It contains two simple things.<br /><br />1. A vial of MDMA testing reagent to ensure it is actually MDMA you&#039;re ingesting.<br />2. A informative letter explaining the correct dosage for males/female per kg in a simple and easily understood manner. Also included would be the half-life and directions on &quot;best practices&quot;.<br />3. An identity number that Pine reports back to the vendor so they know they can stop putting the newb&#039;s order on hold.<br /><br />Meanwhile, while they&#039;re waiting for product, they will be excited about their first SR buy, and will almost certainly read the letter and example the instructions for the vial as a result. They have nothing to lose, and neither do we, apart from a small quantity of money.<br /><br />--<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />It is entirely voluntary. No vendor is forced to do this. You simply join &quot;Pine&#039;s Responsible Drug Consumption League&quot; and take an oath where you (with complete discretion) decide whether or not to send a package outright, or whether to demand that the consumer acquire a &quot;care package&quot; from pine firstly. Perhaps on a first buy for opiates this ought to be mandatory.<br /><br />THAT, I think, is what we want the newspapers to report on us. We find the irresponsible newbs (handily capturing both the morons in the adult market as well as a majority of immature kids).<br /><br />Alternatively, the payment stategy would be that the care packages are FREE, but that DPR buys them on these newb&#039;s behalf from myself.<br /><br />I think this is a good idea. Not only because I make money, but also from an ethical/moral/commercial point of view.<br /><br />There is only one serious problem I can think of really. That is that I would be receiving the addresses of many SR newbs, so you would have to trust me doubly in comparison to a normal vendor. But... with competition that would arise naturally, a selection of trusted or random people could be preselected by DPR and that problem is solved.<br /><br />&lt;insert your thoughts into my thought experiment here&gt;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Pine I love the idea, I&#039;m all for spreading harm reduction information however I dont think your plan is effective as others have mentioned. If you think back to highschool, you may recall that (at least where I&#039;m from) all students were provided with the proper reading material, and were in theory forced to at least be in the class room learning. And yet the dumb fucks would still fail all the tests. <br /><br />So I think the simpler and more effective option would be to create standard tests for each specific drug sold on SR(along with a pre-test information page). Much of it could be the same for an entire class of drug other than dose and such. Vendors could require that each buyer has passed the test for that specific drug. For examble I sell MXE. I&#039;d like each buyer to know the dose range, potential risks, what to do if ODing, and how fast it hits how long it lasts etc. At least this way there is some method to show that they have the knowledge necessary to safely use the drug they intend to buy and didn&#039;t just ignore all the info presented to them.<br /><br />Perhaps if sellers thought this was too much to ask there could be a broad drug test that would at least test buyers on things every drug user show know such as where to get accurate drug info or dispelling some dangerous drug myth or hell, even simple stuff like not talking to the police without a lawyer. It can still go in one ear out the other and be forgotten as soon as the test has been passed but they&#039;d at least have seen the info before.

				We think a disclaimer will of course never stop kids from buying drugs BUT at least it goes to show that people here indeed care and this marketplace is going to change all the factors which in the end are responsible for deaths etc.<br /><br />It will bei more of a &quot;sign&quot; than actually preventing much.<br /><br />Maybe parents come here to buy the substances for their kids ..show them the dangers and help them to achieve&nbsp; responsible drug use.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />at least nobody can scream &quot;unmoral drug dealers&quot; all over the place..we all know 90% of the problems with drugs are because they are illegal.

				Yea, the free market!

But on the whole I just don&#039;t see the point in having an unregulated market-place just to go slap a load of preventative precursors on the act of trading.<br /><br />The initiative came from a good place, and I understand you don&#039;t want people getting hurt and want to improve the MSM&#039;s opinion of SR.<br />The reality of the situation, at least from my standpoint,&nbsp; is that people are responsible for themselves, teen punks (&lt;3) included.<br /><br />&nbsp;I can see a lion. I can see that the lion has big strong paws and huge teeth. It is my choice whether I want to go and pet that lion, and I alone suffer the consequences. Awful metaphor, but you know whaddamean.

I&#039;m sure media and LE would try to vilify SR for enabling youth or some nonsense but if a kid is on here, that&#039;s the parent&#039;s responsibility. If you&#039;re a fuckup and can&#039;t raise your kid, it&#039;s not anybody else&#039;s fault. And if you&#039;re an open-minded (not a total tosser of a parent) who will let your kid go try things as long as they&#039;re careful, then it&#039;s still not on us that they&#039;re getting their youthful grubby hands on drugs.<br /><br />And honestly, if you really want to keep youth as safe as we can, letting them shop here is sure as hell a lot better than their local dark alleyway dealer.<br /><br />Cheers

				Through all these years, despite scandals and misfortune, the Silk Road continues to succeed. And there&#039;s a secret to it. It&#039;s one that&#039;s been emphasized to all of you because it&#039;s part of SR philosophy. It&#039;s the secret of letting the consumer or the marketplace, not bureaucratic planners, make the ultimate decision about what is on the shelves of our vendors or in the ships that carry products across the seas.<br /><br />The centralization of `power` while noble in its intent, likely would be as effective as the pamphlets that are included with all Controlled Substances in the US, they are largely ignored and those that are read are either frighteningly technical, or overly cautious.&nbsp; In either situation the warning is seldom heeded nor fully understood, and through centralizing the process it opens up the possibility for ever-widening deviations from the `free market` that is the Silk Road.
