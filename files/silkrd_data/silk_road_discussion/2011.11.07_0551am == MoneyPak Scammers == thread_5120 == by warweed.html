Thanks Sugar Momma&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 days<br /><br /><br /><br />Now although the demand for bitcoin is high and the other reputable exchangers get alot more then this i still find it hard to believe especially reading over the feedback it seems a bit to good grammer wise and long feedbacks also how many people are buying 4 or less bitcoins ?? I mean if sugar only has 80 btc ... Just find it a bit hard to believe

				Ok I&#039;ll reply but what do you want me to say? That I&#039;m not a scammer? Ok, I&#039;m not a scammer. The listings don&#039;t mean much, mostly because you don&#039;t know who wrote them. I have a review thread, you can decide for yourself whether to trust me based on that: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4862.msg41033#msg41033. b0lixtrader a full member, just reviewed me (finally!) and was kind enough to start his own thread called &quot;Sugar Mama is legit!!&quot; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5151.msg43509#msg43509 (love you!). I&#039;ll tell you what I tell anyone: if you&#039;re not convinced, wait longer, over time I&#039;ll get more reviews by more established members. At this point this what I got.<br /><br />To your points since you asked:<br />Every one of those reviews were made by real people but I can&#039;t prove it. They might be pointless to everyone else but I like reading them. You&#039;re suspecting the grammar? I assume by nature this place is filled with somewhat educated people. I think people write long feedback because they appreciate not being scammed and because I&#039;m very friendly. Anyway posts by non-newbies in the forums mean more.<br /><br />As far as the 80 bitcoins, that&#039;s how much I have left not how much I had before all those people bought. If you had seen my profile at the beginning of the day you&#039;d see that I had 200 something coins. I updated it throughout the day so people don&#039;t need to ask if they have larger amounts to convert. I also refill every so often. What kind of exchange would I be if I only had 80 coins forever?<br /><br />-Your Sugar Mama

				I agree with you WarWeed.&nbsp; The timing of the BTC Pal thing and it certainly *does* look like the same person wrote all the reviews of Sugar Mama, but that could be kind of just coincidental.<br /><br />I wish so DAMN bad that SR would REQUIRE that new buyers register at the Forum before they could have a buyers account.&nbsp; I would think that to a new buyer the idea of buying drugs off an internet page would at least be a bit weird so it makes sense that they would want to find out as much as they possibly could before the embarked on that first purchase.&nbsp; But they don&#039;t...<br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you how many new customers we get who tell me in their first pm that they&#039;d like to place an order, and all our feedback looks good but they&#039;re just scared to order because the first or first and second orders they placed they got ripped off.&nbsp; Of course, after a couple of rips THEN they come over to the forum and start reading.&nbsp; Jeez.&nbsp; Talk about closing the barn door once the horse is already out!<br /><br />I truly believe the only way you really get rid of all the scammers from a place as popular as SR is to starve them out.&nbsp; Call them out quickly, like you&#039;re doing here and make it unprofitable in both time and money to scam on SR.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think of another single way that would work.&nbsp; BUT...who knows?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I wish I knew how to make a person&#039;s computer burn up by remote control and all I needed was their IP.&nbsp; I&#039;d set some laptops on fire from coast to coast on all these damn scammers.&nbsp; The scammers have also ruined the quality of the conversation on this Forum, which used to be one of the things I enjoyed most about SR: coming over and hearing intelligent, well thought out comments, learning new things about shipping or computer technology.&nbsp; Hearing what kind of experiences buyers were having with other vendors and what kind they were having with us.&nbsp; It seems like non-existent heroin and scamming are the only two topics that generate a lot of replies these days.&nbsp; Or threads about the prices being too high.... ;)<br /><br />have a great night everyone,<br />Alex<br /><br />ETA: I know b0lixtrader and he is a very legit buyer so he is undoubtedly telling the truth as far as his own experience goes.&nbsp; No doubt.&nbsp; -A-

				Pharmville, this is my first post on here; just came here to completely agree with what you said. I opened a Dwolla account last Tuesday, and sent a transfer knowing it would take til today for the money to get there, so I wouldn&#039;t be over my head jumping into a purchase. <br /><br />What did I do with the 6 days in between the money getting deposited? Came to the forums to read up on all the vendors and which ones have the best reputations!<br /><br />I chose AAKoven after many choices back and forth, and sent him the BTC tonight, just have to wait for him to wake up and finalize everything for me :). Looking forward to my first buy and hoping it all goes well for future purchases.<br />

				I know everything I say here will never hold water seeing as it&#039;s my first post but I just couldn&#039;t lurk anymore when I saw an accusation of Sugar Mama. I have done a moneypak transfer with her and I couldn&#039;t be more thrilled with the results, especially for a service that is pretty much impossible to find elsewhere and an easy scam for somebody to pull.<br /><br />It takes trust to send away moneypak, as anybody who has used one can tell you it may as well be cash. We have all been in the situation with a new dealer where you aren&#039;t sure if it&#039;s actually going to go through or not but you have to have a little trust in people. There is so much more money to be made it doing it legitimately than scamming somebody and having your name ruined, and I for one am glad that there are sellers on here, like Sugar Mama, who provide the exact service descibed perfectly.<br /><br />So if you want to consider me just some ghost account made to perpetuate a scam than that&#039;s up to you, but if you can stand to trust me a bit I assure you I am a real customer that was completely satisfied with Sugar Mama&#039;s services, and hope she sticks around so I can continue my patronage.

				Skelton, as you said, it&#039;s your first post, hence suspect.<br />MY personal motto is, &quot;Trust nobody, not even yourself&quot;. What is even funnier is, I&#039;m a highly successful information security professional.<br />My clients have never been phished. My clients have never had worms own their networks. My clients have never had virus infections rule their systems.<br />Because, I emphasize the basics, user education, intelligent policies that are enforceable and remediation of potential vulnerabilities as they become known.<br />I can truthfully say, I know of NO information security professional who can make such a claim and be truthful, save myself and would LOVE to meet one who COULD make such a claim that welcomes the light of day to illuminate it, as I can and have done.<br />Frankly, someone can easily and trivially make a node and account, then post glowing reviews, then rinse and repeat the process.<br />Someone can easily and trivially do the same and post the response that is here.<br />Hell, anything more intelligent than a monkey could be trained to do that.<br />So, I review a handful of things when considering a vendor. I&#039;ll not go into much, other than to consider HOW a review is stated, in dialect, regional terms, linguistic therms, terms that reflect previous posts or even reinforce posts, etc. If they all match, zero trust.<br />Not even if *I* offered something for sale. As in, *I* would not buy for me if all feedback messages are of the same dialect, linguistic style of my region, reinforce previous messages, etc. For then, *I* would not buy from my own damned self!

				Yep, good idea for a thread.&nbsp; I just asked about BTC Pal in the scammer thread in rumor mill.&nbsp; This should be stickied there separate from the general scams.&nbsp; I said in my other post there should be a place for moneypac exchangers to establish themselves here, and I won&#039;t buy (BTC) from anyone I can&#039;t find on the forums.<br /><br />Almost went with BTC Pal tonight cause of his good looking rates, searched the forums, and ultimately went with SYG because he did me right my first purchase.&nbsp; Glad I made the right decision. <br /><br />It can&#039;t be said enough, but as a newbie, these forums are essential.&nbsp; Finally gonna make my first (product) purchase very soon ;D.

				There have already been a couple of suggestions on how sellers of btc could provide a form of escrow, from using a trusted member as a third-party moneypak holder, to setting up a possible deposit, a form of &#039;bond&#039; so that if there are problems, a 3rd party could step in...<br /><br />Until a form of escrow is provided there&#039;s nothing to prevent these vendors from skipping out.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t personal, it&#039;s a plea for honest btc sellers, to respect the fact that SR is based on escrow.&nbsp; Selling and not ripping people off up until now,&nbsp; doesn&#039;t mean all that much, as it could all change tomorrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />I support sumyungai or sugarmama or any other legal seller to find a way to work within the system, rather than working underneath our umbrella, (yet not providing protection for buyers.)&nbsp; What this has done, so far, is just attract scammers, who sell a little while legitimately, then rip a bunch of people off...See:PeopleB4Profits for a guided tour.&nbsp; <br /><br />Newbies: I suggest using outside exchanges, mtgox or tradehill, or--for speed--get-bitcoin.com<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to keep a friendly pressure on the btc sellers to find a way to protect buyers. { A good scammer, could still come on here, make a little money while building reputaion, then rip a bunch....escrow protects us from this...)<br /><br />
