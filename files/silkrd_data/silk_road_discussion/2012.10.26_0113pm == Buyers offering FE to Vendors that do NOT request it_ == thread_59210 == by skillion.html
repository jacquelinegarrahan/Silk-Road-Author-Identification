				I don&#039;t think it is worth the stress, even with vendors you do trust. If something goes wrong, intentional or not, you have no options once you finalize.<br /><br />If some want to, it is their choice. I highly doubt it will change the way business is handled, as there will always be those who refuse to FE, ever.

				A good buyer may know that they will forget or not have the time to Finalize later. Or they trust the vendor. I have some regulars that FE with me all the time.<br /><br />I even have one regular that even said &quot;FE out of free will because I will not be around to finalize later and SM always comes through&quot; etc.<br /><br /><br />Short of thinking that a vendor is going to try to rip you off 100%, there really isnt too much to lose.<br />My people know if everything is not perfect I&#039;ll do my best to make it right.<br />

				It was done in the old days--before anybody thought of asking for it--to help vendors out, to kind of counterbalance the idiots they had to constantly deal with, who *didn&#039;t* finalize when they got their product.&nbsp; There were many threads about it, asking for ways that buyers who always autofinalized could be dealt with.&nbsp; Some of us were proactive, and started finalizing early, on buyers we knew and trusted.&nbsp; There have been many discussions about this, and people have shared their views and their practices on here.<br /><br />Having said all that, I do notice how rude people are getting on here, calling people names and shit...why on earth would anybody want to take part in a discussion where this happens...we used to present our positions, our beliefs and our hopes for the future of Silk Road without engaging in this sort of insults, and along with &#039;finalizing early&#039; or not, I hope some of you take a look at that also.

				I have not asked a customer to FE yet. I have had a very small number do it, and they have always explained why in their comment. I don&#039;t mind at all. There certainly is something endearing about it. A buyer is opening themselves to injury for the benefit of the vendor, unrequested.<br /><br />If you are finalizing early for a vendor who does not require it, or request it, then you are not hurting the community in the least. It is the ones that DO require it that you need to be wary of.

				I have seen some people do it and always laugh a little.&nbsp; Of course you want to impress and be on your vendors &#039;Customer of the Year&#039; list, but keep in mind that you are really at a disadvantage when doing this.&nbsp; Yes, you can change your feedback if things go south, but that is about it.&nbsp; Your money will be gone and SR has stated numerous times that they will not step in for resolution if a buyer FE&#039;s.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Too many people have been ripped with FE for me to think it is a good idea as Escrow is the best protection a buyer has.

				While it&#039;s nice to have a vote of confidence from customers once in a while, we prefer not to get paid until all the hay is in the barn!&nbsp; Out of sight, out of mind!&nbsp; Every once in a while we get a customer FE us &amp; we used to message them&nbsp; politely thank them but let them know that all it does is make them feel better, not us, &amp; not for anyone else who is perusing the feedback to get a feel for how a vendor works or how good their products are when they keep seeing &quot;FE for a trusted vendor,&quot;&nbsp; and then they almost never go back in and add or change the feedback.&nbsp; Then when people see a number of the FE&#039;s, they start assuming that the vendor likes to do business that way, which makes them uncomfortable.&nbsp; We have only asked FE for a couple of large custom orders.&nbsp; We state specifically on our vendor page; PLEASE DO NOT FINALIZE UNTIL RECEIVING YOUR ORDER!&nbsp; And we still get orders finalized!&nbsp; The other reason we don&#039;t like it is that it is that when it is no longer on our page, its harder to figure out just what&#039;s going on if there is a problem with tracking or whatever,&nbsp; &amp; then after they receive the order it will be purged.<br /><br /><br />NCK

				Alright I have a question though? How does escrow protect a completely new buyer on SR, is it just as good as if he would have had a previous record of successful transactions? Because my buddy just ordered $130 worth from Gotmilk on his first purchase ever on SR, and even though it&#039;s in escrow still got me a bit worried that it might not have been sent, or that he might get fucked in a resolution if it were to come to that.<br /><br />He sent the order but only half of it... by mistake.<br /><br />he will send the rest and I will update later here on how it goes
