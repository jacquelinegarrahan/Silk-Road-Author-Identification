				I&#039;m a cocaine newb who&#039;s been trying some the last couple of weekends, and I have a few questions for any wise ones that might be reading.<br /><br />For background, I&#039;d never tried cocaine before a few weeks ago, but I was taking/addicted to adderall for the last ~1.5 years.&nbsp; When I stopped adderall a month or so ago, I could take 75-90mg in a day with no recreational effect.&nbsp; My only experience is with Tetravort&#039;s cocaine.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m high on cocaine right now, so this post will probably be chattier than I normally would write.&nbsp; Feel free to ignore me if I get too silly or something.&nbsp; Maybe a true master can tell how much I&#039;m on by the excess verbiage in this post.<br /><br />ADDERALL AND COCAINE:&nbsp; Is there a cross-tolerance?&nbsp; It seems to me like there is.&nbsp; Also, when I took adderall recreationally there would be a few hours of euphoria, followed by 3-4 hours of more productive time.&nbsp; Cocaine seems exactly like the first part to me, and there&#039;s no second part.<br /><br />COCAINE AND HEALTH:&nbsp; How unhealthy is cocaine (separate from the levamisole issue)?&nbsp; It actually seems healthier than adderall to me.&nbsp; At least, if you go overboard on adderall, you could be (and I have been) up for days.&nbsp; It seems like if you go overboard on cocaine, you can still fall asleep in max 3-4 hours (if you&#039;re not dead) and actually get restorative sleep.<br /><br />Also, I haven&#039;t really experienced the speediness of cocaine.&nbsp; It seems to speed my heart up for a little, but then go back down.&nbsp; I&#039;m a runner (on days I don&#039;t do cocaine) and I like to believe I&#039;m pretty in tune with my heart, but I might be wrong.<br /><br />COMMON COCAINE TROPES:&nbsp; There are a few cocaine tropes I&#039;ve heard over and over, but haven&#039;t experienced.&nbsp; Is this because I&#039;m using Tetravort&#039;s washed product (btw, this isn&#039;t an advertisement for tetravort, I&#039;ve heard similar things about other vendors&#039; washed product, e.g., godofall2 and roberte):<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Depression (Comedown): I&#039;ve never experienced this.&nbsp; There&#039;s some necessary &quot;depression&quot; just because you&#039;re like &quot;Oh yeah, I forgot.&nbsp; Reality isn&#039;t really euphoric all the time.&quot;&nbsp; but it hasn&#039;t made me depressed, more like &quot;Well, that sorta sucks.&nbsp; Oh well, moving on...&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Short duration: People say cocaine lasts 30m or so.&nbsp; Last night I took somewhere between 0.5g and 1g at midnight, and with just one extra line around 3am, I was really high until about 6am.<br /><br />DISPOSING OF STUFF:&nbsp; I threw away a baggie the other day, but it then occurred to me that I was putting in a public place an object that has both: (a) cocaine residue and (b) my fingerprints.&nbsp; How do people deal with this.&nbsp; Do they wear surgical gloves every time they pour out a line?<br /><br />OTHER PEOPLE:&nbsp; The first few times I tried cocaine, I was self-conscious and didn&#039;t want to be around other people.&nbsp; I thought they might be able to tell.&nbsp; Last night was the first time I was around other people, but I still just decided to go to a strip club, since I was pretty confident they wouldn&#039;t mind even if they could tell.&nbsp; (Btw, this turned out to be tons of fun:&nbsp; Cocaine making me think I&#039;m awesome + paying women to act like they think I&#039;m awesome &gt; disneyland)&nbsp; Anyway, can people tell?&nbsp; If so, will they care?&nbsp; Most of my friends are pretty non-druggie, so I don&#039;t have much experience with this.<br /><br />OK, I&#039;ll stop here before my brain comes up with 50 more things to ask.

				Oh yeah, here&#039;s one more.&nbsp; When I started adderall, I heard people saying you&#039;d be in love with it for a few months, but then absolutely hate it and be addicted to it after a year.&nbsp; Of course, I didn&#039;t believe them and of course it turned out to be true.<br /><br />Is there a similar story(ies) that cocaine users tend to follow?&nbsp; Does it ever end happily or is my cocaine adventure as doomed as my adderall one?

				for your second post, YES<br /><br />every drug, esp. uppers will end bad if you abuse it, everything in moderation.<br /><br />it sounds like you have rly good blow, shitty product makes most people bitchy and do wayyy to much..<br />good coke is awesome, one decent line and you got smooooth euphoria for a few hours, then easy comedown.<br /><br />good stuff

				yea I agree. no one is going to give a shit about little coke res in an empty bad. for me, I would save them for a few days just to dip my cigs in. I dunno if you&#039;re a smoker (prolly not since you&#039;re a runner) - but cigarettes and coke are a fantastic mix. especially directly mixing the two&nbsp; ;) <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ADDERALL AND COCAINE:&nbsp; Is there a cross-tolerance?&nbsp; It seems to me like there is.&nbsp; Also, when I took adderall recreationally there would be a few hours of euphoria, followed by 3-4 hours of more productive time.&nbsp; Cocaine seems exactly like the first part to me, and there&#039;s no second part.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />coke treats everyone differently. even off the same batch. there are many variables that play a role in this. body weight. amount you do. tolerance. someones basic chemistry makeup. etc. etc. - for me, coke was always productive. no matter what. I would be the last one up during a party and cleaning the shit out of my - or anyone&#039;s - apartment till 5 am&nbsp; :) <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">COCAINE AND HEALTH:&nbsp; How unhealthy is cocaine (separate from the levamisole issue)?&nbsp; It actually seems healthier than adderall to me.&nbsp; At least, if you go overboard on adderall, you could be (and I have been) up for days.&nbsp; It seems like if you go overboard on cocaine, you can still fall asleep in max 3-4 hours (if you&#039;re not dead) and actually get restorative sleep.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />you might want to google this one yourself. a lot of info is around about that. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">COMMON COCAINE TROPES:&nbsp; There are a few cocaine tropes I&#039;ve heard over and over, but haven&#039;t experienced.&nbsp; Is this because I&#039;m using Tetravort&#039;s washed product (btw, this isn&#039;t an advertisement for tetravort, I&#039;ve heard similar things about other vendors&#039; washed product, e.g., godofall2 and roberte):<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />what do you mean by this? name a few examples. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Depression (Comedown): I&#039;ve never experienced this.&nbsp; There&#039;s some necessary &quot;depression&quot; just because you&#039;re like &quot;Oh yeah, I forgot.&nbsp; Reality isn&#039;t really euphoric all the time.&quot;&nbsp; but it hasn&#039;t made me depressed, more like &quot;Well, that sorta sucks.&nbsp; Oh well, moving on...&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Short duration: People say cocaine lasts 30m or so.&nbsp; Last night I took somewhere between 0.5g and 1g at midnight, and with just one extra line around 3am, I was really high until about 6am.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />the actual coke high - just like a heroin &quot;rush&quot; - lasts a very short duration. but the coke is still in your system, and depending on how much you did/tolerance, it could keep you going for hours. not nearly as long as meth - but for users like yourself, long enough. as for the comedown, well, it will come&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; and it fucking blows. I would always make sure to have some oxys or xanax around to help with the comedowns. but it also depends on the blow. I personally never had washed coke before, so maybe since it&#039;s washed, it cleaner and there is less of a comedown. try someone elses non-washed coke and keep in mind the difference. I would love to hear a report back about that. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">OTHER PEOPLE:&nbsp; The first few times I tried cocaine, I was self-conscious and didn&#039;t want to be around other people.&nbsp; I thought they might be able to tell.&nbsp; Last night was the first time I was around other people, but I still just decided to go to a strip club, since I was pretty confident they wouldn&#039;t mind even if they could tell.&nbsp; (Btw, this turned out to be tons of fun:&nbsp; Cocaine making me think I&#039;m awesome + paying women to act like they think I&#039;m awesome &gt; disneyland)&nbsp; Anyway, can people tell?&nbsp; If so, will they care?&nbsp; Most of my friends are pretty non-druggie, so I don&#039;t have much experience with this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />as for your friends....well that&#039;s up to you man. chances are that no one can give you advice about this. you will just have to judge it yourself. I was in a similar situation a while back with a few of my friends. what I have learned is that all you need to do it turn one or two of them and the rest will either follow or realize it isn&#039;t a big deal. haha. and the way I did this was, while drinking one night, I pulled aside one of my more liberal friends and got on the conversation of drugs. I felt my way through the convo a bit to gauge his interest. and when we got on the subject of coke, I asked him if he ever tried it - or would like to try it. and when he said &quot;yes&quot;....then BAM, I pulled out my little bag of coke. and we blew lines. haha. then he went and asked another guy in the group - one he felt would be into it.....and well, you see the pattern.&nbsp; :) :) soon enough everyone was fucking cool with it and realized it really was not as big of a deal as the media, and other propaganda douches made it out to be. so think about that mang. but like I said, it&#039;s ultimately up to you whether to introduce it to your friends. <br /><br />hope this helps&nbsp; 8) 8)<br /><br />-habitat

				ah shit, I&#039;ll try to find the article. There was a paper published in I think BMJ or the Lancet. A guy rubbed cocaine in his urethra and embarked on a coke fueled sex session. He got dick necrosis and priapism. He had to have his genitals and a leg removed&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Don&#039;t fuck coke people!<br /><br />Got the gist of the story right, neatly summarized here....<br />http://cocaine.org/health/dangers.html

				cocaine and adderall do share a similar tolerance, correct. Not the same exact tolerance, only the same tolerance in that your body builds a very strong &quot;stimulant&quot; tolerance. It&#039;s not that noticeable but there is an obvious one. <br /><br />However what you do appear to have is AMAZING blow, I&#039;d cherish the quality of the shit you got because there are many people on the street right now who get shit 45-50% less pure then you do. :/
