				I started this to thread to fill a void that had been inquired about in multiplicity then I was apprised of a more direct (and safer to the community who can&#039;t associate this pseudonym with who I am) method for getting spare funds to where they belong. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mr Ulbricht&#039;s parents are apparently asking for bail funds and can be contacted at rossulbricht@gmail.com, while it seems that his attorney, Brandon LeBlanc, can also handle donations via his office on 415-436-7700.

Many of you know who I am and what I represent. Unfortunately I cannot reveal my identity in order to gain credibility. I&#039;ll leave hints here and there for the most adept to figure it out :) <br /><br />I have (obviously) not had contact with Ross since (a few days before) his arrest. I&#039;d like to consider myself a close friend, but with his preoccupation with Silk Road he hasn&#039;t had much time for me :(<br /><br />In light of recent inquiries regarding donations, I have decided to step up. I created a couple (overpriced but royalties on sites like that suck bawls) FreeDPR t-shirts. Profit on them is 10 and change. I have also created a wallet for the purpose of collecting donations. You&#039;ll have to PM me for the address if you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />The funds can go towards obtaining real / additional counsel, bail if one is set, and/or commissary (they charge a dollar for Ramen in prison, wtf?) at his discretion.<br /><br />There are not enough good things I can say about Ross, so I&#039;ll refrain from the flowery writing. What he did was unprecedented and amazing for those seeking to be free from oppression. I&#039;m happy for the opportunity to give back to someone who has given so much to myself and the community as a whole.<br /><br />I will be gone for most of the day (are you ready for some Fooseball?!), but will individually address all questions / suggestions tonight or tomorrow. I also wouldn&#039;t mind design ideas for more shirts.<br /><br />I will set up a new PGP tonight or tomorrow, and can be reached at FreeDPR@safe-mail.net<br /><br />Cirrus, can you sticky this bro. <br /><br />Clearnet -Link to t-shirts<br />Fuck it, no shirts for you!<br />Clearnet -Link to t-shirts<br /><br />Free DPR

				As far as I know there hasn&#039;t been anyone attempting to collect donations. Had I seen that, I would have contributed and stayed in the shadows. I&#039;m aware he isn&#039;t anon anymore, what he&#039;s known for is currently well known. I don&#039;t want to be known for helping him. It isn&#039;t about remaining anon to the community, it&#039;s about remaining anon to the feds who scour these boards.<br /><br />Evoc blow your nose! I&#039;m making an effort to help someone with their situation, in the absence of anyone else doing so, who did a hell of a lot more than occasionally talk about government oppression and how fucked up it is like I do. I will forever have undying respect for him, and wouldn&#039;t use his name for the gain of paltry funds.

This had not previously come to my attention. Editing my first post to reflect this information for those interested in donating (and doing so myself). In light of more direct avenues of contribution, I suppose buy a shirt if you like it, the measly $10.19 royalty per unit will be forwarded to the family. IIRC the slider goes as low as $16, with base price of shirt being $15, (negligible 85 pennies royalty or someshit like that), so if you&#039;d like a shirt without paying the exorbitant price I had to set to potentially generate reasonable funds, let me know and I&#039;ll price it as low as the site will let me for you.<br /><br />Evoc, personally knowing that my intentions were 100% genuine, I will thank you for the compliment revolving around that aspect of my intentions. TBH I wouldn&#039;t have bothered with the t-shirt sales proceeds (not time efficient to individually verify every $10.19 donation made it to where it was claimed to be going. However,&nbsp; for those that directly donated, I will be providing them with a straightforward SS of the funds transfer to designated recipient.

				I don&#039;t think this is a scam. The idea of donating to help out as a community is nice. But...and correct me if i&#039;m wrong by all means...the purpose of this entire community is anonymity? <br /><br />So basically we&#039;re donating money by buying T-shirts that say &quot;Free DPR&quot;... after spending quite a great deal of time and effort dissociating ourselves from this very website and trying our best to hide our identity?<br /><br />IDK about anyone else. As much as I&#039;d like to help the guy out, I&#039;m not going to reveal that I even know what &quot;Silkroad&quot; or &quot;DPR&quot; means IRL. I&#039;d rather just donate money via BTC anonymously. And I say &quot;the guy&quot; because hell, who even knows if he was legitimately DPR. No proof one way or the other if it was him, or a frame, fall guy, second in command, or any of the other hundred theories out there.

Actually,&nbsp; he is not even a &quot;total&quot;.... he is just a piece of shit!&nbsp; As this is such a lame attempt at scamming..I mean it is fucking T shirts!!! That NO ONE buy bTW as everyone would be too scared to place an order!!<br /><br />If someone was just trying to sell T-shirts&nbsp; that said &quot;Free DPR&quot; no one is here would buy one. They would believe that it was the FBI selling them to try and get the forum members address and real name! The if you got past that...they were for sale on ebay... that would really throw the crazies a loop! As they would then break down how wearing it in public would make&nbsp; you a target for LE. How making the purchase on Ebay meant that you had to give your mailing address and when you did that...the FBI used that address you gave and ran it against all the addresses it found on the SR servers trying to find out who you are!!! And there would be 100&#039;s of other things said.<br /><br />But starting off his stupid message saying that he cant use his &quot;real name&quot; but he will drop hints as to who he is....and that we all &quot;know him&quot;..... that he is a personal friend of DPR(who gives a fuck) but DPR has been too busy for him.....then he types &quot;sad face&quot;....then he throws out a command for the Mod to make it a sticky and the way he says it is such that of course it will happen.<br /><br />So he was just a fucking douche.... Then it was SELLING T SHIRTS TO RAISE MONEY???? What fucking year does this guy think it is??? T Shirts???? What a stupid idea.<br /><br /><br />***&nbsp; if you read the report it talks about how he paid the &quot;Killers&quot;&nbsp; a wire transfer out of Australia .....for him to do that he had to have &quot; cash &quot;.&nbsp; DPR&nbsp; will have money for private attorneys by the time this go&#039;s to any kind of trial. He will need it.

				I had an idea this would happen which is why I gave it a few days to give someone else the opportunity to step up and accept the backlash from the community. Nobody else did to my knowledge so I filled the gap. I&#039;m happy my endeavors resulted in more direct avenues to donate and I was able to step down; I am disappointed in still being personally attacked for trying to help a friend.<br /><br />To further clarify a couple things: the more paranoid you are about your affiliation with the Road you are, the more it appears to be an ill conceived idea. This was something I put some thought into and came to the conclusion that all of those fears could be offset by similar precautions that we&#039;re accustomed to from selling / buying on the Road. As far as public recognition goes, it&#039;s a federal case; local LEO is not familiar with the acronym DPR. I don&#039;t think a head-up nod of acknowledgment from a fella Roadie is bad recognition. The day after his arrest I had a plain T pressed with Free DPR at a kiosk and rocked it fearlessly. <br /><br />And when I stated close friend, I was not intending to insinuate we knew each other IRL, and tried to make it clear I considered him a closer friend to me than me to him. We used to speak semi-regularly on the interwebs, and in the past 6 months I&#039;d be lucky to hear from him a couple times a month. For everything he did for us, I see him as an individual where everything he touches should turn to gold.<br /><br />I&#039;m not apologizing for asking for donations for him, I&#039;m satisfied with myself for taking the offensive response of the community that I knew would be forthcoming to do what I can for him. I meant to do it last night (but I&#039;d been drinking when I edited the first post), but I will be removing the link to the t-shirts. Leaving the rest of the post (without accepting donations myself) in the hopes community sentiment will become more positive towards my intentions. I suppose I understand your skepticism, but I was hurt and saddened by the inherently vicious nature and personal attacks from some of you when I was only trying to help.<br /><br />I would hope and assume he has funds in excess of the 3.x million that was seized buried in a desert somewhere, but I wouldn&#039;t think he would have a public defender if that were the case. CD attorneys would be more than happy to accept his dirty cash in exchange for defense, you better call Saul.

				To both of the last 2 irrelevant non-factors:<br /><br />imyourpusher, I never stated he was guilty in the eyes of the legal system. In my eyes all he is even potentially guilty (responsible for according to me) of is providing us with an avenue of combating oppression from an over-sized out of control tyrannical government, that&#039;s a far cry from a crime in my view. I&#039;ve recently become aware that the 26,000btc that were seized in conjunction with SR were a mere fraction of the 600,000btc that were seized (yet unrealizable) by the FBI. The double seizure / revocation says to me anything he has remaining is small change and un-usable to obtain adequate defense. I&#039;m not familiar with his parents financial status, presumably upper-middle class based solely on his education, but I doubt SR proceeds are going to benefit them. After I&#039;ve rescinded every possible way for me to possibly inappropriately take funds from the community in light of more official and direct alternatives to contributing to his defense, I&#039;m appalled at the fact you can be ignorant enough to hold that opinion.<br /><br />Dutchi, Following my creation of this thread, I became aware of additional (and more credible to the community as a whole) preexisting lines to get funds to DPR and his case, this knowledge resulted in me advising people to follow those roads.<br /><br /><br />To the community that may pick&#039;n&#039;choose reading only the last post in a thread before adopting an opinion, here is my mindset...<br /><br />1. For 2 days people asked about donating to DPR; nobody stepped up.<br />2. I undertook negligible but considerable risk to get funds from the community to him.<br />3. I was simultaneously attacked while being made aware of more direct alternatives to myself.<br />4. I promoted the more direct alternatives.<br />5. I continued to be attacked for trying to help.<br />6. I cried
