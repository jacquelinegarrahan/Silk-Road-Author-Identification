				It appears that with the new fees and shipping and hedging customers of mine are getting taxed on average 12-20% on orders. My only option is to lower my prices. The commission on lower priced orders SUCKS. <br /><br />Also, I feel like Gil from the Simpsons. Slow business week. I miss being busy.

				I just had a finalized order and I got paid exactly what I was supposed to to the cent after my math but the buyers are the ones getting the squeeze. I mean they initially have to pay fees just to even get bitcoins, before they pay for commission, hedging and shipping. <br /><br />Glad I don&#039;t buy coins anymore.

When DPR published that formula, a bitcoin was worth $77. At that rate, a $300 item would have a commission of 7.5% or $22.50. Now that a bitcoin is worth $97, a $300 item has a commission of 8.0% or $24.00. That&#039;s a difference of $2.50. I don&#039;t know if that explains all of the difference that people are seeing.

				The commission is based on bitcoins. If you price your items in bitcoins, the commission won&#039;t change.<br /><br />But let&#039;s say you have an item priced at $100. Right now it&#039;s worth about 1 bitcoin.&nbsp; If the USD/BTC exchange rate goes up to $200, then that item will cost 0.5 bitcoins, so obviously the commission rate will be different.<br />

				Another confounding factor is that now SR can display in many currencies, yet still uses USD internally. If you&#039;re a vendor using AUD, the floating AUD/USD exchange rate will further push your return from expected return.<br /><br />(clearnet) AUD/USD bounces around 5% over the past month...<br />http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e2achvpaqi0<br />

So if I am not hedging then the change in bitcoin value won&#039;t change the commission?<br /><br />I have no idea what people mean by floating commission fee.<br /><br />I am set to no-hedge pre-commission pricing, I just hope this results in a simple predictable amount of money coming in.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />With your setup, you don&#039;t have to worry about commission costs are far as factoring in your bottom line, net profit. <br /><br />For instance, look at your listed orders page. Note the prices you see. That was the price you set.<br />Now click on any one of those listings (not the edit link, the listing link on the listed items page). That is the price + SR Fee the buyer sees. <br /><br />Since the SR fee algorithm is based on BTC, the fee will move in relation to BTC. So buyers will see your listing prices rise or fall with BTC&#039;s value since the fee is calculated based on it. DPR did this in order to have a common denominator (BTC) for all the different currencies that can now be displayed. <br /><br />Vendors who are on post commission prices will have to basically guess what the commission will be. The old method of price tier based commission fee is no longer valid. But that old method is still a good ballpark estimate for orders priced about $700 and under. Their estimate will be off a few dollars give or take depending on where BTC is. For listings above $700, it pays to simply switch to pre-commission pricing (overall it pays to switch anyway). Unless you use the algorithm that DPR provided and convert your listing currency into BTC and factor from there. An extra step that&#039;s not worth the trouble when you can simply switch to pre-commission pricing, make a dummy listing to test what the customer will see price wise, and adjust accordingly. <br /><br />The impact that BTC move has on the price of a listing that is under $700 is small. A 20% rise in BTC does NOT translate into a 20% rise in listing price since commission only makes up at most ~9.5% to &lt;4% of the listings price, pre or post commission pricing. <br /><br />Some vendors ARE raising their prices because they don&#039;t understand the new fee system. Using e to the BTC - minus something or the other. LOL. (Actually, it&#039;s.... 6.7 x e^(-p/6) + 4 where P=price of listing in BTC).<br /><br />But Some vendors are also raising prices to compensate for lost revenue from the prior drop in BTC that occurred late last month, early this month. And if you had late finalizers or auto-finalizers, then you really have to make up for it. <br /><br />And no, Atlantis isn&#039;t that much cheaper. They deceptively list their commission schedule as if it&#039;s not cumulative. But it is. You are NOT charged 1% for an order over $1000. You are charged 1% for the *amount* OVER $1000 + the commission of all the other tiers below $1000. Just like it was on SR before. <br /><br />Now on SR, you are charged a fee based on a sliding scale system. There are no tiers. As listing price increases, the commission fee decreases. It starts at around 9.5% or so to somewhere under 4% the higher you go above $1000. The curve of the commission fee also decelerates fairly rapidly from the low end of price listings ($25) to the mid range of price listings ($500-$700) before slowly decreasing with each increase in price making it parabolic in nature. (If you picture it as a chart where commission as a % is the Y axis and increasing price is the X axis, the curve will start high on the left side of the chart dropping fairly sharply by the $500 point then slowly dropping from then on as it reaches a little less then 4% on the right side of the chart near the $3000+ point. )<br /><br />It&#039;s as fair a system as the old system (other than that the over $1000 orders are now charged about 4% instead of a cumulative net of about 2.5% before). In fact, it&#039;s fairer since its basis is BTC instead of USD like the old system was. So non-US sellers are on a level playing field as far as commissions go. Customs is another matter. <br /><br />So that&#039;s the real deal, Holyfield of if. ;)

				hi hi<br /><br />for what it&#039;s worth, i use pre-commission pricing. as a point of reference, yesterday, when the value of BTC/USD was just hovering under 100, my listings cost almost exactly $1 USD more than they currently do now after that 10k BTC selloff last night.&nbsp; i changed nothing.<br /><br />as mentioned before this is because commission is now floating with the exchange rate of BTC/USD.<br /><br />buyers should expect to see higher prices as BTC rises, and lower prices as it falls. vendors using POST commission pricing should expect less profits the more valuable a BTC is, and more profits the cheaper it is.<br /><br />my vendor settings are all on the &quot;recommended&quot; way - hedge escrow, peg to USD, pre commission. and also as mentioned before vendor pays approx 4% fee for hedging.<br /><br />hope that clears things up a bit. if i&#039;m wrong, mods please correct me!!<br />xoxo<br />-mb

If you&#039;re unhedged and set your pre-commission listing price to $600, then that is what you&#039;ll get in BTC (its equivalent value at time of finalization). You have nothing else to consider other than what your customers will see as a price which would be $600 + SR commission fee. Simple as pie. American Pie. Which reminds me. One time, at band camp...<br /><br />The confused are those who set post commission pricing because they have to figure out what they will get from any sale. As mentioned, the new commission structure is a sliding scale that uses BTC instead of USD. <br /><br />Why is BTC used? Because it is the common denominator of every currency pair used on SR. Whether it be USD/BTC, GBP/BTC, EUR/BTC, AUD/BTC. etc. <br />When it was a tiered system based on USD, those trading outside the US would have to convert USD/BTC then BTC/(their home currency) or their home currency/USD to USD/BTC to figure out the fee. <br /><br />Even though SR is still predominately comprised of US vendors, the non-US vendor base has been growing steadily. At least enough to justify the change to BTC for the fee&#039;s basis.<br /><br />As I said before, the change to ~4% for &gt;$1000 is no biggie. Most sales are &lt;$500 on SR. And bulk buyers (who predominately buy to resell) simply amortize the small increased cost or raise prices by a few cents to a dollar per unit. <br /><br />
