				Hi all, <br /><br />Being fairly new to the SR I was wondering what the&nbsp; rate for successful delivery was for people buying weed in the UK. I seem to have a 2 in 3 success rate which seems pretty bad seeing how most of the sellers seem to claim almost 100% domestic delivery success rate. Have I just had bad luck or is this normal?<br /><br />All thoughts and comments gratefully received. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had around 10 orders delivered - UK to UK, and have had no packages &quot;lost&quot;.<br /><br />Hoping this keeps up to be honest, best idea is to make sure you are always buying from 95% or greater vendors with a proven transaction history mate.<br /><br />Also be sure to read all the review threads to get a feel for the vendors also.<br /><br />Hope your delivery chances increase!<br /><br />makku

				Your username should be unluckyterry<br /><br />You&#039;ve probably been fucked over by selective scammers who made you FE. <br /><br />Keep an eye on this thread, we report back on UK vendors here. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11298.405<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a dozen or so deliveries, one went missing and because they were a reputable vendor they had stayed in escrow even though it was only my second transaction (my first had been with the same vendor) they gave me a 100% reship.

				Hey Terry, I think you&#039;ve had some bad luck for 1 out of 3 to go missing. Are these uk - uk? If so, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have any worse luck than ordering something legitimate, ie it&#039;s very very unusual for things to get lost (or detected).&nbsp; If you&#039;re ordering from abroad, I think the success rate is slightly lower but still quite high. I&#039;ve had 1-2 packages not arrive in about 20 but I suspect at least one of those was down to the seller not sending it.

				Out of 60+ of my weed sales not one has gone missing. Sounds like you either got unlucky due to shit packaging or the vendor just decided he didn&#039;t wanna send the stuff.<br /><br />Dank

				I&#039;ve never ordered any weed for myself because I don&#039;t really like it, but I have for friends; and out of maybe 5 or 6 order, every single one has arrived - most of which came next day.

				UK vendor here, i have had about 90 transactions on SR and only 3 never made it, these were before i strated ca sealing. Since then 100% of orders have been delivered.<br /><br />If you FE on any orders that didnt arrive you probably got scammed.<br /><br />I dont ask new users to FE so of you want a reliable vendor check my listings out.

				Definitely sounds like you&#039;ve been scammed by the sellers unfortunately.&nbsp; In a year or so I&#039;ve had 100% success rate in terms of arrival on SR with all my orders.&nbsp; Before SR I used another similar service for many years until the orders from there started sporadically going missing every now and then.&nbsp; I suspect that in that case the seller started selectively scamming because their packaging was always so good it didn&#039;t make sense for the packages to not arrive.&nbsp; I only stumbled onto SR because I wanted to see if there were other similar but more reliable services available and a friend recommended this place.&nbsp; I hope you have better success with your future orders here, there are plenty of reliable UK weed vendors usually although at the moment there&#039;s a lot less listings for some reason than there were a month ago or so.&nbsp; Right now I have a bunch of bitcoins in my SR account but the vendors I usually buy from aren&#039;t listing anything so I will have to order from a vendor I haven&#039;t used before.&nbsp; Will probably go with UKMJ based on their feedback.<br /><br />Domestic UK orders usually come next day but have sometimes taken as long as 3 or 4 working days.&nbsp; If a domestic order doesn&#039;t arrive it&#039;s most likely because it wasn&#039;t sent or the packaging was very poor.&nbsp; What vendors were the orders from that didn&#039;t arrive and were you asked to FE?&nbsp; I recommend reading through the UK cannabis buyers thread and ordering from vendors with the highest feedback ratings.
