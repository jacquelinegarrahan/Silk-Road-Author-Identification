				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hey gang,<br /><br />What a week!&nbsp; How do I even begin trying to summarize all of this?&nbsp; A couple of weeks ago, we started seeing the accessibility and speed of Silk Road start to drop, especially around peak hours.&nbsp; Monitoring the number of incoming connections, pageviews and registrations showed record breaking numbers, so the obvious conclusion was that we were getting an influx of new members that was overloading our current infrastructure.&nbsp; We immediately went to work identifying and overcoming the bottlenecks in the system.&nbsp; However, as each was overcome, demand for resources would fill in and run up against the next bottleneck.&nbsp; In the past week we&#039;ve literally been through every layer of our entire system from hardware, to software, to application making it more efficient and streamlined.&nbsp; We did not rule out the possibility that the increased usage was due to a hacking attempt (known as denial of service, or DoS) and took this time to implement several security measures that had been in the works anyway.<br /><br />Then the site went completely off-line.&nbsp; There are a few things that I don&#039;t trust to anyone else, and that&#039;s the wallets, and rebooting the system.&nbsp; I was away from my computer when the site went down, and came back a couple of days later to utter chaos on the forums.&nbsp; I&#039;ve pretty much been in communication since, but basically we did a full redeploy of the entire system including the new security and performance measures which turned out to be quite challenging in the end.&nbsp; We ran into a few stumbling blocks, but were able to get past them.&nbsp; I have to take a moment here to thank my team, both the customer support staff and the technical team.&nbsp; These guys were right there with me the whole time and I don&#039;t think I could&#039;ve gotten through it without them, certainly not as quickly.<br /><br />So, now we are back.&nbsp; What have I learned from all of this?&nbsp; First off, it helped me realize just how much the site means to me and all of you.&nbsp; These forums were like a battleground of opinion, with everyone expressing their concern.&nbsp; By far the worst part of this whole thing was putting everyone through that uncertainty.&nbsp; I knew nothing I could say would make any difference until you had access to your funds and were able to use the site again.&nbsp; So mostly I just focused on getting us back up as quickly as I could without cutting any corners or taking any chances.&nbsp; I also learned a ton about the limitations of the technology we rely on and the direction we need to go to keep Silk Road secure and scalable.<br /><br />Thank you to everyone who encouraged and supported me and the team this week.&nbsp; Your kind words were our fuel.&nbsp; To anyone who doubted us, or suspected us of betrayal, again, I am so sorry to put you through that uncertainty.&nbsp; It is not something I want to repeat ever again and you can rest assured I&#039;ll do everything I can to prevent and limit any future down time.&nbsp; I know this whole market is based on the trust you put in me and I don&#039;t take that lightly.&nbsp; It&#039;s an honor to serve you and though you don&#039;t know who I am, and have no recourse if I were to betray you, I hope that as time goes on I will have more opportunities to demonstrate that my intentions are genuine and no amount of money could buy my integrity.<br /><br />Especially you old hats that have been around since the beginning, but this goes for everyone, you all are like family to me.&nbsp; Sure we have some crazy cousins floating around, but they just add character, right?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter though, I love you all.&nbsp; Of all the people in the world, you are the ones who are here, in the early stages of this revolution.&nbsp; You are the ones getting this thing off the ground and driving it forward.&nbsp; It is a privilege to have you by my side.&nbsp; Thank you for your trust, faith, camaraderie and love.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQp8UyAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olyusIALRRhZM49sth+5wudmHXeN4Z<br />HrhuUzIUQdNVYvK51moKFugB1oH2Fv+X7sp+2FRbUy1Ra5PqtvQBf9qo9xFsdlUj<br />QplvN20eXZ3+bRcjUqW8wKSDxO+BB+Q0twkE04uQj4igMgyWZjzdM5IFTxnIWmkg<br />c/HYH8hkS3BB2objHogiwQJhvX8F0A4ei1+K8id89owfv8RucP37aQxVPmpFEAD7<br />vnbE9KH5hHfw8gOeRKU5Vch4NfF0s6Zr2yFOBgx8tHsmARlsOjktXWVh0VfRCn1v<br />PFhQeypgblSPOmSSROCIfBxwei6sniC/kXi7/lJK5A7fqqjfge2HqBk8bBuflM8=<br />=mi48<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

				DPR, I thank you for the service you are doing for this world.<br /><br />I am a vendor and while i hate not being able to fill orders etc and not able to access my coins, i never once felt that they were in jeopardy of being stolen by you. I&#039;ve been on this site as a buyer since the very beginning and you have always been a class act. Sometimes people don&#039;t understand the risks you take, and the toll that paranoia and stress takes on someone but i know it all too well. Thanks for everything you do.

				Thanks for the extensive post DPR. The additional information is key to my sense of well being.<br /><br />Just a big FYI:<br /><br />I am unable to make new orders. Placing an order results in a redirection to the account page which displays a red error under the Withdraw bitcoins field saying: &quot;Error. Please log out, log back in, and try again.&quot;<br /><br />Doing so does not help this failure mode. The error is 100% repeatable.<br /><br />Best regards,&nbsp; OAD

				One thing i may suggest before you open up registration again, is to have the site tested during EST daytime hours<br /><br />I notice that at the times that you are online its usually really fast, but over here in EST from 11am-6pm its extremely slow all day long and i cant fill orders or message customers

				What a GREAT message.<br /><br />This would be a perfect time for all of you guys that talked all that stuff to apologize.<br /><br />It is understandable to doubt and to not know. But now that you do...apologize. An apology go&#039;s a long way.<br /><br />To DPR.... for us that believe in you and this site....That was rough...Not knowing sucks. But what I did know is your character. You have always held yourself extremely well...in times and situations where most of us (me for sure) would go crazy and go off the handle. You had to read some brutal stuff from members. I know you understand it...but it is still not easy to read...especially when you KNOW you are doing everything in your power to fix it and make it better for US. <br /><br />You have every right to be mad or upset at certain things people did/said but as usual for you...you stayed calm, fixed the problem. Showed class, and did everything right.(didn&#039;t even curse!)I stand and clap for you. You made me proud to be a member and a vendor for this site. You made this and you allow us all to share in this.<br /><br />THANK YOU!!!!<br /><br />This place is awesome and it starts with you! <br /><br />But some &quot;cousins&quot; need to get kicked out of the family... ;)<br /><br /><br />Your the best. You have proven it. Once again. Now go get some sleep and then take a vacation. But this time bring your laptop ;D<br /><br /><br />

(I have heard you say yourself)<br /><br />But it is REALLY nice to actually hear your thoughts on this. Im sure it goes with out saying, but we NEEDED to hear....some even felt like they DESERVED to hear what happened.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time. Know we appreciate it!<br />

				It means dick, anyone can fake that shit bro!<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I posted on my thread about half an hour before it was deleted and this magical &quot;DPR&quot; post came along to counter it.<br /><br />Personally I think they saw us old hats pointing out too many things they didn&#039;t like, so I&#039;ll do it again and I SERIOUSLY suggest you and others read the whole thing as I know some people have attention spans of as long as it takes to read a TV timetable but it&#039;s important information people MUST consider in this place. <br /><br />from last nights thread that I didn&#039;t post before I fell asleep...<br /><br />You all say this while I&#039;ve been away having a private chat with a MAJOR VENDOR and he&#039;s worried about whether to pull his coins or if he&#039;ll even get them, or if he should just try one first and see how long that takes. You guys have no idea, you act like I&#039;m saying this to be a cunt, when it&#039;s the fucking opposite you idiots there&#039;s people who know shit you don&#039;t and you guys don&#039;t think of it from all angles. WTF do you think I haven&#039;t been banned as you would love so much? <br /><br />You&#039;re like Creationists arguing with an Evolutionist! I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago. <br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same because DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort. LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /><br />Ciao bitches!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=75916.msg601289#msg601289">Quote from: BenCousins on November 17, 2012, 10:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">oh look, a signed message<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				As it has been said repeatedly in the past thank you.&nbsp; Thanks for the vision and the balls to create a site like SR, I know money motivates people but the risk involved in being a forefather in this revolution I cant believe was based around money alone.&nbsp; This is a vision. Every-time I log on to SR&nbsp; I am totally amazed that a team of people could continue to deal with these headaches when most people had doubt and accusations. I have learnt that patience is a virtue and good things come to those who wait.&nbsp; I had some time to think.....what if it doesn&#039;t come back up.... I would be sad but at the same time I would still marvel at the experience of a community existing and believing in a common goal of having the right to choose is awesome. I also saw the threads of entitlement on the forums and some Vendors I could understand they had a lot of money tied up and had every right to be nervous but the buyers that had the attitude &quot;me me me I&#039;m on fire&quot; should of looked around and seen the whole things in flames and realize they should be praising the people putting out the flames not accusing them!<br /><br />So DPR please thank your team and take a bow yourself as I am a happier person since I found&nbsp; SR.<br /><br />

				DPR, I hope this site has benefitted you for all the life-changing experiences you have brought some of us (through availability to drugs some of us would never see), even a million dollars would not come close to paying you back. Times are tough, but there is still light. Tides are changing, and this war on drugs won&#039;t last much longer. Have hope, my friends, stand strong together and continue to rebel!

				Thank you so much for this update, and for what you do.<br /><br />I just hope you hear and take to heart the complaints of people who grew frustrated with your lack of communication. I feel like a lot of the negativity and division among the community could have been prevented if you or an admin were just upfront with us. Obviously specifics can&#039;t be given, but it got to a point where I felt like you were disrespecting the community, not taking the time to address us.<br /><br /><br />The conspiracy theorists are idiots. I&#039;m not going to go into it, anyone with half a brain knew the real deal. There was nothing to back up the dumbass speculation. I hope they feel silly now. :)<br /><br /><br />Thanks again. :) I am grateful for what you do, and I hope my complaint doesn&#039;t undermine the sincere way I feel about your leadership and what you have done for us.

				EDIT: please post the output you get when verifying the signature.<br /><br />ugh, I even had someone check the sig before I posted it.&nbsp; You all are checking with the public key on my userpage, right?<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/923820dcc5</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;ve signed the message again with different software on a different OS.&nbsp; Please confirm that this one checks out:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hey gang,<br /><br />What a week!&nbsp; How do I even begin trying to summarize all of this?&nbsp; A couple of weeks ago, we started seeing the accessibility and speed of Silk Road start to drop, especially around peak hours.&nbsp; Monitoring the number of incoming connections, pageviews and registrations showed record breaking numbers, so the obvious conclusion was that we were getting an influx of new members that was overloading our current infrastructure.&nbsp; We immediately went to work identifying and overcoming the bottlenecks in the system.&nbsp; However, as each was overcome, demand for resources would fill in and run up against the next bottleneck.&nbsp; In the past week we&#039;ve literally been through every layer of our entire system from hardware, to software, to application making it more efficient and streamlined.&nbsp; We did not rule out the possibility that the increased usage was due to a hacking attempt (known as denial of service, or DoS) and took this time to implement several security measures that had been in the works anyway.<br /><br />Then the site went completely off-line.&nbsp; There are a few things that I don&#039;t trust to anyone else, and that&#039;s the wallets, and rebooting the system.&nbsp; I was away from my computer when the site went down, and came back a couple of days later to utter chaos on the forums.&nbsp; I&#039;ve pretty much been in communication since, but basically we did a full redeploy of the entire system including the new security and performance measures which turned out to be quite challenging in the end.&nbsp; We ran into a few stumbling blocks, but were able to get past them.&nbsp; I have to take a moment here to thank my team, both the customer support staff and the technical team.&nbsp; These guys were right there with me the whole time and I don&#039;t think I could&#039;ve gotten through it without them, certainly not as quickly.<br /><br />So, now we are back.&nbsp; What have I learned from all of this?&nbsp; First off, it helped me realize just how much the site means to me and all of you.&nbsp; These forums were like a battleground of opinion, with everyone expressing their concern.&nbsp; By far the worst part of this whole thing was putting everyone through that uncertainty.&nbsp; I knew nothing I could say would make any difference until you had access to your funds and were able to use the site again.&nbsp; So mostly I just focused on getting us back up as quickly as I could without cutting any corners or taking any chances.&nbsp; I also learned a ton about the limitations of the technology we rely on and the direction we need to go to keep Silk Road secure and scalable.<br /><br />Thank you to everyone who encouraged and supported me and the team this week.&nbsp; Your kind words were our fuel.&nbsp; To anyone who doubted us, or suspected us of betrayal, again, I am so sorry to put you through that uncertainty.&nbsp; It is not something I want to repeat ever again and you can rest assured I&#039;ll do everything I can to prevent and limit any future down time.&nbsp; I know this whole market is based on the trust you put in me and I don&#039;t take that lightly.&nbsp; It&#039;s an honor to serve you and though you don&#039;t know who I am, and have no recourse if I were to betray you, I hope that as time goes on I will have more opportunities to demonstrate that my intentions are genuine and no amount of money could buy my integrity.<br /><br />Especially you old hats that have been around since the beginning, but this goes for everyone, you all are like family to me.&nbsp; Sure we have some crazy cousins floating around, but they just add character, right?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter though, I love you all.&nbsp; Of all the people in the world, you are the ones who are here, in the early stages of this revolution.&nbsp; You are the ones getting this thing off the ground and driving it forward.&nbsp; It is a privilege to have you by my side.&nbsp; Thank you for your trust, faith, camaraderie and love.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQp8UyAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olyusIALRRhZM49sth+5wudmHXeN4Z<br />HrhuUzIUQdNVYvK51moKFugB1oH2Fv+X7sp+2FRbUy1Ra5PqtvQBf9qo9xFsdlUj<br />QplvN20eXZ3+bRcjUqW8wKSDxO+BB+Q0twkE04uQj4igMgyWZjzdM5IFTxnIWmkg<br />c/HYH8hkS3BB2objHogiwQJhvX8F0A4ei1+K8id89owfv8RucP37aQxVPmpFEAD7<br />vnbE9KH5hHfw8gOeRKU5Vch4NfF0s6Zr2yFOBgx8tHsmARlsOjktXWVh0VfRCn1v<br />PFhQeypgblSPOmSSROCIfBxwei6sniC/kXi7/lJK5A7fqqjfge2HqBk8bBuflM8=<br />=mi48<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

				Who knows if DPR actually reads these replies but I have to say thank you! I think DPR has done more to end the war on drugs than anyone on history. Rather than stop the war we work around it now. He has created something much more important than drugs or money....that is the freedom to choose. For that I can never thank you enough! I only wish that DPR stays safe and the site sticks around for a very long time. DPR deserves everything good that comes his way in my opinion. You can obviously tell he is quite intelligent. I do believe him when he says his integrity is worth more to him then money. Despite us not knowing his identity, the name/man DPR will be known as a legend for being a hero what I consider a true human rights struggle. My2C. Peace, Budtender01<br /><br />Thank you DPR from the bottom of my heart!

				I guessed it was a server move earlier, and it definitely seems that way now. Redeploying a server remotely (assuming it wasn&#039;t physically replaced) is a bitch, especially without tools like KVM over IP. If there are any hardware issues, you&#039;re fucked until someone with physical access can help you. Throw in something like tor latency and whatever custom security measures DPR has in place, and the process is going to take a while. Once the server is up, it has to be tested. Methodically, slowly. All via a slow ass connection like tor most likely.

				SR&#039;s availability on tor is OK at the moment. Actual HTTP connections seem to be lagging though, probably due to the load. When people calm down it will finish connecting in less time.

So when the down time hit I never jumped on the conspiracy bandwagon. And obviously you&#039;ve reconfirmed your integrity by the way you&#039;ve dealt with the site issues and doing your best to keep everyone in the loop (as much as is realistic, of course).

				It is strange....I could not even log in for the forum ......said server did not recognize the request.<br />Then I read this post (not logged in) and it said welcome and I am logged in...weird . <br />Yesterday (EU time)&nbsp; was okay, had access to all....mail, orders etc. but....that stopped in the evening and I am not able to get access till now. <br />Since I got up&nbsp; (US time 2 AM!!) I am trying to get connected and yes, after 3 hours there it was. Lots of messages, transactions .. COOL<br />BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;after reply to the first message ...you guessed it.....down !!! Cannot send the message let alone read and reply to all the others.<br />And....it was 11AM here so still bedtime for you US&#039;s, it cannot be the traffic that cause the delay or whatever.<br />This is not funny anymore, for sure all problems are not solved at all. <br />When all is &#039;&#039;repaired&#039;&#039; it should work better....at least as before when it was also not really good for a long time but then you could get in after a few attempts.<br />Only now it took again 2 hours!!!! to get connected and its 7AM in the US (1300pm here) so I don&#039;t think at 7 on a Sunday morning there will be a a lot of&nbsp; login going on.<br /><br />Its just a sad sight on the top of the page 3 tabs &#039;&#039;problem loading page&#039;&#039; and knowing customers are waiting for reply and orders getting out.<br /><br />Please get this to work properly.... and no, its not my connection, PC, whatever, before the big meltdown it was working...sorta:-)

				8 pages of thank yous, wow. I didn&#039;t read all of them, but they all seem to be thanking DPR. I want to use this minute to thank the people who tried to maintain order and peace among the crowd here during the outage. I want to think everyone who did not freak out at all, and I would like to thank those who used their real nyms here when they did freak out. I didn&#039;t have time to be on here posting positively as much as I would have liked during the down time, but there are many who deserve the thanks in addition to the Silk Road team. I applaud all of you who helped keep our friends calm and hopeful during the stressful times we endured.

				Definitely have trouble accessing the site sometimes still but to me it seems this may be because of a surge of users trying to access at certain times of the day, depending on what the time is in different countries, like in the evening for me which is morning in most places in the US I will have a hard time logging on, and I assume lots of US users are accessing right then as well. Other times it&#039;s completely smooth, not much slower than clearweb.<br /><br />Right now I can&#039;t access though, tried three browser installations on two computers.

I&#039;m saying look at the facts and the bigger picture of things, as others have, and you&#039;re just going along with &quot;God&#039;s Word&quot; like it&#039;s gospel, and we all know the fucking bibles a myth of it&#039;s infallibility. For the hundredth time, I LOVE SILK ROAD, the REAL SILK ROAD I know without suspect shit and lies, dodgy support, zero addresses. Get off the meth and have a cone or two and really contemplate what&#039;s going on here. I WOULD LOVE TO BE WRONG, AND I HOPE I AM, I&#039;m just saying to people be fucking careful. It&#039;s obvious if run of the mill hackers and spammers can break into the system, there&#039;s nothing stopping the NSA.<br /><br />I read the book by the team who took out Pablo Escobar, and in the 80&#039;s they had a plane that could fly over Medellin, switch his phone on without him knowing and triangulate the position and switch it back off again. In the end they caught him in this manner over 20 years ago. <br /><br />Imagine what they would have now, in a network they built?<br /><br />You people to me seem a little bit relaxed about your lives and freedoms and I&#039;m being more concerned for you than you are!<br /><br />Remember it came out DPR sold the road in August I think it was, two weeks later they had that big upgrade but were obviously competent with the system and knew it in and out.<br /><br />This time it&#039;s completely different. We remember the OLD DPR, that was who we trusted and it was earned trust, now the DPR thing as far as an almost brand quality thing can&#039;t be applied to someone who&#039;s done nothing even close to DPR himself and therefore SR isn&#039;t the same because DPR WAS SR, and for all we know it could be a gang of people now running it employing outside IT workers to monitor it who don&#039;t get it quite yet OR the other gang or gangs, fucking governments of some sort. LEO is my gut feeling because a group interested in keeping the DPR quality up wouldn&#039;t be treating people the way they are, and it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking you to take your drug hat off for a minute and put on your rationality one and think long and hard about the shit from all angles.<br /><br />If you had a consiglierie&nbsp; and he didn&#039;t give you impartial advice like this he wouldn&#039;t be doing his job, and I&#039;m actually trying to be a fucking helpful member of the &quot;community&quot; or what&#039;s left of it I&#039;m not here to have troll battles!<br /><br />Rational debates and discussion are what adults have, unless they&#039;re religious people, insults are for people with nothing constructive to say!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quote from a well known vendor on another forum... yes there&#039;s more SR ones than this!<br /><br />“Users of the site worship him.”..this is blatantly false. There are a couple of n00bs that express this type of admiration, but people like myself, who have been on the road for over a year, well…we do not “worship” him. He is just another mod, and he used to be a vendor on the site before it got to big. Now he realises that it would be dangerous for himself to vend, as all LE would have to do is order from him. Also, you say there is no one who knows who he is. no one knows him. *ahem* again, this is not true. There are many who know him on the forums. I will not say who, but if you have been there long enough, you would know. &quot;<br /><br />Think what you want but if you&#039;re in a cell worried about spending the next ten years behind bars remember this, and the Australian Federal Police might not have been lying when they arrested old mate in Melbourne by working on what appears to be some secret SR taskforce they&#039;ve setup, because Interpol&#039;s World Wide Cybercrime Headquaters are in Sydney.<br /><br />Our Prime Minister said on TV recently after Julian Assange revealed how much info governments share, freely admitted they all willy nilly trade info on citizens and they have the power to put a fucking solar powered truck sized buggy thing on Mars, so WTF and who the fuck are SR in comparison? SR had to be compromised sometime IMO!<br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;M WRONG, I REALLY DO BUT THE SR WE USED TO KNOW WOULDN&#039;T BE WITH HOLDING $2100 of someone&#039;s money after contacting them almost instantly then when provided evidence disappear and yet they were still online sending similar messages to other people. I suggest you read the missing BTC threads there&#039;s a few, none of which were started by me but I did show some of them how to view the block chain, and one guy actually watched it get moved out before his very eyes the poor bloke, again a 9th or 10th deposit.<br /><br />You have the hide to abuse me when all I&#039;m doing is making you use your brains, or have you fried those already and critical reasoning and abstract thought are too much for you?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been up all night stressed because of these people, taken 40 mg of oxycodone, 20mg diazepam plus weed and I&#039;m still unable to sleep I&#039;m so pissed.<br /><br />By doing my mate a favour, at this stage now I have to pay him back plus he won&#039;t make his money or have his weed for Christmas, and because I won&#039;t credit my other account with money because of what&#039;s happened and that&#039;s still happening to people I&#039;m going local again for some smoko.<br /><br />In the last two months thee have been about 30 or 40 SR arrests here, one guy killed himself on NBOMe ordered through here by taking too much in a forest and running into trees of all things from hallucinating so hard.<br /><br />It smells like BACON and furthermore, soon to be broken EGGS!<br /><br />Ciao bitches!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=75916.msg601289#msg601289">Quote from: BenCousins on November 17, 2012, 10:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">oh look, a signed message<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Man, what a nice thing to read.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well done, DPR to you, and to the crew...it got me thinking to the first time I remember SR going down...it was right after I&#039;d signed up, june of last year, and we didn&#039;t know a thing...and I figured, like many, that my money was gone, and drifted over to Black Market where hell, I really did loose money haha....but here, after a week or so, everything came back up, and lo and behold, my money was sitting right here&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp;y<br /><br />But I agree, I&#039;ve come to know some of the guys on here, and have come to appreciate this site immensely...sometimes it seems only place people know anything at all about me, weird as that may sound, as--like many--when it comes to this shit, I live in a country where I&quot;m branded outlaw, and I&#039;ve been at this long enough to have paid all the prices you pay--except one--for my choice of drugs....<br /><br />There&#039;s a reason for my username, only a few would recognize, and there aren&#039;t too many people like me left around who started heroin use where and how I did, but this site gave at least some respite and hope to my libertarian self, rather than jail, prison, or some ridiculous &#039;treatment&#039; or quasi-religious help, that is usually forced upon me, by those who claim my choices are evidence of&nbsp; a &#039;disease...&#039;&nbsp; hell, I&#039;d rather be branded a criminal, than that crap.<br /><br />But until the world--or the western world anyway--gets some sanity, I&#039;ll always be in the shadows and looking over my shoulder, but here I get to at least feel not so alone, and relax among others who share my fate.&nbsp; And Silk Road gave us a place of our own, an oasis in this repressive desert, and like so many others, I&#039;m grateful.&nbsp; Yeah, I&#039;ve been ripped a few times: oh well, usually when I don&#039;t play by the rules, and truthfully, I&quot;d rather get ripped once in a while, and be trusting, than never get ripped and be always paranoid...<br /><br />So thankyou DreadPirateRoberts, to you and the techies and my friends and moderators who keep us up and running and to all my fellow SilkRoaders, long may you roam!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thats deep stuff. Stuck by you from the beginning and will til the end which will hopefully be never. It actually gave me a chance to get more involved with the community on here through the forums. I now check them frequently just to see what is on everyone&#039;s mind, and to see if I can help any one in anyway. These words come from an intelligent individual who knows what s(he) is doing. Definitely not running this operation out of some basement in the hood. This is just another way of connecting one another from all over the world. Im all for it. Cheers!

				Can we get a summary on the forum situation during the SR server disconnection.<br />I observed a couple of the more vocal moderators trying to subdue the freakout demodded and posts removed almost instantly.<br />What can I make of this activity?<br />Was the forum hacked on an administrator level?<br />Did the moderators just go MIA?<br />Still dazed and confused.
