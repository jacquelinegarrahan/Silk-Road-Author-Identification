				It&#039;s probably due to the massive increase in the number of clients connecting to the Tor network, which has gone from 500K per day to over 2 million per day.<br /><br />https://metrics.torproject.org/direct-users.png?start=2013-01-01&amp;events=off&amp;end=2013-09-03&amp;country=all<br /><br />At the same time, the advertised bandwidth in the network has actually decreased.<br /><br />https://metrics.torproject.org/bandwidth.png?start=2013-01-01&amp;end=2013-09-03<br /><br />Tor is mostly CPU-bound, meaning that the crypto operations used to build circuits and push encrypted traffic are the limiting factor on the network. High bandwidth relays max out their CPUs long before they max out their bandwidth. Even with 1 Gbit ports, they can only push about 200-300 Mbit of traffic per core.<br /><br />Some relay operators have posted to the tor-relays mailing list:<br /><br />https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-August/002594.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m currently seeing more than a doubling of connections (from a mean of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c. 2000 established connections to just over 5000) on my relay at<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0xbaddad. The log is full of the (expected) messages:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Your computer is too slow to handle this many circuit creation requests!&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I guess this is related to the massive jump in connected clients<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in the past few days and I assume that everyone else is seeing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; something similar.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />So even though the new clients don&#039;t seem to be doing much (bandwidth isn&#039;t increasing), maintaining open circuits for 4 times as many clients is straining the relays. The whole network is slowed down with increased lag and a high percentage of failures when connecting to sites. Because circuits to hidden services use twice as many relays as circuits to clearnet sites, we should expect hidden service to be affected more by this.<br /><br />As for what&#039;s causing so many clients to connect, nobody knows yet.<br /><br />

				we have always heard that the more people on Tor the better it will run, but then now that it has happened we see that it doesn&#039;t run worth a shit!&nbsp; it is what it is, as they say- but as of right now we still do not know why so many more users, or how to fix the almost crippling effects, right?

				If everyone sets up relaying it will run much better. Simple to do and helps everyone.<br /><br />Try setting up a non exit relay, if enough people with bandwidth/processing power do it we will be back to normal.

				Took hours to get on this morning just to get addresses/fill orders. Then it took hours again just to get on to mark em shipped when i got home. This is getting ridiculous, not sure how business can go on like this. Is anything being done to fix this? Its becoming almost a daily issue.

				The site is definetily down. I have been trying to access it for the last hour or so to no avail. I see no mods stating this is meant to be happening for any reason, And when maintenance is happening they take it down and leave an update page notifiying you when you try to sign in, Im just getting cannot connect. I have btc I need access to and this is seriously messing everything up.<br /><br />For the last few days the site has been abnormaly slow to access, working but taking 5 refreshes and a new identity via vidalia to access, Now it&#039;s not working at all, It has been building up to this. Im just not sure what could have caused it. <br /><br />As people are saying about the forbes article, It would make no difference, the TOR network gets better the more users it has, Well that is my understanding anyway. Astor also said the other day that the number of relays has increased, So I would have thought that would have sped things up as well. Correct me if I am wrong however. <br /><br />I have no clue what the hell is going on. Mods?<br /><br />Just as I was about to post I got the login page, Who knows what the hell is going on here. Thank fuck. <br />The Btc price went down to 83 quid, then back up to 87, perhaps that has something to do with it.

Even with 1 Gbit ports, they can only push about 200-300 Mbit of traffic per core.<br /><br />Some relay operators have posted to the tor-relays mailing list:<br /><br />https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-August/002594.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m currently seeing more than a doubling of connections (from a mean of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c. 2000 established connections to just over 5000) on my relay at<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0xbaddad.

The whole network is slowed down with increased lag and a high percentage of failures when connecting to sites. Because circuits to hidden services use twice as many relays as circuits to clearnet sites, we should expect hidden service to be affected more by this.<br /><br />As for what&#039;s causing so many clients to connect, nobody knows yet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This ^^^^^^<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why like someone mentioned are other sites like BMR running like butter?&nbsp; Why am I getting quick page loads on these forums but the SR site won&#039;t even load up for me?&nbsp; It would just be nice to know if SR is having tech difficulties or if it is actually tor related.&nbsp; Initially I agreed and was thinking tor related but every other site I try to get on runs smooth and fast.&nbsp; Is SR under attack?

				Thank you for everyone who has joined this discussion. <br /><br />I feel that if it is a traffic or relay problem then it is time for me to do my part and get a relay going, I mean it&#039;s only right; I enjoy the site and want others to do so too. <br /><br />If it is a traffic problem demand will grow and so will the number of relays to match demand; it&#039;s either keep up with the growth of the network or risking a possible crash (I am not an expert on computer programming or networking so if it is not possible to crash the tor network forgive my ignorance).<br /><br />Like anything else that we hold dear we each have a role in insuring the survival and prosperity of the thing.<br /><br />And if it is an attacker it is sad that in a world with all the things available to us that such an individual cannot find any fulfillment in anything&nbsp; other than impeding the growth of other beings..

				&nbsp;Malware botnet confirmed: Why Silk Road is down<br />« on: September 05, 2013, 01:00 pm »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In recent days, we have indeed found evidence which suggests that a specific and rather unknown botnet is responsible for the majority of the sudden uptick in Tor users.<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . It does however originate from a Russian spoken region, and is likely motivated by direct or indirect financial related crime.<br /><br /><br />http://blog.fox-it.com/2013/09/05/large-botnet-cause-of-recent-tor-network-overload/<br /><br />&nbsp;Recently, Roger Dingledine described a sudden increase in Tor users on the Tor Talk mailinglist. To date there has been a large amount of speculation as to why this may have happened. A large number of articles seem to suggest this to be the result of the recent global espionage events, the evasion of the Pirate Bay blockades using the PirateBrowser or the Syrian civil war.<br /><br />At the time of writing, the amount of Tor clients actually appears to have more than quintupled already. The graph shows no signs of a decline in growth, as seen below:<br /><br />An alternative recurring explanation is the increased usage of botnets using Tor, based on the assertion that the increase appears to consist of mostly new users to Tor that apparently are not doing much given the limited impact on Tor exit performance. In recent days, we have indeed found evidence which suggests that a specific and rather unknown botnet is responsible for the majority of the sudden uptick in Tor users. A recent detection name that has been used in relation to this botnet is “Mevade.A”, but older references suggest the name “Sefnit”, which dates back to at least 2009 and also included Tor connectivity. We have found various references that the malware is internally known as SBC to its operators.<br /><br /><br /><br />Previously, the botnet communicated mainly using HTTP as well as alternative communication methods. More recently and coinciding with the uptick in Tor users, the botnet switched to Tor as its method of communication for its command and control channel. The botnet appears to be massive in size as well as very widespread. Even prior to the switch to Tor, it consisted of tens of thousands of confirmed infections within a limited amount of networks. When these numbers are extrapolated on a per country and global scale, these are definitely in the same ballpark as the Tor user increase.<br /><br />Thus one important thing to note is that this was an already existing botnet of massive scale, even prior to the conversion to using Tor and .onion as command and control channel.<br /><br />As pointed out in the Tor weekly news, the version of Tor that is used by the new Tor clients must be 0.2.3.x, due to the fact that they do not use the new Tor handshake method. Based on the code we can confirm that the version of Tor that is used is 0.2.3.25.<br /><br />The malware uses command and control connectivity via Tor .onion links using HTTP. While some bots continue to operate using the standard HTTP connectivity, some versions of the malware use a peer-to-peer network to communicate (KAD based).<br /><br />Typically, it is fairly clear what the purpose of malware is, such as banking, clickfraud, ransomware or fake anti-virus malware. In this case however it is a bit more difficult. It is possible that the purpose of this malware network is to load additional malware onto the system and that the infected systems are for sale. We have however no compelling evidence that this is true, so this assumption is merely based on a combination of small hints. It does however originate from a Russian spoken region, and is likely motivated by direct or indirect financial related crime.<br /><br />This specific version of the malware, which includes the Tor functionality, will install itself in:<br /><br />%SYSTEM%\config\systemprofile\Local Settings\Application Data\Windows Internet Name System\wins.exe<br /><br />Additionally, it will install a Tor component in:<br /><br />%PROGRAMFILES%\Tor\Tor.exe<br /><br />A live copy for researchers of the malware can be found at:<br /><br />hxxp://olivasonny .no-ip .biz /attachments/tc.c1<br /><br />This location is regularly updated with new versions.<br /><br />Related md5 hashes:<br /><br />2eee286587f76a09f34f345fd4e00113 (August 2013)<br />c11c83a7d9e7fa0efaf90cebd49fbd0b (September 2013)<br /><br />Related md5 hashes from non-Tor version:<br /><br />4841b5508e43d1797f31b6cdb83956a3 (December 2012)<br />4773a00879134a9365e127e2989f4844 (January 2013)<br />9fcddc45ae35d5cdc06e8666d249d250 (February 2013)<br />b939f6ef3bd292996f97aa5786757870 (March 2013)<br />47c8b85a4c82ed71487deab68de196ba (March 2013)<br />3e6eb9f8d81161db44b4c4b17763c46a (April 2013)<br />a0343241bf53576d18e9c1329e6a5e7e (April 2013)<br /><br />Thank you to our partners for the help in investigating this threat.<br /><br />ProtACT Team &amp; InTELL Team<br />« Last Edit: September 05, 2013, 01:12 pm by Bazille »<br />Report to moderator&nbsp; &nbsp;Logged<br />Tutorial: Encrypted and Torified Linux Virtual Machine on a Windows USB Stick: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201405.0<br />Tutorial: Bootable and Encrypted Whonix on 8GB USB Stick: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209572.0<br /><br />Repost of Bazille&#039;s post.<br />
