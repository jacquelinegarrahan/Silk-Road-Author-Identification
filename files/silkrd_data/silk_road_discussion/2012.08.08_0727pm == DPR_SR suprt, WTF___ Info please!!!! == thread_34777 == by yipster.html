				IN light of the bug issues ongoing &amp; especially the disconcerting behavior of the log in/boot out problems we&#039;ve all been facing the last 48hrs a word would be appreciated. I have matters to attend to but am not wanting to log in to SR again until we hear something regarding the latest issues to reassure that SR is not compromised. I know you all must be busy, but in light of what is going on w/log in &amp; boot outs, the users of this site need to know if we are at risk. Continued silence = SR compromised IMO.

				Let them keep doing their thing. SR is getting something it never could have dreamed of, World media advertising. That&#039;s a awesome tool to have this day and age. They&#039;re helping the revolution move forward.

				I agree with Yipster, DPR really needs to be more communicative when it comes to these things. Paranoia isn&#039;t good for the market nor our collective high.

				DPR &gt; Seems good now! I was having trouble too like everyone else yesterday but seems fine now.<br /><br />nana &gt; let him be worried. who cares? doesnt affect you. maybe he has 40-100 btcs in his acct or has pending orders and doesnt want to lose money/product? dont worry about other ppl. your post doesnt help him.<br />any company/business, even SR needs good communication to keep users confident everything is ok. especially the fact this site is underground, implies more paranoia about getting shut down.<br />dont get me wrong, im not complaining at all, i think SR is good at communicating server issues etc... mite be a day later but at least DPR tells us :) thank u!

				Guys, serious question, if DPR got into a gladiator style duel to the death using claymores with zombie jesus, and all of this was taking place within a ring of angry tigers, who do you think would win?&nbsp; Personally I think DPR would win, that&#039;s why I say:<br /><br />WWDPRD<br /><br />edit: and yeah, there have been some slight problems but I haven&#039;t experienced anything today so chill out and just message support or read the already existing threads next time bro.&nbsp; <br /><br />edit 2:&nbsp; Also, you guys should be thankful for how active dpr is on the forums, he has a lot of shit to do on and off of sr.

I don&#039;t mind being called paranoid, just don&#039;t like being called collect from a correctional facility.<br /><br />To others that get upset when this type of thread is started in reaction to whatever latest bugs surface: I am well aware that DPR &amp; SR staff put much hard work into running things and are presumably very busy when these bugs crop up, however my feeling is that perhaps an extra hand could be brought on to help respond quicker with info on the forums in these situations. It always seems to be that the fear &amp; panic brought on by these glitches is the worst part of the problem, and much of that would be alleviated by a quick posting regarding the nature of the bug including reassurance that account info has not been compromised, or in a worst case scenario, a brief summation of what info has been potentially compromised and who may be at risk. This would do much in the area of damage control should there be a bad turn.
