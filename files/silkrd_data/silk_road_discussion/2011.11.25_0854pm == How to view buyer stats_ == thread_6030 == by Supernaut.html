				I feel like I must be overlooking something obvious, but I don&#039;t see any way to view the basic buyer stats (when joined, # transactions and those stats), I only see ways to send a PM.<br /><br />Can someone point me in the right direction here?? Thanks..<br />SN

				@PharmaKarma - No, any account that has bought has buy stats under Account, right hand side in the little box. &#039;Buyers Statistics&#039;. Us Vendors just also have &#039;View Feedback&#039;<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Buyer stats are worthless and here&#039;s why:<br /><br />What scammers like &#039;williamgates&#039; do is just finalize early without asking you to, and make it seem like the deal went well and completed, then a week later starts complaining and making demands lest he ruin your feedback. That way it stays out of the resolution process and he doesn&#039;t have to worry about having a refund on his stats. With me, I opened my big mouth and let slip that I no longer had his DCN, which just made it easier for him.<br /><br />Another problem is that the buyer will demand that you cancel the order instead of him sending it to resolution. If you make the rookie mistake I did of obliging, you&#039;ve refunded him and it doesn&#039;t show as a refund on his stats.<br /><br />This site HAS TO HAVE buyer feedback for it to live up to its promise. Ebay has buyer feedback, so should SR.

				While I don&#039;t agree they are worthless there value is suspect, and I have to agree buyer feedback is the way to go. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I don&#039;t know if this is what you mean by buyer feedback, but seller&#039;s should definitely be able to leave comments on their experience with buyers, it would definitely make scamming a little harder

A seller gets mad that someone gives him a bad rating, retaliates in kind. Or someone is having issues with an order, they have an argument and the seller threatens to give the buyer a bad rating. It&#039;d enable scammers to fly by a little longer under the radar it seems...scare people into not saying anything.<br /><br /><br />If you stay in-escrow you&#039;re covered for most things as it is. I&#039;m not really sure what the proper fix would be for feedback extortion, since everyone is told to finalize when they receive the product and leave feedback later...couldn&#039;t really have a cut-off date because it may be a month later before the customer tries the product.
