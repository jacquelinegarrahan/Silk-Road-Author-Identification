				Post here with ideas, IPs, TOR nodes, etc. of the DDoS attack source(s) so we can create IP drop rules, excess traffic drop rules, known (un)affected TOR nodes, etc.<br /><br />If we could create a realtime db of &#039;access paths&#039; to SR via unaffected TOR nodes, that changes frequently, to &#039;beat the traffic&#039; so to speak, would that help? Like a motorbike in car traffic...<br /><br />Also bear in mind, we DO NOT want to know where SR resides...<br /><br />Don&#039;t go flipside tho, we still want access to SR...<br /><br />Let the ideas flow...<br /><br />dc.<br />

				Please tell me you do not run a an exit node and also use Silk Road to buy drugs.

				I&#039;m not an expert on the way that TOR works but I&#039;m almost certain that there is no way to stop your nodes being used in DDoS attacks.<br /><br />And yeah, I agree that you shouldn&#039;t really run an exit node and buy stuff to the same address that your exit node is running. Running a node is probably fine though.
