				Seems like the SR has been going down almost every day now for a few hours and i&#039;m not sure if its just me or everyone. I&#039;m also thinking im not the only person that has this problem. It would be nice if the admins could make some sort of webpage or maybe something on the forums so that we can see the status of the SR like If its Up or Down or Under heavy load or something.<br /><br />Is the SR down for anyone else right now or is it just me?

				The reason (i think) a status would be good is because sometimes it&#039;s only down for some people, or sometimes it&#039;s just an error with tor browser like you need to restart it. The status page would give a nice indication whether its up, and then everytime it goes down people won&#039;t have to post about it on the forums.

				Personally I would just restart the browser and if I couldn&#039;t connect again I would just assume its down.<br /><br />If I couldn&#039;t connect after say 24 hours then I would probably post asking if anyone else was having problems.&nbsp; I have never understood why people feel the need to start a thread asking the bleeding obvious.<br /><br /><br />

				There was talk once upon a time of putting the Silk Road page status online.<br /><br />Its at silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/status , If it loads, the site is up.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t load, try again in half a hour....

				I always seem to have a little trouble connecting around this time of day. Probably a lot of people trying to access the site, or who knows maybe there is a server update going on or something. I really wouldnt worry to much and try again in an hour or so.

The client system is expected to immediately retry the alternate URL.<br /><br />302 errors in the HTTP cycle<br /><br />Any client (e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot) goes through the following cycle when it communicates with the Web server:<br /><br />Obtain an IP address from the IP name of the site (the site URL without the leading &#039;http://&#039;). This lookup (conversion of IP name to IP address) is provided by domain name servers (DNSs).<br />Open an IP socket connection to that IP address.<br />Write an HTTP data stream through that socket.<br />Receive an HTTP data stream back from the Web server in response. This data stream contains status codes whose values are determined by the HTTP protocol. Parse this data stream for status codes and other useful information.<br />This error occurs in the final step above when the client receives an HTTP status code that it recognises as &#039;302&#039;.<br /><br />Resolving 302 errors - general<br /><br />The 302 response from the Web server should always include an alternative URL to which redirection should occur. If it does, a Web browser will immediately retry the alternative URL. So you never actually see a 302 error in a Web browser, unless perhaps you have a corrupt redirection chain e.g. URL A redirects to URL B which in turn redirects back to URL A. If your client is not a Web browser, it should behave in the same way as a Web browser i.e. immediately retry the alternative URL.<br /><br />If the Web server does not return an alternative URL with the 302 response, then either the Web server sofware itself is defective or the Webmaster has not set up the URL redirection correctly.<br /><br />Thats what I got from google so I guess there is a problem with redirection or something.
