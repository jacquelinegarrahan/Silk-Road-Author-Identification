				recently an order of mine didn&#039;t arrive so i took it into the resolution center. at this time i have 55 transactions and .1% refund rate. after the refund was granted to me in the resolution center my refund rate jumped up all the way to 24.8%. how did this happen? is this normal? i have gotten 2, maybe 3 refunds tops out of the 55 transactions. so shouldn&#039;t i have a much lower refund rate?? any help would be much appreciated.

				From memory, I think the refund % rate is calculated on the dollars (bitcoins) spent rather than the number of transactions completed. IMO, the latter would give a more accurate score because for a buyer, if&nbsp; he/she makes say 30 successful transactions (600btc) then decides to make a larger purchase (200btc, compared to what they usually buy) and for whatever reason it doesn&#039;t arrive, if taken to the Resolution Center and a refund is given, your refund % rate will have risen substantially as the cost of your large order was a 1/3 of the cost of your previous 30 small orders. Basically the refund rate based on how it&#039;s currently done would be 33.3333..% instead of calculating the % based on the number of transactions which would be 1 refund out of 31 transactions at 3.23%. I believe the latter would be a better option.&nbsp; :)

				Not only do larger transactions count towards a higher refund rate, the most recent transactions count more than earlier ones.&nbsp; Once you have a couple good orders go through, the refund rate will quickly drop.&nbsp; If you&#039;re purchasing from a different vendor than you have in the past, I&#039;d definitely write them first and explain your refund rate, or you may get your order cancelled.
