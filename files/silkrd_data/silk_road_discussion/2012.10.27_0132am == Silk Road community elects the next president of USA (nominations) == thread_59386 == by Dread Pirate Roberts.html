				Fuck it, it&#039;s just four years, right?<br /><br />I&#039;d vote DPR. He&#039;s got a vision for the future that seems fresh and new (relative to the current situation), he&#039;s commited to his ideas (think about how much jail time he&#039;s risking by running SR) and if shit goes pear-shaped because of it, at least we can say we tried something different for a change.<br /><br />If more people viewed failure as just another step in the learning process instead of a sign of general unworthiness, we&#039;d all be a lot better off.

We&#039;ll need someone around who can temper DPR&#039;s optimism and proselytizing, and Lim&#039;s lack of sentimentality seems like just the prescription. Plus: he doesn&#039;t even live in this country! Worth it for the lulz when the Birthers start whining and nobody gives a fuck because everyone is high because SR is the best. The End.

				I don&#039;t know if anyone else has mentioned it, but in my opinion the whole voting/election is a big god damn sham.. For example...&nbsp; I happen to live on the west coast (best coast).&nbsp; This area of the US votes democratic damn near every poll or whatever the fuck they&#039;re voting for, every time.&nbsp; So myself, as an individual, doesn&#039;t mean a damn, because the outcome of my area has already been predetermined, ya know?<br /><br />And then also, for some reason there is a whole other level of voting (electoral college) that just supersedes whatever the fuck we have to say, and this is okay?&nbsp; seems weird to me.&nbsp; And it&#039;s like who the fuck are these people that are voting for us?<br /><br />But also I really don&#039;t know nearly enough politics or whatever, it&#039;s probably something i should look into I suppose. I generally just read shit on the internet and figure out if I agree with it or not. But whatever, hopefully they legalize bud in -------- lol

				If the silliness of the electoral college bothers you, check out this video series when you get a chance. It&#039;s by CGPGrey, and It&#039;s about voting for king of the jungle, and why every voting system is unfair. Really awesome stuff that I never thought about before.<br /><br />CLEARNET(are we still labeling links like this? am i the only one that finds it kind of endearing? anyway, the link:) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=TLO6Xzlm6Os5U<br /><br />The electoral college is unfair and outdated, and as a progressive (maybe not yet, but we&#039;re working on it) democracy, we should abolish its silliness. Sure, Ohio and Florida&nbsp; will be sad about not being quadrennial media whores, but at least the rest of us don&#039;t have to worry that no matter what we do, some mouth-breathing &#039;undecided&#039; voter in Corn County, Ohio is going to cast a ballot that effectively takes a steaming dump on 50% of the country&#039;s hopes and dreams. <br /><br />Welcome to The United States of America, where all the facts are made up on the spot, and the voter&#039;s voices&nbsp; don&#039;t matter. Yes, that&#039;s right, folks, the voter&#039;s voices are like a street-game of three-card monte: Excitement at first, followed quickly by hope and confidence, who are slowly and sadly replaced by the sinking realization that everything had been rigged from the start, and that no matter which card was chosen, you&#039;d always be the loser.

				I hope all the Ron Paul support I&#039;m seeing here translates into more votes for Gary Johnson. With both parties promoting the same fucked up foreign policy (drone warfare, war in Iran) and failed drug policy and both candidates solidly funded by Wall Street, the third parties are poised to send a really loud and overdue message to the ruling powers. Regardless of what state you live in, a vote for Johnson or Jill Stein will send a much louder message to the government than your vote for Obama or Romney.<br /><br />//end political pulpit

				USA: Ron Paul<br /><br />U.K.: Nigel Farage as a close one, but I am unconvinced that UKIP is a truly, or even borderline libertarian party.

				Seriously, you want to nominate at least 2 dead people &amp; several fictional people (&amp; mouse).
