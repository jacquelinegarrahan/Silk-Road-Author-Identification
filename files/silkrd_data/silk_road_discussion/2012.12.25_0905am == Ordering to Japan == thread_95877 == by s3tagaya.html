				Hey all. Just wondering who has had luck either accepting orders in or sending them to Japan. Obviously this is a tough place to get stuff into, and it&#039;s also super SMALL, which makes it hard to avoid detection. <br /><br />Anyone had luck? What problems have you run into?<br /><br />Would like to get a well-informed thread about Japan going as there&#039;s not much good info out there yet. <br /><br />[Spare me the &quot;Japan is super-strict, so DON&#039;T do it!! Yes, it&#039;s strict when you&#039;re caught, but I&#039;m interested in decreasing the chance of this or at least getting out good info to people to 1) Caution sellers on best practices and 2) Give buyers a clear sense of reality for receiving goodies]<br />

				I lived in Japan for quite some time. My spouse is a US Service member who is stationed there. I actually ordered weed off of SR and had it sent to me there. I would highly recommend not importing anything illicit into Japan, at least not via mail. My order was intercepted and I have no doubt if I attempted to receive it I would have been arrested. Also, if you are an American, you will be placed in Japanese jail, no special treatment, not even for military members. Japan is very strict on drug sentences also, you can get at least 5 years just for a joint. But if you&#039;re insistent on trying it, I would suggest working something out with a good vendor who&#039;s willing to do a custom packaging job for you, because it better be professional. No offense to anyone here, but your typical SR packaging job simply isn&#039;t making it through Japanese customs. I&#039;m not saying it doesn&#039;t or can&#039;t happen, but it&#039;s far riskier than other countries. Make sure you have a drop address completely unrelated to you, to at least keep you safe if it is intercepted. I happened to have access to a empty PO box that had a combo lock on it, and I acquired the combo and sent the package in the name of the previous box holder. Be safe.

				Yeah...I expected this response too, but I also wonder how much this has to do with items being sent to non-Japanese in military areas. There&#039;s so much mail coming into Japan every day how could they possibly be totally on &quot;lock down&quot;? <br /><br />I&#039;m very curious about the mail scanning procedures here, but Japanese people in-the-know don&#039;t exactly talk about such things online. <br /><br />Definitely most important:&nbsp; Have a custom package made!

				Here&#039;s some info I&#039;ve found. It&#039;s direct from Japanese Customs&#039; homepage, but useful nonetheless:<br /><br />Customs YouTube video in English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7PxU3yeoEw&amp;<br /><br />Statistics on major seizures each year: http://www.customs.go.jp/tokyo/english/iio/iio-top.htm<br /><br />Yearly reports on smuggling: http://www.customs.go.jp/english/enforcement/index.htm<br /><br />Obviously propaganda from their side, but not much independent info is available!

				If any vendors have experience shipping to Japan it would be great to know anything that you don&#039;t feel compromises SR and your business. <br /><br />I&#039;ve made three small purchases, two of which have arrived and I&#039;m waiting confidently for the 3rd. Will update on my experience once it&#039;s done. <br /><br />HOWEVER, I gotta say that I&#039;ve been less than impressed with the packaging from a couple of big vendors. Please, any vendor shipping to Japan, you have to really up your game. Image is everything here....just make it look businesslike and it&#039;ll be much smoother. I would be more than willing to pay extra for some proper stealth.

				Update from my side:<br /><br />I made three orders at the same time to Japan with my name on them, sent to my office. No problems getting through, but I would have serious reservations for the next order. <br /><br />1) 5 blotters from Juergen:<br />Great outer packaging, but too easy to open, and not vacuum sealed (plastic only). In this case I&#039;m more worried about keeping the product fresh, but still. Probably no big deal to send to Japan. 1 week delivery. <br /><br /><br />2) 5g Culero hash from Emerald:<br />Got it, but damn if it didn&#039;t look shady as hell. I can&#039;t believe it made it in from Spain, and was comically packed inside. I wish I could show you all, but it was too silly to be realistic. Double vacuumed, but that wouldn&#039;t make much of a difference were someone to xray or open the thing. 2 weeks delivery. <br /><br /><br />3) 5 skulls from XTCEXPRESS:<br />Once the culero made it through I felt much better about this order, but it took quite a while (almost 1 month). However, it was packed perfectly and was a great surprise in my mailbox. <br /><br />So, not much feedback except that yes you can order to Japan, BUT it&#039;s very important to do your due diligence and go with vendors that are known for professionalism and understand your market. The best thing to do is make everything look as businesslike as possible. <br /><br />For those of us in Asia it would be a major benefit to have some kind of packaging rating system in SR that lets us get an idea of what real &quot;stealth&quot; is. XTCEXPRESS was great, but I bet there&#039;s even better ones out there. <br /><br /><br />
