				So UnWizard is now selling Organic Absinthe but would like you help in selecting the perfect &quot;sample size bottles for sale&quot;<br />The Absinthe is 144 proof so a little goes a long way, but would you like to see 1 oz. or 2 oz. or 4 oz. sample sized bottles?<br />Please let me know in this thread!<br />Vendor Page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ab4ddb3f26

				Fantastic, I will put up samples next week. Is it proper to charge full shipping/bottling costs on samples or is it community accepted to give away free samples?

				great!!<br /><br />its your choice you are the one with the samples:) i think you&#039;ll get more serious inquires when you charge for shipping<br /><br />instead of everyone on SR hitting you up for &quot;free&quot; samples that they probably wont even write a review on<br /><br />just my opinion

It depends on the costs of your packaging. If you can ship it cheaply then giving your samplers a full-freebie is nice and won&#039;t dig into your pockets too hard. If it costs a lot, then you should be asking for some shipping costs, but possibly give larger samples with that.<br /><br />As for sampling size, and without knowing much about absinthe, I would suggest 2oz as the perfect sweet-spot. 4oz if you end up having to ask for help with the shipping costs.

				Thank you for the input, I will probably just charge the cost for the shipping, box, and bottle but include the product at no cost at all.<br />I may also offer 2 or 3 completely free samples for the lucky few who spot them first ; )

				Sample bottles are now available!<br />All Absinthe is now available shipped to USA, Canada, and EU!<br />Check out the potion shop and order a sample or a nice big bottle to quench that thirst for adventure!
