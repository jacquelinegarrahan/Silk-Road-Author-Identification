				Sorry I just cannot find this information (not that I haven&#039;t spent any time looking), so please don&#039;t tell me to RTFM, but just tell me where it is.<br /><br />How much does it cost to open a seller account, what are the current fees and how much does the hedging cost?

				Thanks.<br />I&#039;ve read it all.<br />I already know that I need $150 to open the account and that the hedging costs ~4%.<br /><br />But I still don&#039;t know what is the commissions that SR takes for the escrow.<br />My bookkeeper needs this information before deciding if we can afford to pay $150 for the account. ;)

				SR commission is 10% I think.<br /><br />Why do you say your &quot;bookkeeper&quot; if you had a book keeper then you would have $150. Always wondered why vendors on SR have a need to pretend they are part of a large nefarious network of criminals when most people are sole traders, which would be the most appropriate set up in this particular line of work and actually increases operational security.

Or how quickly it will pay back...<br /><br />So thanks for your comment, but &quot;I think&quot; is not enough for me.<br />Also because, I think, I once saw a thread on the forum (which I cannot find anymore) about the &quot;new fees&quot; and they were sort of changing as the volume was growing...

				Is that per item or once you have sold that amount?<br /><br />E.g. I sell 100 x $10 sales, am i paying 10% on every sale or will the %&nbsp; decrease with each bracket I hit so that my 101st sale attracts a fee of 1.5%?

				sounds like a cop to me! Find out for yourself! You claim you&#039;re a &quot;bookkeeper&quot;, so you know all about winning and losing. It&#039;&#039;s just a part of the game.
