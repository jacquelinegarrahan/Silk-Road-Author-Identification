				I tried in two threads to start one and I&#039;m not even a vendor.&nbsp; Just a pot fan with a huge purchase history.. . <br />Got shot down. .&nbsp; told its up to Admin and DPR&nbsp; stay out of it. . .&nbsp; &nbsp; its a scam.&nbsp; &nbsp;you are a scammer. . etc. . ..&nbsp; &nbsp;tony76 ?&nbsp; Tony75, tony 74. whatever.. . <br /><br />Started a meeting and agenda, with a task list and looking for volunteers. . . . <br /><br />Saw some others try again too.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People can&#039;t organize anything here.&nbsp; Nobody will follow anybody and everyone is afraid of scams. ..&nbsp; hehe. .&nbsp; <br /><br />It would take serious leadership to get it off the ground without everyone crying foul or scam or all the time.

				There absolutely neeeeeds to be a 420 sale.&nbsp; how can we just ignore this day at this time in history.&nbsp; We need to come together as a community and recognize this day.... not only to get great bud everywhere at a reasonable price, but also to celebrate the importance of this God given herb.
