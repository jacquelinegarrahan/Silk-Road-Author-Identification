				Ok so i am new and it seems Tor is not safe enough as security is increasing.....big time vendors(trustworthy ones) seem to be going to PGP which is some sort of encrypted letter where you must also send a key..(120 bucks a month??? is there a free encryption software online) so my questions are<br /><br />1.not being a computer wiz whats all the basic security programs that i must have? the common ones.... hopefully the are free!!! (I have Tor..obviously thats it<br /><br />2.Bitcoins...what is the process you go to get them? get a money pak and have em sent straight to your SR account to avoid having to move them all around to hide where they end up going?? do you NEED a ewallet??<br /><br />3. Can i contact buyers using th SR PM people like pharmville, it says you can email his coutermail..can i use a hotmail or gmail account to order? can i just add to cart and check out soooooooooooo lost<br /><br />3. WHAT IS THE STANDARD SET UP I SHOULD HAVE JUST TO BE A CUSTOMER... this seems overwhelming and completely confusing for a newbie (standard security, standard why of contacting, best way to get bitcoin, best way to safely just get what i want pretty much<br />

				1. Use tor, if you are more paranoid, run it on a virtual machine and through a proxy.<br />2. Buy bitcoins through an exchange, mtgox, intersango etc. Store them in a bitcoin wallet or just in your SR wallet if you don&#039;t have too many of them.<br />3. Yes, use SR PM but you can just add your item to cart and check out. We don&#039;t use hotmail or gmail, we never use paypal. If you are security conscious then use PGP for PMs. There are free PGP programs. Practice using PGP by sending messages to yourself before doing it IRL.<br />3&#039;. Buy Bitcoins from exchange &gt; wallet &gt; SR. Buy item. Have item delivered. <br /><br />(4). Read as much as you can about Bitcoin, PGP, VM&#039;s etc before you take the plunge. Buy a few cheapo items first like a couple of ebooks to get comfortable using the interface. Newbie questions can sometimes sound a bit LE&#039;esque.

There are tons of different programs available for free that work with the PGP protocol. Go download GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), it&#039;s one of the simplest to use.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8992.msg81780#msg81780">Quote from: iheartpills on January 15, 2012, 08:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">can i use a hotmail or gmail account to order?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No no no nonononono a thousand million billion times no. If you&#039;re gonna buy through SR, try to keep your messages going through SR. If you absolutely must communicate off-site (e.g. if the site is down) use TorPM, or an anonymous e-mail service like Tormail or Lavabit. And for the love of Wotan, only access your e-mail through Tor and encrypt your messages.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8992.msg81780#msg81780">Quote from: iheartpills on January 15, 2012, 08:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you lost me here pal.....whats a virtual machine and proxy<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Google is your friend. You&#039;ve got to learn to research stuff for yourself, son. Don&#039;t expect us to hold your hand through all this, SR ain&#039;t that kind of place. You&#039;re acting mighty suspicious wanting to know how everything works without taking even five minutes to try figuring it out on your own.

				Hi iheartpills, and welcome to the Silk Road.<br /><br />In the future, it&#039;s far more efficient to ask ONE question in a thread, and put that as best you can in the title - &#039;please read&#039; doesn&#039;t tell anyone what to expect. &#039;How do I find a PGP program that doesn&#039;t cost $100&#039; would be a great title, and limit the thread to that one subject.<br /><br />You&#039;ll get a better range of answers, and it will be easier for other newbs in the future to find the information they want in yours and similar threads.<br /><br />Do a lot of lurking and reading - check out the wiki - and use the search function on the forums; couple that with creating more focused threads to ask about things you don&#039;t understand will have you an expert here in no time, telling newbs the same thing ;)<br /><br />Enjoy your stay!
