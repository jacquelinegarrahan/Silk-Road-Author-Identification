				you are taking a risk either way. i withdrew to an IW yesterday and it hasn&#039;t shown up. my advice is to just spend it right away.&nbsp; luckily it wasnt a lot like some of the hits some of the vendors are taking.

				I think all vendors are probably going to cancel orders until straighten out. Or they should unless they want to risk losing money.

				Are they disappearing only when you withdraw them?<br /><br />Then it makes sense to leave them be. Why withdraw now, when withdraw now = loss?* <br /><br />*presuming the rumors are true.
