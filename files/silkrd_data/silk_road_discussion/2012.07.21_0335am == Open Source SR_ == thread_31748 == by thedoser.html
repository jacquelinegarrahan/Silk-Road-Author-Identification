				you always have to rely on yourself for properly encrypting everything and not sending cleartext messages and persona information.<br /><br />as somebody else pointed out this is just a multivendor software with an forum attached and btc integrated.<br /><br />What DPR and crew do is making it fast despite tor...moving it often I assume..organizing the mixing of coins..harden the server as much as possible..and keeping their heads :) and for that they deserve their ration absolutely..

				Luis, PHP is by far one of the most exploited languages out there. It&#039;s not that PHP by itself is inherently insecure but most developers copy &amp; paste insecure code because PHP offers you 100 ways to do the same thing, and 99 out of 100 of them are begging to be exploited.<br /><br />Multiple people including myself have begged SR staff to shut off error reporting, its the most handy tool you can provide a hacker, in fact its how most exploit gets their information back, through error reporting. It&#039;s a shame to see that it apparently is still on for public viewing.

Some of them were not traced, because they used isolation that the police could not break out of (pretty sure they were using virtualbox for isolation actually, although of course hardware or paravirtualization or OS virtualization are better as was discussed at length in other threads).<br /><br />Not a failure of Tor in these cases but a failure of the people who ran those sites to keep them fully patched. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well, sure. However, good hardening practices include the assumption that the box can be compromised (if not already so), and configure it as such -- just like we assumed someone having root in the host (and chflag&#039;ed accordingly.) The chances of &quot;leaking&quot; identifying information are greater from the guest OS to VirtualBox than they are from a jail to the host that is properly locked down. In addition, it adds an extra obfuscation layer that an attacker would have to break through. Root access in a jail is fairly useless. They can&#039;t make any permanent system modifications, nor read any additional system data that a normal user couldn&#039;t. They can&#039;t even see the current firewall ruleset. They can read other user&#039;s homedir data -- but just like the real operator of this service, an attacker would have no information available to determine identity.<br /><br />Some other things to set up:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bump up the LoginGraceTime in the sshd config, since Tor is slow.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Add automatic shell history removal to /etc/csh.logout and /etc/profile, depending on if the default shell is tcsh or bash, respectively.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Add a reasonable hostname to /etc/hosts for 127.0.0.2.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Disable adjkerntz in /etc/crontab -- time is set from the host.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe precreate a bunch of users? If you&#039;re invited to a shell server by a pal, and there is only one other account... that would be an identity leak.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Install any additional ports/packages you want to offer from the shell. I like ntalk/ytalk!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; How about a quick script for creating new accounts? Maybe linked to a guest account for anonymous creations?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am pretty sure soon SR will run on some Raspberry PI behind hidden walls in cracked cable lans within virtualbox :)<br /><br /><br />

It&#039;s not that PHP by itself is inherently insecure but most developers copy &amp; paste insecure code because PHP offers you 100 ways to do the same thing, and 99 out of 100 of them are begging to be exploited.<br /><br />Multiple people including myself have begged SR staff to shut off error reporting, its the most handy tool you can provide a hacker, in fact its how most exploit gets their information back, through error reporting. It&#039;s a shame to see that it apparently is still on for public viewing. Ideally you don&#039;t have any exploits at all, but making the hacker work with the same &quot;error occurred&quot; message makes their job a lot tougher and sometimes even impossible to be useful. <br /><br />Some links discussing securing a PHP applicaiton.<br /><br />http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/5-helpful-tips-for-creating-secure-php-applications/<br />https://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/744/secure-php-with-configuration-settings/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not totally sure it&#039;s fair to say that PHP is one of the most exploited languages, it just happens to be one that a ton of websites are authored in and as such become what gets exploited.&nbsp; It&#039;s no more open to exploits than any other language for the most part.<br /><br />Joomla etc are all terrible examples, just because they&#039;re written in PHP isn&#039;t a reflection of the language but just poor code quality in many cases.&nbsp; In more than a decade, I&#039;ve found a fair share of exploits in scripts, and to date none of mine have ever been exploited.&nbsp; With a stable grasp of security, it&#039;s really all about what data the user sends and making sure to sanitize it.&nbsp; If you have EVERYTHING that comes from the user mistrusted, then by default you go out of your way to intval(), mysql_real_escape_string() etc everything and it becomes very very difficult to find large, worthwhile exploits.<br /><br />In terms of SR, if you #1 use PGP for every message and #2 don&#039;t keep money sitting around in your account for a period of time and #3 remove your messages etc... I honestly don&#039;t know much damage could really harm users.&nbsp; You can&#039;t decrypt my messages, you can&#039;t spend my money, you can&#039;t read my past history of purchases and messaging easily... beyond that I really hope DPR and his crew know their stuff.&nbsp; Open source though is just a problem waiting to happen, perhaps independent security audits by a few people with the right security knowledge would be a better idea.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31748.msg366187#msg366187">Quote from: Bungee54 on July 24, 2012, 02:45 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">SQL injections are easy to stop arent they?<br /><br />Just set SQL to EXACT VALUES and accept nothing else?<br /><br /><br />I am in no way equpped with knowlege in those matters...just assumed&nbsp; :o<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you run EVERY piece of user data through mysql_real_escape_string() you should be 100% safe from MySQL injection.&nbsp; There is one scenario in a specific character set where they can send 2 characters together that gets parsed as a single quote (&#039;) instead, and the whole issue revolves around making sure single quotes are replaced by \&#039; so MySQL knows where your string starts and stops vs thinking it stopped mid string and reading the rest of the string as more command (vs data storing to a column).&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s really not very difficult, any exploit that relies on it is probably due to lazy programming.&nbsp; I get super paranoid when it comes to sql injection, and even variables I KNOW are integers I sanitize once more JUST TO BE CERTAIN NO ONE FUCKED WITH CODE BETWEEN THE INITIAL VARIABLE AS A NUMBER AND WHEN I USE IT IN THE DATABASE.&nbsp; If you follow those rules, I&#039;d dare say you can&#039;t go very wrong.

				After doing some analysis of the Silk Road website, it looks like they&#039;re using the CodeIgniter PHP framework on the backend.
