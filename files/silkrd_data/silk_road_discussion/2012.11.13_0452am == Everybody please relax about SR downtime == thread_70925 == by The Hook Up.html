				The silkroad is offline for sometime, and there is chaos on SR forums which i have to say is ridiculous. I understand why you guys might worry. Im sure the vendors are worried bout their bitcoins, and selling their product, while buyers are worried bout their bitcoins in the accounts and receiving their goods. Also worries about the security. There is no point in creating different scenarios on what might have happened, it won&#039;t change anything. I suggest everybody comes down and waits for the next few days, and im sure the silkroad will be running as smoothly as it always does after this downtime. This stuff happens, give Silkroad crew a break, and let them do their job, so you can get to your business sooner. <br /><br />Sorry its not well written, just putting out some thoughts. thanks

				I agree. <br /><br />The forums have exploded like a teenager pumped full of adrenaline. <br /><br />And the most frustrating thing is so many people won&#039;t be patient and they are complaining about DPR words not being true. <br />Well all I can say is, if you could do a better job than what DPR is currently doing, why do you not have a 22mil booming business. <br /><br />Why can&#039;t people just be sensible? <br /><br />
