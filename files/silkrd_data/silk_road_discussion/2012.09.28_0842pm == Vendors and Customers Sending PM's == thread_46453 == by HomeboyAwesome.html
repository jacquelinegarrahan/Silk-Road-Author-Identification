				Hey SR, <br />It&#039;s really not my style to post on the forum. I usually just read it.&nbsp; However, I got the worst/nasty message from a vendor, who happened to have a 100 behind his name. Don&#039;t worry about me, I stopped crying about an hour ago&nbsp; ;). Anyways, I didn&#039;t do shit to the guy; he messed up my order; so I made him aware of it. I was overly respectful in my communication with him. Naturally,&nbsp; I expected that same tone in return.&nbsp; I won&#039;t tell you all the vendors name but it rhymes with Papadurf1. I just want to throw it out there, to the vendors and consumers, to be respectful and cordial in&nbsp; your communications.&nbsp; SR is a great place, and there&#039;s no need for that kind of bullshit. Really how tough can we be online?

				I cant see a problem with a buyer (or vendor) raising an issue they have, as long as it&#039;s based solely on the facts. If we all treat each other as we would want to be treated ourselves, the world would be a much better place. It&#039;s so simple to do.&nbsp; ;D

				Thanks a lot for taking the time to share that information HBA, much appreciated.&nbsp; Besides the nasty reply, has the vendor whose name rhymes with Papadurf1 taken care of the order mistake to your satisfaction?&nbsp; Like you an Wadozo said, there&#039;s no need for that kind of behavior on here, golden rule should rule..

				No he didn&#039;t. I actually told him to take a hike essentially, because I didn&#039;t want to deal with him anymore.&nbsp; It was about a $50 dollar loss on my part.
