				The title says it all -- I&#039;ve been doing a lot of research into the field and past the obvious (wearing gloves / no fingerprints, concealed shipping, etc.) are there any precautionary measures that should be taken that aren&#039;t so obvious? Just afraid I might be overlooking something, thanks for your help.

				Well, you should check a real ID against your &#039;novelty ID&#039; with a UV/blacklight. Or did I misunderstand your question?

				Are you going to be offering fake ID&#039;s on SR?&nbsp; Because I would be very interested in getting one if it all stays in escrow.

				I think your critical problem is this:<br /><br />The buyer will have a hard time denying he ordered your novelty ID when his/her face is printed on it.<br />So, interception is of pivotal importance. While drug vendors can lose the occasional package, it&#039;s more problematic for you.<br /><br />Some ways around this include:<br /><br />- having some way for the buyer to easily change/alter the picture. A plastic coating enveloping the card with a superimposed face would be ideal, and should take a significant scratch at the side to peel off.<br />- having multiple decoy IDs, all of which are obviously fake &#039;novelty&#039; IDs, except for 1 real one.
