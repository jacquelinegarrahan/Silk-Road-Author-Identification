				When I first joined SR i believed that many people with a lot posts here knew what they were talking about. But for all of you noobs out there looking for advice, many of these people with a high post count have simply been on the forums for a long time. Not many people here are experts. I have seen some pretty dumbass comments that I know from personal experience that are wrong. I would also like to point out the &quot;scientific facts&quot; people quote are often made up, or found from some bull shit article. In the long run what I am trying to say is, trust no one person on this website. At a minimum go with a majority of the people think because we have no guarantee that anyone here knows what they are talking about.<br />I remember one post about drug testing that really pissed me off. This one kid couple have failed his drug test from some full on retarded advice.<br /><br />PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE INFO YOU READ.

				Um,&nbsp; everyone here is on drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d Remind you.&nbsp; &nbsp;If they are not high, them they wish they were or trying to.&nbsp; Either way taking advice from a Internet form is always a bad idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are jelous people here who get a laugh at seeing people pointed the wrong direction.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s kinda like picking on the younger ones because you knowing here are underage and shouldn&#039;t be talking to adults.&nbsp; &nbsp;Especially about drugs.&nbsp; That&#039;s just me though <br /><br /><br />They got good books at the library.&nbsp; Grab one.

				It&#039;s a fact:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; There are vendors selling information and consultation here.&nbsp; Any free consultation is competition stealing business from information vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.&nbsp; Not saying its happening but its possible that vendors use fake accounts to mislead others in hopes they get frustrated and just pay for the info from a vendor selling it instead <br /><br />3.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sales and marketplace website.&nbsp; Everything is for sale.&nbsp; You get what you pay for. <br /><br /><br />If you want good information that is accountable, buy it from someone who is actually an expert.&nbsp; Consultation is gold when it comes from someone with references.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen a lot of noobs (I know most people would consider me a noob too) asking silly questions on the forums in recent weeks. It must be a sign of the growing knowledge of SR to the masses. Noobs will ask questions that obviously you shouldn&#039;t be asking in public and would never receive a straight answer in public. Not only that, they are looking for free advice that would normally costs tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. I know I also ask for a lot of advice about tech issues in the security forums. But the marketplace for tech advice is generally free and open source. I do my initial research and then ask a question to get me past a hurdle. <br /><br />The noobs who are asking silly questions on the forums don&#039;t take this approach. They sign up for a forum account, post 50 spams, then ask, how do I import 40Kilos of coke, or how do I disappear off the face of the earth or how do I pass a drug test on my high school basketball team. GTFO. If you are stupid enough to ask stupid questions, then you should be bombarded with silly responses or scams to teach you a lesson. I remember I posted in someone&#039;s thread about passing a drug test. I suggested they should piss in a camelback. Hey if you are stupid enough to blindly follow a silly suggestion like that without any thought or more in depth research, and you get caught, then I just consider that as thinning out the herd. Stop being a noob and learn something about business. The market for business information is NEVER free. The first rule in business is that no one does anything for anyone without getting something in return.

				I don&#039;t get why the newbie discussion is&nbsp; allowed to be filled with rush spam and not used correctly as a introduction to Silk Road currently it breeds incompetence in the forum.<br />That develops in to dangerous scenarios and is basically causing more harm than good. The Spamming also promotes a post topic first research it later style when rushing to get a post number is retarded in the broad spectrum.<br />The search function has at least 90% of newb question threads a half dozen times.<br />Online Experts in my mind are experts of what online says is correct.not a factual but more of a perspective view.

				I mean, the original post speaks the truth.. and I suppose that such reminders are a good thing; But its like jedi said. This is an anon forum populated with junkies, tweakers, stoners, cokeheads, scammers, assholes, cops... you get the picture. Many of these people are at best intermittently helpful. <br />Drug brains aside, there are far too many people here now to assume that everyone is going to be one big happy clandestine family of helpful veterans who only post when its constructive. ignorant people are a side effect of SR growth that we can only accept. <br /><br />You should know off the bat to take the words here with a grain of salt. That actually goes for any forum on tor or otherwise. Life lessons are always hard learned. If you&#039;re too stupid to know that then you deserve to piss in a camelback. <br />Idk, just my thoughts&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />
