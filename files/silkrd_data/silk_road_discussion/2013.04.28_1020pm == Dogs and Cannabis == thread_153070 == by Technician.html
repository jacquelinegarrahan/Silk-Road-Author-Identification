				Just trying to get everyone&#039;s first hand experiences or opinions on the matter. I have read mixed reviews from my google researching and I have limited experience in doing this myself. My dog hates smoke so I have never blown it in her face but I did give her a roach&nbsp; just right now and she just straight ate it and seemed to like it, I gave her a stem right after and she would not stop going for my bag after that lol now she&#039;s asleep, I guess I&#039;ll see if she&#039;s buzzed once she wakes up.<br /><br />And to those PETA, tree huggers out there please spare me, we cut off our dogs reproduction in order to domesticate them, a little marijuana that she was not forced to eat will not hurt her at all.

				Apparently, not all mammals respond to cannabis. Like cannabinoid receptors are not in all animals, or their brains don&#039;t have the parts that react to cannabis. Brains are too small .&nbsp; Some not all. <br /><br />At any rate I doubt it&#039;s harmful.&nbsp; I k ow a few dogs that take doggie lorazapam (Ativan) for heir nerves and another dog that has a Codiene prescription for pain.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I guess they respond to some meds. Maybe cannabis too. Mold arthritic dogs would love some weed for inflammation and pain. Especially in the mornings.&nbsp;

				Interesting topic. My dog doesn&#039;t seem to react to it at all, she&#039;s been in pretty heavily smoke filled spaces around people getting high many times but behaves no differently in those situations than normally. I think my dog likes the smell of weed though because she will come find me and curiously sniff around if I open up a jar of weed or if someone&#039;s rolling some up, packing a bowl, and so on.&nbsp; Sometimes my dog has eaten nugs that fell on the floor, but again they didn&#039;t have any noticeable effect as far as the dog getting high or whatever.

				Dogs and cats get very high on a very small amount of vaporized synthetic cannabinoids to the point where they cannot walk or cannot walk properly.&nbsp; I have seen it first hand.&nbsp; I saw a cats legs keep spreading out and the cat kept falling over every time it got up.&nbsp; I&#039;m not claiming to be the one who conducted this experiment but i did see it first hand.

				Yeah I have had people try to talk shit to me when talking about getting dogs high but I won&#039;t force them to take something unless they&#039;re just docile about it or appear to be enjoying themselves. I know that THC isn&#039;t equally as pleasing to everyone, the last thing I want is for my dog to not be enjoying herself or freaking out because she doesn&#039;t know what&#039;s going on. I just know that when I&#039;m sitting here breaking up my weed and she comes up wagging her tail, I know she wants some of that shit, so of course I&#039;m going to share some love.
