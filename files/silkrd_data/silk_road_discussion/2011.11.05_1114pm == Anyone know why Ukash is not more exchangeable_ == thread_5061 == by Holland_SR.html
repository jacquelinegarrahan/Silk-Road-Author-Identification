				<br />Many people want to pay with Ukash, it is available in many many stores here. A simple 19 digit code that can represent hundreds of dollars easily. On the Ukash sites, codes can be changed, combined, split etc.<br /><br />But I cant find any place to exchange it to LR or something without losing 25%.<br />Any idea why this difference is so big? Seem pretty secure as a store of cash.<br /><br />I did hear you can fund BTC-e through Interkassa, but Interkassa is in Russian and seems to be more of a webshop payment system.<br /><br />Too bad I already took in quite a lot ;)

				I&#039;m not Russian, but Google is a great translator!&nbsp; :P&nbsp; If you notice most e-currency exchanges charge higher fees for services that use convenient&nbsp; and instant payment methods.&nbsp; Paypal, VISA/MC and uKash all have fairly strict charge-back methods which is why many exchanges place a higher fee on these transactions.<br /><br />If you go down the btc-e.com/Interkassa route, you will lose about 10% in fees when the transaction is processed with Wallet-1.

				Be careful going down this Interkassa/BTC-E.COM route with Ukash.<br /><br />The first 2 times I used the Ukash convertor to change from my home currency into EURO&#039;s with no probs (as that it what is needed to finalise the transaction).<br /><br />The third time I did this Ukash gave me a voucher code that Interkasaa would not accept.<br /><br />I&#039;m now in the back &amp; forth routine of trying to figure out what was wrong the the Ukash voucher I was given and why Interkassa won&#039;t accept it.<br /><br />A lot of what I have to deal with is in Russian so that triples the difficulty.<br /><br />Just be careful as it seems that the Ukash voucher codes are not all the same. At this point it seems that digit #9 of the voucher code could indicate an area when voucher have problems. The previous 2 vouchers that worked perfectly had a digit #9 as a 1 or a 2. This third (dud) voucher has digit #9 as a 5.<br /><br />All I&#039;m saying is Ukash has it&#039;s problems like most other methods. :(

I could never understand why there were so many options for the EUR currency and perhaps I chose one that is a &#039;trouble&#039; EUR currency (if that makes any sense?).<br /><br />I&#039;ll make sure I&#039;ll always use the &quot;Euro - EUR&quot; option in future. Now thinking about I did choose the EURO-EUR option on my first two conversions but may have chosen a different one on the 3rd voucher (the dud voucher), something like Austria-EUR, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m stll pretty annoyed at Ukash - as they are giving me the run around - meanwhile I have a bunch of EURO&#039;s just floating around somewhere unable to be used. :(<br /><br />Also, Interkassa/Wallet1 could make it clearer what is and isn&#039;t an acceptable Ukash voucher currency.<br />

				I&#039;ve been writing and writing to Ukash but they are so evasive. They even give you a feedback ticket number but is seems to have no bearing on the anything apart from make them look official. I quote my feedback number and some are confused, some have no record. I just don&#039;t know what is going on with that place.<br /><br />My &#039;dud&#039; voucher is worth 36.27 EUR so if anyone has any way of helping me turn that into BTC I&#039;ll offer a generous commission.<br /><br />So, anyway, I went out again yesterday and bought 2 more Ukash vouchers only to find that Ukash has now taken down their toolkit so I can&#039;t convert, join, split, anything.<br /><br />This quagmire is just getting deeper and deeper.<br /><br />They claim they are doing maintenance on the toolkit (with a 2-week time-frame) which seems long in any language so for the time being it looks like I&#039;m stuck with over $100 of Ukash vouchers when I could be snapping up cheap BTC&#039;s....<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s actually a real shame because it is such a great system. There nearest shop that can issue Ukash vouchers is only like 5 mins (if that) away.<br />
