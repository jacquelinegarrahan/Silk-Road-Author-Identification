				I haven&#039;t seen a thread started on this yet so I guess I&#039;ll be the one to start it. I got a message from &quot;ezecoca&quot; with the subject as &quot;important&quot;. Here&#039;s the message I received: <br /><br />&quot;sell cocaine, high purity from the factory, PERU, price per gram:<br /><br />Cocaine:<br />3.5 g for $192.5 (55.00$/g)<br />5 g for $250 (50.00$/g)<br />7 g for $336 (48.00$/g)<br /><br />contacts:<br /><br />User: SR pepinamil<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d45414deec&quot;<br /><br />I checked that URL and it appears to actually be a vendor on SR. Maybe this guy is another investment scammer...? Idk but PMing a bunch of people like that is not the way to go no matter what. That&#039;s just bad business IMO. We have a &quot;product offers&quot; section for a reason.

				I&#039;m gonna assume if you made an order he&#039;d message you asking what weight you want, along with a bitcoin address to send additional coins to. That way he avoids SR resolution center.

				I, for one, will definitely not be ordering from him. I know other people got this message. I&#039;d appreciate it if they came forward to second this vendor&#039;s shady-ness.

				I would not be to hasty, I think this guy is legit. There is an obvious risk of ordering from this location, but at that price you can&#039;t complain. from my communication with the seller I can confirm that the guy is located in Peru, he came to me before he had a SR account saying he would soon be a vendor and true to his word he was within a couple of weeks. I have got a small sample order with him and I have tracking number that states the origin and location of the package. The is no need to be so harsh to new vendors, coming from Peru, he prob has a lot more to gain from a site like SR than he might selling on the streets. I have faith, and hope this guy comes through to be a great seller, as everyone has to start somewhere. I will let you guys know the outcome in about a week from now when it arrives (or not).
