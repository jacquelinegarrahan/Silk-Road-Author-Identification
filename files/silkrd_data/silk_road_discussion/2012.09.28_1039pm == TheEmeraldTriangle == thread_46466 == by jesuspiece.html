I&#039;ve only bought their outdoor strains since I try to keep my costs low and pass the savings on to my friends I sell to. Their outdoor strains are still top shelf as far as I&#039;m concerned, and I do 4-6 bowls a day pretty easily. All my orders have arrived between .5-1g overweight, and it&#039;s never taken me more than 5 days to get my order from them once it&#039;s been marked in transit. They&#039;re top notch, you can&#039;t go wrong ordering from them.

				I just got an order of the outdoor Strawberry Cough from them a few days ago. Shipping got delayed, but they addressed it. It still didn&#039;t take that long anyway. Packaging was professional looking. As far as the bud, sweet and earthy is the best way I could describe the smell I think, but not overly impressive. The amount/size of trichromes wasn&#039;t bad, but again, not impressive. One thing that was visually impressive was the density of the buds. You can tell whoever grew this had an idea about how to get it to grow to its full potential as far as size is concerned. When I smoked it though, all the concerns I had during the initial visual inspection were quickly forgotten. It&#039;s a really energetic, mood enhancing high(just like strawberry cough is supposed to be.) This stuff can definitely compete with a lot of peoples indoor shit, maybe not some of the other big(ger) vendors on SR(or their own I&#039;m sure,) but its definitely on par with a casual growers shit. In other words, it was WELL worth the money. Seriously.

				Wow! Thanks everyone for the high marks. We much appreciate it!<br /><br />BTW: It seems some of our listings have been hit with the &quot;Quickbuy&quot; button thing. It seems that the regular shipping options still exist, so PLEASE USE THEM! DON&#039;T use the Quickbuy thing until DPR makes some sort of announcement about what the hell it is and what&#039;s going on with it.<br /><br />Happy Holidays everyone!<br /><br />P.S. Our last pre-Xmas shipping day is this Friday, the 21st. Our next shipping day will be December 26th.

				For everyone&#039;s information: The defacing done by the &quot;Quickbuy&quot; hack has been fixed. The shipping options are back so your orders will be accepted.

				&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Review:Sour Diesel<br /><br />Appearance:5/5<br />&nbsp;Super nice look, with bright emerald color, the green we all grew up to love. Forthe product being &quot;outdoor&quot; it&#039;s workmanship on the quality is nothing short of impeccable <br />Image link: (http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=a8dded105414d2784dec11ff71e01e75.jpg)<br /><br />Smell: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Loud smell ! For &quot;outdoor&quot; it blows it out the water from other high grade quality stuff they call &quot;dro&quot; when its probably grown quick stressed conditions mid grade at most appeal. The aroma has a fuely gas scent that of &quot;diesel&quot; thats grown to be loved because of that aspect, the &quot;fuelish&quot; or diesel taste this batch of cannabis is extremly aromatic<br /><br />Taste: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Super strong intake, almost like a sharp skunk sativa&#039; this is where the taste of the &quot;diesel&quot; is apparent. the strain has been isolated to capture this extreme taste. Unique to all !<br /><br />Effect: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Super dreamy and expressive, potent for taste and smell overall lastin&#039; memory.<br /><br />Packaging/Shipping: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Priority Shipping , awesome time recieved . 3 days<br /><br />Cost:5/5<br />&nbsp;The quality is awesome for a ounce at about 250 dollars????<br />. Beats buyin&#039; grams of da street all day !!! <br />The quality is over the edge , and can go toe for toe on gram sales of &quot;dro&quot; on the street<br /><br /><br />Overall: 6/5<br />Super Stanky super Pretty, and plain ol&#039; super GOOD !

				My order from ET came in today. I thought I&#039;d give a review similar to metaphoe&#039;s<br /><br />Review: G13<br /><br />Appearance:5/5<br />&nbsp;Nugs are dark Emerald Green with dark red hairs. Smaller overall than my last order, what you&#039;d call &quot;popcorn&quot; nugs. Still dense and fluffy, gave my grinder a bit of trouble. As usual it was around 3/4-1g overweight.<br /><br />Smell: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Very pungent, piney smell to it. I transferred it into a mason jar after opening. Could still smell lingering hints of the scent several minutes after sealing and storing it.<br /><br />Taste: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Kind of hard to describe how it tastes, but it&#039;s a very smooth and pleasant smoke.<br /><br />Effect: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Nice dreamy, introspective head high, with a slight body tingle.<br /><br />Packaging/Shipping: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Standard triple vac seal. Very stealthy and got here quickly. I ordered late Thursday night, it got here Monday. My package usually arrives within 3-4 days. The longest I&#039;ve ever had to wait to get an order from ET is 6 days, and that was due to the holiday shipping delays.<br /><br />Cost:5/5<br />$230 including shipping for an ounce of top shelf Cannabis. Pretty fucking hard to beat that price. <br /><br />Overall: 10/5<br />Emerald Triangle has hands down been the best Cannabis vendor I&#039;ve ever bought from on here. Even though they and Pot 2 Peer are/were in the same network, I find ET&#039;s product more impressive, no offense meant to P2P. Their prices are the best on the Road for a U.S. buyer in my opinion, and their 100% satisfaction rating speaks for itself. Aside from becoming friends with a grower or growing it yourself, I can&#039;t think of a better way to get your Cannabis fix.
