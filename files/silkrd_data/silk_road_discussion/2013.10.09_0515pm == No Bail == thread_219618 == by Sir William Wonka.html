He wasn&#039;t &quot;denied bail&quot; (although he will be when they finally have the hearing). He waived his right to bail and agreed to be transported to NY. The bail hearing has been postponed until that time before seeking bail. His lawyer said he would seek bail after being transported.<br /><br />Also, (not included in your link) US attorney&#039;s office has stated that there are no conditions under which they think he should be granted bail, which is not shocking (and is pretty predictable).<br />www.phys.org/news/2013-10-accused-silk-road-mastermind-brig.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: GGGreenbud</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We can still bust him out during his court dates.&nbsp; $80 mil is a hellova lot of money.&nbsp; Not saying I&#039;m going to do it, but someone else might.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Jesus fucking Christ, when&#039;s the last time someone was busted out of a US Federal Detention Center? Since you mentioned the $80 mil, that&#039;s one reason they&#039;ll never grant him bail; they know he&#039;s got it.<br /><br />

That kind of money can also get you a Presidential pardon.<br />Btw, there&#039;s still a good chance he can get bail.

He&#039;s too much of a flight risk. The prosecution will claim he&#039;s a flight risk by pointing to the seriousness of the charges levied against him and the amount of prison time he&#039;s facing and also by pointing to the huge cache of BTC that the government claims he&#039;s got. He doesn&#039;t have very many ties to the community (e.g. few family and friends, no real property and no business interests that would discourage him from permanently leaving the US). They&#039;ll also claim that he&#039;d be a danger to the &quot;community&quot; if released. They&#039;ll paint him as violent and aggressive.<br /><br />My buddy is currently doing 5 years in &quot;Club Fed&quot; for cocaine distribution and a weapons offense. He took a plea bargain, but they had him in custody for 1.5 years before he finally agreed to the plea. He was denied bail, and he was running a MUCH smaller and MUCH more low profile operation than Ulbricht is accused of running. They claimed the whole &quot;danger to the community shit.&quot; Practically every single hearing before he agreed to the plea was postponed. The prosecutors asked for and were granted continuances because they &quot;weren&#039;t prepared to proceed.&quot; They right to a &quot;speedy trial&quot; in federal court is a myth (speedy is in the eye of the beholder). While the federal court system is overloaded and does generally move slowly, prosecutor exploit that as another tool to pressure defendants into agreeing to a plea deal.<br /><br />Anyway, anyone brave enough to give a real name and credit card can view all the filings and motions in the DPR case (that aren&#039;t sealed) by creating an account on pacer dot gov (the CC is need because they charge $0.08 per page -- they only charge you if you read more than $25 worth of documents per quarter).
