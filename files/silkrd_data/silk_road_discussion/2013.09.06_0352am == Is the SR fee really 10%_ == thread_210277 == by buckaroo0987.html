				Someone was saying in a different thread that SR takes 10% of sales for their commission.<br /><br />I&#039;m not knocking or complaining about the SR taking their cut... That makes total sense.<br /><br />Normally that&#039;s not an issue, I&#039;d guess most products here have a 20%+ profit margin....<br /><br />But I&#039;m thinking about the guys in the money section who are taking MP for BTC or selling BTC for cash in the mail and only making 5 or 10% themselves.<br /><br />How are they making any profit?

But i believe he was talking about SR. Which i also believe is an ignorant statement. Is this guy seriously complaining about SR making money? Would he rather there be no SR at all? Seriously. People need to focus more on the benefits offered rather than how much everyone else is making. It really is none of our concern.

				Still a better deal than Amazon&#039;s seller fees: 15% of selling price plus flat fee of USD1.35 per sale plus monthly fee of USD39.99 regardless of sales volume. Even if you could sell drugs on Amazon, you&#039;d still get a better deal on SR.<br /><br />O, and Amazon also reports your earnings to the IRS.

				LOL you would you trippy ass horse. BTW there&#039;s gleaming reviews and discussions of you on reddit&#039;s SR subdomain. I like the look of it to from a creative and not financial analysis standpoint.<br /><br />Regarding Hedging - If you&#039;ve been in the bitcoin game long enough, you ill likely know that there&#039;s more to gain than lose, but never expect speculation to yield guessed results. As of 3 weeks ago I have unhedged my listings and earned 5-20% on most orders. That&#039;s around $300 that would never be in my pocket if I didn&#039;t unhedge. I didn&#039;t do any historical analysis to see what I could&#039;ve gained because I know it&#039;ll piss me off like the fact I was buying BTC for &lt;$5 that went up to $200 a year later. I did gain $3000 profit from the $500 seller bond after 2 months tho :) I was socked. I thought it was gonna be $500 worth of BTC. closest eeling to winning the lottery I&#039;ve got.

I could not tell if he was legit as his transactions are mostly hidden by the new system.<br />Otherwise the money sellers seem to me to have fees (including sr comissions) around 15 to 25%. If you buy coins from vendors for 20% and sell coins to buyers for 15%, there is a lot of money to be made. If you keep it in the SR system, SR probably gets most of it. A lot of money vendors do not do it through SR escrow (as an exception is allowed by SR for that). These vendors can be making a lot of $. If they choose to. they can also scam massivly with their FE based systems. Look at the items the money/btc sellers sell. If they are pretty much free, they are not paying a lot of comission. The &quot;top&quot; $ vendors do keep it in the sysem and that is why SR calculations show them to be &quot;top&quot; vendors.
