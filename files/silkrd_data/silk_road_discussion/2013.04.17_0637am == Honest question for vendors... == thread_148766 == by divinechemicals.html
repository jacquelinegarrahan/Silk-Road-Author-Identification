				I&#039;m pretty drugged up right now so this might sound stupid, but I&#039;m honestly curious: Have you ever looked up your customers on Facebook? I mean you know their names and where they live, it probably wouldn&#039;t be that hard. Obviously you would never friend them or contact them at all, but you ever gotten the urge to see what they look like, what they do, etc.? I don&#039;t know if I could control that urge. I guess that&#039;s why I&#039;m not a vendor&nbsp; ;)

				Oh wow.<br />Good question op. I mean damn.<br />I&#039;m a little fucked up atm as well so this is just like...daaayymnn.<br />I agree with you op. I was the kid that asked &quot;why&quot; about everything so... :/<br /><br />Good catch SpaceWrangler!!<br />Personally, if it was for that purpose, I certainly wouldn&#039;t have a problem.<br />It would be more a violation of my confidential expectations if it were a search (on facebook or what have you) for simply curiosities sake. And my security would well be compromised easily. I&#039;m sure le would love to have a a buyer&#039;s face, name, address, profession, all on the computer in a vendors home with drugs that they sent out and just got busted for. There&#039;s definitely ways of linking both way too easily and simultaneously busting everyone.<br /><br />Thin thin thin thin line.

				99.9% is copy and paste unless it is suspicious.<br />Other than that... no address is ever kept once shipped.&nbsp; <br />I use my own , methods of tracking package to username to save my ass if they decide to play &quot;no show&quot; on me.<br /><br />Once delivered and finalized, I have no idea or even a chance of recovering that info, DCNs do not even exist anymore!

				I&#039;m realizing now that no vendor worth .001 BTC is going to admit to doing this, unless they made a throwaway account or something. I do hope that no vendors are doing this, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a few vendors I&#039;ve bought from have seen my face out of curiosity. It makes me think.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148766.msg1023952#msg1023952">Quote from: rednelb1 on April 17, 2013, 07:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Forgot to mention... outside of SR I have been on both sides of the Facebook/pi/blackmail shit.<br /><br />In the end, smart people make that work.

Your SR username should be exclusive to SR, nothing else, and preferably something that when Googled, produces unrelated results. For example, Divine Chemicals is also the name of several companies around the world, and I don&#039;t use this username anywhere else. Better safe than in jail.

				Not facebook, not interested what or who they are.<br />What I do if I don&#039;t &#039;&#039;trust&#039;&#039; the address....look at Google maps.<br />Several times I found out that it was like a postal/pobox service and one time abandoned house (mailman does not deliver there....)<br />I don&#039;t ship to that kind of addresses because of the red flag for customs.<br />EU vendor and most my orders go to US,&nbsp; Canada etc.<br />After shipping all is destroyed, from pc, labelprinter etc.<br />&nbsp;

				If I didn&#039;t clarify enough, my user name vs a search does not bring up &quot;me&quot;.<br /><br />Being that ever handle on earth is taken, a google search would not turn up the real me..<br /><br />That being said, I have had shit holes scam me and based on their username, was able to pinpoint that person. Likewise, you can never trust 100% of what info a vendor keeps and for how long. Been their and done that.<br /><br />I don&#039;t FB buyers. I don&#039;t Google map, EVER! nothing but copy and paste and delete.<br /><br />Saying I am stupid is wrong. Genius perhaps, insane maybe. it may be that it is be and being blatant is the safest method..... hmmmm...&nbsp; Figure it out yourself.

				No, we destroy everything. We copy and paste nearly all addresses, with minimal editing by adding extra spacing or whatever if needed.<br /><br />Don&#039;t even get me started on all these peeps using clearnet pseudo-identities here. There are still too many.

				The only reason I would do that as a vendor would be if I got a purchase from someone in the current city I live in that I might know, or if I got a purchase from someone in the small city back home that I grew up in.<br /><br />Luckily I&#039;m not a vendor, but my curiosity just could not stop me from doing such.

				I was going to respond to your question...<br /><br />Until I realised I did it when I was blitzed, so I couldn&#039;t remember, but the page loaded now so hey...<br /><br />To repeat: NO - NEVER - EVER<br /><br />Get all your shit out of &quot;big data&quot;. They are keeping it all anyway, just don&#039;t give them anymore. This is doubly true of vendors.<br /><br />(And/Or use disinformation.)<br /><br />You think there aren&#039;t dynamically compiled lists of all the various properties that a vendor or a buyer would be identified by that aren&#039;t extracted from OLAP cubes in massive data warehouses that are updated hourly?<br /><br />UK = Surveillance Capital of World. ANPR, CCTV, Cop-Cams... <br /><br />People only know what you tell them.<br /><br />To use an old hacker quote: &quot;When freedom is outlawed, only outlaws will have freedom.&quot;<br /><br />Don&#039;t try to track your buyers or the vendors, because big data is tracking the fact you are looking for those items. All someone has to do is knit together a set of identifiable traits and...<br /><br />From here, I&#039;ll shut my face, because I wouldn&#039;t want to put the police, ESPECIALLY THE AUSTRALIAN COPS, &quot;one step ahead&quot; in tackling what they perceive the situation to be.<br /><br />One step ahead? Shit, your ozzie cops need to go back to school. You clearly haven&#039;t learned that there are numbers that consist of more than two digits and we could give nearly our whole process to you cops on a plate (to any cops reading of course), and we would STILL be triple digits in steps ahead of you.<br /><br />*sigh* Yes...&nbsp; There are numbers that have more than three digits...<br /><br />Think I need a bifter. Typing way too much tonight.

				Are you serious ..&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t even consider someone who does that a vendor. I thought we were all here with privacy on our minds in the first place.<br /><br />Which serious vendor would do such a thing :/ <br /><br />Big NO. We delete addresses from our encrypted drive when the item gets shipped, and a printed address never lays around longer than needed (maximum 30 miuntes = print -&gt; make package -&gt; ship OUT)

				There is just no interest in doing that, even though I consider myself to be a curious person. Also, I would be very surprised any top 10% would take the time to do this, as doing business on the Road is extremely time consuming. Though as someone mentioned, no serious vendor will ever admit to that as it would scare customers away.

				Don&#039;t know if any of you are or have ever been involved in IT admin for SME/Large Enterprise.<br /><br />Very few of the admins give a fuck what info you have or collect on disc. Many don&#039;t look because the workload is simply so high.<br /><br />Same applies here in many ways.

				Stay the fuck away from facebook regardless of whether you&#039;re a vendor or a buyer. Or even just a lurker. <br /><br />Since they went public, they&#039;ve started to sell peoples data to advertising and video/content seeding companies. Granted, all they want at the moment is to sell you shit - but this is where it starts - and I don&#039;t care to find out where it ends.

The ones I find and confirm I have nothing to do with. Better safe than sorry!!<br /><br />If I ever get caught everyone is fucked! I&#039;m sure LE is doing the same thing but better. SCARED?

				Reading someone&#039;s comment about having an encrypted drive made me cringe a bit because due to the low capacity of my only computer, a little 1.6ghz netbook, encryption puts enough of an extra load on my machine that it makes it unbearably slow at responding a lot of the time when I have a lot of things open. But within a couple of weeks I&#039;ll have the money to get a nice desktop PC and I&#039;ll be installing ubuntu on it with encrypted everything. <br /><br />I am not so worried because I am newly in this country and while they are corrupt, being a foreigner here and not engaging with the local black market they are unlikely to have any significant intelligence on me, and anything that I left behind in the UK or australia (the ATO probably wants my ass fried, and probably has been talking to UK gov but I&#039;m gone now, so tough titty to them), is probably not interesting to the local fuzz, because it&#039;s only about $30,000 worth of creative GST claims, if that, over a 6 month period and I&#039;d guess it costs that much to have me deported without a reciprocal extradition treaty (and I would have been pretty safe from that had I decided to go to the netherlands where I hold citizenship).<br /><br />But I will feel a lot better once I have a PC and a proper label printer and such. It&#039;s not a big deal currently because I only send out little orders of 10 blotters and I handle all of the contents with latex gloves on and try not to write too much like my normal writing. I will like it much better when I can send it out with printed labels or in business window envelopes that have some fake corporate logo and words printed onto the envelope. I didn&#039;t spend a lot of time deciding where I would go after things went wrong in the UK but after I read about what it&#039;s like here in BG, low taxes, etc, and what I knew from a long time contact from IRC who lives a few suburbs away, that it was a pretty safe bet, and now that spring is here the weather is beautiful and I love the people here. Everything feels very right, it&#039;s just all been a bit of a struggle in the beginning. <br /><br />My dream is to raise enough money with selling stuff and some speculation on BTC that in a year or two I will finally be able to buy a little 10 acre farm somewhere up in the mountains around Sofia and finally be able to keep horses and have a few cats and a nice big organic synthesis lab and an inventors workshop, as I have many ideas about how to create some very interesting devices with very interesting capabilities (such as a self-charging capacitor/solenoid array) and maybe eventually I&#039;ll crack the gravity control question. And a big software project that I came up with after taking 1mg of bromo dragonfly... something that I&#039;m pretty much gonna get nowhere with unless I can source some good meds for my attention problem.

				I don&#039;t think any of it&#039;s going to happen though. I cheated on my vendor account and made 3 of the orders. I had been fielding orders for a drop shipper who crapped out just before I got to 30. now my account sits at 26 orders and i&#039;ve confessed to DPR my impropriety. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do now.
