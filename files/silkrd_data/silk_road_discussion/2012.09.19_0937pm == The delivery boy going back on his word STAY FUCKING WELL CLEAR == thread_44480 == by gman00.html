There are enough systems in place to protect you and if you choose to operate outside them then it&#039;s your problem. He may be a scammer, he may not, I can&#039;t say as I&#039;ve never done business with him. However, you&#039;re in the wrong section, you&#039;re post is totally incomprehensible and worst of all, for the 2nd time tonight, laziness is getting on my cyber tits.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been scammed in plenty of transactions and a lot of money, I&#039;ve worked with new vendors and experienced ones. Never once have I been a victim of a scam after what - 8 or 9 months now? Clearly, the effort you put into your own security and taking the proper measures makes a difference.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>n tryin be funny cunt i can write properly but on a fuckin forum so i write lyk textin on phone

I&#039;m writing to complain about the delivery boy. Shipping was very fast 7 days to UK. My order was fucked up completely. I ordered 7g brainstorm haze, but was given an 1/8 of super lemon og kush and an 1/8 of brainstorm haze. In the end, a 7g package arrived, and I was really excited, but was totally fucking let down. This was meant to be a full q of brainstorm haze, but was the biggest load of shit I have ever seen. I contacted the vendor, and we agreed that after I finalized he would partially refund 2.5 BTC, of the total 9.69 BTC I originally spent. He didn&#039;t do the partial refund after I finalized, and I messaged him a few times. He said this was because of my offensive language towards him.<br /><br />My head hurts too much to try the rest.

				Ok Thats what I thought...I don&#039;t think thats an admission of scamming gman00, you can see how heated gman00 caused the argument to get I think deliveryboy was just maybe venting he could have worded it differently maybe, he wasn&#039;t exactly saying haha I scammed you whilst you were attempting to scam me...I think I will give him a try with a small order gman00&#039;s package did arrive after all and it was an international order...I will post a review when I receive...
