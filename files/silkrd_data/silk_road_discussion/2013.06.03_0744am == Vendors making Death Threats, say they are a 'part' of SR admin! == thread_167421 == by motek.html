				We recieved this privnote a few weeks back, we notified SR high command AND the mods here ...<br /><br />THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING!<br /><br />What would YOU DO if you recieved this in a pm?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&quot;I&#039;d like you to know that if you do not immediately stop posting, I will have you killed. plain and simple. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 of the developers of silk road are actually partners of my partners, they have agreed to give me every single name and address you have used on SR. They have told me that you sometimes use multiple addresses. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a lot of industrial speed production partners in australia, and have decided instead of buying one high quality private detective/hitter, I will just pay for a gang of speed freaks to rape and kill you. They said that they will gangbang you even if it is old nasty pussy, they dont care. <br />&nbsp; You think that your address is deleted after the vendor places the order? <br />&nbsp;Well let me tell you, SR is backed up every single day and there is no encryption between you and the seller. <br />&nbsp;All the dev has to do is scan through the backups until they get to the day that you ordered, and your address will be in your current order. <br /><br />&nbsp; The have database backups of SR for the last year+ and have a very advanced script made to go back and look through it for various reasons. <br />&nbsp;You know why the mods told you I was banned when I wasn&#039;t? <br />&nbsp;Because they are working with me and just want you to shut up. <br />&nbsp;So: if you post a single thread about me or if I hear from the mods/devs that you are trying to report me again, I will send my partners partner 10k for all of the addresses, and I will send the speed freaks another 4k to make sure that this is more expensive for you than it is for me. <br />&nbsp; You can try your luck, maybe only your friends who get your packages will be hurt, theres a chance you can get away, is it worth it to you? It wont hurt me to spend the money, they promised to send me pictures of you before and after so I consider it an entertainment expense. But I would rather you just dissapeared and I can keep this money, your choice&quot;.<br /><br />This note has been destroyed, so if you want to keep its content, you must copy it before closing this page.<br /><br /><br />From Ron Paul .... he says we fucked his business! wtf!?<br />

				Sorry for asking, but what the hell have you done to make this guy so furious with you?<br /><br />Anyway for a bit of time, until the dust has settled, I would just purchase from vendors you have a very good relationship with and use drop addresses to be even more sure.<br /><br />As if SR is somewhat tied to this thing, I sincerely hope it&#039;s not so, or the thing is worrying.

				Wow powerful words from the faceless man. Seems like the internet in a nutshell nowadays.<br /><br />But really, scout already clarified the issue. The guy is not affiliated with the SR Admins, and nobody is going to waste 14K to come a murder you or your friends. As long as you&#039;ve taken the proper security precautions you&#039;re a-ok.<br /><br />It&#039;s obviously just some douche bag that had nothing better to do, and sounds like he was probably a little sped up when he wrote that (aka tweaker-speak, i&#039;m from the MW). I wouldn&#039;t worry if I were you. I&#039;d probably talk some more shit to see what kind of other crazy things I could get him to say. But hey, that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />Maybe you should let Karma get him? Karma is a dish best served with hummus<br /><br />

				These types of threats should not be tolerated in SR. As a community we should take an active role in shaming people like Ron Paul, even if the admins don&#039;t immediately ban him (which might take multiple reporting).<br /><br />In fact I&#039;m going to go to Ron Pauls page now and report him, if this is the necessary action to have my voice heard by the admins.<br /><br />Fuck you Ron Paul you absolute gowl.

When buyers don&#039;t provide a pgp key, privnote is the most quick was to exchange personal details. Buyers are fucking dickwads that do everything they can to take advantage of a vendor.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about his threats.<br /><br />The people running this site are making millions upon millions of dollars, I highly doubt they would collude with a second-rate vendor like Ron Paul to potentially ruin their reputation by doing something like this. The guy has 158 sales in a year and is only in the top 48%, he isn&#039;t shit. There are a lot of vendors who make more money in a month than he has made in his entire time here on the road and the Silk Road Admins could kiss his business goodbye without batting an eyelid.<br /><br />If he sends anymore privnotes, please screenshot the message as well as the open privnote, so he can&#039;t deny sending it to you.<br /><br />This kind of drama is why I only use drop addresses. My advice is to always build a relationship with a select group of trusted vendors that you regularly buy from to avoid these situations ever developing, and be careful when sending money to anyone new.

				Motek, you know how I know your a fucking liar?<br /><br />Any normal person, after reading this message and even having a gram of doubt about rather it was a lie or not, would turn off their computer, and stay off for 3 days. <br /><br />Instead you run to the forums, and post this. Either your a fucking liar, or enjoy speed freak gang rapes. If you even thought that ron paul was working with admins, you would be hiding in your closet right now.

If it&#039;s a pressing matter you are, of course, free to message the mods here and we will see to it that the issue receives an administrators attention, as we did with this issue. We don&#039;t always hear back when we send something up the chain due to how busy the administrators are but rest assured everything that we send up gets looked at or investigated if needs-be.<br /><br />Libertas

They have told me that you sometimes use multiple addresses. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a lot of industrial speed production partners in australia, and have decided instead of buying one high quality private detective/hitter, I will just pay for a gang of speed freaks to rape and kill you. They said that they will gangbang you even if it is old nasty pussy, they dont care. <br />&nbsp; You think that your address is deleted after the vendor places the order? <br />&nbsp;Well let me tell you, SR is backed up every single day and there is no encryption between you and the seller. <br />&nbsp;All the dev has to do is scan through the backups until they get to the day that you ordered, and your address will be in your current order. <br /><br />&nbsp; The have database backups of SR for the last year+ and have a very advanced script made to go back and look through it for various reasons. <br />&nbsp;You know why the mods told you I was banned when I wasn&#039;t? <br />&nbsp;Because they are working with me and just want you to shut up. <br />&nbsp;So: if you post a single thread about me or if I hear from the mods/devs that you are trying to report me again, I will send my partners partner 10k for all of the addresses, and I will send the speed freaks another 4k to make sure that this is more expensive for you than it is for me. <br />&nbsp; You can try your luck, maybe only your friends who get your packages will be hurt, theres a chance you can get away, is it worth it to you? It wont hurt me to spend the money, they promised to send me pictures of you before and after so I consider it an entertainment expense. But I would rather you just dissapeared and I can keep this money, your choice&quot;.<br /><br />This note has been destroyed, so if you want to keep its content, you must copy it before closing this page.<br /><br /><br />From Ron Paul .... he says we fucked his business! wtf!?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow..that&#039;s all I can really say, just ignore them their obviously scum bags with no life lol.

				I would have not fear of something like this myself, actually I would enjoy it - it&#039;s a lot of time I don&#039;t have the pleasure of turning life into literal hell to someone and I&#039;m beginning to have a little nostalgia about it ;) - but I can understand that for some people something like that can be problematic depending on the circumstances.<br /><br />I think that for Motek the thing that bothered him was the doubt that SR could indeed be involved on the thing and not the threat in itself, but I sincerely think that SR admins are not giving the threat an high priority just for the silliness of the thing, nothing more. I&#039;m sure that if they find proof that Ron Paul was indeed the one sending that Privnote they will ban him soon enough.

The very fact that SR is what it is, breeds the easy belief that anything said can be true. Fear is amazingly potent, and once theres even a sliver of it moving it into panic is only a matter of twisting the right button. We aren&#039;t in the DC/Marvel world - monologues don&#039;t happen in our reality. Threatening takes too long, and he already had your money... so, it&#039;s not economical for him to argue. As someone said before, this is the internet... there is no filter, and everyone thinks they&#039;re all that and a bag of potato chips. Since you&#039;ve been here posting about this, I get the feeling you already know this, and you weren&#039;t actually scared you wanted to just rub a name in the dirt... because people that are afraid don&#039;t sit around long enough to watch a thread.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to take the opposite side in this, but the devils advocate side of me wants to reflect on the causal incident. If you purchase something, and turn around and say &quot;this is bunk&quot; there will undoubtedly be retaliation. Depending on the maturity of the way that you point out the bad product, it is entirely possible to have the volume turned up on both sides. Throwing the ape-shit psycho I&#039;ll gouge out your heart with a spoon might work for getting a refund for a subtly brick-filled ps3 at best buy, but here that probably won&#039;t fly. Was his response (if IS isn&#039;t right in the idea that you wrote it) inappropriate? Highly, and that comes with reprecussions on its own.<br /><br />But smoke a bowl next time instead of doing a line before bitching the guy out, you might find the result going far more in your favor :)

				hi everyone and thans for the cool inputs ;)<br /><br />Firstly, we dont REALLY give a fuck about this douchebag, and we too highly doubt he CAN do shit, let alone WILL do anything.

(e.g. my gf) Suffice to say ANYONE who fucks with her gets to regret it! :o<br /><br />Secondly, we never bought anything from this guy, another member who did get burned by him sent us a copy.&nbsp; RP &#039;thought&#039; we were bluffing! LMAO when I sent him a copy and then posted it here on the forum!<br /><br />Look at the VERY FIRST LINE!&nbsp; &nbsp;would I be posting here if I didn&#039;t have a &#039;death wish&#039; lol!?<br />The real &#039;problem&#039; is this idiot (and all his alter egos) are a loose cannon, just like FiniteSuss and as such SHOULD be avoided, so we decided to &#039;share the love&#039; with you all! he he!<br /><br /><br />We haven&#039;t been here all that long BUT we now clearly see the problem of not being&nbsp; &#039;honest&#039; here, either with reviews or anything else!<br />When we first came we saw the shit this dude was peddling and HAD TO say something!&nbsp; <br />People get BADLY HURT fucking around with this stuff PLUS what he is selling HAS MANY errors or is very outdated!<br /><br />Whatever happened to the Poopermachine who said he was &quot;almost done&quot; and &quot;will be finished by the end of the month? (that was over a month ago?)<br /><br />I&#039;ll tell you, he NEVER SUCCEEDED becoz IF he really was TRYING to follow RP/DDW&#039;s instructions he was destined to fail!&nbsp; &quot;Make kilos of sick Shards?!&quot;&nbsp; lol! Yeah..Right!<br /><br />lol, here&#039;s some &quot;sick shards!&quot; ........... the ultimate shards!!!&nbsp; **clearnet warning**&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=423_1367215584&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And the &#039;other&#039; thing is his &#039;allegations&#039; of being &#039;connected&#039; to SR high command! Again, yeah right!&nbsp; BUT if we were SR admin we would be pretty pissed off with such slander (if that&#039;s what ir is) and would ban him a) coz he&#039;s obviously scamming people b) becoz we could shut this fools dangerous lies and hopefully save a few of the more naive peeps who actually believe this dude!<br /><br />Man! the 26+ page thread where I disputed his chemistry had a LOT of his &#039;supporters&#039; giving me shit and neg karma!&nbsp; IMO what was said there was &#039;self explanatory&#039; however there&#039;s a lot of &#039;ambitious&#039; people here who are dumb enough to put their fb page in their sig! Just trying to save a few of these fools (AND their neighbors!) from themselves!<br /><br />Ah sooo many things to say, such poor typing skills!<br /><br />Thanks everyone for the input. keep it coming.<br /><br />m m m motek ;)<br /><br />p.s gamma goblin pm me and we&#039;ll see what we can do, we like to help<br />

				EXACTLY hoobydoobydoo EXACTLY!! + 100 bro ;)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &quot;there is NO bad feedback on any of the guides on offer spanning the last 4 months, meaning that nobody - including the person you say sent you the guide - had reason to complain about it.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Actually Libertas,&nbsp; this member sent me a copy as he had been reading the RP/DDW thread after they HAD bought it AND discovered it was &quot;unfeasable&quot; and felt ripped off and was very happy to see us do what we did, and hence the support <br /><br />AND,&nbsp; they asked me to keep them &quot;out of it&quot; as they WERE FEARFUL OF RETALIATION of sorts!!&nbsp; Exactly &quot;what type&quot; of retaliation IDK, suffoce to say they HAD BEEN INTIMIDATED by &#039;someone&#039; and were very happy to see me take this wankers chemistry to task! <br /><br />In fact it was this topic that inspried Ruthenium to start their &#039;Chemistry&quot; page<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d REALLY like to know how this dude HAS maintained his rating while selling unviable, incomprehensible chemistry &#039;guides&#039;!! <br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s pretty clear after 26-7 pages of&nbsp; &quot;arguments&quot; with RP/DDW in which NOBODY came forth and supported his &quot;guides&quot; ... even Poopermachine who said he WAS in the process of doing the mdma synth AND with ALL of RP&#039;s &quot;consulting&quot; FAILED MISERABLY!!!<br /><br /><br />IMO most, if not all of these people didn&#039;t want to been seen as the naive people they are/were, just like people wont admit to FE&#039;ing as they&#039;ll cop the wrath of other members for doing so!<br />You may have noticed the reviews on his page are exremely simplistic, t<br /><br />And there&#039;s NOT ONE that says &quot;yeah, this worked as expected!&quot;&nbsp; NOT ONE!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;hmmmmmm motek ;)

Based on this, how are we to even believe what your original posts claim, about what he said?

				Motek,<br /><br />I woke up and this AM, i HAD A PM from someone, a Member, subject title was SR ADMIN.. The username was something like Sr admin enforcement or some shit..&nbsp; Claimed he was once a vendor but is now part of DPR&#039;s team of admins, and He knows i reported him for scamming months bak, and someother bullshit and , he has all 4 of my address, which i knew was a lie cause iv never used 4 address. Then goes on to say he is reporting my name to crime stoppers and DEA,<br /><br />but if i dont want any issues transfer 5 grand over to him..LOL, Then he really fucked up and said, he knows where i stay in the UK an the detectives are watching me.. Well im not from nor even been from the UK, or ever order&#039;d from there..<br /><br />aND Only vendor i had it out with EVER! was that lame, Deathb4dishonor, who was a lier,scammer and all the above. I remember when the moron first started with H, he sent me some to try to tell him how it was, he claimed him and hes buddys were WRECKED off 10mg..LOL, then he went on to tell me it was #3, and had it listed that way for a week or so,<br /><br />then i get it, and tell him, he&#039;s wrong and doesnt know his H, it was #4 and it took almost 150mg to feel muchof anything.. So he tells me he is getting some new stuff,&nbsp; and to thank me for letting him know it was #4, and not sellin the H as the wrong name, he was gonna send me more of better stuff, <br /><br />I told him rite off, if your claiming 15mg gets u wrecked from this new stuff, im sure its just as bad as the other, well, he must not of had a Microscale cause he tells me hes sending .2 dude sent me Half a G, which was fine with me, and that time actually was some what better..<br /><br />But as to the original topic, I have no clue what the motivations are behind this BS, I knw of 3 others that got wild msgs, with threats but just havent spoke of it on here,

My question was purely on the legitimacy of the sought out argument in this case. I am going to quote from the first post you made, and then I am going to quote from the post that I have concerned myself with:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: motek</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We recieved this privnote a few weeks back, we notified SR high command AND the mods here ...<br /><br />THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You direct us to the information in a private note, that was sent to you in regards to what was implied as a disagreement over a product. For most of the thread, we presumed this meant you purchased it, and you found the information contained within to be bogus. In addition, you further perpetrated the recent mod-bashing by enforcing an opinion that the mods did not care, either through neglect or through the inappropriate assumption that they can do anymore than contact the core admins of SR, and this was later adressed by libertas including an apology for not being 100% diligent in the informing of no progress being made. Now, lets go to the post that I care most about.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: motek</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Firstly, we dont REALLY give a fuck about this douchebag, and we too highly doubt he CAN do shit, let alone WILL do anything. PLUS he or ANYONE foolish enough to try this with me WILL get a nasty surprise.&nbsp; This I have told him.<br /><br />However, there are some who dont have the same killer streak as I, and it&#039;s these folks that concern me. (e.g. my gf) Suffice to say ANYONE who fucks with her gets to regret it! <br /><br />Secondly, we never bought anything from this guy, another member who did get burned by him sent us a copy.&nbsp; RP &#039;thought&#039; we were bluffing! LMAO when I sent him a copy and then posted it here on the forum!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is only selecting the bulk top portion of the post. You did three things here. For one, you basically blatantly stated that your furious attempt at drawing out RP on a private note that was sent in anger were unfounded - that you didn&#039;t care, and you intentionally came here to specifically rub RP&#039;s face in the dirt over a private note scuffle.<br /><br />Then, you make sure to inform us that &quot;Anyone foolish enough to try this with me will get a nasty surprise. This I have told him.&quot; This is the same threat that you claim RP made towards you. It may not be specific, but it is hardly innocent. If you had left it here, it could have been easily implied that you were just standing up for something, but then you went on to claim that others don&#039;t have the same &quot;killer streak&quot; as you, and that you will avenge anyone who fucks with your girlfriend. This is nice bravado, but all you are doing is the same mindless insult that you claimed he had in the first post - you are threatening. This is quite the turn from your prior stance in the thread.<br /><br />Now, the final point, which is the one that draws the most concern to me, is the final one you made. You never bought anything from RP, it was given to you by another member. Since we are to understand that this is RP&#039;s chemistry product, we already know that this is a tangible, non-parishable product. You further claim that you then personally went to RP, and threatened in regards to what you considered a bunk product. Then, you enacted this threat, which we now know was to send him a copy of the product that you did not purchase, did not pay for, and had no right owning outside of the fact that another member who DID pay for it gave it TO you for free. Then, you not only did not stop there, but you put this product, that RP is selling, up for grabs out of spite.<br /><br /><br /><br />Since all of the &quot;evidence&quot; regarding RP&#039;s threatening towards you is in a non-evidentiary privnote that is gone with the wind, all we are left with now is to focus on what is discussed in this post. Do you really not understand why someone would be livid over this? This is not the way you deal with a product you disagree with. You&#039;ve sabotaged his business, and you&#039;ve already made it clear that you are also in the &quot;market&quot; as a learning source for chemistry.<br /><br />Is it really that difficult to understand how I could come to a conclusion that you did this to boost your own sales?<br /><br />That is my question in a nutshell. There are those that came to your defense in this thread, and tried to help, Libertas included. After this thread though, I have to question the validity of any of the statements you made, up to and including the very private note that you claim as evidence of real life information retention &amp; planned assault. With the above information, this now looks more like libel than anything else.

At the end of the day Motek is on it for no damn reason. This is unjust. You cannot justify it because you don&#039;t think many vendors use it. That&#039;s like the New York Times publishing something incorrect about you, some allegation that is incorrect. And then when you go to the ombudsman to have it removed they say &quot;Ah sure not everyone in the world read the New York Time, so don&#039;t worry about it&quot;.<br /><br />Motek is reaching out to admins for help and the only help he&#039;s getting is from regular members.

I wasn&#039;t justifying it because many vendors don&#039;t use it, I justified it by the fact that vendors are entitled to freedom of speech just like the rest of us. Many buyers keep lists of vendors that they will not buy from, and post threads in the Rumor Mill saying &quot;don&#039;t buy from Vendor X for such and such a reason&quot; - should we infringe on their right to say that because it is &#039;unjust&#039;?<br /><br />This is a free and open community - the New York Times is a private, closed-ended business. The two cannot be compared as equals.<br /><br />If motek has an issue he has been told to bring it up with administrators, and presumably he has done so. He messaged me before regarding this and I sent it up the chain but heard nothing back. He knows that there is nothing we can do from the forums as we do not have access to the administrative sections of the main site. Therefore, it is entirely up to the administrators to look into, and for them to communicate their findings to motek. Before you tell me to &quot;take this seriously&quot;, please research the history of the situation.<br /><br />Libertas

I came to your defense. I was here, defending you. I supported you. I took no ill will against you, and I did take it against RP. Why would I have started on your side in this thread, if I was a RP supporter? I think you need to take some of your own advice bud. I have read all three threads, I have been watching them all for the entire time I&#039;ve been here today. Choosing to post in one, does not mean I&#039;ve ignored the other two.<br /><br />Listen to me. And listen well. It is difficult for supporters to continue supporting the irrational. If you continue down the road of irrational fighting, you will lose even the supporters that have been around you this entire time. You are taking everything personal. Stop. Cool off. Go back, and read your posts in each thread. Read over them, and compare them to everyone elses. You are not only becoming more erradic, but the bulk of your posts are drifting from primarily scientific debate to personal defense. This is not the sign of someone that will garner support for their cause. You, and no one else, are causing the posts that are no longer in your favor. You&#039;re doing it to yourself. Why are you attacking me, when I merely questioned you and asked for you to explain why these discrepancies exist? I&#039;ve not argued the basis for your disagreement. I do not argue the validity of your claims. I&#039;m not going to. I am merely questioning your intent. I quoted the same text for you twice. You said it YOURSELF. I did not fabricate any of the information I used to QUESTION the purpose of this thread. I used your own words. If you cannot defend it against someone who supported you, how on earth can you expect to garner support from those that don&#039;t?<br /><br />I merely stated that you took a route to say that you had a &quot;killer instinct&quot; and threw around meaningless weight towards the fact. Defense of a partner doesn&#039;t require mindless bravado or ineffective showmanship, no more than the same contained in RP&#039;s private note. I don&#039;t know RP, I don&#039;t care. I came to this thread and early on defended you, and in reading a post you stated in series, the defense that I stated was put in question by myself and no one else. I am questioning WHY I came to your defense, based upon the information that I am now provided BY you. I could throw around silly verbs about my cock or how many guns I have in a shed, but why? Is this really necessary? It doesn&#039;t matter to me one bit, you&#039;re damned right you should defend your partner - it&#039;s implied. There is no NEED to state that you will, as it is ASSUMED that any individual would come to the rescue of their significant other. To not do so, implies a heartless individual. It is, for the most part, just padded information to try and look tough. Who gives a shit.<br /><br />Look at my post. Am I resulting to shouting? Am I picking apart every little piece that is negative about you, and using this as my only argument? No. I admire that you would protect your partner. The majority of my posts in this thread are FOR your defense. But with your recent posts in all three of the threads now, you are doing nothing but harm to your argument. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you want to take this another route, then fine, but remember that even in scientific discussion you will face those who will question your theories left and right. This is science. It would not be science if it were not for cricism. If you want to argue the validity of a paper dealing with the mechanics of organic compound synthesis, resulting to personal details is not science. None of that belongs in such a discussion.

Simple :o.<br /><br />As far as you being &quot;on RP&#039;s side&quot;&nbsp; did you read where I mentioned I had a few vendors OFFER me FREE drugs?<br /><br />&nbsp;Vendors who claimed I had pm&#039;d them in the past (which I had not) vendors who have been on TSR for almost a year! <br /><br />Vendors who are either, RP himself, OR,&nbsp; have been offered the &quot;bounty&quot; for providing details.&nbsp; No doubt in an attempt to get my addy!<br /><br /><br />When you take ALL these things into consideration, you sound a LOT like many of&nbsp; the peeps who for reasons unknown, support him and his &quot;guides&quot; <br />EVEN THOUGH it&#039;s very clear they are effectively useless, as the 27 page thread asking for people who had had success with his &quot;guides&quot; ... NO ONE answered in the affirmative! NO ONE!<br /><br />as well as the FACT I HAVE&nbsp; offered SR admin ALL the relevant pm&#039;s BUT they haven&#039;t (yet?) asked for them!&nbsp; <br /><br />Why not?<br /><br /><br />Dude, you need to check your facts!&nbsp; Like I suggested, why dont you go and read the thread that starteed this in the first place,, my reasoning for posting is repeated several times throughout it<br /><br />WHY would a random member send me the synths IF they thought they were valid? <br /><br />&nbsp;Becoz they aren&#039;t viable for the people RP/DDW says WILL be able to DO this stuff &quot;with NO special equipment&quot; etc. which IS bullshit!<br /><br />I have also seen his LSD synth ... and it too is FAR beyond anyone without a good grounding in Ochem.&nbsp; <br /><br />He doesn&#039;t even MENTION which compound is supposed to be used as a feedstock!&nbsp; (it&#039;s LSA But that word is never said ANYWHERE throughout his &quot;guide&quot; !! :o)<br /><br />HOW the fuck are the people who buy them &quot;supposed to know&quot; that?&nbsp; Esp IF they have no Ochem experience?&nbsp; (dont try and answer this Q OBA, you cant, it&#039;s rhetorical, go read the thread)<br /><br />I couldnt do it, most certainly not following these instructions, and I honestly doubt anyone without a VERY decent home lab could pull this off!<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;as I&#039;ve said several times,&nbsp; <br />&quot;If/when SR admin ask, I WILL provide them with MORE EVIDENCE&quot;&nbsp; BUT they haven&#039;t requested anything at all, even after I HAD offered!<br /><br />Anyhow <br />I&#039;ve better things to talk about, I&#039;m not here to debate, I came here to &quot;state&quot; what happened.&nbsp; IF you dont &#039;believe&#039; me, fine, I really dont care, this thread has been productive anyway, without your input, <br /><br />Hmmmm motek

I cannot simply &quot;draw the line between freedom of speech and threats/blackmail&quot; as it is a complex issue. Threats are defined as anything that may give a member reasonable cause to fear for their safety or personal information. If it can be proven that a vendor has threatened a buyer then their vending privileges will be stripped. This does not yet seem to be the case and the claims of it occurring are something that it is up to SR Support to investigate.<br /><br />Blackmail is defined here as any action taken by one party in order to induce a desired effect contrary to the wishes of the other party. If such blackmail occurred via Silk Road PM then it will be found should an investigation take place. Stating on a vendor profile that a buyer&#039;s username may be added to the vendor blacklist unless a 5/5 is given etc. can not be considered &#039;blackmail&#039; as - by placing an order with that vendor - the buyer is agreeing to the terms and conditions outlined on the vendor&#039;s page.<br /><br />Libertas

				Ive already offered DW moteks address and I have the pms to prove that of motek talking about arrangements for a certain item to be shipped to AUS.<br />DW basically told me to leave her alone in a way that made me think he genuinely feels sorry for her.<br />Anyway youd think the mods wouldnt let her go all slanderous over many many threads on a good vendor, but who really cares I guess, its good entertainment.

				So as I understand it this has been brought to the attention of the admins and they will be investigating the allegations being made, if proof of rule breaking is discovered then action will be taken against the vendor concerned.<br /><br />motek please just deal directly with the admin team now you have raised this in an open forum, anyone else who has experienced issues will I am sure now come forward however everything else in this thread is pointless drama as all it does is invite anyone with an uninformed opinion to have their say.

				Yes, SSS me too!&nbsp; &nbsp;I just wonder why SR admin havent asked me for more information?&nbsp; <br /><br />They say the can see all my pm&#039;s which are quite damning in themselves! Go figure?&nbsp; <br /><br />I know that would have gone about this scenarios&nbsp; rather differently than they had!<br /><br />You know, if you do a search here on the main page for &quot;threats&quot;&nbsp; there ar 17 pages of&nbsp; posts containing the word, most of which are related to vendors making them to buyers!<br /><br /><br />I&nbsp; cant see where&nbsp; threats from ANYONE, are &quot;ok&quot; to make!&nbsp; &nbsp;IMO ANY vendor or buyer alike should NOT be making ANY threats here, regardless of the &quot;reason&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not the place for such things and should be moderated accordingly, we are ALL effectively &quot;on the wrong side of the law&quot; and do not need a so called &#039;peers&#039; becoming their &#039;enemies!&#039;&nbsp; <br /><br />And ANYONE&nbsp; that does&nbsp; so,&nbsp; vendor OR buyer,&nbsp; SHOULD BE BANNED immediately! <br /><br /><br />Anyway, we&#039;ve made our point and if you want to delete this thread SS, feel free as it&#039;s served it&#039;s purpose<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Part of motek is pretty sick at the moment, and may not see out the end of the year, <br /><br />kind regards all who commented and/or offered their support, it was appreciated<br /><br />m m m motek ;)

				Seeing this thread is what made me decide to bring me threat i was sent to the attention, I just brushed it off at first, responded with a &quot;FU AN FUK OFF&quot; to the suppose -SR ADMIN ENFORCER- LOL.. <br /><br />But i figured the community needed to knw, we have new kids, and new members all the time that join up, dont bother to read vendor profiles, or the forums, and could easly fall victim to BS from a Vendor, or just some loser who was dumb enuff to make an account and try to scare someone to send them money..<br /><br />Good Job IMO Motek, ALLways been a Supporter of yours! <br /><br />btw this is off subject, But admins, an we (The community) have a vote to kick Fakeboss&#039;s ass of these threads? LOL, or keep him FULL TIME AN make it where he is stuck in the &quot;Newbie section&#039;? lol.. The guy is annoying as hell!! not to mention seems to choose random members to follow and stalk, also vendors..lol
