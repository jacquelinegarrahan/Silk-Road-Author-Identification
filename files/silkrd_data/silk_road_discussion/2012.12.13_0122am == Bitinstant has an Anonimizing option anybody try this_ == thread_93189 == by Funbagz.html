				Bitinstant has changed their page again and now they&#039;re asking for a Name and Birth date. but somewhere on the page i found an option that costs 1.5%. It purchases coin at market value from Mt.Gox and sends them to whatever address. Has anybody tried this?

				What&#039;s the option? - What do you &quot;click on&quot;??<br /><br />I see no new alternative, and going through MT. Gox, just adds more middlemen and costs more. <br /><br />Unless I&#039;m missing something. <br /><br />Who care&#039;s about your name DOB, and such anyway? <br /><br />Buying, selling, and owning Bitcoins, is legal. <br /><br />Though I do use my Cat&#039;s name, DOB, email, and phone#, just in case --- ;-)

				I only use Mtgox because I&#039;m a lazy fucker and don&#039;t like to take handfulls of cash to the bank or CVS or whatever to buy coins.&nbsp; I&#039;m still not quite sure what the benefit to the above would be?&nbsp; You&#039;re still probably going to run your coins through a cleaner before sending them to SR anyway, or at least I hope you&#039;re going to!

				I dont remember how i got to it. It was a link through another site actually.... but it WAS bitinstant. Sombody probably programed something themselves using the Bitinstant API. i&#039;ll keep looking<br />

				Ok I bumped this thread because what i was talking about was actually an option in blockchain.info. Under Deposit &amp; Withdraw you click Cash Deposit and it uses bitinstant but also offers Make Anonymous.<br /><br /><br />Amount:<br />$<br /><br />Enter the amount to purchase in USD. 1 BTC = $ 13.30 (3.99% Fee)<br />Make Anonymous?<br /><br />The bitcoins will be sent through our mixer for improved privacy (1.5% Fee).<br />

				I&#039;m testing it from my phone. blockchain.info has a decent mobile site. My plan is to transfer the coins to a different wallet before SR anyway, but I think the idea is that your purchased coins go into a pot, from which you&#039;ll receive random coins.

				Cash deposit method at blockchain.info is really quick! Plus for 1.5% of my bitcoin I get the added feelings of comfort of that little checkbox that says &quot;Make Anonymous.&quot; There is even another option at blockchain that says&quot;<br />Send Anonymously<br />Use Send Anonymously to guarantee the transaction cannot be traced between sender and receiver.&quot; and costs 1.5%<br /><br /><br />I tried looking at the blockchain history, but I wouldn&#039;t know how to trace it to begin with.
