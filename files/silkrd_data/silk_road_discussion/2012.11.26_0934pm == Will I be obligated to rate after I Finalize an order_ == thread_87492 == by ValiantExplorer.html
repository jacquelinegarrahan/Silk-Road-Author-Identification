				A seller requires finalization. But even though I&#039;m willing to permanently depart with my BC, I would like to retain the right to give a rating to that seller only after the product has arrived (and perhaps has been tested). I&#039;m not sure if that is possible and I would not like to risk not giving feedback to the seller and this being considered as 1/5 or 0/5. So can please assure me that I can do this? Or at least tell me I can&#039;t?<br /><br />Thank you.

				If you go into account, then on the right there should be an option to &#039;View Feedback&#039;.<br /><br />From in there you can change your rating and comment when your order arrives. :)<br /><br />makku

				So if I give a 5/5 feedback, I can modify that later? That seems a bit risky. It would mean that if a customer gets angry on a seller, he/she may revert all ratings to 1/5. I guess there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing :).

				Well obviously I hope I never get to the point I&#039;d be *THAT* angry at any seller! That would just mean something went terribly wrong.<br /><br />Thank you for the answers people!

				Oh, interesting, so basically everybody gets a clean slate after 3 months. That... can be good :). Allows a seller to fix up his/her reputation.

				I&#039;ve seen some people leave 3/5 for FE&#039;s with a message that says will update to 5/5 upon arrival.<br /><br />Choice is yours, but I would just as soon choose not to deal with FE requirements. <br /><br /><br />

				I agree that FE is not recommended, but sometimes it can&#039;t be avoided. Especially since I&#039;m a rather new buyer and I don&#039;t have that many transactions. I don&#039;t want the sellers to think I&#039;m a fraud, because I&#039;m not. On the other hand, that doesn&#039;t mean I should throw myself at the mercy of the sellers. It boils down to judgement and after a few messages, I can kinda&#039; smell if a seller is a good guy. Of course, I could be wrong :).

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a clean slate every 3 months, I knew the feedback was only kept for that long but I thought the overall score reflected the duration of the seller&#039;s account. I could be wrong though, I sure someone will let me know if I am ;)<br /><br />And you might be tired of hearing it, but please don&#039;t FE. Escrow is the only protection you have. There are plenty of sellers who will work with new buyers, they might not have exactly what you are looking for, but it is better than getting ripped off. Look or ask around. There are plenty of cases of reputable vendors turning into scammers. It sucks but trust me, you don&#039;t want to learn the hard way.
