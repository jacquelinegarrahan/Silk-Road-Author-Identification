				I&#039;ve got another post floating around with a different problem but here is a whole new issue. This time, for the first time, with silk road. <br /><br />First, let me say that I am a new (and terribly confused bitcoin/silk road) customer. With that being said, I FINALLY got 37 coins over to my silk road account today. Logged back in a couple of hours later and they&#039;re gone. Here is the transaction summary: **I have put stars in place of my deposit numbers because I&#039;m still unsure what numbers are safe to give out**<br /><br /><br />admin&nbsp; &nbsp;admin&nbsp; &nbsp;฿-74.00&nbsp; &nbsp;฿0.00&nbsp; &nbsp;October 26, 2011, 9:39 pm UTC<br />admin&nbsp; &nbsp;admin&nbsp; &nbsp;฿37.00&nbsp; &nbsp;฿74.00&nbsp; &nbsp;October 26, 2011, 8:21 pm UTC<br />deposit&nbsp; &nbsp;(********)฿37.00&nbsp; &nbsp;฿37.00&nbsp; &nbsp;October 26, 2011, 3:20 pm UTC<br /><br />Please explain? I am more confused than ever.

				Dude, you&#039;re a good guy, but you really need to just slow down, and do some research first, rather than just throwing shit out there, and getting in trouble, then coming here posting threads.&nbsp; Do what me and countless others have had to do: go to the Security forum, and read through it: every problem you&#039;ve had, has been had by others.&nbsp; Every one of us has to bone up on btc and on phishing and on pgp and how to use it...this isn&#039;t a site to make costly errors on...<br /><br />We really don&#039;t want our newbies getting in trouble...we help any way we can, but you have to do your bit, and read up on the Security Forum of how to operate here.&nbsp; If not, you&#039;re just sitting prey for some scammer, and believe me, they are reading this too...<br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#039;t move any more btc until you get your shit straightened out.&nbsp; It appears you&#039;ve been moving them directly from xchange to here, anyway, not a good idea.&nbsp; It just takes a couple days of study, and asking questions when you don&#039;t understand something....if you had read up a bit, you would have known to always have the SR address, and to *never* come here from a link.&nbsp; I know the address here and of main site, so this doesn&#039;t happen...<br /><br />Best wishes, seems like you&#039;re having a really hard time of it, and it doesn&#039;t have to be that way...but this is pioneer days bro, we don&#039;t have sheriff out here ;)

				I dont think that he were phished. Decription says &quot;admin&quot;, I had the same case when admin made some corrections with me due some system glitch. All phishers are withdraws.<br />Contact SR admin ASAP.

I am the original dude who posted this. (BTW, This dude looks like a lady...hehe) Anyway, I just got resolve this morning and hadn&#039;t been back yet to update. I just wanted you to know that SR finally contacted me back and apologized saying that apparently my transaction got flagged for some odd reason and they credited them back. The way they explained it sounded like it wasn&#039;t an uncommon thing to happen. <br /><br />I hope this puts your mind at ease. I remember the rapid heartbeat and fear thinking all was lost. Turns out it was a glitch.<br /><br />Good luck and I&#039;m sure you have already but just in case, send a message to SR because that is the only way they have of knowing.

				Yea SR is very good about crediting money when there is a problem. I had him credit 2 things on my account and they took right care of it. One of them even before I finished posting about it on the forum. They definitely kick the service up a notch when there is money involved.

				It&#039;s true that SR is quick and honest about straightening out any problems.&nbsp; I also feel that it was my responsiblity, when I first came on here, to learn how to protect myself.&nbsp; This mean, even then, going thru older security threads, that explained how to protect passwords better.&nbsp; Had to make sure I was using different pswds for both forums. Had to learn how btc operated, so I could check my blocks, check if my transfer had gone thru on blockexplorer.com.&nbsp; Had to sign up on bitcoin talk, and learn what to do if my btc got blocked.&nbsp; Certainly had to learn a lot about Tor, and then Tails and LiberteLinux.&nbsp; A ton of studying to learn pgp...<br /><br />Takes a lot of perseverance, but others have done it, so I could too.&nbsp; Then, when I still had probems once, with money not showing up, I felt good that I could contact SR, and, as has been stated, he straightened up problems at once.&nbsp; I agree that ripoffs are not some rite of passage.&nbsp; I do think that expecting newbies to do a little homework before asking questions, is.<br /><br />Best wishes to all.
