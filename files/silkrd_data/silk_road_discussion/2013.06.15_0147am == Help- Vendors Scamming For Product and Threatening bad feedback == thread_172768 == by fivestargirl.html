				I&#039;m a fairly new vendor, doing a great job by my buyers but I&#039;ve had 4 buyers now this week threaten to leave bad feedback if I don&#039;t do what they say (all had good stats-not overwhelming but solid):<br /><br />1. Buyer placed order, it shipped express to arrive tomorrow (2 day express as he lives in a rural town) - he insists its always a 1 day express and I did something wrong. I told him to go to the usps.com website and choose any big city east coast zip to his zip and price it out express- its always 2 days. I even went to my local po to confirm this. He is asking for me to refund his entire order - which he will pay back tomorrow with interest (BS) if it arrives. I offered to refund his shipping charges of $20 (I have told him it would arrive saturday since he placed the order so its not late) if he finalized now. I gave him the DCN it says on the website its shipped and guaranteed delivery tomorrow by 3pm. He refuses to finalize and wants his money and me to do a custom order which he will pay when he receives it-or will leave bad feedback. The usps site has not updated its transit on this package and I&#039;m beginning to feel that his has checked in constantly on TOR perhaps jeopardizing his package. Either way, this is extortion. What recourse do we vendors have against something like this? <br /><br />2. Buyer admits to using fake name - the buyer can&#039;t remember which fake name they used. Starts out telling me that their fake name has caused problems with shipping and they aren&#039;t getting packages because of it. The package I sent was actually &quot;refused&quot; and sent back. Buyer wants brand new product or will leave bad feedback. My vendor page clearly says not to use fake names and if you do - purchase at your own risk, its your liability if you screw it up.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had any of these situations arise before so I don&#039;t know what recourse I have as a seller against this? I looked through the seller&#039;s guide and couldn&#039;t find anything. I can&#039;t run a business with people trying to extort me. Should I just tell them if they have a problem them to click resolve and let SR handle this? I&#039;ve never had to rsolve anything. Can anyone please advise what methods SR has to protect us in these types of situations??<br /><br />Thanks so much

If he even goes in to Resolution.<br /><br />Having packs returned cause of faults, is not the vendors fault.<br />Especially when its stated in you Faqs about not using the fake names.<br /><br />You have 100% rating and is solid vendor. You win. Relax.&nbsp; 8)<br />

				Nothing you can do except... <br /><br />Given in, get a 5/5. <br />Resist, get a 1/5. <br /><br />Most new sellers go through this bullshit. <br /><br />What would be cool is if SR reso backed up a vendor who is clearly in the right and set some kind of block so that scam buyer can&#039;t leave feedback after the situation is decided by SR reso. <br /><br />That would be straight up justice.

				It&#039;s been said before, but it&#039;d be great if vendors could rate buyers a la ebay, Sorry you&#039;ve got some buyer troubles, you&#039;ll soon establish a trusted base if you&#039;re providing a good service, AB.

				I personally wouldn&#039;t give in to extortion. Make them take it to resolution and see who they back. From your posts, I don&#039;t think you have anything to worry about on that score. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen vendors address poor feedback on their vendor page so other buyers would get both sides of the story, that is an option as well. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let scammers win.
