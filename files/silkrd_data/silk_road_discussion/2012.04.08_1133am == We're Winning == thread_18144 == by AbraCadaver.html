				LE almost certainly know that I am receiving banned substances through the post. Why? Because a few months ago a 10 gram order of mine got stopped coming from outside my home country. This was from a reputable vendor with whom I have completed satisfactory orders subsequently. <br /><br />BUT, instead of allowing this to scare me, I changed tactics. I started ordering much smaller amounts from within my home country instead. Very regularly. Every single one has come through. If they wanted to arrest me 10 times or more, they could have done. Ask yourselves this: why haven&#039;t they done it yet? Building a case? Each individual piece of evidence they have against me is just as weak as the others, the fact that there are several of them still does not constitute incontravertable evidence.<br /><br />We have them over barrel. They can&#039;t bust Silk Road customer addresses because it would create alot of publicity and very few actual prosecutions, and publicity is clearly the very thing that the governments/LE do not want. They can&#039;t afford to keep confiscating thousands of packages with tiny amounts of drugs in them, as even confiscations with no arrests cost time and money.<br /><br />I put it to you all again: we are winning.

				The fact of the matter is that governments just don&#039;t want to see that legalization is key! Of course all of us on here will be somewhat bias but this is my two cents anyway.<br /><br />If drugs were to be legalized there would be many problems but there would also be many benefits like employment - this might sound funny or stupid but this is a serious point! Of course there would be the retailers (drug dealers) but this would then also create a demand for these products on a higher level and to maintain the supply for the demand, labs would be opened and farms specifically for growing drugs would also become a valuable industry. Companies that would specialize in recreational drugs such as those in the pharmaceutical industry like Pfizer etc. would also be formed.<br /><br />This could very possibly lead to the end of poverty because the demand for drugs is so high as it is and if made legal the demand would be so much higher!<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe that people would turn to crime to support their habits because as we all should know if it were to become legal the prices would drop dramatically as these drugs start being mass produced.<br /><br />At the end of the day I feel that it is the individuals choice to put whatever substances they wish to into their own bodies provided they do not cause problems to anyone else - same as other legal drugs, i.e. alcohol - public intoxication and DUI. There would obviously also have to be laws, laws like the ones that control alcohol.<br /><br />A lot of people die every year from alcohol and cigarettes so the fear of a large number of people ODing is irrelevant because people die from other legal substances too! I for one have lost my brother to a drunk and driving car accident!<br /><br />Karma is always appreciated! ;)<br /><br />Lloyd

				The only benefit of full legalization that Silk Road hasn&#039;t already achieved is price reduction<br /><br />That I can think of, and only if you really know how to shop around, the benefits of Silk Road are:<br /><br />- Consistent high quality (and no contaminants)<br />- Huge choice of varying product types and strengths (how hard is it to find someone IRL to get LSD or mescaline? Or to go out of your way to choose CBD rich non-skunk cannabis varieties, directly from South African farmers!)<br />- Honest vendors<br />- No waiting around on bleak street corners looking suspicious<br />- No getting messed around having been promised something for hours, only to get no call back<br />- No product droughts<br /><br /><br />I guess the post could be quicker, and even despite the prices, it&#039;s not a bad compromise overall. I&#039;m pretty happy about it&nbsp; :D <br /><br /><br />

				This place has a lot of benefits, but it is a drop in the ocean for the drug market.&nbsp; The traditional distribution model is still the dominant one, and I doubt this model will replace it because of it&#039;s inherent drawbacks, and there are many.<br /><br />The Tor network itself is not untouchable, and I think that will be the first thing they go after, once they pass the &quot;we have a right to spy on everybody&quot; laws.&nbsp; How long before simply using these kind of networks becomes a criminal offense?&nbsp; Without meaning to sound like a conspiraloon, they want to control and monitor every aspect of our lives, and nothing makes them more nervous than people having the ability to communicate and organise in secret.<br /><br />For all it&#039;s usefulness, I don&#039;t see this place as the ultimate answer.&nbsp; It&#039;s just somewhere to regroup before the next assault begins.&nbsp; The psychopaths that govern our lives are determined.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t the type to give up easily.

				I am also very determined, and I am not afraid<br /><br /><br />They cannot and will not ever prosecute Tor use: read the Tor project website.<br /><br />The police, the government, journalists and all sorts of other respected public institutions the world over ALL USE TOR. It&#039;s an invaluable tool to them as much as it is to us, just for different reasons. It simply will not happen (or, if it does, we will definitely be living in an unambiguously authoritarian state. SR shutdown is then the least of our worries).<br /><br />Although those ultimately in charge hold a lot of cards, they have more to lose from attempting to snuff this out than they do from letting it happen. The only control they can exercise at all is how quickly it spreads. That&#039;s it. Unless they want to start down the Bashaar Al-Assad route, of course.

				3 cheers for the president of Guatemala. I am happy to see that governments are starting to say publicly the things that they have known for years. The US government encourages other governments to take the same position they do on drugs and drug use. They also obligated the UN commission on Drugs and Crime to retract their statement saying that prohibition failed and legalization is a more reasonable solution.

				No prohibition means no mega cartels that can afford to bribe thousands of soldiers to defect and work for them. If getting caught with drugs doesn&#039;t mean a life sentence then no motivation for the gang member caught to shoot his way out, or murder informants, or blow up court rooms like they do in Guatemala/Mexico, or shoot customs agents. <br /><br />Take their billion a week in drug profits away and they are left with petty racketeering and stealing truck loads like other mafia, not nearly enough to afford to float a giant private militia <br /><br />

				It&#039;s just going to take a long time.&nbsp; As some other poster said, no matter how &#039;right&#039; it is, no politician in his right mind will come out in favor of decriminalizing drugs, not yet, and government is all bureaucracy, and moves so fucking slow.&nbsp; At these summits, from Arizona to Colombia, they are always saying that we have to &#039;rethink&#039; prohibition, blah blah blah, but here, where we live, nothing gets changed.&nbsp; The best that happens, in &#039;liberal&#039; states, is that you get to cry in front of a judge, and say you &#039;have a disease, your honor,&#039; and get to go to treatment a couple of times, before you get locked up anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m bitter about it.&nbsp; I got addicted to heroin in an american war, and have never really shaken it, and have paid all the prices you pay, if you are a drug addict.&nbsp; Silk Road is the best thing that has really happened to me in a long time, but the hammer is still out there waiting, and I know how little defense I really have against it.&nbsp; I wish I wasn&#039;t a heroin addict, but I am one, and american notion that I am a criminal, (rather than someone to be pitied or scorned or simply fucking ignored), has caused for a tough life. <br /><br />I know one thing: the U.S. will be the last one on the block to legalize, or even decriminalize this shit, so other than liberals yapping about it, I don&#039;t expect much to happen, not now, not for a long time...

				in the end we will win the war on drugs....... we are to many and they are to few, there is no way this is ever going to be won by LE. the cat has been let out the bag, silkroad will continue to grow bigger and bigger its just a matter of time as the word spreads further and further, and even if my worst nightmare came true and silkroad ended there are thousands of people out there with the skills to start a new site, or even by our captain DRP :) this is never ever going to go away DRP has shown the world what is possible, i personally think internet drug sells are going to slowly take over the real dealing world cos its safer for both dealer and user.<br /><br />SR is leading the way in to a new time of freedom for the people who choose for themselves to take these fun and exciting chemicals&nbsp; :) off there own free choice, the sooner the goverment realize the amount of tax that could be made from sales of drugs the better, if it was done properly it could end world poverty, if alcohol was invented today it would be band and made a class A drug. why cant we choose what we want to do with our own bodies? all we want is the right of free choice! <br /><br />DRP you are my personal hero and i just love the way we are sticking our middle fingers up at the law and are saying NO we want our freedom :)<br /><br />LONG LIVE SILKROAD&nbsp; :) :) :) :) :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

In terms of both price and demand.

We all know that legalization is the way to go for every reason you can think of but drugs and the ppl that use drugs (except booze &#039;n&#039; fags ) have been demonized to the point that it will not happen . I could write a 10,000 word essay on this , back it up with facts , stats , statments, empirical evidence from health care professionals but it would make no difference . It is political suicide for any party to suggest legalization of even the most common narcotic ( cannabis ) . Hopefully this will change but I can&#039;t see it happening any time soon . I&#039;ve tried to engage ppl on the tabloid level , <br /><br />Ok , so a crack addict needs £150 a day to support their habit and they burgle to that money . The maths goes :- new goods resold second hand get approx 1/2 of original cost , stolen goods get approx 1/2 of their value . Now these are VERY optimistic figures but we already up to £600 of goods per day to buy something that costs&nbsp; less than 10% of that at source .So shouldn&#039;t we try different route&nbsp; to deal this because what we are doing now plainly does not work ?. ( there is a lot more that goes in here , damage limitation , intervention, help/info/health care at point sale) . And ppl just don&#039;t want to know *sigh* I think/thought education was the key to most of societies ills but the more I see the nihlistic I get .<br /><br />BTW . The &quot;known &quot; universe is 93 BILLION light years across ( google how far light travels in a year ) and you expect me to believe not only was is it created by a being that watches our every move during our life ( don&#039;t get me started about how tiny our 70 years are in the grand design of things) and then judges us after death .

They&#039;re scared). <br /><br />It&#039;s a complete waste of time and resources to arrest people for personal amounts going through the post. It&#039;s also a waste of time and resources to intercept and destroy small amounts. Factor in the current economic and political climate, and this amounts to de facto decriminalization. Law enforcement are aware that several drug crimes are taking place, and they know where to look and who to arrest. But the practicalities of doing it are too much for the system as a whole to bear. The more people that use Silk Road, the more this effect will increase.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just playing the devil&#039;s advocate here...&nbsp; Do Governments fear this new model, or consider it a waste of time to arrest people for shipping personal amounts?&nbsp; I hope the latter.<br /><br />Governments typically make great efforts and spare no expense to ANNIHILATE the things they fear.<br /><br />OTOH, the daily interactions between people here on the Road are, realistically, nothing to be afraid of...&nbsp; Except to those people whose moral sensibilities are so eggshell fragile that the very concept of Silk Road would cause their world view to simply implode.<br /><br />Senators Shumer, Manchin, et al, might just fall into the fragile category.&nbsp; You know, the guys that make laws in the US, and then try to force them on the rest of the world. :)

				Take operation fast and furious as an example.<br /><br />The mexican cartels were basically allowed to transport 60,000 guns to mexico from the USA in &quot;hopes of building a strong case against them to have them extradited and tried. Well, unfortunately, they lost track of over 40,000 of the guns, were only able to retrieve 20,000 by force (who knows the casualties) and over 500 people have been REPORTED of being killed from drug related crimes which could be tracked back to the guns WE sold them. <br /><br />The TRUE profit isn&#039;t in control, it&#039;s in underhanded, tax avoidable, liability devoid transactions. There have been several investigations into the operation and some theories are yielding mexican cartels having bought out members of the force responsible for tracking the weapons, of course. <br /><br />My point being, they make more money on the individual basis by NOT controlling it. If they controlled substances like marijuana and prescriptions with the same tenacity of mexico or the UK then the profit would follow the middlemen and hardly any of it would enter the hands of anybody else.<br /><br />America is a capitalist country now which means the profits always end up in the hands of very few and a small amount of trickles down to other people. The only way this can change is by some huge organization, or strong voiced, well spoken, candidate to bring the reality to life. This can be done through graphs, papers and best of all, powerpoint presentations given on TV. But networks won&#039;t allow this because of the people up top demanding their &quot;constituents&quot; to obey or face the consequences.<br /><br />Security or control, it&#039;s a fine line and one that one day I will hopefully expose for it&#039;s truth.

There can be no justification for taking the right to do so away. And of course, if the system whereby you &quot;keep things to yourself&quot; on the web is going to be in any way effective, it has to be good enough to protect all types of private communication, even those types that others find morally unjustified (of which Silk Road is probably the only contentious example for me, I don&#039;t want a gun or paedophillia or to have someone murdered, and no-one else can successfully argue the right to any of those things in my eyes)<br />

				I agree with your views on privacy entirely.&nbsp; My fear is that the masses do not.&nbsp; Many people will happily post every detail of their lives on FB etc.&nbsp; This is especially true of the younger generation, who are generally considered social outcasts if they don&#039;t also have an interesting and revealing online presence.<br /><br />I feel that those who still value their privacy are in a minority, even moreso when it comes to data collection by faceless corporations.&nbsp; Even though Mr Smith at #23 likes to look at tranny porn, and doesn&#039;t want his wife or friends to know about it, he doesn&#039;t care that google knows, because, in his mind, it will never affect him.<br /><br />It seems to me like very few people still care about privacy online.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(

Many already have their close friends, acquaintances, teachers, parents and extended families in separate Facebook groups, with different abilities to access certain personal information/services such as IM chat or specific photo albums (who wants pictures of themselves and their friends having an unguarded private moment appearing for the benefit of their employers and grandparents?) <br /><br />Private moments should stay private to those concerned, Facebook using teenagers and young adults largely do appreciate this.<br /><br /><br />The Mr Smith&#039;s out there should at least be slightly aware that there is a breadcrumb trail of transvestite pornography related pop-ups seemingly following them around everywhere they go while using Internet Explorer 6. They&#039;ve already got a plethora of excusing statements about why the pop-ups appear, mainly for the benefit of their wives and friends. They&#039;d probably prefer to at least be able to pretend about it all in a convincing way (the wives know, let&#039;s be honest). So, the Mr Smith&#039;s out there should be pretty receptive to arguments about Internet Privacy, even if they do have to make up more excuses to their spouses about why they support it so strongly.

				By some freaky cosmic coincidence, I have had that song going through my head for the last couple of days, despite not hearing it for years.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;ve only fairly recently begun using the onion network in any serious sense, and it brings back memories of what the internet used to feel like.&nbsp; It&#039;s brought it home to me how much I have had to self-censor on clearweb sites, and also highlighted the mistakes I have made with certain clearweb search terms in the past, when I was just growing for myself, and so less concerned about the likelihood of being investigated.<br /><br />In hindsight, it was of course a dumb move to ever access grow sites and google without protection, but how many people actually live their entire lives like that?&nbsp; Me now, obviously, but it&#039;s taken the fact that I am about to commit a fairly serious crime before it even occured to me.&nbsp; :(

				I really believe the best way to change things is targeted assassinations. <br /><br />When/if someone presents a bill to congress for drug legalization, those who vote no is a public record. Most of them are married and have children. Put bullets in the heads of the family members of the members of congress who vote no, and then have another vote.<br /><br /><br />Also, cops are so brazen. I fully believe more of them need to be shot. Then maybe they will lose their zeal.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				What concerns me most about the Conspiracy Theory angle is that, IF it&#039;s all true, then we&#039;re unlikely to survive the struggle. If the major western governments are being manipulated, the psychology of the ultimate manipulators is unlikely to respond well to a sense of embattlement. Their attitude won&#039;t be: &quot;Ah well, it was fun while it lasted, but you guys won! Aren&#039;t you clever with your Bitcoin and Silk Road, I have respect for a smart opponent. Guess I&#039;ll just have to be a nice genocidal megalomaniac from now, live and let live, eh?&quot; <br /><br /><br />If there&#039;s any indication that Bitcoin and Silk Road are going to ruin their plans irretrievably, their final option will be nuclear annihilation from the safety of well stocked, well located bunker.

We all know that legalization is the way to go for every reason you can think of but drugs and the ppl that use drugs (except booze &#039;n&#039; fags ) have been demonized to the point that it will not happen . I could write a 10,000 word essay on this , back it up with facts , stats , statments, empirical evidence from health care professionals but it would make no difference . It is political suicide for any party to suggest legalization of even the most common narcotic ( cannabis ) . Hopefully this will change but I can&#039;t see it happening any time soon . I&#039;ve tried to engage ppl on the tabloid level , <br /><br />Ok , so a crack addict needs £150 a day to support their habit and they burgle to that money . The maths goes :- new goods resold second hand get approx 1/2 of original cost , stolen goods get approx 1/2 of their value . Now these are VERY optimistic figures but we already up to £600 of goods per day to buy something that costs&nbsp; less than 10% of that at source .So shouldn&#039;t we try different route&nbsp; to deal this because what we are doing now plainly does not work ?. ( there is a lot more that goes in here , damage limitation , intervention, help/info/health care at point sale) . And ppl just don&#039;t want to know *sigh* I think/thought education was the key to most of societies ills but the more I see the nihlistic I get .<br /><br />BTW . The &quot;known &quot; universe is 93 BILLION light years across ( google how far light travels in a year ) and you expect me to believe not only was is it created by a being that watches our every move during our life ( don&#039;t get me started about how tiny our 70 years are in the grand design of things) and then judges us after death . Get the fuck outta here , we need to move on from this howling at the moon shit . HAPPY EASTER :-))<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fuck yeah buddy!

				Well, we&#039;re over 6 months on, and I submit to you all again: We&#039;re Winning.<br /><br />- I haven&#039;t been arrested, or in any fear of such a thing<br />- I have ordered vast amounts of Silk Road wares through the post to the various locations I&#039;ve been residing at or visiting during that time. VAST AMOUNTS (+300 BTC spent)<br />- Silk Road is still growing<br />- Bitcoin price hasn&#039;t crashed (well, not much anyways, lol)<br />- Bitcoin network is still growing (the miners)<br /><br />Forget the V for Vendetta mask, I think a Charlie Sheen one would be more the thing.
