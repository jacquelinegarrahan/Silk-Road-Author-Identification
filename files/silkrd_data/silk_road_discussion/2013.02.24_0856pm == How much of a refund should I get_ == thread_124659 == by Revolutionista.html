				I explained to a vendor that tracking was essential before I even placed my order and when it didnt arrive the tracking number turned out to be for a customer on the other side of the world. After providing my postcode again the tracking number still could not be found yet the vendor says the tracked package probably got lost his side of the ocean rather than to say it got sent but got intercepted? I know hes a legit vendor his feedback is flawless so theres not suggestion he did it on purpose something obviously just fucked up but since im on my last address I cant risk taking a reship (hes happy to do this).<br />My point is hes got a 50% refund policy but without the tracking number which was the only reason I ordered how much should I be asking for without being a cunt?<br />

				Or do I accept the 50% ? It just seems the consequences of me possibly burning an address unnecessarily should be factored in somehow

				If it was me I would ask the vendor if he/she would consider a 100% refund and remind them as nicely as I could that I had specifically asked about tracking before ordering. Then I would explain my/your address situation and see what they say.&nbsp; If you have good buying stats and you&#039;re nice about it they might send you 100%.&nbsp; Worth a try anyway.&nbsp; I would give you the 100% just for customer relations sake as long as your stats are decent but that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; Good luck

				Tricky situation here for sure. If it was me I would take the refund over a possibly burned address, depending on how much you care about your refund stats. Where are you located and how much product/cash are we talking about here?<br /><br />I would hope if he is as legit as you believe him to be that he would do the right thing and come to an agreeable and fair resolution, provided it was a mistake on his part. If you believe that it just got lost on its way, then that is no fault of the vendor really. <br /><br />Not sure how it works outside of the states exactly, but if you do end up with a love letter then it would at least give you solace that he did actually send it.

				Iv spent $1400 0% refund 2months <br />Hes 99% 150 transactions. <br />The package is $350 and I could easily go to jail for possession of it even in the uk. <br />Point is I dont think he did send it else he would have the tracking number somewhere plus he tells me he has 100% sucess to my country. <br />

				Well as a vendor who had a similar problem in the past, you could wait a bit to see if the package comes your way or not. As for the refund part, ask him nicely, otherwise he&#039;s going to stick to his 50% refund policy. The error is his, if he&#039;s good hearted and honest he will have no problem refunding you 100% (unless it is a bulk order, that would get more complicated for obvious reasons on BOTH end). If the guy is fully legit, he will be more interested in keeping you as a returning customer than the immediate money :)

It definitely decides on the size of the order to determine the chances of the vendor refunding 100%. If he genuinely is a good vendor he&#039;ll recognize if the error was truly his fault or not and hopefully will handle the situation accordingly.
