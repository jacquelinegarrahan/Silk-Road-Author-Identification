				Hey fellow silk-roadwarriors,<br /><br />I placed an order with a vendor, it is for less than $100USD. Instead of messaging to say it was posted, I got this PM:<br /><br />&quot;Hi, welcome to SR and thanks for your order, we appreciate it.<br />Because you are new you have no purchasing feedback and we as vendors usually ask you to Finalise Early before wesend the good just to make sure you arent a scammer and will cancel the order or something stupid after we send.<br />My feedback speaks for itself and your order is packed and ready to go ans soon as your finalise button appears and you hit it.<br />Again we appreciate your business and this will be the only time you will need to FE (finalise early), you will not need to do it again.&quot;<br /><br />I really can&#039;t fathom this. I&#039;m not a new user, and as far as I know there is no way for a buyer to cancel an order once marked &quot;in transit&quot;, which it now is even though he hasn&#039;t posted anything.<br />Also, don&#039;t vendors see the purchasing stats of users buying from them? Because these are my stats:<br /><br />Total transactions: 79<br />Total spent: $6672.95<br />Refund rate: 3.15%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 7 months<br /><br />I haven&#039;t FE&#039;d for an order since I was a newbie, even vendors with rules about stats and require FE are satisfied with them.<br />What does everyone think? Is this an unreasonable request, or am I unreasonable? It&#039;s less than $100. I have current orders in escrow for more than that, and they&#039;ve already been posted without asking me anything. This has never happened to me before.<br />Any comments or advice would be helpful.<br />Thanks, comrades.<br /><br />P.S. Plus, I had read his whole vendor page and it says NOTHING about FE&#039;ing. If it had I wouldn&#039;t have made a purchase from them. That&#039;s dishonest business practice, I feel.

				First, tell us who the vendor is. This is important information. It isn&#039;t libel to reveal which vendor sent you that message.<br /><br />Secondly, don&#039;t FE. Thirdly, don&#039;t FE.<br /><br />Finally send a message to Support so you have this on record.

				Yeah, I think I will give him the benefit of the doubt and presume it was a mistake.<br />I&#039;ll repeat what I mentioned in the OP.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t go well, Should I post in Customer Support? Or open a support ticket?<br /><br />Funny you mention the skipping town, my refund rate was cause by bloody shithead Winta absconding. He didn&#039;t even ask me to FE though, has to be the dumbest scam ever attempted&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the assistance, I&#039;ll update on my progress&nbsp; :)

				Probably a mistake man, gotta remember vendors have sooo many people ordering they do get mixed up from time to time..<br /><br /><br />I only FE&#039;d once, that was for 2lbs from DarkExpresso bc he said he needed those coins quick, so I trusted him and did and it was no biggie. But go with your gut.

				I did msg him, this was his response;<br />&quot;yeh mate your sweet it should be there today, I posted it xpress yesterday.<br />I sent the message to the wrong customer, it was for someone else sorry mate :P&quot;<br /><br />So no problems, should be here tomorrow.<br /><br />And Winta&#039;s refund didn&#039;t show up, it still said 0%, but I recently had an order not show up; the vendor offered 100% refund, I accepted.<br />This added a refund to my stats, by 3.15% seems like it is now showing the previous Winta refund aswell, I&#039;m not sure. Is 3.09% right with 1 refund and 80 transactions, or is that 2 refunds?

				Just because he said it was a mistake doesn&#039;t mean it was. This vendor could have seen this thread and changed his mind. He could even be sending that message to all of his customers. Then he actually checked your stats and realized you&#039;re not somebody he could fuck over that easily...just a couple ideas. If it was a mistake on his part, I still don&#039;t think it&#039;s okay because he&#039;s requiring somebody to FE. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to sound all negative and shit that&#039;s just what I think. He even could be trying to buy your silence or whatever by upgrading your shipping. I, obviously, have no proof.

				It was probably just an honest mistake. He messaged the wrong buyer. When you have 30 orders processing and you are sending out PM&#039;s it quite easy to send it to the wrong buyer.<br />I&#039;ve done this before but it wasn&#039;t about Fe&#039;ing. It was because there was no data to decrypt when they sent me their address.

				Sounds to me just like what he is: a new vendor.<br />being a vendor is like running a business and honestly&nbsp; he or she probably let their nerves get the best of them and did not type the most articulate or proper response but it doesnt seem malicious <br />I remember the first time i ever sold some weed in high school for some reason i brought a scale out to some kids car to weigh it there thinking theyd want to see their 8th weighed in front of their eyes, we couldnt flind a flat service to weigh , I spilt a bunch of nug and&nbsp; they finally just left. a few years later i had a grow house and three apartments for packing shipping and storage of cash. <br /><br />be easy on the dude. if someone asks you to do something dumb just dont do it and explain why.<br />a few hours ago some kid asked me what state I mail from.<br />obviously im not going to answer that but instead of immediately calling him a cop, i just said &quot;no vendor should ever answer that question, maybe you could tell me why you want to know and we can find a way of answering your question that doesnt require me to give you my location.&quot; turns out he was trying to figure out shipping time to Montana for his friends 16th birthday party I asked him when it was and I allowed him to do a fedex two day. after which he sent me a message telling me it made sense to him now and he felt dumb and thanked me for not jumping on him because apparently he had made another order domestically and asked a weed vendor the same question and he wrote him back calling him a cop and all this shit and cancelled his order so I ended up selling the kid three ounces at 350 per and im not even a weed vendor lol <br /><br />but most importantly all of us on the road need not be so paranoid that we refuse to educate the new buyers and vendors. we are only as strong as our weakest links so lets promote our communities etiquette , which is built on anon. well you are in control of what transactions you make, you are in control of what level of encryption you use and you are in control of what information you give so you should never be scared of some one elses questions or request. instead deny bad questions and bad requests and explain why. if you require pgp and they dont know how to use it then send them a link, if they ask an invasive question, point out the reason its not ok to ask that and MAYBE JUST MAYBE you might prevent them from offering that information up to leo someday once that buyer has become a vendor with 200 addresses laying around the house. maybe just maybe we can prevent new customers and vendors from cutting security corners and threatening the overall safety of the road.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but we have to preach what we practice. <br /><br />

				I would look for an other vendor since he/she is trying to convince you that FE for new buyers is the rule amongst vendors. I&#039;ve FE one time and then the product was never delivered. Had the vendor said that it was their policy to FE with new buyers it would have been something else, but the claim that it is the rule among vendors to have orders finalized early make the vendor seem dishonest.

				another scenario to consider, a lot of vendors are multiple person operations an maybe one of the people that normally mails was filling in to answer questions and there was a miscommunication between the vendors. its happened with us. I would rather try and redeem problems diplomatically so we can don&#039;t miss any opportunity to teach each other one solid system to adhere under when it comes to etiquette because i believe its directly correlated with community safety.&nbsp;
