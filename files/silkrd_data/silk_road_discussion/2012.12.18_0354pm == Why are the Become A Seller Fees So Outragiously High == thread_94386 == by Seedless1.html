				I have been wanting to become a seller on sr and thought the fees were approximately $160.00 - $180.00 and after I went and deposited the money into my bitcoins account I came home and immediately went in to create my sellers account only to find out that the fee is now something like 35 bitcoins which is somewhere around $450.00 to become a seller. That kicks me out of the program!!

				I am a newb so take this with a grain of salt.&nbsp; Complete conjecture on my part.<br /><br />It appears to me they are trying to reduce the number of casual vendors who may be serious<br />or maybe not so serious. It seems they only want to allow those vendors who are serious about running a successful<br />vending operation.&nbsp; $500 is a lot to put up, but if a vendor is serious and has good product and a steady supply,<br />the $500 is really a small start up cost.&nbsp; <br /><br />But who knows, maybe they just want more $.

				It&#039;s to discourage scammers from collecting money under one vendor account and jumping to the next.<br /><br />It is also to discourage people just like the OP, no offense intended, because if 500 dollars is his main concern, then he probably has not done ALL of the needed reading about vending. There are far more important things to think about before you start a vendor account..... learn security and stealth methods.

The fee should be high enough to discourage (a) scamming and then buying a new account; (b) noob vendors who have tenuous connections or don&#039;t think about what it actually takes to be a good vendor - hence they can never be reliable vendors and are a liability rather than an asset.<br /><br />It should serve as as barrier to entry, basically, which is low enough that it allows anyone who really wants to be a vendor to be one, but discourages scammers and noobs.

				While I completely agree with the OP, I have to still agree with the other comments in this thread.&nbsp; I think that $500 is pretty damn steep (especially for someone that is just starting out), but in the light of preventing shitty sellers and scammers, it is quite a small fee to pay.&nbsp; I say to the OP, just save your money (sell some product! LOL), and pay when you can.&nbsp; The road is not going anywhere (HOPEFULLY!), so you have time to make it happen.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK!

				MMMNNNN....<br />And the number of vendors x $500 has nothing to do with it.....<br />Its income, on top of fees you have to pay this.<br />The amount....nicely calculated what a vendor would be wanting to pay to sell. It could be less but why do that?<br />And for the ones saying &#039;&#039;yeah but this is to keep out scammers.....&#039;&#039;<br />WHAT ABOUT THIS ??<br />After so many sales 50 OR 100?/ sales amount 15000 dollar? you GET THE 500 DOLLAR BACK IN YOUR ACCOUNT BECAUSE.....RIGHT... YOU WERE NO SCAMMER !!<br />Would this be fair, damn right because you already pay fees. Why should you BUY YOUR WAY IN? <br />Anyway....you will never win these discussions because....the ones making the decisions just....make the decisions.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Personally I would like the fee raised to 1-2k. After 100 sales you get half back for those that don&#039;t make a lot of money per transaction that would even the playing field. But honestly if you can&#039;t afford 1k then you don&#039;t need to vend here. This isn&#039;t something to be done lightly and I would like to be associated with a better base of vendors then some that came into the scene as of recent. So many guys wanting to jump in sell for a month and jump out. We need consistent vendors pushing quality and quantity. We don&#039;t need your nickle dime riff raff around mucking up our REAL businesses. These types of vendors tend to disregard peoples safety which is inexcusable to me.

				Well sir..... I don&#039;t have to refresh for 4-8 hrs a day. In fact I&#039;m logged in right now to my vendor account and can freely move about the site and my money is all there. Sounds honestly like you either don&#039;t have the most updated version of TOR, or its a combo of your ISP just not liking the wait time on page loads. Either way this isn&#039;t something that happens to everyone so please stop acting like the sky is falling when an exploit is found. You want no bugs? Go back to windows 3.1.

				I don&#039;t know about you guys, but when I signed up, I thought $150 was &quot;steep&quot;.. since being a vendor here, I have easily multiplied that $150 considerably... If you know what you&#039;re doing and you&#039;re ready to make the COMMITMENT (this isn&#039;t Amazon here), then the initial account price is pennies on the dollar compared to your future revenue.<br /><br />Besides, I easily burn through $500+ of supplies in a month. The initial price is nothing compared to ongoing/continuing costs.<br /><br />One last thought. It&#039;s like an association fee, when I go to the tennis club, I pay $200 a month whether I play there or not, but you can bet that as soon as I pay that money, I am spending my every waking moment making the best use of the facilities. Your $500 initial investment will guarantee that you will spend your every waking moment running a business and doing it as best you can.

It&#039;s a principle based on the writer Seth Godin&#039;s book Tribes. Might want to pick it up sometime as it is a great read for building small businesses. The type of tribes collected from SR are generally going to be younger more tech savy individuals that would enjoy a good show when people like me and Limitless poke the bear so to speak. You are the one I simply don&#039;t understand though. You have said fuck SR and that you are leaving but you still stick around just to argue in a forum that you will not make money on. At least my ploys and tomfoolery are staged stunts meant to bring more people into my fold and check out my links so that I can make more money. Spending time in a support section of a business isn&#039;t a waste of a time but an investment in my hopefully long term relationship with the site and it&#039;s members. So the next time you want to call people out for what they do you might just want to think if your words will just fuel the fires of my obvious PR stunts that will eventually make me more successful and ultimately more profitable than you while you simply look foolish.

Therefore it&#039;s good to have high vendor-fees.<br /><br />IMHO if we go down this road, the possibility is very high, that we will end up having &quot;monopolies&quot; and &quot;cartels&quot;, same like IRL! And this is NEVER EVER good for the customer.<br /><br />The equation: small vendor = scammer / big vendor = good dady isn&#039;t the reality I&#039;ve learned here. I see how the TOP-Vendors here (at least in the coke-section) do dirty tricks &amp; shadow marketing all day long...<br /><br />So I would plead for quite the opposite: enable small vendors to come in here! Or otherwise we will end up having some BIG DEALERS here (I think we already have) which are connected behind the scenes, so they could manipulate the whole thing. And this is the moment, when this community will fall apart!<br /><br />GREED always secures it&#039;s own destruction and the subject which is exercising it.<br /><br />Hulk<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this I totally agree with.<br />I have the idea that already a few are trying to keep as many out as they can.&nbsp; You see them here on the forum trying to figure out how to scare them off if you read their comments.<br />They think they are smart but the more vendors the more people will be satisfied customers and vendors have to be on their toes to keep up quality and service so everybody wins.<br />By treating the new ones wrong, being rude, trolling or not want to help the slightest bit they try to scare them of and often that works I think.<br />A new vendor who try to see here on the forum what it is all about is being scrutinized for a simple question.<br />I said it before, all those &#039;&#039;old&#039;&#039; vendors knew everything the minute they started and never asked a question that was not already asked/answered? <br />If somebody asks and I know the answer and be able to help why shouldn&#039;t I? I be here anyway at that time for whatever reason.<br />Anyway....the more the merrier&nbsp; <br /><br />The fee is not to high but there could be an other system if it only is to keep out scammers.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				$500 is not a large fee to open a vendor&#039;s account IMO. Regardless of the size of the vendor&#039;s operation, if you can&#039;t afford a $500 start-up fee, your never going to last. I must say black83, based on what you have posted, you are no where near ready to open a vending account. You also don&#039;t seem to have the the knowledge or skills to maintain your security, including both yours and your customer&#039;s sensitive information. Most importantly though, will be your ability to retain your anonymity. The skills required to do this aren&#039;t too hard to learn, but it&#039;s vitally important you understand and implement them correctly for all concerned. Don&#039;t want to sound rude, just being honest.

This is the marketing hub for SR and many vendors promote their wares here, and do so successfully. I can see where your coming from however promoting your business and increasing your customer base would take precedence IMO. This place is full of idiots and is far from the great place it once was. Glad to hear you know what your doing and I&#039;m not worried in the slightest.
