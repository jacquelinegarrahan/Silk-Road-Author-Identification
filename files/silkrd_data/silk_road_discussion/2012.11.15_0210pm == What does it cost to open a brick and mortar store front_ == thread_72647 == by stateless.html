				So to start up for example a thrift store in down town Chicago lets say.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some place that is busy enough, and has a spot open.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />There is a shit load you have to pay for.&nbsp; The building, the liability insurance, the utilities, the advertising, inventory, etc..&nbsp; You could be into it $100,000, and it would take you a great deal more time to come up with the revenue that SR is coming up with even with all of that investment.<br /><br />Imagine you wanted to open up a cannabis dispensary.&nbsp; Not farkin cheap.&nbsp; Most people are into it a bare minimum of $50k to get started right.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what if we were making ass loads of money on Silk Road and the possibly DPR got pinched, killed, or just died in a freak accident.<br /><br />What would you do?<br /><br />I think it would be wise to take some of your plunder, hire a developer.&nbsp; Pay them&nbsp; $5000 to build a bad ass Silk Road imitation site.&nbsp; <br />Make that sucker OPEN SOURCE so that the community can continue to improve it, close security leaks, etc.<br /><br />Then your store front continue to stay up to date with the latest technology to defend against the latest threats, and other people get to open shop too with well designed software.<br /><br />If any of you hustlers have an extra 500 BTC, I would drop it on some web development QUICK.&nbsp; Before life takes it&#039;s course and SR is no more.<br /><br />And while BMR is cool, I still don&#039;t feel like BMR is 100% secure.<br /><br />With open source you can get a lot of different minds behind it, and the product almost always turns out better than for profit commercial software.<br /><br />
