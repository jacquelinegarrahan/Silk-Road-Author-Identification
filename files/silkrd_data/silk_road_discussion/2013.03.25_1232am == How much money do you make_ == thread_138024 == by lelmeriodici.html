				Just curious as to what the demographics of the SR community are.&nbsp; The high-tech nature of the process would incline me to thinking middle and upper class, but the stereotypes about drugs would certainly have you thinking the other way...&nbsp; I hope its not too much to ask, I tried to make the brackets somewhat discreet (there&#039;s no 300k and up option) without making them useless.<br /><br />If you really want to contribute, post how much of your income you spend on SR each year in addition to how much you make.<br /><br />And before anyone asks: yes, I am a law enforcement officer living in your jurisdiction, and I will arrest and personally prosecute you if you click an answer to this poll.&nbsp; ;)

				If he&#039;s asking how much your making off of Silk Road then I think your right.&nbsp; But, if he&#039;s asking what your legal income bracket is, I don&#039;t think that should be a problem.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not asking how much people make off SR, just income bracket.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to share information then why would you create a forum account?&nbsp; And besides, name one single case where an internet forum poll was used as evidence.

				No problem, it&#039;s an interesting poll. I can&#039;t say how much per year &#039;cause I&#039;m only here about 2 months. I would say I will spend less than 2,000 dollars in a year though.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve been a member for about a month so I haven&#039;t had any regular activity to figure out how much I&#039;ll spend here each year.. I hope it&#039;s not too much!<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve spend about $400 on SR (in a month) and I make 70,001 to 100,000 USD a year.

Pretty much gave up ever working for a company (thats not my own) period, way to much time away from the fam and way to much money spent on everything/everybody but me! Yea I&#039;m miserable but I have a great feeling this site will get me much closer to my goals in life.

				The better question would be, how much love do you give, how much love do you invest in the way you earn money, and how much money really stay in your pocket?<br />And is really cash more important? then the good karma and the amount of love with which you make the people around you happy ?<br />Do cash or your high bank account and the tones of paper make you really satisfied?<br /><br /><br />Peace n greets
