				expect the bitcoin price to continue to drop. To avoid loosing any money make your purchase asap before the market fluctuates.

				I have seen listings that are quadruple what they should be, even in the highest quality when it isn&#039;t. Not sure if this is a way for a vendor to put pause on a listing, or if because BTC are hitting major lows.<br /><br />- IW

				The price for an item stays the same even when the btc value goes up and down. You are just losing money when the price of bitcoins drops. I bought 5 btc last week at like 85 dollars a peice now I can&#039;t buy anything because I&#039;d be losing close to a third of my money.&nbsp; I wish I knew when they were heading back up because I really need some mdma pills . But hey maby ill buy some more coins soon then if it went up I&#039;d make money. God its got me stressing!!!
