I do hope this practice isn&#039;t too widespread though.<br /><br />If my memory serves me right, there was a previous thread where a vendor became very suspicious about a buyer and Googled their name. They found a bunch of shit on Facebook about how this person was some kind of pro-drug activist and was being a bit of a load mouth about their Silk Road activities. They didn&#039;t release any personal details on these forums though.<br /><br />I&#039;m OK, but the idea a vendor is researching a mailing name they&#039;ve been given does make me feel a little bit uncomfortable.

				yeah but still just googling someones name isn&#039;t gonna tell you that the person is well known by post and police unless he called them himself which would be a dick move but that seems about the only way the post office and police would be watching for this guy so are you fucking snitch?

How about google through tor?<br /><br />Have to make sure the person ordering is not asking you to ship to say the local police department address. Especially when the person ordering lists his name as <br /><br />Officer XXXXX XXXXX, Sgt XXXXX XXXXX, Or SA XXXXX XXXXX, etc&nbsp; :o<br /><br />

				As a buyer I would be check Google to make sure my drop name doesn&#039;t show up.<br /><br />As a vendor, you must know if LE&nbsp; gets your computer, they may be able to track your searches.<br /><br />Then what would LE do? Not much I think, but I could be wrong.<br />Puts a new twist on things. Stay safe!<br />
