				Hi all,<br /><br />If you have any good anecdotes/stories/dramas or links to really cool threads, I&#039;d love to hear them.&nbsp; Whether your own anecdotes or stories you recall from the earlier days of SR.&nbsp; Preferably via PM or email (my email address is on the &#039;about&#039; page of my site).<br /><br />As some of you know, I&#039;m writing a book. It&#039;s not an &#039;expose&#039; but a book that looks at the rise of online drug markets against a backdrop of the increasingly-futile &#039;War on Drugs&#039;.&nbsp; But I want it to be an enjoyable read as well, thus the request for your stories.<br /><br />Yes, I have DPR&#039;s blessing to do this :)<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them publicly or by PM and I&#039;ll do my best to answer them.&nbsp; There&#039;s already a bit of discussion about the pros and cons of writing a book on SR in this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171238.15<br /><br />To get a feel for the kinds of things I write, please visit allthingsvice.com.<br /><br />If you prefer to encrypt communications, a link to my PGP public key is in my sig, or its on the &#039;about&#039; page of All Things Vice.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you<br /><br />x Eiley<br />

				I didn&#039;t know if you were serious, so I Googled it. There is in fact an HBO series called Silk Road, and most articles about it speculate that it&#039;s about this Silk Road. Intriguing.

				The book sounds interesting, and I might end up offering a few anecdotes myself, but can I just say that I do not envy the poor sod who&#039;ll end up fact-checking your work? <br /><br />&quot;Dear Mr. SR Vendor. I&#039;m OzFreelancer&#039;s editor&#039;s assistant, and I just have a few questions for you regarding your PM about your recent sales of contraband on Silk Road. Now, was it 1 000 pills or 10 000 pills that customs seized? Also, can you confirm that you were one of the first ten vendors on SR, and that you used to conduct security audits at one of the larger UK tech companies?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Bugger off. I deny everything.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

I hope that any contributors offer input publicly, though: it&#039;ll help with the accuracy and will mean that the book won&#039;t reveal anything additional to those who&#039;d like to see SR put away. <br /><br />And I am very much looking forward to the end result. It sounds like it&#039;ll be an enjoyable thing to write, much less read!

				This girl came to BMR forum asking for somebody to kill her.&nbsp; She was offering her own organs as payment.<br /><br />http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewtopic.php?id=3573<br /><br />Surprisingly, nobody took her up on the offer and instead convinced her to reconsider.
