				Received my order from electronicdeals. I used a new screen name as to separate my drug account from my non-illegal items account which is why this is my first post. I will have a vendor or mod verify that I am a respected member of the forums or SR. Anyways here is the review for the TV i received which I am very pleased with:<br /><br /><br /><br />Finalizing Early and giving this guy a chance as he seems to be a legit vender with unheard of prices on his electronics. Will be updating with a full review when TV is received.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-4: Still awaiting tracking number<br /><br />UPDATE later 12-4: Didn&#039;t need tracking number. Received the TV the very next day after it was shipped, very impressed. Only downside to this transaction was that I had originally placed an order for a 46&quot; Samsung but received a 47&quot; Vizio (equipted with full HD and 3D) so I cant really complain. Also when checking the model number against the same TV being sold online, I got the VIZIO for over 50% off. TV looks brand new no scratches or lines in the screen. Came with a new remote, 2 pairs of 3D glasses and a user manual.<br /><br />Summery for this transaction:<br />5/5 for not fucking me over for finalizing early<br /><br />5/5 for quality of the TV received. Saved a unbelievable amount of money compared to what they are going for online. If this TV isn&#039;t brand new, I would have no idea.<br /><br />4.5/5 for communication. It was strong at first but I never did get the tracking number for the TV even after he said he would give it and I sent a follow-up message. But who the fuck needs tracking when its comes overnight anyways?<br /><br />4/5 for sending me a TV that I didn&#039;t order. Although it is bigger and has more functions that the original TV I ordered. It would have been nice for you to tell me that the samsung I had ordered had some complications and that you would be sending a Vizio. Really not a fan of Vizio but I&#039;m selling it anyways for some quick cash so I cant complain too much.<br /><br />7/5 for price. I paid $275 for a $700 TV. This by itself is why this vender is getting a 5/5 total ranking from me and I will continue to do business with him as well as recommend him to others. <br />

				blueballs contacted me on his regular account and told me to vouch for him here. He&#039;s legit. Might want to move this tread to the Product offers or rumor mill section though.<br /><br />Cheers

				Thanks Xander7! And it is my understanding that he doesn&#039;t require FE unless you are a new buyer. This was technically my first transaction under this new name.

				The box itself did not say vizio on it but I can&#039;t say for sure if that it wasn&#039;t from the factory or refurbish company. The tv itself inside the he box was definitely professionally.packaged like a factory would do. Like I said, if it wasn&#039;t a new tv I would have no idea.
