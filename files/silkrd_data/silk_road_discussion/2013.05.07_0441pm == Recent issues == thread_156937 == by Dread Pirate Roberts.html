				thank for keeping us informed.<br />the site is working just fine for me since this afternoon... so I hope that&#039;ll be the case for everyone and that you&#039;ll have some time to light a joint, drop some acid and have a drink or a nice rock of MDMA to go with the acid &amp; enjoy yourself a little to get rid of all that stress you&#039;ve had over the last week(s)... <br />if you need company I can bring the acid&nbsp; ;D

				DPR, you are the man! I say this over and over again but myself and my family cannot thank you enough! Just a month and a half ago I had lost my career of over 15 years and financially things were getting bad for me. I had always been in the &quot;game&quot; in my younger years but I am to old to be doing any &quot;street style&quot; sales so actually being able to anonymously sell product to a huge customer base is literally a dream come true :) The subblemented income I make from vending here is helping me and my family live a better life and I owe it ALL to you. The site is running BEAUTIFULLY! I may be a new vendor but I have had a seperate buyer account for over a year and in that whole time I do not think the site has ever run this fast and perfect! Last night a withdrawal did take longer than usual but it arrived fine and I see you have fixed that issue so that&#039;s awesome! I honestly do not even mind the slight glitch of being logged off every once in a while if the site keeps operating like this! :)<br /><br />Thanks again SO much for everything you&#039;ve done DPR. You are a legend.

				Many thanks to the team, to be honest I can&#039;t understand a lot of the complaining. If you expect no occasional problems when you buy things on the internet go to amazon and buy a book. We are in new territory here expect issues, report problems with grace and be grateful for what we have.&nbsp; &nbsp;
