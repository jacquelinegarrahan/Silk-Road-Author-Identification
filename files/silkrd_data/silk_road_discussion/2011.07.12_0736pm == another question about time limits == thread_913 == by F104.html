				Do most of you cancel if the order isn&#039;t in transit within the 4 day processing period? If the vendor doesn&#039;t communicate, like say &quot;Hey, it will take me an extra day to get it out&quot; then I think all buyers should cancel their orders. If&nbsp; there is nearly no communication and the option comes up to cancel and If i&nbsp; have no idea when I will be getting it? You bet, ill cancel really fast...<br /><br />This is why communication is so important. I can&#039;t believe all the vendors that respond 2 or 3 days after the pm was sent, let alone read.... If I had an issue sending something out, you bet your bottom dollar that the client is going to know whats going on every step of the way....

				SWIM used to, in the dino days of the early 00&#039;s, do a lot of online selling.&nbsp; <br /><br />I found that if I didn&#039;t respond to messages within 24 hours, more than 50% of the buyers would send a second message; thereby just adding to the problem.<br /><br />So, it made sense for me AND the buyers that I only take on as many orders as I could reasonably process in any 24 hour period.&nbsp; Making allowances for day jobs, kids, gf, sleep, etc, whatever applies.<br /><br />SR is sooooo much more sophisticated.&nbsp; A seller can simply control their inflow by being very vigilant about removing listings when they get &quot;enough&quot; orders.&nbsp; Even if they can&#039;t get back to all the people who messaged that day.&nbsp; At least it stops the new messages from flooding in.&nbsp; They&#039;ll still get some, but not nearly so many.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine how many messages a popular vendor gets on SR with 10,000+ users.&nbsp; I was on a forum with *maybe* 800 people and got about 100 messages every day; 85% orders.&nbsp; Even that was basically a second full-time job!<br /><br />Just an idea.&nbsp; Free advice; worth what it costs.&nbsp; :)

				As a buyer I would totally cancel after 4 days - except then you can not leave negative feed. Having your funds for however long it takes just to file a complaint just so you can leave feedback is a lot to ask. <br /><br />There are a few exception. One of the times Silk Road went down for 4 days a few of GreenCo&#039;s customer&#039;s could have marked canceled. The orders actually shipped but GreenCo could not log on to mark &quot;shipment confirmed&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;It is pretty inconvenient to the Buyer if the Seller marks canceled, sellers should really never cancel any order.

				@F104 That is lame. They had 4 days to work it out, and not even a message. There should be some feedback on Sellers who waste your time and&nbsp; cancel orders.

				Well this just happened to me and maybe acouple others...not sure...ordered wednesday and two days went by and still said processing...i went to his user info and he posts something like &quot;got out as many as i could..going on vacation back monday&quot;....wtf so he shipped some orders and not others and now i got a bunch of money i could have used on another vendor and got my stuff. If you cant handle the amt of orders then dont leave the listing up.

				NOt me: I give sellers quite a bit of slack.&nbsp; I&#039;ll usually pm after a day or so, see what&#039;s up, but if it&#039;s a new seller, I figure they may be new to the game, and I don&#039;t want to hassle them...after a week maybe I&#039;ll get a little more aggresive, but I&#039;ve seen some pretty good sellers get kind of hounded out of this biz by paranoid buyers who seem to think they are at walmart or something...so I presume good will, and yeah, I&#039;ve had products fall thru, but sellers have always made it right, and generally I get along good with sellers.&nbsp; If they come thru, after the first time, I life escrow as soon as order is processed.&nbsp; We expect too much sometimes...

				@phubaiblues wow Your are way mellow, which is good, but I think your expectations should be a little higher. There are a lot of professional Sellers and I think buyers should have high standards. Flaky slacker marijuana dealers really is not ok and buyers should not have to wait a week just to see if some seller picks up the money and then, maybe sometime later, decides to send it.<br /><br />I think professionalism is a reflection on what you can expect for security. You are just not as safe buying from a seller who does not take it seriously. If a seller is willing to let some stuff slide what if they are less than diligent about your address. They themselves are more likely to get caught themselves and when they do compromise their customers.<br /><br />For all of our safety, let&#039;s hold all sellers to a pretty high standard.

				It shits me when a seller marks the transaction as in transit after 2 days and then sends a message after another two asking whether I want to change shipping methods.

				^ Yeah that&#039;s pretty garbage.&nbsp; I have only ever once marked a package as shipped before I actually had it out the door, and that&#039;s because I was going to be away overnight and I was dropping off the package on the way, so I wanted to let the buyer know it was shipped that day.<br /><br />That should be a big no-no.&nbsp; Getting blindsided by attempted addons or whatever else is a bit of a slap in the face for a buyer.
