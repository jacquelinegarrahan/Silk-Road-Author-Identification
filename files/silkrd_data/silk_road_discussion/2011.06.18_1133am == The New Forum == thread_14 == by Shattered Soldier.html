				I think its nice to have a place to go to calm our nerves during an outage.&nbsp; I&#039;m just a little disappointed that all of the older threads got killed because many of them were still active.&nbsp; I guess we&#039;ll have to start from scratch.

				1. shouldn&#039;t have to enter an email. I tried registering my old name with a fake email and it didn&#039;t let me sign in. It worked after I created a dummy acct on yahoo and used that.<br /><br />2. migration could have gone a lot better. I don&#039;t like the fact that I can easily register with a trusted seller&#039;s name right now. I imagine this is going to be a big headache for SR.

				I like it alright: the links made me have to sign up again, but I&#039;m new anyway, and over the last week, i&#039;ve gotten kind of used to &#039;signing in&#039;&nbsp; ;D ...and not getting anywhere...but so far, so good ...

				If your posts aren&#039;t showing up, or if it&#039;s saying you aren&#039;t logged in, try reloading and bypassing the cache (probably hold Ctrl when you refresh, depending on browser).<br /><br />BTW, I was able to register with a fake email address. Left it blank the first time and got an error message, tried again with a fake email and it said I&#039;d already registered a few seconds earlier, logged in and the fake one is in my profile now.

Why would you require an email address? If we wanted to give personal information, we wouldn&#039;t be using Tor and shopping with Bit Coins. How many of the email addresses used do you think are actually real email addresses?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
