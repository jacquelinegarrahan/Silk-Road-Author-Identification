				I have just spent an hour reaching the minimum of 50 posts requirement in order to have permission to post here so any help will be truly appreciated.<br /><br />I ordered some H from c63amg last week on Thursday 26th September. He asked me to FE and marked it in transit the next day Friday 27th...( this was last Friday exactly 7 days ago from today ).<br /><br />Unfortunately it has not arrived yet and half the order belonged to a good friend of mine. Usually it doesn&#039;t take so long to arrive (I live in central Europe) so my questions are<br /><br />Has anyone who ordered around the same time as myself or after, Did you receive the package?. did you FE? <br /><br />I ask because around the 29th he said he was very busy and im thinking that the site may have been siezed before he had a chance to sent it. <br /><br />Also a heads up there is a new user called c63amg_official claiming to be him but when i asked about my order he said he will check. (so far no info on my order just a pm letting me know he is accepting orders again) be careful since its a new account.<br /><br />I wish c63amg would contact us because he was the best and very professional... I will let you all know if i find out anything more.

				i reckon he&#039;s just riding it out atm, i don&#039;t blame him.<br /><br />thanks to c63 taking an extra day to send my shit he actually saved me £90. i was gonna put that amount of btc into the road wednesday morning ready to make an order, but my order from c63 finally turned up wednesday morning and i went on a crack binge and never got round to buying the btc. i was still fucking high as a kite when i found out the road had been seized. <br /><br />c63, thx for that mate, i did finalize wednesday morning but my guess is you would never have had time to cash out, sorry for the loss. i&#039;m sure we&#039;ll see you again when the heat has died down tho. till then much luck to you.<br /><br />best seller on the road by far.

				I was waiting for a delivery from c63 and it never showed. It should have been shipped before the shutdown so it doesn&#039;t make sense. I didn&#039;t send the drop address encrypted as I&#039;m a bit of a noob and was only a tiny order, my bad :(. I can&#039;t imagine it was intercepted, I just hope c63 is still around and sets up shop again as he was by far the best source for my preferred poison.

Also many accounts don&#039;t have any public keys so I am slightly doubtful about them.
