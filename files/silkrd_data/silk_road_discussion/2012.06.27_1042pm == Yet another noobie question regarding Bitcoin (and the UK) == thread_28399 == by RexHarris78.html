				Sorry about this, I seem to have spent ages trying to crack the whole concept of getting credit in the form of &#039;bitcoin&#039; into my SR account. <br /><br />I have transferred money from my bank to MtGox in the hope I can buy some of these bitcoins and transfer them to SR. (I relise I&#039;m getting the terminology wrong).&nbsp; <br /><br />Is this exactly the wrong thing to do??<br /><br />Any pointers/suggestion very much appreciated.<br />Thanks<br />Rex

				Seem to be doing everything OK so far.<br /><br />Make sure you use a service such as bitcoinfog between MtGox and SilkRoad to make your Bitcoins anonymous.<br /><br />OZ

				Great. Thanks for your reply Oz. Is that an easy thing to do? Seems straight forward but maybe I&#039;m just not getting it.

				Yes it&#039;s that simple. I don&#039;t know why they are over complicating things. <br /><br />Personally I use Intersango rather than MtGox though as in the UK they are faster.<br /><br />Sometimes it takes a couple of hours for your transfer to Silk Road to appear, don&#039;t worry about this, it&#039;s normal and due to the way Bitcoins work. The central database isn&#039;t live and updates periodically.

				Thanks OZ, that&#039;s really reassuring. I didn&#039;t go with Intersango in the end because they&#039;ve made a lot of noises about their disgust of Silk Road. They seem to making a particular point of distancing themselves. <br /><br />How do you transfer money to Intersango? Direct from your bank? Is it much quicker than MtGox? (they say it&#039;ll take 3 days).<br />Cheers<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28399.msg312167#msg312167">Quote from: oscarzululondon on June 27, 2012, 11:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes it&#039;s that simple.

				I&#039;ve transferred money twice to intersango straight from my bank account (UK) and it appeared in my account both times within an hour or two.

				Hmm. I transferred money to mtgox yesterday from my bank and it&#039;s still pending. I think I read it&#039;ll take 3 goddam days. Do you then route it to bitcoinfog?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28399.msg313588#msg313588">Quote from: CyborgUK on June 28, 2012, 01:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve transferred money twice to intersango straight from my bank account (UK) and it appeared in my account both times within an hour or two.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				<br />I just send straight to SR wallet direct from intersango, not the safest method but I&#039;m only an occasional buyer here so i&#039;m not to worried about getting busted.
