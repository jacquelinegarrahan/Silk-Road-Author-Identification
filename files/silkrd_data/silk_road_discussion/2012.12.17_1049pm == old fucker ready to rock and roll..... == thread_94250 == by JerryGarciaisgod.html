				OK Howdy peeps :-*<br /><br />Im a 52 year guy who stretched his computer skills to the max to get here.&nbsp; I know I;m a dumbass but remember.... I grew up with a black and white tv with 3 channels and no remote.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;ve arrived at silkroad, My head is about to explode from the bitcoin hassle.&nbsp; I get it but damn I just want a simple way to get my cash converted - so many options, so many hoops to go through and not sure whom to trust<br /><br />&nbsp;Mr Garcia sang &quot;all good things in all good time&quot; but I&#039;d really like to get some favors for my NYE with NMAS.&nbsp; Can someone please take me by the hand and spoon feed me the easiest way to convert a few hundred bucks into electronic currency<br /><br />thanks so much

				I had posted to a thread about this yestarday. A cash to bitcoin method that I used for the first time yesterday.<br /><br />Go start a free wallet at blockchain.info.<br />Log into your wallet<br />Push Cash Deposit<br /><br />&nbsp;Amount:<br />$<br />Enter the amount to purchase in USD. 1 BTC = $ 13.28 (3.99% Fee)<br />Make Anonymous?<br />*Checkbox Option<br />The bitcoins will be sent through our mixer for improved privacy (1.5% Fee).<br /><br />There will be simple instructions following on the Bitinstant page..... choose option deposit cash Walmart<br /><br />This method uses Bitinstant<br />This method uses Blockchain&#039;s method for Anonymizing.<br />I think it is cheaper that bitcoinfog<br />

				Welcome!&nbsp; You sound a little like me a few months ago.&nbsp; I&#039;m 46 and had not experienced the pleasure of smoking weed in NINE FUCKING YEARS. I just didn&#039;t have easy, safe access to it.&nbsp; Thanks to the Silk Road, I&#039;m enjoying it again. <br /><br />Getting bitcoins is definitely the biggest pain in the ass about all of this.&nbsp; The last time I got some I used Blue Sky Traders - they have many happy customers here on the forum.&nbsp; If you have convenient access to a Bank of America branch, they are the way to go in my opinion.&nbsp; It&#039;s totally anonymous.&nbsp; Their website:<br /><br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br />&nbsp;

Sure, the money might be used for questionable purchases, but he&#039;s doing something completely legal, and the person buying Euros with USD is totally anonymous to him.

				thanks y&#039;all<br /><br />Wow - I was worried that no one would be willing to answer my questions or that I&#039;d get the hammer to the head for asking stupid newbie questions. I&#039;m gonna head on over to BOA tomorrow.<br /><br />I live in USA - Virginia to be specific. Own several businesses, employ 40 some people and love recreating <br /><br />Kept a weed connection all through children but not much else. Like all kinds of recreational stuff but don&#039;t like dealing with the standard issues scoring locally as in users who sell, my name being out there in public and frankly the time it takes to score.&nbsp; This place is absolutely brilliant and a long way from my days of flying from Denver to DC with suitcases loaded to the brim with Shrooms. I was an idiot but today you&#039;d last about 30 seconds trying that <br /><br />Again thanks for the warm welcome and I look forward to sharing both the good times and the comraderie that comes from being here.
