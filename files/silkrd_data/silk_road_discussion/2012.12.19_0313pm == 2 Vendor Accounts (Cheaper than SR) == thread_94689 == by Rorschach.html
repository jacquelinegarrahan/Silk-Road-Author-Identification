				Hello guys, before you start eating shit that I&#039;m a scammer and all sorts of bullshit. Read what I&#039;m about to say.<br /><br />In August when I discovered SR, I upgraded 3 accounts to seller hoping that one day the prices will grow. <br />Well, that day is here apparently and I can sell 2 of the accounts as I would like to keep one for me.<br /><br />The accounts do not have any transactions or listings. They are blank, totally blank.<br /><br />For obvious reasons I can not tell you the name of the accounts here but contact me via PM.<br /><br />I want $300 for each.<br /><br />Cheers. Contact me via PM.

				So once the person buys the account and builds good feedback what is to stop you from asking for more money or reveal that it was a sold account and get it banned?<br /><br />Not saying that is what you would do but the fact that you could will make this sort of sale problematic. You can&#039;t get the trust you need to sell these accounts as far as I can see.<br /><br />What kind of vendor would want to start out by breaking the rules and risking account ban to save $200 anyways?

				When you start out your proposition with &quot;In August when I discovered SR, I upgraded 3 accounts to seller hoping that one day the prices will grow&quot; you will immediately turn prospective buyers off. Because you&#039;re coming off like a douche by saying &quot;hey guys, you&#039;re all incapable of looking forward&quot;. <br />

				I don&#039;t see how they are worth $300 when considering the risks involved &amp; the fact that if your becoming a seller you will hopefully be turning over enough to make that $200 savings moot. I&#039;m sure lots will be interested but I just can&#039;t think of anyway to protect both buyer and seller... Would SR &quot;police&quot; not just pretend to be buying them off you until they can find out what the seller accounts are &amp; shut them down?
