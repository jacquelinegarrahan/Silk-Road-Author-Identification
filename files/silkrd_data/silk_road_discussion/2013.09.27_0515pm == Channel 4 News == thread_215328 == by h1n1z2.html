				All Anchor&#039;s today remind me of the Tom Grunick character in the movie Broadcast News. When they try to ad-lib something it really shows. For example, watching CNN after the Navy yard shooting John King turns to Anderson Cooper and explains &quot;The suspect used a cartridge called &quot;buckshot&quot; in his high powered fast reloading pump action 870 Remington. This is the type of heavy duty ammunition used by hunters for big game, Deer, Bear, ect.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;LOL<br /><br />Not impressed John.

				you know these forums really need a huge sticky in the noob forum telling people that if they get caught on the street with the drugs they bought of sr, that they should absolutely never tell the cops they bought them off the road. <br /><br />like the guy was saying in the video, only about 14% of drug users are buying online and its a minimal problem really. but the more idiots keep blabbing their mouths off to the cops about where they got them here, the worse the cops will see the problem.<br /><br />ffs people, if you get caught in possession then just tell the cops you bought it of some random guy in a club or street corner somewhere. it does nothing at all what so ever to help your defense to tell the cops you bought off the road. in fact if they look at your computer and see that you&#039;ve ordered from abroad then you could even face an importation charge. <br /><br />the less the cops hear from users they arrest that they bought off the road, the less of an over all problem they are going to see it as. which means the less resources are going to go into combating it.

				yes but because of all the sensationalist news headlines its even more important that people shut their mouths. when someone gets stopped on the street and found in possession, then get arrested and tell the cops they bought it from sr, that is then recorded in their statement. when they go to court that is brought up during the case. this is then going to be jumped on by the court journalists and it will get splashed all over the local media. reading constant local reports like that on a regular basis will turn public opinion against us. its negative press for sr which we don&#039;t need. i&#039;d say those reports are probably more negative for us with most people than the big sensationalist national news stories. the little stories bring it home and make people think its a problem that affects them in their own community. rather than something that really only happens mostly out in the bigger world.

Police and governments often target resources toward whatever the media is making a huge fuss about, lest they be perceived as not listening to public concerns. Over here that often leads to what&#039;s termed &#039;kneejerk legislation&#039; and the like. Sustained publicity could put greater pressure on governments to do &#039;something&#039; (&quot;for anything is better than nothing&quot;) and even if that proves ineffective against SR it would provide further excuses to restrict the freedoms of their citizens.

				I would just add to the above conversation that the Australian federal police are already monitoring the site, Australian customs are already monitoring the border, etc. They have people/resources assigned to this (perhaps more so than the UK from what I hear). I didn&#039;t think this was a secret. It&#039;s quite clear from the media releases these federal agencies put out that they are indeed gathering intelligence from the site.<br /><br />There is already community outrage in Australia re Silk Road, especially as there have been deaths (e.g. Preston Bridge in Perth) associated with Silk Road products. <br /><br />My opinion on publicity is a bit different - I think the horse has bolted (at least here in Australia) and the best option is to try to positively influence publicity rather than just pretend it won&#039;t happen. This is where some of my research with Adam Winstock (which he describes on the Channel 4 piece) is useful as it does not sensationalise, just describes how the trends in e-commerce are now apparent in drug markets, and how some of the drivers of online drug buying can be traced back to prohibition, and questions whether such a policy is making lives better or worse for people.

				It&#039;s still hasn&#039;t made much mass media coverage over here in Britain yet, so I think it probably better to try to keep the low profile here. Once stories start getting plastered over the front pages of the tabloids, though, that game will be up.
