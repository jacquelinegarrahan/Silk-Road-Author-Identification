				Little confused what&#039;s going on. I received a order but it was less than half the amount it should have been. <br />Whats weird is that it&#039;s not the same type of packaging as the guy usually uses, it&#039;s the packaging of another vendor i&#039;ve used.<br /><br />I was thinking maybe because it was a larger amount it would come in 2 different packages, so i&#039;ve sent a message to the vendor asking him while i keep checking the mail.<br /><br />I am also thinking the vendor could have made a mistake. Or (hope not) trying to scam. I&#039;ve bought from the guy a few times before without issue, but i did have to FE.<br /><br />Wondering if anyone else has had vendors make mistakes in the amounts? What are my options to resolve this while i&#039;m still waiting on a reply?<br /><br />Cheers.<br />

				Are you sure you didn&#039;t order something from the other person or something like that?

				Yes i&#039;m sure. I was thinking it is possible although unlikely that the other vendor made a mistake and sent something i didn&#039;t pay for. It was only a week or 2 ago i ordered from him i placed this order last week.<br /><br />The 2 vendors are from the same country so i&#039;m thinking it&#039;s possible it&#039;s the same person or they started working together and that&#039;s why the packaging is different. Everything with the package is not what the guy normally sends, not air priority, has a very unique business return address, is in a very unique case, even the writing he usually puts on the pack is not there. <br /><br />So i received a product from a vendor who i never placed a order through. Or if i&#039;m getting scammed&nbsp; &gt;:( what can i do lol

				Did you already finalize? If not then PM the vendor and ask him if it&#039;s his. If it is then tell him you didn&#039;t get what you payed for and your packaging was off, and if not then you got some free shit lol

				Ya the more i&#039;m thinking about how different the packaging is i think i got sent something i didn&#039;t order for free. I guess these vendors get backlogged and make mistakes.<br /><br />I sent a private message asking if they changed their packaging to a unique kind of case. if i get a quick response i&#039;ll know for sure.
