				Hi, everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering becoming a vendor on SR and need to get some feedback on a few things.<br /><br />Obviously I would have 0 feedback/reviews as a new vendor.&nbsp; Would you guys be willing to buy weed from a new vendor here on SR?&nbsp; I mean, obviously they all have to start at 0, but what I don&#039;t want is to pay for the account and put myself out there for relatively slim picking trying to build up feedback forever.&nbsp; While I&#039;m not exactly welling white widow here, what I have ain&#039;t too shabby.<br /><br />Feedback, please.<br /><br />Thanks, everyone.

				There are many, many new and oldies vending chronic. You would have a to fight the current of established vendors to have any lasting success.

				You are not giving enough details to get a helpful response.&nbsp; What quality of weed do you plan to sale (indoor, greenhouse, outdoor,&nbsp; mids,&nbsp; mexican brick,&nbsp; ect..),&nbsp; what weight increments do you intend to sale,&nbsp; and what kind of cost do you intend to attach to said increments?&nbsp; Where will you be shipping to and what country are you shipping from?&nbsp; This is all information that you will need to provide before anyone would be able to give you an accurate answer.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />To answer the general question that you asked,&nbsp; many new cannabis vendors surface on the road monthly,&nbsp; some do really well (see TastEtrEats and Green Oven Door for some recent ones) and some do not.&nbsp; That will really depend to the answer to the above questions and your dedication to your packaging and customer service.

				Thanks for the response, guys.&nbsp; To answer those questions, I have mids to sell and would be willing to sell in any quantities under 8 oz.&nbsp; It&#039;s all pretty clean, very few stems and no seeds.&nbsp; The prices I would have to consider but it would be in line with what I see listed on SR for comparable stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the U.S. and for now am only interested in selling domestic, at least until I&#039;m a bit more experienced with SR and it&#039;s hazards.&nbsp; I would have no option but to vacuum seal it for shipping.&nbsp; I have about 3 oz. sitting next to me right now double zip-lock bagged and it still reeks...&nbsp; &nbsp;really bad.&nbsp;

				I have thought about that as well.&nbsp; Or at least selling it really low for a while.&nbsp;

				You gotta find something to make you stand out and be special. You got midz you say? Well get the best mids, and get them cheap. You want a whole lot of decent weed and you don&#039;t want to pay too much? Go to Oneucb4u. You can be the supplier for people who want to sell to their neighborhood or dorm room but don&#039;t got a lot of cash to start out. <br /><br />Get a plan like that. It seems like ganj would be pretty tough to sell tho, what with packaging it discretely but cheaply and whatnot. Good luck bro! Dream big!
