				Seems light though for the quantities? Nowhere near the maximums, the book has not been thrown. Probably because of the cooperation of the vendor showing police how SR works, giving up his customer list etc. <br /><br />Better than a firing squad too.

If he ever did anything in his life correctly, he probably deleted names and addresses. I bet everyone outside AUS is good. Although, the customers of his who&#039;s orders were being processed/ people who ordered from him recently might be being watched. I don&#039;t want to cause paranoia but that&#039;s the truth. Stay frosty.

He may have snitched on how he operated his vending account on SR to mitigate his sentence but what would this novice have told the Police that they wouldn&#039;t have already known? There is little doubt that LE would have opened a vending account at some stage on SR to learn more about things. Some may remember how DownUnderDan&#039;s account was supposedly taken over by LE after some peculiar occurrences began to take place. This bloke wouldn&#039;t have divulged much, if any to the Police IMO. I would be more concerned with the issue of buyer&#039;s addresses being kept, even those in PGP seeing as he displayed his Private key on his vendors homepage which no doubt, the Police noted.

They don&#039;t talk openly about active investigations.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think LE will raid people who were ordering personal amounts, but they will absolutely keep those people&#039;s information. LE loves collecting intel. Anyone who ordered from shadh1 should consider the shipping locations they gave him to be unsafe.<br />

				As much as I hate the hypocritical laws about drugs, the guy was pretty stupid and was a dealer waiting to get busted.<br /><br />He might as well had saved some police time and taxpayers&#039; money and handed himself in when he placed his first order.<br /><br />Take a read of http://allthingsvice.com/2013/02/06/shadh1-penalised-for-not-propping-up-aussie-organised-crime/ [clearnet]<br /><br />I love how LE are giving themselves a big propaganda pat on the back.<br /><br />&quot;This shows that we can take people down who order drugs over the internet&quot;<br /><br />No this shows that there are stupid people out there, and you are still behind the curve when it come to technology.<br /><br />There is difference between evidence and proof.

				Lets see; he put his vendor name on his license plate of a BMW he couldn&#039;t normally afford and drove around in it, he kept on using the same phone with all kinds of incriminating texts on it(instead of a burn phone), he had all his shit at his house, he kept on getting packages from overseas even after several seizures, What didn&#039;t he do wrong?&nbsp; Then he tells the cops on top of everything,&nbsp; Thats just crazy.&nbsp; I think he was dipping into his own supply a little too much.&nbsp; With everything they got him on and 3.5 yrs?&nbsp; Naw, he didn&#039;t make any deals(yeah, right)
