				I noticed last year with TFM, and this year twice with SR, that when Daylight savings time changed the clocks, I had issues connecting with one of my machines. I know an incorrect clock will cause issues connecting to some .onions, so is it possible that DST is causing some of the issue? If I try to access through my Tor configured browser silkroadvb5piz3r.onion on one machine, I cannot ever seem to connect, but if I access it through the same Tor browser @ silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to then it is able to connect (if I understand it the .to service is exiting the Tor network, and accessing .onions through their proxy) This leads me to the conclusion that the inability to connect directly to the site without using the .to proxy is an issue with MY machine and not the SR system or server. If anyone can confirm or debunk that, I would appreciate it.

				thanks for the reply. I do however on one laptop (the only one I have that is running windows) I have to have my clock an hour ahead of actual time in order to access the site...seems strange to me, but I rarely use that machine. I was just throwing the question out there because of the odd behavior of the site lately.
