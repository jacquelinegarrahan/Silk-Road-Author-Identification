				better place to spend time than here while we wait for SR to return may be in IRC, instant chat (over TOR). Seems to be many big vendors popping in now and then too that you can ask qs so its kinda like a live-chat support for some vendors. Anyway much better with organized (and/or private) instant chat and discussion there.. too bad the topic with instructions on how to find/use isn&#039;t advertised well and not too many seem to know of and use it easily..<br /><br />here&#039;s the forumlink with more info, it&#039;s already stickied in the Off-Topic section off this forum: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175.0<br />Theres mod(s) in there, buncha vendors and other users from this forum.. 40+ from SR community in total there now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Download mIRC (or whatever client) , Try figure out and join IRC-chat meanwhile instead. Any update will prolly be posted by someone there first anyway.<br />If problems, ask in that thread (or here), and Im sure you&#039;ll figure it out eventually<br /><br />For those who don&#039;t know IRC anyway it should be learnt as you can find like hundred(s)++ of ppl on every weird narrow topic 24/7 there on all the different servers &amp; chans.. example #medicine on Freenode is usually some docs &amp; med students to ask all kinda med related qs, similar like #chemistry, #biology etc. science-related ones may be useful too and somewhat related. Other example, got a Q about Windows or a distro on linux, or perhaps just a program for linux or windows? Buying new hardware? go ask a bunch of experts on those topics willing to eagerly discuss, 24/7..&nbsp; just ask in a proper way. Try your #country or #city to chat up some locals. War somewhere or some event?-hop on irc and talk to locals on either side. Numerous big Cannabis communities out there, even for my small country theres chatrooms with tokers &amp; growers discussing all day and night. Interested in special sports or unusual things, politics,religion,philosophy, professions, .. just play around try joining chans and googling for new servers and such. Likely theres huge channels for pretty much everything of some interest, with loads of experts and other likeminded on most topics ready to discuss/answer. Wonder about TOR? on freenode #tor (i think it was?) you may find and speak to Tor devs, also buncha bitcoin chans.. And endless other topics of all kinds different places (including all kindsa crime, filesharing, pornsite logins,programming help, druggies tripping/shooting up together etc (some similar camchats etc) etc. etc...). <br />The tricky part of figuring it out is good and like a noob-filter, keeps the bad chat and grandmas from Facebook out=P Those who don&#039;t know IRC is missing out;) <br /><br />Here&#039;s a quick copy/paste line from chat, a random offer (hash, I think) ppl could save money on were they there to take advantage of it: &quot;&lt;CharasBros&gt; 1 btc per gram my best offer, valid 1 minutes only take it or leave it&quot;<br />so many reasons to get into IRC anyway. Not that much work to get into the basics, so suggest ppl who havent atleast take this time off to join Silkroad&#039;s IRC-chat and populate the chan there instead of spamming refresh here. Too few ppl on IRC still and thats unfortunate. I think many could benefit from it=)<br /><br />here check this topic- http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175.0&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />or manually browse to the &quot;Off topic&quot; section and read &quot;Silk Road chat via SILC now resides in IRC! &quot;<br /><br />cmon, more ppl get on irc-chat !?&nbsp; &nbsp;should be sticked in this SR section instead of off-topic, its not off topic!?
