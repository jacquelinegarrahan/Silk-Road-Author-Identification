				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 minutes ago<br /><br />&nbsp; Alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht escapes from jail<br /><br />&nbsp; Ross Ulbricht, the alleged founder of underground marketplace Silk Road, is a fugitative today after escaping from a jail where he was held for alleged drug law violations.<br /><br />&nbsp; Ulbricht has been charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering in connection with the website, which is believed to have collected more than $US1 billion in revenue.<br /><br />&nbsp; Harold McCarthy, acting superintentent of the jail where Ulbricht was held, said the hunt for him is now in the hands of outside law enforcement.<br /><br />&nbsp; His red prison uniform, and one of his socks, were found in a gasoline station two miles south of the prison.<br /><br />&nbsp; Ulbricht apparently scaled a 12-foot high chain link fence topped with two strands of barbed wire.<br /><br />&nbsp; Authorities would not say where they believed Ulbricht, 29, had been picked up by an accomplice with an automobile, but they did say there were no complaints of stolen clothing in the area.<br /><br />&nbsp; Watch commander David Jones said: &quot;No force had been used. He was not seen leaving.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Related StoriesBitcoin falls after Silk Road arrest 03 OCTOBER 2013, TECHNOLOGY <br />Silk Road: Did users leave traces?

				Wouldn&#039;t he be considered high risk with what he is accused of? If he can do what he really has done then surely he has means of going off the grid, especially if he has a heap of funds in accounts only he knows about.<br /><br />With that, in b4 he is shot and killed by law enforcement &#039;attempting to re-arrest&#039;.........

				The BEST part about this is Joywind really tried to make this message look &quot;real&quot;....<br /><br />And it does look real.....REAL BAD.<br /><br />The Margin is HORRIBLE And the &quot;stories&quot; below are really bad too. <br /><br />I love that Joywind put time and effort to come up with this and it turned out this bad!!&nbsp; And he actually thought he WAS FUNNY (he wasn&#039;t) and that it looked &quot;real&quot;( real bad)<br /><br />&nbsp;For someone that put effort into this, trying to make it look &quot;real&quot; and trying to make it sound &quot;good&quot; ...did a terrible job. <br /><br />Joywind you once again...... FAIL.

				It looked much like a standard cut and paste from the BBC News site to me, and the &quot;bad &#039;stories&#039;&quot; at the bottom are exactly those that were at the bottom of (clearnet http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24418847) when joywind posted :)
