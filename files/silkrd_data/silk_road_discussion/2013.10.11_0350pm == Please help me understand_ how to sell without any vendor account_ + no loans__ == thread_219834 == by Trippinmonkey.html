				Please help me understand: how to sell without any vendor account? + no loans??<br /><br />Things are financially seriously fucked up for some vendors because they relied on SR.<br /><br />People turned into junkies, like a friend of mine.

There&#039;s no scary DPR/mods to come down on you! What about BMR, or Sheep Market? - Or just make an offer on this or another forum!<br /><br />Ever since the takedown of SR, this forum has been like the Wild Wild West! - I&#039;ve done outside escrow, direct deposit to BTC addys. and more! Even paid back a BTC loan, I could&#039;ve easily stiffed, but didn&#039;t.&nbsp; <br />Shit, I&#039;ve had MORE freedom to do as I please since SR has gone. As libertarian as they wanted to be, they still had &quot;RULES&quot; so you really can&#039;t be libertarian, and have rules now can you?<br /><br />Whaddya got? Whaddya need? -&nbsp; My only advice would be to exchange PGP keys prior to disclosing sensitive information. Also have a good backup email address from a secure email account. Like Safe-Mail.net. <br /><br />Good luck. <br /><br />Weren&#039;t you a vendor on Atlantis?

				Naw I never even heard of atlantis until about 2 months ago.<br /><br />I still cant understand how sr couldget caught. I thougt they&#039;d learn from atlantis and thepiratebay for example....<br /><br />Rules here are weird. No Loans in spare coins.<br />Is a loan topic accepted? I mean, If I loan something, I pay it back. You ant know for sure, and sure I can scam you, but why would I&#039;? Iwould makern 2 people feel bad then... doesnt make sense...<br /><br />BMR doesnt allow new registrations and black sheep costs 1.7 something BTC.. and guess where my BTC&#039;s are at? Yes the FBI.<br />I already took a risk by bulk buying. This is the second time I did that and I end up no getting a huge profit, but instead a huge loss out of it. <br />That&#039;s why working on SR is best as a team, people can lessen or increase paranoia, add money, skip in etv,,,,<br /><br /><br />It would seem normal to me to continue doing business oin the forun ms then and build and escrow in here. Thatwould be perfect.<br /><br />AND KOBRIJOVE(SP?) PLS CONTACT MEEEEEEEEEE

				Partially replied here:<br /><br />I dont know anything from BMR yet besides rgetp;re full... and I want to loan 1.7 btc to sell dope to get it bacvk fast, pay back fast and steadily start vending again.<br /><br />Meanwhile I want about 5 kilo&#039;s very good uncut clean cocaine and heroine.<br />I&#039;ve noticed that you can earn money really quick with those two disgusting drugs... basecoke...<br /><br />Perhaps several vendors can ship a small amount of pure c or h so eventually I might have 1 gram.<br /><br />Then I can amaze all junkies here cuz they get more than 1%coke each hit.... or actual H.<br />Though H could be dangerous....
