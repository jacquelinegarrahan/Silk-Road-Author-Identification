				I&#039;ve only placed about 5 orders, so when a reputable vendor (top 3% with over 300 transactions) asked me to FE prior to shipping, I did because I think it&#039;s fair for buyers with little reputation.&nbsp; When he told me to FE, the order was marked in transit.&nbsp; I FE&#039;d then checked about an hour later and the order is completely gone.&nbsp; I did not receive a cancellation message.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; Money is not in escrow anymore (obviously) since I released it to the vendor.

As far as the Silk Road system is concerned you have received your order and are satisfied with it. It is now completely out of the Silk Road system.<br /><br />If you choose to FE in future, you should private message yourself the transaction details (by clicking on your name beside the shopping cart icon) so you will at least have a record of the transaction number, date / time of ordering, and amount spent.<br /><br />Again though, if there is an issue with the order, it is absolutely none of Silk Road&#039;s business as the transaction has been completed satisfactorily as attested to by you when you clicked the &#039;finalize&#039; button.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; <br /><br />I understand I&#039;m putting my faith in the vendor to be honest by FE, and I&#039;m ok with it given my lack of history.&nbsp; But is it normal for the order to completely disappear from your &quot;Orders&quot; list if you finalize early?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;m being scammed given the vendor&#039;s reputation, but I&#039;m more worried about a glitch or something. I guess I just didn&#039;t understand the order would no longer be on my list.&nbsp;

As I said, it is now gone out of the Silk Road transaction system. There is still a transaction number associated with it but it is no longer &#039;active&#039; as the system thinks you have received your order.<br /><br />Perhaps you could consider asking your vendor, if they&#039;re not too busy, would they mind forwarding you the transaction ID as you weren&#039;t aware it would be unavailable after you had finalised. At least then you&#039;ll have a record of it.<br /><br />Which vendor are you purchasing from, out of interest? Feel free to PM me if you would rather not say on the open forum.<br /><br />- grahamhgreene

				Yeah, that&#039;s what finalize means. Order is done so of course it&#039;s off your orders list.<br />If you are gonna FE at least make sure it&#039;s tracked so you know if you got scammed or intercepted. Most likely when a package doesn&#039;t show you were just scammed, but then if you don&#039;t know than waste of an address.\<br /><br />You can get your transaction ID yourself in the account history page.
