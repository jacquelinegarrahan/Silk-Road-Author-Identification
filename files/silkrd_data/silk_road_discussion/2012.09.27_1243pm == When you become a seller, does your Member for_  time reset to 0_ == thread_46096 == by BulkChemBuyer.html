				They recommend on the &#039;seller&#039;s guide&#039; that you open up a brand new account and become a vendor from that.<br /><br />This is for the vendor&#039;s safety, as other vendors would have your address etc, from your old account, if you&#039;ve bought stuff on SR.<br /><br />Hope this helps

				It&#039;s actually right there in the contract you &#039;sign&#039; when making a sellers account.<br /><br />â€¢ If you have used this account as a buyer, stop now. You want to use a fresh, clean, account. <br /><br />Link to sellers guide: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/sellers_guide

Don&#039;t tell the feds that you, as a seller, have given away your address in the past. Even if none of your previous vendors have been LE, and even if none of your previous vendors keep addresses to sell to those who inquire, either one of those is still possible, and LE may choose to pursue you as a result.Why give them reason to pick you as someone to go after?

				To answer you question, no, it will not reset. I had my account for three months before I made it a vendor&#039;s account (I did not buy anything with the account beforehand), &amp; it still said that I had been a member for those three previous months.

Regardless if you used it or not, you haven&#039;t been a vendor for that length of time. To be frank, your misrepresenting yourself and not being honest with customers who look at how long you&#039;ve been vending for when deciding who to place an order with.

				wadozo you said that Tryp &quot;didnt read what you agreed to&quot; ??<br /><br />i think you should read the agreement and sellers guide again. there is no where (unless i missed it, which is possible) that says if you opened your acct earlier that you must start a new one to become a seller. <br /><br />i agree it does not accurately show how long they have been vending, yet they are not going against the contract. all it says that if you used the account as a buyer that you should open a clean acct... <br /><br />agreement:<br />&quot;If you have used this account as a buyer, stop now. You want to use a fresh, clean, account&quot;<br /><br />sellers guide:<br />&quot;We strongly encourage you to create a separate account for making purchases. If you do not, it is possible for an adversary to find out your mailing address. If you buy something from them, and provide an address, they know that the address belongs to you and can see from your feedback how much you are selling and what you are selling. &quot;

You&#039;ve answered your own question. You wrote this at the beginning of your post<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> i think you should read the agreement and sellers guide again. there is no where (unless i missed it, which is possible) that says if you opened your acct earlier that you must start a new one to become a seller.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />only to write this further on down the page<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> agreement: &quot;If you have used this account as a buyer, stop now. You want to use a fresh, clean, account&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I realize he states that he hasn&#039;t used it to buy anything, however an unused 3 month old account, originally opened as a buyer&#039;s account, is certainly not &quot;fresh&quot; in anyone&#039;s language. The few vendor&#039;s that I queried all have a separate buyer and vending account, which without splitting hairs, is what should be happening IMO. (and it is only my opinion)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> i agree it does not accurately show how long they have been vending, yet they are not going against the contract. all it says that if you used the account as a buyer that you should open a clean acct... </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />At the very least, it&#039;s dishonest. When your opening a business, you can ill afford to be dishonest, especially on an anonymous hidden web site, where reputation is everything.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />
