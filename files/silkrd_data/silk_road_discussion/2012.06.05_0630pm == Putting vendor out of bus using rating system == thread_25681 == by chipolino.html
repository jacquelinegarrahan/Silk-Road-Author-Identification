				I have about 200 orders . User gave me 1 bad feedback and my score went down 3%. But when somebody gives me good feedback it raises by like 0.05%. WHich means I can lower vendor rating by buying small amounts and giving hime/her bad feedback. 5 bad feedbacks and vendor score down 20%. I can put anybody out of bus using this scam crap. Can somebody explain me about this unfair business practice. DPR&nbsp; if you read this please explain why it is so unfair.

				A &quot;30 day score&quot; and then an &quot;All time score&quot; seems practical like SOS does.<br /><br /><br />Just a thought, although with all the people that talk shit on me here this hasn&#039;t happened.&nbsp; Don&#039;t accept orders from people who have no sales and high return rates that usually means they&#039;re trolls.&nbsp; I tell everyone go get 5 sales under your belt then get back to me if they have more then 3 returns I don&#039;t even talk to them.&nbsp; This requires them to work if they want to be a little bitch and attempt to take me down.&nbsp; Something trolls don&#039;t like to do.<br /><br />Cheers,

				I think the rating system is weighted by purchase price. So if someone that made a 1000$ order with you leaves a 1/5 feedback it would lower your percentage by much more than if a person with a 10$ order left negative feedback.
