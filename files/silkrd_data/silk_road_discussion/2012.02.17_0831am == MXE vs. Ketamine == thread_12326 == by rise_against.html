				I think MXE has become my fave drug and could never get my hands no any K.&nbsp; I finally got someone to hook me up with a sample after basically asking everyone who sells K in the US on SR to do me a sample.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping it will be here this weekend and I&#039;ll put in my 2 cents then.&nbsp; I&#039;d love it if K is better than MXE.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to give it a shot.

				How good is MXE? I ordered half a gram and it should be here next week. I&#039;ve never done it before, never really gotten into benzos at all. I mostly just do psychs, speed, and weed. Hopefully MXE will be a fun new experience for me but I don&#039;t know what to expect.

				MXE is pretty much just the bitch version of K. <br /><br />I tried mxe for the first time recently and it was so weak. I did a fatass line and felt like I did a baby bump of k.

				MXE is was better than any Ketamine you&#039;ll get these days.&nbsp; Shame it&#039;s like that though, real Ketamine is fantastic but it&#039;s not the same anymore and if you ever stumble across a gram or two, its so expensive that you could get like 4 times the MXE for the same cash<br /><br />And MXE more stimulant than Ket too, less vegging in the corner dribbling

				K gives you a stronger sense of intoxication. It has a stronger headspace too. MXE ain&#039;t bad - just K is much better.

				Haven&#039;t tried K yet but MXE works amazing for depression.&nbsp; I have severe depression and have been hospitalized a couple times.&nbsp; MXE is not only a great trip but your depression will be lifted for about 3 days.&nbsp; You&#039;ll feel like a Million $$
