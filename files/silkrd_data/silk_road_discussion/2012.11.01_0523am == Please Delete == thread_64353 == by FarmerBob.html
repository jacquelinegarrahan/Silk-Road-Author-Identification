He had downloaded LOIC, and used it to DDOS the Church&#039;s website.&nbsp; Sometime later he was visited by the FBI, and ended up being charged with a computer crime.&nbsp; He had assumed, in his naivete,&nbsp; that this would be only a matter of a small fine, perhaps two hundred dollars or thereabouts. <br /><br />So, imagine his surprise, when he was charged with a felony!&nbsp; The prosecution painted him as some type of computer terrorist. The potential jail sentence was 5 years in jail, and $100,000 in fines.&nbsp; He was convicted, and spent a year in jail, followed by a year of supervised release. After getting out of jail, under the terms of his release, he is unable to even so much as touch a computer -- if he does so, he goes back to jail. <br /><br />You are NOT ANONYMOUS if you use LOIC -- you can be traced very easily.&nbsp; If anyone follows your advice, they potentially risk criminal prosecution, just for using LOIC.&nbsp; If someone&#039;s computer is forensically examined, and the authorities determine that they are buying drugs off of Silk Road, then the computer crime charges may only be the beginning. <br /><br />Nightcrawler <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think the computer equivalent of burglars are going to be running to the FBI for help if their sites get &quot;attacked&quot; or whatever the fuck this is. Does a drug dealer call the police when he gets robbed?<br /><br />Seriously, who the fuck are they gonna run to?<br /><br />I&#039;d still follow nightcrawler&#039;s advice, though, just to be safe.

				You would do better reporting them to Paypal and Google. Google will eventually Target the site with their browser as a scam site and Paypal hopefully would freeze their account.
