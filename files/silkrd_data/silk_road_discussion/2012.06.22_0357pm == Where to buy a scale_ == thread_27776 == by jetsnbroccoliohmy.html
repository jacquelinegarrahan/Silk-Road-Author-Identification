				Hey guys... so I had an awesome scale that I have had for years and today it wouldn&#039;t turn on, put brand new batteries in and it just isn&#039;t working :(&nbsp; I pulled out my other scale and it is only a 500g/.1g aka no good for weighing 125mg etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />So it has been years since I have bought a scale, any place you guys recommend getting a cheap one ?&nbsp; I usually buy it from a head shop / tobacco store, but was wondering if any other places say Walmart lol?&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought these old ones for like 100 a piece few years ago, not looking to spend that much again.

				You can&#039;t beat the Gemini-20 milligram scale for cheap accuracy. It&#039;s available from Amazon, just read the reviews there. It&#039;s probably available on eBay too.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340382810&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=milligram+scale<br /><br />$25 for something so accurate is just brilliant. I&#039;ve used it to safely measure doses of 2C-B which has an extremely steep dose response curve where a few milligrams too many can make a huge difference to the experience. I&#039;d say it has an accuracy of +/-3mg if used carefully which is pretty damn good for the price.

				Looks to be sold out on Amazon.&nbsp; Also I am looking to buy something more local... I am in the US.&nbsp; Something I can buy today, not take a few days to ship to me.&nbsp;

				Watch out for the ebay stuff. Bought one recently which had a rating of 0.01g and still will not weigh .1g. Yeah, it was cheap, but it doesnt work out that cheap when i need to buy another......

				Agreed. A good headshop or a pawn shop will probably have them. Just pay cash and carry.<br /><br />

I have the same scale and couldn&#039;t be happier with it. All of the scales at local headshops are twice the price, and only measure .1 grams, and the things I like to take need/must be measured in milligrams.

I just went to 5 diff head shops , all were .1g and super expensive.&nbsp; The guy at one shop was like why do you need a .001g scale I just told him forget it... going to just order online I guess and have to wait it out.&nbsp; I even went to some herbal stores to see if they carried &quot;food scales&quot; they all looked at me like I was some type of weirdo lol.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Dude, just bite the bullet and buy a Gempro 250. As .001 accurate as under $800 will get you. and at $160USD AND 30 year warranty included, why wouldn&#039;t you? You&#039;ll thank me later when you can measure literally 1mg of something easily. Get it from a reputable vendor that will replace it for you if damaged. I recommend Old Will Knott<br /><br />FYI the 250 is .001, the 500 is .002 but higher capacity. Be careful which you order<br /><br />Peace<br />JB
