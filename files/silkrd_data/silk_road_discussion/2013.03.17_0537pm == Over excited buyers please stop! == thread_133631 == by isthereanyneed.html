				This is for all the newbie&#039;s and to those who are still learning how to fly.<br /><br />Please stop getting over excited when your product arrives and leaving over exaggerated and inaccurate reviews of your product either on feedback or on here. <br /><br />I know this is easy done especially if your high at the time,&nbsp; what I would advise is leave it a few days say a week tops before leaving your reviews or feedback as usually once the initial excitement is over you will feel a lot different and if not then great go ahead with what you would have put at the start.<br /><br />There has been plenty of weed/hash over the past few months that I have bought that is nothing like the feedback, I know these days not to really trust it, usually you can pick out the ones to take note of and who knows maybe its fake feedback here also but I bet there is a fair few of you guys out there that are just getting carried away with everything and going over the top.<br /><br />You know who you are :)<br /><br />Many Thanks

				Good advice.&nbsp; I&#039;m guilty, as I&#039;ve done it a few times way back. .&nbsp; . Leaving a feedback before testing it out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually trying it out first before leaving a feedback is very important.&nbsp;

				Its easy done I suppose, its something that needs addressed right at the start of your SR journeys, as you say it its going to save people a fair bit money.<br /><br />I think the worst example of this was the feedback on No Sticks No Seeds feedback page, people saying grade AAAA+++ product, clean hash etc over a little bit commercial squidgy black or some border line soap pollen.<br /><br />I see it every where now though, it must be to do with the raise in popularity.<br /><br />I wish the feed back section had a name tag next to what buyers put but not your sr name just a nickname or guest name then at least you know who to trust and who to ignore, its no different to the forums then,&nbsp; just an idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				a sentiment I&#039;ve felt for months now, especially since the big boom in users since all the press and such. thank you for putting it out there when I apparently couldn&#039;t.<br /><br />this also goes for the veritable slew of posts expressing that you just bought/received your first package, you&#039;re sooo high on this new stuff - those kinds of inane things that should be left to your journal or a letter to your mom.<br /><br />there&#039;s an Off-Topic section if you really must, but unless you&#039;re giving us a useful, practical trip report or whatever applies to your DOC, save it. and in consideration of the OP&#039;s original point, if you&#039;re new to the drug and/or are prone to hyperbole (whether high or not), hold off a little. try it a few times, get a feel for it, step back and really make an objective assessment. that&#039;s what the vendors want and need, and it&#039;s why they sent us the samples in the first place.<br /><br />&quot;Stuff got here crazy fast and is the best I&#039;ve ever had! Sooo dank and smells great! I&#039;m so high off just a bowl right now and it&#039;s awesome.&quot; - this is crap; I didn&#039;t learn anything. you sound like a kid, and no one reading it learned anything about the transaction or the product other than how high you are, which is not actually helpful either (do your highs feel like mine? probably not, but we&#039;ll never know anyway). <br /><br />if you don&#039;t know that much about it, you shouldn&#039;t be reviewing. I know, everyone should get a shot at a free sample, but that&#039;s not the best business plan for a vendor just starting out who needs to prove their product is the best and to start making money pronto. be useful to the vendor giving you a free sample - you owe them that much, right? compose a useful review and be cool.

				So you&#039;re saying putting a 5555555/5 for reciveing a product in less than 2 days is too much?&nbsp; :P&nbsp; I am guilty of doing this as well. But it was the first order I received after placing many in my short time here. Anyways I will now remember to bring it back a bit when reviewing. On a side note I do stick by my 5555555/5 rating on product as well.

It&#039;s like almost no one that posts reviews knows what good weed is. I read a feedback, &quot;this is the best bud I have ever smoked&quot;, so I buy some quantity of it, and it&#039;s just OK. The vendors are always going to tell you that their bud is dank. I asked this one vendor how this particular bud smelled and tasted in two separate messages and he avoided answering the question twice, but he did say &quot;it&#039;s dank&quot;. I knew this meant the smell and taste was mild, even though the bud was described as dank, even when I probed about the smell and taste.

				As a seller I appreciate honest reviews, I find it kind of sad the way people are expected to review a product as AWESOME A++++++++ just because it is free.<br /><br />I try to rely on feedback to some extent as I could tell you my weed is made from rainbows and sunshine and just a single joint will send your testicles exploding with pleasure out of your eye sockets.<br /><br />My strategy around it is to be as honest as possible about the growing/processing and never EVER use words like &#039;dank&#039;. If anyone has any advice on how I can give more accurate descriptions please help, I&#039;m trying my best and I think I&#039;m doing okay but any suggestions are appreciated.<br /><br />Maybe I should go change some descriptions to me just mashing my face against the &#039;A&#039; and &#039;+&#039; keys...<br /><br />I do always appreciate good reviews though<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Great fucking post , im getting really pissed off when lookign through SR trying to find bud, and every review is amazing weeed great smoke! <br />No detailed information on dryness and curing,size and weight of buds and overall order , Smell , Taste etc. <br /><br />Im a heavy smoker though, so i suppose i would write more about it because i knew more about it, I bet a lot of people smoke the weed even if it has seeds or damp and get stoned, So they rate it 5/5. where as if me or you saw it, We wouldnt even bother smoking it. <br /><br />Just ordered a gram of DrNoName&#039;s powerplant and i reckon itl be 5/5.(very helpful seller as well)&nbsp; I will of course post an update when it arrives,&nbsp;

				Thanks for the kind words, business has been fantastic, at this rate I will be out of stock by the end of the week, but not to worry, I have a harvest in a couple of weeks so I&#039;ll be back with more of the same. In a couple of months it should be Killerskunk time and a lot of it. I can&#039;t wait for the reviews of that, they should be comical.<br /><br />Part of the joy of SR is it allows me to come and go as I need to which makes life much easier for looking after the plants and all the other work.<br /><br />SR has been very rewarding to me, even in the short time I have been here, it is a wonderful community in spite of it&#039;s foibles<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				agreed. Honest reviews are really important to my product selection. I also wonder if some of the reviews posted are by the vendor himself via a duplicate account.<br /><br />When I finalize I leave a comment on the stealth and customer service, and say I&#039;ll update when I test. Then, when I test I update the comment.

				The problem is that drugs attract both responsible adults using drugs responsibly and it also attracts kids. There was an aussie article posted recently that outlined a poll of thousands, and found a huge amount of 16/17 year olds using SR regularly. Great points being made here but I don&#039;t think you&#039;re gonna get through to that group =/

				I think part of it is human nature. It&#039;s essentially the reward system at play. The buyers drugs arrive.. and that excites them into thinking that since they have been &quot;rewarded&quot; their drugs, they should &quot;reward&quot; the seller with feedback while they&#039;re in the midst of being so ecstatic. Then they finalize and figure that even if the product is good (notice I didn&#039;t say mind blowing), they have an obligation to heap praise and 5/5 etc because &#039;it could have been worse&#039;. And maybe part of them thinks somehow the vendor will give them more/better/ next time if they kiss a little ass. <br />Also part of the issue the amount of kids on SR.

				What really makes me mad is I&#039;ll order the first time from a vendor, the stuff is really good,<br />so I go back and order again, the stuff is not that great as the first time. <br />What the hell is that about?<br />Wouldn&#039;t they want to keep you as a regular customer?<br />If I was a vendor I would want to keep my same customers coming all the time.<br />Why doesn&#039;t SR put the reviews like how they have it on ebay, for the vendor and customers?<br />
