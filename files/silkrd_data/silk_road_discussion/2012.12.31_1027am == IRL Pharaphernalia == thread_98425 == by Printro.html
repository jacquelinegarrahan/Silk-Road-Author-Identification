				So yesterday morning I had the horrific experience of a friend dropping, which resulted in smashing my gac pipe, (the pipe I have had since it was still legal to buy and sell in my state/province/ territory)<br /><br />2 days in wired and looking to continue I had a small freak out.&nbsp; How is it that I can buy my illegal goodies locally when needed, but I dont know where to buy a freakin glass pipe from!<br /><br />Deciding that I couldn&#039;t let my world end in that terrifying moment, I hopped onto the web (using the tor network) to find where I could source a new pipe now deemed illegal to sell in my neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously buying and shipping wouldn&#039;t help the predicament I had found myself in for that moment.<br /><br />And&nbsp; for obvious reasons no one gave the names of stores away, there were a couple of hints, that led to a two hour mission while wired, running through the city to find one (oh heaven).<br /><br />I did eventually find one and that has brought me happily to be able to celebrate into the new year (and not one of those BS valentines rose glasses).&nbsp; It also got me thinking - how could we start up a network for others that find themselves in the same predicament?&nbsp; Knowing LE&#039;s get on SR, how would/ could we set up a little, &#039;how to find bibs and bobs in your area network&#039;.<br /><br />Again I have no idea how to set that up without some LE reading and in turn our nice little stores getting done.&nbsp; But wouldn&#039;t it be great to know where to go when your world crumbles like mine, or where to go when your on holidays and cant take paraphernalia on the plane?<br /><br />How is that that we now live in a world where I can walk down the road and buy my party substances (granted it would be street shit, but will get me by nonetheless) and getting the paraphernalia is harder?<br /><br />I see the massive issues: <br />We cant know who is an LE and who is a trusted forum member - thus putting stores in danger<br />Giving up any city/town information is dangerous and helps remove anonymity.<br /><br />I see these issues and realise it might just be a dream, but has anyone else run into the same issues and been like, &quot;faaark what do I do now&quot;?&nbsp; <br /><br />or any ideas on making an extremely tight information centre - just for pharaphernalia?&nbsp; I guess its too risky, I see that, just curious for your thoughts

				I don&#039;t think that could be done is 100% safety... just my opinion...
