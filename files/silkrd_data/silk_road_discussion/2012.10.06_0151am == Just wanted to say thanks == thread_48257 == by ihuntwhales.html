				As the title indicates, just wanted to say thank you to all involved in the functioning of SR. You all take an enormous personal risk, and whether you are fueled by financial benefits or philosophical ideals, you&#039;ve provided us as individuals with the basic human right of the freedom to choose what we consume. It&#039;s in human nature to experiment with or partake in drug use, and the streets today are filled with impure and potentially dangerous product. After an extensive time as a buyer, I can say that all product I&#039;ve purchased on this sight has been not only high in purity, but brought fun and joy to the people around me. Most people would label the users of this sight drug dealers and drug addicts. Those people are mistaken. Regardless of the reason for your being here on this sight, you have helped improve the lives of people around the world, directly and indirectly. <br /><br />Thank you for the service, thank you for the products, and thank you for the experiences.
