				I&#039;m pretty sure Tor is far too slow to stream videos. I sometimes use **CLEARNET WARNING** http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/movies/ **CLEARNET WARNING**, but mainly I just download films using torrents. <br />1) Google uTorrent<br />2) Google Pirate Bay (or pirateproxy in the UK)<br />3) ???<br />4) PROFIT!!!

				Buy a passthepopcorn invite on SR in digital goods. PtP is a private torrent site with much better speeds, quality, and community than TPB or Demonoid ;)<br /><br />Also, demonoid.me is a good torrent site if you didn&#039;t know.

				The TPB block is no problem really, since there are quite a few proxies that will get you there, and for every one blocked, 10 more will appear.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite amusing really, a 3 year court battle and millions spent by the record companies, and the result of their win was a 10 second inconvenience for downloaders while they searched for another address to use.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />http://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/<br /><br />

Download Tixati (a torrent manager), visit thepiratebay.se through Tor, find a torrent you want to download, right click on the &quot;Get this torrent&quot; link and hit &quot;copy link location&quot;. Then go into Tixati, hit &#039;Add new&#039;, paste your magnet link into the magnet link box and voila, hello torrent! :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Here are the piratebay mirrors I use, got them all in a&nbsp; folder on my bookmarks toolbar in case any one of them is blocked. I tried using TPB via tor but magnet links didn&#039;t work soo it got annoying.<br /><br />Clearnet obviously:<br /><br />http://labaia.ws/<br />http://thepiratebay.se.nyud.net/<br />http://pirateproxy.net/<br />https://piratereverse.info/

				Movies really suck these days. Not worth even torrenting. <br /><br />Hollywood are you even trying? Fucking worthless whining greedy cunts! Even Koreans and Brazilians make better flicks, though it may be hard to find proper subs.
