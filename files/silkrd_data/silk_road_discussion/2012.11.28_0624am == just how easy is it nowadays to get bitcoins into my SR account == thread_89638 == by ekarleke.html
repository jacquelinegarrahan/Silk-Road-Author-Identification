				Regarding the process of joining an exchange, sending money to that exchange, exchanging cash for bitcoins, sending bitcoins to a&nbsp; wallet and then to SR.... I found when first doing this process months back, that i did not need a bitcoin wallet and SR served as a wallet. In other words, the process was a pain in the ass but was actually easier and involved fewer steps than people on forums were telling me. So, a few months later, today I decide to use the SR again and when I went to BitInstant to send money to MtGox, BitInstant gave me the option of sending US Currency directly to a bitcoin address. I was surprised as I would assume I still need to make the exchange from US to bitcoins. <br /><br />Finally my question, can I use BitInstant to send money/bitcoins directly to The SR bitcoin address, and expect the exchange to happen? Obviously this exchange has to happen at some point but as BitInstant is giving me the option of sending money via MoneyGram directly to a bitcoain address, it seems as though this exchange will happen automatically... has anyone done this or do they know if this will work? I would like to be rid of MtGox if possible!<br /><br />Thank so much for you input!! ???&nbsp; :-\

				I have deposited cash to bitinstant then sent directly to SR with no issue. Once you deposit the cash the bc will show up in SR account in about an hour.

				1) I am not american but people have recently reported that bitinstant requires too much personal info. This is not the best practice when you&#039;re buying drugs on the internet.<br />2) Bitcoins are hard to trace, not untraceable! Sending them from Bitinstant straight to SR might put you at risk.<br />3) If you decide to go for this option at least run your coins through bitcoinfog before sending them to SR.<br />

				Try out Blue Sky Traders... they deposit bitcoins into your account after you deposit cash into their BoA account.

				Its very easy... the easiest was is moneygram<br /><br />what you do is get a block chain wallet, (free) and then go to bitinstant (there is a 3.99% fee here for using the service) and choose moneygram send to bitcoin address, add the address from your block chain wallet to the bitcoin address field, add your email (use tormail here if possible) then proceed to use the zip zap part of checkout, here you will see zip zap charges a $3.95 fee, and choose your cash deposit place. You will be sending a moneygram to the company zip zap who then pays bitinstant who then pays mt.gox and you get a mtgox gift code. Log into your mt.gox account and transfer the money in your account (it will still be in USD format now) buy the bitcoins with your funds (under &quot;trade&quot;) on mtgox. and send those back to your block chain wallet address (you can choose for mtgox to add extra privacy by mixing in your order more for a 0.005BTC fee which isn&#039;t a lot so just do it) and then transfer the money from your block chain wallet to your SR acount...<br /><br />These transactions make it hard to trace because it is going in and out of everywhere plus block chain and mtgox mixing up your transactions. Hope this helps!

I guess i could try a small transfer and see what happens!? Cheers everyone and thanks again!<br />

But I completely agree with you and use a very similar approach, just not with Mt.Gox.&nbsp; They never check my info when I pay moneygram so I use whatever and the rest of the process keeps it random enough that I feel pretty safe about it. Hell, even if they asked for ID I would just say I forgot it, grab the paperwork and walk away.

				robitrippin...<br /><br />I agree, the process seems to be getting easier and easier everyday . My first try at this months back it took a half a days work to figure out how to do it and get it done. There were videos and forums and pages and pages of information for what now turns out to be..... go to bitinstant, go to MoneyGram go to the SR and shop! <br /><br />I&#039;m going to give it a try with a&nbsp; small amount and see what happens!
