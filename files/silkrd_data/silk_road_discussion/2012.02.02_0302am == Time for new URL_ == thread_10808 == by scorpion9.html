				Just a thought, <br />since a lot of people are having hard times logging in on to the site, would changing the url help? The new URL could be posted here on the forum. Whats your opinion?

				Has everyone who is having trouble getting on upgraded their Tor? I haden&#039;t, and I was having problems getting on. I just upgraded, and got on immediately. Just a thought.

				I&#039;m running the newest version of tor and haven&#039;t been able to get on today but I could yesterday when a lot of other people were having problems... seems to be a lottery. Also, changing the URL wouldn&#039;t help so there&#039;s no point.

				I don&#039;t think it matters, because the .onion address doesn&#039;t have anything directly to do with the site&#039;s location. It&#039;s a hashed fingerprint of a public key, which is then used to sign the information needed to find the site. If I read Tor&#039;s hidden service overview (http://&quot;https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en&quot;) correctly, that same key could be used to sign a different set of entry points if they wanted to reboot the routing to the service. (Assuming edits can be made to the distributed hash table, which I&#039;m not sure about.)<br /><br />I have no idea how hard it was for Silk and co. to come up with a key pair that somehow hashed to an address that started with &quot;silkroad.&quot; But I&#039;ll bet they&#039;re silly proud of it and wouldn&#039;t change it if they don&#039;t have to.<br />
