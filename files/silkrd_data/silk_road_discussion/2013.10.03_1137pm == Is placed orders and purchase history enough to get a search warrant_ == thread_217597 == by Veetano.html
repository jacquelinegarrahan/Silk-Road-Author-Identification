				Assuming an unencrypted address? My friend was telling me how without any physical evidence there&#039;s not much they can do in terms of charging a person. Can&#039;t really charge a person for past purchases either if there&#039;s no physical drugs anywhere to be found. How long should a worried individual lay low for?<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				conspiracy to ship narcotics over state lines, if you&#039;re in the US?&nbsp; depending where your swim is in the world it will probably vary, you&#039;re not really being informative enough.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d suggest one rule of thumb for the future: If the police want to nail anyone then they&#039;ll find something and if something they can use is handed to them on a platter, despite all the warnings, then live with the consequences of the risk taken and know which lawyer you&#039;re going to call if the time comes.

				I live in the US. The thing about conspiracy is they cannot charge a person with it unless there is a simultaneous sting. Most conspiracy charges happen when a person buys from an undercover and agrees to buy more on a later date. <br /><br />For all they know, the address on my account was a drop somebody nearby me is using. It wouldn&#039;t make much sense for them to just bust in my house and arrest me because my address was on some site. There&#039;s nothing illegal in my house anyways. <br /><br />Edit:Even if you think about it, when they have packages in hand with drugs in them with a persons name on it, they still need a CD most of the time to get a CD to somebodies house.... so if all they have is text and an address, then I imagine it would be even more difficult.

				Unless you were ordering bulk amounts I highly doubt we have anything to worry about. They have way bigger concerns right now to waste their time/resources coming after people for personal amounts, I would think. Then again you never know, they are fucking assholes. I wouldn&#039;t worry too much if you used PGP. I must say though, I will feel MUCH better when my orders arrive safely or when enough time has passed that I can assume they aren&#039;t coming.

				Yes but do you really think I would be posting this if I had ordered small amounts? On top of that my account has a very very massive purchase history in terms of $.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t use PGP either. I knew I should have. I figured, oh my vendor won&#039;t get compromised, he&#039;s a pro. I remember thinking at the time when I placed the order.... man I hope nothing happens to this site, I like my money... next day.. boom. Fuck. I definitely learned my lesson... all I can do now is hope a kill switch was indeed hit and hope everything is okay.<br /><br />At the very worse, I just pray they don&#039;t fuck up my house too badly when they&#039;re raiding it. There&#039;s nothing here anyways. I just hope they don&#039;t take anything like my computers - which i need to work. I just don&#039;t know, since there&#039;s nothing physically illegal in my vicinity for them to pin on me.

				I&#039;d say at worst you&#039;ve lost your bitcoin and you may end up on a list but only if the order was enough for someone to notice.&nbsp; with the number of messages stored and the number of transactions, it&#039;s quite possible they&#039;ll never sift through the data - particularly if your vendor wasn&#039;t very popular.&nbsp; I&#039;d just learn the lesson and move on - which is all you can do in reality.&nbsp; If it&#039;s going to bite you on the bum, there&#039;s not much you can do to stop it apart from clean house and lead an exemplary life from now on.

				I think everyone is panicking a little to hard right now, if you think about how many people have ordered products in the history of Silk Road theres gotta be hundreds of millions of orders. I don&#039;t think they are going to look into 900k+ users and their history on SR that would cost a lot of money and resources that America doesn&#039;t even have especially right now with the gov shutdown they lost some employees that do this kind of bitch work.. I could be wrong, im sure they will try to prosecute a few venders to try and send a message and scare everyone else but they lost the war.. soon we will all migrate somewhere else on the Darknet.

				I&#039;m actually hoping they do raid my house so I can stop fucking worrying and move on. I doubt they would do another raid after their first one fails to turn up anything. I really fucked up with not using PGP, which I won&#039;t make that mistake again. I&#039;m giving myself 3 months of clean living. If nothing happens then I will assume everything is at least partially okay. I have enough money to live on for some time but I don&#039;t want to reach a point where that money is totally gone.

But that&#039;s another story.<br /><br />Hypothetically, what kind of buying are we talking about? If you sent your address unencrypted, I can only assume that it was for a smallish purchase. If that&#039;s the case, I doubt they will ever come after you. As far as the statute of limitations goes, it varies by state but is usually for most crimes 7 years from the date the crime occurred (although with murder and other major crimes there is none). I&#039;m not sure because these would be federal charges. Just look it up; that information is easy to find (like in a legal reference book, or from NOLO, SPLC, or ACLU).<br /><br />And the police can charge you with just about anything for just about any reason. Ask a lawyer; the police charge people with crimes everyday that they either didn&#039;t do or that are misapplications of the law. Most of the time, if they are seriously BS/illegitimate charges, the prosecutor declines to pursue them (no guarantees). It&#039;s pretty fucking easy to get a grand jury to INDICT you though. Whether they&#039;d get a conviction or not would depend on how much they have on you, your lawyer, and whether or not they can scare you into accepting a plea.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217597.msg1587940#msg1587940">Quote from: Veetano on October 03, 2013, 11:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I live in the US.

Conspiracy just means that more than one person participated in a crime through coordinated action. If you&#039;re thinking that they have to swoop in and catch you all in the act simultaneously, you&#039;re mistaken. People get charged with conspiracy as more details about the crime are discovered. The charges don&#039;t have to be brought at the same time. They don&#039;t have to physically catch you working together. Just about everyone on this site could be charged with conspiracy.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you want to kill someone; you ask me to help, but I tell you that I could never take someone&#039;s life. You say, &quot;you don&#039;t have to kill him, just give me a ride to his house.&quot; I agree and drive you to his house, wait for you to come out, and drive you home. Well it just so happened that his neighbors got my tag number and passed it on to the police. We both end up charged with murder. That&#039;s conspiracy. By agreeing to drive you there, especially knowing what&#039;s going to happen, I&#039;ve conspired with you to commit murder, even though I didn&#039;t so much as get out of the car.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217597.msg1587940#msg1587940">Quote from: Veetano on October 03, 2013, 11:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For all they know, the address on my account was a drop somebody nearby me is using.

It&#039;s a false sense of security to be honest with you. The thing about US criminal law is, it&#039;s based on what a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would consider to be true. And when I say reasonable, I don&#039;t mean what we as SR users consider reasonable. Nobody is going to buy that shit. Why you? Are you just unlucky?&nbsp; And is your PC clean (like clean as in immune to forensic analysis, not clean as in you deleted shit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217597.msg1587940#msg1587940">Quote from: Veetano on October 03, 2013, 11:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Edit:Even if you think about it, when they have packages in hand with drugs in them with a persons name on it, they still need a CD most of the time to get a CD to somebodies house.... so if all they have is text and an address, then I imagine it would be even more difficult.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not sure what you mean here, but if you mean to get a search warrant, they just need to show probable cause (i.e. that the facts that they&#039;ve discovered during their investigation would lead a reasonable person to believe you committed a crime). That your name and address is associated with SR and that your receiving packages from SR vendors. They do NOT need to do a CD to prosecute you though. Your concept of the government&#039;s burden of proof is naive. That&#039;s just icing on the cake. They can get an arrest warrant without one (if there&#039;s enough drugs involved).<br /><br />It&#039;s very unusual for them to let a drug transaction go through without busting you before you have a chance to destroy or consume the evidence. But then again, they&#039;ve been watching this site for almost 2 years.<br /><br />If they have &quot;text and an address&quot; about you stemming from a drug transaction on SR, then they probably have more on you that that. <br /><br />Your btc transactions aren&#039;t 100% anonymous, so depending on how your getting your coins, what your doing with them after you buy them, and cautious you are are all factors.

If you don&#039;t have anything illegal in your possession (not just your house), then you can probably relax. The government has years to prosecute you though, so 3 months isn&#039;t shit. And now that I read your last sentence, maybe you should be worried. If what I think is true, how could you not have been using PGP?<br /><br />Stay safe! And don&#039;t let your guard down!

				Nope Veet, you&#039;re fine. First of all, they&#039;re not going to waste time and effort going after small buyers.

What if every time you placed an order, your vendor was dishonest and the package never came? Or even if it did come, fuck, THAT particular offense was in the past and those drugs have been consumed by now. They can&#039;t and wont touch you for that.

				Well all of the guides that I read, stated that once an order was processed it was &quot;deleted forever.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps a moderator who knows more about the inner workings could shed some light on exactly how the system worked?&nbsp; The person who said that they wouldn&#039;t waste time and effort going after buyers who have made PAST purchases, because those drugs have already been consumed: If that were true, then wouldn&#039;t their ship have sailed?&nbsp; Meaning there will never be any more active transactions to set up or catch in the act.&nbsp; They had 2 years to make all the busts they could, so is it safe to assume their main goal was to shut the site down, go after DPR, and either nail the big time VENDORS, and shut them down as well?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m curious about this &quot;image&quot; I&#039;m hearing was made of the server only up until July 23, 2013.&nbsp; Does this mean that they only have past transaction records and messages between that time frame, or can we assume that they also have from July until now as well?<br /><br />I cannot wait until more light is shed on exactly how the entire process worked, from the placing of an order until its finalization.
