				Just received this.....<br /><br />big time scam....gotta be.<br /><br />PrateRobDonationAcct &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A message to all vendors:<br /><br />As you are all well aware by now, in light of the recent DDoS attack, I&#039;ve effectively dropped the commissions on the site until midnight on the 27th (UTC). I am reaching out to all vendors right now to encourage them to join me in this victory by marking down their listing price slightly for the time being.<br /><br />In essence, this will not effect you, as a vendor, at all. Taking off my commission means that I&#039;m taking the hit on this completely on my own.<br /><br />It is for this reason, I have set up a donation account. I know most vendors have their account set up to auto-withdraw, so that is why I set up a BitCoin Address to accept donations as well as a separate account. Any vendor that wishes to donate any of their earnings during this time period is free to do so to the following Bitcoin Address:<br /><br />1NeGAnBCzTsjnVkKpvXEZMe1M1D4TbVqTK<br /><br />This is NOT a mandatory donation, and nothing will be affected if you choose not to donate. This is just an account I set up to ease the burden on myself a little bit while still keeping the customers and vendors happy. I do not want to publicly post this message for the reason that I do not want anyone to feel pressured into donating. I am just informing you of the account, and letting you make the decision whether to donate or not. Either way, thankyou for being part of this wonderful community and allowing me the honor of working with all of you.<br /><br />Your faithful servant always,<br />Dread Pirate Roberts
