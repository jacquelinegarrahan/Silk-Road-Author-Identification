				Nobody should be accessing the SR forums from windows. <br />It is hugely likley&nbsp; that the reason the feds have not taken down the forums is to gather IP data from us using an exploit. <br /><br />If you are do the following: <br />1. Download HIRENS boot CD from here<br />http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/<br />then proceed to burn the image to a CD<br /><br />2.Download TAILS or LIBERTE now<br /><br />3. Extract liberte or tails to a pen drive and test that its working. Back up essential non incriminating data to the pen drive. <br /><br />4. Boot the PC with Hirens boot cd and run activekill disk with the highest number of overwrites.<br /><br />5. Install a fresh version of windows after <br /><br />6. use only Tails or liberte to access this site.

				The thing is.. If they wanted to catch me, they would have already. I&#039;ve been online for hours. And besides, i don&#039;t sell or use any illegal drugs. I don&#039;t contribute or hide any illegal activity. My business here is to enjoy myself watching people react to this spontaneous event :/ And from where i am from, this is a human right. The police can do whatever they want. They are wasting their time on me. On someone who doesn&#039;t even live in American boarders, who is from the land of true freedom. Denmark will never let me go to jail for being free. Never

				Look this is whats going to happen.. LE does NOT have your money. Your money is in an encrypted wallet that only you know the codes for.<br /><br />LE will hold on to this for evidence against Mr. Ross, but once Mr. Ross bails, we will get it all back. The minute they reopen the site, our funds will be sent to our recovery wallets. BTC is money, and a foreign government cannot seize individual stored money on individual LEGAL bank accounts (wallets) because a stranger who we never associated with set up an illegal site.<br />I used SR&#039;s wallet to hold my money because i didn&#039;t know what else to do. I never heard of offline wallets. I never heard of wallets like electrum or those stuff. SR was easy to use so i used it, but NOT to purchase or sell! How did i know it was illegal? There was no warning signs?<br /><br />I am innocent and i will get my money back. Just wait and see.<br /><br />And lastly, if i go through the work to hide my identity, then i am a criminal for trying to hide something. I&#039;m hiding nothing..
