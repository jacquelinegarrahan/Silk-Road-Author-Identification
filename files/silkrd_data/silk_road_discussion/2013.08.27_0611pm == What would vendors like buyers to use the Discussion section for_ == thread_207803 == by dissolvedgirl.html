				Something I would like to ask the vendors is how do you feel about the discussion section &amp; what would you like your buyers to use this for? <br />For vendors I have purchased from many times or had a particularly good experience with, when I see they have 0 discussion I am inclined to write something there, even though I have already left a positive review.&nbsp; With the new changes everyone&#039;s feedback is not as readily visible so having some positive discussion (even if similar to a review) is a good thing right? I think my stats are pretty decent so hopefully me saying something positive in this section will help out vendors I really like &amp; help confused newbies to feel more confident? Or potentially warn if there is a particularly bad experience but I hope not to do that much.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear what the sellers would like this section to be used for so I can make sure I am using it properly. So far I have mostly seen it used for complaints or when buyers have been unable to get a personal message responded to by the seller. Otherwise many really great vendors have no discussion going at all. I don&#039;t think it should be used as just a negative space but I&#039;m not sure if it should be just another review section either....what do you guys think?<br />Maybe for questions you would otherwise send privately but may be beneficial for everyone to know about? I think seeing a vendor communicating positively with buyers/potential buyers is a good thing but I understand many top guys would be too busy to have something like that going on.<br />What would you guys &amp; gals like us to do?<br /><br />

				Why don&#039;t you ask DPR?&nbsp; He seems to have an idea that it is a useful tool, but currently We see little use for it like most of the rest of the useful changes of late. . .&nbsp; about the only benefit is for there to be a quicker dialog between potential buyers &amp; new vendors.<br /><br />NCK

				I use it for leaving a long detailed review since I have no idea how to use the new feedback system. :P

				Exactly what my customers are using it for http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/discussion/user/d9819292a9<br /><br />This really helps you see the true quality of a vendor.
