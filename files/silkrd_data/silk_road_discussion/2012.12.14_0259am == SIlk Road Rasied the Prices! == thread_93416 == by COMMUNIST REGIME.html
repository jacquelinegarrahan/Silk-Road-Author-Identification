				They did increase it. I think it was in the last week or two actually, but I might be wrong. That sucks man, I kinda feel bad, but I think it was to discourage scammers from making accounts.

				i&#039;m sorry, but i can&#039;t argue against them raising the prices. it will discourage someone from making a vendor account for $200 or whatever it was to make $1000 in scams. while it might harm some legitimate people, i feel like it will prevent more scammers. if you are serious about becoming a vendor, you should be able to make back your money quickly. if you plan on becoming a vendor to get ride of a set amount of product you have and then be done, you should waste the money. good luck with what ever choices you guys make in regards to this change.

				I understand the scammer side... If things go well I should be able to get a vendor account in the coming weeks (did not plan on the big price increase or it would have been today).. Hoping to be a new LSD vendor at reasonable prices as everyone else on here (USA domestic) are trying to rape people... Will start a new account for the vendor side of me when I do.. stay on the look out in the coming weeks for free samples when I get the $$ for the vendor account...

				I think the best thing to do For Silkroad would be the Accounts that were created before the update should still be the same proce and any other account that was created after the suddden price Hike should stay that way, Anyone for that Idea? because its not easy to transfer Bitcoins from Cash to Mtgox then Mtgox to Either Account or Wallet then account. this is a process of more then 7days. <br /><br />Dose anyone else agree with me?<br /><br /><br /><br />COMMUNIST REGIME.

Also, if you wanted to make like 1000 in like 2 hours, sell coke. It&#039;s retarded expensive on the road, if you undercut everyone by like 50$ a gram(easy as fuck to do), you&#039;d be rich instantly<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Will do on the pm and I cant sell coke, I like it too much :o<br />

It was changed for new vendors. Otherwise people would do like you then sell their accounts. It would destroy the purpose of the increase; ie, keeping fucknuggets like MTLJohn away, and making it harder for scammers to earn a profit.<br /><br />Understand? The fault is your own. You did not purchase your vendor account when the price was low. You also did not get a vendor account when they were just a button-click to acquire. I did. Everyone in the early market could become a vendor for just a click. Then...<br /><br />Then someone sent DPR a message. They said they would register as a seller and send dangerous chemicals, lethal powders, as free samples of cocaine. DPR realized that the risk of such a thing was too great and instituted an auction, at first. Only the one who was willing to pay the most would get a vendor account. Only one account every two days. Mitanox was the first to purchase an account and he paid... well, I don&#039;t remember. Some time later everything settled on the account-fee for $150. As the scammers have shown us, that was not high enough.

				If the purpose of the hike is just to discourage scammers, then why not offer a rebate to genuine vendors after they have a certain amount of successful transactions?<br />Or at least, accounts that were registered before the increase.<br /><br />The only people who agree with the hike are either Vendors themself, or are buyers with no intention of ever becoming a seller.

I know I said I was turned off by the price raise and will be delaying my joining as a vendor but not because I dont have 500$ for the account, its that I allocate my monies for differing things in order to remain living my rather comfortable life that I do and with the holidays right around the corner 500$ is not in the drug dealing budget at this moment until I finish pushing my current product locally... Just a thought..<br /><br />Not bashing you, just my collective opinion from what has been typed so far in this forum.. I patiently await your rebuttal..

				Why so much hate for small vendors?<br /><br />I can think of scenarios where this is bad idea, what if for example a guy wanted to sell a few g&#039;s of mescaline? There is demand for mesc and noone sells ecxtracted atm, but unless he was pushing serious quantities it wouldn&#039;t be affordable. The same thing for EU shroom vendors, their sales are too small to pay for such expensive registration, they would&#039;nt exist if it was that expensive from the beginning. Note that small doesn&#039;t mean bad, they have excellent feedback.<br />As a buyer I think we could be missing out some good deals.<br />On the other hand 500$ is still not a big deal for scammers who make thousands in a few days.

				oh, rise of the internetwarrior. But it´s a good example. Scum who cant handle more than one sentence and have a post account which shows they live on internet, can be found everywhere. But this isnt Silk Road, and it shouldnt be.<br />As i said, i will buy a account in near future. After the situation is clear. Iam just not a asshole, so i complain that little seller who do not much or no drugtrading cant access the road anymore. Whining ? Nope, i just have parents who didnt ignored me in childhood, so my social skills are not retarded.<br /><br />The pro arguments are the best ones, irony of evolution that they can sit on a chair without dropping.<br /><br />&quot;No more Scammer&quot; - Professionell scammer buid up reputation with bigger amounts, and then scam. 380€ more vendor cost wont stop them.<br />&quot;SR is only for big fishes&quot; - Oh, getting old ? Bigmouth for the poor, forget they wasnt born as nobody like everyone else, and now think hes someone better. Ok, only untill they are excluded, then they claim to be discriminated.<br /><br />&quot;Gangster No.1&quot;... Have a pack of coloured papers and think he is special. Yeah sure, like Paris Hilton...<br />Just flame on, it dont impress me, i know you need it to push your low self-esteem.<br /><br />But the best part on the whole story is the situation around it. DPR is unseen, every mod is silenced, the seller price is rising, bitcoins disappearing from accounts... Well, if this really blow up i would like to see the faces of those &quot;big fishes&quot; here how they loose all there money and getting busted, haha, what a bunch of poor idiots.

				<br />It&#039;s basically down to this. People are bitching about the fee being raised and can&#039;t understand why it&#039;s so high. It&#039;s not about little vendors don&#039;t belong. I respect every vendor who comes here and does their job, big or small. What it&#039;s about is the fact that if you can&#039;t cover $500 at this point in your career than SR is not the kind of place you need to be, not right now. $500 in sales is shit in this line of work, and the services provided for that one time payment are easily worth it.&nbsp; You act like the fee is a cash grab, like SR doesn&#039;t do shit after that. I mean you could easily go set up your own shit.&nbsp; Secure, complete with escrow and hedging and storefronts and throngs of people to buy your product. But fuck man, that $500 is bull shit! It&#039;s not like vendors benefit from it. I&#039;ve never heard of a dealer getting robbed or killed IRL. Or maybe you could make a sign with product/prices and put it on the corner with a big arrow pointing&nbsp; to you so everyone who passes by can see. <br /><br />Every service has a fee, don&#039;t you charge a fee yourself for your goods? While this service is kind of unknown. No real alternatives to compare prices with. You can talk all that shit about other sites but bottom line, you&#039;re here so they aren&#039;t really alternatives, are they?&nbsp; If you can&#039;t raise the $500 than you really need to take a look at your whole operation and why. You can be small and successful here, but even that is larger than $500 worth.&nbsp;

				Coming from a person who plans on vending on the silk road in the near future...the $500 dollar fee isnt shit when you think about how much more you can sell product here compared to on the streets...with alot less risk involved.&nbsp; Like for instance...if you sell bud in California you know that the most you&#039;re going to get for a pound right now of good indoor is like 2500 a pack.&nbsp; People on here are selling green house for 900 a qp.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t make money from silkroad...you should stop doing whatever you are doing...and go work at fucking mcdonalds.

				I don&#039;t consider myself a big vendor by any stretch of the imagination, but seriously $500 is a small amount to pay for the opportunity that is being offered to you.<br /><br />As has been said, if you cant afford that fee then you are not serious about being a vendor. Getting BTC into cold hard cash can be as tricky as obtaining it when you want to do it anonymously, if you have any sort of cost in obtaining your product then you will need to do this on a regular basis in order to re-stock. If you cant handle $500 then you will not be able to deal with the delay between selling and shipping the product and actually getting the profits in cash.

				If I were you, I would buy it!<br /><br />As for me, I wish I could have gotten in on the $150 but I tell you what $500 does for would be vendors: if you are smart, it makes you double check and reflect that you are PREPARED for being a vendor.<br /><br />Money is the driving factor, and lots of it. Next is actually doing it in a medium that is safe. When you get into listing, packaging, scamming, and most importantly converting bitcoins to cash, it&#039;s a BUSINESS, a sweet one, but still a business.<br /><br />I look forward to weighing my options for 2013. The price will not be the determining factor, but will the headache of vending be outweighed by the &quot;pocket ache&quot; of my current lifestyle.

				Sweet. 500$ for a seller account. Now prices ofgoods are going to get even higher. Smells like greed to me. I guess someone wanting to scam 3000$ wont pay the 500 huh? Hell if uou jack the prices up to 1000 theres nooooo waaay some asshole will pay it to scam 10000. Maybe vendors would pay that price if things were a bit more reliable. Takes some nerve to more than double the fee after the recent events on SR

				This is from the seller guide- is it out of date or is the 500 refundable?<br /><br />Bond<br />You are required to pay a bond when opening a seller&#039;s account that will be refunded to you after you have demonstrated that you are an asset to the Silk Road vendor community. To be eligible for a refund, you must have completed at least 30 transactions totaling $1,500 or more and have been a vendor for at least 6 weeks. To request a refund, send a message to vendor support after you have met these conditions. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee you will be granted a refund. All requests will be reviewed manually.

				I could see how the $500 could repel people away from becoming a vendor. It&#039;s difficult to determine the market conditions (ex:volume of buyers) of some products on SR, so it creates risk of the capital you invested. You could be a brilliant chemist but really have no IRL drug connections, invest say $2,000 to make a small 250g batch of amphetamine to test the waters, spend $300 on packaging material + the $500 SR fee, you&#039;re already $2,800 in the hole. That&#039;s a cost of $11.20/g, You&#039;d probably have to sell it at $15/g or lower to get feedback and if after all that you&#039;re only getting 1-5 order per day, it&#039;s really not worth being a vendor.

				Here is another way of thinking about it:<br /><br />SR is making you take a bet when you sign up to be a vendor. The bet is $500USD that you aren&#039;t a scammer. You get a free vendor account if you prove to be a legit vendor. SR gets your $500 if you are a scammer.<br /><br />Sounds like a great deal for legit vendors.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93416.msg722255#msg722255">Quote from: jackass2.0 on January 12, 2013, 07:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s interesting how much of a closed dictatorship SR is.

				I can&#039;t believe that there&#039;s six pages of whining about a measly $500. This is a private community, so if you don&#039;t own it, you don&#039;t have the right to dictate how it&#039;s ran. The man behind the curtain has to answer to everyone who comes here, if he wants us to continue to come here. Therefore, he must address scamming however he can. So, I believe that it is in everyone&#039;s best interest that a vendor account costs more than most schmucks makes in a week (including me). So, even though this also fucks me, who had the original fee, and my cop money all put away. Now I&#039;m flipping some of the money originally intended to get me started on here so that I can make up the difference.<br /><br />Imagine that, taking some of the responsibility on yourself for not having a few bucks in the bank. And, having the presence of mind to be able to look at what DPR did, leave my personal feelings out of it, and see that it makes the community safer for us in the future. He didn&#039;t do this to fuck you , or me. He did it as an offensive action against scammers. Faggoty bitches whining like your mom took your sucker.

I&#039;ve never heard you say one positive thing you just sit around bragging about your drug cock, which, is a shriveled little meph cock anyway. If you think you&#039;re so fucking hard get some coke or SOMETHING even, mdma for christ sakes instead of peddling all this legal high garbage that was just made to mimic the REAL drugs anyway. You&#039;re a european mtljohn. Oh wait at least he sold real drugs<br /><br />Edit: Sorry for the negativity to all the people that don&#039;t deserve it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol kid my shit ain&#039;t garbage, far from it, also the margins are much better than blow and mandy so do the math. ;)<br /><br />What do you do with your life boy? You sit at a desk wishing your life away? I got everything I wish for, I can do anything I like. I&#039;m sure as shit you don&#039;t. :)<br /><br />Kiss, kiss kid. Kiss, kiss.

If you shit a brick over half a G then Christ only knows what the stock size is. <br /><br />Ya need to get real. Whether you want to admit it or not you have to commercialized to keep up on SR so if you can&#039;t why throw ya cash down the shitter. Pointless.

The bet is $500USD that you aren&#039;t a scammer. You get a free vendor account if you prove to be a legit vendor. SR gets your $500 if you are a scammer.<br /><br />Sounds like a great deal for legit vendors. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Interesting view, it *sounds* good indeed, until you start thinking it through fully.<br /><br />This measure is supposed to be stopping scammers, but it&#039;s very selective at doing so. It might only work for the scammers who never plan on selling anything, in a short period of time. Scammers like Noriega come to mind or at least this type of scam (iirc), for those who don&#039;t know: huge marketing - let everyone FE - run off. It would not stop the scammers that just go rogue at one point, like most recently Tony76 or MrFireUk. They would win your bet with flying colors. <br /><br />So it only affects the smaller scammers and vendors anyway. Let&#039;s go through this as well. Say a scammer has $600 to get started. He buys his acc, uses buyer accounts for fake transactions, manages to fill all criteria easily. Now he can scam the heck away and on top of that even scams SR for the $500 refund. <br /><br />A legit vendor with $600 needs to buy product as well, so for those guys it&#039;s now pretty much impossible to get started. This new measure takes away the starting ground from smaller vendors, while at the same time still granting it to scammers. <br /><br />If you have $600, it&#039;s now easier to scam people than to start legit vending. Think about that for a minute please and let it sink in.<br /><br />I still haven&#039;t seen one explanation (besides the plump attempt of stopping growth) that cannot easily be out-argued and turned against itself. I&#039;m all for stopping scammers, but please put more thought in the measures that are put in place. Tony76 wouldn&#039;t only have scammed hundreds of buyers, but SR as well. How&#039;s that good news for anyone? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93416.msg722255#msg722255">Quote from: jackass2.0 on January 12, 2013, 07:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">It&#039;s interesting how much of a closed dictatorship SR is.

Just paints a big target on you. Also personally I feel it should be high priced because to really benefit from SR you need to be able to put weight on the table, otherwise you just wont be able to keep up with the demand in particular, if your product is of a high quality. If anything, I think people that become vendors need to take a step back and really consider what they are getting into. More than one vendor has come to myself and other vendors simply asking how to cash out after they ran out of stock first time round let alone properly. Given the size and traffic that SR gets and the amount of product it turns over it&#039;s just unrealistic for a low baller because I would guess that realistically it would cost someone $2500 to comfortably set up on SR including stock and all the necessaries and that&#039;s not really low balling, that&#039;s a commitment. Sorry if that makes you feel all shivery and sad TK1991 but once SR&#039;s popularity and thus product demand increased did you really think it&#039;d still be able to remain all cum-bi-yah? It&#039;s like when people moan about supermarket chains killing the local butchers shops. People want shit, whenever they want it and low-ballers just can&#039;t cater for that. Just the harsh world of economics and hence the need for corporations. <br /><br />Also what made me laugh is that someone once said they balanced vending with a 9-5 job. If you have a popular product you can forget that shit straight away, I wouldn&#039;t even moan if the price for an account was a full grand given what you can make back here and the resources you can get at. <br /><br />So in summary TK no, I wasn&#039;t born with a brick of Meph in my hand but I did come prepared and I wasn&#039;t spoon-fed fuck all, and my drugs are excellent. You may have a sample if you wish. :) Time to see the change before your eyes though.

Give him credit to become a vendor (new account) is what I said. Some people don&#039;t want to really &quot;benefit&quot; in the way you do. Please stop assuming your way is the only/right way. <br /><br />It&#039;s not unrealistic for a &quot;low-baller&quot;, I buy all of my gear from such vendors. They buy a certain amount of stock, they know they can handle and sell it off. They are probably very happy with the extra bucks they make, while staying under everyone&#039;s radar. Why would you deny them their existence on SR? <br /><br />The traffic and size of SR is completely irrelevant, or why are there domestic only vendors? And stealth listings? You don&#039;t have to fill all demand. If a vendor grows 100g of weed and sells it off, then he just doesn&#039;t have any more. Stops selling until new crop. You don&#039;t need to have unlimited supply to sell something. Often it&#039;s scarcity that makes a product attractive.&nbsp; <br /><br />No disrespect to you, but you are the type of vendor I came to avoid. Either extremely overpriced or mediocre quality. Personally I have no use for you (I actually had to look you up, yep overpriced RCs it is). Do you actually have a point in there somewhere? Besides you are the best? Try to put yourself in someone else&#039;s shoes. A weed grower who has too much weed and wants to cover his costs. Why shouldn&#039;t he sell here? Why is he less important than you? The weed is harder to get than the RCs you sell. I&#039;d kick any RC vendor out in a heartbeat for some skilled weed grower.

				So Lim you&#039;re saying that basically you&#039;re Wal-mart and all the other niche driven vendors are butchers, tailors, etc?<br /><br />You&#039;re the greedy corporation and the other &quot;type&quot; of vendors are honest people specializing in what they do best, in order to provide the best quality possible?<br /><br />That attitude is fucking the entire world and you want to embrace it? Priceless. I wish I could screen cap that. It&#039;s alright though only the lobotomized end up at walmart anyway so you can have all the retarded buyers on SR, keep them away from the quality vendors (I don&#039;t know when 91 became a good vendor rating...)<br /><br />And as for your offer?

That&#039;s a cost of $11.20/g, You&#039;d probably have to sell it at $15/g or lower to get feedback and if after all that you&#039;re only getting 1-5 order per day, it&#039;s really not worth being a vendor.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You believe it costs $2,000 to make 250g of speed???

Forget about it.<br /><br />What was his plan anyway? Cook a single batch and get rich off it? If the only way someone can afford to sell drugs is with zero overhead and a freely provided secure anonymous communication line to thousands of potential buyers. . . if a 1-time $500 along with having to buy shipping envelopes is enough to discourage him ... I&#039;d say the fee did the job well by scaring him off. He&#039;d probably curl up in a ball and die in the real world where new businesses (legal ones) usually take 2 or 3 years to get out of the red and start turning a profit.<br /><br />Why try to entice a guy like that to become a vendor when he&#039;s got no experience moving drugs and wouldn&#039;t be able to handle the pressure if he actually did start doing regular business? It&#039;s selling drugs, not running a lemonade stand.<br /><br />And just think not only of the scammers, but all the LAW ENFORCEMENT that would set up shop as vendors and start shooting fish in a barrel.

Let&#039;s make the 250 transactions worth $100 on average. Let our fictitious vendor now scam people and get banned. Leaves him with $25000, so where do you draw the line on account pricing? Make it $25001?<br /><br />There obviously is a need for a more complex setup of fees, taking sales value, amounts and practices (FE) into account and charge based on that. Or make vendor accounts available via a trust-based system, as mentioned. <br /><br />We won&#039;t see either, SR staff doesn&#039;t give a fuck (about this particular issue). See you all in SR 2.0 :-X

Indeed. But it&#039;s not that simple (not the decent feedback system - that actually is). I&#039;ve been on here for a while, seen all kinds of scams. It needs a bit more dedication than just throw in amazon&#039;s or imdb&#039;s rating algo. <br /><br />The complete lack of interest in this (like so many other) issues by SR staff keeps amazing me. Since they are all full-time criminals, as Limetless pointed out, you&#039;d think they be more visibly active. (yea, I know they could be working on SR3.0 already for all I know)

				From a buyers perspective, I don&#039;t mind that the price has gone up. It keeps scammers away.<br /><br />The biggest problem as I see it, is that it might open up a market for selling old vendor accounts. A potential scammers heaven.
