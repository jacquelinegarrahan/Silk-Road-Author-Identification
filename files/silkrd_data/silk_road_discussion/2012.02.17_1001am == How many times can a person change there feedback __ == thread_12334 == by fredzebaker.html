				Psycho AND misinformed, I think.&nbsp; It will likely taste sweet if it was designed to be taken sublingually, and only then if such a trait was engineered into the pill.&nbsp; Not all are supposed to be taken under the tongue, although all CAN be used in this manner.&nbsp; &quot;Sweetness&quot; is not a characteristic of the active ingredient, but in the binder it is contained within.&nbsp; Clonazepam tastes (to me) like any other benzo...&nbsp; Somewhere between Alprazolam and Diazepam on in terms of nastiness...<br /><br />He probably likes his rolls all &quot;smacked out with heroin&quot;, too.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Did he order powder?&nbsp; It would explain why he didn&#039;t think he got what he thought he was getting if he&#039;s used to the taste of sublingual pills, but not his psycho 60 messages.

				Its my understanding that the active ingredient in certain drugs like valium and clonazepam cause a sweet flavor because they mimic on the tongue a reaction similar to orher things like sugar...or whatever. Theres a name for this i cant recall at the moment but i think ill go look for it now. this is interesting.<br /><br />I found what I was looking for:<br />I quote...&quot; In 1 acronym? TRBMB ( transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member B ). The amide function of the benzodiazepine binds to the receptor &amp; the 2-chloro activates same. &quot;<br /><br />Again quoting:<br />&quot;In english,I just mean the body can taste &#039; coolness &#039; which is why minty things taste minty. Clonazepam just happens to have a chemical structure that will be sensed as such.&quot;&nbsp; &quot; BTW a decade or so ago I obtained a few grams of clonazepam powder. In pure form it&#039;s minty but in bulk it gets more bitter.&quot;<br /><br />Basically I think an argument for clonazepams sweetness can be made here. When it come to taking pills, especially regularly, the taste can very well be an indicator to the contents of a pill. I know from personal experience that clonazepam tastes sweet.....and xanax is quite bitter. I saw a person had obtained sweet tasting xanax and I knew this could not be real xanax.<br /><br />That&#039;s all folks....and thanks for welcoming me to the forums...and of course Silkroad. I know I&#039;ll have some fun here.

				I can&#039;t answer your question.<br /><br />I can tell you that I&#039;ve had Clonazepam prescribed to me about 5 times through the last 7 years. I&#039;ve received a total of 4 different brands/generics. One of them tasted/worked very well sublingually which is the best way to &quot;abuse&quot; clones. One brand actually burned a little bit. Keep in mind these are all from the pharmacy. I&#039;ve tried 0.5mg, 1mg and 2mg pills all from 4 different makers. None of them tasted sweet to me personally.<br /><br />Some people have recessive taste alleles. The gene TAS2R38 has 7 different forms and can affect how people taste things. There is a test for this a lot of professors use in high school and college chemistry classes as a demonstration of dominant and recessive gene traits.<br /><br />What I&#039;m getting at is that people taste things differently. Because Cloneazepam comes in so many different variations with different fillers and binders it&#039;s possible the one Fred sent is just different from what you&#039;re used to. <br /><br />Also, people build a tolerance to Clones VERY quickly. Sometimes in a matter of 3-4 weeks. I used to get a bottle of 90 0.5mg clones and I&#039;d &quot;drink&quot; the entire bottle in one go and feel virtually nothing. My buddy could take 2 and be out on his ass. It&#039;s possible you&#039;re causing a rukus here because you&#039;ve built a benzo tolerance (there is a cross-tolerance as I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware) and aren&#039;t getting the same effects you used to get.<br /><br />Either way nobody is going to rip you off with benzos dude. If he was in the business of ripping people off he&#039;d probably go with ANYTHING else. Benzos where I&#039;m from are practically free. You could goto a walk-in clinic and get a prescription and have it filled cheaper than getting it on SR probably.

				My name&#039;s Paul, and this shit&#039;s between ya&#039; all.....to quote a movie. Not taking any sides here.<br /><br />Generally though...taste.....is hardly a good indicator for pharmaceutical drugs.....just thought I&#039;d throw that in....

				- i dont think you can put a limit on it, as a transaction could take weeks to be finalised and a lot could change during that time; seller could send out more product<br />&nbsp; then we&#039;re back to square one the process almost starts all over again -pack, post, postal delay, pickup, review product, post new feedback...and if a limit is implemented<br />&nbsp; its possible the last change to feedback becomes locked and cannot be rectified then what ?!<br /><br />?!<br />&nbsp;???
