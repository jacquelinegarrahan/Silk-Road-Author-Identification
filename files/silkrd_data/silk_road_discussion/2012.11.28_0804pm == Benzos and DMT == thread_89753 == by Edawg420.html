				So the other night i was coming down from my acid trip and i thought it would be a good idea to pop a 2mg Xanax<br /><br />Well this did nothing for my ability to sleep but only make me completely mellowed out, like doing the &quot;totally cool man&quot; and other typical drugged out phrases, straight up hippie to the max if i ever saw one. (Not that that is a bad thing)<br /><br />So somehow in my bad thinking (or awesome thinking) me and a buddy thought it be a wild ride to smoke some DMT.&nbsp; Now i am deathly afraid of DMT sober.&nbsp; IDK why, i have ALWAYS had an amazing experience, its just so hard for&nbsp; me to let go of my consciousness.&nbsp; Even with LSD it is hard for me to just let go and enjoy the trip, until that anxiety phase is over or foucrse, but even then its hard for me to let god and flow with the trip.<br /><br />Anyways i pack him up a bowl and i decide that i would finish it off.&nbsp; BOOM amazing images but slightly distorted, and not the clearest or most intense.&nbsp; So here is my proposed question:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Did i just fuck up the DMT ride, and i should not wasted time and vaporized it through the volcano as it never wastes any DMT, and take that bad boy all to the dome?<br /><br />2. Do benzo&#039;s dull psychedelic images or visions.&nbsp; Now, i do remember having some like fuzzy CEV but like i said felt very diminished and sub breakthroughish.... if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Anyways...I really hope they don&#039;t kill the trip, cuz man i could do psychedelics all day feeling all Xanaxed up =P<br /><br />peace and love

				I too am deathly afraid of DMT for no real reason. I&#039;ve found that a great way to eliminate any anxiety about it is to do a line of ketamine and wait 15-20 minutes first. This combination is one of the biggest mindfucks you will ever experience.

				Well, next time i am gonna dose up 2mg of Xanax.&nbsp; When i feel the fuck it, i don&#039;t give one fuck attitude, imma volvano a 100mg of DMT....none of this take the 3rd n 4rth rip outta a pipe as its being passed around.<br /><br />I personally didn&#039;t think they would dull any effect because benzo&#039;s are just a sedative / anti anxiety.&nbsp; People only keep those bitches around for sleeping after hard nights of parting.&nbsp; In long term treatment benzo&#039;s are for anti anxiety. Hmm well i certainly hope it doesn&#039;t dull the experience, as it is my last .1 of KicCasio&#039;s DMT.<br /><br />Does anybody have any other experiences?&nbsp; Doing a line of Ket is not gonna happen for me as it&#039;s not widely available around here and IDK if i am ready to venture into what i have heard to be a &quot;K-Hole&quot; =P<br /><br />peace and love

				@ Eris<br /><br />its true brotha....i have always come back with amazing experiences but again i have always come back with more wonder and confusion also...my furthest breakthrough was so far so unreal it really kinda scared the shit outta me... not in a bad way, just that i died from this world, lived as a being of light in another world, died and then came back to this world.... after that...well i think i literally felt crazy.... hahah...still love the shit but i am so fucking scared to have a bad experience... because of how ridiculously powerless i was in that other world.... if anything went wrong....well i could seriously imagine some sort of PTSD
