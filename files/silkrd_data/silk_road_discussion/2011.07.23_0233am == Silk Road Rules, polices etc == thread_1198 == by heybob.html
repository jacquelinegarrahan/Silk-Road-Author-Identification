				I am very sorry if this is already readily available. I searched and found very little and am a victim of account theft and feel I can prove it.<br /><br />Bottom line is this... without going into details, I have a specific user handle and with a certain amount of &quot;status&quot; I guess you can say that is associated with it.&nbsp; Many people know that my ID, username, account id, whatever you want to call it... is known for honest and fair sales of hard to get items.<br /><br />On a specified date and time (that I was able to provide to management) I created an account on Silk Road with this name. I loved it browsing all the cool stuff. I never bought anything because I hadn&#039;t totally figured out Bitcoin yet. I did create an account on MtGox which I successfully recovered today. Anyway, my account was one of the many &quot;compromised&quot; and closed as a result of the hack that all the user accounts was stolen. This made me nervous so I didn&#039;t come back to Silk Road for a while... till today. When I couldn&#039;t login, I thought maybe I forgot my password but a friend congratulated me of my sales on Silk Road! I&#039;m thinking what? I searched ALL OVER THE PLACE for password recovery and the best I could find was to create a temp account and contact management. I did and they answered fast asking for details about my account which I feel I provided. But I haven&#039;t heard back. <br /><br />Thing is, this person has been selling under my well known user name and doing good so I think they may not be thrilled with the idea of closing him down.<br /><br />Bottom line... I&#039;m trying to find specific rules or policies regarding something like this. I want my good name back if this is possible.<br /><br />Are there specific rules that would cover a situation like this?<br /><br />Assuming I am telling the truth (I understand it&#039;s yet to be proven but I feel I can) and someone hijacks another user&#039;s account, then proceeds to conduct honest business (for the time being) how would something like this be handled? <br /><br />My concerns are<br />this IS MY ACCOUNT and it was TAKEN FROM ME<br />and<br />if he starts to fail, again it&#039;s my name everywhere else and will likely effect me negatively&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I want to take every possible step allowed by policy to recover my account. I don&#039;t want his feedback or money... just my name<br /><br />Please, if anyone knows what I can do about this or can share rules or polices that can help a person recover a user name that was taken without consent, I would GREATLY appreciate it <br />

				Would your good name happen to be one of the ones that have been called a scammer, like say Barrysneaky or the other chick?<br /><br />If so this explains everything.&nbsp; I was just about to call off dealing with him but now that it looks like he really is good and someone else got his account I might just spend the last 20 or 30 bitcoins I have, lol.

				If you have been around this scene for that long, then there are people on this board who you likely shared some level of personal detail with who could identify you.&nbsp; By just what you have posted you could be sincere, the thief not the account owner, just a troll or anything else.<br /><br />As SR clearly states in its buyer and sellers guide, this whole operation (the site and the programming) are still in an experimental phase.&nbsp; SR is doing everything he can to keep the service up and running efficiently.&nbsp; If you spend any time on the BTC forums, you know the asinine level of attacks being made on SR, Mt. Gox, and virtually all of the pooled mining entities servers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on drug forums online, both as a buyer and seller, since 1996.&nbsp; If you like, you could send some (non-vital) details of who you are and what your &quot;brand&quot; name is and, I could ask around to find something out for you about getting the account back.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think SR has a standardized and fully codified set of guidelines for this situation.&nbsp; Some things just have to be handled as they occur.&nbsp; But I could be wrong.<br /><br />What you need to do is tell someone, myself, or find another person on here that you believe you know from prior forums and see if, to start, your identity can be verified as belonging to the account in question.&nbsp; Because it seems, IMHO, that shy of proving that, you&#039;re probably not going to get very far.&nbsp; Free advice; worth what it costs. <br /><br />Lastly, how long have you given SR admin to respond?&nbsp; He is extremely busy these days.&nbsp; Maybe he is looking into it and he just hasn&#039;t gotten back to you yet.<br /><br />If worse comes to worse, you can always do what they do in the Twitter universe when someone jacks their name: instead of being &quot;heybob&quot; you can open a new account as &quot;therealheybob&quot; or &quot;originalheybob&quot;.<br /><br />BTW, my name online all those years was not &quot;joeblow2&quot;.&nbsp; So you wouldn&#039;t know me from that.&nbsp; But you probably would if I told you my old sellers name, so I really can probably assist you, at least partway, if you give me that one detail.&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp; :D

				Another reason why all vendors need to post their PGP key. Im sure SR backs up their database once in while and if they had to, thy could go back to the date that&nbsp; you opened the account and look at it. If your PGP key was there, then you would have&nbsp; a lot of evidence on your side.

THE VERY STUPID thing I did was have the same PW on MtGox as on SR<br /><br />I would like to think regardless of the &quot;questionable&quot; items for sale, HONEST sellers are still desired and needed. If a seller starts his career on SR by stealing my user id, this is NOT what I would consider reasonable proof that he is not as honorable as he appears. I did successfully recover MtGox account since they closed all account right after the attack so even tho he had my username and pw, he couldn&#039;t get in because it still had my email which I&#039;m sure he tried to get into but was unsuccessful. However on SR there is no real recovery process that I can find. I was able to tell them EXACT TIME and DATE and EXACT status of the account&nbsp; at the time. I also told them what the pw was before the hijack and that it was changed before he started selling the same thing I sell elsewhere on popular pharm sites with the same user id. I still, as of today, not heard back after I was able to give this level of accurate details. Will they let him keep my account since he is delivering and making customers happy? I hope not

				First off I would like to apologize to the original heybob. I am truly sorry for the hassel and headache i put you threw. I had no intentions to cause you any kind of trouble.&nbsp; So here&#039;s what happened...<br /><br />So after discovering sr i knew there was a good opportunity for myself to help people. I wanted to share what i love so much. <br /><br />So after finding out how much the auction was for an account I did what I do best, try and find it cheaper. I started searching around to see if anyone was selling their accounts. I found an anonymous person on bitbetter.org who said he was selling his seller account for 5 btc. I thought it was a good deal so I quickly jumped on it. I did not hack any accounts, I didn&#039;t brute any passwords I just bought it from the wrong person. <br /><br />I take full responsibility and blame for my actions and want to do anything possible to make up for heybob&#039;s troubles and anyone else this effected. I did however live Heybobs name to the best and fullest way possible. I didn&#039;t banish it anyway and I have about 40 customers that will vouch for that. They will all say that heybob lived up to its name and reputation. <br /><br />SR contacted me and I about melted in my chair. I said rite away what had happened and that I felt horrible about it. So the awesome people at sr said since i was doing so well on their site that they would switch my username and give the name back to the original owner. <br /><br />I am truly sorry for what happened and i&#039;m so glad heybob got his account back.&nbsp; <br />

				It seems like the one bad apple tried to spoil the bunch, but it seems that LexieSadie is truly on the up and up. It&#039;s good to hear that everything has seemingly worked out.

				I had a pretty strong feeling that this was what had happened.&nbsp; *Somebody* was planning on trading on HeyBob&#039;s good name but when they didn&#039;t, they victimized someone else when they sold it.<br /><br />But now, SR ends up with TWO good sellers...instead of just one.<br /><br />I love stories with happy endings. :)

				I&#039;m kind of confused again (imagine that). I&#039;ve heard all this talk about BarrySneaky being this dude who came, got good feedback with a few transactions and then started direct-paying offline and scamming people.<br /><br />So, um, why is he STILL listed as a seller with items for sale??????
