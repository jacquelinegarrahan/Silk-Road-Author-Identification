				Had posted this in Technical...but I don&#039;t think many look there...&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I have made 5 deposits to my SR wallet over the last couple days, and I am not getting a new bitcoin address generated after each transaction as we are supposed to... With no manual button like there used to be, I am at a loss as to what is going on... Notified SR and he said that this was supposed to have been fixed a couple days ago?? Which it seems is not the case...<br /><br />Is this happening to anyone else?<br /><br />

				Happened to me as well. I think you have to log out and log back in to get a new one. Thats my theory anyways.

				I tried logging out and logging back in multiple times no luck generating a new bitcoin address... Also tried withdrawing a small amount thinking that might generate a new one, but when you click the withdraw button it loads to a blank page with no record of the withdrawl?!?!?<br /><br />SR can you please let us know what is going on with this issue... Thank you!!<br /><br />

				Same, withdrawal isn&#039;t working. I think SR&#039;s bitcoind might have crashed.

				sounds like a bitcoind crash for sure.&nbsp; SR will reboot it and you should be good shortly - just fire a PM off to SR or a mod and they will let admin know to reset bitcoind.<br /><br />this was happening about 10 days ago, with all transactions though.

				SR - <br /><br />Can you please look into this again...the issue with withdrawing seems to have been fixed...but the original problem that I brought to your attention a couple days ago about Bitcoin Addresses not generating after each transaction is still DEFINITELY an open issue.<br /><br />I made another test deposit this morning and a new address was not generated<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />
