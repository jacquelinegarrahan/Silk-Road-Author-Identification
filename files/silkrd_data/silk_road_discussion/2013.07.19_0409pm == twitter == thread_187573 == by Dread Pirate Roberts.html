				This is a great idea DPR. <br /><br />Also, this is no different (security wise) from DPR/SR posting on Reddit as a backup means of communication. <br />It is a no brainer that DPR practices airtight security methods when using twitter/reddit.. and there is no reason to assume others won&#039;t be as cautious when logging onto twitter.

I&#039;m saying that it isn&#039;t clear that DPR having a Twitter account is inherently risky for DPR, SR, or the SR community in general. There are costs to having a Twitter account, and there are costs to NOT having a Twitter account. Hopefully DPR is making the best decision.

				Additionally, what I think some might be missing is that DPR said this twitter account is for periodic updates/backup communication.. I don&#039;t see anywhere where he says he is going to start live tweeting his entire stream of thought all day and become a twitter celebrity. From what I understand, the purpose is for the benefit of the SR community. He is not in the business of seeking social-media viral fame. <br /><br />Have faith that the Pirate knows a thing or two about security :)

				To all of you expressing a concern for DPR or his wellbeing, I think you should take a step back and look at what he&#039;s accomplished in the last few years....<br /><br />He obviously took the necessary precautions to access the twitter site....probably much more than the necessary precautions.<br /><br />The only big problem here is what astor pointed out, that too many people think TOR is strictly for accessing hidden onion website, when it is (within certain guidelines) usable for most clearnet websites aswell. Undoubtedly people will probably end up copying and pasting the URL to their clearnet browser which has usernames/passwords saved and cookies enabled. An automatic logging in of your twitter account could raise some suspicion(linking it to the fact you&#039;ve logged in and are directly accessing DPR&#039;s&nbsp; &#039;tweets&#039;), but for anybody but a vendor or LARGE buyer this probably wouldn&#039;t even be worth the time for LEO.<br /><br />Depending on if your a buyer or a seller, you should have more than just TOR (a VPN going too.) to keep yourself ultimately safe whilst using TOR, however that is a discussion for a different day.<br /><br />I think it was a good move, a good way to communicate and an EASY way for any of us to remember how we can get back into contact with SR and DPR if anything were to ever hit the fan.<br /><br />Also, I really wonder, how the fuck is the Atlantis account still open? They&#039;ve probably been tweeting for months, they love media....<br /><br />Guess they really aren&#039;t that popular. DPR&#039;s account got shutdown in a matter of a few hours <br /><br />8)<br />

				LE loves to subpoena Twitter for IP addresses.

				Just a quick input from me here, DPR why don&#039;t you run a seperate hidden service from the main site and the forum just for announcements when people can&#039;t get on, so your very own twitter just on a hidden service that you have full control of. <br /><br />Just an idea, probably thought about it anyway.<br /><br />UKd

				like DPR thought, if hacking groups can have a account and stay up, even with large federal government agencies being attacked and humiliated... then certainly no one would bother a account that has very little activity and is doing nothing illegal.<br /><br />I mean c&#039;mon....anyone remember the 50 day reign of terror from LulzSec?&nbsp; They also took down the CIA&#039;s website and hacked into the Senate&#039;s website.&nbsp; You think that would be enough to piss off the government, to where they would order Twitter to take down their Twitter presence.&nbsp; They had some 280,000 followers, they were in the news daily, but their Twitter page stayed up thru it all, and was the main place to go to learn about who they were fucking with.<br /><br />Something funny about that.&nbsp; How DPR can create a account, and it gets suspended so quick, but yet other accounts stay up, even while they&#039;re actively fucking with government agencies and doing all sorts of illegal activities.&nbsp; Hell, their Twitter page is still up!<br /><br />

				Probably because some malicious people clicked the report button enough times to trigger an automated suspension. Do you really think that Twitter employees identified it and personally suspended it within hours when he hadn&#039;t posted anything that violates their terms of service? I imagine they reinstated it when they realized this.<br />

				DPR, I personally suggest that rather than have the authentication link as a tweet (which will eventually get old and get pushed to the bottom if you make any additional tweets), you click &quot;edit profile&quot; and paste the link into the bottom-right most text box (set it as your website so that it is always there at the top).

				haha, they did the same thing to me. I created a Twitter account over Tor to see who the followers are, and it was immediately suspended because of &quot;things I tweeted&quot;, which of course I hadn&#039;t tweeted anything yet. I got it unsuspended by filling out a captcha. Nice system there.<br /><br />DPR&#039;s followers are entertaining, as expected. Atlantis Marketplace, Patrick O&#039;Neill (the Weirder Web guy), Nicolas Christin (the researcher who published that paper), All Things Vice (OzFreelancer), the CRO of F-Secure, even Zooko, the Tahoe-LAFS guy and author of Zooko&#039;s Triangle. It&#039;s a who&#039;s who of the darknet and the people who follow it.<br /><br />Also some random hot chick. DPR, you would have so many groupies if you weren&#039;t anon.<br />

				I&#039;m convinced now that using exit node IPs or changing IPs frequently will get an account suspended, because I&#039;ve tweeted nothing, messaged no one, and my account was suspended again. So in the case of DPR, it may not have been trolls flagging the account or anything.

				I had to go through the account suspension process too.
