				<br />Showing offers in order of bestselling is bad for new sellers and bad for Silk Road.<br /><br />I am offering good weed at a much better price, but is is very hard to get attention when you end up on page 7 in the bestselling list, just because I just started selling.<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/9845<br /><br />At least on eBay anyone&#039;s offerings end up in the front when their auction time nears the end. <br /><br />This way there is not enough new blood and competition coming in that can keep prices low for buyers! I know you can put the offers in other orders, like New, Price etc. But I don&#039;t think anyone uses that.<br /><br />Anyone have an idea what else could be possible? I would be happy to pay for a more prominent position just for a starting boost...<br /><br />

But I also think sorting items by bestselling by default is not ideal. The user should be given an option on his settings page to choose a default.

We would need to see some stats as to how the buyers are navigating the shop-front. I like to do a search by &#039;newest&#039; first, then hit it back to the default &#039;best selling&#039;. Ideally though, I would like to see stuff added like listing by country.<br /><br />The biggest barrier I can see for new sellers (from my perspective as buyer), is lack of feedback. The lesser problem is the order of the list, because unless the list is insanely long, its good shopping practice to inspect every item on that list (of course except the ones with zero feedback &lt;--hence the real problem for new sellers).<br /><br />If other buyers here do as I do (only stats / poll / etc will know that for sure), then being on page 7 of the most sold list is not a great barrier, so long as you got something within the 1st page or two of the &#039;new&#039; list, or you are in a category that is not too long to browse all of.<br /><br />Your logic is: &quot;My sales are not good. I am on page 7 of &#039;best sellers&#039;. Therefore, my sales are not good because I am on page 7 of best sellers&quot;. But its equally as true that you are on page 7 because your sales are not good. It becomes circular logic and the premises are flawed. Without the proper data and stats is not that easy to pin a definite reason.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3813.msg32097#msg32097">Quote from: Holland_SR on October 01, 2011, 10:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Anyone have an idea what else could be possible? I would be happy to pay for a more prominent position just for a starting boost...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Best and only option is to check out the site feature requests section, and see when the new sorting and search options will be implemented. Also, Keep something in the &#039;new items&#039; list (assuming people other than me actually check that list).<br /><br />^ Also everything I just said is from buyers perspective. I notice the thread is all sellers so far, so if I missed a crucial aspect of the selling perspective, do forgive me for that.... I never listed an item so I can&#039;t fully know what its like yet. Just adding some ideas to the mix.

				As quick followup, I see you&#039;re listed in the Drugs-&gt;Cannabis-&gt;Weed section close to the top of the very first page. First page also when sorted by cheapest price. Add to that, glowing 100 for feedback. The barriers are none too many.<br /><br />The idea from streetpharmacy would be in your favor, that is -- if users can set their default list to &#039;newest&#039; in profile, it will enable that extra exposure not just to yourself, but all sellers with new product. I know I would set mine to &#039;newest&#039; permanently. Its the natural option I think, to see whats new before going to look at older popular stuff (except for band new buyers, who will want to see the popular stuff first, but they are minority here I think).<br /><br />The advantage also of having the &#039;newest&#039; screen appear first, is you get the &quot;first impressions last&quot; factor too. When someone logs in for the day, and sees your product before the others, its memorable.<br /><br />Also, consider all factors.. who is buying weed most? Are they shopping international or domestic most? Have you struck their attention with key words when they view the ad? These are not easy questions.. and answers maybe just a guess... but if being on page 1 for highest sales is not something you can control.. there are some factors which you can control, and its these factors that reward the focus of attention.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Here&#039;s a few off the top of my head:<br /><br />- Advertising here at the SR forums (or elsewhere?)<br />- Product samples in exchange for feedback<br />- Discounts<br />- Free shipping (and proper packaging!)<br />- Selling quality products<br />- Excellent customer service<br />- Attractive product photos<br />- Give samples to the SR forums shotcallers in exchange for product reviews<br />- Branding yourself or your product ie. &quot;I&#039;m the new guy with a newer, better product&quot;<br />- Of course there are many underhanded marketing tactics that I won&#039;t list, as I wouldn&#039;t want to give potential sleazeballs any ideas.<br /><br />No matter how the products are listed, there will always be a few savvy business people who will find a way to gain the upper hand. But the fact is if you have a good product and half a brain, you can find a way to gain a foothold and make sales.

				<br />How does it count &#039;bestselling&#039;, by turnover or number of deals? Historic, over what period?<br />

				As soon as I log onto the market, I go to the categories that interest me then immediately sort the listings by &#039;newest.&#039;<br /><br />If I have a reason to linger in the category after that, I sort by &#039;seller rep.&#039;<br /><br />If I see something new that interests me then I will start researching the seller there and here in the forums if I do not already know him or her.<br /><br />If I could choose a default setting it would be to sort by newest. For me, there&#039;s no utility in sorting by &#039;bestselling.&#039;

				Keep your orders flowing, the money wont stop...&nbsp; pretty soon you&#039;ll be on top!&nbsp; Dopeboy&#039;s post is pretty good advice.&nbsp; I&#039;m past around 50 orders now so far and I&#039;ve only been here selling for about a week and I&#039;m ranked #95 out of 208 sellers as of right now.&nbsp; Patience, Rome was not built in a day bro.<br /><br />Paperchasing
