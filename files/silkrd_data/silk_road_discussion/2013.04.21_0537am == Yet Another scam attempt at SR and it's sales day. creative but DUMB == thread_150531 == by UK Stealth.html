				nothing sacred any more huh uk stealth.<br /><br />nice one consider ur self 100 btc richer for the great effort u fucking stupid prick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46 seconds &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread<br />delete<br />Vote 420 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy 4/20!<br /><br />Today got off to a rough start, but now it&#039;s your chance to help make things a little smoother from now on. There have been several new ideas in the forums, and we are now looking at starting to implement some of them.<br /><br />The biggest request we get is for a new rating system. There have been discussions in the forum about what would be best, but we really want the vendors to help make the decision. You are the ones who live by the rating system, and we want to work with you to bring everyone a better experience at SR. If you would like us to focus on the ratings system, please vote by sending BTC to:<br /><br />1RATEaFf2kYmLgEMH5164EsUiz8kWrGDR<br />Vendors who send at least 0.5 BTC will be among the first eligible to use the new ratings system.<br /><br />If you have not noticed, the speed at which we are able to respond to support tickets has been rather slow lately. SR has been growing, while the staff has remained limited. We would like to implement a program where vendors can help resolve support tickets. The safest way would to be to have the tickets first go through the main staff. Depending on the severity, they will either keep it to be resolved by staff, or send it to the vendors. At any time a vendor could check the list of unresolved tickets and give support. Some tickets will require the consensus of other vendors, or a staff member to keep things safe. Tickets go to the first responder, and will be worth $10 in waived fees. If you like this idea, please send BTC to:<br /><br />1ADMiNcSUZ5bCMsA3LaDQgfyk1z65ugQe9<br />Vendors who send at least 2.5 BTC can begin in May, two months before everyone else.<br /><br />We have tried everything to make the site faster for everyone. Our most recent improvements have helped, but heavy traffic still bogs down the Tor network. We have been experimenting with adding Tor relays at various strategic locations. This seems to work, but we really need to add more to make a difference. The relays only run inside the Tor network, and never exit. Adding more relays would help the entire TOR network, and keep SR available in times of high traffic. If you like to see us add more relays, please vote by sending BTC to:<br /><br />1RELAYeP5R89C4ouunjyJdqfMeQx2XZdB<br />Vendors who send more than 5 BTC will get a private relay that always maintains the the fastest connection speed with SR. It can be easily added to your Tor configuration, and you may share it with anyone you wish.<br /><br />One of the biggest things we have been working on is a full-fledged app for SR. Our vendor app has finally moved from the alpha stage into the beta stage. It still basic, but it does everything you can do on SR, and offers additional functionality. It opens up as a simple calculator, and only opens when you enter 42271 + 37814. Once open you can specify a password, which will be used for encryption. Messages and listings can be stored and edited offline. You can generate multiple BTC wallets that can be used to keep track of different listings, and you can keep the private keys offline, so your money is always safe. You can also create custom listing templates, use a new scheduling feature, and more. We have created an API for all SR functions, and are working on maximizing the potential of our app. If you like to support the API, and the development of the vendor app, please send BTC to:<br /><br />1SRapiKveLoV13oxda9g5BhBcYGFwv4EC<br />Vendors who send at least 10 BTC will get the full API documentation, and source code for our cross-platform app. Working binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac are included in the build directory, however compiling from source is very simple with the documentation. Since the item is still in beta, there will be several updates. You will always get the latest updates and new features. Any item listed using the vendor app while it is still in beta will have ALL FEES WAIVED! As beta testers, you would be helping us work out any minor bugs before we fully release it, so we want to make it worth your while.<br /><br />SR is really becoming a great place. It&#039;s because of your hard work that SR has been able to grow the way it has. If you have any new ideas, please don&#039;t hesitate to put them forward. We appreciate everything you do for the community here, and want to help keep everything alive and well.<br /><br />We look forward to more great things.<br />Thank you all
