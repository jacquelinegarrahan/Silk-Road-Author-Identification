				If I were to sell shrooms at $140 an ounce, and really pure coke at say, $90 a gram (shipped from inside USA), and had a lot of supply and good vendor habits - how likely is it that becoming a vendor would be worth the time and effort? How long does it take vendors to get established, and how much do some of these vendors of products like this stand to make once established, theoretically?<br /><br />Those are the two main things I&#039;d be looking to move on the road. I use the road to acquire pills for local resale, but have never sold on the road.

				The shroom market definitely has room for more vendors, especially at that price. You&#039;d do well with coke too as long as you provide good customer service and quality product.

				In order for vendors to become established you need to create a good fan base of customers<br />and understand how shipping and bitcoin processes work.<br /><br />Before you even think about becoming a vendor, understand how to convert your bitcoins to cash and vice versa<br />without raising an alarm, how to send packages without getting caught (usps, vac seal, printed label, etc.), etc.<br /><br />Try sending out samples, free trials, etc. to further your base of customers.<br />AND always compete with the prices of SR, if you are selling oz. of shrooms for 140<br />I might as well go to Rocker who has over 300 transaction and sells for around the same price.<br /><br />

				Yeah, when I mentioned good vendor practices, etc - that is definitely what I mean. Free samples, advertising, promoting good feedback, quickly handling any issues that pop up. Basically, the same stuff that you&#039;d do running a business in real life, and then some. I am working on a few small scale businesses (legit) in real life, so I understand that you have to really push the good aspects hard, early on more so than ever. <br /><br />You have to set yourself apart. I could probably get away with doing some really big free sample/sales at ridiculous prices to start the ball rolling (on the shrooms).<br /><br />On the coke, I&#039;d have to keep it more straight up.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if it is worth it, however. I mean, time is valuable - the shipping, security, order issues, resolutions, problem solving, advertising, inventory management, etc - I wonder how much some of the more established guys in these 2 markets make in a month? I suppose it varies. I am not asking to be spoon fed, but is there a way I can research and come to my own conclusions? <br /><br />Only way I can think of is look at total transactions, and average dollar amount of their product and divide by as many months as they&#039;ve been a vendor, really.

				You could look at the recent feedback to get a feel for how many transactions each person has got per month. Or you could simply ask. Like everyone else said, price to beat the longer-serving vendors. Offer fast (and discounted/free) shipping, and domestic vendors from the USA are always welcome.<br /><br />Customer service is the key.

				Thanks for the replies guys, I really appreciate the effort to educate me a bit. Hopefully I can be one spreading the love on here, rather than just gobbling it all up.

				Biggest recommendation I can make it figure out a system early on and stick to it and improve it. A good system will make preping the orders a breeze, limit mistakes. For instance I prepack my orders so all I need to do is print out the address and stick some stamps on.
