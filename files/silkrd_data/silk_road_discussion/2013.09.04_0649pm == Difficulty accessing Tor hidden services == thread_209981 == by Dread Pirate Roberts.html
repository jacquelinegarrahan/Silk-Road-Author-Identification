				Thanks DPR and Team:-)<br /><br />It does seem like the more hidden services are harder to access than other sites using Tor. I really have no Idea, but, I&#039;m guessing they are being targeted by troublemakers rather than this just being random overload of the system. Or, maybe it is something about being well hidden makes the random overload affect my favorite hidden sites more badly.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck with the ongoing battle!

				Thank you DRP &amp; Crew.<br /><br />Impossible to get on SR right now where I am (even using Brute Determination), only just managed the forums...<br /><br />Question: Does physical location have anything to do with access to and speed of the Tor network?<br /><br />Common sense says &#039;no, once you are in, you are in&#039;... But in my location it seems to always be very much slower when the majority of the population here (who may have relays set up on their home computers) may be asleep and have them turned off. (Interestingly enough my slowest time is probably the most busiest in North America)<br /><br />See ya! :)

				I think you can see the Tor congestion problem using&nbsp; &quot;Net Map&quot; in Tor Vidalia.<br />In the window under the Map, you can see the various node failures when you try to connect to SR.<br /><br />&nbsp; Nodes like pascal3 and srvph3xat have been getting hammered.&nbsp; Earlier today, many nodes had uptimes of and hour or less.&nbsp; Now they are more like 8 hours,&nbsp; which looks better,&nbsp; but I&#039;m still worried that so much traffic is hitting pascal3.<br /><br />You may want to upgrade to Tor Bundle 2.4 Beta, which has smarter routing.<br /><br />Stay safe.

				Atlantis IS actually loading ALOT quicker, but I believe SR is loading slower because SOO many more people are actually trying to access it vs. Atlantis.&nbsp; Now don&#039;t think I am an Atlantis shill, because their site was loading faster, I actually was able to sign up for an account and look around.....&nbsp; &nbsp;I logged out and will not log in again unless SR is gets shut down.&nbsp; Atlantis just doesn&#039;t have anywhere close to the userbase of SR.

That&#039;s also why it keeps working (for up to 10 minutes) after you got to the login screen because a circuit was finally established.<br />On connection attempts Tor of course waits for nodes to time out before trying other ones. With using a new identity you most likely cancel that waiting time because the circuit gets closed anyway. So it might be possible that you speed things up a little by doing this. However it&#039;s also possible that you cancel an attempt that would have built a circuit successfully.<br /><br />Think this is more of a placebo thing and when it works after hitting the &#039;new identity&#039; button, it&#039;s more of a coincidence because that circuit would most likely have been tried next anyway.

				I think that, given the nature of what we do, we have to expect some intermittent downtime.&nbsp; <br /><br />Accessing outside of north America&#039;s peak hours is working successfully for me.&nbsp; This morning, browsing hidden services is lightning fast in Europe, however, when the USA rise from slumber later on today it will cause a huge rise in the number of Tor users.&nbsp; Coupled with the more determined attacks from LE, this might impact upon the global Tor network.&nbsp; A bit simplistic perhaps, but that&#039;s my theory.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Many Tor relays already updated to version 0.2.4.17-rc (276 of &gt;4000 so far). These relays will give Tor clients with version 0.2.4.x a higher priority.

That doesn&#039;t tell the whole story, because relay selection is weighted by bandwidth, so if the top 600 relays by bandwidth were running Tor 0.2.4, then 90% of your circuits would go through those relays.

These are the theories as far as I see it:<br /><br />* Atlantis has a vastly better programmed website making it process traffic a lot better. Solution: Make Silk Road work more efficiently.<br />* Atlantis has vastly less Visitors than Silk Road in comparison and thus works better. Solution: Silk Road should acquire a lot more Servers for more Processing Power and Bandwidth.<br />* Atlantis is using considerably less bandwidth per User than Silk Road making it load much faster. Solution: Make Silk Road consume less Bandwidth, in other words simply better programming.<br />* Atlantis is not effected by this Botnet at all while Silk Road grinds to a halt. Solution: This is basically impossible which would indicate there&#039;s currently a&nbsp; targeted DDoS against Silk Road which for some reason hasn&#039;t been Announced, hoping it will go away on it&#039;s own.<br /><br />All I can see is people sticking their sands in the sand or ridiculing those claiming Atlantis is working better when it clearly is, it is better to acknowledge that the problem exist and try and find out exactly why this is - unless there&#039;s a lot going on behind the scenes which we&#039;re not told. If this Botnet thing disappears in the coming days I&#039;m afraid people will just forget about this whole thing when it clearly wasn&#039;t the Botnet responsible for the majority of the slowdown here on Silk Road these last few days.

I have been able to get on SR regularly. No trouble vending effectively when SR is up.<br />The tips and tricks:<br /><br />Put on your tinfoil hat :-) (Optional)<br />Make sure silkroad is allowed on noscript (may not really matter)<br />Go to a Https website (you trust) in a browser tab to make sure you have a good Tor connection.<br />Once it loads fully, then, pretty quickly attempt to load SR on a different tab.<br />Once you do so, do Not look at any other tab until SR loads. Keep you mouse cursor on the page SR is about to load on.<br />Keep the cursor moving on that page (apparently, if you click over to another tab or stop moving your cursor, The page gives up trying as hard to load as it assumes you are not really there anymore).<br />Be patient and keep trying if it does not work. I don&#039;t think clicking &quot;try again&quot; (on a failed connection page) works as well as hitting a link/bookmark, or, &quot;go&quot; or &quot;enter&quot; in the address bar. It is annoying to be patient, but, if you get in it is usually a lot quicker afterwards.<br />If this is not working, even when you are patient, you can try right clicking the green onion icon to try a &quot;New Identity&quot;.<br /><br />If you get to the log in page and the captcha has letters but no numbers, reload the page until it has both.<br />Once you are in, stay active or you may start to get a slower and slower connection. If that happens, be patient and speeds should pick up again.<br />If SR gets really, really slow; look forward to getting logged out and having to re-log in. I think of that as SR (or Tor?) clearing out the bots. Afterwards things usually run fast again.<br /><br />If you took my &quot;Put on your tinfoil hat :-)&quot; comment seriously at the beginning, you might want to keep it on. Most experts would probably tell you you can take it off now, though :-)

These are the theories as far as I see it:<br /><br />* Atlantis has a vastly better programmed website making it process traffic a lot better. Solution: Make Silk Road work more efficiently.<br />* Atlantis has vastly less Visitors than Silk Road in comparison and thus works better. Solution: Silk Road should acquire a lot more Servers for more Processing Power and Bandwidth.<br />* Atlantis is using considerably less bandwidth per User than Silk Road making it load much faster. Solution: Make Silk Road consume less Bandwidth, in other words simply better programming.<br />* Atlantis is not effected by this Botnet at all while Silk Road grinds to a halt. Solution: This is basically impossible which would indicate there&#039;s currently a&nbsp; targeted DDoS against Silk Road which for some reason hasn&#039;t been Announced, hoping it will go away on it&#039;s own.<br /><br />All I can see is people sticking their sands in the sand or ridiculing those claiming Atlantis is working better when it clearly is, it is better to acknowledge that the problem exist and try and find out exactly why this is - unless there&#039;s a lot going on behind the scenes which we&#039;re not told. If this Botnet thing disappears in the coming days I&#039;m afraid people will just forget about this whole thing when it clearly wasn&#039;t the Botnet responsible for the majority of the slowdown here on Silk Road these last few days.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You forgot the conspiracy theories:<br />Atlantians are behind the Bot or DDos attacks,<br />LE is runnign the attacks and letting traffic through to their Atlantis &quot;honeypot&quot;,<br />Atlantis is not as deeply (safely) hidden and so traffic has an easier time reaching it,<br />...<br />I don&#039;t think Atlantis staff is doing this, but, did not want your list to be incomplete.

				They could be using the botnet to attempt deanonymiziation of SR servers.&nbsp; It could also be that for securities sake, there are a limited number of pointers in the TOR network servicing SR.&nbsp; I know if you have too many it makes it easier to de-anonymize, even if services work faster.

				The problem with hidden services is that, unlike with connections through Tor to the clearnet, there need to be 6 relays between you and the Silk Road server working properly. For clearnet connections you only need 3 relays to work properly. However only 1 in 10 relays have the latest version of Tor installed. So 9 of 10 relays are susceptible to getting overloaded by the botnets circuit building requests.

However the difference has been while most sites have been loading extremely slowly they have been working consistently at almost all times, it has just been a question of how long loading time. Silk Road on the other hand has been erratic during this whole ordeal and working at best roughly 10-20 % of the time, to then say Silk Road is performing exactly as well as all other sites is not something that should have to be explained as a theory. This is not some event that transpired many years ago, it&#039;s been happening the last week or so and there&#039;s also plenty of Information of Silk Road not being able to handle large traffic loads on previous occasions ( curiously Atlantis didn&#039;t have any problems during these periods either ).<br /><br />Also I don&#039;t see saying things are running fine now is even remotely relevant, that is obviously because the problem to a large extent has been fixed by Relays updating their Client or simply using the new Experimental Version. My point in the end is Silk Road seems to have highly ineffective coding and it&#039;s not apparent until there&#039;s stress of some sort, ie. high load from many visitors or this botnet as example. Now Atlantis could be explained away previously with they didn&#039;t have the same amount of traffic as Silk Road, which was and still is true. However with this botnet problem that point doesn&#039;t stand any longer on it&#039;s own as it&#039;s absurd to claim some sites take more of a beating than others, and I have seen no admission Silk Road had any other problems than the botnet itself ( for example a DDoS attack from an unknown entity ). Can&#039;t have the cake and eat it too.
