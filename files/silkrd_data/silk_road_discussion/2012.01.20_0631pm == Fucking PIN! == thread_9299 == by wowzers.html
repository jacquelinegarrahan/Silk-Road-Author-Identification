				what is it? Just about to place my first order of the year and I&#039;m being asked for my PIN. I&#039;ve definitely not set one, is there some sort of default one I don&#039;t know about?&nbsp; :(<br /><br /><br />blurgh, just reading about problems other people have had. <br />A real piss-off as I have some orders I really need to place immediately, I seriously can&#039;t wait 7 days...&nbsp; :-\

				How old is your account? Created within the last year, it was called &quot;withdrawl,&quot; during account setup. You had to of set one, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t have an SR account. If it was made &#039;10 or earlier then its possible to not have one. In either case go to tech support, theirs like 5,000 of these threads.

				Signed up in June 2011, definitely don&#039;t remember setting a &#039;withdrawal&#039; password and I&#039;m certain I haven&#039;t needed one to move BTC between SR and my wallet. Yeah, I should have UTFSE, been reading other peoples experiences. Guess I&#039;m just going to have to wait a week, set up a new buyers account in the mean time and risk finalizing immediately. excellent.

				SR just began implementing a system that requires a second password/PIN (depending on which part of the site you are on, they are the same thing) last month. If you have an account which was created prior to this system being implemented you were supposed to be prompted to create the password/PIN upon login, although many users are claiming to never have been prompted by such a screen.<br /><br />As for how long it takes SR to respond after the required 7 day wait for a PIN reset? well it took SR around 20 hours to get back to me and reset my PIN once those 7 days passed. <br /><br />For clarification my account was one which was created prior to the second password/PIN being implemented and was prompted to create one, I simply forgot what I set it as, therefore I can only speculate whether or not some users were never prompted to create this second password/PIN.
