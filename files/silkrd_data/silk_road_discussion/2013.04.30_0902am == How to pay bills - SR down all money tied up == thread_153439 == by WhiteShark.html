				Hello Roaders<br /><br />First off lets hope SR is back soon! All my money is tied in escrow. I see packages have arrived, but without people able to sign on they can&#039;t finalize and I can&#039;t get my money.<br /><br />I know most people here make like $4000 a day and stuff but I am very small time. Just a simple regular mom making cash to make ends meet. With all this money in escrow I do not<br /><br />have enough to pay the bills at the moment. Anyone have any suggestions. Sure a day or two won&#039;t make a different but if it goes up to 7 days or more it will really start to cost me and ruin me, no funds.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br />W. Shark

				I know you say that you&#039;re money is in escrow but perhaps you have some bitcoins around that you have access to so the best I can do is provide you with this link that will allow you to pay your bills with bitcoins.&nbsp; billpayforcoins.com

				From the sound of DPR I don&#039;t think it will be 7 days until the site is up.<br /><br />We are all hurting thanks to this attack White Shark, I don&#039;t know what to tell you except maybe a credit card advance?<br /><br />The drug business is a risky one, sometimes the paychecks don&#039;t come every 2 weeks.

				Get to the point please, are you here begging for money so your family don&#039;t starve? <br /><br />I won&#039;t be sending you anything, you make enough money as it is and it should be your responsibility to make sure you don&#039;t leave money sitting in your account. If youre really desperate may I suggest you put a little dick in your mouth to put a little bit of food in your kids mouth. Youre already drug dealing mommy, sure it won&#039;t be too hard to change into street corner hooker mommy

SR uses a backup wallet at the very least so it might be possible to have funds sent to that if you contact SR support.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind for the future - never rely on escrow funds. Its one thing to have funds in your SR wallet that you can&#039;t access for bills but if you rely on escrow funds you will inevitably fall into trouble. Many people do not finalize and you could be waiting up to 17 days for your money. Always ask yourself - if I don&#039;t see this cash for 17 days, will I still be able to make ends meet? <br /><br />Good luck to you.

If you were a vendor on SR then you could access private chat. If you were a vendor we would be more than happy to help you out. Just back us on inventory.<br /><br />If not this is a scam, which seems likely as its a sob story. Frankly its been three days as a vendor on SR 3 days is bullshit. i am using this unfortunate experience as a vacation. <br /><br />In anycase keep us posted if you are real, I got coins if you really are a vendor and are stuck and have hungry kids. We arent all cold hearted fucks, but there are a lot of scammers here. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Gotmilk<br /><br />Gotmilk

Sucks that among such great people a big loser like you exists. And no my family would not starve, I am not a dumbass how can a family starve I do not rely solely on SR. I have bills to pay none the less.....so why don&#039;t you learn from everyone else here and get some damn manners. Yes I am a drug dealing mommy, but I am also an SR exclusive drug dealing mommy. You think anyone around me has any idea I do this? I am safe, and I stay clean and dont have to deal with fishy smelling dicks like your face. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey just some friendly advice from someone who solely knows drug traffickers, traders, dealers and everybody who helps those people out with all kinds of things; everybody always tells everybody that you gotta have a plan beforehand. You cant expect to do this forever and definitely be prepared for anything! This is a must. <br /><br />Personally I got scammed (ripped) out of 250k dollars in october by the people who cashed out my bitcoins, and subsequently 450k dollars in escrow. I wasn&#039;t prepared for such a hit, I didnt have a backup plan; and thus I was forced to spend 2 months looking for another option to cash out large amounts of btc. Now everything worked out because I had my savings. <br /><br />I could have quit back then, and lived off the interest on the bitcoin. You have to take care of your family, like I take care for all of my employees, but I tell them as well that they cant keep doing this forever and have to spend their money they make with me wisely. I dont hire anyone who doesn&#039;t have at least a parttime job. <br /><br />Though, that said, I&#039;m that guy too nice to say no, and when a struggling business owner asked me for 236k last summer, I immediately cashed in those bitcoins and provided the loan at just 10%. Of course he wouldn&#039;t be struggling if he was wise with his money to begin with, and he has barely made payments and is behind with them. At that time bitcoin were like 8-10 dollars each, if i remember correctly. I washed all the coins for him and am just getting 10% back, over the course of years, imagine if I hadnt touched that pile of bitcoins and let it sit there, as I did before and continue to do so. <br /><br />Well what&#039;s done is done I guess, and if you have a plan to expand your current business or have an interesting offer, I am willing to loan you an amount in BTC or cash USD.

				With all due respect to everyone here and the OP, i&#039;m a bit surprised there werent more responses like scotlandyard&#039;s, as it did seem a bit like an attempt to get money.
