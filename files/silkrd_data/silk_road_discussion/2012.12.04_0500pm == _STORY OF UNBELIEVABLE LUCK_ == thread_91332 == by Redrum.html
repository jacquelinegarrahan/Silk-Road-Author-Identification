				Yesterday I needed bitcoins so I decided to try gangster16, I sent a 500.00 moneypak. About 13 hrs later I message this dirtbag and no response, so I had another mp for 165.00 I sent to Sugar Mama . As soon as Sugar Mama converts the 165.00, I decide to cancel gangster16 and send Sugar Mama the 500.00 as well after canceling the transaction. Sugar Mama messages me that she already had the 500.00 mp but from someone else allday. So we realize that gangster16 sent my moneypak of 500.00 to right away Sugar Mama to basically collect the coins and by luck she didnt cash it allday(12hrs+). So after showing that I was indeed the original owner using a picture of the receipt + moneypak I got my 40btcs 4am in the morning. So 1st do not use any of these new BTC vendors, most make like 5000 before they&#039;re caught, 2nd Stay away from Gangster16 and his &quot;no fee adds&quot;. I got real lucky but I feel for those scammed by these POS`s, hopefully we can find a way to get rid of these scammers as soon as they pull 1 scam with an imediate refund. Anyway hope whoever thinks twice before sending your moneypaks to strangers, expessially noobies.

				Sugar Mama is the queen of sr. She is the matriarch provider of life, love and coins in this crazy world. She is the Ms. Garrett of this community...and I am the tootie...or sometimes gerry, blare&#039;s retarded cousin, it just depends on how i feel that day.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I got scammed like this once, didn&#039;t turn out so well for me though.&nbsp; I tried to use Sugar Mama but I had issues getting her the money through MG (MG&#039;s problem not Sugar Mama&#039;s) so I just figured out the process of getting BTC onto SR myself.&nbsp; If I ever get tired of the process though (and trust me I do) I will contact Sugar Mama she is a pro!
