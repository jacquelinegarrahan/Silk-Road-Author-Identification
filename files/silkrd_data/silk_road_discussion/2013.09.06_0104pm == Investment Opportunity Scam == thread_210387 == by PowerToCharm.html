				Found this in my inbox a short while ago. I chose not to invest.<br /><br />SilkRoad vendors,<br /><br />We have also begun adding new features and support staff to better assist you in your transactions.<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer an unique opportunity to a some of our established vendors. The chance to invest in SilkRoad. Think about these as the war bonds needed to completely win the war on drugs.<br /><br />I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1% of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; SilkRoad admin share, staff etc.) which currently is expected to be ~$100,000-200,000 per month.<br /><br />Shares will be priced at $200 for a 0.1% share, at the exchange rate listed on the bottom of each page. There is no limit on the amount of shares you may buy. Dividends will be payed out quarterly equates to 2.5% of SilkRoad&#039;s income.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to pay for an improved user interface, advertising, additional servers and additional staff.<br /><br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below from your account or you will have to contact support with the transaction ID, these are then tracked internally.<br /><br />Investment payments should be sent to:<br /><br />1LUw4ec2JpnTgnrvwkqhpEjJLoim2tUqHo<br /><br /><br />After your order is confirmed an investor area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date. You will also view the pay-out schedule, cancel investments.<br /><br />This is strictly first come, first served basis. We will send out another announcement once we stop accepting new investors. Again, this is the chance to be a part of SilkRoad and a part of history.<br /><br />Thank you and good luck.<br /><br />Vendor Support

				Can you forward the message to me on the main site- username cirrus.&nbsp; <br /><br />For all others STAY AWAY from these scams, they are most definitely a scam and it isn&#039;t the first time they have tried this. <br /><br />
