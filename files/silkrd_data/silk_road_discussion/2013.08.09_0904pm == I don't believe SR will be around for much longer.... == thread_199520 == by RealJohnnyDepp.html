				With everything happening lately, I think sooner then later, shit is going 2 hit the fan and all of our Journeys throughout the Road will eventually come 2 a halting end unfortunately. DPR has done an excellent job, but I don&#039;t think this will last much longer. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s sad for me 2 say this, but I personally believe eventually shit will start getting even more serious and the FED/GOVERNMENT at the end of the day will have it&#039;s way and will win the fight over DPR and SR. No matter how much protection/security measures you are taking, the FEDS/GOVERNMENT will most likely prevail, in my opinion.<br /><br />I sincerely hope and pray that none of you fine SR Buyers and Vendors don&#039;t end up eventually getting locked up and having your life&#039;s ruined over this shit.<br /><br /><br />

				If they had a working root exploit for the SR/forum software they would have used it already. Maybe they&#039;ll have one in the future, but you can&#039;t predict this. No need to believe in the end of the world just because some people with superficial knowledge spread fear, uncertainty and doubt.

				Honestly I don&#039;t even think they would shut it down if they could. Think about it, what do they get by shutting it down? One big day of headline news, that&#039;s it. I seriously think they would rather occasionally bust a few buyers that are purchasing large amounts, and very rarely bust vendors when they can. They want people to go to jail if anything. They don&#039;t get shit if they somehow &quot;pull the plug&quot;. <br /><br />I could be dead wrong, but this is the way I see it.

				Where there is a will there is a way. SR will always exist, or at least some variant of it. If SR ever gets shut down, all of the users WILL migrate to the other markets. If all those markets get shut down, some people will start up new ones. It is inevitable. People have drugs to sell and online is by far the safest way. Massive Criminal Syndicates can get vendor accounts and make millions of dollars per month on SR with a very minimal risk compared to selling in real life. You actually believe that if these markets get shut down another one wont spring right up? <br /><br />SR is still very young, and it IS the new generation of drug dealing, and it&#039;s only getting started. It has a long ways to go. <br /><br />There&#039;s also another reason why sites like this will ALWAYS exist.... even if a person of interest isn&#039;t selling drugs... a very skilled computer programmer/html expert etc, would make thousands of dollars per day starting up and running a site like this, soley off the commision they make, that is if their site is the dominant one. Hell, if SR went down and no other market was availible, I would drop everything I am doing and start development of a new site. <br /><br />For every government personel trying to find a way to stop SR, to stop the darkweb, there will be ten thousand there trying to increase security, increase anonymity, to increase the longevity, of this place.<br /><br />LONG LIVE SR.

				SR is too big of an enterprise to die now. Don&#039;t you think they would have thought of these types of scenarios already?<br /><br />My bet is they have the SR setup copied to a few USBs in different parts of the world. If SR were ever to go down, these other ones would make it back to the darknet in someway. Perhaps SR sleeper cells in no way connected to SR are just waiting, as an insurance. Or maybe mailed to people who could be trusted with the continuation of this place.<br /><br />Maybe SR is already being rotated around a few different groups of people working together and everytime there is an unscheduled maintenance, thats one team breaking down to move and another team setting up.<br /><br /><br /><br />Buyers, vendors and even DPRs will come and go, but SilkRoad will remain.

				My friend&nbsp; RealJohnnyDepp. I totally disagree with your opinion.<br /><br />First of all because your thought is showing pessimism. Negative thoughts should be avoided especially when it comes to matters that make us happy. Happy thoughts for things that makes us glad. Always.<br /><br />Secondly I don&#039;t think that DPR is a kid who has managed to set up this market out of luck. SR has been attacked many times and it is still online. People who are working on its stability are not just same normal moderators. Don&#039;t forget that the greatest hackers work with the people and not with the system. Plus I am sure that DPR has a massive support from people who has abilities to help this market go for long.<br /><br />And finally I want to quote a line from Guy Fawkes (V from Vendetta):<br />An Idea cannot be killed.<br /><br />Take care my friend and stay positive!<br /><br />Adamiz

				It will never go away SR type marketplaces will be here and will grow. they cant enforce onion and if they do then SR will just move around, maybe there will be a few different hosting options. <br /><br />Technically SR, BMR, AtL - these sites dont sell drugs they are online market sites. I am not sure it so cut and dry and frankly they cant stop the WWW I doubt they can shut down this movement.

				&quot;Silk Road was founded in February 2011.[13] On June 1st, Gawker did a profile story on the site,[7] which led to &quot;internet buzz&quot;[13] and an increase in website traffic.[5] US Senator Charles Schumer asked federal authorities like the DEA and Department of Justice to shut down the website.[14] However, authorities haven&#039;t been able to close the domain because it is hosted as a hidden service on the Tor network.&quot;<br /><br />The quote above proves the DEA and most likely every other federal organization that deals with drugs has been using SO many of their resources to try and shut the road down since June 1st 2011, MORE THEN TWO YEARS AGO! And now that the road is working better then ever, has beaten ever attack thrown at it and just keeps growing massively bigger and stronger each day is going to be shut down NOW?! Dude, your WAY off. The road is going nowhere, it would already be long gone if they had anyway of taking it down.<br /><br />I am sorry and mean no offense to the OP but this thread is stupid and needs to be deleted. Why spread negative rumors man?

				If SR goes down, its backs to the old encrypted menus thru email for most. This doesnt stop drug use, but it does stop the pooling of money, which is the feds main interest, to break down any concentration of wealth not on their team and dissipate it.&nbsp; The war on drugs has nothing to do with drug or money, its about power and influence. Just standing back and looking at it, I believe cryptocurrencies, work hours and e-money will be attacked before SR. 10 years from now drugs may even be legal, under the guise that you have to purchase them from a government owned source and the funds could only be deducted through your implanted health/finance chip. Starting to ramble but its important to know those who oppose us do not oppose drugs, or have financial greed. Much bigger than that

				It will happen eventually, let&#039;s face it, no party lasts forever.&nbsp; I don&#039;t however see any signs of imminent threat, and it&#039;d be hard to predict as to when that will come (so relax and enjoy while the music still plays!).&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />However I&#039;ll not damn the OP, as discussing the topic is worthwhile, it could help us think through the situation.&nbsp; <br /><br />The attackers (LE, or competitors/criminals) are relentless and SR has no means of counter-attacking (or hopes of defeating it&#039;s opponents).&nbsp; So from a military point of view, we&#039;re in a seige/defense situation, which in&nbsp; the long term is untenable (a seige mentality is normally considered self-defeating in the long-term in military schools of thought, especially against a better supplied opponent).&nbsp; <br /><br />Seiges end when the defenses fall or the supplies are exhausted.&nbsp; <br /><br />In our scenario, I&#039;d expect that the end would come in the form of a technical failure leading to a breach (defense failure) or an attack on BTC (in the seige analogy the supply lines for the beseiged SR).&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Given all the press lately, I&#039;m inclined to expect the later.&nbsp; LE has already made it harder to get BTC, and if they are able to continue to squeeze that life-line, it will be very bad for us indeed.&nbsp; <br /><br />What think you of my reasoning?&nbsp; :-)<br />

				I was actually going to start my own thread on this subject, however I would have started the thread off differently and asked what people&#039;s opinions were of the future longevity of the SR. Not what the OP has done and basically said it&#039;s going to get shut down. <br /><br />Another poster on this thread mentioned the fact that the SR is about a lot more than just being able to buy your chosen vice off the net and have it delivered. The whole organization stands for a lot more than that, and gets very political. Something which is obvious and that I won&#039;t get into in this post. However, I wholeheartedly agree with that poster. It&#039;s not just about being able to buy and sell such items. It&#039;s an ideology on people&#039;s freedom and choice that has been put into practice, and stands up to current legislation. It&#039;s built on a platform that provides an outlet to people who may be oppressed or threatened by their government, and to those that wish for the need to voice their own opinion in safety and communicate with other that feel the same way.<br /><br />Long live SR. DPR, you&#039;re doing a fantastic job.

				In any given network, the ability to shut it down depends on a few factors.<br /><br />1) Whether or not the network has a central point at all<br />2) Whether or not the network has a central point, where the outlying is disconnected from others following the central being disconnected (all connections are 1:1 to the center and only the center)<br />3) Where in the event of a decentralized network, the community operates in physical proximity, whereby the network whilst decentralized, is centrally located.<br />4) Whether or not within the community, should at any point a central portion be eliminated, another is capable of springing up.<br /><br />These are conditions that are considered not only when talking about logical networks involving devices, but those of humans as well. Hackers, as much as governments, deal with this problem when presented with the very question at hand.<br /><br />If #1 or #2 are true, then the solution is simple. This is why the prison system puts gang leaders in special isolation with no outside contact. <br /><br />If they are not, well, this is why al qaeda and the taliban are so hard to put down.<br /><br />If #3 is true, then they&#039;d have bombed us already and blamed it on someone else.<br /><br />And, last but not least:<br /><br />Since #4 is true, we will never die. We will never go away.<br /><br />Beating my chest for the movement aside, lets examine some facts.<br /><br />We are a mostly non-hostile, non-violent group that causes no harm except in the eyes of the Baby Boomer government.<br /><br />We operate wholely on TOR, a CIA invention. TOR&#039;s use for the CIA is two fold: its existence gives terrorists (and CP and other fucktard criminals) the belief they are safe in the anonymous environment. Heavy use, masks the existence of the CIA, sitting there to catch those stupid criminals that they SHOULD be catching.<br /><br />We are a core component to TOR&#039;s existence. We make it work. Our presence here, the more that visit us, only makes TOR a better system. We are not pablo escobar. We are not manuel noriega. We are not mounting an army and storming the whitehouse. We are not planning embassy bombs. We are getting high, and talking like idiots on a forum from our chairs. That is hardly a priority for the already slashed budget.<br /><br />The DEA and the CIA do not like eachother. Fortunately, the CIA has been dealing drugs without the DEA&#039;s consent for the past 80 years. You are probably buying some of it right now, or have today. It&#039;s ok. You&#039;re helping your country. It&#039;s better than donating.<br /><br />The DEA and the FBI on the other hand, were selling tagged guns to the cartels across the boarder, in person. They then lost those weapons. This is not a good indication of a well organized, successful effort against what should have been a SIMPLE undertaking. The NSA and the CIA have all the budgets now, and the DEA and the FBI are out getting caught with hookers, and they&#039;re still not out of the hot water over the whole guns thing.<br /><br />But, of course, we have a conspiracy theory at every turn. Look, it costs a lot of money to organize a sting operation, especially one over a network that is basically anonymous. To do so, they&#039;d have to go through a great effort to not only identify you, but to prove that identity, and then prove that acting upon that is of value after spending all that fucking money to do the first part. Don&#039;t forget, the second part costs money too. Then, they actually have to ACT upon that action that they&#039;ve now approved. Which, after paying for the approval, and bribing a few other officials to make sure the approval doesn&#039;t get leaked, and then of course paying the press to not leak it either so we don&#039;t catch wind of it, they then have to actually pay the agents to go do it.<br /><br />Yes, there are some people on here that probably would fit the receipt on that bill. They&#039;re in the CIA. Go back a few points, and circle back each time until you get the point.

Our presence here, the more that visit us, only makes TOR a better system. We are not pablo escobar. We are not manuel noriega. We are not mounting an army and storming the whitehouse. We are not planning embassy bombs. We are getting high, and talking like idiots on a forum from our chairs. That is hardly a priority for the already slashed budget.<br /><br />The DEA and the CIA do not like eachother. Fortunately, the CIA has been dealing drugs without the DEA&#039;s consent for the past 80 years. You are probably buying some of it right now, or have today. It&#039;s ok. You&#039;re helping your country. It&#039;s better than donating.<br /><br />The DEA and the FBI on the other hand, were selling tagged guns to the cartels across the boarder, in person. They then lost those weapons. This is not a good indication of a well organized, successful effort against what should have been a SIMPLE undertaking. The NSA and the CIA have all the budgets now, and the DEA and the FBI are out getting caught with hookers, and they&#039;re still not out of the hot water over the whole guns thing.<br /><br />But, of course, we have a conspiracy theory at every turn. Look, it costs a lot of money to organize a sting operation, especially one over a network that is basically anonymous. To do so, they&#039;d have to go through a great effort to not only identify you, but to prove that identity, and then prove that acting upon that is of value after spending all that fucking money to do the first part. Don&#039;t forget, the second part costs money too. Then, they actually have to ACT upon that action that they&#039;ve now approved. Which, after paying for the approval, and bribing a few other officials to make sure the approval doesn&#039;t get leaked, and then of course paying the press to not leak it either so we don&#039;t catch wind of it, they then have to actually pay the agents to go do it.<br /><br />Yes, there are some people on here that probably would fit the receipt on that bill. They&#039;re in the CIA. Go back a few points, and circle back each time until you get the point.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very nicely said :) +1 Do it again some time ;)

				If SR were to go down, another site would take it&#039;s place. TOR will eventually become super anonymous and even more secure over time. Either that or an even more secure dark web project will appear that will surpass TOR. <br /><br />Think about it, someone will come up with a design so impenetrable so anonymous that not even the FBI will be able to break it. Secure connections to it through L2TP, public private keys, cryptography or some other security mechanism. The connection will of course need to lose the tracing characteristics of TCP/IP and completely mask its identity. Maybe cross spoofing, mixing the connections, mangling it with encryption then lose all capability to see where the connection was coming from. Total secure, encrypted connections, end to end with the ability to self check itself against attacks and monitor the security of the connection. <br /><br />I believe that the dark web will ultimately prevail for complete privacy. The technology is here, it just requires working out and implementation.

I think they&#039;re more worried about drug cartels anyway. Let&#039;s be real, how can you be violent over the road?

				Gonna be brutally honest here. I dont think feds will ever win the &quot;war on drugs&quot; or the war against silkroad. My reason? Our community is too damn smart. We&#039;re also far less limited than the feds. The cryptoanarchy/silkroad community isn&#039;t bound by the same rules and regulations that federal agencies are. If one door closes another one opens. If they make a move on our community, we respond with appropriate action. I don&#039;t think federales will ever have a &quot;game winning&quot; move on us.

				Maybe you didn&#039;t try to be a dick but you succeeded. We do not need to create widespread panic and fear off nothing other than gossip you yourself claim to have been sourced from random forum discussions. I am sticking with my positive thinking that this place will stay around for years and years to come since it has already. Ha Ha LE you can suck it along with Chuck Schumer. Develop strong relationships with certain vendors that one day even if the road goes down can still be worked with outside of S.R. if no other solution is available. In the meantime enjoy the road and keep the concerns to factual information, not &quot;i heard this on the internet so it must be true&quot;. Everything written on the internet is not actually true. How do I know this you might ask? I read it on the internet.

The reason we want to see more markets flourish is so that free trade can expand—and people can learn to live in peace with one another through cooperative action rather than stealing, scarcity and fear.<br /><br />SR decreases the scarcity of some of our most precious earthy goods. It is the administrator&#039;s responsibility to develop himself to the level as to make an impenetrable cryptofortress... and to constantly, obsessively interact with and protect the system from threats, for his life, and the lives of many others. And it is the people&#039;s responsibility to secure themselves, as this is also necessary to keep the whole system running.<br /><br />We have to realize that we can subvert scarcity, by creativity. Do not clutch to the one thing you have... seek to create more.

				&#039;Although you know...with all this &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; around maybe those SR users who do it right will actually be less likely to get caught&nbsp; Like the expression for bear attacks &quot;You don&#039;t have to be able to out run the bear, you just have to be able to out run the slowest person in your group.&quot;&#039;<br /><br />Neat, but what if you&#039;re the only one? We shouldn&#039;t underestimate the bear. But ultimately, this is an excellent metaphor. LE are the bear. They hunt their prey effectively based on the formidable resources they have at their disposal. But we are the humans, and long before SR came into play, we&#039;ve been several steps ahead of them. They will never win their &#039;War On Drugs&#039;.

Hackers, as much as governments, deal with this problem when presented with the very question at hand.<br /><br />If #1 or #2 are true, then the solution is simple. This is why the prison system puts gang leaders in special isolation with no outside contact. <br /><br />If they are not, well, this is why al qaeda and the taliban are so hard to put down.<br /><br />If #3 is true, then they&#039;d have bombed us already and blamed it on someone else.<br /><br />And, last but not least:<br /><br />Since #4 is true, we will never die. We will never go away.<br /><br />Beating my chest for the movement aside, lets examine some facts.<br /><br />We are a mostly non-hostile, non-violent group that causes no harm except in the eyes of the Baby Boomer government.<br /><br />We operate wholely on TOR, a CIA invention. TOR&#039;s use for the CIA is two fold: its existence gives terrorists (and CP and other fucktard criminals) the belief they are safe in the anonymous environment. Heavy use, masks the existence of the CIA, sitting there to catch those stupid criminals that they SHOULD be catching.<br /><br />We are a core component to TOR&#039;s existence. We make it work. Our presence here, the more that visit us, only makes TOR a better system. We are not pablo escobar. We are not manuel noriega. We are not mounting an army and storming the whitehouse. We are not planning embassy bombs. We are getting high, and talking like idiots on a forum from our chairs. That is hardly a priority for the already slashed budget.<br /><br />The DEA and the CIA do not like eachother. Fortunately, the CIA has been dealing drugs without the DEA&#039;s consent for the past 80 years. You are probably buying some of it right now, or have today. It&#039;s ok. You&#039;re helping your country. It&#039;s better than donating.<br /><br />The DEA and the FBI on the other hand, were selling tagged guns to the cartels across the boarder, in person. They then lost those weapons. This is not a good indication of a well organized, successful effort against what should have been a SIMPLE undertaking. The NSA and the CIA have all the budgets now, and the DEA and the FBI are out getting caught with hookers, and they&#039;re still not out of the hot water over the whole guns thing.<br /><br />But, of course, we have a conspiracy theory at every turn. Look, it costs a lot of money to organize a sting operation, especially one over a network that is basically anonymous. To do so, they&#039;d have to go through a great effort to not only identify you, but to prove that identity, and then prove that acting upon that is of value after spending all that fucking money to do the first part. Don&#039;t forget, the second part costs money too. Then, they actually have to ACT upon that action that they&#039;ve now approved. Which, after paying for the approval, and bribing a few other officials to make sure the approval doesn&#039;t get leaked, and then of course paying the press to not leak it either so we don&#039;t catch wind of it, they then have to actually pay the agents to go do it.<br /><br />Yes, there are some people on here that probably would fit the receipt on that bill. They&#039;re in the CIA. Go back a few points, and circle back each time until you get the point.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br />A lot of people dont know that the CIA are big drug dealers, good to see people putting out the word

Perhaps some of the posters are/were out of touch with the real world, whilst others had a vested interest in shouting down anyone warning that SR did not have a charmed life. However a more likely explanation lies in the tribal nature of most forums, their dominant absurdities, and the castigation of those who refrain from venerating them.

The amount of drugs sold on SR was miniscule compared to the total drugs traffic, but it was growing fast and international trading links were being formed. Furthermore the increased publicity over the last threee moths had given SR &#039;celebrity&#039; status, and its existence was becoming a political&nbsp; embarrassment.<br /><br />LE does not have the resources to go after all the SR vendors, or rather it is unlikely to withdraw resources away from more serious ongoing drug trading operations (mafia / cartels / biker gangs etc) in order to go after thousands of single vendors, most of whom are selling to end-users and whose activities have temporarily been restricted. There will obviously be some vendors they are interested in more than others, but the amount of work involved and the costs of bringing charges with no certainty of conviction makes the possibility of mass arrests unlikely.<br /><br />Obviously LE will keep all the info they have gathered, and in their own time go through it, file it, cross-ref it, and pass it on to others where appropriate. However my feeling is that the FBI have ticked this job off as done, and are just tidying up the loose ends. Whether local LE act upon info received will be up to them of course, but it looks like the only arrests so far have been of vendors who provided return addresses, and in the case of PlutoPete the UK cops seem to be clutching at straws.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I&#039;m assuming that I&#039;m wrong about this, and that all the suggested security precautions being recommended in other threads should be done as soon as possible :)
