				When logged in on Silk Road, click &quot;account&quot; (top of the page). Then on the right of the page, you&#039;ll find a link saying &quot;become a seller&quot;.<br /><br />

It really worries me that we have people attempting to sell here who can&#039;t even figure out the most basic things. I mean if they can&#039;t even find a link on the Account section of Silk Road (the most logical place to look, right?), how will they manage to wrap their heads around basic security procedures and secure deletion of their customer&#039;s information?! I&#039;d imagine most of these vendors are taking their customer&#039;s addresses, lashing them into a .txt file (or possibly MS Word&nbsp; :o) and saving them on the desktop on their unencrypted computers &#039;til they&#039;re done with them. Then they put them in the Recycle Bin, hit &quot;Empty the Recycle Bin&quot; and sit back thinking &quot;check me out being all fancy and technologically secure - the Recycle Bin: offering military grade deletion since the advent of the Gateway 2000, right? No? Oh.. Oh well, it&#039;ll do for me!&quot; My soul dies a little every time I see one of these threads.<br /><br />The process for vending has been made incredibly simple over the past year, particularly in the last few months - including guides on the Wiki etc. - and these people are STILL having problems. It would be funny if it weren&#039;t so absurd!&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53426.msg522827#msg522827">Quote from: Limetless on October 14, 2012, 11:04 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53426.msg522681#msg522681">Quote from: grahamgreene on October 14, 2012, 09:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">...

I think I noticed it after about 2 seconds, possibly 3, when it was put where it is now. I&#039;d imagine that most new users find it within 10 - 15 seconds though.<br /><br />As for purportedly spending an hour &quot;scouring the forums&quot;, you must search very, veeeerrrrrryyyyyyy slowly. There was a thread literally within the past 12 hours asking for the same information.<br /><br />The Search function in the top right hand corner of the page will also help you find any instructions you need in a matter of seconds. It&#039;s quite revolutionary. I believe a company called &#039;Joogle&#039;, or possibly &#039;Google&#039; - it could be a hard &quot;G&quot; - are running a project right now that will allow you to search something called the World Wide Web; I know, I know, it sounds INSANE but I swear it&#039;s real! A similar system is put in place on things called &#039;vrums&#039; or possibly &#039;forums&#039;, I&#039;m still not quite sure which, that allows you to search for any information that you might require from that &#039;web site&#039;.

I have done plenty of research and read every article I&#039;ve found. Looked for the best exchangers and reviewed multiple wallets. I&#039;m going to go struggle my way thru my PGP key now cos I&#039;m a stupid noob who doesn&#039;t deserve help getting started grrrr.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not a &#039;druggie&#039; myself, so I suppose I&#039;m allowed to be mean because I&#039;m a stiff. I do run a drug cartel though. It&#039;s very small, and entirely powerless, but I&#039;m working on it!<br /><br />Search works perfectly. For instance, searching the term &quot;becoming vendor&quot; throws up 12 pages of results, though I&#039;ll admit not all the results are relevant. However, on the first page alone there are 3 pertinent topics; one with no replies to it, and two - which I have linked below - with the information you were looking for:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21699.msg222507#msg222507<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=48633.msg506668#msg506668<br /><br />Go try using the Search function before telling me it doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t jump to any conclusions, I used the evidence presented by you to make the logical presumption that if you can&#039;t figure out the most basic aspect of vending here - that is, the act of actually becoming a vendor - then you&#039;re probably not cut out for vending. There is a distinct difference between jumping to conclusions about someone - an act which is usually based entirely on hearsay or rumour - and making a logical presumption based on the evidence presented by the person in question.<br /><br />I should also point out that I don&#039;t &quot;jump to conclusions that everybody who is new is a retard&quot;. There are many, many new people here - both buyers and sellers - that don&#039;t require someone to hold their hand throughout the respective processes of buying and selling.<br /><br />I commend you for the research that you&#039;ve done thus far, but it is apparent that you need to a good deal more before you start vending. Have you developed a secure &#039;cashing out&#039; system, for instance? If you need help with understanding how PGP works, Pine very kindly runs the PGP Club to help people get their heads around it; you&#039;ll find that thread here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.0<br /><br />One of the threads I posted above (help becoming cannabis vendor) actually has a great deal of informative links in it that should help you further. I&#039;m not an asshole, though I may have come across as one in this thread. I simply cannot abide people that will inevitably put members of this community at risk.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br />

				This thread is... hilarious... and sad. ???<br />When we became a vendor, we literally had 0 questions on how to go about it. It troubles me to think people have this much difficulty doing anything in their daily lives... <br />.Hades.<br /><br />P.S. Also, new vendors out there, read the thread below. The first page has some epic information for you:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39346.0
