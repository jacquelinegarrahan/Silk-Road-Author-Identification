				Just wanted to get a discussion going on this. So far I am extremely happy with our mods. DPR and staff have done a great job picking people who are seemingly educated, unbiased, and ever present - probably the 3 most important characteristics for a moderator.<br /><br />Now, it got me thinking, how did he find them? In other words, I&#039;m curious if the current mods were approached by DPR or if they approached him. I&#039;m also curious to know what the plans are for the future. As SR continues to grow, will more mods be added? <br /><br />The whole behind the scenes part of SR is really interesting. I wonder how many people work in the resolution center. I wonder how much they get paid, if anything.<br /><br />Its gotta be hard to run a black market... anyone with knowledge (looking at you, mods) care to share some of the inner workings of the Road?

It really means a lot when we see other community members express their support for us! :)<br /><br />I wish I could answer some of your questions! However, as you can probably imagine, DPR likes to play their cards close to their chest - and with very good reason. Site security is paramount to protecting the freedom that Silk Road has returned to us by breaking the shackles of government regulation. Discussing that security with others would likely not be in the site&#039;s best interest. This forum needs Silk Road, and Silk Road needs this forum; the latter evolved from the former, and they have now both evolved yet again to their current state - a community - whereby they enjoy an amazing symbiotic relationship. Our ever-growing community is, in my opinion, the first real step that a mass of people have taken on the journey to winning back personal freedom from government interference in generations.<br /><br />Regarding the site itself, the only inner working of the Road that I can share with you is that I cannot share any inner workings of the Road. :P<br /><br />I&#039;m not 100% sure how many - if any - of the questions above DPR would like us to answer, and were we to answer them we could not be sure if we are giving 100% correct information, as in a number of cases, DPR is the only one privy to such information. That is how it should be, and that is how it needs to be if our community is to be able to continue to grow, and continue stoking the embers of the fires of freedom that burn inside each and every one of us as a result.<br /><br />Needless to say the crew do an incredible job at keeping the good ship Silk Road sailing through waters that are often fraught with danger. Where she&#039;ll end up, nobody knows, but it doesn&#039;t always matter how sturdy a ship you&#039;ve got for the journey ahead of you - with the right crew you can traverse waters and frontiers that you never imagined possible. The fact that we have a sturdy ship, the right crew, and a community that supports her wherever she goes, well.. the possibilities are endless!<br /><br />Libertas

I could only wish. <br /><br />The reason I ask is because of two things:<br /><br />1. I&#039;ve seen a lot of obvious scams recently. Like The Top Shelf, TheGreenXChange (still ongoing I think) and others which I feel could have been stopped earlier than they were. I don&#039;t know how much proof the SR staff looks for before they decide to ban someone or if they just had so much on their plate that things like this slip through the cracks for so long but I feel like there could be some improvement in this field. Obviously you guys can only do so much to stop people from FEing but at a certain point its necessary to step in, and I feel that should have been done earlier in many situations.<br /><br />I guess another question is, in a case like the most recent scam, TheGreenXchange, how long/how many non arriving FE does it take before the vendor is suspended? Maybe the system needs to be redesigned with keeping in mind that FE is a reality and people will do it. Some type of FE counter system, I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m just thinking out loud.<br /><br />2. The 2nd reason I&#039;m curious about the inner workings about SR is because I want to know how I can take a more active role in preventing people from getting scammed here. In a case like TheTopShelf, TheGreenXchange and I&#039;m sure others in the past, people (including myself) had been saying for days there was a scam occurring before anything was done to stop it. How can I make sure that next time it stops right away?<br /><br />The forums run much better than the site. The site has so many scams it sickens me sometimes. The other thing which I think needs to be revised is the selling of vendor accounts. If the bond is reimbursable then the only reason for someone to buy an existing account is to dupe people into trusting the stats of the account which were not genuinely earned, but rather bought. If an account is sold the stats should be reset. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how this turned into a rant, lol. Still an appreciation thread, but a constructive appreciation thread I suppose :)<br /><br />

				To respond to the OP as Libertas has already stated we can&#039;t divulge anything, we are hunted people and we have to protect our anonymity at all costs, any information regarding how SR works will only ever come from DPR.<br /><br />If you want to help with possible scammers then pm the mods with the names of those who are engaging in suspicious behavior or outright rule breaking. We are pretty good at spotting who needs extra attention but the more the community looks out for itself the better. i have actually been really encouraged of late by how vigilant some people are becoming, there are still a lot of people who love to FE for vendors clearly in the mid flight with an FE scam but I can only assume those people do not come to the forums to research their vendor choices before ordering.

				Hey To the OP you should check this out, a good example of the forum members doing there part to get action taken and ban a scammer<br />a new post was started to get the Mods attention, its now 15 hours later and I cant go to the vendors page so Hes been banned already and who knows how long for already, but This is what I like to see.<br /><br />Check it out<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162189.0<br /><br />We need more of this, lots more, everyone should be on the lookout and do there part to bring these asswipes to the attention of those with pull.<br /><br />

So far I am extremely happy with our mods. DPR and staff have done a great job picking people who are seemingly educated, unbiased, and ever present - probably the 3 most important characteristics for a moderator.<br /><br />Now, it got me thinking, how did he find them? In other words, I&#039;m curious if the current mods were approached by DPR or if they approached him. I&#039;m also curious to know what the plans are for the future. As SR continues to grow, will more mods be added? <br /><br />The whole behind the scenes part of SR is really interesting. I wonder how many people work in the resolution center. I wonder how much they get paid, if anything.<br /><br />Its gotta be hard to run a black market... anyone with knowledge (looking at you, mods) care to share some of the inner workings of the Road?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> This forum needs Silk Road, and Silk Road needs this forum; the latter evolved from the former, and they have now both evolved yet again to their current state - a community - whereby they enjoy an amazing symbiotic relationship.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have been here for five months and only started reading the forum Silk Road was offline. I did that to be reassured that my bitcoins&nbsp; =and SilkRoad were not gone. <br />The fifty posts rule kept me away from posting. Most customer might read the forum from time to time but very post or have the patience to post fifty threads in the useless area. Finally I broke free from the newbie jailhouse.

				Great thread!<br /><br />...sorry i have nothing to contribute&nbsp; :P<br /><br />as i am not a mod or admin etc. <br /><br />But this is a badass online mafia that runs the world and all its secrets are secret for good reason and will never be discussed on here <br />there are many things mods and people who work for SR don&#039;t even know. This place is too cool :) ;) 8) :-X
