				hello folks first off i&#039;d like to apologise in advance if these questions have been answered elsewhere, i&#039;ve tried to look for the answers but the slowness for me of the forums has made it difficult<br /><br />with that out of the way my first major question would be how many bitcoins do you need to become a seller ? the only answer i could find is 150 which i&#039;m not sure is a joke answer or not ha.<br /><br />second question is i have a line to legal highs which i get for free or next to nothing, but some are the brand name (gogaine, bullet, doob etc.) which are composites of various legal chemicals, would i get into trouble listing them in the wrong category ?<br /><br />also as i&#039;m a new member and have no feedback i want to list some of my stuff where the first order to come along would be a freebie (or in some cases more, i&#039;ve got this stuff called naphyrone which was banned in the UK so my mate give me 500g of it, so say the first 5 people would get a g free) could i get bad reviews because, say due to a high volume of demand, i had to turn people away ?<br /><br />and last but not least, i was thinking of doing free postage to people in the UK (its cost of a stamp after all) but charge people in other countries, are you allowed to do this or is it just organised with the seller ?<br /><br />thanks in advance :)<br /><br />--------------------------<br />edit: I&#039;m adding this here in case anyone reading it would have a seller account they would be willing to part with the right money but you are worried about my competency/ligitimacy<br />i&#039;ve spent some time looking at the other forums and realized that the exposure which brought me here has brought a lot of potential scammers and users who aren&#039;t..paranoid enough ? but not in the bad way<br /><br />i&#039;ve read and understood this article http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road and the account will be used in a vmware shell running linux thats stored on an encrypted partition on my computer that utilizes both a password and a key, with a dummy key-only part stored with loads of old porn pictures

				Hey, calm down. There&#039;s no need to be nervous. The mods here aren&#039;t heavy on the banhammer.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the price of a seller account, since I&#039;m not interested in selling. I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be as high as 150 bitcoins, though. Maybe it was 150 dollars? Though all transactions in SR are made in bitcoins, prices are usually listed in US dollars since bitcoins fluctuate so much.<br /><br />You won&#039;t get in trouble for listing things in the wrong category, but it&#039;ll make it harder for potential customers to find your products, so it&#039;s better to be careful when making your listings.<br /><br />You can make custom listings for free products and advertise them as limited deals. This is common practice and won&#039;t get you negative feedback. Just be polite and send people a message explaining why you cancelled their orders - also be sure to remove the free listing quickly once you&#039;re out of free samples, to avoid confusion.<br /><br />Finally, it is possible to specify multiple shipping options at different prices in your listings. You can have a free option for UK clients and a paid one for foreign clients, no problem.<br /><br />I hope I was helpful. Welcome to SR!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Horizons.

				haha i&#039;m always nervous about asking questions like this because a lot of places don&#039;t tolerate stuff that has already been answered, and this being such a none-newbie friendly place (as in the sense of how hard it is to find and the knowledge needed to get here, not in the sense you guys aren&#039;t friendly) i wasn&#039;t sure so better to grovel ;)<br /><br />i did some reading on the net and found out why you guys don&#039;t have free seller accounts anymore that is seriously messed up, it did say people would auction them off<br /><br />got another few questions too - if it was $150 would that be the amount needed in my account before getting 1 or would that money then be lost ? problem is at the moment i am incredibly poor, i did my back in and had to quit my job<br /><br />are there any rules on asking other people to sell stuff for you ? although would anyone be crazy enough to go for that anyway, risk your reputation on some random person haha<br /><br />o and 1 more thing, these forums are really hard to get on for me, they only work every few hours, other times they time out, is this usual because of the nature of the site and lack of bandwidth ? i don&#039;t use tor for any other purpose so i can&#039;t test if it&#039;s a tor thing<br /><br />

				Haha, no problem. You can feel at home asking questions here, several users will be glad to help if they can.<br /><br />The money is &quot;lost&quot; - you&#039;re buying a seller account, after all. This fee is in place partly to prevent what would otherwise be a huge influx of scammer sellers offering bunk or non-existant products to try and make a quick buck at the expense of the buyers.<br /><br />There aren&#039;t any trusted middleman services here who could sell your product for you. One kid (and I do mean kid, as in &quot;not yet out of high school&quot;) tried setting one up, and may try again under a different account name. I wouldn&#039;t trust anyone offering such a service, though. You can never be sure that they aren&#039;t out to scam both you and your customers, or that they aren&#039;t working with Law enforcement. From the buyer&#039;s point of view, the fact that both the middleman and the actual salesman get to see their address is also a huge risk. So all in all I think it isn&#039;t a very good idea.<br /><br />The Tor network is very slow compared to the regular Internet (which we call the clearnet, to distinguish it from hidden services). If you find that you can&#039;t connect to a website, try clicking the &quot;Use a New Identity&quot; button in Vidalia. If it still doesn&#039;t work, the only thing you can do is wait. If you find yourself clicking that button more than once every ten minutes, chances are your problem won&#039;t be fixed that way.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Horizons.

				ah awesome that&#039;s everything cleared up<br /><br />i&#039;ll try that new ID thing when it goes slow, it&#039;s fine at the moment (the 1 time you want something to not work, sod&#039;s law eh)<br />i&#039;m fixing a few PCs over the weekend so hopefully that&#039;ll get me enough together to buy a seller account<br /><br />i&#039;m working with a friend so i&#039;m sure between us we&#039;ll get enough to buy one..if not i&#039;ll have to sell the missus :P

				imo legal highs will not sell, so before you buy a sellers account, post in the product offers forum to gauge some sort of interest.<br />They do sell when nobody else really has no other option, which SR has plenty of.<br />My 2c, but I would love to be proven wrong<br /><br />Good luck ;)<br />

				this is also posted in first post so you can skip over:<br />-----------------------------------<br />i&#039;ve had a look round and because i just seen the main page and the offers from high sellers, and because when i came to this it was because it was from a tv show where someone bought illegal drugs safely and encrypted, i didn&#039;t put enough research into the sellers you don&#039;t see on the front page, and of course the potential scam buyers<br /><br />i&#039;ve read and understood this article http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road and the account will be used in a vmware shell running linux thats stored on an encrypted partition on my computer that utilizes both a password and a key, with a dummy key-only part stored with loads of old porn pictures<br /><br />---------------------------------<br /><br />and i think its time for my bed! my brain is fried, i&#039;ve focused so hard on trying to do this right (had a lot of stuff go wrong lately that was promising so i&#039;m due a good turn hehe)<br /><br /><br />PO boxes are pretty secure aren&#039;t they ? if someone has a PO box or an anonymous address not tied to them in any way i&#039;ll send 1g of naphyrone to it so at least 1 person can give me a lil boost without any danger to them<br />this is the wiki link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphyrone<br />i personally don&#039;t like it, i like to snort stuff and the taste makes me heave, but my gf didn&#039;t mind the taste. its quite a clear high, its hard to explain it loosens you up, euphoria and complacency. its good for long sex/foreplay like E but without the hardcore mong/buzz<br /><br />comedown is hard to say, it kinda just...stops working. afterwards you can&#039;t sleep but you don&#039;t feel all groggy or sore. i&#039;ve only took it indoors it didn&#039;t seem like a club drug but each to their own<br /><br />right i&#039;m done i&#039;m waffling so much..don&#039;t mix morphine coffee and irn bru, if i overthink anything else i&#039;m gonna start predicting the future :P<br /><br />-------<br /><br />reply to novocaine posted while i was typing this novel<br /><br />well i&#039;ve got lots of spare stuff floating about and my scrips for painkillers amonst other stuff, but yeah i&#039;ll find out interest first :)
