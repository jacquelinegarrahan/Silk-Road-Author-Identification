				Is this truly a coincidence?<br /><br />I don&#039;t have an answer.&nbsp; I think it is a very interesting question.<br /><br />I appreciate this is sprinkled to some extent throughout other threads, but would appreciate some of the more elite brains here weighing in on the question.&nbsp; <br /><br />This means speculation is encouraged and the name of the game.&nbsp; No need for proof/evidence/etc.&nbsp; Just thinking/talking it out.<br /><br />VERY interesting timing to my eyes.

				I think its just a coincidence. The timing of the arrest / shutdown was determined by the evidence they had an so on. The US Gov made no secret of the fact that the LE and public safety agencies would continue to get funding while thousands of other Govt workers went without paychecks.

I think they&#039;re completely unrelated.<br /><br />That said, if your theory is that they busted him now to keep him in custody longer and thus make him suffer, then maybe. I guess.<br /><br />The US Federal court system only had enough funds to stay open for approximately 10 days, so he might end up in custody longer; but the federal trial process is so fucking slow that it won&#039;t make much difference. He&#039;s going to be in custody for years before there&#039;s a verdict; that&#039;s if this goes to trial.<br /><br />I did not visit this site, but if you search for the information on startpage, you can see that as of October 2, that&#039;s what the courts are saying:<br />news.uscourts.gov/judiciary-open-during-government-shutdown
