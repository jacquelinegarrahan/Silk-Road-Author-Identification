				UPDATE (1912 UTC 11/26/2012): We&#039;ve gone through the first step in our anti-ddos procedure and reopened the site to see if it was enough.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be monitoring the situation until I am confident the site is stable.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience.<br /><br />I&#039;ve closed the site because it appears to be under a DDoS attack.&nbsp; The initial survey of the situation appears this way.&nbsp; I will keep you updated here.&nbsp; We have a plan in place to mitigate this and are going through the steps to execute this plan.

				As far as I know this is the first time admins have admitted to a possible attack of ANY kind. I wonder what this means about the severity of the problem this time, if anything. I mean, if there had been this type of problems before, and they never announced anything, but this time they did, well draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />And the most likely culprit is obvious: LE.<br /><br />

				Another grateful member here.<br /><br />After &quot;Tired of this BS&quot; thread disappeared. I&#039;m glad I clicked on SR Discussion Thread and saw Dread Pirate Roberts on top of it. <br /><br />Those with some experience and common sense know you are sincere. I was getting ready to pounce on that &quot;BS&quot; numbskull. The fact that he can figure out how to get online, let alone deal with bitcoins, runs contrary to his ALL CAPS tirade. <br /><br />I&#039;m a former equipment installer of servers. No IT expert. Just a basic understanding. - I think it&#039;s a simple bottleneck. It&#039;s Monday morning across the USA. I&#039;ve been on and off since 7am EST (12pm UTC), and it was starting to get a little slow. <br /><br />Then take into account, people waiting for deliveries. My mail came at 10am my time. I was happy to find 2 orders in my mailbox. They were both late, and Sunday (no mail delivery)&nbsp; I was busy with Resolution on them. So I couldn&#039;t wait to jump back on SR to give FB, apologize to one seller for accusing him of being a scammer, and then go on the forums to exonerate him.<br /><br />Now, multiply my NEED to get on SR, by how ever many buyers were waiting for their mail to come. <br /><br />Think how many DIDN&#039;T get their order, and were giving it till Monday.<br /><br />Then those who simply got theirs and wanted to leave FB.<br /><br />As the clock goes 6am to 12pm, think of the time zones too. There are 5 in the US. 4 are major. So with every hour that passes, each zone gets to that time when mail is delivered. Granted some areas don&#039;t get their mail until late afternoon. <br /><br />I actually expected to have trouble logging on today, and was surprised I was on as long as I was. <br /><br />I hope Dread is reading this. Remember how you explained the &quot;bottleneck&quot; after the big outtage, and SR came back online, only to go down again?<br /><br />Unless there is something you can see that is telling you it&#039;s a DDoS,&nbsp; I thought I&#039;d offer my insight. I learned a lot about how internet traffic flows through servers. I was a part of the FIOS installation at the main hub of telecommunications for the Northeast US. So a bottleneck, or simple &quot;overload&quot; - seems very plausible. <br /><br />Anyway., that&#039;s just my two cents. <br /><br />The whole world is awake right now. By 10pm EST (3:00am UTC)&nbsp; When my friends across the Atlantic are all snuggled in their beds.&nbsp; It always seems to get real fast and smooth for me. It also makes perfect sense. <br /><br />Just my two cents. <br /><br />Thanks for everything!

				Suggestions -<br /><br />Ban IP Range of DDOS Temporarily<br />Use separate severs for login and the site - Opens vulnerability to other attacks which you must then secure but would prevent a DDOS attack. If it were attempted the DDOS&#039;ing members could be blocked or restrictions on connections for new members could be set.

				Nah wouldn&#039;t take a very serious attack to do it. I mean look at it this way, SR gets slowed down to a snailpace just from a busy period of activity sometimes and a ddos would be larger. I just think that most people who would be inclined to do such a thing also respect the fact that DPR is not an idiot and probably not the smartest choice to take on in this kind of war and that&#039;s why we don&#039;t see frequent ddos.

If you go to a site, then close the tab, then go back to the site, TorBrowser loads a cached version and you still need to reload the page. This is not how normal browsers work, and I thought maybe that&#039;s why you were still seeing the maintenance page.

				DDos was only an assumption. If you read my other posts, I explain server overload, and Monday morning, how across Europe and then the US, people are checking their mail, getting on to leave FB, <br /><br />Or complain,. Take into account &quot;Cyber Monday&quot; - Servers are shared, bandwith is shared. I installed some of the main servers (FIOS) for the financial distict (Wall St) after 9-11, Verizon may say you have a dedicated server, but you really don/t <br /><br />It was just a bottleneck, it was back up as I predicted. <br /><br />So what? So the site goes down for a few hours. Go do something else, and come back later. <br /><br />A lot of people on here need to buy some Valium or bud or whatever does it for you, and chill out!!e

				Was it ever verified that it was indeed a DDoS? - I only saw that it was suspected. My own theory was simple server overload. <br />It was cyber-monday. Some shopping sites were overloaded too. Big companies would rather claim a DDoS, than admit they don&#039;t pay for enough servers to handle the overload. <br /><br />I used to install FIOS servers in Manhattan, and a majority of internet traffic goes through there. It&#039;s a huge hub for not just the Northeast US corridor, but international traffic as well. <br /><br />That was over 5 years ago, I&#039;ve heard since I retired, that they really changed the way they share servers. Like anything goes. A Wall St firm might be guaranteed a certain amount of dedicated servers from say 6a to 6p. Then it drops to 50% as the servers are shared with other companies, or used as overflow for companies experiencing a high logon volume.<br /><br />Just a theory of mine. I don&#039;t claim to be an IT pro. I was just an&nbsp; equipment installer, but did learn quite a bit just from working with IT people. <br /><br />Food for thought. Might not have ever been a DDoS. - there is that possibility.&nbsp;
