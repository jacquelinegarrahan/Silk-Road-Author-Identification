				lmao....<br /><br />your thread didn&#039;t get any real answers, though! i tried averaging the 24 hour high and low, but that comes out to be 29.34. p/btc. value is still dropping on SR, yet it&#039;s been dancing between 29.5 and 30 on mtgox for hours! It&#039;s literally hours behind...

				It&#039;s because SR, like BMR, just takes snapshots at different times of the day and applies the then-current exchange rate until the next snapshot.&nbsp; Mt. Gox, like Bitfloor, is a bona fide exchange service, so you get real-time trading data, which is necessary for trading but not so much for the marketplace.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s no different than if you traveled to another country (say, Qatar), where your USD that morning are worth 3.14 Qatari dinar.&nbsp; So, you go to the mall, and you&#039;ll find that every single salesperson known the day&#039;s exchange rate.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty cool to see.&nbsp; Anyway, sometime during the day, your USD become worth 3.16 dinar, but you&#039;re not likely to notice.&nbsp; And, you&#039;re not likely to get the better exchange rate from anywhere except perhaps an ATM.<br /><br />There&#039;s no reason to expect SR to have up-to-the-second exchange rate data, although it&#039;d be nice.&nbsp;

So, I don&#039;t think it is a matter of &#039;SR&#039;s price was correct this morning but may be off later in the day as it is still set to the morning snapshot&#039;. I have a feeling the OP has a valid question/point. I am not too worried about it being off by a bit from current rates. I just think it would be good if the way it is determined (for SR&#039;s valuation) was well known to everyone who cared. It may be in the &quot;Buyer&#039;s Guide&quot; or someplace easy to access, so maybe I am just poorly informed due to lack of research? I think SR may use the low end of a range of possible valuation methods intentionally for some good reason or other?<br />NWN

				o, yeah, a little more transparency would go a long way.&nbsp; On the other hand, they call it the &quot;black market&quot; for a reason or two.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; SE2&nbsp; I had to quote you on this. You crack me up with the sarcasm and realism. We spend so much time and effort to be &quot;a nano&quot; with everything we do here and around here it just cracks me up to read the word &quot;transparency&quot;, but I understand we are speaking of money being spent and damn it they should be transparent.. Lol<br />SE2 your the best....Well maybe 2nd to Scout..haha<br />

				I believe SR uses the 24 hour simple moving average.&nbsp; Not sure how frequently it&#039;s updated.&nbsp; <br /><br />A moving average serves as a smoothing mechanism, which tends to smooth out price fluctuations -- i.e. it makes the price less volatile.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice feature, because it minimizes large price swings in the short term, which is makes things more predictable, particularly for the buyer.&nbsp; No one likes it when a large negative market price swing causes them to be a few bit cents short when it&#039;s time to make the big purchase.
