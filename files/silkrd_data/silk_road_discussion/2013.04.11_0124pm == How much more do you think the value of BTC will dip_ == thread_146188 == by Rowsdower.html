				I have some bitcoins I&#039;d like to place an order with, but thanks to bitcoin losing so much value over the last few days at the moment I am cutting it close and am only about .03 bitcoins away from not being able to order what I want anymore.&nbsp; How low do you guys think the value of BTC will go? I worry that if I send the coins to my SR wallet now the value will have dropped low enough by the time the transaction is confirmed that I may no longer be able to purchase what I want.&nbsp; It seems to still be dropping.&nbsp; Should I buy whatever I can now with the bitcoin or wait til the weekend or next week to order anything?<br /><br />Edit : Holy crap!&nbsp; Just while writing this post it fell by almost another 20 bucks.&nbsp; Definitely have the feeling now that if I send over coins I won&#039;t be able to order what I want by the time they get to the SR wallet.

				I think it&#039;ll probably go down to 150 or so then slowly climb back up to $200. I don&#039;t see it rising as fast as it was before since so many people are scared now.

				It&#039;s depressing how every time I press refresh on MtGox now, the value keeps dropping like a rock.&nbsp; At this rate I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if next week all I can get is a gram of soapbar for 100 bitcoins.

				I didn&#039;t buy them recently at all so overall I&#039;m not hurting as bad as maybe if I&#039;d got them this week or last week, but of course it&#039;s a shame seeing them lose value so drastically after the recent (seemingly temporary) increase in value.&nbsp; I just went ahead and sent some coins to my SR wallet for the order, now hopefully the confirmations will roll in fast and I can place it,and also hopefully the vendor will accept it and not just cancel the order and pull listings given the bitcoin situation at the moment.

				I just hope it doesn&#039;t drop anymore within the next 48 hours. I just purchased more coins all I wanted to do is place my order. I still have enough but if it drops anymore then I&#039;ll have to go get more coins and essentially cause me to have to wait even longer before I can place my purchase&nbsp; &gt;:(.

				Yeah man I&#039;ve been watching close, I still couldn&#039;t believe my eyes I was just as shocked to see it go down to $120 as I was when I seen it up by $200 lol but it looks like it&#039;s been staying at $120 for a while now. I hope that bitcoin stabilizes soon, it&#039;s fun to watch funds grow but it sucks when it drops. All of this bitcoin craziness is getting in the way of the main goal which is to be able to buy what I need comfortably and consistently.

				I would stay away from any trades at this point, unless you&#039;re a thrill-seeker&nbsp; Too much manipulation. Wait till the volatility subsides and the price levels. I&#039;m thinking BTC will get very good support at the $35-$45 range. Load up then and wait for the next big wave.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
