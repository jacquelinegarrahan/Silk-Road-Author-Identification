				1) Buyers finalize, leaving their rating for you.<br /><br />2) Then in order to actually leave a review, head to your account settings.<br /><br />3) Click on Recent Orders, and then the Post Review button.<br /><br />4) From there you can leave your feedback and then you should be good to go.<br /><br />**For the time being, neither the rating or review/feedback can be edited after clicking confirm.**<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone that is confused or simply hasn&#039;t grasped the changes yet.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Vanquish

				Maybe you would want to write guides about topics you know about, for everyone&#039;s sake.<br /><br />You cannot edit the feedback/score. So you buy, finalize and leave feedback, that&#039;s it. <br /><br />BTW the new system is shite.<br /><br />Peace out.<br />Jason

				lol that&#039;s so confusing. I&#039;m sure in a week or two DPR will change it anyway. But thank you for letting me know how to do that.

				you can also just go to the vendors page and &quot;review&quot; will be a link near &quot;message, become a fan, discuss, report&quot; for anyone you&#039;ve recently bought from.&nbsp; So far it&#039;s easiest for me to go to the finalize page, &amp; open a new tab of the vendors profile then so that you can leave your rating &amp; then review in the next tab since after you rate it just goes to the homepage.&nbsp; this is probably not the best way to describe it but I find it easier than having to go to account, orders, etc or searching out the vendor.&nbsp; <br />maybe sending to the review page after leaving the rating instead of going to the homepage would be better. With a warning on the page that it is final &amp; that you do not have to review right away or something like that. could help with the confusion and get more people to write feedback.

				What&#039;s the time limit to leave a review? Same 4 month limit as before? <br /><br />I know that it&#039;s at least 6 weeks since I have an un-reviewed order that&#039;s been on my order page for said length of time.
