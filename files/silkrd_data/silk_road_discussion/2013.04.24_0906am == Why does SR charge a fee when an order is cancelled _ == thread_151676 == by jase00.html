				as per the topic... is it just me or is it unfair you lose a bit of your BTC when an order is cancelled ?<br />It seems a bit greedy to do that.. and if it&#039;s to do with hedging.. I can&#039;t see how that makes sense... for e.g 10 BTC now&nbsp; = 10BTC next week regardless of the $$ price. .. <br />So i can only assume you lose the funds due to fee&#039;s. <br /><br />Like if you order and the vendor wants you to F.E and you refuse... they cancel.. you lose money. Why doesn&#039;t the vendor lose money ? <br />or the vendor runs out of product but didnt update the amount left correctly... they cancel and you lose money.. <br /><br />I really do appreciate the amount of time, effort and risk DPR and the crew puts into SR. The amount of work and secrecy to keep it running is unimaginable... Even a bit of down time here and there is no problems as this is the type of site we could of only dreamed about a few years ago... <br /><br />I&#039;m usually not one to complain about the site, but this is just really the only thing that annoys me.&nbsp; Surely the amount of money the site makes they don&#039;t need to grab every cent they can from us customers :(<br /><br />Again.. love the site and shall continue to use it.. but yeah. <br /><br /><br />

				If a vendor hedges their transactions, the 4% hedging fee is an irreversible charge taken by SR as soon as the order is placed. It sucks when an order is cancelled by no mistake of your own, but that is how it&#039;s done, unfortunately. :(

				Okay maybe I&#039;ve confused myself or had too much fun in the past week. <br /><br />If the seller or buyer cancels not hedged does SR still get commission and what happens when the buyer cancels the order unhedged?<br />
