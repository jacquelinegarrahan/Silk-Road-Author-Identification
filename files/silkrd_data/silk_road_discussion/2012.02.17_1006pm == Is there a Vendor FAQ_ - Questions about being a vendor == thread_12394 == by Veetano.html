				I&#039;m looking to start up a mini-career here on SR and become a vendor with what I have to offer the community.<br /><br />Though, before I get into it and buy a vendor account, there are so many things I am left in the dark about...<br /><br />I understand there are fees per transaction, how do these effect sales, what are the actual fees?<br /><br />How is the Vendor protected? <br />-What happens when a buyer refuses to finalize, even when tracking confirms it was delivered? <br />-What happens if the buyer tries to say it didn&#039;t arrive, or not all of it was there, and refuses to finalize?<br /><br />How can I sell a product and make money to reup if the buyer goes absentee and just doesn&#039;t come back on SR, maybe they thought they finalized and they didn&#039;t, and they dont come back for weeks until they need more, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />The only thing I know, from being a buyer here on SR, is:<br />Vendors can put up there items<br />Vendors can mark an item intransit<br />Vendors can refund buyers<br />Vendors have fees on each transaction.<br /><br />I really want to start selling product on here, but I don&#039;t want any surprises, I want to be able to somewhat accurately predict my earnings(minus the fluctuation of BTC).<br /><br />Also... on a side note for those of you in the US.<br />How easy is it to ship priority boxes? They come with tracking right? Can I just put them in any blue USPS drop off mailbox in most shopping centers around the area?<br /><br />Edit: Obviously this is an extra account I made for my privacy. As a buyer on silkroad I have spent approximately 15,000 USD worth of bitcoins. I&#039;m more than experienced with the buying aspect, but I feel so clueless on the operation of vendors.

				I would also like to know these things...<br /><br />Perhaps some vendors on here can let us know the life of an SR vendor?
