				Help me with what? Gaining your approval? Sorry that this extra post bothers you so much.. Maybe you should learn how to use the search function so that you can find exactly what you were looking for in the first place. Unless you were looking to be unhelpful, well then you&#039;ve come to the right place my friend :)

				Hey, r6991420b, welcome to the world of internet forums. You will learn that there are a lot of elitists on the internet, and many of them will be mean and unhelpful because you are new to this world. This is their world, and you must understand that the senior members are all smarter than you and better than you and they will scoff at you for asking for help. <br /><br />Yes, it sounds stupid, but that&#039;s because it is. You will do well to remember that, it will keep things in perspective. Then, one day you will be a senior member, and you will be experienced in the ways of internet forums, and if in your journey you forget how stupid the elitism is, you too will see how you are better and smarter than all the new guys, and you will scoff at them and tell them to use the search function rather than easily answer their questions, but you will have so much karma and you will feel comfortable in knowing you think exactly like everyone else.<br /><br />Don&#039;t grow up to be like that. Grow up to be an hero. Grow up to help the noobs.<br /><br />Welcome to SR forums, bro. I&#039;d give you positive karma if I could, but I am new too.<br />

				Rule #1 of any internet forum: Search before asking. And if you can&#039;t find your answer, try searching again with different terms. And if you still can&#039;t find your answer, wait a few hours, then try searching again! Only post a new topic as a last resort for learning something. Otherwise you come off as lazy/ignorant, which can turn into negative karma. <br /><br />A seasoned internet forum user can learn everything they want from the forums by only searching and never registering a username (unless the forums require it for searching). <br /><br />If you want to cast off the negative karma you have already received so early in your stay here, you can always register a new username, follow the advice above, and be much more prosperous :)

				Ahh! I understand now! So to receive Karma, you must suck up to people who think they are better than you since they spend more time on the internet.. Oh and of course I must degrade and insult the people who don&#039;t continuously browse the opinions of drug users, and aren&#039;t completely informed about the slight differences that the SR forum has with other forums... I guess you can compare receiving Karma to trying to get a raise at a shitty middle-class job.. I appreciate all of your insightful information and opinions!!&nbsp; :) :)

				The actual way you get + karma is by being positive and helpful. Don&#039;t be a jerk, don&#039;t ask dumb questions, be humble, be genuine, use proper grammar and spelling, don&#039;t transgress against, say, anonymity or any of the other major prerogatives of Tor and SR, etc. You know, like basic people skills in life.
