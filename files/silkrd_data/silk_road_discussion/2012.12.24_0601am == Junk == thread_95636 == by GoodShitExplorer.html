				Things went well for me, I am very happy. This will definitely be a much better Christmas than last year. Silk Road is a magical website and I am very thankful that I found it! It is so much safer buying drugs now and the sources are often more trustworthy then I could find locally. <br /><br />

				Damn right!&nbsp; This has been one of the best years of my life.&nbsp; Silk Road was a great find this year, but had many more great things happen as well.&nbsp; The past coupe were some of the roughest so to come in this year with one of the best almost seems better than it was because of the close comparison of the shitty years.&nbsp; I&#039;m really loving life right now!&nbsp; Merry Christmas to the Road!!!!

				2012 has been a hell of a year. I have stood on a piece of land that few men ever have, I have flown with lovers and swam with monsters. My moral compass was broken, and months were spent repairing it. I have laughed with dangerous friends and cried at the fall of age old enemies. Rolled some gutters and some strikes. I cleared old debts and started some fresh ones. I have seen new life and mourned the loss of old lives. I have had highs I couldn&#039;t before imagine, and lows that seemed unbearable. I am still just as alive as the end of 2011, but somehow feel stronger for having gone through the journeys I took. I wouldn&#039;t give 2012 back for anything and I look forward to an adventure filled 2013.

				I learned that in order for me to be perfectly happy in love I need to have a wife, a girlfriend and a mistress and that if you are a cocky and arrogant enough of a person it is really fun to have them all hang out together. <br /><br />I learned that taking a gram of MDA is a really good way to have a great night and a shitty week.<br /><br />I learned that even as an 8th grade drop out I can do my friend&#039;s (aka wife&#039;s) college homework and consistently get more points than the assignment was worth.<br /><br />I learned that using my fibula to stop an oncoming SUV is likely to result in more damage to my fibula than the SUV.<br /><br />I learned that despite the fact that getting older changes everything it&#039;s actually sort of fun too.<br /><br />I learned that I could make thousands of dollars having my computer play video games for me.<br /><br />I learned that I am a fucked up confused mess of a human being and that everyone else is in pretty much the same boat as I am and we are all just too polite to admit it to one another.

In a nutshell though most MMO&#039;s have in game currencies that many websites will buy an sell. Using macros, virtual machines and botting software it&#039;s possible to script routines that will have your computer play the game and make some virtual money for you while you are gone which you then sell to the external sites. If you typed in WoW gold sale into Google you would see some of the sites that buy and sell the stuff but WoW is so overplayed by folks in China that it&#039;s hard to make money on that particular game. <br /><br />I played SWTOR for a while and made about 5K before my girlfriend thought I was obsessing too much on games and demanded I come cuddle with her instead.

				No disrespect but LOL at discovering SR being an achievement ! To me it&#039;s actually quite the opposite of an achievement, I&#039;m doing a lot more drugs now and achieving less things in real life. Not that it&#039;s necessarily a bad thing but let&#039;s see.
