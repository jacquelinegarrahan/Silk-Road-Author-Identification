				Today several cases were dm in co and wa for mj poss that is legal under the new statute. This means that it is really hear, no mater what the feds do for us users it, legalization is here today. I know longer care about having to use tor to buy mj, my seller still needs it, but no more stress going to pick up my mail anymore, I know that all my friends that thought I was crazy for using sr are all now planning on signing up as soon as they can. I think there will be a flood of mj users on sr because that is what happend to everything else. does anyone go to best buy anymore??? or is it amazon or whatever .com?? i know that i have found some of the best mj anywhere out there on sr and more customers means more sellers and more options for all of us. <br /><br />

				Increased demand sounds like the exact opposite of what will happen. Why would anyone want to pay contraband prices on the internet and risk the feds getting involved when they can just go to their corner store and legally buy it for what will most likely be much cheaper than street price?<br /><br />Most likely what will happen is people living in those states will do exactly that which translates to less customers for SR. The licensed vendors in those states will probably try to peddle their goods on the side on SR for more than what they will get selling it legally, and tax free to boot. Reduced demand and increased supply means SR prices will most likely drop, though I&#039;m not sure what will happen with the parity between SR prices and street prices - local dealers and buyers outside of those states will not see a change in the supply and demand. Most likely there will be a disparity between SR prices and street prices initially, and then the prices will be brought back to parity by enterprising individuals purchasing the goods for cheap on SR and dealing it locally.

				I can&#039;t see two states being able to change the demand of a product globally. Maybe I&#039;m wrong though.

				one thing is certain: those states will increase number of their postal inspectors. Maybe to the point when every single package coming out of CO and WA is xrayed or something.

				the cases being dm before the law is in effect, cases that did not have to be dm.<br /><br />my point is that we have real legalization for users in two us states right now. <br /><br />sr will be popular because it will take over a year just to write the regs for the new systems in both states.<br /><br />there has not been anything said about challenging legalization by in state authorities, unlike places like flint where the police have said they will ignore city decriminalization votes and arrest under state law instead.<br /><br />if the co or wa leadership wanted to ignore the law they could, they could cross license (ie make them both federal and state peace officers) ask for extra money for enforcement and make it much harder. <br /><br />it is very big that the law enforcement and leadership inside the states has accepted the vote and will not work against it.
