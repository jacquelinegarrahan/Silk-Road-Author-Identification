				ya know the carnival game?&nbsp; whack one mole and two more pop up!&nbsp; seems to be happening that way with the bugs on Silk Road the past few days.&nbsp; I think we&#039;ve fixed the random logout bug, but now we are getting reports of some people being unable to access the site at all for brief periods, being presented only with an error message.&nbsp; Well, we&#039;re aware of this one too and will get it fixed asap.&nbsp; Hopefully another won&#039;t pop up when we do!

				ok, I&#039;ve made a change that will hopefully fix the problem we say earlier.&nbsp; Had to log everyone out a couple of times, but we should be good to go right now.&nbsp; If for some reason you are getting an error when trying to access the site at the moment, try restarting your browser.

				Came on here just now to say I&#039;d been logged out again, but I see now that you&#039;re the one that logged us out! Sneaky.<br /><br />Anyways, thanks for staying on top of the bugs! I will be on the lookout for any stray errors.

				I noticed what I thought was a weird glitch earlier with something in my shopping cart. I was sure of the dollar value calculated from BTC by the site, however, the total price with the only shipping option available selected showed a price about $8.00 higher all of sudden. My first thought was that it was an unhedged listing, and BTC had also risen somewhat rapidly. This was not the case, it was hedged, and a quick refresh of the shopping cart made the original and expected price return. Just thought I would add that in case no one else did/other people saw something like this as well. Take care everybody.
