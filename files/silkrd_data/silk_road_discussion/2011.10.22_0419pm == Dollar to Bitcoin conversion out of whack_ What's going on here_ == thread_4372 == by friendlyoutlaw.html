				I&#039;m trying to purchase weed from Rook.<br /><br />If I look at his costs with the units set to dollars, it&#039;s $12...which is exactly what he says it would cost, in his description (it&#039;s one of those things where you buy X units if you want X amount, for example 30 units for an Ounce, which should be $360).<br /><br />However, when I added the 30 units to my shopping card, instead of the total being 120ish bitcoins, it was 130. For some reason, even with the listed exchange rate at the bottom of the page saying $2.99 (which would make the bitcoin price be 4.01 coins), the cost per unit was 4.34 bitcoins. WTF?<br /><br />So, because of this bug, the ounce of weed which should cost $360 is showing up in my shopping cart at roughly $390.<br /><br />What&#039;s going on here and how quickly can this be fixed?

				Let me add that if you change the current display to bitcoins, the displayed price is $4.34 instead of $4.01.<br /><br />So, to summarize:<br /><br />- Current listed dollars per bitcoin is $2.99<br />- Price with units set to dollars is $12<br />- Price with units set to bitcoin is 4.34 (should be 4.01).<br /><br />

				Doing more investigating, it&#039;s not just rook&#039;s item, it seems to be all items.<br /><br />Something is definitely wrong with silk road right now...it&#039;s almost as if there is like a 12% commission that isn&#039;t being added to the price when you look at it in dollar units.

				Yes, this funkiness was going on after the first outage, and it still appears to be an issue.<br /><br />The item I am looking is 127 in USD.&nbsp; But, do the conversion based on the btc price and the current value of BTC at the bottom of the page and it is 147 USD.<br /><br />Some explanations would be deeply appreciated.&nbsp; Any mods out there?

				This is definitely some sort of fundamental conversion bug.<br /><br />For example, I currently have .25 bitcoins in my account (waiting on a transfer). The posted conversion at the bottom of the page is $3.10 per bitcoin. So, .25 x 3.10 = .775, which is how many cents it should say I have when the site is set to dollars.<br /><br />However, it says I have .71 cents.<br /><br />This conversion problem is affecting EVERY SINGLE ORDER where the item is priced in dollars by the vendor. <br /><br />PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP.

				Shit, and I thought I was going crazy. Item I wanted to buy before the outage was around $230. Now it&#039;s almost $300&nbsp; :&#039;(&nbsp; Yikes!

				lol I couldn&#039;t tell if every seller increased their prices or SR upped their commission, but neither of those reasons made sense because my seller had not logged in since the site came back up and no way SR upped their rate by 500%

				This is not a bug and it has always worked this way.&nbsp; We use a 24 hour moving average of the exchange rate to adjust vendor&#039;s prices, not the up-to-the-minute exchange rate you see in the bottom left.&nbsp; So, when the price moves quickly, there can be a discrepancy between these two rates.&nbsp; That&#039;s the point though, we don&#039;t want sharp intraday fluctuations in the exchange rate to push the prices on the site all around.

				Thanks for clearing this up, Silk.&nbsp; Maybe having both the live price and the 24 hour average posted would help alleviate future confusion

Would you mind providing that information though (24 hour floating average)? I kind of feel like the number in the bottom left should just be the number that silk road is using for it&#039;s internal exchange rate (which is based on the 24 hour floating average), and it makes me wonder what value the &quot;up to date&quot; exchange rate listing is...feels like it just creates the confusion that I experienced.

				Decentralized. I love it. BTC is worth whatever someone is willing to pay. $3ea. -$30ea. How much and how badly do you want my btc? You do not want to wait DAYS for your btc then you will pay more.&nbsp; The conversion rate is as joke. No matter where you go. Mt.Gox, Tradehill or an SR exchanger the rates are different and vary daily. Let&#039;s just say we all agree on a btc SR price. Then what? I am STILL going to sell my btc at the highest price. Just like now. Some people will pay more for quickness, safety and convenience.&nbsp; Those are my people. :) &quot;Hi guys&quot; Others want to bitch about the process and do nothing about it. They do not want to wait days for btc from whomever.com. They do not like the different SR exchangers&#039; pricing but love the fact that you can get btc in under 10 minutes. You gotta pay to play. Put some skin in the game. How much you got champ? <br /><br />I do not care so much what the SR price of btc is. I truly don&#039;t. I mean I do not want it to fall like a stone again. I do want it to go back up. But I am not going to let some arbitrary number get in the way of what I want.&nbsp; Up or down I only have X amount to spend. After that I am done.&nbsp; Also I do not mind the SR fees added on. But he&#039;s gotta fix those fucking bugs! Ctrl+f5 is killing me
