				You should take a look at the prices other vendors charge for weed, you&#039;re charging at a rate that can get you some pretty chronic bud with other vendors. I haven&#039;t smoked your weed, but it looks like ordinary shwaggy outdoor, nothing worth over $10 a gram given all the other options. That isn&#039;t to say there&#039;s no market for it. Good luck!

				Check this..&nbsp; Why would you give a drop addy to someone in a known scammer haven?<br /><br />And there is no way in hell that your herb is worth 320 something an ounce.&nbsp; I just picked up an ounce of shit that WAS actually sticky, for 230 with shipping just last week.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t even being competitive with those prices, you are taking the piss..&nbsp; For real.<br /><br />Unless you more then half your prices, and use PGP..&nbsp; You don&#039;t stand a chance.

				Foil bags pierce easily. Vaccuum seal bags will last longer. Mylar bags will last longer than vaccuum. Moisture barrier bags will last forever. You have no idea what your talking about. Just do a little research on the forums man. Ill say it again, anyone who purchases from you is in danger. Change your packing methods.<br /><br />Chaos
