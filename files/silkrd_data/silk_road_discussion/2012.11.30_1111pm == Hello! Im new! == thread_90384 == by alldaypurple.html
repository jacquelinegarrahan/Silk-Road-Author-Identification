				As the SR user base expands, we&#039;re getting increasingly less tech savvy users. That is obvious from the questions posed on this forum over the last year.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s just something we have to prepare for and work with. Every time I see a question like this, as reflexively annoyed as I might be, I check myself. Our goal is to bring cognitive liberty to everyone, regardless of intelligence or knowledge. We should expect that job will get harder over time.

What I see as the problem, is that far too many newbies simply do not wish to invest the time and effort needed to learn the ropes. How many times have we seen the sentiment expressed, &quot;I am in a hurry to make my first order.&quot;&nbsp; There was a time when people would lurk for a month, or even two, prior to making their first purchases. Now, all too often people appear to be unwilling to wait even 24h after they discover the site&nbsp; before diving in. <br /><br />Guru<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />&nbsp;For fuck&#039;s sake, the FIRST STICKIED thread in this forum is a guide for new members. With links to things like how to buy BTC. OP must have skipped right over it in order to post this.<br /><br />For real.. I don&#039;t want to sound like a &quot;well back in my day&quot; oldfag cause I&#039;ve only been here since May, but that&#039;s exactly what I did when I joined. I would never have posted a thread like this. It seemed almost disrespectful to do so. Why take up resources with my dumbass expecting everyone to hold my hand through this process when the info was all available right there?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Gotta echo what Captain Mal said as well. I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t mean to be rude, it&#039;s great when new people who are willing/eager to learn come on board. People who aren&#039;t though, are risky. They&#039;re more likely to get too hasty or fuck up and put the community at risk, by means getting caught themselves.<br /><br /><br />Also edited out my &quot;Why the influx of dumb people&quot; question, cause it was rude and stupid

				Greetings, I am also new to SR, but I was through in reviewing all stickied posts and the wiki as I believe a person should know a good bit about what they&#039;re getting themselves into!<br /><br />
