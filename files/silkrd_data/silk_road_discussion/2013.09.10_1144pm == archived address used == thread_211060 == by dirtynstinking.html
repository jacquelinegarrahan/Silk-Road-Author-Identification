				I got the same message.&nbsp; The main thing is to make sure you don&#039;t use the archived &quot;old&quot; address again as it might be invalid next time.&nbsp;

				Yeah I&#039;m dying here. I got that same message last week so last ween I changed the deposit address in my sr account settings. Well now a week later I transferred about $200USD to the new address and its not there. Usually with my old address it took me 1-2 hours. Well now it&#039;s been hours and hours and hours and hours and according to blockchain.info it has dozens of confirmations but still hasn&#039;t shown up in my sr account. I sent a msg to sr support but even on the sr support vendor page account it says they were last seen 8 days ago or so. <br /><br />This was a urgent purchase I needed to make to. From blockchain.info I can&#039;t tell if it even went threw the sr tumbler yet. It&#039;s kinda lost in purgatory, just says &#039;not spent&#039;.<br /><br />Any ideas?&nbsp; :(<br />

				I&#039;m always switching the address before I deposit something. One time when the site was more down then up I made a mistake and had the coins send to an old address, the address changed itself without me clicking &quot;get new address&quot; or maybe it was a huge lag.<br />Anyway I was shocked, then the coins came after 1-2 hours even tho the shown address was different from what I send them to.
