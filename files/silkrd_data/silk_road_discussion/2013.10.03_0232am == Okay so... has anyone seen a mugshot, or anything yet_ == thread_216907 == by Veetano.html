				For all we know, this could be the biggest and more elaborate troll in history. According to many people here, asking people at the FBI and related departments seem to have no clue about anything SR or DRP related. Has anyone seen a mugshot?<br /><br />DPR was all about the injustices of our current governments, the evil biasing and manipulation of the populations via the media.... etc. What better way to manipuate them? Trust me when I tell you, NEWS SITES CANNOT BE TRUSTED. They often get their information from other sites, including documents, or even &#039;interviews&#039;. An elaborate troll could have taken the time to spoof all of that information. A story so big, EVERYBODY is going to run with it without much investigation. The more sites accept it, the more likely TV News programs will accept it. This would NOT be the first time the media has been fooled.<br /><br />I just find it strange nobody at the FBI seems to now anything about this. These so called interviews can easily be faked. The people working at news stations are nothing more than random mother fuckers in charge of gathering information and putting stories together. They often have to take peoples words when they claim to be of importance depending on how badly they need information. A lot of information is not easily verified, and on top of that a lot of information is merely only checked with other news sites info(which could easily be wrong too).<br /><br />Or on the flip side I would like to point everyone to this thread<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216890.0<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve searched through countless FBI site seizures and every single one sticks to protocol. They also cite the exact reasons for why the site has been seized. I 100% believe that some sort of killswitch was activated. The watermark is a clear sign that the FBI hasn&#039;t actually gained control of the site.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Perhaps the watermark sign is some sort of troll mechanism? If DPR was arrested and the FBI did trigger something, what better way to alert us of it while simultaneously hinting that they were not completely succesful? I don&#039;t know. Just thinking outloud.

				&nbsp;Thanks, but I would like to point out I am 100% sober. I haven&#039;t done any drugs for over a year, let alone weed. <br /><br />The arguments are sound here. I&#039;m not trying to insinuate this is a hoax, I&#039;m just saying, think about it. There are a LOT of signs that hint at this being a huge troll. When you know about how the media operates you would know it isn&#039;t as hard to fool them as you might think.

				if the site comes back up and running than i will agree with you, but until than i cant , i do tho see your concerns and i have read a bunch of theories of what went down, but when the mods themselves who are his staff are confirming the details what more can we do, its not like we can get on the site anyway whether its a hoax or not, no access right now means everything is locked up and tied up, lesson learned moved things fast, and better back up measures need to be in place

				Lets please not forget this.<br /><br />According to these stories.... DPR is basically a multi-millionaire drug kingpen who RENTS a apartment with roomates who had no clue about his activities? Wait, an apartment? He also gave up access to the site and to his wallet containing $3million dollars before opting for silence to see an attourney? Something obviously is not right.<br /><br />Magic Man,<br /><br />Libertas only knows as much as we do, his thread isn&#039;t magical because it is stickied. He is just advising us to take appropriate action to protect ourselves.

				What I find most strange about it is, not one major news station has run a story on it, not even in small print running on the bottom of the tv screen, and even stranger is that no agency has made any statements regarding the take down. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s real, but there&#039;s definitely something strange about it! Not to mention, they say they seized $3.6 million in BTC&#039;s, there&#039;s no way there was only that many coins on this site! Where do you think the rest went!!??

				Oh, and as far as a bail hearing, I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s any way DPR will ever get bail. They said he potentially mafe $80 million in commish! They didn&#039;t say anything about seizing his personal coins, and I highly doubt that he doesn&#039;t have a shit ton of coins stashed away on a paper wallet, or a thumb drive somewhere. If he gets bail, they will never see him again!
