				Came across this while having a mooch on SR<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5288f86529<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how true his claims are about it not containing any harmful chemicals and being undetectable to the seasoned smoker. Reads like a Betterwear advert.<br />&nbsp;My first concern was that it was up for sale on SR. We know this kind of thing or even cutting other drugs occurs, but I feel violated now I know it&#039;s up there in the market.<br />&nbsp;My second concern is that some venders may purchase this to deceive the customers of the road<br />&nbsp;My third concern is that I&#039;ve fulfilled my own prophecy by writing this<br /><br />Momma always said I&#039;m the sharpest spoon in the draw

				Your not a spoon man, just a tool :P ;)<br /><br />But yeah not nice or good :&#039;(<br /><br />Im just about old enough to remember the days when drugs were mostly about drugs.

Who knows, maybe im just a young/old hippie ;D<br /><br />Probably should say that not all the above is true of everyone :-*<br /><br />Peace, love, drugs<br /><br />fg ;)

				reasons this sounds like a scam:<br /><br />FE is required<br /><br />this is the highest priced item the vendor sells<br /><br />all feedback is likely based of the smaller sales of digital books<br /><br />poor feedback from anyone who sells on SR would result in threats to sell the vendor out on the forum, thus ruining his rep for good bud, damaging his sales<br /><br />maybe it isnt but anyone who requires FE does so for one reason in my experience.

				This is the shit I don&#039;t like about marijuana. I stopped going to my favorite dispensary cause I swore they were using some shit like this, their buds seemed to lose a lot of quality and every strain was very similar both in look, smell and density. It&#039;s gross!

I know this is supposed to be a free market, but here you have a vendor selling something that is obviously intended to scam weed customers (which SR does have a lot of). In the long run, allowing cut chemicals to be sold on SR will result in lower quality crap being sold on the site, which in turn will have a negative effect on the entire community.<br /><br />Drugs should never be cut or fucked with in any way. Vendor should receive a warning and be instructed to remove this listing IMO.

				@kvalitetsbevisst - Thnx for quoting me. Went to modify my post and accidentally hit remove. The reason I don&#039;t like this product is because it pushes the same agenda the government does - telling me what I can do with my body. If I can&#039;t detect this shit, and obviously the dealer isn&#039;t telling me? That&#039;s bullshit. I can&#039;t wait to start growing for personal use.

				but in this instance we have a vendor selling a &#039;magic liquid&#039; which contents are not described.<br />all we know is that some crap is sprayed on bud which makes it weigh more.<br /><br />sounds harmful to health and its obviously not a benefit to the weed being processed.<br /><br />that is if this shit is even real, I agree that it sounds like a scam

				like I said, I didn&#039;t look at the ad (at the time SR was down) but if people wanna cut or spray let em do it. It&#039;s part of the game. The ones who deliver superior product will get all the business. I don&#039;t do coke anymore but when I did I bought from the minority of people that didn&#039;t stomp on their shit. I cut my M1 and molly sometimes for ...shock....harm reduction....before I sell it because you guys may ore load and post load etc but the streets don&#039;t. So I would cut magnesium etc into my MDMA or M1 to help customers with clenching. I would also add Vit B to help with energy metabolism and heart health and also Potassium which helps your body absorb things better. Cutting is not always a bad deal and it&#039;s very important to fight overdoses. When I sold people pure coke there would always be some idiot that would do too much to fast and end up sick. Same goes for molly. I sold a chick pure MDMA and she ate 3 capsules and had a fuckin near seizure. I don&#039;t lie to them I tell them it&#039;s cut and what it&#039;s cut with if asked. I also adjust my prices down a bit which helps because people feel like they&#039;re getting a better deal. Most people don&#039;t do this though and I am def aware how cutting can be bad in other cases. In regard to the MJ, like I said before if people wanna buy bunk ass weed let em. It falls on the buyer! Legit vendors / dealers generally won&#039;t do this and won&#039;t become profitable doing it either. Just go to people you trust. If someone wants to sell this shit more power to em.

				Cuts in selected cases are acceptable such as vitamins along with mdma or an inert bulking agent to make a pill the right shape and size.<br /><br />But with weed there is NO Excuse! It is just sick and any idiot who does this is just making the weed worth less money.<br /><br />Quality is always degraded and the damage done to health always goes up.

				Ya who the fuck cuts weed. That is the saddest thing I have ever heard. When I imagine weed dealers trying to make more money off their product, I think of leaving stems and leaves on the buds or selling the buds when they still are a little wet. Not using some magical spray.<br /><br />And the vendor makes some ridiculous claims. The spray has not THC in it but it will increase the buds potency. Sounds like some bs to me.<br /><br />Bud should be grown organic and kept that way. If growers are willing to use this spray, I cant imagine what products they used during their grow cycle.&nbsp; :(

				Good bud is heavy with resin, selling damp is bad enough when your 3g £20 bag dries out to 2.2g but this is preferable to smoking sugar.<br />Grit weed is also really bad but I have only seen this around my way for a brief phase, everyone avoids it. <br />Decent homegrown sells for £180 to&nbsp; £250 an ounce (28grams). Factory (grown in converted houses by illegal immigrants) weed sells for £160 to £180 per oz.<br /><br />Sprayed weed should only sell for £80 to £100 per 28g but dealers will buy it for £160 to knock out in £20 bags which he will only be able to sell if there is a drought on and people have no alternative.<br /><br />Still what you make in weight you lose in quality and get a bad reputation for selling low quality stuff at high prices. Dealers will avoid buying this to sell unless there is no alternative. These days every Tom, Dick and Harry is growing high quality strains as a hobby and selling what is left. There IS an alternative to polluted buds and soap bar more than ever nowadays and so there is less polluted smoke on the market.<br />The silkroad should be better quality than the street.<br /><br />These bulking agents are a rip off anyway, all they contain is sugar dissolved in water!<br /><br />Too much P when growing to try and force bud weight can also cause some pretty nasty weed to smoke.<br /><br />And does anybody remember that phase of superbud stuff giberilan or something iirc. Pretty dubious hormonal shit which caused the bud to be less than perfect and so not worth £10 a gram.<br />

				Have about 20 years experience with cannabis, hasj and oil and this shit started somewhere late nineties, the harder the dutch government became of large scale growers, the more of this crap, one would see.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lot&#039;s of good willing organic growers gave up, because of this hunt on growers.&nbsp; If you are in some high level multi-crime syndicate, you have other intentions that people growing, harvesting and drying it as it should.&nbsp; Those syndicates want one thing:&nbsp; cash and do whatever to make more out of less.<br /><br />Products used for this:<br /><br />-Water with dissolved sugar<br />-Water with dissolved glue (tapestry)<br />-Lead powder<br />-Glass powder<br />-Several scent and taste additives (linalool - citronellol - germaniol - clove oil - ... shit they use in the tobacco industry)<br /><br />And the worst, add chemical cannabinoids to the mix (JWH-xxx/AM-xxx) because they first shake/extract the harvest (for hasj or for iso-iol) and they add above items.<br /><br />Nice example what harm is done (instead of harm reduction) when a product a cannabis is illegal.<br /><br />Best advice if you suspect something:&nbsp; put in under microscope and you can see the crap or shake some up with 96% alcohol, you should have a nice green color.&nbsp; If you see particles falling down, or weird things floating then somebody put crap in it.<br /><br />Then throw it out, don&#039;t smoke it, don&#039;t sell, kill it!<br /><br />I will also report every listing on SR with this shit.<br /><br />OB<br /><br /><br />

				Fuck this grit/BRIX weed garbage and anyone that uses it. It may work in the EU, but I&#039;d think most of the US weed snobs (wink wink) would recognize this shit if someone is dumb enough to sell it domestically.

				^^<br /><br />but i cant for the life of me understand that spraying perfectly fine bud with some disgusting liquid won&#039;t ruin the potency?<br /><br />I&#039;ve just heard rumors of this method being used in amsterdam, but I&#039;ve never known anything about the product used though.<br /><br />either way, I can easily get a hold of better and more potent bud where I live than what I got a hold of the last time in the netherlands so it obvious that they&#039;re doing something to maximize profit.. unfortunately that affects quality at the same time .. which is a ridicilous trade IMO

				When i was in rehab as a teenager i found out about all the random chemicals added to marijuana to make it heavier and more &quot;profitable&quot;. I still smoke weed but thinking about the shit i&#039;ve heard is put in to add weight makes me want to not smoke.<br /><br />I heard things about oil, gas, liquid rubber, mr clean, and other kinds of random shit.<br /><br />This spray is definitely a random chemical bottle and probably contains some gas or oil, yes it makes more $$, but it also get&#039;s people sick. Marijuana is already full of harmful pesticides i don&#039;t need anymore cancer causing shit chemicals in my herb. GO ORGANIC<br /><br />M39 i heard is a man made strain made by asian gangs in Canada, and mixes hemp with the weed because hemp is denser and weighs more. It tastes like shit and gives you a bad high like you would if you smoked something that was 15-30% hemp or leaves from a tree. If my weed smells like chemicals and gives me headaches i throw it out now and don&#039;t talk to the dealer again.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
