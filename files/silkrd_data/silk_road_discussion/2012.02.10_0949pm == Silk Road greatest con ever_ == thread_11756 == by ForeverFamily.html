				The withdraw bug has actually been happening for a long time, but it definitely seems to have gotten worse lately. I don&#039;t think SR has just run off with the money but why he hasn&#039;t publicly addressed the issues or responded to the people who are missing coins is beyond me.

				That was my first thought once the customer appreciation sale was announced right after SR was down because of who knows what (gawker, guns, ect) a week or two ago. And now vendors can&#039;t withdraw their bitcoins...sounds fishy, but lets be positive and hope it is just a bug, after all SR is filled with them...I would go as far to say that SR has more bugs then drugs for sale&nbsp; ::) .<br /><br />Hopefully this is just a bit of paranoia on our part, because I would truly hate for our amazing vendors and community to get scammed and to go down in flames in such a way.

I think you are just being paranoid. (Too much weed?) My take is SR is swamped with work because of how fast the site is growing, that&#039;s why responses to this issue have been sketchy. That is why they are hiring. Until they&#039;ve got some extra hands on deck problem resolution will be a bit slow.

				Another reason to remain positive as Delta11 reminded me is all the time and money put into SR. Just look at how much faster and responsive SR and the forums were all of a sudden after that down time...I&#039;m sure that was in the works for a while. More then likely all these unlucky events are just a horrible coincidence.

He was the most successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy, as measured by vessels captured, taking over 470 prizes in his career.<br /><br /><br />And this one is most interesting, considering the occasion and timing:<br />http://www.lifehack.org/articles/management/life-lessons-of-the-dread-pirate-roberts.html<br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, there are quite a few things we can learn from the pirates of the 17th and 18th centuries. Like other organized criminals, pirates were consummate business people, whose taste for booty could only satisfied by shrewd thinking and practical action. Here, then, are six things the Dread Pirate Roberts might tell you if you hired him as a business consultant for your firm, or a life coach.<br /><br /><br />

If, hypothetically, he was going to make a run with all the coins, it would make perfect sense to keep the site up as long as possible to let as many bitcoins come in. Honestly, if this issue doesn&#039;t get fixed or properly addressed by SR by the time the weekend is over, then it&#039;s time to get (very) worried.<br /><br />Another theory that&#039;s interesting, is that maybe SR isn&#039;t conning everyone, but is actually handing off the business to another person, hence his name change.

				Just to let everyone know I have not read but the first half page of responses.<br /><br />I do not think this is the case whatsoever.&nbsp; There has been many of bugs in all different aspects. SHIT HAPPENS!&nbsp; As to why it wasn&#039;t publicly addressed, I think he does not want to scare of new vendors as well as well as long time vendors.&nbsp; He needs these people to be able to earn a commission.<br /><br />SR is going to make a hell of a lot more money in the long run through commissions than he would if he was to just shut down immediately and take everyones cash.&nbsp; You need to think, with all of this recent advertising through these news articals, there is going to be another influx of buyers as well as sellers.<br /><br />SR is the captain of this ship and he is going to be with until the bitter end.&nbsp; This experiment we have is just that, and he wants to see how far it can go and if it will change things (for the better). <br /><br />Stop with the paranoia! Yes their are glitches and bugs, but you must think this is a NEW development.&nbsp; Shit happens that is beyond our control or even his.&nbsp; But these issues that keep popping up will be addressed as soon as possible (just like they always are)!

				i think they are just under staffed, especially in the customer support side of things.<br /><br />although i cant understand why they transitioned to a new withdrawal system on the live site without properly testing it on a sandboxed silkroad, probably some issue with increasing the number of servers to handle the ever growing demand and keeping them all properly synchronized. see ccs and/or csp.<br /><br />fruity

With SRs new name and all could the customer appreciation sale have just been a ploy to create a massive flow of bitcoins from vendors, straight to SRs wallet, which he simply stretches out over a few days by avoiding the problem until he&#039;s milked it for all its worth, only to make his escape?<br /><br />--FF<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This guy&#039;s a scam artist appreciating the *idea* of an even bigger scam. Hopefully this thread indicates he got hit with the withdrawing bug trying to withdraw the bitcoins he scammed from a bunch of people recently. <br /><br />Yo, FF, suck a dick, bitch. I called you out from the beginning. I guess it&#039;s time to make a new account and try again. One day, that karma&#039;s gonna get you right up the ass. Shame you&#039;ll probably enjoy it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nope, no new account. I&#039;m sticking around. I bet I have an order from you next week ;D<br /><br />--FF<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dick.

				I don&#039;t think splitting would help. i made two transactions today, one was around 15 and the other 50 BTC. I got the 50 BTC but the 15 BTC didn&#039;t come. I&#039;m missing as small as 0.2 BTC and up to 60 BTC from one transaction, so size doesn&#039;t play a part in it.

				- i never thought for 1 sec SR would have that much of an effect on btc value....instinct tells me the laundry has been going on and i wouldn&#039;t be the least surprised if<br />&nbsp; some big names are using btc&#039;s to shift money around (not suggesting SR specifically...)...cos they obviously don&#039;t care about how big the amts are coming thru&#039;..<br /><br />- stick around, its possible they are still verifying the amt and where its got to.<br />

				Prepare for the inevitable. <br /><br />This place at some point will be gone. <br /><br />Whether Silk gets busted, decides to pack it in and fuck off or whatever. This place isn&#039;t going to be around forever. <br /><br />Find alternatives, hell, even set-up your own fucking shop. Do you guys realise how much $$$ he&#039;s making from the commission and escrow rape alone? The dude is going to be minted by the time this year is up. The logical decision for him would be to fucking bail. His philosophical bs rants is all for show, it&#039;s always been about the money.

				There&#039;s always going to be an element of risk. You&#039;re never going to eliminate that, because to do so would mean compromising his identity. Remember you&#039;re on a black market website. If you&#039;re not prepared to take risks you shouldn&#039;t be here. Anonymity is what drives Silk Road. If someone thinks they could do a better job with an alternative website, I&#039;d love to see it.
