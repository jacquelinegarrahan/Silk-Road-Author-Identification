				We&#039;ve been deleting them every day, but they simply re-register the same username and continue to spam via PM.&nbsp; Brought it to DPR&#039;s attention and he said there&#039;s nothing else to do right now, so the best idea is to set your forum settings so that it doesn&#039;t show when you are online.
