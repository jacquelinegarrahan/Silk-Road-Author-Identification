				I&#039;ve never ordered anything that was too big for envelopes. If I ordered say, a zip of something what would it come in? Box? Would I ever need to sign?

				well, no vendor is going to give away their secret recipe for packaging. but suffice it to say, USPS has flat rate boxes up to pretty large/heavy. an o of weed, rock, powder or whatever would easily fit and ship in that. internationally speaking, international shipping services all have similarly-sized packaging options.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a vendor, but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;d be along those lines.

				oh, bud is no problem for the pros on the Road. a lot of them are large order only, even. I have my own preferences, but you might do well to check out the cannabis vendor review thread over in the Rumor Mill if you want to see reports from people who do regular big orders.<br /><br />but yeah, I know several off the top of my head who ship by the QP daily and have never lost a package if you need any referrals. :)

				All my orders go out in cadaver&#039;s, there&#039;s just so many places to hide an eighth of weed. Did I mention the endless possibilities you could have after you find your order.&nbsp; ;)

				While I generally do not approve of posting packaging detail, I will say since I do not vend illegal items at all and in general my packaging size is between 6x8 inches and 8x 16 inch boxes that you can get for free from the USPS Flat Rate Priority boxes. Mine items generally come in boxes that might not quite fit in an average or small mailbox.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
