				Once you upgrade your buyer account to a vendor account you are supposed to get an account on this forum along with your purchase that says you are a vendor. Where is this / how do I get this after you upgrade?<br /><br />Second, there is a vendor forum where vendors post on the blacklist etc to avoid scamming buyers etc, I cannot find a link anywhere to this either.

				Ohh Gotcha. That sucks, how am I supposed to get the initial 35&nbsp; transactions so that I can advertise here on the forums and let people know about my listings etc ? Any suggestions?

This is a very common problem in business in general, where you have a guy that is supposed to be running the company with you, and he could be making a ton of money for himself if he would just work, but instead insists on being on facebook all day. In the legit business world good businessmen are very keen to this and know that if they see this in a partner etc to run the other way. This is no different. If you see your vendors doing this, stop using them.
