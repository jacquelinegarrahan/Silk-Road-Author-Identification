				I made the interpretation of this ENTIRE post that took forever to type lmao. ANYWHO, I&#039;m about to make an edit that will insert a quote after your&#039;s and let you know that the majority of that was semi-sarcastic and exaggerated. I can see why you would respond with that, but I&#039;m sorry you had to waste the time to write as what I just said negates the majority of your interpretation of my character.
