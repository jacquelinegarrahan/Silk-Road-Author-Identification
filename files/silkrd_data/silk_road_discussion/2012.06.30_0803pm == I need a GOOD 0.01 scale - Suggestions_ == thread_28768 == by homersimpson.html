				I bought a scale for £10/$15 off amazon and it was 0.1g scale. It didn&#039;t even work to 1g properly despite the 20 5* feedback and 1* of some other person.<br />I want a scale that is obviously 100% to the gram 100% to the 0.1g and 98% correct to the 0.01 gram mark.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind doubling my money up to £20/$30 but I don&#039;t really want to pay any more :( Drugs seem more appealing :(.<br />If it came down to it and I really can&#039;t get a reliable one for that price then I could (not happily) go up to £40/$60 but don&#039;t really want to.<br />I don&#039;t deal I just want it for the 50-300mg range mainly especially for substances such as AMT etc.<br /><br />Please help me out :(. Also I&#039;m from the UK

				Myco MZ-100. They&#039;re £10 on amazon or £8-9 on ebay, I&#039;ve had 6 pairs of scales before, 4 of which were the MYCO MZ-100s, The reason being that they are the most accurate cheap scales I&#039;ve had, I&#039;ve had so many sets because I either broke them or sold them, But yeah you can&#039;t go wrong with them :)

				Yeah I&#039;ve seen it around a few times thanks for the suggestion :) would you risk an OD on this scale if the OD range was more than 0.10mg difference though?<br />

				Unfortunately, cheap pocket scales aren&#039;t worth a shit beyond a couple tenths of a gram.&nbsp; To get high precision and accuracy&nbsp; you need to drop a couple hundred bucks on a good set of laboratory scales.<br /><br />Eyeballing it is. :)

				I use an American Weigh 20 (AMS-20) milligram scale. If you calibrate it right and leave it on a flat surface, it&#039;s pretty consistent with +-2mg window. It handles 100ths and 10ths very well. It is now $27 on clearweb but I have seen them slightly cheaper and also very much more for the same scale. It is not made in america but it&#039;s not bad for the price/accuracy trade-off.<br /><br />Clear web link:<br />http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM<br /><br />I use it to weigh estimations of 25i for my friend to make his blotters. It seems pretty successful for most milligram RCs. It would be fine for most street drugs.

I haven&#039;t found anyone who uses it that says anything &gt; 5mg +- variation.<br /><br />I know the issue you&#039;re talking about with the tray, because of the recessed area but I find it to be quite accurate. I have had very good success and comparison success with it.<br />It usually tares within 2mg to the calibration weights and I have had very good success with comparing others&#039; weights on it and within 5mg +-.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t clearly see the difference between 30mg and 75mg, maybe the scale isn&#039;t the problem. Since the OP asked for a scale accurate to hundredths (0.01) this scale would be something I suggest for sure.<br /><br />I recently sent out ~58mg (median of 3 measurements) of an RC to someone who weighed it upon arrival with a &#039;school scale&#039; and it came out to 59mg. I&#039;ll take 1-5mg +- variation but definitely not 50-100mg variations.<br /><br />It has been effective in my experience, sorry you have problems with it but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s useless to everyone. <br /><br />What is your suggestion? Price aside, what do you suggest?<br />

				I wonder if vendors would be interested in weighing out doses on drugs that a little makes a big difference. Then putting the smaller dosage checked bags in 1 bag... Depending on the quantity of course. For a certain amount of bit coins.

				While we&#039;re on the topic of scales, where would you guys suggest buying one? A friend of mine gave me his old one, but it broke recently. I&#039;d rather not hunt for one on the clearnet, especially though amazon/ebay. In the unlikely event of a raid/investigation, it would take all of ten minutes to link my PayPal to a purchase of a scale. Sure, there&#039;s nothing illegal in just that, but you really can&#039;t be too cautious. They&#039;d throw &quot;intent&quot; around in court, I&#039;m sure.<br /><br />Are there any nation-wide USA stores that sell decent scales?
