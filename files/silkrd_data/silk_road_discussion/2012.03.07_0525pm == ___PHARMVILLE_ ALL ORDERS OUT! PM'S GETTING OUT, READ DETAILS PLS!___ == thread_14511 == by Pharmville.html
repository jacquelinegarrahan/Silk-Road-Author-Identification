				Hi Everybody<br /><br />Well, I worked all night and got out all the DCN&#039;s for Mon and Tues.<br /><br />Ben has assured me that all the orders will be in the box before last collection except possibly 5-10 and they wil still go to the box later tonight but not really travel anyplace till tomorrow.<br /><br />I am working my way through the pm&#039;s as fast as my fingers will carry me.&nbsp; I have 180 of them that just popped up in about a day and a half so pls bear with me and I&#039;ll get you answers as fast as I can.&nbsp; I think between all day today and tonight and then part of tomorrow, they&#039;ll all be answered. <br /><br />We just had to make getting the huge influx of orders our first priority knowing that people want to see their product in hand more than anything else and we did get his with a huge tsunami of them as soon as we opened the doors.&nbsp; But we haven&#039;t had to move to stealth mode yet and we hope not to so don&#039;t start any rumors or think that anything bad is happening.&nbsp; It&#039;s all happening and happening fast, it&#039;s just the pm&#039;s that are going to take time to answer right and get accurate info to everyone.<br /><br />have a great day everybody,<br />Alex

				LOL paperchasing.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Alex, I got my order today before I even noticed the DCN in my inbox. That&#039;s sweet. Going forward, take your time sending out my DCN. It&#039;s not that important because I trust you&#039;ll send things out when you say. So no worries. Besides, it not like I ever had a problem with you guys that I needed to use a DCN. And I know what a pain in the ass it is to have to do all those PMs with DCN over TOR&#039;s slow network. <br /><br />BTW, I&#039;m hitting you up with another order today or tomorrow. Go some extra coin and figured no better place to spend it. ;)<br /><br />Have a good day and take care. <br /><br />BenJesuit

				So - what does that mean for those of who ordered but HAVE NOT received a DCN - or any correspondence confirming our orders?<br /><br />I ordered Monday, around noon eastern time, and have received a PM from Pharmville since then, but it was unrelated to my order, it was a reply to a question I has asked Sunday about PGP and no mention of my order was made.<br /><br />Since I ordered Monday morning my order status hasn&#039;t changed - still listed as processing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to PM Pharmville again if I don&#039;t have too, but I&#039;m not sure what to do here - I purchased the Priority Mail option also .&nbsp; I&#039;m new to the Silk Road but this isn&#039;t my first order . . . . <br /><br />Any insight would be appreciated . . . should I contact Pharmville again or what?&nbsp; It was a $300+ order, just want to be sure they were able to read my PGP address, etc, not having ANY confirmation that they&#039;ve received my order 48+ hours after placing it worries me a little bit . . .

				Thantos I dont mean to speak on their behalf but I&#039;ve done enough business with them to share my personal experience<br /><br />dont worry, if you put your order in they&#039;ve taken care of it. I assume they&#039;re just massively swamped and in the past I&#039;ve gotten immediate responses the one time there was an issue. 8) <br /><br />It seems like they provide a DCN on the day your order arrives (probably so we&#039;re not all bombing USPS tracking lol)<br /><br />I ordered on sat right when they relisted, got my DCN and my package this morning, which was the first communication for the order since I had put it in.

				I appreciate that&nbsp; -&nbsp; being new to the Silk Road I was getting really worried.&nbsp; The hardest part about online ordering for me is remaining calm while the package ships . . . as that&#039;s when I&#039;m the most nervous.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you wrote me back, it definitely makes me feel better knowing that others have had similar experiences, I still wish they&#039;d PM me a DCN to put my mind at ease, but again - knowing I&#039;m not alone makes me feel MUCH better . . . . <br /><br />So you ordered Saturday and received today?&nbsp; If I ordered Monday - around noon, when do you think I&#039;d receive?&nbsp; Any clue???

				Yeah, Thantos, don&#039;t worry. If you messed up PGP, you would have heard about it. You&#039;ll see your order in the mail tomorrow or Friday at the latest. The cutoff for same day shipping is 9AM. So your order went out on Tues. Weds at the latest. <br /><br />Priority Mail is 2 to 3 days. Depends on where you live and how good your post office and the sorting hubs to it are. <br /><br />And DCNs are really only useful is something went wrong - like sent to wrong address. Most sellers on here don&#039;t even bother with the hassle of a DCN and the orders get there without issue.

				First - to the boys @ PV; if ANYTHING i&#039;m saying is out of place I&#039;m more than willing edit/delete or have a mod blow me out. they&#039;re just so amazing at what they do that anything I can do to help alleviate fears from others I&#039;m more than willing to do. they just kick too much ass not to praise them from the hill tops&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />I really think they choose to do the DCN/shipping confirmation as a way of protecting themselves as much as protecting us. lets say they do X orders every night and ship them out when they do. if X people from across the country were bombing USPS every couple hours, every day until the pack arrives, I would think that doing this day in day out and all originating from the same area it may raise a flag? just my personal thought on that<br /><br />I placed the order right when they relisted. on their page they said if you order sat/sun they wont even bother shipping out till sun night just to play it safe so packs arent sitting idly by for any longer than necesary<br /><br />so from the DCN it got first-sorted early early monday morning and I had it today. so three delivery-days door-to-door for me. I dont know where you are (and dont want to know to be honest :p ) but three days seems to be the standard for priority mail around here<br /><br />if you ordered monday I would assume (again this is just my brain flushing things out and does not represent them in any way) I would assume it got first-sorted early tuesday which most likely means you&#039;ll get your DCN and the pack on friday<br /><br />I too freak out from the moment I hit buy until the pack is in my hands, I&#039;m sure everyone here is a bit like that, its the nature of the beast, but they kick ass and Ive had nothing but amazing luck and communication with them<br /><br />hth<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think you count the day of shipment. Mine shipped out on Monday also and arrived today. In USPS speak, that&#039;s two days. <br /><br />Can&#039;t say I freak out once I hit the submit button anymore. But there was some anxiety on my very first order on SR. But I resolved that if things went south, I was willing to lose that money. But now, with Pharmville, it&#039;s like clockwork. <br /><br />Sometimes I wish I knew these guys in real life and could chip in and help out. They are a integral part of history and they are one of the few pillars of Silk Road that make this place great.

				Thanks for all the replies guys - I really appreciate it!<br /><br />One more question though, does it matter that my 60 hour old order is still &quot;processing&quot;?<br /><br />Does Pharmville make a habit of at least updating the status to shipped, or in-transit - forget about the DCN, I just thought they would switch the status to in-transit, especially after posting that thread last night saying all the orders went out from Monday &amp; Tuesday, and everyone would be receiving their respective DCNs.<br /><br />Since my status didn&#039;t change, and I didn&#039;t receive a DCN, after the vendor posted that message saying everyone who ordered was taken care of and could expect a DCN, that was when I began to worry . . . <br /><br />Sigh . . . I guess we wait and see.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a somewhat remote location, but if you goto USPS.com and &quot;create a shipment&quot; you&#039;ll notice Priority mail from pretty much anywhere to pretty much anywhere is 2 days, though like many of you I&#039;ve had shipments take 3.&nbsp; 2 days is the ideal, 3 is more realistic.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just WISH I had heard SOMETHING from Pharmville.<br /><br />Thanks again for following-up with me guys!<br /><br />

				Yeah, they will change it to in transit so you can finalize. In my experience, over the dozens of orders I&#039;ve done with PV, on the day it is slated to arrive is usually when it turns to in transit with PV, which is perfect since I finalize on receipt. I never make them wait for their loot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Look on the bright side; some vendors mark in transit yet haven&#039;t shipped it out. Worse still some do it and ask you to finalize early. <br /><br />No worries Thantos, you&#039;re in good hands. <br /><br />BTW, you did hear from Pharmville. Right up there in the opening post.

				Got my xanax today.&nbsp; This is the same exact stuff I used to get directly from serbia.&nbsp; 100% legit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for getting these.&nbsp; I almost never thought I would see this brand of xanax in america again (unless I got it shipped here from my old connection).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, another typical Pharmville transaction.&nbsp; Order was shipped monday, and arrived to the east coast by thursday.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t be happier.&nbsp; will be buying more in the next few days.<br /><br />Thanks again

				From reading their sellers page, it looks like they aren&#039;t going to send out DCN&#039;s anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;m good with that, just so long as they start marking things as shipped as soon as it goes out.&nbsp; I know how long things take to get to me, so I dont need to track it, just so long as I KNOW that its gone out.<br /><br />By the by, the order I placed early Tuesday morning got here today.&nbsp; I love Pharmville, they&#039;re by far the best vendor I&#039;ve dealt with in over 100 transactions.&nbsp; I miss having the overnight option, but still, priority is wicked fast.
