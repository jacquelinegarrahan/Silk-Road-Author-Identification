				2nd what OP said.&nbsp; It&#039;s not even the doctors so much as the pharmacists.&nbsp; They will flat out lie to you and say they don&#039;t have the medication in stock.&nbsp; I caught them doing it.&nbsp; One time I said, fine, just order it and call me when it comes in.&nbsp; They said it could take up to a week or two.&nbsp; They never called and a week later when I called them not only was it ready but they filled it the very day I dropped it off. (The date was on the label).&nbsp; I decided then no more.&nbsp; I went without for about 6 weeks or so and said F-it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to live my life in pain.&nbsp; I will get my meds only from SR.&nbsp; It costs more obviously but my privacy is more important.&nbsp; I hate to wish bad things on anyone but the old &quot;walk a mile in my shoes...&quot; comes to mind often.&nbsp;

				I absolutely LOVE being able to sell my Xanax powder for so cheap that it is actually cheaper for my US clients, even with insurance to purchase through me. Although I ship out of Canada, over 80% of my business is in the USA and a big reason for this is SO many of my repeat customers have legitimate needs for this medication but they simply cannot afford the doctors visits and prescription costs. One customer told me for every gram he buys off me saves him and his family $700 in doctors visits and prescription costs so it is actually NOT such an awful thing that people have to buy their medication from here because when you are actually saving a family that much money they are benefiting from this site existing very much so. Many people ask me why I sell my product so cheap as other vendors are charging way more than me for lower quality powder and the answer is always the same, I love helping people in need and also simply just making people happy. I go to bed happy every night knowing I am making a great difference in people&#039;s lives :) I am really helping out people with medical needs which just makes me feel GREAT and even those that just like to get a buzz I love providing them with pure product for cheap as well :)<br /><br />&nbsp;I know some prescription medication on here is VERY expensive and overpriced and if people have legitimate needs for things like opiate painkillers but have to resort to buying them from here because abuse and sale diversion has made doctors SO scared to prescribe opiates even for people in legitimate pain than I do really feel for those people but at least this site exists so people do need need to make dangerous&quot;street&quot; style drug sales. It is MUCH safer for both the buyer and seller to do business on here than in real life in a street setting.

Although I ship out of Canada, over 80% of my business is in the USA and a big reason for this is SO many of my repeat customers have legitimate needs for this medication but they simply cannot afford the doctors visits and prescription costs. One customer told me for every gram he buys off me saves him and his family $700 in doctors visits and prescription costs so it is actually NOT such an awful thing that people have to buy their medication from here because when you are actually saving a family that much money they are benefiting from this site existing very much so. Many people ask me why I sell my product so cheap as other vendors are charging way more than me for lower quality powder and the answer is always the same, I love helping people in need and also simply just making people happy. I go to bed happy every night knowing I am making a great difference in people&#039;s lives :) I am really helping out people with medical needs which just makes me feel GREAT and even those that just like to get a buzz I love providing them with pure product for cheap as well :)<br /><br />&nbsp;I know some prescription medication on here is VERY expensive and overpriced and if people have legitimate needs for things like opiate painkillers but have to resort to buying them from here because abuse and sale diversion has made doctors SO scared to prescribe opiates even for people in legitimate pain than I do really feel for those people but at least this site exists so people do need need to make dangerous&quot;street&quot; style drug sales. It is MUCH safer for both the buyer and seller to do business on here than in real life in a street setting.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is so true. In the Uk here i can get real valium for around £150-£200 for 1000. I was shocked to see the prices so high on here! But i suppose it saves people some hassle and in america especially where you have private healthcare it must help a lot of people.&nbsp; In the UK we have the NHS which despite what people say actually isn&#039;t bad for a free service. The only problem with it is that it&#039;s no longer being able to hold patients as long as needed and funding isn&#039;t being spent on the people who really need it ecause the government lets people come over from any country and get free care for nothing , the people that stay here sometimes get turned away because of this. <br />I witnessed a guy come over from bulgaria or was it romania, either way, he got free cancer treatment that would have cost thousands and thousands of pounds and was terrible to the nurses looking after him he made it as hard as possible, what an asshole, but the worst happened when he was leaving, He got his 2 sons to come up and steal the television from the cancer ward. You do not get lower than that, That is those people stuck there&#039;s one enjoyment really. It&#039;s sad to see things like this happen.

				LOL @ Jack N&#039; Hoff. You realize that you&#039;re known for the company you keep. That makes you shady too, son. <br /><br />What&#039;s worse? Big Pharmer charging 5000% markup or SR dealer charging 100-500% markup?<br /><br />SR dealers aren&#039;t running a charity. They&#039;re risking their freedom so it has to be worth their while. Big Pharma doesn&#039;t have that problem. They are authorized by the state to both rip you off and sell you things that are harmful to your health and well being.

Incredibly, despite everything, the black market is more efficient than the legal market in many cases.<br /><br />Take Xanax since that is your example. The company that produces it sells it for 500,000% more than the raw ingredients per pill. Many other popular drugs are also in similar five or six digit territory.<br /><br />Not even the mark-up on heroin from production to the street can compare with this (in theory it could be over 50,000%).<br /><br />This is due to a combination of factors but it is mostly because large pharmaceutical companies are stepping outside the market mechanism.<br /><br />I appreciate that it takes hundreds of millions of dollars to build serious pharmaceutical factories and research laboratories, but this does not in any way explain decades long continuation of profits this high. Besides in practice you&#039;ll find that research gets pittance. <br /><br />Ignore everything you hear the pharmaceutical industry say about their operations, they put incredible money into lobbying, you can trust their estimates about as much as an OPEC report on reserves. Everything you see or hear is a Potemkin village. It&#039;s all about destroying any competition. Oceans of whitepapers are published straight into a black hole. The evidence for this? A complete lack of effective new drugs.<br /><br />It is an open conspiracy against the consumer. What happens is that a company like Pfizer will get infinite IP protection (TM) by developing drug analogs of their existing line, extending property rights far beyond what could be reasonable, decades beyond. They then fool/lobby/bribe various branches of the government to prevent any competing overseas factories delivering to these shores, usually on the basis of &quot;ensuring innovation&quot; or &quot;protecting jobs&quot; depending on who they&#039;re fucking. <br /><br />Imports not part of the cartel arrangements are considered to be counterfeits. Counterfeits do exist and can be dangerous, but really this is total FUD because it is very far from representative (and any drug given to a sufficiently large population always kills a couple of people, that is just normal, everybody rational would accept such a tradeoff, just as we implicitly accept that using coal powered stations must indirectly contribute to the deaths of miners). <br /><br />The result is that drug prices are normalized to very high levels despite huge economies of scale. The black market is a model student in comparison and I would say that the equivalent of tens of millions of years of human life has already been lost because of this cartel. Under a real market, Americans would live a good bit longer than they do now, that is fact. <br /><br />Pine hopes that with Darknet markets will ultimately evolve production capability, then real market forces will eventually be able to break the back of the legal drug cartels, because the government is completely impotent at regulating itself let alone Pfizer and the little blue pill is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />

				Pine, you&#039;re saying they are paying $0.000001 per xanax?&nbsp; They charge like a dollar for 120 of them...<br /><br />So like a million xanax for a dollar?&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t sound right to me.

				Doesn&#039;t the same company Pfiser make BOTH the OxyContin and the Suboxone ?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So they manufacture both the disease and the cure.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nice.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing they knew it would eventually be taken off the market and began rolling out the suboxone/buprenorphine at the perfect time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m always curious about that Xanax powder around here.&nbsp; Its either leaked from a lab or else people are just crushing tablets and cutting it with adulterants.&nbsp; Either way, its neat how they come out with sneaky ways to introduce a new addictive drug.&nbsp; Xanax isn&#039;t an opiod, so it gets labeled with the benzos even though it produces narcotic-like euphoria and much harder withdrawals - all to the tune of ca-ching, bling-bling.&nbsp; Get this shit into every medicine cabinet in America.&nbsp; Teens will figure the rest out and bring mommys pills down to the street level.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think big pharma is using social behavior and other tactics to sell their drugs.&nbsp; I think they are now planning for tactics to get their drugs approved and labeled as harmless as possible.&nbsp; Then they seem to plan for the future outcomes, complimentary drugs (benzos go great with Opiods?) and strategies to get youth talking and thinking about the medicine cabinet as a source of recreation and profits for them.<br /><br />So much has changed since the 1980s .&nbsp; Remember when every woman in America had &#039;Migraine&#039; headaches that needed a Tylenol 3 Script ?&nbsp; Christ, my mother and every mom on our street was popping those and talking about this brand-new kind of headache called a migraine.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; You can tell your doctor you have this migraine thing, and he gives you some pills with codeine, just like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tylenol was teaching people what a migraine is, and making people feel like they might suffer from it. The only treatment at the time was Tylenol with codeine.&nbsp; Commercials are powerful influences.&nbsp; Anyway, nowadays migraines aren&#039;t even making the conversation around the office water cooler.&nbsp; I guess they are all cured now.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Today, its Autism.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every kid with bad grades gets to blame it on that.&nbsp; Parents can rest easy knowing it wasn&#039;t their fault, no waaaay it was Autism&#039;s fault.&nbsp; Ya, of course it was that.&nbsp; What that? You say nobody can prove autism? There is no diagnostic testing?&nbsp; A kid could just be lazy, or having a bad day and get a bad score on a 10 minute autism screening test and be labeled just like that?&nbsp; &nbsp;Handed some addictive Ritalin™ stimulant and be on his way to a lifetime of amphetamine dependence.&nbsp; Start them young like cigarettes haha.<br /><br />I wonder what big pharma will use next to convince us we are sick with something, but don&#039;t know it?&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe it will be hormone replacement therapies, or health meds to enhance living.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, the distant future will finally bring some recreational medications.&nbsp; Safe, fun time meds to treat boardom and restlessness.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure we will all think we are sick regardless.&nbsp; Its nice to have something to blame stuff on and a reason to take feel-good pills.<br /><br />I wonder when big pharma will start launching their research meds on Silk Road?&nbsp; They could use buyers here as testers of new drugs.&nbsp; Maybe they already are doing it, hah.

NOT the cost of raw materials which are always next to nothing.<br /><br />That and due to medical patent law, they only have 5, 10 or 20 years to make their buck before it goes off the generics and their IP value falls back to zero.<br /><br />Not saying its right and god knows US is a good example of how to get it wrong, but its not a reasonable comparison to make pharma to heroin, since one has all the non material cost and one has to be compensated for risking their freedom.<br /><br />my two bitcents.
