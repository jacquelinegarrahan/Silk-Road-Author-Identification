				If the amounts are less than 5 % off, I don&#039;t think there is anything to worry about with a small order as that was. If it was 5% of 1000$ I would be pretty upset that the vendor took that off the top.<br /><br />If he chooses to deny you service and gives you a refund, than I see no issue.

				I personally have nothing but good things to say about ENBOOM.<br /><br />I have made 2 purchases from ENBOOM.<br /><br />The first was flawless.<br /><br />The second purchase he shorted me by 20 tabs. When I told him he immediately sent me the 20 tabs, PLUS an extra 30 tabs, no charge.<br /><br />Hope ENBOOM&#039;s outstanding service has not changed since I have dealt with him/her/them.

				Let us go through this step by step.<br /><br />First let it be known Democo&#039;s order was placed Sunday afternoon (the 13th) and it clearly says on our seller page to give us up to 4 days to get the package out but here is the entire message history <br /><br />(STARTING 2 DAYS AGO)<br /><br />&quot;Democo&nbsp; &nbsp; I am about to put in a order today for the 10 NBOMBE, I will make a thread on the silkroad forums if you hook me up for you :)&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 days&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Democo&nbsp; &nbsp; I am about to put in a order today for the 50 NBOMBE, I will make a thread on the silkroad forums if you hook me up for you :)&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 days&quot;<br /><br />So here is the first sign that Democo was always ready to make a forum post.<br /><br />&quot;ENBOOM(100)&nbsp; &nbsp; We don&#039;t hook people up for forum posts anymore as we are already a well established member that have been here for a very long time. We always appreciate any nice words or constructive criticisms of our products though.<br /><br />Peace,<br />ENBOOM&nbsp; 1 day&quot;<br /><br />Democo then places his order and today we receive this.<br /><br />&quot;Democo&nbsp; &nbsp; I was wondering if I can get a refund for the order I placed since it&#039;s not shipped yet or will I have to wait the 3 days?&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 hours&quot;<br /><br />&quot;ENBOOM(100)&nbsp; &nbsp; We just haven&#039;t shipped it yet our shipper had an emergency today and wasn&#039;t able to drop by the post office today to mail it your package will definitely be going out tomorrow.As it says on our seller page our processing time is 1-4 days as we have real lives and real jobs to attend to.If you&#039;d like we can cancel your order for you if you want for a full refund. You have until 14 hours from this message to decide.<br /><br />Regards,<br />ENBOOM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 hour&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Democo&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, please cancel this order sorry about the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 hour&quot;<br /><br />&quot;ENBOOM(100)&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s canceled sorry we weren&#039;t able to ship as fast as you needed it.<br />ENBOOM&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 hour&quot;<br /><br />At this point we logged off to handle some other business and in the course of like apparently less than 10-15 minutes we get these 3 messages<br /><br />&quot;Democo&nbsp; &nbsp; Why am I missing 2 BTC from that order I just got refunded?&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 hour&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Democo&nbsp; &nbsp; Can we fix this because my Transaction history is a lot different then your post and I don&#039;t want to go around posting bad Rep can I just get my full amount back.&quot;<br /><br />1 hour&quot;<br /><br />So he only gave us a relatively short time before coming on here and declaring us a FRAUD and a THIEF?!<br /><br />Also lets look at his claimed &#039;order receipt&#039;<br /><br />status: processing<br />buyer: Democo<br />seller: ENBOOM(100)<br />item: 25i-NBOMe 1000ug HPBCD Complexed x50<br />quantity: 1<br />shipping: FirstClassUSA<br />postage: $0.07 &lt;--- who in their RIGHT MIND would only charge 7 CENTS For postage and packaging?! We have never charged that low (unless we offer free shipping)<br />total price: $72.15 &lt;---Our customers can come on here and back this up WE HAVE NEVER CHARGED THAT MUCH FOR X50 IN ALMOST A YEAR IT&#039;S PREPOSTEROUS our customers can back us up on this<br />ordered: January 4, 2013, 8:07 pm UTC &lt;--- Lie<br />shipped: January 4, 2013, 10:58 pm UTC &lt;--- Omega lie (AS IF WE COULD SHIP OUT YOUR PACKAGE IN 2 HOURS AFTER ORDERED)<br /><br />Also For further proof Here&#039;s an example order of 2 x50 order made a few hours before Democos *sensitive information removed*<br /><br />seller: ENBOOM(100)<br />item: 25i-NBOMe 1000ug HPBCD Complexed x50<br />quantity: 2<br />shipping: FirstClassUSA<br />postage: $0.98<br />total price: $87.15<br />ordered: January 13, 2013, 6:52 am UTC<br />shipped: processing<br /><br />Notice how its for 2 x50s and its only 15 dollars more than Democo&#039;s claimed price and the postage is the same as the refunded.<br /><br />He obviously hasn&#039;t read a single thing on our seller page nor our policies, is an impatient customer and is clearly trying albeit terribly to blackmail us with a forum post. Welcome to the vendor blacklist!<br /><br />Also, when we refund on SR we do not see your bitcoins or even touch them (as they are still in escrow) so how could we even have control of this,or what would be the motive for us to do so?!!? if you really feel like you got shorted take it up with SR support.We very promptly did what you asked and handled our end of the deal so this outright blackmail is downright offensive<br /><br />Please if you&#039;re going to try to discredit one of the longest running vendors on SR understand how SR works and how We work.<br /><br />[del]Have a nice day[/del]go fuck yourself<br />ENBOOM

This incurs a 4% hedging fee which you do not get back. Had you researched the refund process you would have realised that you also do not receive Silk Road commission back. The vendor does not receive this either; it goes straight to Silk Road.<br /><br />4% of $49.369, or ฿3.46 (BTC (the cheapest shipping option you could have selected for that item being ฿0.07)) is $1.974, or ฿0.1384.<br /><br />Silk Road commission on a $48.370, or ฿3.39 transaction (commission is not charged on the shipping fee) amounts to $4.837, or ฿0.33899.<br /><br />The amount returned to you (by Silk Road, NOT by ENBOOM) would have been as follows:<br /><br />$49.369 - ($1.974+$4.837), which equals $42.558, rounded to $42.56. In Bitcoin, this amount would be ฿2.98265.<br /><br />In short, you received $6.811 - or ฿0.47735 - less than you paid.<br /><br />Do your goddamn research on the fee system, and how hedging etc. affects refunds, before exercising those nasty little fingers of yours.

The vendor does not receive this either; it goes straight to Silk Road.<br /><br />4% of $49.369, or ฿3.46 (BTC (the cheapest shipping option you could have selected for that item being ฿0.07)) is $1.974, or ฿0.1384.<br /><br />Silk Road commission on a $48.370, or ฿3.39 transaction (commission is not charged on the shipping fee) amounts to $4.837, or ฿0.33899.<br /><br />The amount returned to you (by Silk Road, NOT by ENBOOM) would have been as follows:<br /><br />$49.369 - ($1.974+$4.837), which equals $42.558, rounded to $42.56. In Bitcoin, this amount would be ฿2.98265.<br /><br />In short, you received $6.811 - or ฿0.47735 - less than you paid.<br /><br />Do your goddamn research on the fee system, and how hedging etc. affects refunds, before exercising those nasty little fingers of yours. Blatant lying will also ALWAYS be caught out here. You&#039;re an idiot.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />touche!

				HaHa way to go OP, you vindictive little bastard!<br /><br />Emboom could not have bought this free positive publicity, what a win.<br /><br />I was one of the first on SR to buy from Enboom, and I just put another order in before this thread hit the posts.<br /><br />I am happy to bump this thread, and endorse my dealings with the Enboom team.<br /><br />This is what makes the Road so cool, if you are a straight shooter, you always get get JUSTICE here. <br /><br />Props to the dudes and babes(?) at SR as well, it could not happen without them.<br /><br />murungu.<br /><br />

				Well we had thought this matter closed but just now we received a message from Democo and it really suprised us.<br /><br />&quot;Democo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I possibly get .5 BTC back from the 2 I am close to something I want to get. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37 minutes&quot;<br /><br />We wonder if he has even read this thread and realized what a colossal ass he&#039;s been outed as being.<br /><br />Hopefully whichever vendor decides to do business with him has better luck than we did.

				I&#039;m pretty sure two vendors complain about this form of extortion from a SR member and that member gets removed along with his blackmail feedback.
