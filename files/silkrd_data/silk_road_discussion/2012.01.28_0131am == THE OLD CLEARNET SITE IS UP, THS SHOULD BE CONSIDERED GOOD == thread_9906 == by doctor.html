				Hey, the old&nbsp; clearnet site http://silkroadmarket.org/ is still up! I&#039;m guessing that is good...<br /><br />just conjecture out of thin air on my part, but if it was a federal takedown, that site would be dead, if it was silk just disappearing and never being heard from again, this forum would be dead. <br /><br />

				Thank you for the info doctor,<br /><br />I actually didn&#039;t know there was an easy way to the SR, I always use the .onion.<br /><br />Why does it generate discussion on the bitcointalk forum instead that in this one? :S

				It&#039;s just a site that says &quot;this is not thesilk road, but you are close&quot; an lead to the gawker article, then on day the servers went down and they posted that message. never been updated again. <br /><br />it pointed to bitcoin forums because at the time the forums were just hosted on the same server.
