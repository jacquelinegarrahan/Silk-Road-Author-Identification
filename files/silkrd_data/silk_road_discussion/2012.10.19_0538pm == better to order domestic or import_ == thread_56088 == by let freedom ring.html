				a friend of mine told me he only orders out of country because the vendor is less likely to be LE, is this a legitimate concern or is he just being overly paranoid? <br /><br />what i want is here in the states and the delivery time is ridiculously shorter than from other countries so obviously id like to order from a vendor here in the states, just looking for some feedback or opinions first. thanks a million my friends!<br /><br />also domestic orders don&#039;t have to go through customs, another plus to ordering domestic right??

				i dont think just because its not domestic means they are less likely to be LE<br /><br />just use the reviews and feedback to make good decisions on who to buy from, and use the common precautions like safe addresses/ not signing if you dont expect to have to<br /><br />definitely a reduced risk during shipping and quicker because no customs as you mention<br />

				Your friend is a sketchball..<br /><br />If you order from an established vendor there is virtually no chance that the are going to be LE<br />and yeah domestic has the plus of faster shipping times and no customs but on the downside products can be cheaper overseas

				One customs seizure letter was enough to convince me that domestic was the &quot;much&quot; safer route. There are not the dope dogs sniffing every single overseas sent package. Plus if it is a reputable vendor with good feedback it seems much safer. Yes overseas can be less expensive but customs is very adept at ferreting out most of our goodies. Domestic i believe is much safer ! What would you rather pay, a few extra bucks for your meds or an exorbitant lawyers fee.

				I&#039;ve had success with both. Do plenty of research before making a decision, regardless of where on the planet you decide to place your order from.

				Im in UK and have not received quite of few of my domestic orders, whereas those from abroad seem to arrive OK apart from 1.<br />You somehow think that ordering from someone in the same country as you is safer ... but I&#039;m not convinced. Then again there&#039;s maybe another side to this story ... :-\
