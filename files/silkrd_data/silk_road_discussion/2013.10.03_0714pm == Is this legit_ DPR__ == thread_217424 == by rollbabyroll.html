Those forums could also be fake, I don&#039;t know how to find out whether they are or not though, other than asking if anyone here possibly knows.

What really matters here is if that URL is a legitimate backup, or just a fake backup... I don&#039;t think DPR would have made a backup without making an account there himself beforehand.

				Someone made that backup forum today, there&#039;s a thread about it somewhere. It&#039;s completely unofficial.

				It&#039;s not fake, someone made it as a backup site for communication when these forums go down. It&#039;s simply just a forum with an identical layout and a misleading name. If I still had the thread open I would link it.
