				PLEASE, mods, admins/DPR: vendor &quot;good at business&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/83a46a6a80&nbsp; is making threats, off his rocker, attempting FE scam/scam in progress, holding orders back, refuses any communication on SR. <br /><br />Please look into this disturbed&nbsp; vendor for the safety/security of his customers caught up in his downward spiral.<br />He&#039;s either deeply disturbed or using this as a ruse to cut/run.<br /><br />He has multiple shipments marked as in transit for well over a week.<br />Opening with death threats on his vendor page,&nbsp; he announces that all orders must FE by noon Tues (tomorow) in order to be shipped. He says they may be canceled,&nbsp; but only via torchat which he is NEVER on and not everyone knows torchat.<br />This asshole clearly planned this out and is looking to cash by a FE early scam and crazy talk mixed with jibberish and lies about FH and SR security.<br /><br />He&#039;s forcing FE that didn&#039;t exist before. He&#039;s off his fucking rocker and making what apppears to be threats of harm.<br /><br />Please, anyone with pull bring this to the attention of DPR/admins immediately.<br />Theres no telling what he may do. I will not give into his demands to FE and noone should. <br />His accont should be disabled and customers refunded asap.<br /><br />Thank you<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/83a46a6a80<br /><br /><br />READ OR DIE!! BUT SERIOUSLY VERY STRINGENT POLICIES ENACTED UNTIL 8/19 AND YOU WILL ABSLUTELY NEED TO KNOW THEM BEFORE ORDEERING!!<br /><br />**Goddamn sonething feels wrong here so no more ESCROW orders will be taken after Tuesday and we will be gone with the wind by next weekend. We are not here to scam asmany others have but Tor was obviously compromised much more than everyone thinks... Im not gong into details but just a week r s after zero hour attacks some heavt hitters on most wanted list have been discovered as a result of tracing SR transactions. Admittedly anything conducted in cleartext could potebntially provide a trail but something happened with the virus we don&#039;t know about because SR has 100% been affected by this. I don&#039;t think it was hacked but I&#039;ve seen it written in black ink on a top 3 news station reported over a dozen indicted drug ofenders involved in the .tor project are facing federal charges of prison for no less than 5 years and upto life without... I can provide link to trusted buyers/ sellers in top 35%, also only buyers who can show their buyer stats to exceed 6months activity and a reasonable buyer stats which arem&#039;t confusingly abnormal... oh btw this is a precaution that would seem stupid and rue until you read about it urdelf, I&#039;m a basketcase but I&#039;m not deusional, I admittedly have to analyze every corner of a restaurant before I sit down so you can chalk me up as insane and I&#039;d respect your decison to do so....<br /><br /><br />With that said...<br /><br />- I am offering 15% refund to anyone who FE&#039;s<br />- Tuesday at 11:59pm all orders require FE BEFORE shipped. they will go in transit as soon as label prints, its your responsibility to finalize to receive actual shipment. (We hapily refund if you change ur mind before shipped but use torchat to catch us ASAP before mail goes out.<br /><br />- Friday 1159pm we will go into stealth and delete all listings<br /><br />- +/- 48 hours later we will cease existence on SR for good.<br /><br />We will stick around these next week available on torchat for 6-12 hours daily as a means of faster corespondance until we are confident all customers have been satisfied up to Tuesday at 500pm. Any stragglers after his point will be provided with a temporary link to our private message box or 100% full PGP only correspondance to potential resolutions we owe altough you will be an FE customer if ur still waiting at this timeline so post-wednesday orders would require trusting our morality and intention that we ultimately just want to get out of the game with people paid off and a clear conscience.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t believe this is truly our intention to fulfill oders then do not order anything beyond Tuesday and consider wenesday our official departure.I am a businessman meaning I analyze markets, this market (.tor based black exchanges) show major vulnerabilities in our ever changing political climate that present immediate dander to myself and similar vendors. I am stating an oppionon, you live your life how you feel comfortable but I know there are options everywhere waiting t be takes, this WAS a viable one and in my oppinion has ceased to be. This should not affect your decisions in any way; letting people inflyence you instead of personal reseach will result in at least half bullshit results from my experience so remember to choose your life&#039;s path based solely on your thoughts, morals, and findings... I am right now<br /><br /><br />08/09: Hey all I have orders thay were not turned in as a result of paranoia from malicious javascript attacks on tormail users and their effect on package deliveries. I&#039;m not worried about myself as I don&#039;t fit any of the profiles necessary to be expoted and have never executed ay processes by the given virus&#039; name. With that said, I still needed to make sure outstanding packages got delivered before I sent more out alongside confirmaton of customer safety which I now have. Anyway please note that many of you (less than 10) were marked in-transit when you were not in fact shipped but rather awaiting deployment in package. This was not malicious but rather a judgement call not to drop package off at last minute to ensure security but I mark my packages shpped as I head out to send mail usually. I&#039;m very sorry for the inconvenience but it is my nature to err on the side of caution when facing unknown threats and be prepared.<br /><br />A very impottant update to note is I am also redesigning shipping procedures to avoid package profiling while this subject is still hot and the investigative procedures aimed toward Vendors is still unknown. All packages are going out first class from here until 9/09/13 to assess safety of community over 30 days and all express packages have been downgraded to Priority. Also I will be in stealth very soon and doing $100+ bulk only so add me to your favorite list if you want to deal with me 2-3 weeks from now but I&#039;m slowing down with the unknown threat to SR in future. Who knows what will happen upon the analyzation of all users (or admin) who were infected, there&#039;s no way it didn&#039;t happen to 2% of the community as a very conservative estimate ad that&#039;s hundreds if not thousands of trails to track down. Basically I feel like if you got infected through failure to update Tor or disable Java then my assumption is that you probably didn&#039;t use PGP either. It&#039;s a new day for us here and the days of $20- $50 listings are soon going out the window as it&#039;s just not worth anymore it given the unknown variables and resulting customer vulnerability.<br /><br />Start the shitstorm now guys but I have to watch my ass first and foremost while you all know that I protect your anonimity in more ways than one. With no hubris intended I truly feel my security procedures help to insulate and provide plausible deniability to everyone moreso than easily 3/4 of all other vendors in this business. I&#039;ve ordered off SR but not more than a few times sadly after I saw how obviously my packages contained drugs or at bare minimum some shady ass product even though vendor was praised for stealth in all occasions, I trust me to analyze and decide what is right so I can&#039;t be rushed or persuaded to change anything, take it or leave it guys today is a new day.<br /><br /><br />08/06: ***OVERSTOCKED LIKE A MOFO ON FULL 900PC PAGES SO PRICE WILL DROP TO $75 ($0.04/UNIT) ON ETIZ AND $175 ($0.18/UNIT) ON 25C LISTINGS OF 900PCS UNTIL FRIDAY 8/9 11:59PM AS PART OF OUR &quot;WHOLESALE CUSTOMER&quot; APPRECIATION SALE!

				I&#039;ve had two orders processing from this guy for days now!&nbsp; One of them for three, and one for five.&nbsp; Each was for a sheet.<br /><br />Well today one of the sheets showed up.&nbsp; Also came with 39 extra tabs.&nbsp; Some of the best stealth I&#039;ve ever seen (one of few times I started getting angry thinking it wasn&#039;t even there).&nbsp; I&#039;m interested to see if the other sheet arrives.&nbsp; Either way, neither order was ever marked in transit, so I can already cancel one order and in twelve hours (roughly) I can cancel the other.<br /><br />I kinda feel weird about cancelling an order when I actually did receive product.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\
