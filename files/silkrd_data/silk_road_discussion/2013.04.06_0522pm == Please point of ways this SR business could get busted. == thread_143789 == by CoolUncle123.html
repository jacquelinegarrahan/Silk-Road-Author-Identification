				Hi,<br />SWIM created a Tormail account and emailed a bunch of people SWIM knows letting them know that SWIM could ship various substances in small quantities to them. SWIM told them to create a new email account and get in touch if they are interested. They would have to send SWIM bitcoins. SWIM even helped them figure out how to get BTC anonymously. SWIM will place orders for them on SR and charge a fee for the same. SWIM plans on using a SR account that is brand new. SWIM will require a reference from a reliable customer to take on new clients. SWIM will offer refunds and reships on a case by case basis. SWIM&#039;s country of operations has very lax customs. Basically SWIM&#039;s clientele don&#039;t know about SR and are pretty bad with tech in general. SWIM will place all orders using PGP and will only make small orders. No big deals. There is no real life contact between SWIM and the clients. SWIM will not be using encryption on SWIM&#039;s computer and SWIM uses this computer for other stuff. Can anyone think of a way SWIM could get busted?

				You know, it&#039;s never, ever a good idea to divulge that EXACT details of your business module over a public forum. You&#039;re better off sending some private PM&#039;s to refutable vendors...just my 2 coins.

				So, you are reselling Silk Road products?&nbsp; Middleman? <br />There is no profit margin for this, unless they are really desperate. <br /><br />There is already a site for this setup it&#039;s called TOR STORE .&nbsp; You can setup your own vendor site and re sell SR products.&nbsp; It has a cart and a escrow too.&nbsp; &nbsp;THe silk road vendors have no clue what&#039;s going on too.&nbsp; !&nbsp; <br /><br />You can team up with a sr vendor , or just represent many of them together without heir knowledge. Your customers visiting g your site just think its all your &#039;suppliers&#039; who are providing the pictures and details.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sound good?&nbsp; Do a search for tor store.&nbsp; &nbsp; $50. One time fee. <br />

				If theyre into buying drugs from you then they&#039;re probably interested in drugs(duh)<br />and if you only accept them to pay you in bitcoin, then they&#039;ll need to acquire BTC (duh)<br />so anyone who is a) interested in buying drugs and b) familiar enough to buy BTC<br />would mostly likely omit the middle man (you...i mean SWIY) and go directly to SR.<br /><br />I cant imagine why they would want to pay extra for you to do this when they have the currency and desire to<br />go directly to the source.

				No worries about self incrimination here as everyone is anonymous. The&nbsp; acronym &quot;swim&quot; doesn&#039;t really provide much protection anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure how profitable that will be but good luck.

				Remote Viewing is the only plausible way SR can get taken down. But they wont waste the time and resources to do it. If you dont know what RV is, you better find out. with RV, you can&#039;t hide.
