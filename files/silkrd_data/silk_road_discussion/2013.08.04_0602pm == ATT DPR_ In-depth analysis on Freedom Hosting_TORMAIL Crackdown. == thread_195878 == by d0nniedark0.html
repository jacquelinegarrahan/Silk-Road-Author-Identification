				&quot;BREAKING: HALF OF TOR SITES COMPROMISED, INCLUDING TORMAIL<br /><br />The founder of Freedom Hosting has been arrested in Ireland and is awaiting extradition to USA.<br /><br />In a crackdown that FBI claims to be about hunting down pedophiles, half of the onion sites in the TOR network has been compromised, including the e-mail counterpart of TOR deep web, TORmail.<br /><br />http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/fbi-bids-to-extradite-largest-childporn-dealer-on-planet-29469402.html<br /><br />This is undoubtedly a big blow to the TOR community, Crypto Anarchists, and more generally, to Internet anonymity. All of this happening during DEFCON.<br /><br />If you happen to use and account name and or password combinations that you have re used in the TOR deep web, change them NOW.<br /><br />Eric Eoin Marques who was arrested runs a company called Host Ultra Limited.<br /><br />http://www.solocheck.ie/Irish-Company/Host-Ultra-Limited-399806<br />http://www.hostultra.com/<br /><br />He has an account at WebHosting Talk forums.<br /><br />http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=157698<br /><br />A few days ago there were mass outages of Tor hidden services that predominantly effected Freedom Hosting websites.<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/ltj1j1j6v/<br /><br />&quot;Down for Maintenance<br />Sorry, This server is currently offline for maintenance. Please try again in a few hours.&quot;<br /><br />If you saw this while browsing Tor you went to an onion hosted by Freedom Hosting. The javascript exploit was injected into your browser if you had javascript enabled.<br /><br />What the exploit does:<br /><br />The JavaScript zero-day exploit that creates a unique cookie and sends a request to a random server that basically fingerprints your browser in some way, which is probably then correlated somewhere else since the cookie doesn&#039;t get deleted. Presumably it reports the victim&#039;s IP back to the FBI.<br /><br />An iframe is injected into FH-hosted sites:<br /><br />TOR/FREEDOM HOST COMPORMISED<br />By: a guest on Aug 3rd, 2013<br />http://pastebin.com/pmGEj9bV<br /><br />Which leads to this obfuscated code:<br /><br />Javascript Mozilla Pastebin<br />Posted by Anonymous on Sun 4th Aug 02:52<br />http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2776374<br /><br />FH STILL COMPROMISED<br />By: a guest on Aug 3rd, 2013<br />http://pastebin.com/K61QZpzb<br /><br />FBI Hidden Service in connection with the JavaScript exploit:<br />7ydnpplko5lbgfx5<br /><br />Who&#039;s affected Time scales:<br /><br />Anyone who accessed an FH site in the past two days with JavaScript enabled. Eric Eoin Marques was arrested on Sunday so that&#039;s the earliest possible date.<br /><br />&quot;In this paper we expose flaws both in the design and implementation of Torâ€™s hidden services that allow an attacker to measure the popularity of arbitrary hidden services, take down hidden services and deanonymize hidden services<br />Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization&quot;<br /><br />http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf<br /><br />The FBI Ran a Child Porn Site for Two Whole Weeks<br />http://gizmodo.com/why-the-fbi-ran-a-child-porn-site-for-two-whole-weeks-510247728<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/o4qaep8pz/<br /><br />On any other day one would say these sick perverts got what they deserved. Unfortunately the Feds are stepping far beyond just pedophiles in this latest issue.<br /><br />The js inserted at Freedom Hosting? Nothing really, just an iframe inject script with a UUID embedded server-side.<br /><br />The iframe then delivers an exploit kit that appears to be a JavaScript 0day leading to...something. It only attempts to exploit Firefox (17 and up) on Windows NT. There&#039;s definitely some heap spraying and some possible shell code. The suspect shell code block contains some strings that look to formulate an HTTP request, but I haven&#039;t been able to collect the final payload yet. The shell code also contains the UUID with which the exploit was delivered. Any UUID will work to get this part of the exploit.<br /><br />I&#039;m still pulling this little bundle of malware apart. So far, I&#039;ve got that the attack is split across three separate files, each loaded into an iframe. Calls are made between the frames to further obfuscate the control flow. The &#039;content_2.html&#039; and &#039;content_3.html&#039; files are only served up if the request &quot;looks like&quot; Firefox and has a correct Referer header. The &#039;content_2.html&#039; is loaded from the main exploit iframe and in turn loads &#039;content_3.html&#039;.<br /><br />Short version. Preliminary analysis: This little thing probably CAN reach out without going through Tor. It appears to be exploiting the JavaScript runtime in Firefox to download something.<br /><br />UPDATE: The exploit only affects Firefox 17 and involves several JS heap-sprays. Note that the current Extended Support Release is Firefox 17, so this may also affect some large organizations using Firefox ESR.<br /><br />http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2777139<br /><br />The script will only attempt the exploit on Firefox 17, so I&#039;m no longer worried about it being some new 0day. Enough of the &quot;Critical&quot; MFSAs are for various sorts of memory corruption that I don&#039;t have the time to find out if this is actually a new exploit or something seen before.<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/mb66vvjsh/<br /><br />Logical outcomes from this?<br /><br />1. FBI/NSA just shut down the #1 biggest hosting site and #1 most wanted person on Tor<br /><br />2. Silkroad is next on their list, being the #2 most wanted (#1 was Child Porn, #2 is drugs)<br /><br />3. Bitcoin and all crypto currenecies set to absolutely CRASH as a result since the feds can not completely control this currency as they please.<br /><br />I don&#039;t always call the Feds agenda transparent, but when i do, I say they can be trying harder.&quot;<br /><br />source: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rlo0uu<br /><br />

				First of all +1, and thank you for taking the time to put that together, It&#039;s people like you who keep the community thriving. <br />Well at least it isnt some NSA newely created virus, I suppose the injection is expected to be on FBI level skills. Now hang on, Im no technical expert, But does this mean the exploit would not work if you were using tails? <br />This points out to me the feds went back to square one, They literally went to the tor website and looked at how to stay safe. The bit on the website that tells you Tor keeps you good for the most part but you need to do certain things (use it right) otherwise you may as well be using google chrome with no proxy. <br /><br />One of them happens to be keep javascript disabled, as this can reveal your IP, They may well use another famous one like dont download files in tor, Say become a vendor sell useless PDF&#039;s and get everyone to download it, i reckon half would not do it offline in a VM and would reveal their IP. I actually think TBB and tails comes with javascript auto disabled is this not right?

				How does this play out for those of us using the TOR browser bundle, I believe the no script plug in is installed by default and warns you to allow javascript on a case by case basis.<br /><br />Just wondering can anyone confirm anything since I guess its one of the most popular avenues onto TOR&nbsp;

				You know, this is what I hated most about accessing SR and Tor...somehow being associated with fucking pedos.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always thought it would simply be a very remote possibility since I only used Tor to access SR and the forums but it never occurred to me (cause I&#039;m a fucking moron)&nbsp; that when I was viewing bud porn photos I was accessing an onion image service that apparently pedos were using as well.<br /><br />Now, although I had Noscript set to forbid JS globally, I didn&#039;t have IFRAME disbled (never even heard of that before yesterday) and I did try to view some old bud porn links recently, from qwerfdsa, and now here I am, fucking pissed off because I may or may not be infected.<br /><br />But my only fear of being merely associated with pedos even though I&#039;ve never fucking viewed CP but may or may not have been caught accessing a service used by them.<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly certain I have nothing to worry about but just the mere possible association with that kind of depravity and ugliness is bothersome.<br /><br />edit: it just occurred to me that it wasn&#039;t a maintenance message but a server unavailable/network problem&nbsp; type message (like a white page with simple font text and maybe a horizontal line near the top, very generic looking).&nbsp; Does anyone know if the infected maintenance page was more elaborate?&nbsp; I just assumed the maintenance page was the same as the &#039;unavailable&#039; page I used to get every so often.

				Right ok, Hang on, I use tails, Am i still traceable if i was hit? Im not sure i was hit, But just to be sure. When i checked there, The fucking disable scripts part was not turned on or off actually i had to select it, However i know for a fact that im never able to watch videos or anything like that anyway, I thought tails turned it off automatically. Am i safe with tails? Or have i been hit. Can someone please put it in black and white :) thanks all.<br /><br />And Blackiris, How does it only take a minute?

				It APPEARS that anyone using a non-windows system has nothing to worry about.&nbsp; This includes tails and any other linux-based, or mac osx systems.&nbsp; The exploit has been reported to only work on the windows OS.&nbsp; While we cannot be sure this is the case, it does seem plausible.&nbsp; However, if the exploit does work on non-windows systems then using tails, etc. would likely not protect you from having your IP address discovered, as the IP provided by your ISP would be the same whether you use tails or not.<br /><br />I have done quite a bit of research on javascript and IP address discovery.&nbsp; There is no way that I have discovered to obtain your location&#039;s public IP address from javascript.&nbsp; All that (non-hacked) javascript has the capacity to do is report the private IP address of the local computer it is running on, which is useless to LE.&nbsp; Its clear that the FBI, or someone the FBI bought the exploit from (yes, the FBI buys shit off the black market too), has a way to do this.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know about public and private IP addresses, very basically, your home network behind your firewall (you do have a firewall right?) assigns private IP addresses (via dhcp) to all your computers beginning with either &quot;10.&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;192.&quot;.&nbsp; Any IP starting with those numbers is a private IP and is guaranteed to be unique ONLY within your home network.&nbsp; The public IP is the IP your internet service provider assigns to your cable/dsl modem.&nbsp; This is the IP address that appears to websites when you access sites via clearnet or without a VPN or other obfuscating proxy.&nbsp; All your home network computers share this IP to talk to the internet.&nbsp; This is the IP that LE wants to get.&nbsp; Generally, javascript running in a browser on your computer only has access to your private IP which, again, is useless to identify you on the public internet.&nbsp; However, you cannot rely on that as this FBI sting makes clear.&nbsp; As others have said already, DISABLE JAVASCRIPT COMPLETELY IN YOUR TORBROWSER SETTINGS TO HELP KEEP YOURSELF ANONYMOUS.

				Alright, so they got freedom hosting. The owner apparently had a history with child pornography. Illegal photographs were being hosted on freedom hosting&#039;s servers.. but they can&#039;t necessarily use that same tactic to shut SR down.. am I right? Yes, drugs are being sold here, but that doesn&#039;t give them any more than they already have to go after the company that hosts SR. Am I the only one who doesn&#039;t believe SR is next?

				Yes im sorry i think you are the only one. What they have proved here is that they can get at people who use the deepnet . <br />We have a problem because anyone who tried to access tormail will have been hit with this javascript injection. Now people are working on it clearly and taking apart the code and injection one by one, SO we will see soon enough what the extent of it is. <br />I think that FH was just allowing .onion sites to be hosted, I dont know if he directly was involved in CP or if it was just more of a &quot;He allowed them to be hosted , Hes as guilty as the people downloading them&quot; <br /><br />Either way, DPR surely you know some people who are well versed in the arts of programming and coding, Get them on it pronto. Your business and all of ours relies on it. In the meanwhile, everyone else technical great job so far. Good luck deciphering the rest of the scripting an coding. Hopefully this isnt a brand new NSA created virus, Just another FBI script.<br /><br />So your saying that even if disable scripts was off and i went to the tormail hidden service via tails, and of course the page didnt load , I am safe so long as tails was used?

				Somebody on Reddit says they tested the Javascript and it only revealed the IP of the TOR exit node.<br /><br />chris530 8 points 21 hours ago<br /><br />As a amateur security researcher, I was interested in the pastebin link which was posted. After reading the code, I was skeptical it would work. So I created a page which hosts the bad javascript code. Visited the link in cleartext. Got of ip as I was expecting. Spun up a VM, and installed torbrowser. ( non tails ) Got the ip from a tor exist node ( the js did run ) as expected. I do not see what you would gain putting this on a illegal websites besides the tor exit node ip.<br /><br />I could be missing something, of course. Those are my findings.

				First of all, yes all of the Tor Project software, from Tor Browser to Tails, ships with javascript enabled by default. If you didn&#039;t turn it off, then it is on. I always thought it was stupid for them to ship with javascript enabled by default, and maybe now they will wake up to this fact. <br /><br />Second of all, nobody has actually shown any proof that this guy who got busted is the owner of Freedom Hosting. It does look like he probably is, since he was busted running multiple websites hosting more than a million images of CP. On the other hand, there are busts of people running large websites with many images of CP on a fairly regular basis, just a few years ago there was a bust in Ukraine of people running dozens of CP pay sites with millions of images on them, but nobody jumped to the conclusion that it was freedom hosting at the time. On the other hand, in this case we just don&#039;t know the details of the operation, in the Ukraine case they talked about pay walls and paypal and etc, in this case we only know the very basic facts. Also it is a bit weird that the busted guy had funneled like half a million dollars through his bank account, that makes it sound like perhaps he was operating a for pay CP network, or maybe he is just some rich fuck who owns his own hosting company. Running a site like Freedom Hosting would probably require at least five hundred bucks a month, so since he did it for free he obviously was pretty well to do. So yeah it looks like Freedom Hosting admin was busted, but I have not seen any concrete evidence on this yet, and a lot of the stuff I am seeing about it looks like it is fresh from the asshole of Anonymous trying to scare everybody. Nobody in the news has linked Freedom Hosting to this busted guy, it has all been random fucks who seem to have no solid evidence that the person busted is freedom hosting admin. On the other hand, it looks like at least one person running a CP site on Freedom Hosting claims that they had javascript exploits injected into their site content, so that is certainly not a good sign. <br /><br />Also No Script shipped with Tor Browser has iframe enabled by default so I don&#039;t think it is going to protect anyone from this if it turns out to actually be real.

He was the wrong guy in their witch hunt but the information they collected I&#039;m sure was filed by the FBI.<br /><br />There is speculation of him running other deepweb services (I&#039;ve read he ran OnionBank? any confirmations on that?) and there is also mention of large amounts of money running through his own bank account which is unlikely to be from Freedom Hosting as his plans were all unmetered. He could have been taking under-the-table payments to keep CP sites online above normal fees, and that would leave a paper trail if the client had been caught or was under investigation - or if a client that paid him under the table was actually law enforcement. There&#039;s also a bit of focus on a transaction to Romania (6000 euros) from his own bank account, which he claims is investment in another business. It&#039;s been mentioned in a couple of threads the possibility of &quot;real life&quot; social engineering.<br /><br />It says the FBI has been investigating him for a year. He is also a US citizen, though living in Ireland since age 5 and the warrant is issued from Maryland.<br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t provide more info.<br /><br />ER.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think he was too stupid or anything, he had some of the best technical security of anyone in onionland and he has been running Freedom Hosting for quite a lot of years now with no issues. He also didn&#039;t charge anything for hosting anything. Also the person who is busted used his credit card to withdraw 6,000 Euro in romania but also sent about half a million dollars worth of Euros to Romania through his bank account.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I wonder how the FBI got permission to hack into arbitrary computers around the world. Viewing CP is not illegal in Russia for example, or most of Sourt America, or about half of the world. But in Russia and these other countries, it is illegal to hack into computers. So it seems to me like the FBI has violated the sovereignty of many countries and illegally hacked into the computers of non-criminals around the world.&nbsp;

				Admittedly I haven&#039;t been reading too in-depth about this stuff, but I have a question.<br /><br />If in the same browsing session/window I was logged into my SR account and in a separate tab also into a TorMail account that is used for everyday unrelated shit, is safety still something to be concerned about?

				Yep mainly IP address and MAC address and that&#039;s pretty much it. IP address is no big deal if you were running over a VPN and the MAC address just identifies the type of device. Here is what an expert who diagnosed it said:<br /><br />I only ran magneto and stepped through with OllyDbg in a VM.<br />I actually came across the IP, i just forgot to cast to sockaddr_in of the connect() call. The IP is: 65.222.202.54 and they used the port 5000. It makes 5 tries to connect.<br />Then it gets the hostname with gethostname().<br />Then it gets all the local IPs and associated hostnames with gethostbyname.<br />Since i have no network adapter, i dont know how all this info was used in the following.<br />Then it cooks cooks up a HTTP GET String with the UUID provided by the javascript as parameter and it appends the local hostname in the Host: field.<br />Then it tries to get the MAC-Adress with SendARP() and puts it in a cookie field named &quot;ID&quot;, which i faked the return to confirm.<br />Then it sends everything away with send().<br />And after that it even does a closesocket(). After that it probably tries to gracefully exit the shellcode somehow without crashing the target, i can&#039;t really tell.<br />Maybe i&#039;ll try to examine this in a real exploiting situation with all the javascript stuff and the vulnerable tor browser.

				I have nothing to contribute on the technical side here, so feel free to skip this comnent.<br /><br />Slightly unrelated, but on the &quot;relationship&quot; between Tor and CP, I always assumed this would be used by police when interrogating any suspected SR user.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We see you have been using Tor, like looking at pictures of child abuse do you?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No comment. Wheres my lawyer?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Do you know what they do to people like you in prison?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No comment. Lawyer&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(*lying now *)&quot;We have found some illegal images on your computer&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&quot;NOOO! I WAS JUST SELLING DRUGS! I SWEAR I&#039;M NOT A NONCE........shit&quot;<br /><br />Naturally I despise CP and those who use it. But the child porn accusation seems to be wheeled out often by authorities to justify some tyrannical behaviour.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was a case a few years ago where armed police kicked in the door of two brothers and shot one of them in the shoulder. All the headlines were &quot;TERRORIST BOMB FACTORY UNCOVERED&quot; (the brothers were Muslim of course). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the story progressed it became apparent that in fact they were completely innocent, and they were eventually completely exonerated and compensated. However I remember seeing stories (presumably leaked by police) in papers talking about &#039;finding child porn on their computers&#039;.<br />It seems to be something that just gets thrown out there in these situations.

In that case exploits as these will never work just because your IP is ToRified from the beginning. Probably the Whonix solution is the best (better than Tails in an home solution) to prevent exploits for trying to control your system or gather info about yourself through your machine.<br /><br />A VPN is fine, but you anyway have to rely on the VPN not giving out info about yourself and I never trust anybody with this, no matter what. The best ways imo are using Tails in public Wi-Fi accesses (random and changing) or a Whonix VM. This or a remote computer access in some Russia server or similar.

				No, because it can be a lot of things and it&#039;s impossible for me to say &quot;it can be this or that&quot; here.<br /><br />Most probably is nothing but it&#039;s always best to be paranoid than be sorry (some rootkits and similar are not discovered by AV in Windows and either in the case they are they will be much probably not cleaned correctly) so the right approach if you have some worry is always to erase and start anew. It doesn&#039;t take that much and it puts your mind at ease.<br /><br />Naturally when you re-install then go for better security or the problem can present itself anew.

				DBR, or anybody who is security conscious will not have JS enabled on Tor for any sites, also they would use linux, even use a text browser like lynx. So if they to attempt to grab low end users that browse the deepnet with JS enabled and use Windows with the most used bundle browser available out ther, it does not mean that SR or DBR is compromised in any way. It does mean that low hanging fruits will always fall from the tree.

				This is a good example of where using WiFi of a neighbor from home could protect you. There are a lot of people out there right now who know they are probably pwnt by the FBI. The ones who used a neighbors WiFi in addition to Tor have revealed their hostname, mac address and their neighbors IP address. If they destroy their networking card, wipe their drives and use a new hostname (and hopefully didn&#039;t name their computers after themselves to begin with) and stop using their neighbors WiFi (and probably stop using Tor from home themselves now), they are still not likely to be deanonymized. The people who used their own internet and fell victim to this attack are totally fucked. This is the unlinkability of using a neighbors WiFi that I was discussing in the past. They would be even better off if they used WiFi from a random location, then they would be safer to continue using Tor from home.

				So, first: Someone asked about emails that have been deleted being read. It depends - most email systems have a recycle bin type system, where you move mail to the trash and then it is deleted after a certain amount of time. It is only deleted if you specifically force it. I could go into the possibility of disk recovery, but chances are tormail does enough data writes to at least make that a little hard for the FBI to do.<br /><br />Javascript itself, as in, the language itself, has no ability what-so-ever to obtain an ip address, or any other information not available from the browser.<br /><br />However, and I want to be very, very clear on this: The internet itself, has methods for doing so. Every request you make, produces that information in the header requests. There are many sites on the web that do a very simple thing, displaying your public IP address (whatsmyip.org for example). The FBI need only set up a site that records that request when the javascript says hello. It&#039;s that simple. They&#039;ll know more too, unless you&#039;ve take the time to obfuscate your browser information. And, depending on how invasive the exploit was, they could also hijack the browser itself, examining information generated from the proxy connection that it makes to the tor client. This would take a lot of effort and is unlikely, but the former part is extremely easy - and its one of the easiest ways for a site to know you are coming from a TOR exit node.<br /><br />Most of that information is inconsequential though. It barely stands up in court for RIAA/MPAA lawsuits. The concept that an IP address makes any one person in a household guilty of anything is flimsy at best. The only time it matters, is in situations like tracking numbers - when you access a tracking number from TOR they don&#039;t need the IP. They know it was either the sender or the receiver that did it, and they&#039;ve got that info. Otherwise an IP address is as useless as tits on a bull.<br /><br />Now, the articles regarding the freedom hosting crackdown are all rather clear on the matter. The guy was operating a service that allowed the distribution of CP. That is a federal offense - just simply being that person who does that. It&#039;s trafficking.<br /><br />This is TOR. It was created BY a US agency that is far more notorious for clandestine invasions of privacy than the FBI - and if you think they don&#039;t know you from these forums or from SR you&#039;re being naive. TOR is one of those means to an end that the agencies allow. The reason is simple: because it allows them to catch the fucks like Eric Eoin Marques and prosecute them. It also allows them to catch terrorists and other persons of interest that would normally be invisible - and be very aware that they would be invisible. Bin Laden evaded for the length of time that he did because he was invisible - he didn&#039;t participate in anything that would have demonstrated his identity to any form of surveilance, even in the face of his neighbors. We are miniscule to this goal. Our presence is of value to them: because it hides them in the open. Determining information about the user behind a TOR connection is not impossible, and the ability to do so has been around in public hands for a while now... there is no reason why they wouldn&#039;t have it either.<br /><br />So, before we go conspiracy theory on this bitch, think about that. The FBI, the NSA and the CIA have had crap like this going on since before SR. It&#039;s naive to believe otherwise, and its stupid to act like you don&#039;t need to protect yourself from it. So, to say it a third or fourth time: If you operated believing TOR was the only protection you needed, that you were safe simply because you connected via TOR, then you were wrong. The documentation on TOR, on the website, and on the many many other discussions on TOR and personal security/privacy... here, and otherwise... says the same. <br /><br />Now, as for an answer on how to avoid things like this.<br /><br />First, these agencies are all dependant on one thing: money. They will not throw a ton of money to have 100% coverage - they will go for the largest base of evidentiary capture and hit that, as that is the most efficient thing to do. They&#039;ll usually also judge it by the availability of an exploit. Because of this, do yourself a favor... use a browser that isn&#039;t on that list. Use a browser that does not allow vectors like plugins and enhanced code. Use a browser that does not have all of the creative bells and whistles that make things look pretty. Become a minority and you reduce your chances of being a part of a funded group.<br /><br />Second, read the news. Stay informed. The worst thing you can do is stay oblivious to the happenings. This means speculating too.<br /><br />Third, be smart about what you do. Encrypt, destroy, don&#039;t record, do whatever it takes. Be prepared so when something does happen you don&#039;t have to be the one in this thread that is in a state of panic. If its truly that hard, don&#039;t use a permanent system to perform these tasks - use a live environment off a thumb drive or a DVD, like the few that have been mentioned on this thread and in the forums. Don&#039;t use a username that is easily associated to you in the real world. Don&#039;t use the same email username on tormail that you use elsewhere.<br /><br />Fourth, rely on others only if it is absolutely unavoidable. TorMail is not necessary for anything done here, nor is privnote. Be diligent and think before you do something. If a vendor doesn&#039;t give a method for encryption when they can&#039;t use PGP, then chances are you shouldn&#039;t use that vendor. Most of those vendors use TorChat as well - which is 1000x better than TorMail with OR without PGP.<br /><br />And last, if something happens out of the ordinary, it is better to err on the side of caution. Don&#039;t go back to that place. Erase it from your memory. Ignore it. Assume it has been compromised until you are told otherwise. If you followed the prior 4 steps, then this shouldn&#039;t be hard to do.<br /><br />

The goal should be wide ranging and effective in a short timeframe, while being effective on the cost to execute. That almost universally means windows. I would also suspect that they would at the very least look statistically at the relative chance that someone would be running the affected version. More often than not, a linux (or mac) user is statistically going to examine updates and execute them more often than on windows... this not only stems from an ignorance factor but also from a trust issue... windows update alone in the past has caused more trouble than its been worth. So, at the very least if I were making the decision, I&#039;d go after windows users.<br /><br />Also you make a really good point. The person who did this, or rather who designed this attack, planned for our speculation. Chances are they accomplished already what they wanted to accomplish - if an arrest hasn&#039;t been made, its incoming (or if a situation hasn&#039;t been handled, its close). If not, the situation was far worse than any of them thought.<br /><br />The articles that don&#039;t deal with the engineering side of this have pretty well spelled it out - this is a CP case. Anything else is probably irrelevant or at the very least collateral damage (or, for them, useful evidence that is useless to the case at hand).<br /><br />I would bet that they developed this with something specific in mind. Expanding from my windows inference earlier and the concept kmf established, chances are they already knew what the habits of the person(s) they were targeting were. As kmf said, its already pretty well known (and well accepted) that the majority of those on the tor network are using outdated software, and the majority of those users are also using prepackaged run-and-gun packages to get up and going as fast as possible. That in and of itself breeds in exploitation risk. At the very least, I don&#039;t lump the CP crowd in with particularly intelligent species... but necessity breeds invention, and they&#039;ve been requiring to hide for quite some time now. I would suspect that there is a rather specific core set of users, that are largely unaffected by this attack.. but their support structure was probably at least catalogued by it. That will eventually lead to the effective knowledge of the leaders... that is how we caught bin laden after all... communication between underlings.<br /><br />To be completely honest folks, while it is scary if they truly index the information on tormail related to SR type offenses, I would really just like to note that they took down freedom hosting for CP and, given that it was a rather large host, I will speculate they&#039;ve got their hands full.<br /><br />In the future, another recommendation with things like mail: if you want something anonymous, or at the very least in your control, use pop3 - imap as a protocol stores its messages on the server and pop3 does not. If you connect using pop3, all of the information on the server is gone. You can do as you wish with that data locally after that. Don&#039;t use the web panel.

				The core CP community will be completely unphased by this, they have been studying computer security for twenty+ years and are more likely to use OpenBSD or Qubes than they are to use Windows. Freedom Hosting was actually pretty secure from a technical perspective, it will be really interesting to see how they took it down. It is beyond a doubt the most secure CP site that has ever been compromised, by a huge margin. My guess is that the people fucking with CP are going to ditch Tor and I2P at this point and move entirely to Freenet, which is already the network with the most CP on it. Feds cannot really hack CP on Freenet to remove it, and they cannot really put exploit code on a site on Freenet. CP traders are much more secure to download image files off Freenet without ever using a browser, and then opening the files on computers without access to the internet. That is likely what the most skilled CP traders have been doing all along.

I have been to tormail in the past where the homepage from time to time was taken over by hacker groups. it goes back online shortly after that. ALSO.....<br /><br />if there is no real drives for tormail and nothing to access for info as it all sits on relays.. then how are the feds getting the info from our accounts?? hermm. <br />ALSO if its not even a server on US soil then why grab the fredom hosting guy and why the tormail guy.. Fuck... if this is the case y not go after google or c&amp;^cast cause those could be at fault as well..they are providing internet service to these people as well. U cant tell me EVERY C.P. person ONLY used tor and ONLY used FH.THEY have to be able to connect to the internet. SOMEWAY...just from those questions i am SURE there is a van of agents on the way for me but really there are too many holes here. ones that need to be rammed with a big fat non lubed thorny stick..

				Hold on a minute can someone please answer a really simple question:<br /><br />OK the S symbol in between the onion and the address bar on my Tor browser when I click on it, the second option down says &quot;allow scripts globally (dangerous)&quot; now am I correct in thinking that If I clicked on this the message would change to &quot;forbid scripts globally&quot; (i.e. the setting I now have it on)? But then when I go into the NoScript options embeddings tab the forbid java box is unchecked and also within the tor browser options content tab the Enable Javascript box is checked, which is the overriding setting here? Shouldn&#039;t it it be the forbid scripts globally option in NoScript that the browser was set up with as default?<br /><br />Also since I updated my Tor browser the last time (late June I think) I saw the exclamation mark over the onion next to the address bar (to v.17.0.7 - just checked) won&#039;t that mean that this attack won&#039;t affect me and if I keep on updating my browser as soon as I see the exclamation mark notification then I&#039;ll be immune from similar attacks in the future?

				Yeah, I have already read posts and heard personally from vendors who admitted to sending plaintext emails to their sources. This isn&#039;t just about buyers getting compromised re the BlueGiraffe fiasco, but vendor sources.

				Kinda feel like I&#039;m talking to myself here but I thought I could share something that might help relieve some people, since it did for me.&nbsp; I suspect that the majority of people here are predominantly worried over the potential tormail exposure (this doesn&#039;t help them in any way), but if there&#039;s any concern, as I was, about image links to an FH server from here, it looks to be OK.<br /><br />After some light digging, I discovered something that was totally unknown to me but maybe common knowledge to most everyone else.&nbsp; FH operated on an invite/pay system (is this correct?).&nbsp; It then occurred to me that it was unlikely that bud reviewers would be using a pay/invite image uploading service.<br /><br />In any case, I found a site that listed all onion sites that went down during the rumored FBI take down ( I say all but there&#039;s no way, at least for me, to determine if it&#039;s exhaustive or accurate, and there is one glaring omission, tormail.)&nbsp; But I could only find one image uploading service on that list, and a search here on the forums for that domain name came up empty so there actually might not be any FH bud porn image links here.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/2013/08/05/freedom-hosting-tor-website-list-tangodown/<br /><br />
