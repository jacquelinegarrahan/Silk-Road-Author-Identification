				Ok here is my rant<br />Today I had SR Resolution give a slimmy buyer a full 100% refund for a parcel that was delivered and admitted to the delivery by the slimmy buyer Finn The Humin he said he received the parcel 8 days before resolution refunded his COINS.What the fuck is up with that a completed delivery means that your are SUPPOSED to be paid not giving a Kick in the teeth and then your sales refunded because he says he doesn&#039;t know how to use the product<br /><br />THIS IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT so watch out VENDORS you maybe be next

				I don&#039;t believe that SR Support would give a 100% refund unless they felt there was justification for doing so, or unless they didn&#039;t have all the facts.<br /><br />Why was the buyer asking for a refund?&nbsp; I mean, was he asking for a refund due to some supposed flaw in your product, or was he asking for a refund due to not receiving it?&nbsp; If he was asking for a refund because he didn&#039;t receive the product, then, yeah, I&#039;d be confused about the refund and might try contacting SR Support to ask them about it again.&nbsp; If he was asking for a refund because he received it but didn&#039;t find it acceptable, then that&#039;s another issue completely.

				Hey scout<br />well here it what you don&#039;t understand as a seller when parcels are received they automaticially have to pay the vendor ANY other problem with the product is done threw FEED BACK once a parcel arrives your obligation is fulfilled I can not be there to show then how to use it so I supply a youtube link for new buyers MORE THAN ANY other vendor does. Again if a buyer is not happy with his purchase he has FEEDBACK to serve his ratings of the product &amp; vendor.<br /><br />there is no SPECIAL circumstance that allows refunds like this IF SO I should demand refunds for all my orders just because I can Bullshit no one else would except the SPECIAL circumstance and I won&#039;t either this shows that SR is SLIPPING when DPR allows his SR Resolution team to do this

				well I feel I will be looking for new sites as this is a joke when delivery is made then SR rules state that there is no REFUND because you don&#039;t like the product.I guess SNUJ &amp; BMR&nbsp; might be up for a new vendor hope there is is some sanity there as SR has lost all my faith of being a fair and just site.I will be a member here till it closes but I will be doing less business also

				Have you not noticed the huge growth this place has seen over the past few months? I imagine DPR can&#039;t just hire any person off the street for customer support and is probably over working his staff. Give them time to catch up to the demand you already know this place isn&#039;t your average site and should expect some hang ups along the way.

				they received the parcel 8days before res ran out they disputed the product saying it tastes funny they have never smoked oil ( I assume ) they were told ways to use it and then demanded their money back because of taste.The taste has nothing to do with the sale they have to pay for the parcel IT WAS DELIVERED as for taste they have the right to screw up my FEEDBACK

I agree with you there. However, there is NO way a buyer has to pay for something if there is a dispute! Yes, it may have been delivered but just because I received an order doesn&#039;t mean I have to pay for something which may very well be complete and utter shit. Otherwise a vendor could potentially send out periodically some cheap shit gear he may have knowing regardless of the buyer&#039;s opinion, he still has to pay. Pleeeeease! I&#039;m not accusing anyone of anything, merely pointing out that your wrong to believe that just because I receive a package, I have to pay for it regardless of what has arrived. My feedback is in no way a form of compensation should this ever happen to me. That&#039;s a ridiculous way to think. As previously posted, you keep claiming it was delivered but did you produce any evidence to SR to disprove any claims to the contrary made by the buyer? It seems you haven&#039;t provided any evidence to substantiate any of your claims against the buyer. I can&#039;t see them giving a buyer a 100% refund if you had any proof which contradicts their story. That just doesn&#039;t make any sense at all.

				Ya vendors could send out empty packages. But then they will definitely be getting some pretty shitty feedback. After enough empty packages sent, your feedback would drop so low that no one will want to buy from you.<br /><br />I agree with BigBill. That is what the feedback is for.
