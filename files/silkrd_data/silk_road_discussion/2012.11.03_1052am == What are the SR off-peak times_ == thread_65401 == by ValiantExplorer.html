				So we&#039;ve been advised to use SR during off-peak times, when possible.<br /><br />The question is: what ARE the off-peak times. I guess SR is mostly use in Europe and the USA, so that leaves very little wiggle room.

				@drugfather: Oh, I know what off-peak times ARE. But the thing is that since SR covers two very wide timezones (Europe, USA), it&#039;s hard to have such hours. Peak hours in Europe &amp; USA almost go one after the other, with the ebb and flow around them of +/- 1 hour, it&#039;s hard to wiggle, that&#039;s what I meant.<br /><br />BTW, what&#039;s that formula in your avatar? :)

				I&#039;m from Australia, and I find that if I log in between 7am - 3pm Australia time (9pm - 5am GMT), it is MUCH faster than if I try and use access SR in the evening. I assume most of the SR users are from Europe / North America, so this would explain why. They are sleeping when I am on SR :-)<br /><br />But I have only managed to log in once in the last five days, no matter what time of day I try and access it.<br />Hopefully it&#039;s back ASAP

				probably best if you dont just sit there and flood the server with attempts <br /><br />although one should not give up with one try, dont sit there just trying over and over and over<br /><br />recommend to try, if it doesnt load then click new identity and try again - if you have done this a couple times without success, then give it a rest <br /><br />wait for ten or fifteen min, go smoke a bowl or something then come back and try again -&nbsp; i almost always can get on pretty quickly<br /><br />that way you dont overload the server when its already too busy and it helps everyone be able to get on

				The Forum has also been working very sluggishly today. And indeed, it&#039;s better to give it a rest after 3-4 attempts. But sometimes it&#039;s like a turn based strategy game :D.&nbsp; You just need to press the refresh button one more time :D.
