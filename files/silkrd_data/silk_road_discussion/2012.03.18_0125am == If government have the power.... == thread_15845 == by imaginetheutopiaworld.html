				Using tor the communication between you (the client) and the website (the server) is encrypted, but also the encryption is used so the server doesn&#039;t know where you are and the other way around (you don&#039;t know where the server is). You don&#039;t know it, but the government doesn&#039;t know either. This should be slightly nuanced, but I think this is a good starting point in understanding how this work.<br /><br />If you&#039;re safe or not, depends highly on what you do. Your security is not really based on technology, but more on what you do. Most fuck ups will be from errors made by the user, not because the technology is insecure.

Anything that gives away your identity, like making your real name public. Or by not blocking scripts that can record your real IP (using java, for instance). Anything that links your ID from a clearnet site to an illicit hidden site (by transferring bitcoins directly from a exchange to SR, for instance) would be pretty stupid too.

				Chill out dude.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t totally screwed.&nbsp; Your probably just a &quot;small time buyer&quot; and the feds are that interested in small time buyers.&nbsp; Probably the most that would happen to you would be to have your exchange lock your account down for suspected money laundering.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just stop doing it.<br /><br />I find it best to go from my exchange -&gt; bitinstant -&gt; bitcoinfog -&gt; SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bitcoinfog is a bitcoin mixer.&nbsp; Makes it very difficult to track where your coins are going.&nbsp; They throw all your coins and others coins into a big pot and move them around in different denominations before sending them on to their destination.&nbsp; Takes an additional six hours but, it gives you a good feeling of safety.

				I understood that Silk Road uses a system similar to bitfrog&#039;s to try and make life harder for those analysing where the money&#039;s going to<br /><br />The following is quite possible: the address you send coins to on the Road isn&#039;t necessarily the actual address the coins are residing at once they&#039;re in your Silk Road account. It could be ANY ADDRESS. Your Silk Road addresses are only what&#039;s used to get the money into your account. <br /><br />I&#039;d quite like some official clarification on this at some point (not every single detail obviously, but it would be nice to know that at the very least, Silk Road&#039;s tumbling/obfuscation mechanism starts with bitcoin addresses OUTSIDE of the Tor network) <br /><br /><br />Anyway, the king of RL excuses when it comes to this is any variation of &quot;I sold bitcoins to a stranger&quot;. No one can fuck with that excuse

				Three of the most important things you can do, in my opinion:<br /><br />1) Use an encrypted USB drive to access the Road.&nbsp; Liberte, TAILS, your favorite Linux distro...&nbsp; Whatever your preference.&nbsp; ONLY use that drive for accessing the Road.&nbsp; Do NOT USE THE TOR BROWSER BUNDLE DIRECTLY FROM YOUR COMPUTER&nbsp; Do not allow ANYTHING Silk Road related to be written to your computer, only the USB drive.&nbsp; Do not ever get lazy and break this rule.<br /><br />2) Do not EVER sign for a package.&nbsp; Have packages sent to some form of your name that you&#039;ll immediately recognize as Road related-&nbsp; For example, if your name is John Smith, have them sent to J. Smith.&nbsp; If ever you are asked to sign for a package addressed to J. Smith, you&#039;ll know.&nbsp; Refuse.<br /><br />3) Other than sending your address, encrypted, when placing an order with a vendor...&nbsp; Do not EVER link ANYTHING having to do with your real identity to your Silk Road activity.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; Do you have a tormail email address?&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Don&#039;t send yourself test emails to and from your normal, everyday email address.&nbsp; Do not email your buddies from this address to tell them how cool it all is.&nbsp; Keep it separate and isolated.<br /><br />IF you should ever encounter a problem, and have to deal with LE, you do not want them to be able to corroborate ANYTHING.&nbsp; You were sent a package.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t request it.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t know it was coming.&nbsp; You don&#039;t know who sent it, or why.&nbsp; Say nothing, because you know nothing.&nbsp; As long as nothing else can tie you to that delivery, it is highly unlikely that a case can be made against you.<br /><br />In addition:<br /><br />Relax, have fun, and choose your vendors wisely.<br /><br />Please, please, please...&nbsp; Learn the etiquette of the Road.&nbsp; If there&#039;s a problem, try working it out with your vendor BEFORE plastering it all over the forums.<br /><br />Reserve using the words &quot;scam&quot; &quot;scammer&quot; and &quot;scammed&quot; until you have PROVED it to be the case<br /><br />The experience of postal joy is as addictive as any opiate.
