			<dd class="postbody">
				We&#039;d like to introduce ourselves. This new vendor account, the SR Gaming Commission, is a partnership of vendors joining together to bring a collection of high-stakes, high-payout games of chance to Silk Road. With our pooled resources and bankroll, we will be able to offer better odds and better payouts on our games than any solo vendor.<br /><br />This first few weeks will be a bit of a beta test as we gauge demand for what the SR community wants in gaming. We intend to offer fun games, with real competition. We currently offer three games of chance, two of which offer 10BTC payouts (but we will soon far exceed this with 100BTC and 500BTC payouts).<br /><br />What&#039;s in store:<br />• More games, including games of skill<br />• 100 BTC and 500 BTC payouts on select games<br />• Automated payout bot for truly INSTANT payouts<br />• And more.<br /><br />All of our games utilize the Silk Road transaction id hash in order to ensure provable randomness, fairness and instantaneous results (thanks, eddie!).<br />We also operate exclusively through SR escrow and in-system BTC transfer so that SR Dispute Resolution can guarantee we pay all winners.<br /><br />To celebrate our grand opening, the first 5 customers in EACH game will all get one free play (one ticket price credited to users SR account).<br /><br />SRGC Real Roulette - 1 in 255 Wins 10฿ Instantly | http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e2693a922c<br />SRGC Super Slots - Three 7s Wins 10฿ Instantly | http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b2f389b13b<br />SRGC Lucky Lotto - 1 in 16 Odds to Win 2฿ Instantly | http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6859e2fd0d<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Agent Lee<br />Agent Wintermute<br />Agent Sickboy

				Meh, it&#039;s a couple bucks to play. Obviously don&#039;t spend all your money, and if you can&#039;t handle these kinds of games, don&#039;t play.<br /><br />I wonder if a time stamp is included in the transaction hash. If it is, submitting multiple plays at once will lower the randomness.

				So after buying on the road for a year now suppose it&#039;s time to make my first forum post to let everyone know my experience with the sr gaming commission:<br /><br />I saw this thread and thought what the hell had since change leftover why not try my luck? Played the bingo and lost but was credited for a free play so I switched and tried the roulette and sure enough three 7&#039;s! I received a message within minutes congratulating me and saying my 10 coins were in their way and within 5 or so minutes my account wad credited.<br /><br />So time for me to go shopping.&nbsp; ;D

				Fascinating: of the six transactions I have access to, none have a single 7 in them.&nbsp; The odds of that are... 16^10 possibles with 7s included, and 15^10 possibles with no 7s included.&nbsp; So that&#039;s what, 15^10 / 16^10 = 0.52 chance of having no 7s per transaction.&nbsp; 0.52^6 (six transactions, each with a .52 chance of happening, so the chance they all happen is 0.52 to the sixth power, right?)<br /><br />... did I get that right, or did I fuck it up?&nbsp; Well assuming I&#039;m right, there&#039;s a 2% chance that given six uniformly random 10 digit hex strings, they&#039;d all have no 7s.&nbsp; Sorry to poke holes in your game (and to be clear I&#039;m only talking about the 7s), but something tells me that because of the algorithm generating these transaction IDs, it&#039;s a lot less likely than 1 in 50 somebody&#039;s gonna win.

I&#039;m just keeping that knowledge at the fore-front of our interactions, that&#039;s all. CrazyBart, by his own words, changed the feedback because of your messages, and not in a good way.

				I see who i&#039;ll be betting with next time. i mean cummon 45 bucks.. supposedly its cuz everyone who loses keeps their losing transaction in escrow. But seems like people wouldn&#039;t fuck up their auto-finilazation rates over a 1.19 listing.
