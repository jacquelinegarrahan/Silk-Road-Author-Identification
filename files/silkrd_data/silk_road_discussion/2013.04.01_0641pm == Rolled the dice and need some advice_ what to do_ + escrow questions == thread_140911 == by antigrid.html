				*UPDATE* <br /><br />I just wanted to update and let you all know that I have received tracking number, and it works. He has also replied to all my messages, but answers to some questions were not clear.&nbsp; But by no means am I saying something one way or the other, but I want all the facts to be in here, especially since potential buyers may view this thread. <br /><br /><br />I need some advice and have a few questions. I placed an order (large one) with a new vendor, here is a link to his profile:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/dac6cbb044<br /><br />We went back and forth for two days working out a deal for a better price since I wanted to purchase a good amount of pills. He seems genuine and straight up , but as I know from experience and some of you from experiences on SR, that doesn&#039;t mean I have nothing to worry about. I have perfect stats, $19k spent and over 60 transactions, with 0% refund/auto-finalize, but I am very nervous.&nbsp; He goes on vacation tomorrow from the 2nd to the 20th so I don&#039;t know what to think.<br /><br />First, before anything, he had one very bad feedback that started out as &quot;BUYER BEWARE&quot;, a guy said that he placed an order, was asked to finalize early and he did not then the order was cancelled without explanation??? I refreshed my browser over and over again to make sure but yep, only 4 feedbacks and he had 100% positive feedback. Now he has deleted that feedback and its still 100%. How is this possible? and what do you guys think? I asked him about it and he said that the guy never FE and he has all of his money, but I know from making many purchases on SR that you cannot leave feedback if you don&#039;t finalize, so now I am real nervous. By the way I did not finalize and was not asked to.<br /><br />The person mentioned in the feedback that the use of the words &quot;this man&quot; in two of the feedbacks makes him think it&#039;s fake. <br /><br />What should I do in this situation? I am afraid that all my $ will be tied up for weeks and it&#039;s all my money I have right now. I am afraid of being stuck in withdrawals for weeks because of this. If all goes well I will let everyone know for sure. I have never gone through the resolution process before and hope I never have to. Feel free to PM me <br /><br />

				That&#039;s a seriously sketchy looking account.<br /><br />1) Fakest feedback I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />2) Brand new vendor asking for FE (that&#039;s a violation of SR rules for a reason)<br />3) Only been a vendor for six days and he&#039;s going on vacation? Then going stealth? Riiiiiight.<br />4) Only has expensive item listings. He only has to get 2 suckers to FE in order to exceed the $500 vendors fee and turn a profit.<br />5) Opiates.<br /><br />This has scam written all over it.<br />But if you stay in escrow the worst that&#039;ll happen is your funds are tied up for 3 weeks or so.<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d be expecting some frantic messages from him pretty soon, highly suggesting you need to finalize early in order to get your product.

I messaged him and told him that its obvious he has never purchased on SR because he said the guy that left that feedback has his money and did not FE, and you can&#039;t leave feedback without finalizing. I hope he actually has the product. &#039;<br /><br />How did I miss this? I am such an idiot. I have never made a mistake like this before.&nbsp; He was very convincing if he is lying, in his messages at least. He told me the lowest he could go was $15 / pill and one message said &quot;Maybe you&#039;re better off sticking with three (the vendor)&quot;. But I usually don&#039;t gamble with so much $ because of my condition I need to be able to pay my health ins (and other bills). If this is a scam I am really fucked<br /><br />I also asked him if he could please cancel one of the two orders (I have one order for 10 pills and one for 30) so that I at least don&#039;t have all my money tied up and I can order from someone else too. I have an extremely painful condition so when I withdrawal it&#039;s not just that, that gets bad. He has not responded and I sent it hours ago.<br /><br />Help! can I stop this before they get tied up for three weeks? Or at least one of the orders? I just realized his date that he&#039;s coming back is almost exactly 3 weeks from yesterday. This kind of stress hurts my insides (where my condition is).

				Not much to do but wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bad it happen to me a while back.&nbsp; Now I keep my funds managed a little better with some extra in case it gets tied up like this.&nbsp; Yu can keep two streams of money , if you can save up.&nbsp; SR really taught me how to be patient and manage my drug money very well . <br /><br />It&#039;s getting hard to tell a good vendor for the first time.&nbsp; I stick to tried and true ones now rather than shop around for a deal.&nbsp; It&#039;s better to pay a few extra bucks to get a good vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like someone already said, I bet he sends the franticessage to you about some emergency that came up. Yadda yadda , <br /><br />&nbsp;I hope this helps.<br /><br />

				Oh yea,<br /><br />There Are vendor accounts for sale on the deep web.&nbsp; Complete with feedback already entered in and everything.&nbsp; A trusty vendor in a box for sale to any scammer with the cash.&nbsp; <br /><br />They even have like 300 transactions too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sucks. <br /><br /><br />They should make vendor accounts a recurring monthly fee instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;This way, they can keep tabs on shill and questionable accounts.
