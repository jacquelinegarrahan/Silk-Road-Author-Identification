				SWIM ordered some DMT and USPS failed to drop a LETTER sized item into my mailbox.<br /><br />This worries me. I was left a notice to come pick it up, or have it redelivered.<br /><br />I have the option of picking it up today at the post office, but there is no way in hell I&#039;m showing them ID.<br /><br />I am going to opt to have it redelivered. Although I&#039;m sure the notice is because it&#039;s Registered Mail, but no <br /><br />signature is required. WTF? Again it&#039;s letter sized. They could have put it in my goddamn mailbox.<br /><br />Weird right? Fuck going to the post office, get it redelivered. Am I thinking straight here? SWIM only <br /><br />ordered 200mg of DMT, and the vendor is KNOWN for discreet packaging.<br /><br />Talk to me peeps<br /><br />L75

				Weird that you have to go pick it up, when there was no sig required...PM the seller and see what they think? This doesn&#039;t make much sense to me.

				Don&#039;t do it. Kinda risky for 200mg. It&#039;s a shame losing money and DMT, yes, but you can always recover that.<br /><br />Peace and Love

				So I leave the notice for re-delivery which is essentially the same notice they leave when failing to deliver....<br /><br />My mailman hands me my mail and all grumpy goes &quot;Whats this&quot;? Like he had never seen it before.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m off tomorrow&quot; My response was &quot;No problem man, you can deliver it anytime this week&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh&quot; &quot;Ok&quot;<br /><br />and walks away grumpy x2.<br /><br />LOL!!! my paranoia just turned into what I had resting on the back burner....USPS Tardcenter Apes At Work.<br /><br />Update when it&#039;s finally delivered; I guess the moral of this is don&#039;t sign for shit -<br /><br />and don&#039;t go to the post office. Use that &quot;redeliver&quot; checkbox and move on<br /><br />Thanks for your input everyone :)<br /><br />L75

				I also had this trouble. I went into the post office to collect an unknown package (i have a couple buys off eBay waiting to be delivered) that i had to sign for. It turned out to be some DMT that had been opened by customs, I&#039;m not sure why they couldn&#039;t have delivered it to the mailbox so I&#039;m slightly worried. I wont be going and signing for anything anymore without proper inspection before they hand it over.

Was your parcel registered mail?<br /><br />I spoke to the post office on the phone without revealing information - here&#039;s what I got -<br /><br />&quot;registered mail must be delivered to a destination where the recipient is present&quot;.<br /><br />No signature required. (If you go to the post office, you will have to sign, DONT GO).<br /><br />While I don&#039;t like that, and sellers should list this as a possibility when shipping to US -<br /><br />I did return the slip to my mailman, who will redeliver it today. Hopefully he doesn&#039;t deliver me a love letter.<br /><br />My update will come shortly.<br /><br />L75

He is only trying to make it <br /><br />safe for both of us, but again - this is a speed bump.<br /><br />Updates within a few hours....If you don&#039;t hear from me it&#039;s because I&#039;m tripping on DMT<br /><br />L75

				ALL IS GOOD.<br /><br />Untouched package was delivered as i requested by my semi-retarded mailman.<br /><br />No signature required. Packaging is ingenious by my seller - and the dmt is being loaded into the Ubie now.<br /><br />BLAST OFF, BYE BYE.<br /><br />For reference, Registered Mail does NOT require a signature, but YOU HAVE to be there.<br /><br />I cannot point a finger at the vendor as he is just making sure of delivery.<br /><br />Just NEVER go to the post office. Opt to have it redelivered.<br /><br />peace and be safe everyone<br /><br />L75
