				Hi Noble,<br />&nbsp;I am new too. I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t answer your question but I would also like to know. <br /><br />Also noble, could you please let me know if your orders come through. I&#039;m about to put in my first order today. I found a good older source I feel good ordering through. I&#039;m not too worried, I&#039;ve done a good bit of research.

				The vendor has to mark &quot;in transit&quot; and then you ll be able to finalize.<br />Don&#039;t do it if you re not comfortable with the seller and the amount of money, research him on the forums if you haven&#039;t done that already.

				What acider said; when the vendor mails the package out, the FE button should be selectable.

				Noblesavage, just wondering, why do you want to Finalize Early? If you are a new user trying out a vendor for the first time, I would not recommend this. I&#039;ve only FE&#039;d in rare cases where I had a great relationship with the vendor (after multiple transactions over multiple months).&nbsp;

				Something else to note is that if a vendor has less than 35 transactions you cannot finalize until 3 days after your item has been marked in transit. I would recommend however that you go with a vendor that does not request FE for orders.<br /><br />Escrow is there for your protection; use it!<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I know you have the answer to your question but I just also wanted to say don&#039;t F.E. Even if you are a new buyer there are legit vendors that will allow new customers to stay in escrow. I know going through all the vendors and reading their pages etc is a pain but I recommend trying to always stay in escrow, it&#039;s a good practice to get in to. Granted it was a year ago but I managed to do all my transactions in escrow.<br /><br />Do a little research and save the risk :)<br /><br />(That said, many vendors that want you to F.E. are genuine and will deliver your goods, but better to be safe than sorry!)<br /><br />Have fun! :)
