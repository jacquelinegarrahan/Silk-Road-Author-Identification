				Except it&#039;s not and the buyer can just chargeback and get the BTC for free since Papal/eBay doesn&#039;t allow the selling of Bitcoins. The seller might even end up with their eBay and Paypal accounts permanently banned after the first transaction. You should change the title to &quot;the WORST scam ever&quot;.

				I don&#039;t think so: buyers value their *own* reputations on ebay, and aren&#039;t about to thro them away for that...and sellers can set limits on who they will sell to...many people have bought btc on ebay, if we were in a bind, and needed them right at that time...I noticed a bunch of them got sold when SR came back up, haha...price went thru the roof for a couple days: up to averaging 30bucks 1btc...for &#039;but it now&#039;&nbsp; ... but sellers and buyers both on ebay have reps to guard, and you can&#039;t just go around reneging on deals, or ebay would have fallen apart a long time ago...not just btc, but you could say that about *anything*: that it didnt arrive, etc...<br /><br />The btc sales are same as the old loan sharks...if u needed the money, u&#039;d pay the price...people had cash, and the only surefire way to get btc immediately was thru ebay :)&nbsp; and u can buy them no problem with paypal...look back on those transactions and the feedback: most seemed happy, no rips...
