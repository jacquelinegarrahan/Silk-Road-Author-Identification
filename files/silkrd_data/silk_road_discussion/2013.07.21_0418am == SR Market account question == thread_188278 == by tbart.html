				okay, made two purchases today, both small ones, to try the system out<br />just noticed, there&#039;s only half the amount of my two purchases total showing in escrow<br />and one of the purchases wasn&#039;t &quot;hedged&quot; (ie showed &quot;unhedged&quot;)<br /><br />does that mean one purchase did not go thru escrow and the seller has those funds in his account already?

				Unless you hit &#039;finalize&#039; beside one of your orders, both are still in escrow.<br /><br />You may just be looking at the USD amount thats in escrow and assuming that&#039;s all that is there...however you may have BTC in escrow as well, depending on if the vendor(s) you placed orders from are pegging the BTC to USD or not.<br /><br />Hope that makes sense.<br /><br />-TH

				sorry, it doesn&#039;t make sense but my cranial capabilities have diminished with age<br /><br />it&#039;s actually showing the exact amount of one of the purchases as being in escrow - both were still &quot;in process&quot; at the time - <br /><br />think i need to figure out what the &quot;unhedged&quot; descript means, but when i put my mouse over that text, the text bubble defining it is off my screen to the left (i&#039;ve had a display issue with this linux OS that we tried to resolve in another thread)<br /><br />anyway, it&#039;s not worth frying too many brain cells over - both sellers pretty highly rated - i&#039;ll just wait and see<br /><br />tks for the response

				If you choose to hedge your escrow balance, then you will be paid roughly the bitcoin equivalent to the dollar values of your transactions at the time they were purchased.<br /><br /><br /><br />That&#039;s what it says :)

				If the listing is hedged, it will show you that you have USD in escrow. If it is not hedged, there will be only bitcoin in the escrow wallet.<br /><br />Hedging pretty much converts the bitcoin to USD, so that it is not affected by the price of bitcoin while it&#039;s in escrow.

				i went back and took another look at it and as you guys are saying, the one seller that hedged his price, that amount is showing as USD in escrow, the unhedged seller&#039;s amount is showing as hedged in btc<br /><br />tks for clearing the fog
