I&#039;m sure I sure another one as well. And there&#039;s probably more threads. To me though it doesn&#039;t matter. To me pine is gone, as once you close your account with SR, or even stop posting, that really is it, there&#039;s no coming back as you can never be sure who it is. <br /><br />A lot of us have already paid tribute to her contributions so that&#039;s pretty much the end piece on this matter.&nbsp; :-\
