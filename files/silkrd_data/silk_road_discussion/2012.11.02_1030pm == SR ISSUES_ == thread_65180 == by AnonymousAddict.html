				Yes this is happening a lot lately. SR does not read or listen to solutions either. So don;t rely on SR too much, it will be down many times.<br />

				First, my login page had no captcha?<br /><br />then it let me sign in with no captcha?!<br /><br />and now - all the pages are blank except for the banner at the top, with the home page logo, my coins (which are back to usd) and name etc<br /><br />this seems to be going way beyond just too much traffic

				I&#039;ve also been trying to log in all day and managed to get on about 10 hours ago. First it would lag a ton and sometimes not load the login page, then it would load the login with no capcha. When I put my info and tried to enter it lags out every time. Later it said &quot;site is down for maintenance,&quot; with the SR logo on a white page. Now it&#039;s saying &quot;404 - Not Found.&quot; Just letting you guys know so if it&#039;s happening to you also, you know you&#039;re not the only one. Let&#039;s all be patient, I&#039;m sure everything will be working fine very soon.
