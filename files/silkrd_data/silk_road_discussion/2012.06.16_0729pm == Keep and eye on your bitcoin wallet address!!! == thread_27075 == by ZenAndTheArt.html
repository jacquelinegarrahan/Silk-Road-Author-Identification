				WARNING, check your Silk Road wallet address often and ALWAYS before you make a transfer!<br /><br />The other day I noticed that my Silk Road wallet address had changed without me changing it!<br /><br />Lucky, I&#039;d noticed this before transferring 40 odd Bitcoins to my Silk Road wallet, I don&#039;t know what would&#039;ve happened to my coins if I&#039;d sent them to my old original address? So, I sent SR Support a message outlining what had been going on, saying that I strongly believe someone has got access to my account (with my login pin but NOT my money withdrawal pin).<br /><br />SR Support quickly replied back saying;<br /><br />re: Someone using my account?<br />Wallet address change periodically within the system. Keeping an eye on your transaction history &amp; changing your password periodically are good security practices. Message back with the wallet address if you have any more problems.<br />~SR Support<br /><br />Then my wallet address changed AGAIN!<br />And;<br /><br />re: HELP- Someone using my account?<br />Bitcoin addresses change automatically as a security measure of the site. Coins sent to your old addresses will still be linked to your account.<br />~SR Support<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to give you people a heads up on the situation. I&#039;m sure this is a new practice because I had the same wallet address for over two months and 16 contractions. And, I haven&#039;t seen a notice anywhere informing us about this change. It may just be me been stupid, but I thought &#039;better safe than sorry&#039; and put this out there.<br /><br />If anyone can shed some light on what&#039;s going on I would be very thankful,<br /><br />HAPPY TRAVAILING ON THE ROAD EVERYONE (be safe),<br />Lots of love from a Benzoed 8) (thanks BTG) Zen.

				I&#039;m quite sure transfers into your old addresses will still end up in your account. I wouldn&#039;t want to test that theory myself though.

I have checked this on my Instawallet and Intersango accounts page.<br />Again, maybe I&#039;m being thick, I&#039;m not the most computer savvy person.<br /><br />But, Silk Road Customer Support says that even if you send your coins to the previous, they should still arrive in your new address. I don&#039;t know how many of the previous address still work like this?<br /><br />Can anyone who has been using Silk Road for 6+ months, or who just has a greater understand of all this, please shed some light on the subject.<br />It&#039;s important for this site to keep the highest levels of trust when it comes to the customers money. For example, I no longer leave large amounts of ฿s on Silk Road, after the site-wide roll back that happened the other week. It didn&#039;t affect me at the time, but I still lost enough confidence to start keeping all my ฿ stored in wallets on other websites. It&#039;s easy to lose someones trust, but VERY hard to regain it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love the Road and most of the forum heads and vendors I&#039;ve meet here, so long my it continue!<br /><br />Love, Zen.

				Way back when, SR said that the addresses would change with each deposit. It didn&#039;t really work, so They removed that bit from the account page. Now it actually does work, but they just haven&#039;t added the statement back to the page.

				&nbsp;:)Thanks guys for clearing that up :)<br /><br />I do think that for us members of two months (and less) there should have been some announcement, it scarred the shit out of me.<br />I thought someone had phished access to my account but was missing the money withdrawal pin (that&#039;s a good safety idea having a second pin),<br />so the only malicious thing they could do was change my wallet address. Boy, do I feel stupid now, I was panicking earlier.<br /><br />Anyway, the post came today (thanks BTG), so I off to destroy those pesky braincells that keep telling me I need to do something with my life!<br /><br />&quot; Chose a job, chose a car, chose a wife, three kids and a house, chose 9 to 5 working for minimum wage, chose a TV, a washing machine...<br />&nbsp; I chose none of these, I chose Heroin... And the reasons why... the reasons why were, because I watched Trainspotting at an early age and thought it looked cool...&quot; (only joking)&nbsp;

				From being around a little while, I understand it is normal. It is good practice to change it for every transaction though.

But the SR address is changed after each deposit, no matter how small. You can (ahem) bank on it.<br /><br />But you are doing yourself a disfavor. You should never use the same address more than once. Each time you&#039;re getting ready to deposit coins to send them to SR (or to withdraw from SR), use a new address. In instawallet, this is easy. Just generate a new URL by going to www.instawallet.com. This immediately gives you a new URL and a new address. Just don&#039;t lose the URL!<br /><br />And in intersango, unless you are registered with a bank account or something, just register with a new username and password each time you want to use it. That way you get a new bitcoin address.<br /><br />Neutron Man
