				I dont know any place where you can buy bitcoin at this price<br /><br />but the silkroad s prices are based on that <br /><br />so I assume as a buyer we always pay more than the actual price if we purchase as soon as we buy the coins<br /><br />any suggestion to solve this problem would be really apreciate?<br />thanks

				The silkroad should switch to latest price if the market is volatile?<br /><br />Either that or give fair warning to both parties that orders placed in extremely volatile markets may not be honored (which is the de-facto situation right now, let&#039;s be honest)<br /><br />

When it was crashing a few days ago, you could buy BTC for $120 but the weighted average on SR was like $180.<br /><br />Right now, BTC is trading at $107 and the SR price is almost exactly the same, because it has been higher for the last few hours, around $115, but between 20-24 hours ago, it was much lower. Wait 4 hours and the SR average should go up, and if the current price is still around $107, you will get more than what you paid for your BTC (if you bought them right now).<br />

				Why is it that MtGox average is around $110 while BitStamp is low $90s.&nbsp; BitStamp has been atleast 10% lower than MtGox for days.&nbsp; So I&#039;d assume you&#039;d be spending your coin for more than you paid if you bought it from somewhere who sold them for less....

				Shit, the other night when MtGox decided to freeze trading, they froze their weighted average at $120 while BitStamp was still trading around $60.&nbsp; It does seem a bit centralized that MtGox is the only weighted average but it would be hard to add more calculations I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the blame is MtGox for freezing live statistics.&nbsp; The SR lag can be used to your advantage as it was for me when the price dropped.&nbsp; I bought coin at $200 and was able to see it drop quickly on MtGox.&nbsp; Spent it immediately with a vendor who was using hedging.&nbsp;

This should be VERY EASY to understand. It also happens to be the BEST SYSTEM SR can use. <br /><br />I can&#039;t even say what I really want to as it is just to mean..but for you to say &quot;they&quot; should give us fair warning in an extremely volatile market ...who do you mean by they? And how should &quot;they&quot; do it? Please do not try and answer these questions as there is no &quot;they&quot; Also do you realize with a 24 hour average you do have fair warning? Since SR does not use the &quot;current&quot; Mt.Gox price (that would be a disaster)&nbsp; it uses the 24 hour average...that means that if you look at SR price this second (it is 110 as I am typing this at 3:53pm PST and you look at the current Mt.Gox price...99.99 as of the exact time) GUESS WHAT????????????????????????<br /><br />In the next couple hours the SR price is going down!!!! OMG what does that mean??? It means if you had an IQ above 80...you can figure out where the SR price will be with out fail...every single time!! This might be the easiest thing to do! Also SR used to use the mtgox price and it was a disaster. Also realize that the market has ALWAYS been volatile...ALWAYS. It is also very very very simple to use coins and get the fair market value at the time you do so.<br /><br />I have read so many messages like yours. And it is always someone that has about 50 messages...that somehow got out of the newbie section and then thinks because they have posted 50 messages...that they now understand how everything works...so they will start posting idea&#039;s for SR to use. Really good ones. Except the total opposite.<br /><br />Also I read things like &quot;the SR lag&quot;....how the fuck do so many people not understand 24 hour average!!! That means it takes the average for 24 hours!!! So in the last 24 hours it has been $85 to $130 of course every 5 min those numbers change...and guess what???? SO DOES SR PRICES!!!!! Yet it seems 90% of the morons that post have not and can not figure this out! <br /><br />Also realize that Mt.Gox is actually shit. But unfortunatly it is the best exchange we have... And because the trading market is so small it is very volatol. But again that does not matter...as 99% of you just buy btc to use on here for drugs. The problem is when the coins are doing what they are doing...and you are to stupid to be able to predict (with 100% accuracy ) you panic and you come into the forums and make stupid post. Then you listen and take advice from other morons.<br /><br />What you all need to do that do not understand anything...is get your coin..whatever you pay for it (should never be more then 5% of the current rate) move it to SR..and with about 5 min of homework you should be able to figure out when to use your coins for maximum value. <br /><br />Also..there has been many threads about this..but still I see how buyers think buying from a vendor that uses hedging somehow affects you the buyer...IT DOES NOT!!! It makes no difference...as once you pay it is over for you...The reason why it is not for a vendor is that the vendor had to wait for you to finalize...and that can take days...so a vendor that has their items hedged is saying that they want the asking price ...the price you paid...no matter when you the buyer finalizes....a vendor that does not have an item hedged is saying...I don&#039;t care when the buyer finalizes...and I am not too concerned about what the btc does in the short term...&nbsp; That&#039;s it!!! It does not affect you at all. If the vendor offers you a refund then it would matter..but again..that in itself&nbsp; is rare so no need to go into that<br /><br />So please people..try to learn something and quit being so stupid<br /><br />To the OP....There are a lot of ways to get btc at SR prices. I for one have ALWAYS sold btc at the current SR rate. I even tell my customers that I will wait until they are online...so that id they got 1k in btc from me...then I will make sure they have 1k in there SR account...I will also tell them, with out fail..where the&nbsp; is btc going in the next hour and that if they want to hold onto they can as it is going up...or that they should use it in the next 15 min as it is going down. There are plenty of other that do the same.
