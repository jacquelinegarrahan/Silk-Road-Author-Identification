				FYI, the Keiser report will do a show (I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s going to be in its entirety or not) on Bitcoin this coming Tuesday. In the US it&#039;s shown on RT America (rt.com) and is repeated several times during the day.<br /><br />Should be interesting at least.

				What is wrong with torrents?&nbsp; Especially legal ones about the news? <br />I think TOR protects your IP if I&#039;m not mistaken.&nbsp; If not, just use a regular computer to watch this regular news clip about investing in bit coins.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think he is serious.

I am new in cryptography.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No problem. The first problem is that most people probably wouldn&#039;t know how to route BitTorrent traffic via Tor correctly, they&#039;d just assume that all their traffic is anonymized because they&#039;re running the TBB. I&#039;m not calling you an newb, but recently we&#039;ve noticed that some people on here are quite naive about how the Internet works at the most basic level e.g. not knowing what an IP address is, and thinking that the TBB is only for hidden services.<br /><br />But assuming you&#039;re more sophisticated than that, then there is an even bigger problem.<br /><br />If you use BitTorrent with Tor you&#039;ll send your real IP address out into the network. And that&#039;s not even the end of it, there&#039;s an entire family of exploits that depend on naive Tor users using BitTorrent.<br /><br />Read these:<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/04/not-anonymous-attack-reveals-bittorrent-users-on-tor-network/<br /><br />https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea<br /><br />Key quote: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The attack is actually worse than that: apparently in some cases uTorrent, BitSpirit, and libTorrent simply write your IP address directly into the information they send to the tracker and/or to other peers. Tor is doing its job: Tor is _anonymously_ sending your IP address to the tracker or peer. Nobody knows where you&#039;re sending your IP address from. But that probably isn&#039;t what you wanted your Bittorrent client to send.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-- Tor Development Team<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is no real incentive for the Tor developers to help people using the Tor network for BitTorrent traffic either. After all, it puts a lot of pressure on the network right now, and that&#039;s when most experienced users of Tor already know it&#039;s a bad idea, what would it be like when everybody uses it for BitTorrent traffic! Ten times slower, that&#039;s what. So it&#039;s best to keep file sharing separate from Tor.<br /><br />--<br /><br />If you really want to download torrents via Tor without being deanonymized, there is a proper way to go about it.<br /><br />Find a good seedbox using the Tor browser and then pay them in Bitcoins to use the seedbox. Then download the torrent to the seedbox, and then FTP the completed download through Tor. It will be slow and expensive but it shall work and also be anonymous.<br /><br />In practice, as the Ars Technica article suggests, there are better ways than insisting on using Tor.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147557.msg1013795#msg1013795">Quote from: canuckboy on April 14, 2013, 11:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is wrong with torrents?&nbsp; Especially legal ones about the news? <br />I think TOR protects your IP if I&#039;m not mistaken.&nbsp; If not, just use a regular computer to watch this regular news clip about investing in bit coins.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think he is serious.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are mistaken on both counts.<br /><br />What is wrong with torrents is what I&#039;ve described to oneiroi, and what&#039;s wrong with using a regular computer to watch the news clip is that you&#039;ve suggested you want to watch that clip on an anonymous illegal forum. In other words, depending on your threat model, LE agents may submit requests to Google in order to conduct traffic analysis.<br /><br />Example: Let us say you recommend to watch a youtube clip on this forum. People go to watch it on filternet. Fine. Nothing illegal in watching a youtube video. There&#039;s tens of thousands of other viewers, so you have some anonymity protection.<br /><br />But let us say you recommend this practice, once, twice, three times.<br /><br />The set of people who watch all three clips within a specific time period is very low due to the fundamental principal of counting, a detective best weapon. In fact it&#039;s probably the set of SR users you recommended watching the videos to.<br /><br />Seemingly innocent data, when combined with other data can be incriminating. Yes, you do need to be this paranoid on here. There&#039;s a list of LE agencies as long as your arm who would love to intercept SR users, and if they intercept you then they shall make you look like the most &quot;gangsta leet haxxor&quot; that ever did exist and you&#039;ll be made an example of.
