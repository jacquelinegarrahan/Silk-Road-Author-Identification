				hear me out here. what if DPR realized law enforcement agencies were really starting to focus on the silkroad, and had a back-up plan this entire time, and has actually already deployed it. so the plan would be to have a person, pre-selected incase of emergency. this person he would make sure he knew programming and the stuff required to run the SR. and he had just set up all of the little ways the LEA found &quot;him&quot; since the begenning of the silk road. and so he thought the feds and them were getting too close so he ordered fake id&#039;s to that guys house with his photograph and anonymously hinted to homeland security about the fake id&#039;s and with all the evidence they had concluded that DPR was this guy. and then he sets up a fake DOMAIN(all other site seizures are for the actual site, not just the domain name of it) seizure page and adds the SR logo in the back to hint us. (notice how all the law enforcement agencies havent posted anything about SR) perhaps he&#039;s making a whole new site. name and all (so it wont attract unwanted attention, as in his many posts he made obvious that he didnt want attention.

				There are some weird things about this whole arrest that make no sense. But I think it being an elaborate plot isn&#039;t very likely. Maybe if what you said is true then the guy being set up could be FriendlyChemist? I don&#039;t think that&#039;s likely either.

				I personally believe it is an Elaborate plot. There are to many holes in the news stories, and just so many things that don&#039;t add up(not including the watermark). I&#039;m surprised that there are still people on here that blindly accept this notion that the media is right in this case.<br /><br />AnonymousAddict,<br /><br />Such a plot would not take that much effort to set up. All that is really needed is forging a few fake documents, very easy when the news people can&#039;t verify them. Then spreading those documents and the story to one website carefully. Such news would RAPIDLY spread especially if there are documents. Once enough websites report it(by reporting it from the initial site and all connected sites), then the TV-Media will jump on it.<br /><br />People seem to be forgetting that all attempts to contact the FBI has demonstrated such individuals are clueless about anything related to this case or story, as if it didn&#039;t even happen in their books. I think it is highly likely DPR could orchestrate something like this. It would be the ultimate move. The ultimate troll. To prove how flawed and manipulable the media is. It really wouldn&#039;t take more than a week or two to set up. Fake documents and fake emails, etc. Shit, I imagine this could be set up in a day or two. All that&#039;s needed is fake stories, fake interview transcripts passed around, fake documents. If a person works hard enough and has the freetime they could do all of that in a DAY.<br /><br />So wake up and realize people that it is definitely inside the realm of possibility that this is a masterfully orchestrated hoax. From an intellectual stand point, such a thing isn&#039;t even difficult in my eyes given the vastly uneffecient media we have.

But yeah, every account mentions that Canadian authorities say that person didn&#039;t exist. <br /><br />&quot;Bizarre and brutal—but was it real? Redandwhite does not appear to have been a federal agent, since FBI agent Christopher Tarbell—who was also involved in bringing down Hector &quot;Sabu&quot; Monsegur from Anonymous—called up the Canadian police to find out if a murder had really happened. According to Tarbell, the Canadians have &quot;no record of there being any Canadian resident with the name DPR passed to Redandwhite as the target of the solicited murder-for-hire. Nor do they have any record of a homicide occurring in White Rock, British Columbia on or about March 31, 2013.&quot;<br />http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/2/<br /><br />They think he was scammed on the hit.

				The hit wasn&#039;t reported as different amounts on Ars Technica.&nbsp; The Ars Technica article first talks about the first hit DPR made earlier in the year, which was for $80 grand and was actually made to an undercover officer, then LE staged a death photo to make it look real.&nbsp; He then made another hit later on in the year on FriendlyChemist for $150 grand, although the authorities have no record of a homicide occurring.&nbsp; What most likely happened, is FriendlyChemist created the account redandwhite himself, posing as the &quot;guys who FriendlyChemist owed money too&quot; (he likely did not owe money to anybody and was just using this an excuse to justify extorting DPR).&nbsp; DPR then sends him $150 grand, he sends him a fake picture (not hard to take a picture of someone and make it look like they&#039;re lying dead) and doesn&#039;t send him anymore messages from his FriendlyChemist account to make it look like the hit was carried out.&nbsp; So it looks like, in reality, DPR ordered 2 hits but neither were actually made.

				My theory (if the one that the feds published isn&#039;t correct - which probably is the case) is that DPR took the money in escrow and put the seized picture up. The feds were happy to take the &quot;blame&quot; to keep other site owners/vendors on their toes.

				Yes, those are the correct figures according to the complaint and the Maryland charges. How much of it is true is, of course, yet to be determined. The &#039;FriendlyChemist&#039; story in particular seems very odd indeed as, according to Canadian LE, no murder took place and no person of his name existed.<br /><br />I would also like confirmation from those who&#039;ve been here a while that there was indeed once a vendor named &#039;FriendlyChemist&#039;.

The interesting thing about the FriendlyChemist thing is that Ulbricht wasn&#039;t charged in that. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the best reporting I&#039;ve seen on the hitman aspect of this. And as for the one in MD he got indicted for, I think many have a good idea of who that employee is. From Bloomberg:<br /><br />&quot;FriendlyChemist<br /><br />Using his pirate code name, Ulbricht corresponded with a Silk Road user called redandwhite, who said he represented the people owed money by FriendlyChemist.<br /><br />“In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn’t mind if he was executed,” Ulbricht said on March 27, according to the complaint. He provided FriendlyChemist’s name and address in White Rock, British Columbia, noting “Wife +3 kids.” Ulbricht paid $150,000 to redandwhite to have FriendlyChemist killed, according to the complaint.<br /><br />Tarbell said Canadian law enforcement authorities had no record of any Canadian resident with the name that Ulbricht, as Dread Pirate Roberts, had passed on to redandwhite nor any record of a homicide in White Rock at the time. Ulbricht wasn’t charged in that alleged murder-for-hire scheme.<br /><br />Yesterday, Ulbricht was charged in federal court in Manhattan with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. If convicted, he may face life in prison. He made an initial appearance in a five-minute proceeding yesterday in federal court in San Francisco. Ulbricht said he can’t afford an attorney and was assigned a federal public defender. He remains in custody.<br /><br />Murder for Hire<br /><br />Separately, Ulbricht was accused in the indictment in Baltimore of trying to have one of his administrators killed to prevent him from talking to police. In January, Ulbricht communicated with an undercover federal agent who posed as a drug trafficker, saying the employee, who wasn’t identified in the indictment unsealed yesterday, had stolen money from Silk Road users and had been arrested.<br /><br />“I’d like him beat up, then forced to send the Bitcoins he stole back,” Ulbricht allegedly said in a message. “Like sit him down at his computer and make him do it.”<br />Execute, Torture<br /><br />Later, Ulbricht asked the undercover agent: “Can you change the order to execute rather than torture?” according to the indictment.<br /><br />Ulbricht paid $80,000 for the employee’s murder, saying he feared the employee would give information to law enforcement, according to prosecutors. The undercover agent sent Ulbricht a staged photograph to make it appear the employee had been murdered, they said.<br /><br />“I’m pissed I had to kill him ... but what’s done is done,” Ulbricht said, according to the indictment. “I just can’t believe he was so stupid. I just wish more people had some integrity.”<br /><br />The criminal case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-mg-023287; the civil forfeiture case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-cv-06919, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The Maryland case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-00222, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore).&quot;<br />www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-03/cyber-drug-bazaar-s-alleged-boss-paired-ebay-style-crime.html
