				Yesterday I overnighted 4.6K to a friend. The package weighed 8.3 oz.<br /><br />Today he received it, 2.5K short &amp; weighing 5oz. The packaging looked untampered with, no love note, nothing suspicious. We clearly got robbed.<br /><br />We learned an expensive lesson in stealth shipping today. But my question is is: without doubting my or my friends honesty, how paranoid should we be? Like, do you think this was a postal worker who just got lucky and made some strip club money or do you think it was LEO? <br /><br />If post office worker, why not take all of it? If it&#039;s a case of wanting to not get caught, why not take even more?<br /><br />If LEO, why not either let it go through after logging the amount, or seize it altogether? Because only taking some makes us paranoid and want to lay low.<br /><br />Please advise. Thanks.<br /><br /><br />

				Well, then I&#039;d be quite astounded that they got to it without any signs of opening and resealing the envelope.<br /><br />Did you use glue on all the flaps just to be sure?

				Your friend robbed you. You&#039;re being very naive if you think other wise. <br /><br />There&#039;s also not a damn thing you can do about it.<br /><br />EDIT: just want to put some logic into this for you.<br /><br />Think about it if usps did take the money. Then the employee doing it would have taken it out, why wouldn&#039;t he? It just makes absolutely no sense. <br />Someone to receive a package like that and claim only some money is missing, sounds like guilt from stealing the rest of it. <br />Also if a usps employee did it they could have just threw a sticker on there saying items conviscated like they always do and ship the shit like normal.

				yes, it did. and i&#039;d love to know if anyone has any insight as to what&#039;s up.<br /><br />if i weren&#039;t currently spooked, i&#039;d be doing literally anything else with my life rather than posting hypothetical questions to a hard-to-find forum.

				I ordered a small amount of &#039;powder&#039; a couple of weeks ago, and when I received it, about 25% was missing. It was obvious that the (untracked) envelope had been opened, the powder removed, and then the envelope pressed back down to appear that it hadn&#039;t been opened. I was slightly concerned that it could have been LE that removed the powder to test it, but since then other tracked shipments have gotten through just fine. The seller has 100% positive feedback, with no one reporting similar problems. This lead me to, pretty conclusively, realize that it had been stolen by a postal worker looking for a free high. Although, if he thought it was coke when he snorted it, I&#039;d imagine that for a couple of hours, he&#039;d have thought he was dying, which makes me smile&nbsp; :D.<br /><br />I&#039;d say at this point, you&#039;re probably good to go.<br /><br />I posted an article a month or so ago about a postal worker in Ohio that was caught stealing envelopes of money and stuffing them in his pants. Apparently this shit happens a decent amount. If it&#039;s not one government agency fucking you over, it&#039;s another.

				I remember one time I forgot to put something inside of a customer&#039;s package so I tried to reopen it without making too much of a mess, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible, the glue was everywhere, oh god that glue.

				Did you by chance weigh your packaging separate from the cash prior to mailing, or did you weigh the cash?&nbsp; If the cash was all the same denomination, then according to the figures you&#039;ve provided (*and* if they&#039;re all accurate), the packaging weighed 2.2 ounces and the cash weighed 6.1 oz.<br /><br />Do you have any real evidence other than your buddy&#039;s word as to what the package looked like when he received it and how much it weighed?<br /><br />Is your buddy a known prankster? Or if he&#039;s married, does he have a habit that he hides from his wife? And how the hell do you get an ontime overnight delivery from the USPS?&nbsp; After about a half dozen attempts at that and not one of them working, I switched to strictly Fedex for things that had to be overnighted, and they&#039;ve yet to let me down -- never sent cash or drugs through them, but lots of checks and other sensitive stuff like contracts, titles, legal papers, business deals, etc.<br /><br />So either a), your buddy&#039;s fibbin&#039;, or b), some postal worker needed exactly $2500 to pay his or her bookie, or to keep his or her car from being repo&#039;ed...my money&#039;s on a)<br /><br />Anyhow, sorry for your loss, hope you get it figured out and that it has nothing to do with LE...<br />
