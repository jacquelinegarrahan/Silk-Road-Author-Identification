				The other day I was at a friends house, and we were setting up our email encryption together, and I had my Netbook there. When we were done setting everything up, we each logged on to SR, and all of the numbers that show how many listings are in each topic were different from his computer to mine. We checked the url&nbsp; on each of our computers just in case one of us were on a fake site, and they were both the same. We thought this was a little strange. Does this mean anything? Can anyone explain it?<br /><br />

				Did You used Ctrl+F5 to reload page? Maybe cached version was loaded instead of current one. This is strange, since Tor by default prevents browser caching.<br /><br />Or the SR forum are run from multiple instances and the DB is synched.

				No, we both just hit refresh, and each time the numbers stayed the same on each of our computers.<br />Here&#039;s the link I&#039;m using:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion

				So I guess there is multiple instances running. Did I manage to crack one of SR secrets? ::)<br /><br />Never tried by myself to run multiple instances with the same .onion secret key.<br /><br />Or maybe you have done something wrong...

				Just logged in to SR, and there are 985 total listings if anyone wants to check it out. The other day, there was 980 something on my computer, and almost 1200 on my friends.

				It seems like one of you hasn&#039;t set your location. Only certain items will show up, depending on where a vendor will ship them to. For example, I&#039;m in Australia, and none of Pharmvilles listings show up for me as he doesn&#039;t ship here.

				Chrispo hit the nail on the head. After using this site for awhile I now have both a vendor and a buyer account. On my vendor account I declared a country when I joined but on my buyers account I left it undeclared. Each time there is a different number of listings showing on each account. This must be due to the fact that I declared a country on one account but not the other.

				Are we talking about Silk Road marketplace or Silk Road forums?<br /><br />Marketplace will show only listings that are shipped to your country if you declare one. The Forums must show consistent number of message count, unless there are multiple SR Forums running.

				Profile location differences, can edit it in settings.<br />SR won&#039;t show listings that cannot be shipped to your set country of origin.

				Got it! Makes sense now. He is set as undeclared, and I&#039;m set as U.S.
