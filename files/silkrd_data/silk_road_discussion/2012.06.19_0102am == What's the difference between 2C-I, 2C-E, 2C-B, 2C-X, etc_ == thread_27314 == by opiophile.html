				I have only done 2c-c 2c-i and 2c-e. 2c-c is very mild and is the shortest in duration of the 2c-x&#039;s that I am aware of. The high only last 2-4 hours and feels like a very mild dose of 2c-i in my opinion, music is enhanced and tracers become very apparent. 2c-i is almost only visual, so much so that many of my friends get kind of tired of it after a few hours....it can last 5-8 hours depending on your dosage. Some say it also has speedy characteristics but I have never felt this really. 2c-e in high dosages provides mescaline like visuals for me, lots of swirling colors and a lot more mentally active like acid or mushrooms, makes you think about stuff and the like. Out of all three 2ce is definitely most intense but I prefer the 2c-i because I can actually sleep when it&#039;s over....2ce I have never once been able to sleep that night even if I was done tripping but I have had friends that pass out no problem.

				2ci - pretty much only visual, feels synthetic, euphoria first few times, completely clear headed trip<br />2ce - favorite out all the 2cs I&#039;ve tried. Visuals are amazing, euphoria is great first few times, body-load annoys some I&#039;m rather healthy and so it doesn&#039;t bother me. Sometimes profound and visual experiences, great head-space. But it has the power to go from a wonderful euphoric experience to a nightmare, but this is a good one.<br />2cb - haven&#039;t tried it yet, will do in the near future. I hear its a lot like MDA and lightly psychedelic, also fit for any occasion. This is what I&#039;ve heard btw.<br />

				2c-b, very visual, changes in perception of time/space but nothing really profound. It&#039;s just a really altered perspective, your sense of self is still pretty much the same, but with the most INSANELY detailed visuals. Trees/leaves/basically any&nbsp; object is a wonder to look at on 2c-b<br /><br />

				I took 16mg of 2C-E last night with a bit of molly and oh my god it was amazing! I had my lava lamp on (hippy?) and had my own pow wow next to it with my bongo drum and safari hat on. The visuals were amazing, my walls were glittering like I was in a space dome. Like the ceiling in the food court in Hogwarts Castle, which mimics the sky....so anyways it&#039;s safe to say I was certainly tripping. I eventually traveled out to my yard and it felt I was Willy Wonka in search of oompa loompas, surrounded by tall grass and creatures. Last of all I played my guitar and chilled to some music and kept toking some Cherry Pie until I passed out. I&#039;m still a bit dazed since I woke up and there&#039;s still a trace of some visuals swimming past my eyes but overall it was a good night. My brain feels like it has been massaged and I apparently cleaned my house last night so hell yeah! ;D

				The difference is the substituent on the 4 position of the 2,5-dimethoxy-phenylethylamine. C is chlorine, B is bromine, I is iodine, D is methyl, E is ethyl, P is propyl, T-x are thio-alkanes, N is nitro, H is hydrogen (no subsituent).
