				I find myself wanting to order something from the marketplace. I find the idea of the escrow comforting, but how do they actually work it? How does the escrow decide if what you purchased was fake or not what it was advertised to be? This is a primary concern of mine and I would appreciate the opinions of others regarding this matter. I am reticent to jump into another rip-off as I have in the past. I&#039;d like to think this place is different, but I see nowhere in the &quot;fine print&quot; where SR or it&#039;s administrators actually test the purchased item for validity or strength. Any feedback or opinion regarding this issue would be much appreciated.

From my understanding escrow does not determine if your purchase was fake or not, it is more of an intermediary that holds a specific amount between the buyer and seller. This place certainly is different. Why&nbsp; would the administrators of the SR test your purchased items?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Oscar.

Escrow is also used to hold your coins in case you have a problem and need to settle it with the SR admins. They will decide if your BTC goes to the vender or you in that case.
