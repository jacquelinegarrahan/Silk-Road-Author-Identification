				First off let me introduce myself. I have been a long time lurker, I first came here after reading the gawker article as I suppose many of you did. At first it seemed all to complicated and expensive a way to accomplish something I could usually do through my local connections and street corners. But as I have grown and become successful in my personal and professional life this now seems like a more sophisticated and discrete method to go about such things. In either case I&#039;m getting started and have an issue.<br /><br />I recently made my first bitcoin purchase through Bitinstant, It&#039;s been 9 hours since i sent the money gram and still no deposit into my TORwallet. I&#039;ve double checked the address and all matches up, I&#039;ve keep an eye on blockchain and nothing. <br /><br />Update:<br />As I was typing this I was contacted by bitInstant customer service and they have started to work on clearing everything up. Apparently transactions get held up in the exchange and blockchain occasionally. <br /><br />My question is now, is this fairly common? Seems odd for my first transaction to have this happen. I did some forum searches and it looks like some others had similar problems this weekend. Also, any advice for a newb would be appreciated.

				Haha, I see a similar topic on the front page. Apparently this isn&#039;t all that uncommon. Should have checked before I posted, don&#039;t have access to TOR on the go so I&#039;ve just been cruising regular net. Well, just consider this my introduction then.
