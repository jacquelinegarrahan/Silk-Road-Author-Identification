				I believe they stopped doing that a month or so ago. I think the banks saw it as competition and stopped cooperating.

				Yea I noticed that too a few weeks ago. I always did that option. I now use the moneygram option at a local drugstore. To me it feels a little safer. All I do is go in, use the &quot;red phone&quot;, give fake name and phone number and I&#039;m out. I actually just did it a few hours ago lol.

				I use BitInstant at WalMart now.&nbsp; I used to use their bank deposit option, but always was a little sketched out by all the cameras looking at me from every direction.&nbsp; I know there are cameras at WalMart, but idunno, they seem less threatening than the ones at a bank.<br /><br />But anyway, not giving a name to the bank vs. giving a fake name to the customer service rep at WalMart is exactly the same.&nbsp; I mean the typical customer associate at WalMart isn&#039;t exactly a picture of astute intelligence.&nbsp; <br /><br />And lastly, the WM option seems to go through much faster than the banks used to.&nbsp; Usually when I used to use the bank deposit option, I would have to call them after like 20 minutes to ask them to confirm the transaction.&nbsp; &nbsp;With ZipZap or whatever it&#039;s called, I usually get the BTC transaction alert to my wallet (phone beeps) before the receipt even prints.&nbsp; It&#039;s fantastic.<br /><br />But all that said, I would still rather use Dwolla to Exchange to wallet to mixer to SR, especially when I&#039;m dealing with a large amount of BTC, since the markup from BitInstant kills me.&nbsp; But for smaller transactions, I don&#039;t mind paying a premium for immediate coins.

I was bummed about the bank option disappearing, but let&#039;s be honest here: who really expects good things to come from banks anyway? Every time my grandmother talks about how they used to give up to 7% interest on checking accounts back in her day I feel like weeping.
