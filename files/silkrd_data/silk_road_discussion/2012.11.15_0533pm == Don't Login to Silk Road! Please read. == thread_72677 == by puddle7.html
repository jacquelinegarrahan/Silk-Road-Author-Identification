				I agree there&#039;s a lot of logic to this.&nbsp; If you imagine the normal traffic is 5% of total SR users accessing on any particular day, and then The Road is down for a whole week, you can imagine how many people (especially dope fiends!) are now ready to go on, place orders, finalise, etc, etc.&nbsp; So since things came back online last night/this morning, it could be +80% of the community ALL trying to access at the same time.<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit like when Glastonbury tickets go on sale.&nbsp; Everyone hitting refresh, and hardly anyone getting in.&nbsp; The whole system is overloaded.<br /><br />However, the two things that make me question the &#039;It&#039;s Us&#039; theory,&nbsp; is you would&#039;ve thought SOME buyers/vendors would&#039;ve got onto the site, and I haven&#039;t seen anyone claiming this since around 8am this morning.&nbsp; I got on last night and finalised an order, and did some window shopping.&nbsp; No luck today.&nbsp; Only the login page (once or twice) with dodgy looking Capcha image....<br /><br />The other thing that makes me question the &#039;It&#039;s us&#039; theory is why has there been no update from moderators or DPR?&nbsp; This seems odd, and is not consistent with the regular updates of the last few days.&nbsp; If the problem is being caused by too many of us trying to access, you&#039;d have thought DPR or someone would&#039;ve notified us.&nbsp; If DPR doesn&#039;t update for 24 hours or more I think people will start to get very worried...&nbsp;

				True that.. I was sayin to someone earlier it would be good if we could restrict time periods to certain areas.. so uk has 8-10pm, america 10pm-12pm.. etc etc, you get my drift..

				This makes total sense! The roads been down for a few days the minute it&#039;s back up everyone is going to log back on at the same time and the server crashes.<br />I was on it last night at about 2 finalizing with a vendor and everything was working fine. I&#039;m sure if we give it some time and stop hitting refresh it will be up and running soon.<br /><br />I wish everyone would calm down, The amount of treads saying hacked and so on. This is by far the most likely explanation.

				Maybe a timeout function is needed.<br /><br />If your not actively using SR your session gets cut after 10 minutes. <br /><br />I think one of the biggest problems right now is sketched out people trying to get on to withdraw coin.<br /><br />If new registrations are currently closed lets go a step further and temporarily suspend accounts with a 0/0 transaction history. No point wasting bandwith on window shoppers.<br /><br />Lets try and restrict access to only serious buyers with a history till stuff gets sorted.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TC

				i agree with the restriction ideas for the current situation.&nbsp; or even as proposed, different regions get different access time.&nbsp; it makes sense for the current situation of SR.&nbsp; let only the people that actually spend money use the site for the first few days and once everything&#039;s stable open it back up.

				I&#039;ll just say it, this is stupid.&nbsp; If the server can&#039;t handle serving up vanilla html on the logon screen, it doesnt deserve to live.&nbsp; Even with default configurations, it should be able to serve basic html without so much as a hiccup.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that the whole world isn&#039;t up at the same time.... this is fucken stupid.<br /><br />Poor planning and, to some extent,&nbsp; limitations on hidden services are the reason this is happening.<br /><br /><br />DDoSing...fucken kids.

				Everyone just needs to relax. Go outside, get some sunlight.<br /><br />I have orders not shipped due to all the down time from last week, not worried.. everything will come together just fine.<br /><br />Vendors that have common sense knows technology will break/need to be updated, consumers also.. these are the people we need here on SR.. the ones that are in panic mode aren&#039;t really the people we want here anyway.<br /><br />

				I still haven&#039;t logged in.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad the site is back up, but I don&#039;t have any pressing business to do at the moment so I&#039;m letting things settle down, as I asked everyone else to do.&nbsp; Maybe in the future some kind of indication of heavy load could be added so everyone can voluntarily limit their use of the site to prevent problems.&nbsp; Perhaps even add a vendors only address so that when things get bad vendors can keep up with demand while issues get sorted out.&nbsp; I&#039;m not currently a vendor, but it makes sense to me that the site prioritize traffic in some way when there are problems.
