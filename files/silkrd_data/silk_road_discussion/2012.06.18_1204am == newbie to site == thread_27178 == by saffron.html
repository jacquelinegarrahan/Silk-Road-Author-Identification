				Translation: Where is the best place to buy bitcoins?<br /><br />Try using Dwolla to get Bitcoins to MtGox :) Send those to Bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/) then sent to here.<br />Learn to use PGP and research vendors on the forum before you buy anything.

MtGox requires some serious identification if you&#039;re exchanging Dwolla for coin on MtGox (unless this doesn&#039;t apply outside of the US). I&#039;ve began using Intersango as a slightly pricy alternative.

It works in America, should work wherever you are.<br /><br />You need a few things -- it&#039;s all about how you use them together. <br /><br />1. Bank account<br />2. Dwolla.com account<br />3. Intersango.com account<br />4. Silk Road account<br /><br />Step 1. Deposit say, $100 into your bank account.<br />Step 2. Log into Dwolla.com, go to deposit, and choose to deposit $100 dollars from your bank account (you can add/edit bank accounts that you want to link to the dwolla).<br />Step 3. You&#039;ll have to wait 3-5 business days for the money to clear, it sucks. But you wait.<br />Step 4. The money is now in your Dwolla.com account, you go to Intersango.com for the transfer. On Intersango you need to go to the accounts tab, find your currency, and click add funds. Follow the prompts and the money should clear within 1-2 hours.<br />Step 5. Go over to buy/sell on Intersango and pick out the amount of coins that you want to buy. Once you fill an order, the coins are in your Intersango balance.<br />Step 6. Click back on your accounts tab, and then find BTC and withdraw it to your silk road name. Under the SILK ROAD accounts section, there is a specific BTC address that will always be just yours. You simply copy paste that into the section where it says &quot;withdrawal address&quot; on Intersango and the funds will show up within an hour on the road. That&#039;s that.<br /><br />Good luck. PM if you have other questions. <br /><br />Oh, some people take an extra step after Intersango and run the money through a BTC wallet. I didn&#039;t bother to outline it because I don&#039;t often do it.

				There are a lot of ways to acquire bitcoins, someone in your area might even have some for sale and you could just pay them cash.<br /><br />Here is a link to the currency exchange forum of a bitcointalk.org<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0<br /><br />That forum has everything you need to know about bitcoin.<br />Depending where you are there are various ways, and you can definitely find one that fits you here.<br />The 2 main options are <br />person 2 person <br />or <br />Facilitated through a business of sorts <br />Have Fun<br /><br />Edit* Keep your identity there separate from here. Seriously.
