				UPDATE (0051 UTC 11/24/2012): I think we have this problem taken care of for the time being.&nbsp; I&#039;ve said that so many times in the past couple of weeks that I hate to say it again, but we should be sailing smooth.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hey everyone,<br /><br />So sorry no one could login for the past 12 hours or so.&nbsp; Ever since we came back up from the down-time, we&#039;ve been having some trouble with the authentication controller.&nbsp; For some reason it won&#039;t match the credentials you put in to the record, so it just kicks you back to the login screen.&nbsp; I&#039;ve restarted it and it is working fine again, so we&#039;ll be looking at what the issue might be today and hopefully sort it out.<br /><br />DPR<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQr4YTAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olYowH/3gnYJWlBYj0pi3lmgP0rnVJ<br />B6nDB8ln8hnR/9kASgYXZxD56QdpTG86VjyT+fAcJWx6qxhM0Jt/Lzk0dbdNF0pN<br />8EKc39eNbUp7yjPIvK4dhinyGjprB4k5DrfI4XvXaUv9XbmLCaKiHT8mG76FshZU<br />FRMPh3V4WINycNTOY/wAAmArxpsVCSP7MzjMwJuwkPqe105DC/5YTmy8EDfCCCCu<br />JLYXIjpx8UFK51ftG96hKL0t3vMqr5OPbEC/eZBJiCwgmRfFiR1GuLOhnq0q8yol<br />QQ9KKWBjioE9XrAcXSyFEENTbk+2p2e6BKcNHCLteVPb2DN9RQRIWMc2mswPHok=<br />=9rU2<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

This is not eBay. Perhaps you can code? Obviously not or you could build your own site and be in charge of keeping it running while at the same time being the most wanted Cyber Criminal on the planet. The site has not been down for 3 weeks, I was placing all the orders that I needed this week and everything has been arriving as planned. Yes of coarse I would feel better if I finalize payment to my deserving vendors, but at the same time I know that they understand that these issues are making things tough on all of us. So If I, and everybody else were able to conduct business last week, why did you leave 350K sitting in your account KNOWING the site has been having stability problems. Sounds to me like you had plenty of time to drop down your balance. I&#039;m guessing that is why UMAD BRO? You&#039;re mad at yourself for being stupid.

				I too am getting a blank white screen instead of the login screen when trying to pull up SR, going on 2 days now. I assume it&#039;s because of maintenance and whatnot, it just seems like not very many people are having this problem. Or perhaps like after this last big crash I expected more of an uproar in the forums about this... :-)
