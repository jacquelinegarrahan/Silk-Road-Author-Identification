				Hey guys, this is my first time discovering silk road/tor.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So far, what ive gathered the actual site is down but it will be up shortly&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Basically what im confused about is, BitCoin.<br /><br />I have 200 bucks on paypal which id like to convert to bitcoin if thats possible :/<br /><br />Now, to make a bitcoin account you have to download it on your computer and all right? Well can you make an account on one computer then log in on a different computer? Is that possible?<br /><br />And how many USD is worth a BitCoin, its a fluxuating market right?

				VirWox is possible to use with PayPal, but it&#039;s a ripoff and they hold your transactions for up to 2 days often.

				Yeah, set up a wallet, then there are different ways of getting btc.&nbsp; Yeah, u can get them on paypal, and in an emergency, they&#039;ve worked, but they cost double/triple/quadruple what the going rate is.&nbsp; Easy.&nbsp; and get it....<br /><br />I&#039;d join tradehill.com, or probably better, now, is get-bitcoin.com They look pretty good.&nbsp; Look, all of us have to deal in this, and we all have to figure out what works for us, and how paranoid we are about our id&#039;s getting out there...I&#039;m not too much on the paranoid side...buy the bitcoins at one of the above, then wash them once in instawallet.com, then send them here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then panic for 4-24 hrs while you think your btc have disappeared, and then they show up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, hard part--for me--is getting dollars to a place that sells bitcoins...dwolla is one way, but you can go to those sites and see the other ways....take care...

They don&#039;t really have any value, but you can trade them for items.<br />You can buy and sell them, but there is no clear fixed price, it&#039;s whatever people are willing to pay at the moment.<br />So cash -&gt; SR item ?<br />Well first you need BTC (BitCoin), and there are only certain websites/companies/individuals you can go through to buy them. Some have already been listed, many are mentioned in numerous other forum threads. When you set up an account at SR, you have 0 BTC in your account. So once you buy yourself some BTC you transfer it into your SR account. Then you can start shopping!<br />The security precautions and optional intermediary steps have been left out to keep the post shorter, but that&#039;s the basic idea of cash to SR items using BitCoin.<br />Cash -&gt; BitCoin Service -&gt; SR<br />I recommend you read the other related threads in the security section of the forum, and be sure to ask whenever you have questions.
