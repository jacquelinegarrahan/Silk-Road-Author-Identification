				Not sure if this is the right section of the forum. Mods please move it if this belongs somewhere else.<br /><br />I have a lot of experience dealing with Juergen. Is his LSD real LSD? Is it actually 300mics as he advertises?<br /><br />What about EnterTheMatrix? Is his LSD real? Is it actually 250mics as he advertises?<br /><br />Which would you consider to be the better deal? I am planning on buying 5 hits.<br /><br />Thanks for the help.

				Avoid both like the plague and check out the Avenger LSD thread for some proper advice. I&#039;ve had my eye on Tessellated&#039;s stock and judging from the feedback it is top notch and great value for money compared to ETM who do not guarantee you 250ug. If you read their info it states that 150ug is the minimum and 250ug is the maximum so your acid content could be anywhere inbetween.Sketchy as fuck but it is definitely real LSD.&nbsp; Jeurgen has had a lot of reports stating that the acid is far too weak to be 300ug as well so I wouldn&#039;t trust that stock either. Trust me, check the Avengers LSD thread. and enjoy your quality product.

				Tried Matrix current batch and it is very weak.... hardly felt it and I have not taken any trips in a while. VERY DISAPPOINTING. Its a pity as he/she is a great seller....if only the product was better.<br /><br />Test a few days ago so current batch is bad. Have had better experiences previously with this seller

				A friend of mine ordered ETM&#039;s lsd around 2 months ago and also said it was weak, definitely not 200ug as is the stated average of the tabs.

				im 100% sure this wasnt nbome.<br />ive done lots of both c and i lately and i know that bitter and harsh taste of them.<br />I buy my nbome from nevita btw :)<br /><br />I could barely taste the bitterness of this tab, only with the tip of my tongue.<br />and the trip was much longer and heavier than nbome, and ive tried a pretty high dose...<br />I havent tried doc, so i cant compare.<br /><br />

				omg just stay away from ETM use the LSD Ad&#039;s guide to real stuff. <br /><br />When i first join Sr, i was just looking for acid. Bought 5 hits (shown as 3500mics each) for a small fortune. I fiiiiinally got them and they jack shit. no head stuff, no body, no colors, just somewhat annoying tracers on the baseball during the playoffs.<br /><br />One of the biggest let downs of my life.<br /><br />I finally called them out and they said &quot;uhhh it must have been a bad batch, you should have told us&quot; Then i told them to just send me one real tab for my struggles.....no response. fuck them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done my research, i know where the goodfs are, now i just another paycheck :-)<br /><br />roth

				The LSD should be tasteless for sure but some of the sheets some guys use are bitter as funk. I had this one blotter from DrGreenfingers (great vendor gone AWOL) that when I sucked it it fell apart like butter in a second and had a bitter taste but it was most certainly acid. Tripped balls. Same goes for Subtickle&#039;s blotter (re-up man!). It&#039;s was quite bitter but no numbness on the tounge and it was by far my favourite acid trip so far. Unbelievable OEV&#039;s .Very surprised at Jeurgen review as well, not long ago everyone was on his case for supplying weak acid. Maybe he&#039;s got a new batch or something? In any case I would still stick what&#039;s tried and true and from what I can gather you should be throwing coins Tessellated&#039;s way.

				I had ETM&#039;s LSD about a month ago and it was VERY week. A friend &amp; I took 2 about 2 hours apart and at T+4hr we were trying to decide if there was placebo or if we were just feeling the faintest hint of LSD... He blamed it on the high heat &amp; said it might have deteriorated.

				hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been fortunate enough to try both juergens AND ETM&#039;s tabs, and this is what I experienced: When i first learned how to use silk road back in december, my first goal was to order some good doses, so i ordered a 5 strip from juergen AND a 5 strip from etm. I got my five <br /><br />strip from juergen first and decided to try some that night. They came on a brownish, thick piece of paper, unperforated. Now, at the time, I had no idea what 300 micrograms meant. I read online somewhere that the average was from 60-120 mics per hit. Ive had acid many <br /><br />times, and have eaten multiple hits of what was considered to be &quot;really good acid&quot;. So, I figured eating two of juergens would be a fun, manageable ride. Big mistake. I was by myself in my bedroom, with a sleeping parent down the hall when i ate these. I have never tripped <br /><br />so hard in my entire life, and was literally hallucinating for 24 hours. I saw things during the first 6 hours that i never thought was possible on acid. If i had&nbsp; known what was going to happen to me, or if i was with a trip sitter i probably would have enjoyed it, however this <br /><br />time it was downright frightening. Anyway, about a week later i decided to try etms tabs. Remembering the foolish mistake i made the week before, i decided to only eat one of etms. I figured i would still have a good time, since ETM&#039;s hits were supposedly only 50 mics less <br /><br />than juergens. However, i barely tripped from this one tab, and all it did was keep me up all night. Needless to say i was pissed. I ended up selling the remaining 4 ETM&#039;s to someone, who said they had a good time from eating all 4, so i know they weren&#039;t fake. So, between <br /><br />the two vendors, id have to say juergen is cheaper and has better product than ETM. However, I tried ordering another 5 strip from juergen about a month ago and ran into some problems. Back in early december i ordered another 300 mic 5 strip from juergen. When it <br /><br />arrived, it was on a silk road perforrated blotter paper. Much different from the thick brown paper i got back in september when i ordered. This time I only ate half of a tab, thinking i would trip absolute balls. However, an hour after eating it, i felt nothing. I ended up having <br /><br />to eat about 1 and a half hits total to have a decent trip. So, i messaged juergen a few days later and told him about my problem. I told him that compared to the ones i had ordered a few months ago, these ones were incredibly weak. I politely asked him for either a partial <br /><br />refund, or to resend me like 1 or 2 of the incredibly strong tabs. Much to my surprise juergen offered to send me a whole new 5 strip. &quot;Wow!&quot; I thought, &quot;what a swell guy&quot;. However, when i got this new batch a week later, these were just as weak, if not weaker then the ones i <br /><br />had just got. It was nice of the guy to send me another 5 strip, but i ended up paying about 100 U.S dollars for ten below average doses, which is kind of a ripoff. I hope that maybe he was just busy because of the christmas season, but i am definately worried about ordering <br /><br />from him again. So, to conclude, in my opinion, juergen&#039;s hits are definately superior to ETM&#039;s, but there is a possibility that juergens tabs are not as potent as they used to be. Sorry for the long post, but i hope it was helpful

They prey on noobs. They made me FE when I didnt know what an FE was. Took all 5 tabs and had rather annoying visuals on some moving objects. They were annoying bc there was zero mood elevation, zero mental effects, zero fun, lots of anxiety, muscle pain, and an overall terrible experience. Its a shame bc for the next 4 months I avoided LSD completely and had fun with nbome and shrooms. I&#039;ve done tons of research, talk, exchanges, etc with everyone associated with LSD, and know whats good, too bad im catch bunk out of cash for about two weeks...fuck ETM
