				Hey, I&#039;m in the same boat as you my friend... i have been waiting on my coins for 3 hours now....<br /><br />this is what i found online...<br /><br />I was sent some bitcoins and they haven&#039;t arrived yet! Where are they?<br />Don&#039;t panic! There are a number of reasons why your bitcoins might not show up yet, and a number of ways to diagnose them.<br />The latest version of the Bitcoin-Qt client will tell you how far it has to go yet in downloading the blockchain. Hover over the icon in the bottom right corner of the client to learn your client&#039;s status.<br />If it has not caught up then it&#039;s possible that your transaction hasn&#039;t been included in a block yet.<br />You can check pending transactions in the network by going here and then searching for your address. If the transaction is listed here then it&#039;s a matter of waiting until it gets included in a block before it will show in your client.<br />Bear in mind that if the transaction is based on a coin that was in a recent transaction then it could be considered a low priority transaction take longer to transfer if the transaction fee paid isn&#039;t high enough. Very low priority transactions with 0 fees might take hours or days to be included in a block.<br /><br /><br />there is a link as well to check on the status of the transfer.. here is the link<br /><br /><br />http://blockchain.info/<br /><br /><br />hope this helps and i hope we get our coins soon!

SR ANSWER MY EMAILS JESUS CHRIS!!!??<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Have you got any idea how many messages SR Support gets everyday?! Usually from new users just like you who have failed to read the information provided in the buyer&#039;s guide and on the forums. It can take up to 6 hours for Bitcoin confirmations here, and some people have reported 24+ hours before they see any coin. This is just something you&#039;ll need to learn to deal with. This isn&#039;t Amazon or eBay. There is a veritable skeleton crew manning the Support system, and they have to go through each message manually. If you need someone to hold your hand and whisper into your ear that you&#039;re special and different from everyone else, and that you&#039;ll be put to the top of the line because you have an urgent bet that you&#039;d like to place, you&#039;re in the wrong place.<br />So you can&#039;t bet on Rangers tonight - that&#039;s too bad. Next time have the foresight to spread your Bitcoin around. Don&#039;t keep it all in your SR account, and don&#039;t expect an immediate answer to your email. Some patience and a little respect for those who make this all possible wouldn&#039;t go astray.

				I&#039;m in the same boat. I sent 350 btc to anonibet from SR 13 hrs ago &amp; it still has not shown up. They also told me to check the blockchain, but SR doesn&#039;t show the withdrawal address under my account history.

				I withdrew this early this morning too and still now sign.&nbsp; I am not at all worried yet since a good tumbler takes a while at the best of times. But it would be nice for a SR person to respond, since there is obviously a technical issue going on here.

				this has happened before with withdrawls/deposits not showing. If i remember correctly they just have to switch to a back up wallet which takes many hours since not only do they have to download the entire block chain but do it over tor which makes it way slower. I&#039;m sure by tomorrow everything will be fixed. I would just relax SR has been here a long time and lots of little things like this have happened and they are always fixed no problem even with people freaking out like the sky is falling. SR has never let us down, it wont start now.
