I brought .5g local molly yesterday and some script pills &amp; I still have more left than I deposited :) But if it&#039;s agreed that the price will likely fall on the weekend, should I get all shopping spree tomorrow afternoon?

				Add this to your torbrowser&#039;s BookMarks Toolbar<br /><br />This is a clearnet site but it works well through tor also.<br />http://preev.com/<br /><br />Its a Bitcoin to USD converter which constantly updates from Mt.Gox&#039;s current price.<br />You can keep a TOR tab open with this page and the tab Label will tell you the current price of 1 BTC.<br />Or if you want you can change it from 1 to 120 BTC... and it will tell you the current value of 120BTC.<br />Its nice to be able to watch the price while you&#039;re surfing the road and forum.<br />Its also way better than using your Computer&#039;s Calculator program and the Multiply button.<br /><br />check it out.

				No matter the reason, I think that the price will fluctuate but continue to rise in the long run. That is for a couple of reasons. 1. The maximum number of bitcoins is finite while the market for their use is growing. I think that in the not too distant future we will see prices listed in mBTC 2. Its a really cool way to manage currency, I wish more non SR retailers would have a bitcoin option.

It was obviously a bubble - if anyone can look at the 6 month chart and tell me it&#039;s not they&#039;re fucking retarded.<br /><br />People in the BTC market as speculators are just dumb. They make the same mistakes over and over and over and over.<br /><br />I think the long term prospects are pretty good (largely because of sites like SR/BMR), but 110% month-on-month increase = correction incoming.
