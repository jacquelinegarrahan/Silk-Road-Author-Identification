				As much as I love Silk Road &amp; it will always be the benchmark site IMHO, a choice is always good. Apart from SR I have only found Black Market Reloaded &amp; they don&#039;t have many UK lists. Any other similar sites out there or is it just the 2?<br />&nbsp;;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D

				I also buy on BMR: <br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/<br /><br />I really like Black Market Reloaded. It&#039;s very small now and the selection reflects that, but personally I think it&#039;s on the verge of suddenly becoming really big. <br /><br />BMR does have a really solid escrow system in place. Many sellers will ask you to go outside of escrow (just like here at SR), but it&#039;s even more important to stay inside escrow at BMR because there is no fee to register a seller&#039;s account.<br /><br />I have made two sales at BMR and about ten purchases (from only three different sellers. All these transactions went swimmingly except for one in which I never heard back from the seller. Claiming my BTC back from escrow was quick and easy. The admins are active and responsive. And if you read the forums there, the website owner is working out the details for the next version of the site.

				There was a time, probably almost a year ago, when it was possible to get on Farmer&#039;s Market &amp; a few other sites.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t stick around because all the vendors sold only in large quantities.&nbsp; Open Vendor Database was probably the best alternative to SR, especially if you could find a seller who worked both sites.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s tougher now to get on these other sites because the current user base is distrustful of new members. Many of the other sites are just scams,

				So, the answer to the question of are there any viable Silk Road alternatives is without quarrel, no. <br /><br />And there we have it. <br /><br />6 Months from now things could be different but I doubt it. Perhaps a year from now there might be.

				Black Market Reloaded is the only SilkRoad-like place I know. For drugs the SR is the No.1 choice, but if ever cake hits the fan the BMR will be good alternative.

				BMR doesn&#039;t seem to have much in the way of user friendly features.&nbsp; You can&#039;t even keep track of your posts on the forum, there is no documentation for anything, and the people seem so wary of scams that nobody buys.&nbsp; Nobody leaves feedback either...&nbsp; I think cold calling would have a better conversion rate lol

				Ok, lets see it from different position. Can You give me good alternatives to eBay? I know a lot of places where I can buy cheaper or have items unavailable to eBay, but there is none close to eBay.<br /><br />BMR is good that it allowed all types of goods. Sure it needs to have some technical perfection but all comes with time.

In fact, I think CP is the only restricted category. They do sell guns, but I&#039;m pretty sure every current firearm listing is a scam... I have seen some interesting non-lethals offered from time to time. And of course the occasional listing for ex-military wet work (starting at $10k). Huge credit card dumps, counterfeit money... I have not seen any human organs yet. Anyway, all their rules and documents exist, but they aren&#039;t really arranged in a user-friendly way. It seems you have to really spend some time browsing the site to learn rules/policies bits at a time. That said, I can personally vouch for their escrow system and helpful admins. Plus we are all getting excited about the new site redesign coming soon.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of SR and what they&#039;re doing; I&#039;m also a big fan of BMR.<br />I have made more purchases and sent more BTC through BMR than SR. That&#039;s because I happened to find a guy selling AAA weed at an unbelievably good price. My impression was that he was testing the waters at BMR to prep for SR, because BMR does not charge for seller accounts. Well, he ended up selling through his entire harvest and didn&#039;t need to come here...<br /><br />BMR has no seller account fee and they take a smaller sales commission. This means that a lot of people with small quantities or one-off deals can still afford to bring their goods to the marketplace. It also means many, if not most, listings are posted by vendors with 0 feedback. You&#039;re pretty safe if you stay inside the escrow, but you&#039;re just asking for it if you finalize early. The selection is still pretty spotty, but I bet that will be changing soon.

The few dealers who operate in safer areas are just reselling stuff from the slums too, so they keep low stocks and charge a big surplus. That&#039;s the reality in any big city in Brazil.

				I have been a member of a private forum that does pretty much the same job as Silk Road for the last few years, although it is much more of a &#039;between friends&#039; kind of thing. As far as I am aware there are numerous forums and private communities like this, they tend not to be public due to security concerns (although I must say TSR&#039;s methods are ingenious). There are also a lot of RC and quasi-legal vendors that are legit. RC-supply is one.<br /><br />And to one saying why would we need to use another source, well it is a fact that a lot of the Silk Road&#039;s listings are very expensive.

				Well it looks as if whoever runs Black Market Reloaded invested in some forum software.<br /><br />It actually looks &quot;competitive&quot; over there on that side of the web.<br /><br />However, the vendors and pricing and selection leave much to be desired.<br /><br />I&#039;m an optimist&nbsp; though.
