				is that even if they know who these darkmarket operators are they cannot go after them without parallel evidence to cover their tracks. As long as the operators dont make IRL mistakes they have nothing to worry about.

Any good lawyer will make a crooked cops dick turn inside out. People like you think LE can do whatever they want because YOU LET THEM. Know your laws. That&#039;s how you keep the cops below them. I&#039;ve done it several times and I&#039;m not even a lawyer. People like you make cops think their above the law, and when you let them fuck you, they will fuck you. It&#039;s as simple as that.
