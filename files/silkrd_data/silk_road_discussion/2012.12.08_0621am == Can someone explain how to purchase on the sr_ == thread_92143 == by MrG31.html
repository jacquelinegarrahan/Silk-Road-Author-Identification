				OK now that you have coins go to your wallet and copy the wallet number (right click) and copy then go to where you bought coins and send them to the wallet number you copied they will take time but will arrive once there you will need to ship from your wallet to your SR wallet same thing highlight the SR wallet number and send your coins there.Once it arrives you can start shopping<br /><br />PGP is simple just download a PGP program and create a username and KEY once done you will have 2 parts public &amp; private you use the public keys and code with it so you will open the program and then go to clipboard type in your message and click encrypt copy it and send to what ever vendor and when he replies you high light that open your PGP and then paste in clipboard the click decrypt and thats that

If you mean how do you purchase a listing and skirt around escrow (bad idea), and fees, then you go to your &quot;account&quot; tab and put their wallet address in the &quot;Send bitcoins to another member&quot; field.

				You have received a couple of really cool replies which is no surprise, but i feel the need to give you fair warning.&nbsp; Everything you need to know is in the forums.&nbsp; It will be best for you to spend several days reading threads to obtain the knowledge you need.&nbsp; You stand a high risk of getting blasted on the forums for asking a question that has been answered over and over in the forums.&nbsp; Some will view this as lazy.&nbsp; I understand being new and posting a question to figure it out.&nbsp; It makes sense, but just so you know everything you need is already here.&nbsp; If you have read page after page for 5 days and still don&#039;t understand then ask a very detailed question and you&#039;ll be buying before you know it.<br />Good Luck to you!!!
