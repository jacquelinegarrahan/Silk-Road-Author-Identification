				I am curious about how other people do it.<br /><br />I was able to get bitcoins sent in to SR using bitinstant.&nbsp; I did a cash deposit at a service center of my choosing and used a fake name<br />so it was all anonymous.&nbsp; The coins showed up and everything seemed fine.&nbsp; I have read about others doing it this way.<br /><br />I am wondering if other people buy the coins legit, (real name and info) and then go through mixing services before sending them into SR.<br /><br />The reason I ask is because I have been burned in the past using fake names at service centers when the person entering the info makes a mistake<br />and then the money cannot get to its destination and I cannot get it back out because I do not have proper ID for the alias used at deposit time.<br />(got me for $350 once)<br /><br />Do you all think it&#039;s better to be anonymous at the deposit center, use a mixing service, or both?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Security thread would be a better place for this, it deals with BTC.<br /><br /><br />Personally, I use someone I found on localbitcoins.com, if you can find someone reliable there, it&#039;s easy sailing<br /><br /><br />Fake names shouldn&#039;t be used, there are places you can deposit without ID

None of our customers have ever reported being asked for ID when they deposit cash into our Bank of America account. We&#039;ve done quite a few now, so it seems to hold true across the country. <br /><br />And coins you get from us can&#039;t be traced back to a physical you, as long as you remain anonymous to us.<br /><br />Good luck with your search!<br />

				you can also mine your own coins. may be a bit slow but it&#039;s cheap and reliable.<br /><br />you can also buy and speculate via mtgopx

				I did look into mining bitcoins a while back with GPU&#039;s.&nbsp; Seemed like a good idea but it looked like I would spend more on electricity getting 1 coin than if I just bought them.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind depositing anonymously, just worry about the counter person screwing up and I am SOL.&nbsp; I think I am gonna look into the local bitcoin site shitwassocash cited above.<br /><br />Thanks folks.<br /><br />--

				Easiest way is BitInstant (zipZap payment at Walmart).&nbsp; No ID needed, and they usually (but not always) confirm the company name after entering the account number.&nbsp; If you are anonymous, then no need for mixing.
