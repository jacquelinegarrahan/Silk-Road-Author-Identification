				I know I put up a similar thread to this a couple weeks back but that was aimed the newbies, this is for every one and I think its a very very important part of SR as a whole.<br /><br />If people leave good feed back for a bad product this in the long term will create big problems for us the buyers because vendors think great I dont need to buy and sell a quality product anymore,&nbsp; these fools will take what ever rubbish I sell and still leave good feedback for me&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Before we know it SR is like the streets filled with bad drugs at stupid prices, I can see it happening already!<br /><br />We cant let top dog vendors take us for mugs, make sure you leave honest feedback, dont be afraid to say what you think!<br /><br />Some buyers need to remove their tongues from the vendors assssssss.<br /><br />Peace and all that :)

				I just wrote a negative feedback for some coke.&nbsp; <br />THe last two coke purchases were loaded with cut and nearly unusable.&nbsp; <br />Quality has gone down with the prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck, I paid top dollar for high heat last week and got mostly cut. <br /><br />I&#039;m not letting anyone get away with it anymore.&nbsp; If its shit, label it as shit . . I had some vendors write back and say they can give me the &#039;good stuff&#039; instead, like most customers are willing to accept the regular shit stuff?<br /><br />I got killer stats and no reason to lie and I never ask for a refund or anything like that, so they know I&#039;m serious and not looking for free goods.&nbsp; I try not to lower the rating number too much, but write a detailed feedback instead.<br /><br />I hope quality can improve or at least the labeling of items that are more truthful .&nbsp;

				+1<br /><br />Whats the point of having a variable ratings system if everyone gives 5/5 regardless of the outcome?!<br /><br />Tongues in Asses is dead right. Too many hot chocolate drinkers here that really need to be drinking some concrete.

				Why not lower their rating number? That&#039;s really the best weapon in an honest buyer&#039;s arsenal for recourse when the vendor vends bullshit product. Fuck that shit dude. You&#039;re paying top dollar to sit a few days and patiently wait only to receive a bunch of cut and then be offered &quot;ok ok, will send ya the good stuff? Punish that vendor so that other buyers don&#039;t get fucked and that other vendors realize there is a consequence for such shenanigans. On the other hand, when receiving fantastic product, give them 5/5 and the best feedback you can possibly muster. My philosophy atleast.

				Its human nature, give us an inch we take a mile, sell some shit coke and no one complains we keep the good stuff and sell the shit stuff.<br /><br />Jedi that&#039;s a perfect example of how vendors are now thinking they can take the piss, keeping the good stuff? for what?? a rainy fucking day! <br /><br />This is not the streets where you have to know a guy who knows a guy who can get you the good stuff, this is supposed to be the place where you get the good stuff, +1 to you for being honest, keep it up!<br /><br />We all need to stop with the over excitement when writing feedback.&nbsp; I myself am guilty of this and I have set myself a few rules about leaving feedback no matter how much of a &#039;&#039;cool guy&#039;&#039; the vendor is, its time to take back control people, we call the shots around here, not the vendors, remember that!<br /><br />

				I gotta admit, when I first saw the thread I thought &quot;Who ripped this guy off&quot; but as I read it I couldn&#039;t agree more. I try to keep anything I review objective but I&#039;m sure I could be accused of being a little overzealous at times. Like you eluded to, it may just be from a great feeling that comes from getting a phat bag of dank in the mail but it&#039;s important to be honest about everything. You can still be critical of things without being an asshole and I&#039;ve always tried to do so. But you&#039;re right. This is supposed to be where we come to get good shit. The only way to ensure that is through feedback and little reminders like this help to keep it on point.
