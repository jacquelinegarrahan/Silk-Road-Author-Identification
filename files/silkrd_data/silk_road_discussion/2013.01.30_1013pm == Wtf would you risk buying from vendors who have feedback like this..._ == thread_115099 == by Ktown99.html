				A couple of samples of feedback about two separate vendors:<br /><br />&quot;The package arrived exactly when the seller said it would. product looks good but haven&#039;t tried it yet. stealth was unexistent&quot;<br /><br />&quot;5 working days in uk, dodgy package..&quot;<br /><br />&quot;weed is strong BUT not the best quality...the package isn&#039;t the best..&quot;<br /><br />Fuck me.

				Just because a person is a vendor doesn&#039;t make them smart or reliable. Just takes a 500 deposit. <br /><br />There are a lot of people with good feedback as well. <br /><br />Don&#039;t take risks if you are not comfortable.

				I didn&#039;t think you would since you started the thread. I was just agreeing they were crappy stats.<br /><br />Some people must have ordered from him though. Sadly some people don&#039;t care and take chances. There are so many vendors with excellent stealth rating and feedback. <br /><br />It&#039;s just as important as quality and price. <br /><br />Never think it can never happen to you. You never know when they are going to crack down and make examples out of people.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t feel right even if you can&#039;t put your finger on it. Just don&#039;t.

				That&#039;s right and I don&#039;t either.<br /><br />I think that some new people just feel grateful that anyone will work with them so they take the risk.<br /><br />Just because you are new that does not mean the vendor doesn&#039;t have to earn your trust as well. <br /><br />Guess we are the only 2 people following this thread.&nbsp;
