				197 000 BTC * $6.5 = $1 930 500<br />I think it&#039;s one of the original developers, or somebody who invested in bitcoin bigtime (probably at an early stage, even at the early stages of bitcoin it still had to be an investment of $18 000). Or maybe somebody is just a very creative tax evader. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an SR vendor, they need the liquidity too much to save so many bitcoins.<br /><br />Also, you see there 21 accounts with exactly 10 000 BTC on them. It is very likely that some of them are owned by the same person.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think we are going to find out. Very interesting post though. Thanks.

				seems like a giant waste of money to hold up everything you own in a ecurrency that could fail at any time and is basically useless in actual life...

				Yes. But if it gets widely accepted, then prices will sky rocket. A few news reports or movie reference, might already cause that. And then, that person might become a billionaire.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking at previous posts of that blog, and then you see there&#039;s a lot of &#039;moving&#039; going on. In August 2011, there are over 30 accounts with 10 000 btc in them. And the top account has something like 100 000 in it. Then, if you look in December, 10 of those with ten thousand have disappeared, and the top account has almost 300 000 in it. <br /><br />So I get the impression that many of those accounts are owned by the same person or group, who in reality is even richer than we think.

				DPR must be bossing it come to think of it<br /><br />Whatever strategy he has for cashing out without drawing attention must be genius. Because from a statistical point of view, you can spot an SR tumbler ages away.<br /><br />I just hope security is as good as we think it is.

				he&#039;s not really worth $3m.&nbsp; if he dumped all those coins onto the market right now it would crash the market and he&#039;d lose a bunch of money. to put it another way, is there anyone out there looking to buy $3 million in bitcoins? no.&nbsp; so he&#039;s kinda stuck with them.

				I think it&#039;s pretty obvious that whoever set up bitcoins was going to reap it in big. I mean it&#039;s an unregulated stock market pretty much and I would think if normal brokers can figure out how to manipulate the real market then the inventors of the btc can figure out how to manipulate their own market and have probably all along meant to reap the benefits. I am still convinced the gov or someone in it is in charge of this whole thing no matter how crazy I sound.

				Without a doubt he&#039;s waiting until 2017-ish when there are no more Bitcoins to be mined, the price of Bitcoins will rocket and the currency will then become unusable, he&#039;ll be our &#039;savior&#039; and release his stockpile into the market at ludicrous prices and then cash out.
