				Hey gang,<br /><br />We&#039;ve got a bug somewhere that&#039;s causing some actions on the site to be glitchy.&nbsp; Like items not being added/removed from the cart, actions on the order page not showing up, and so on.&nbsp; It looks like it is a cache issue somewhere, so we are working on fixing it.&nbsp; Until we do, if you experience one of these glitches, just hit ctrl+f5 on your keyboard and your browser will refresh with the most up-to-date version of the page you are on.

				<br />Man, does the shopping cart have issues. It took me a half dozen logins&nbsp; to make a purchase. When I would hit purchase 1 item it would refresh with 2 of the same item in the cart.<br />Then I would try to update cart back to 1 and it would add a 3rd. Then I tried to go to 0 and it would stay stuck on 3 unless I updated to 0 and logged out at the same time. Then logged back in and it would be back to 1 again and when I hit purchase I would go through the same routine again. I thought I was stuck in groundhog day............LOL. Finally after a half dozen to a dozen logins, I got my order placed. F5 didn&#039;t help, another tab didn&#039;t help. I just hope I didn&#039;t order 6 of the same item..........................................................LMFAO.<br />I&#039;m sure SR will get these little glitches sorted out in time. They always do.<br /><br />Bikerbum

				can anyone else confirm reinstallation of TOR solves this?&nbsp; i thought this was a glitch in the site programming and not the client side.&nbsp; seems like people are having trouble placing orders as my orders have dropped 80%-90%

				Ctrl + F5 is not helping with the &quot;You must select a postage option&quot; problem.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this something the seller needed to select beforehand, but I can&#039;t place an order right now.&nbsp; Perhaps a default shipping option should be added.

				After you select the postage option, you must press the &#039;Go&#039; button underneath or beside the drop down postage choice list.<br /><br />If you select a postage and try to proceed without first pressing &#039;Go&#039; and waiting for the page to reload, it will give you that error.<br /><br />It&#039;s not very intuitive, but it does work.

				Man, this is how rumours and panic get started.<br /><br />Yes, there was someone previously posting with a fake account with a name similar to Silk Road.<br /><br />However, the thread starter in this case is in fact the real Silk Road administrators account, and he neglected to sign his post. You&#039;ll note if you search the threadstarters post history he&#039;s had numerous properly PGP signed posts since then.<br /><br />Generally speaking, it&#039;s only important that mission critical posts are signed - like when we&#039;re changing URLs without any notice. A thread such as this saying there are issues on the site and they&#039;re being worked on may not have rated as critical enough for SR to sign it; and there is also the small but distinct possibility that being human, he forgot this time.<br /><br />It&#039;s nothing to get all our panties up in a bunch about, but SR should make it best practices to sign all his posts, all the time, to avoid any doubt.<br /><br />
