				Hello, anonaghost. <br /><br />Start by reading official SR wiki ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page ). If you still have questions use the forum search function. If you still have questions, then make a thread like this one!<br /><br />Best of luck,<br />Bob

				Problem packages are only due to vendor mishaps of the packaging itself, if it is properly done you have no problem. We take up MAYBE .1% of packages so it isn&#039;t a big deal.<br /><br />For your first buy on silkroad, I would not finalize early, and find a seller who is above the top 90 sellers. <br /><br />And I have never used PGP

				Your identity is the most important piece of information you&#039;ll share on this website. It is in your interest to use means such as PGP to keep your address as secure as possible.<br /><br />There is a steep learning curve for PGP but once you get the hang of it encrypting information is simple. <br /><br />I recommend using gpg4win.org

				Concerning PGP encryption... these are the guides that helped me...<br /><br />Start with this: <br /><br />http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/guides/shepj.html<br /><br />Then when you get confused this should clear things up.
