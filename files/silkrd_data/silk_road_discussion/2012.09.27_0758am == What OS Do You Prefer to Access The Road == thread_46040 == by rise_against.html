				Linux and android user though also triple boot my computers and laptop between microsoft ubuntu and liberte. The site you access is no different in anyway across the board of OS. Though i feel Linux is much easier to customize and create a much more anonymous and secure connection being open source. I look at microsoft like a narc. Ever hit cntrl alt del and see the programs running on windows that have nothing to do with anything your doin or running? Yea half of those are not required at all and that makes me not trust microsoft

				I use a dedicated laptop that does not have a HDD or a battery with a 8gb linux liberte boot stick.&nbsp; The non battery thing is not by choice, the computer just didnt have one, lol! i got it from a friend a looong time ago as just a piece of plastic that didnt work, now i use it every single day.&nbsp; I must say since SR started i did not use a computer that much and didnt even know what linux was, when i decided I wanted to try and do the vendor thing it took me a good 5-6 months preparing for it, I really cannot believe how much I have learned in so little time.&nbsp; I now have 4 laptops and a very large variety of OS&#039;s and programs, very happy I put the time in

I bet most people don&#039;t even know that you can install a different OS on the computers they buy, and the computer store doesn&#039;t have a linux (or BSD) computer in stock, and they don&#039;t want to have to order one special.

Last year fucking LE came with a search warrant and he simply shoved the USB stick up his ass. The pigs took every single bit of computer equipment with them but they never found any evidence because all sensitive data was encrypted and up his ass ;D<br />He would have gone to jail for like ten years if they had gotten that data. So it&#039;s not &quot;excessive&quot; to use a HDD-less laptop with a boot stick ;)

				SR definitely made me a more secure and &quot;paranoid&quot; Internet user! Before SR, I would just download illegal things, look at drugs, etc, all on my regular Internet. Pirated things, forever. But now, I re-formatted ALL my computers, made sure there is no pirated software and every thing is activated. But I just have a single 8gb USB stick that I installed Liberte on and have ALL of my illegal information on. It&#039;s amazing compared to my last setup. And considering I have a few computers, I can run the USB on any one I choose. I mainly use my laptop though, for portable reasons.<br /><br />For some reason recently though, when I boot Liberte on my desktop, the mouse works until I connect to the internet, then it stops working. I have a feeling it disables the USB ports on my motherboard for some reason?

I had just got a brand new little gateway notebook for the sole purpose of this website but for some reason could not get the network driver to connect to the internet with liberte, and still cant till this day (dont think its compatible with linux) and I actually didnt find out till recently that this is all in my favor, and Im usin it right now!!&nbsp; fuck yea
