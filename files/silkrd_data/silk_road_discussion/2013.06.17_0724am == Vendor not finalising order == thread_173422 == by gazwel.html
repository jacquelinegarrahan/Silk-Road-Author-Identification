				Hi all,<br /><br />Basically I made an order with a vendor last Monday and I received the order a few days later. The problem is the vendor has not marked it as &quot;in transit&quot; so I can&#039;t finalise it.<br /><br />I have sent a polite message but no reply and the vendor has not been online in 3 days, getting a bit paranoid that my address is still on the system and I want to cancel it but I did get my product (couple grams of weed) and I know if I cancel it SR takes the fees anyway and I would end up out of pocket when the guy asks for his money back.<br /><br />What is the best thing for me to do here?

				I don&#039;t think you understand what I meant, I have the order and the vendor has not marked in transit. So my address is still on the system until he does that or I cancel. Also, he has not signed in for 3 days which makes me more paranoid.

				Did you encrypt your address with PGP? If you did you have nothing to worry about. If you didn&#039;t remember to do it next time so in the case something as this happens you are less anxious and more secure.<br /><br />Anyway you can cancel yourself the order if the vendor doesn&#039;t put it in transit in 4 days, so you should be able to do it tomorrow (if 3 days are already passed).<br /><br />EDIT: Hmmm, sorry, didn&#039;t read well your question also if still I don&#039;t get in full what you said. You have fear that the vendor already sent you the shipment? If he hasn&#039;t put the order in transit in 99% of the cases he surely didn&#039;t, so you can cancel the order without problems. If then you will receive the order because he did send it without marking it in transit he will just have to make you a custom listing for you to put your BTC in.<br /><br />In any case this is a fault of the vendor, so if you are paranoid about your address (because you didn&#039;t encrypt it) security concerns comes first and you have all the rights to cancel the order if the vendor has not put it in transit before 4 days.

				Don&#039;t like waiting around so I just cancelled it, but I am keeping the money in my account for now to give to the vendor when he messages me.
