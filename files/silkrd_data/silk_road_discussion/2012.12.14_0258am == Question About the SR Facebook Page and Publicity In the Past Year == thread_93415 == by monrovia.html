				Title: <strong>Question About the SR Facebook Page and Publicity In the Past Year</strong><br />

				So I noticed a few weeks ago that SR has a facebook page that seems to be endorsed by DPR, and I&#039;m pretty sure he&#039;s agreed to being interviewed for more than one of the articles that were written that caused the sudden boost in popularity/awareness of SR. These articles all have a fair amount of comments from people who seem to be pissed off about the website being talked about in the open. The facebook thing, and the fact that DPR has given interviews to aid the writing of these articles makes me think that he/she/they are fairly confident that the marketplace will survive the increased attention directed towards it, and possibly believe it to be very beneficial.<br /><br />So, my question is, how do y&#039;all senior members really feel about all this? I&#039;m curious to find out whether you think it&#039;s good, bad, or otherwise, and if I&#039;m completely missing the mark by thinking that DPR thinks the publicity is even a remotely good idea...

				^^<br /><br />Well, one thing gave me the impression it was. When I saw it, it was around the time that the site was down in November. When we got the last update, I noticed that the FB page gave the same update what seemed immediately after or at the same time as it being posted in the forums. I know we don&#039;t know who DPR is, that&#039;s why I referred to him/her/them as he/she/they in my post. I just got the impression that maybe it was being maintained by someone who was &quot;In the loop&quot; so to speak. Maybe my assumption is outlandish if so, I apologize. Someone definitely could just be maintaining it because they think they are doing a good thing by spreading the word I guess. I don&#039;t know...

Firstly us, coin providers, postage companys, LE, etc. :P

				I&#039;m pretty sure both the FB page and the &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; twitter account are just fanbois.&nbsp; The official SR twitter may be legit.<br /><br />He didn&#039;t agree to be interviewed for my SR piece, which was the first in-depth mainstream Australian feature, but he did say he appreciated me reporting on SR and then wrote afterwards to say he liked it.

The gawker article talks about things that an &quot;administrator&quot; who had the name &quot;silkroad&quot; on the forums told them in an email. And I thought another article mentioned quotes from DPR, but if I remembered incorrectly about this, I probably did about that too.
