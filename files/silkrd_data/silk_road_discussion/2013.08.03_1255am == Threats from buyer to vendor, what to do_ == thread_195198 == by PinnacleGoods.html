				So, we put this in the PinnacleGoods vendor review thread, but thought to share it here as well to get an idea what the larger group thinks is appropriate to do when a buyer threatens a vendor.<br /><br />PinnacleGoods just got this from anonymouse123 for refusing to take their order because of their buyer stats, and then their attitude - which was really bad.&nbsp; We don&#039;t work with people with bad attitudes.<br /><br />Oh, and anonymouse123 said this too:<br />&quot;if you google my name you can see i got busted with 34k and a dozen different drugs including several thousand pills last year i don&#039;t fuck people over i do legit business.&quot;<br /><br />WOW! In this country, you do not go free if you are busted with &quot;34k and a dozen different drugs including several thousand pills&quot;, unless you cooperated with law enforcement.&nbsp; So, someone mentions this and thinks it will make us want to do business with them, because they got busted with lots of drugs and didn&#039;t do any time? REALLY???<br /><br />We were cordial as always:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />From PinnacleGoods:<br /><br />We choose who we do business with carefully to try and avoid problems. We do not have time to send messages back and forth like this. We do not answer to you, things do not have to make sense to you. This is our business, and we run it the way that makes sense to us. We choose to do business with people who we feel we will have good experiences with, and for the most part this strategy of carefully selecting clients has been a very successful one for us.<br /><br />Sorry but we must place you on our blacklist. Please do not send us any additional messages, we will not reply to them and we will not sell any product to you. We wish you nothing but the best, but we can not do any business with you.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Pinnacle Goods Group<br /><br />-----<br /><br />We got this threat in response from anonymouse123:<br /><br />&quot;your a fucking POS. if you would have just answered me from the beginning this conversation wouldn&#039;t have lasted so long. your the most ridiculous mother fucker on here. YOU made this happen. instead of saying &quot;please contact us if you have any questions&quot; you should have said &quot;fuck you i&#039;m cancelling your order and if you ask why i will ignore you and then blacklist you&quot;. your going to regret being a stubborn little prick, i&#039;ll see to that. i&#039;m going to fucking ruin you. i have several accounts many with much better stats and since i have nothing better to do with these bitcoins i&#039;ll use them to ruin your reputation. enjoy the 100% positive feedback while it last. ignorant fucking ass hole. your not even going to see it coming. i actually ordered some versed off of you not too long ago. hope it was worth it prick.&quot;<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Vendor Support and SR Support were already notified of this via PM.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />So, SR staff, vendors, buyers, spies, hangers-on, and everyone else, what should be done when a buyer says &quot;i&#039;m going to fucking ruin you&quot; and goes on to tell about how they &quot;have several accounts many with much better stats and since i have nothing better to do with these bitcoins i&#039;ll use them to ruin your reputation.&quot;?<br /><br />Would you just ignore them?<br /><br />Would you fight fire with fire?<br /><br />Or does anyone have similar stories they think might be appropriate to share?<br /><br />

				&#039;Internet Tough Guys&#039; should never be taken too seriously. You have what at your disposal? Escrow to avoid the &#039;I didn&#039;t get the package&#039; accusations, a DCN number. Is this guy going to spend money with you from several different accounts just to give bad feedback? Doubt it.

				You&#039;re a new vendor. You&#039;re going to have to deal with all kinds of buyer crap until you get established. Your feedback is vulnerable to anything less than a 5/5. And they know it. <br /><br />You may even get attacked by a rival rogue vendor if they don&#039;t like your prices. <br /><br />Just do the best business you can. It&#039;ll all work out in the end. Serious buyers will see the odd feedback that sticks out and deduce that it&#039;s some asshat trying to extort you or some rival rogue vendor trying to ruin your stats. <br /><br />It sucks. But in a few weeks you won&#039;t even care anymore.

				I agree. Look at what the idiot said, &quot;I got busted IRL with blah blah blah, google my name!&quot; what a fucking idiot. <br />I doubt he will pay for product to leave bad feedback, and for every asshole there should be 5 good guys. You dd nothing wrong and made a good choice outing him. ;)<br />All the best

				how many &#039;good&#039; accounts is he really likely to have? 3? 5? <br /><br />If you start receiving a few 1/5 feedbacks, at least you&#039;ll know which accounts are his. I&#039;d imagine SR would be prepared to scrub some if not all of those from your record since you&#039;ve already raised the issue with them and you&#039;re expecting it to happen.<br /><br />And they may even be prepared to ban the accounts which left you the 1/5&#039;s. <br /><br />So in summary, you may yet escape this with no real problems. And he may lose all the &#039;good&#039; accounts he supposedly has. <br /><br />And if SR refuse to scrub the bad feedbacks and ban his accounts... well then all you can do then is ensure you explain where the 1/5&#039;s come from and link to this page from your vendor page.

				like i said later on i didn&#039;t really have any intention on doing that i was just trying to piss him off in the only way i possibly could. he cancelled an order on me for no good reason at all which was hedged and i lost like 5% of my bitcoins. did not give two shits. and also said to contact him if i had any questions, i did just that and got blacklisted. this guys a fool and he brought it on himself. and stop complaining so much guy. if you don&#039;t like it here then leave. all i hear you do is complain constantly about everything. i just wanted to know what was going on and this dick had to make things extremely difficult. i wasted $60 in fees getting the bitcoins to order this from him. so yeah i got a little pissed off.

				If you have something on your stats that might make a vendor think twice, message the vendor before ordering. If the vendor commits, then place an order. <br /><br />If you spent that much in fees to get coin, why not take the extra simple step to ensure a vendor won&#039;t cancel on you? A vendor doesn&#039;t owe a buyer any explanation for why they cancelled an order. It is nice to let a buyer know why though. <br /><br />Now, you probably need to ask vendors before ordering if they will accept your order from here on out. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Next time just come on the forums and request your desired product, then there will be a list of vendors willing to assist you. Forget this prick, he had no right to cancel your order. <br />Hate the way they think there fucking God or DPR, you are not, so why can&#039;t us buyers leave some feedback stating why the order was cancelled. I hope there&#039;s a time, you can&#039;t afford to be picking and choosing your buyers.

				thanks for the replies guys. yeah i&#039;m always going to make sure to send the vender a message before ordering anything from now on i just never thought of it before. i&#039;m kind of new here, i&#039;ve only made a hand full of transactions. no bad stats just not much to go by i guess. i just wanted to make sure i replied on here because i noticed over 500 people have looked at this thread and it&#039;s not as bad as he&#039;s making it seem. i know i probably shouldn&#039;t have said those things it was kind of childish i should have just let it go. luckily i was able to order the product i wanted from someone else and it should be here soon.

				Don&#039;t you have to have a vendor tag under your name to get into the private vendor section? Isn&#039;t that where blacklists are? <br /><br />Some sellers put a blacklist on their profile page to explain who and why bad feedback was left. <br /><br />By now, if anyone&#039;s been on SR long enough, as a buyer when you see that one 1/5 sitting between a bunch of 5/5s you kind of know what the deal is and ignore it. And you think to yourself, &quot;aha, that numbnuts is getting blacklisted.&quot;&nbsp;

				he was here for a month and made 75 transactions. he was complaining a lot about all the messages he had to answer everyday. i saw him post things on his page like if all the whining doesn&#039;t stop he will be out of here soon. kind of ironic complaining about people complaining. part of being a vendor is having to deal with complaints and questions if you have that many customers you must be making a lot of money.

				I was cancelled by 2 seperate vendors in a row from overseas. I wrote them both a message and only 1 replied with &#039;Maybe we dont ship to your country&#039; which they said they do on the vendor page. I just wrote them a &#039;Thankyou for your time&#039; and took my business elsewhere. I lost money cos of hedged too.<br /><br />I have made a few orders now and spent maybe $800 but with about 28 transactions. The only reason I have that many is because of the lotteries. I didnt know beforehand that vendors tsometimes think you are trying boost your stats...I literally play them to try win coin :p. If the vendors looked closer they would see they are $20-30 per game instead of $1 games...Really regret playing them now because I dont want vendors having to think twice when I place an order :(

				It stinks that we can&#039;t &quot;all just get along&quot;.<br />There is a great community here, but with the subject matter, bad seeds are going to be a part of life.<br />I have lurked for a long time before starting to make purchases, which I have done recently. <br />Most of my transactions have been great so far, and I have had a couple of vendors cancel my order without shipment. I did not bother them to clarify why, I just assume it is because I am a n00b buyer at this point.<br /><br />I am a customer, but I don&#039;t act like an asshole. The vendors are here risking a lot to try to provide me with something that I would have a hard time getting elsewhere. I treat them with respect, and want to be treated the same way.
