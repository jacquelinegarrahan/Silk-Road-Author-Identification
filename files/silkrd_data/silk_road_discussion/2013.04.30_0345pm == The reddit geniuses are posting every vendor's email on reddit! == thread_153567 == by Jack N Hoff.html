				The thread has finally been deleted.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to leave this here so the SR users have an easy place to get the emails and so hopefully they don&#039;t pull that shit again.&nbsp; If you would like your email removed just let me know.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">MODS: Can we sidebar this if it keeps growing?<br /><br />UPDATE: OP will return, I have an exam<br /><br />UPDATE: tormail is apparently online, according to you<br /><br />ALSO: UPVOTE THE THREAD. I see alot of comments and no votes. If no one votes, this will slip into the depths of reddit and will be a waste of time. If everyone contributes, we can build something great.<br /><br />Alright so everyone should post vendor emails, just in case SR is down for even longer than the latest estimates. I&#039;ll update this post once people begin to comment.<br /><br />*I imagine that many vendors won&#039;t do business with you unless you have previously been a customer, but it&#039;s worth compiling this anyways.

				its&nbsp; a clearnet site so there are alot of people who dont even use SR that like to snoop in the SR sub reddit and this could just lead to fuckery. anybody can flood the vendors email with bullshit and would force them to maybe even ignore all messages or worst delete there email account. and if SR (God Forbid) doesnt come back up for awhile it would spell disaster for the vendors that would try to do&nbsp; business through their tormail which i think now is highly unlikely. basically you just quadrople the amount of attention you want and trust me, the mugles on reddit emailing you just to be cool is not the attention you want as a vendor trying to make a living.

				Ok, I get that... <br /><br />But to be completely honest, downloading Tor and accessing the SR Forums is like the easiest thing ever. You can literally google &quot;Silk Road Forum&quot; and this site pops up. It is not much more security than anywhere else, if you&#039;re trying to keep emails a secret...

				It&#039;s fucking clearnet!<br /><br />They are going to get a shit load of emails from random people now.<br /><br />Some of those emails are clearnet emails that can be easily monitored or banned.<br /><br />Illegal activity is actually against tormail policy so tormail could even close accounts.<br /><br />Bots also crawl the clearnet looking for emails so they can add them to lists to spam.
