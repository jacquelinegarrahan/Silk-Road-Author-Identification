				Thanks to The Guardian news site.&nbsp; It&#039;s a glowing report of our *growing* community :)<br /><br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace<br /><br />I just love the comments at the bottom. I think we&#039;re going to have our work cut out as vendors!!

The word is out now though, like you said, they&#039;re not reporting anything new. Having said that, I did stop and think for a short while, would they station a drugs dog at every post room in the country? Then I realised, that will never happen. As a country we have neither the funds nor the inclination (at the moment). At the very least though, any vendors who aren&#039;t using dog proof barriers should definitely start consider using them!<br /><br />The day I pay one penny in taxes to the UK Government for the weed I grow, is the day I&#039;ll quit and get a job :)<br /><br />

				That was a good article. Almost as good as the British GQ article.<br /><br />I see no reason to &quot;fly below the radar&quot;. SR was on the radar a long time ago and the technology behind it has proven to be effective at protecting SR and us. Every media report increases the size of the community with no proportional increase in the threats against us, so these media reports are beneficial overall. They lead to new customers, new vendors, and new products. We all win.<br /><br />

				I realize this isn&#039;t some super secret club, but I still kinda wish it was less talked about. I feel like for every news article on this, more buyers come in whereas not as many vendors do. More people yields more demand which increases prices that vendors can charge and makes it harder to get products. It also is nice to be the guy in my area with the best stuff to resell. Still, well written article.

				You can feel it in their words, what compositions of vituperation and venom, when referring to DPR&#039;s income!!!! a cool Â£1 million a month unreal, what percent is he taking? 10% 20% and the rest. The Daily Mail actually must have stakes in BTC they never fail to mention how to install Tor and the free download. Suspicious ?

				The guardian is always good for fair articles, i wouldnt look to the daily mail for any resourceful information. Have to agree that media isnt going to have any influence on how determined law enforcement are. They&#039;re probably on it with all their resources already, they must be pissed that their very own creation came back to bite them in the ass so hard.<br /><br />All media attention is only more sales for the road now :-)
