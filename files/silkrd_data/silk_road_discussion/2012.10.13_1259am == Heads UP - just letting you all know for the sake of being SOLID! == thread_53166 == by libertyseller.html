				&nbsp;I am taking a small trip starting Saturday- will not have access to shipping- as a result will be going into vacation mode - but will be active Monday first thing. <br /><br />ALL orders made today have either been shipped or will be shipped in the AM! <br /><br />You will all get your orders asap- IF anyone has any problems contact me via my sellers account, I will be logging in to check messages- I just wont have product to ship so need to ensure no one waits to long :) <br /><br /><br />Thank you all for understanding.

I didn&#039;t want to come off like I was just being a dick.. I honestly get what he wwas trying to say...it is just a terrible title and even as you read it..your not quite sure what he is talking about. Even the message could have been written better..<br /><br />Now me being the dick part...So I went to his vendor page.(That&#039;s where he should have written this) and in a month he has like 4 sales. He list 1 product and I can&#039;t imagine he had but 1 or 2 customers that he could have just sent this message to them. And put this post in the rumor forum.<br /><br />That being said you can&#039;t hate on a vendor that is trying to do the right thing! If you were a customer then you would love this. And I know everyone that reads this hates when they place and order and then can&#039;t get a hole of a vendor.<br /><br />This is a good chance to tell any buyer out there..When you are going to place an order and you have no history with the vendor...it is a good idea to contact the vendor first. I read a lot of post from buyers that placed and order and then realize the vendor has not logged in for a while. So always read the vendors page first. No matter how many times you have dealt with them. All good vendors will update if something comes up. And if you are a first time buyer with that vendor. Then send them a message first and let them know you are ready to place an order right now you just wanted to make sure it is all good.<br /><br />One other thing...don&#039;t message a vendor days before you are going to order to give us a heads up. That it to many days and we are to busy. And a lot of those buyers never come thru. So message us when you are actually ready not days before.
