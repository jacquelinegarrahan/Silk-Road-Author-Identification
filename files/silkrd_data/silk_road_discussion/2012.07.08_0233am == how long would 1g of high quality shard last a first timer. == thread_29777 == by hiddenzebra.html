				To my understanding about 1/20 of a gram should get you euphoric and speeding for 6-12 hours. 1/10 of a gram and you can pull an all niter easily and stay up the whole next day until that following night. Depending on the quality I feel I may even be overshooting the recommended dose. Be extremely careful, a gram is definitely enough to enjoy and experiment with for a few weeks. I have never done meth before though.

				It all depends on how much you like it and how it makes you feel. I could go through a gram of shard dope in a little over a day if I was so inclined. Being as it is you first time, you will probably have it around for a while longer. I agree with the last poster; start with extremely small lines and wait 30 minutes to an hour before taking another. You will eventually find your sweet spot without getting spun out and becoming useless. Too much and you really can&#039;t get anything done. Just enough will take you places.<br /><br />Be careful though; some people have an affinity to dope and will do as much as they can get their hands on after trying the first few times. Bad scene to be into.<br /><br />oxyhoot
