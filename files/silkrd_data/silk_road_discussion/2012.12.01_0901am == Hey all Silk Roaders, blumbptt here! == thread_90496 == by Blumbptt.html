				I&#039;m new here this year. So I guess you could say I&#039;m new to the boards. Already I&#039;ve posted a couple of threads about things that I needed to know. For those of you who read my thread in the Security Section may have learned that I have a great interest in starting my own TOR based network. I just need the best step by step directions to setting the tor site up in the process for the highest level of safety and security and of course, anonymity everywhere, even in IRC.<br />I&#039;m also interested in creating my own BitCoin Payment webpages that has everything that everyone wants in a nice fast, no ID&nbsp; required, unlimited amount of money you can use, etc. <br />So if anyone wants to let it off their chest about what bothers them about their favorite bitcoin website page I&#039;ll be sure not to do that, also if someone could write me a guide or find me a guide on how to create a hidden service site.<br />And about how many people work for SR, because that&#039;s probably going to have to be close to the amount of people I&#039;ll need for my forum directory. And what different jobs are there?<br />I know that&#039;s a lot for an introduction, but... wtvr. I can&#039;t wait for my opiates to get here this week

				It would be really difficult to do all that from scratch. :0 A lot goes into something like what you&#039;re suggesting; experienced, educated people don&#039;t even have an easy time with it.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t help much, Tor and network things aren&#039;t an area I&#039;m that well versed in... but there might be things to help you on the Hidden Wiki?<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: shoot, Mal deleted his post. Not sure why all these &quot;Introduction&quot; threads are popping up, there&#039;s a place to introduce yourself.. ah well, at least this one has more substance to it than just &quot;hello&quot;

				I&#039;m no genius but I&#039;d say the bitcoin forum and the tor forum would be a great place to start.
