				so I ordered a nice half gram of psilocin&#039;s fantastic H over this precious weekend&nbsp; ;) and I am soooo excited for it to arrive. but chances are, it will be at least a whole damn week before it does! ahhhhhhh&nbsp; :o :o :o :o now, I used to be a daily user but have recently weened myself back - which is a great thing about SR, you are forced to wait days for dope, effectively lower your tolerance (if you choose not to use) and, therefore, making the product last longer. so now that I am more fucking sober than I have been the last 15 years of my life, what the hell is there to do while I wait?? I can&#039;t really afford to go cop off the street for shit dope (nor, do I want to, not worth it) - SR has made me kind of spoiled now&nbsp; ;) I mean, I work. but common. what do you guys do while you wait for your letter to arrive? how can one be so patient?? wouldn&#039;t it be great if we could just fax everything - including our drugs?? man, the future will be awesome. but now I have to wait. wait. wait. damnit this suckss

				ha I was not expecting any responses. just a bored ramble. but yes, sleeping the day away is great - on days off. I mean I figure if I&#039;m not working, why sit around and watch tv when you can sleep sleep sleep. dreams are better than life anyway. masturbating is great. but that only lasts so long&nbsp; ;) and I do play a couple instruments. bass and drums actually. and I&#039;m also a writer and heavy reader. I have just recently gotten into the A Song of Fire and Ice series (Game of Thrones) - and haven&#039;t really been able to put them down. its fucking porn for nerds. or heroin. which ever. nonetheless, those damn books are awesome and sooooooo addicting. seriously, they&#039;re incredible. I highly recommend them to...well, anyone and everyone, really.
