				you can place as many as you see fit. only thing that would differ would be if it<br />was &quot;hedged&quot; or &quot;unhedged&quot;.&nbsp; if you have many places to order than why not. lol

You can encrypt your address for multiple vendors and there are guides on how to do that available in this very forum. A search will turn them up.<br /><br />Whilst PGP isn&#039;t required to make a purchase, it is necessary for your own safety. You should be acting at ALL times as though Silk Road is compromised - if you do not, you will inevitably let your guard down. There are countless reasons why you don&#039;t want to be sending your name and address to vendors in cleartext.<br /><br />Learn how to use PGP, it literally takes less than an hour to wrap your head around as much as you need to for using it to encrypt / decrypt messages and its value is priceless.<br /><br />Libertas

				Someone should challenge the reports facts about this being a turf war between sites.&nbsp; It&#039;s speculation no?&nbsp; <br />Seem to make assumptions or just read these forums for rumors.&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually they refer to facts over at that government owned news source.&nbsp; &nbsp;Taxes pay for that news, the people there deserve better for their money. <br />&nbsp;

				To the OP, just use PGP and make the orders separately. I don&#039;t know what happens if you click &#039;Place order&#039; with numerous different vendors at once but at best it will lead to confusion. And always use PGP.

				I just order separately every time as I do not know what would happen if I put them together and do not want to trouble vendors with having to copy and paste the right pgp for them.. Takes an extra 2 minutes tops..<br /><br />Also: WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU NOT USE PGP?? Took me all of 5 minutes to learn it and I&#039;m not exceptionally computer literate..

				you can encrypt your message with multiple public keys. less confusing to do it separately i think.<br />but it works and you can do it.
