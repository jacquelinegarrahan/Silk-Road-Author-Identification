				Last time around I had the same amount and I was lucky enough to run into a great dude Account33, whom had Xanax 2mg bars for 2 going for around $7 bucks and shipping was just about .07 which equally made my day as it was the only amount I had left. To top it off it made it to me in TWO DAYS!<br /><br /><br />He currently doesn&#039;t have this offer so I would like to know family, if you could get me some references...I&#039;m also open into trying something new. (No weed, as I hate marijuana - just gets me all paranoid)<br /><br />I am open to some of those blotters but there seem to be so many damn different kinds now. The only ones I&#039;ve tried was 2C-E and it absolutely blew my mind. I think I had too much and it effected me long term as IMO it mad me have anxiety as in before I tried 2c-e I had absolutely no anxiety.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D Thanks for the time

I have been around the forums a lot before I do any purchases and such. I think the forums are a real life saver. You can even tell if the posters of a user are scammers making false statements for a thread review jsut by reading their past posts.<br /><br />Thanks tho brother
