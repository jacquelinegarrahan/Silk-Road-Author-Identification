That&#039;s exactly how it was; one day fine, the next day busted. No warning. I don&#039;t even thing the farmer market indictments have been resolved yet. <br /><br />The people who thought SR (the site itself) was invincible drank too much Kool-Aid.<br /><br />Everyone keeps saying the forums will go down. As long as they are maintained, why would they? Nothing illegal happens here (well at least it shouldn&#039;t). The errors seem to be traffic related. As the dust settles and people clam down, the forums are running much better.

				It most likely will go down eventually, probably not because of LE but when no one pays the bills or maintains it and it decays into death.

				In about 50-100 years when the war on drugs is well and truly over, some one will dig up these forums and look back at how we all struggled just to feel better, just to heal ourselves and how we fought and won this silly war till the end, some Terminator 2 shit right here.

I have no idea what that site is all about, but it&#039;s not worth digging through to figure it out. My guess from what he&#039;s written is that he&#039;s accusing Libertas of either sabotaging or not implementing DPR&#039;s &quot;backup plan.&quot; &lt;yawn&gt;
