				What are some good ways to stash large quantities of drugs?<br /><br />A friend of mine regularly keeps 5000+ ecstasy pills, as well as multiple ounces of coke hidden in his house in a secret compartment he has cut into the roof of his bathroom (It just looks like regular part of the roof). I am always telling him there&#039;s no such thing as a completely raid-proof hiding spot and that he needs to find somewhere to stash stuff away from his house. He thinks that because he was raided once and the cops found nothing, and also because of the ingenuity of his hiding place, that he is safe.<br /><br />I thought i&#039;d ask you guys for your ideas on clever hiding places, and whether you think my friend is an idiot for hiding so much stuff at his house.

				It depends...<br /><br />Do the police have any reason to raid him? <br /><br />If so, which I believe he does because the police have raided him before, then the answer is - yes.<br /><br />Yes, he is probably an idiot.<br /><br />As far as a hiding place goes, find spare garages that are for rental and find someone who is ok with you using it anonymously and stash it in there. <br /><br />Dig a hole in the woods and save the gps co-ordinates somewhere. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really know, can&#039;t think of much.<br />

				Not sure how much he hides, but my friends puts his substances inside a big ziplock bag and hides it in his fish tank lol. Not a bad idea at all, imo,

				Anywhere with a potential volume, that is harder / less intuitive to search:<br /><br />Inside spire tires in your garage, in a hollowed-out tree stump in the back yard. Anywhere matter could fit, that people won&#039;t think or try to search. Down a really deep hole, that can only be retrieved with a magnet and a string.

				I would be careful using any well known diversion safes such as the outlet, pop can, candles ect.<br /><br />Law enforcement is well onto that.<br /><br />Clearnet<br />http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/april-2012/focus-on-searches<br />Clearnet<br /><br /><br />If diversion safes are your route I would suggest watching youtube videos on how to make one and making one out of something custom.&nbsp; By custom I mean something that is not sold online.&nbsp; If you google around for diversion safes you can see most sites sell the same 50-100.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d say the best place varies by living place.&nbsp; I&#039;d always bury anything you wont need for a while in the woods/wilderness.&nbsp; Things that need to be accessed more often in a diversion safe/hidden compartment in house.&nbsp; Depending on the property it may be best to just keep things stashed in a hidden area near the house but this always runs the risk of surveillance.&nbsp;

				I feel like the problem is that they can have dogs and none of these small safes will really be able to keep a dog from smelling it.&nbsp; I realize the dogs can be unreliable though, and maybe something submerged (like someone mentioned earlier) or too high up for the dog to smell would work well though.<br /><br />Then again police are probably used to a lot of these tricks.&nbsp; I might check out something like what EddieTheGun has for sale though.&nbsp; You guys know if they usually bring in K9&#039;s when doing drug raids?

I suppose in an apartment that you really don&#039;t have the option of hiding anything in a sealed container you can haul out of a septic tank? <br />How about a water heater? (Fish tanks are not that uncommon a site, I think; water heaters might be common too.)<br />The spot behind a dishwasher is common enough that I wouldn&#039;t use it, and it is -very- easily scented by a dog. I have rented innumerable apartments/houses now where I have pulled out the dishwasher and found the old baggies of weed / empty booze bottles / porn stash / etc.&nbsp; There are other appliance spots, etc., that are less obvious. I think it depends on how repair-minded you are. <br /><br />A sealed glass jar is scent-resistant, and you can get really small sealed glass (or metal) containers. <br />A Pelican case is also handy, and they make foam-lined ones that will hold your glass jars and that are weather-resistant/easily stashed in weather-exposed locations.<br />You&#039;ll see the K9 officers using these for training and also scenthound people for practice scents.<br />Moisture barrier bags (sorry to keep beating that idea to death) are worth a look-see. Can&#039;t say yet just how long I&#039;d rely on one to keep something away from a pup.<br />Make sure your hands are -clean- when putting things away, and, by clean, I mean &quot;think sterile&quot; and &quot;gloves&quot; and things like that.<br /><br />Dogs are unreliable ... although not as unreliable as their handlers, with false alerts, etc. <br /><br />Stay safe,<br />d.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great post. +1 ;)

				First thing you want and this is important go to a walmart and buy a food vacuum sealer it sucks all the air out and seals it,cos you dont want to get you pills wet,they dissolve,and nobody likes licking the floor before a night out cos your E&#039;s are wet and it fell apart on you droped it/them,then just find a nice quiet place no need to over think it when you over think things that dont need to much thinking about thats when your going to mess up especially looking around for people watching,just make sure its well sealed find a quiet place and stash it,probably a good idea to bag the pills into seperate baggies first though because they you dont want to be carrying that many around.<br />Ta Ta :)

				If you go for hiding it outdoors, and if confident that you are not under surveillance, consider splitting your stash in two locations, for reasons obvious like if your spot is compromised and found, you won&#039;t loose it all..<br />Hiding contraband in large amounts inside your house\apartment is a bad idea.
