				I don&#039;t often express my opinion here on the forums, but I&#039;ve had enough time to stew on this one and no one else seems to be saying it, so here goes:<br /><br />If you take someone&#039;s invention, tweak one little thing, and then go around telling everyone that you are &quot;better&quot;, you get zero respect from me.<br /><br />Litecoin is not innovative, it is not interesting, and in its current form it has no place on Silk Road.&nbsp; Unless I&#039;m missing something, it is exactly like Bitcoin in every way except that it&#039;s mining algo favors different hardware and blocks are created more quickly.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; For our purposes it offers no advantage over Bitcoin and has the disadvantage that it is harder to acquire.&nbsp; It also presents yet another attack surface that has to be maintained and monitored.<br /><br />If I&#039;m missing something here, please enlighten me.

Ideally every bitcoin client should double up as a lightweight miner or something. Realistically today if you are doing bitcoin mining and you don&#039;t have ASIC or better mining equipment then you&#039;re not in the game. One problem is that there is only three or four ASIC producers, which makes a bottleneck the government could control in theory. Having one dominant mining pool probably would be a bad idea as well, although I&#039;m less clear on what effects that would practically have so long as they were profit oriented, higher transaction fees? In any case any centralization leads to the chances of a malicious actor like the FBI taking over becoming higher, that much is certain.<br /><br />More generally scrypt and bcrypt are for cryptographic hashes, they can be used to make generating a hash very expensive which in turn makes brute force attacks on cryptosystems more expensive. Such things are of pivotal importance in deterring nation state adversaries such as the NSA from cracking codes. They have large amounts of resources, but not infinite ones.<br /><br />I know it seems like a minor tweak to the bitcoin concept, but nearly all technical innovations are evolutionary in this way, or to put it another way, everybody is a copycat if you look closely enough. Bitcoin itself is merely the composite of several different ideas thrown together. What is unique about its creation, is that SN saw the possibility of integrating them, not the ideas themselves, which are quite old. Bitcoin is a collage, not a creation. <br /><br />I am not endorsing Litecoin, because I have not examined it in any serious detail, but I believe the health of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is improved with each new addition of a cryptocurrency. This is partly because of diversity in of itself leads to evolutionary processes, but also that the side effect of diversity is robustness, a malicious actor cannot simply &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;steal &amp; lose&quot; all the bitcoin, because then it&#039;ll be in a glorious arms race of speculation forever, cryptocurrencies with new block chains would spontaneously appearing everywhere.<br /><br />Having said that, I think Ripple is most likely a straight forward scam. It&#039;s proposition looks dubious, I like the idea in the abstract but it&#039;s been ruined by Chaumian founders obtaining vast amounts of ripples from the get go and is centralized. Decentralization and pseduoanonymity are the selling points of BTC, so I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing, I think it may have been around before bitcoin faced the byzantine generals problem and addressed it with its decentralized ledger we now call the block chain.<br /><br />tldr; some of the cryptocurrencies are almost certainly scams, but having many contenders for the cryptoanarchic crown is great.

				Well said Pine, ripple was long ago exposed as a scam.<br /><br />And currently it is theorized that ASIC companies are dumping sums of bitcoin, depressing the value of bitcoin. Of course, Bitcoin suffers boom and bust cycles facilitated by those more monied than the average silk roader already, but do we need to be held at the mercy of our own corporations? <br /><br />Litecoin, although silly in nature, will not be subject to local, litecoin based, litecoin producing companies (outside of pools, which I wouldn&#039;t actually call companies) will never hold significant sway over the litecoin economy. No sir! Some multi millionaire&#039;s son that wants to daytrade in the kiddie pool will be the ruler of the Litecoin roost. Never an ASIC company.

				For transactions on SR BTC is good and no need for more options, ltc, etc. Keeps to single currency and smaller attack surface as DPR say etc.<br /><br />Merits posted above are all fair correct and Ripple is scam. BTC has problems, but to checkout on a e-com site only 1 currency needed, if you want to use other just convert before deposit.<br /><br />

				I just feel like we&#039;re going to need a backup currency soon. The US government has its eye on Bitcoin, and if they want it gone, it&#039;s gonna happen sooner than later. Maybe just in the US, but that is probably the overwhelming majority of SR&#039;s clients I&#039;d assume. If they can&#039;t find a way to regulate it under their means, say byebye.

				An article from Forbes:<br /><br />Many users of the crypto-currency Bitcoin see it as the first fully anonymous and untraceable currency. It’s not. But with the addition of a clever piece of code called Zerocoin, it could still fulfill that dream of truly private payments.<br /><br />Zerocoin, the work of a group of cryptographers at John Hopkins University who plan to present their system at next month’s IEEE Security and Privacy conference in San Francisco, offers an extension to Bitcoin that would make the task of identifying Bitcoin users or tracing their transactions nearly impossible. If adopted by enough of the Bitcoin network, Zerocoin’s inventors believe it could become a fundamental upgrade to Bitcoin’s code, integrating itself into the currency and solving what many see as serious privacy flaws in Bitcoin’s current implementation.<br /><br />“A lot of people have tried to make systems of anonymous digital cash over the years, and they’ve failed. Bitcoin has almost made it, but it’s come just a little short,” says Matthew Green, the computer science professor who designed Zerocoin along with graduate students Ian Miers and Christina Garman. “How do we get it that last ten percent of the way? It’s taken us nearly two years to come up with the answer, and this is what we’ve got.”<br /><br />To understand Zerocoin’s significance, consider Bitcoin’s strange properties as both one of the most private and most public payment systems ever invented; Bitcoin is private because it doesn’t need to be issued or stored by banks, and can be spent on the Internet with cash-like advantages, such as never requiring the user to reveal his or her name or register an account. But Bitcoin is also public, in that every transaction is documented by everyone who uses Bitcoin and can be traced to the user’s digital address, part of the function of the currency that prevents fraudulent transactions.<br /><br />“You can feel like you’re private using Bitcoin, but there are going to be companies like Google and Facebook and [Google-owned ad firm] DoubleClick looking at the data and pulling personal information out of it. There may be already,” says Green. “It’s not wrong to be paranoid about privacy when it comes to Bitcoin.”<br /><br />Plenty of Bitcoin users seem to believe that the currency offers enough privacy even for illegal activities. It’s accepted by drug sites like Silk Road, as well as criminal hackers and even some who claim to offer Bitcoin-based contract killings. But for a Bitcoin user to prevent transactions from being tied to his or her identity–particularly at the dicey moment when he or she turns Bitcoins back into dollars, yen or euros–requires extra steps such as sending Bitcoins through a “laundry” service that mixes their “dirty” Bitcoins with lots of other users’ coins and issues them random, “clean” ones. Using those laundry services, such as Bitlaundry, Bitmix or Bitcoinlaundry, means trusting the service to sufficiently randomize the coins they’re giving out, and not to track the coins or steal them.<br /><br />Zerocoin is designed to offer the same privacy and untraceability properties as one of those laundry services, but without the need to trust any potentially shady entity; As with Bitcoin, the user would only have to trust the currency system itself.<br /><br />The Johns Hopkins’ team’s system would work by allowing any Bitcoin user to convert a Bitcoin into an anonymous token–a Zerocoin. Zerocoins would theoretically mesh seamlessly with the Bitcoin network, could be traded and spent in the same way as Bitcoins, and could be redeemed for a Bitcoin at any time. But thanks to some mathematical tricks, a Zerocoin would be both unique–it couldn’t be forged or duplicated–and yet also be impossible for an observer to identify as the same Zerocoin between the moment it substituted for a Bitcoin and the moment it was traded back for one. (For the technical details of how that’s possible, see the Johns Hopkins team’s full paper here or embedded below.)<br /><br />The result would be that Bitcoin would essentially have its own, built-in laundry system. “In fact, you can think of Zerocoin like the world’s biggest laundry — one that can handle millions of users, has no trusted party, and can’t be compromised,” Green writes in a blog post explaining Zerocoin posted Thursday. “Once a user converts her bitcoins into zerocoins, it’s very hard to determine where she took them back out. Their funds are mixed up with all of the other users who also created zerocoins. And that’s a pretty powerful guarantee.”<br /><br />Getting Bitcoin users to adopt Zerocoin may not be easy. To have its intended effects, nearly all Bitcoin users would have to add the Zerocoin code, which the Johns Hopkins researchers are releasing next month, to their Bitcoin client software. In the mean time, the system could be adopted incrementally, Green says. But until it’s integrated into the Bitcoin protocol, Zerocoin would require third-party services to act as issuers of its anonymizing tokens, introducing some of the same trust problems that currently exist with laundry services.<br /><br />Zerocoin also takes about 50 times more computational power than Bitcoin, which could cause delays and glitches in the system. But on that front, Green argues that the code only needs to be honed by the Bitcoin community to increase its efficiency.<br /><br />Green is realistic about the difficulty of getting users to trust a new, complex cryptographic system, but believes that adoption of Zerocoin is possible. “It will take time to convince people that these new techniques are safe,” he writes in his blog post. “We hope to be there when it happens.”<br /><br />If Zerocoin is implemented, it could lead to questions about the ethical and societal implications of truly untraceable digital payments. Anarchists and libertarians have long dreamed of perfect payment privacy as a means to avoid taxes, thwart laws and even destroy the government. As I wrote in my book on the cypherpunks and WikiLeaks, This Machine Kills Secrets, the anonymous payment concepts created decades ago by inventor David Chaum led to proposals by “crypto-anarchists” such as Tim May and Jim Bell for systems that would untraceably buy and sell national security secrets or fund political assassinations.<br /><br />Green says that creating the tools for crypto-anarchy isn’t his intention. He tells me that one of his graduate students, Ian Miers, even hesitated for a time to work on the Zerocoin research for fear of its political implications.<br /><br />But ultimately, the current version of Bitcoin has significant privacy problems that Green and his fellow researchers believe need fixing. Without the use of Zerocoin or less trustworthy laundry services, all payments made with Bitcoin are in some sense entirely exposed. “This isn’t about hiding transactions from governments,” says Green. “It’s about the idea that if I buy something at the drug store, that used to be between me and possibly my credit card company. With Bitcoin it’s between me and the whole world.”<br /><br />“Everyone’s going to look at this as trying to facilitate the trade of weapons or drugs,” he adds. “But privacy is important. And people have a right to it.”<br /><br />Read the full Johns Hopkins paper below.<br />

				The only good thing about it is a regular person can still mine it without expensive ASIC miners since you mine on your GPU&#039;s. There is also 4x as much LTC as BTC to be mined. The difficulty has increased from when I started mining to where I am only getting half as much coin as I was before and the value per coin has dropped by about half. It was over 4 bucks a coin for a while. So I kinda dropped it. I doubt it&#039;s that profitable for me anymore because of electricity costs versus getting half the coin at less than 3 bucks a coin. I always sold it and bought BTC with it myself. I don&#039;t see any legitimate use for all these alternate coins, and there are a bunch. <br /><br />If you have a bunch of the right video cards you can mine it like crazy, trade it for BTC, and buy drugs here with it. That&#039;s the only advantage I see lol, and it&#039;s not that bad of one at that.

				Online drug markets complete with board escrow have been around since the 1990s. My older sister used to buy acid off Lord Digital High Fixer in 1993 on MindVox and mail cash to escrow so it wouldn&#039;t be traced back to him, and for insurance. Russians have also run escrow blackmarket crime superstores since ~2001. Nothing here is new, cops couldn&#039;t seize the servers in Russia and Ukraine back then either and these sites operated wide open. The only difference is this site is far less corrupt than anything before it, as normally you would need to be highly vouched and inside crew members always got preferential escrow rates + advertising and just threw you the scraps. <br /><br />Atlantis is using litecoin because that&#039;s the bootstrap for their site. It&#039;s popular, has a lot of miners and easy places to buy/sell so why not open that market. In return, they are helping litecoin since now there will be a lot of trade using it since you can buy drugs directly with LTC. Everybody knows SR held up bitcoin from 2011-2012 during the numerous Goxxed shitstorms that happened, like when Bitcoin price tumbled to be barely worth anything.<br /><br />I remember endless convos on bitcoin-otc how if it wasn&#039;t for SR bitcoin would still be underground and not nearly as widely used. Almost all the early trade during 2011-2012 was 90% SR and the rest pizzas and speculation. <br />

				There is reason for litecoin if it exists. There isn&#039;t if it doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />Since LTC currently has value, there are obviously those who believe it&#039;s small innovations from BTC are enough to ensure it has a future in the crypto-currency world. <br /><br />In the realm of the free market DPR, your argument appears moot. <br /><br />&nbsp;

Will it&#039;s value inflate? Maybe for a small time period until people get the currency switched over or until they figure out how to incorporate more btc or break it down even further<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well that logically makes me think the value will increase, in turn makes a bitcoin go alot further

I usually pay the equivalent of $1 USD in transaction fees to ensure that the transaction goes through within 45 minutes. Otherwise it takes more than an hour.
