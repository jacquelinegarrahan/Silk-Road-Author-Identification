				Hey all-<br /><br />What&#039;s your favorite drug to do besides Cannabis?<br /><br />I consider myself an experienced drug user. You name it, I&#039;ve pretty much tried it. However, my drug of choice has ALWAYS been sweet sweet cannabis, to which I am a daily user.<br /><br />I was wondering: what is your favorite drug to do when cannabis isn&#039;t quite doing the job anymore?<br /><br />Of course it depends on what type of experience you&#039;re looking for: One time mind fuck like LSD, or a constant substance you can use almost daily similar to cannabis.<br /><br />I personally am not a major fan of hash. 1. I like the act of smoking large amounts (don&#039;t smoke cigarettes). 2. It doesn&#039;t seem to get me to another level 3. Doesn&#039;t seem cost effective<br />Now, maybe I just haven&#039;t had really great hash, but I have yet to find something that will &quot;literally&quot; knock me on my ass. I feel like I can smoke a half of some chronic, packed with keif and there&#039;s still a void to be filled.<br /><br />So, what would you recommend for the person that wants a &quot;step up&quot; from cannabis? When being as stoned as possible is just not enough anymore.<br /><br />Personally, if I&#039;m looking for a mind fuck, like I said before i love a solid acid trip (always grab some fluff when I can) <br />Recreationally, I may pop a few Xanax and drink some booze if my Cannabis isn&#039;t doing the job. <br /><br />I should mention that anything opiate based makes me sick, so painkillers aren&#039;t an option *although I&#039;ve had plent of experience with em<br /><br />

				2nd plateau dxm trip can be nice though I haven&#039;t really felt like it lately. I&#039;ll be watching this thread as I&#039;m looking for something else to use where I can just fuck around on my computer a bit for fun. Not a huge fan of weed (I seem to always dose too little or too much and even when I get it right I just don&#039;t like the feeling too much).

				What&#039;s good TurpenT! you just described me exactly, a few years back. Every single detail. lol that&#039;s crazy..<br /><br />Anyways, since you want to try something different, shrooms then mdma should be next. It&#039;s just advice thou, but since SR has very clean mdma and dank shrooms, you&#039;ll be all set (you lucky) Less is more with shrooms and mdma! especially the first trips. It&#039;s beautiful imo like everything will be all good. lol <br /><br />Just don&#039;t do uppers next, like ice or white. In my case, I dabbed into uppers first cuz it was available, and it would&#039;ve been awesome if I had tried shrooms or clean mdma first. Sorry, if that sounded like an old prick, I&#039;m fucking young :)

				If your looking for something that is a bit less harmful to be used more frequently than not, I woul;d suggest K. <br /><br />&nbsp;Mushys, MDMA, LSD all the other good stuff , simply can not be used day to day with out having diminishing effects, not to mention what MDMA and others fun stuff can to do your health.

My favorite is to smoke some DMT while I&#039;m on an acid trip. It was the first time that I can say that I successfully &quot;broke through&quot; and witnessed a feeling and saw colors that just can&#039;t be described (like most DMT trips&nbsp; ;) ) but hey that&#039;s just me. K-hole bound.<br /><br />Let me just clarify that I don&#039;t endorse stacking drugs, especially if you haven&#039;t taken the drug by itself before. In this case I made that mistake with Ketamine, and therefor don&#039;t REALLY know the feeling (although, I&#039;ve got a pretty good feel for it&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Not to mention the fact you could easily die with any of the drug concoctions I&#039;ve mentioned above.<br /><br />Don&#039;t die kids. Please do your research.

				Get yourself some real honey oil, better yet true budder (not the garbage &quot;budderman&quot;) sells.<br /><br />Invest 15 for a propane tank with a pencil flame head, bend a kitchen knife in half so the tip fits snug in flame. Grab a pin and straighten then put a tiny curve on it. Next use a hollowed out bic and sbueal tiny air hole on side with a quick flame to melt hole closed.<br /><br />No matter your tolerance you&#039;ll be floored in 3-5 hoots. 1g usually provides 150-175 hoots.<br /><br />2c-b rocks if u like visuals :)

				Hey man i suggest you try some synthetic cannabis some of the JWH or something like that they are more intense than smoking weed... you could try consuming cannabis in edibles as well for a different type of high than smoking... also 25i-NBOME is pretty enjoyable especially if you like LSD... definitely try some extacy if you havent before... shrooms are great... DMT.

				Hey : )<br /><br />The best way to make weed fun again is to take a break - yes, lame. but true.<br /><br />I can&#039;t really think of anything else that you could do on a regular basis without completely fucking yourself in the head!!<br /><br />Good luck brother

				I could never get sick of Cannabis and I don&#039;t take any drugs these days, don&#039;t even drink, just good old weed, I don&#039;t regret my drug taking days as they enhance the cannabis smoking experience when I think back to old buzz&#039;s when I am stoned. <br /><br />If you know where to look there are some border line mdma experiences to be had from good hash :)<br /><br />Weed and hash is all I will ever need these days, all good, healthy and happy mind equals a healthy and happy body!<br /><br /><br />;)

				LSD and Weed are the two &quot;best&quot; drugs in the world.<br /><br />The weed is the one i always come back to, all the other dope are nasty compared to it. You lose your soul in a breath of time with coke, amphetamine, meth, heroine, alcohol and so on...<br /><br />We have a heart and a soul, lsd and weed never show you the wrong path, you can&#039;t lie<br /><br />Stay in meditation brother,<br /><br />Peace to you all,

				i would have to recommend ketamine! relaxing, euphoric and inebriating at low doses... psychedelic at high doses. good for someone who hasn&#039;t tripped before. mixes incredibly well with mdma. :)

				I&#039;m always a little weary to answer these threads cause it brings to mind the whole &quot;Gateway Theory&quot; crap and exacerbates it. Then I think &quot;Fuck it, I like drugs.&quot;<br /><br />Now, weed is and always will be my number 1. Any place, any time, it&#039;s rarely a terrible idea to get stoned. That being said, sometimes something more is in order. For that, I suggest trying MDMA first (Because it&#039;s amazing). Then LSD and/or Shrooms. Those will get you to a nice, happy, spiritual place that won&#039;t leave any sort of lasting physical or psychological dependency.<br /><br />Personally? I like uppers. It&#039;s a different world entirely from cannabis, one which I love and hate all at the same time. Self control is important here, cause we&#039;re starting to dabble in narcotics, but with the right research and respect for the drug it&#039;s a hell of a time. Cocaine or pharm grade amphetamine is what I would suggest here. Cocaine is especially good because you&#039;ll go broke long before you have a serious addiction (unless you&#039;re sitting on some serious cash or start flipping, that is).

				&nbsp;the magic of the cannabis can disappear. But it comes back. just take a few months off.<br />&nbsp; smoke it only once a week! and maybe smoke some new stains....<br /><br />there is no other stuff on the market like it. and there is no such thing as a step up... <br />You will never substitute it with other stuff. Its unique and wonderful.<br /><br />If you want to get into something else you can take every day i suggest you look into DMT!<br />Its a whole different world. I recommend it because its as healthy as cannabis, low chance of overdose, can be used daily, its not habit forming and it will tech you valuable lessons.<br /><br />other than this a weekly lsd or mushroom habit is quite nice.<br /><br />I read a lot of ppl recommend K. now that is a nice chemical too. But be careful, daily use could leave you with a serious habit and health issues.
