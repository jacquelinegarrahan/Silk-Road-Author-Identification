				With the reward block halving rapidly approaching, most bitcoin speculators are predicting a rise in value. As a vendor do you think now would be a good time to go unhedged? It seems to almost be a given that prices will go up. Then again, there is a possibilty that speculation has already been factored in the current price as the market has had ample time to prepare for the halving.<br /><br />I predict there will be a swing of wild trades immediately before and after the halving and btc will reach $15+. After a few days it will level off again near its current price. Hopefully my unhedged coins are released from escrow near the peak so I can take advantage of the swing. If anyone is planning to order anything this weekend I would buy my coins now just in case.<br /><br />

				I never hedge. You&#039;ll always lose money if the price hasn&#039;t dropped at least 4%. That&#039;s about $0.50 right now. Certainly possible but I&#039;m betting against it. Use auto-withdraw instead and post a bid for at least +1% Last price, to cover the fees. There&#039;s enough fluctuation in the price that it always sells within a few days max.
