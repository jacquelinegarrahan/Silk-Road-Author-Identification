				Hi :). First of all, I&#039;m *NOT* trying to start any kind of seller war. If you prefer to answer me via PM, that&#039;s fine as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m a rather new member around here. I just started receiving my first orders from the SR. So far, some MDMA from FartBomber, which I haven&#039;t tried yet. But I&#039;m tempted to also order some MDMA from juergen2001. I&#039;m curious what&#039;s the quality difference because the price difference is way out there. What I received from FartBomber is quite white and cost 2.82 for 1 gram. juergen&#039;s is 4.43 for 1 gram, which I find to be quite expensive.<br /><br />NeuroticNarcotic also has some white, he or she sells it for 3.19.<br /><br />So the prices are quite varied and I know that MDMA quality % reports are most of the time completely inaccurate.<br /><br />Did any of you tried white MDMA from more sellers? And if so, what are your recommendations? I&#039;m not aware of any &quot;top of sellers&quot; and their review threads are their own, there is nothing in a &quot;common&quot; place, no reviews of more samples of MDMA anywhere.<br /><br />Thank you in advance, people!

				There are a lot of opinions and preferences out there.<br /><br />The color of the final product has virtually no effect on the quality of the MDMA in my experience.&nbsp; The color is a result of how the product was synthesized (not a chemist).&nbsp; My understanding is that the white is achieved if the cook does a wash on the crystals to remove some impurity.<br /><br />Without calling out any vendors...both the best and worst MDMA I&#039;ve purchased on SR have been white/clear.&nbsp; The big disadvantage I see to getting the clear is that once it is crushed to powder form, it&#039;s probably the easiest to cut with just about anything.&nbsp; The brown is a bit more of a challenge I would think (unless there&#039;s a goto I&#039;m unaware of).<br /><br />Bottom line:&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry so much about color on SR.&nbsp; Buy small amounts from different vendors and find out who your favorite is.&nbsp; Everyone is different.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought from at least a dozen vendors and not one of my friends agree on which batch they preferred.&nbsp; Sometimes, the extra money is worth it and sometimes not.&nbsp; ;)

				Thanks for your answer mate ;). Informative &amp; abstract in the same time :D.<br /><br />Anybody else? Take the stand people :D.<br /><br />I&#039;m tempted to order MDMA from more sources and create a review topic. We&#039;ll see if that turns out to be a good idea or not...

				A friend recently received some of the white from fartbomber and says it&#039;s among the best he&#039;s ever had, he&#039;s tried a lot, although not from SR. Waiting on a batch from oldamsterdam which is reputed to be among the best available here. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s listed as white but it all generally looks fairly white by the time it&#039;s powdered for shipping. <br />As smcoop says, the colour means very little but I can vouch for fartbombers current (ordered 2-3 weeks ago?) stock.

				In my opinion there is a lot of reasonable quality MDMA on SR.&nbsp; The difference between vendor A and vendor B is usually going to be something like 70% MDMA HCl vs 80% MDMA HCl, so you&#039;ll obviously need a little bit more of the 70% one than your would need of the 80% one.<br /><br />There are a lot of reports on SR about the subjective experiences of MDMA from Vendor A and Vendor B.&nbsp; However, MDMA HCl is MDMA HCl.&nbsp; Take the same MDMA from vendor A 5 different times and you&#039;re going to get 5 different experiences because your environment and existing mood and things like that play such a huge role in MDMA experiences.&nbsp; To say that MDMA from one vendor is more happy feeling and MDMA from another vendor is more euphoric is bogus UNLESS the MDMA is cut with another active drug.&nbsp; While cutting is very common on the streets and with ecstasy pills, MDMA on SR is generally not cut with other drugs.<br /><br />When I came to SR I only wanted white or nearly white MDMA.&nbsp; Since then I&#039;ve gotten MDMA from rinran, F16, CloudSurfer and dutchaanbod.&nbsp; The stuff from dutchaanbod was the least white but it was at least as good as the others in my subjective opinion.&nbsp; The tan smell and color are indicative of safrole, a key ingredient in the typical synthesis of MDMA.&nbsp; A lot of people in the street are buying stuff that is clear/white but it isn&#039;t MDMA at all: it&#039;s methylone.<br /><br />All of this said, I don&#039;t want MDMA that is dark brown.&nbsp; If it is that dark then the chemist should be ashamed of themselves for not giving it a decent wash.

				I have only received an order from foreverstrung so far for mdma and it was up there with some of the best I have ever had.. It was all clear crystal, no powder so it wasnt cut.. Very very good product and the price is not bad.. some where around 60 bucks I think.. His listings are down at the moment but I expect them to be back up soon..

				I tried Bungee54&#039;s Molly and it was the best I&#039;ve ever had. The price was good too, ~40â‚¬ for a gram including shipping IIRC.<br />The rocks and shards and powder were completely colorless and gray. The roll was amazing. I sold five 170mg capsules to people at a good price (good for me 8)). At first they were wary of the price but they turned out to be satisfied after all and said it was the best roll they&#039;ve ever had. So effectively I got a nice roll, made 20â‚¬ and gave five people access to awesome molly for their first time (the pills here are garbage).
