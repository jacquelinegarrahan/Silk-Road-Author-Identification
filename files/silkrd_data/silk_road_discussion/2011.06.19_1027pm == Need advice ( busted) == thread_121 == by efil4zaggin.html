				Im in major shit and need advice, I had an order for one ounce of weed and a gram of coke originally the seller and i agreed on normal post but because of the canada strike he sent ups, at first i thought this would be ok but when i decided to cancel the same day , then silk road went down , on friday the shipment tracked as in my country ,Ireland -very fast i was expecting a tuesday delivery , i rang ups-ass holes, to give my phone number because they always have trouble finding my house. two hours later i have 4 cop cars and a sniffer dog outside my house with the package they dident even attempt to do a controlled delivery i was in shock and addmitted to it because they knew that i rang earlier on from my mobile. The&nbsp; vendors packaging was sloppy and the coke was not vacuum sealed and it was all shipped in own packaging&nbsp; along with toy cars and dinasaurs and such. im in deep shit and i have 2 more orders on the way to my address i have to cancel them somehow , could anyone advise me what to do im really worried can they do anything over one ounce and a gram , i dont deal<br />thank you<br /><br />

				So the police delivered your package to you?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;m willing to lay money on this being the same guy/troll from earlier trying another incarnation of his lame story again I bet.<br /><br />But in-case I am too quick to judge and you really are worried. They cannot do anything to you for an ounce of green and a gram of coke, just say its personal use and with those amounts its well believable. The most you will get is a fine (if you have no previous offenses). I have a farmer friend who got caught with a house full of green, about 20k in cash and all sorts.. he got let off with a fine and they didn&#039;t even take his house away. You are fine with your 1 ounce of green and a gram of coke.<br /><br />Now the thing is, if this really is true then you need to expose the vendor that sent you the gear in such a shitty way. This is serious and he could be putting others at risk.<br /><br />

				another crazy story of someone being buster. all you gotta do is verify. what is the seller&#039;s name and why is it you have access to the internet?&nbsp; did you make bail or something?<br /><br />if the packages were sent there is nothing you can do but we sure would like to know the seller who would ship in such a dangerous, not to mention STUPID manner... which is why it is hard to believe you in the first place.

				You got it right it was LOWTEK, he seemed like a nice guy but damn ,i got another look at that package today, yeh he did use canada post packaging and not ups box and it was labeled as toys for small kids with no customs declaration or tax ,id say customs wanted to tax the shipment and oppend&nbsp; it. The cops dident even deliver the package nobody did they just first raided my place and then showed me the package, i was asked to go to police station today where they arrested me for possession for supply held and questioned me for&nbsp; hours on camera. Fuckers cornered me into saying that i might have shared with friends ,they told me that even&nbsp; giving a toke to someone is supply. I dont know&nbsp; how to get rid of this supply charge

				if you were busted honestly the seller might have sucked but you bought weed and coke from international and didnt question how it was packaged? you know there are tards out there who are to cheap to buy a vacum sealer. you bought 2 of the worst drugs to make it past sniffer dogs and you didnt question packaging from some dude with no rating. ratings are there for a reason, you know they know how to package properly. no rating means you have to question packaging big time. buyers on this site take alot of risk dont be stupid and not ask questions regarding packaging. its your ass on the the line. gl with the cops and dont narc on the site.

				Hey they released me after questioning, being arrested was just the procedure for the interview and yes i did question the packaging and the seller did vacuum seal the weed so i supposed he did the same for the coke it would have been fine through the normal post&nbsp; but ups without their company packaging is not good, I did not have time to ask anything when he changed the shipping to ups because silk road went down. zifnab stop being an asshole

				I&#039;m not trying to be one. Ok, lets say you&#039;re on the level in which case my apologies. <br />But cops don&#039;t haul you in, question you and let you go without some kind of documentation. <br />I find it funny that with posts like this, when someone asks for proof they get sidelined, spoken over, ignored or called an asshole. <br /><br />efil4zaggin, if you&#039;ve got packages on the way you&#039;re going to get another visit in which case it really depends on what you told the pork in your first interview. Did you use plausible deniability? Even though it was sent to your house was it addressed to your name? I assume it was since you&#039;d have to sign for it. <br />Maybe get out of town when you think they&#039;re arriving so you can say &#039;See, i don&#039;t know anything about &#039;em, i wasn&#039;t even around when they arrived!&#039; .<br /><br />

				zinfnab i am on the level. I dident for ask any documentation and wast given any, I was told that I may be summoned to&nbsp; court In 5 months time. No I did not use plausible denaibility because I rang ups from my mobile on that morning to attach a phone number to the address as i did not think of doing so when i thought it was going to be sent via the standard post . I did not even get delivery of the package and was not asked to sign for it. the cops already had it

				As important as a lawyer, is to always know a good bondsman, and it&#039;s not a bad Idea to go and introduce yourself to him, make sure you have arrangements ahead of time.&nbsp; Sometimes shit happens, and just cuz your not some street thug from the ghetto doesn&#039;t mean that this isn&#039;t considered a serious offense.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The main thing, the *very* main thing, is not to say anything!: be surprised and horrified that someone would even *think* you would engage in anything like this, and be sure to say &quot;*no* you can&#039;t take a look at my computer without a warrant.&quot;<br /><br />Sitting in front of a computer screen seems to lessen the danger to some of us, and that is unfortunate, because we get our guards down...it&#039;s a harsh and terrible lesson, that some of us have to learn.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to see anybody hauled off, but if it happens, you just *have* to hold your mud and practice meditation or something...the desire to talk to the cops, as if by admitting everything they&#039;ll give you slack, is a dangerous delusion.<br /><br />Good luck to anybody who got in trouble over this, and as the man said: get a lawyer!&nbsp; This is no time for asking people on here what to do if you get pinched.

				Hello all I am new to this site and don&#039;t usually post but I saw this thread and thought I could share my experiences with you. <br /><br />I am in the UK an have been busted twice for cultivation. Each time, as is required by UK law, when I was booked in the custody sergeant offered me a solicitor, which I duly accepted. I was advised to say no comment to each question. I ended up with community service each time, no fines, caught red handed on site.<br /><br />As for time in custody I was in and out on bail after 12 hours the first time and then 4 hours the second. It depends how busy they are and how much of a risk they think you are. <br /><br />efil4zaggin I don&#039;t think that you have much to worry about. I had over 4 oz and 11 plants the first time and still did not get charged with intent to supply. For just 1 oz an a gram I can&#039;t see you getting any thing more than a small fine and/or community service especially if its your first offense. <br /><br />If you didn&#039;t take a solicitor, which it seams you didn&#039;t,&nbsp; then you need to get one. No need to get charged with or admit&nbsp; more than they can prove. Also admitting your guilt at the earliest possible opportunity can work in your favor, you may get a reduced sentence.<br /><br />hope everything works out for you.<br />

				Most people are terrified the first time they get in trouble w/law, and justdesperately want to make it go away.&nbsp; It&#039;s just human nature.&nbsp; Sometimes I think we&#039;ve seen too many movies and cop shows, and think we&#039;d act all tough and be stand-up guys, when the reality is much different, and usually a friendly cop gets all the info they want.&nbsp; Why defense lawyers stay busy.<br /><br />By the time you learn to keep quiet--be friendly, chat if you must, but don&#039;t say anything important--you&#039;ve already been thru the mill a few times, and often have a record, sadly.<br /><br />To the OP: don&#039;t be too hard on yourself, you&#039;ve acted pretty much the way most people new to legal problems act, and what&#039;s in your favor is mostly the design of SR itself, which protects dealers from the occasional terrified buyer in custody, and also the simple fact that you are small potatoes, and they probably don&#039;t want to even bother with this.&nbsp; Probably get a slap on the wrist and a cheap lesson out of the whole thing.<br /><br />Its o.k. to change your story: say you were frightened and confused...<br /><br />Cops actually want the bad guys, not some poor bloke getting a little bit of dope...and they know you can&#039;t really give them any info, so my impression of this whole thing is you&#039;ll be alright.

				You said the pkg was shipped without a Customs Declaration.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t see how it could have ever left Canada without a Customs Declaration.&nbsp; It couldn&#039;t possibly have been processed for shipping without it.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only parcel that doesn&#039;t require&nbsp; a declaration is documents.

				The law in the Irish Republic is similar but different to that in the UK.&nbsp; There are no bail bondsmen as bonds / sureties aren&#039;t the massive amounts as in the US. You can be released without bond, simply to return to the Gardai (Irish for &#039;Police&#039;) station at a given time. The bail will be explained to you verbally by the sergeant on release and it is quite believable that you would walk from the station with no paperwork.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been in and out in two hours - depends on how busy they are, the nature of the offence etc.<br /><br />See http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/arrests/ for more info.<br /><br />There was no mention of a solicitor being present at the interview.&nbsp; The Gards can&#039;t lead / pressure an arrested person or trick them at interview - OP should take legal advice (from the FLAC for free or his/her own solicitor) and ask for the copies of the interview tapes.&nbsp; The OP needs to get rid of the &#039;Possession for sale or supply&#039; part of the charge as it has a bigger fine (up to €1270) and the possibility of gaol time.&nbsp; Seems s/he was pressured into that part, needs looking at by a legal advisor.

				How dumb are you? Why did you phone to check on the package using your own mobile? Why did you have it shipped to your HOME address? <br /><br />1. Phoning was a mistake but if you really had to you should have done it from a pay phone or throwaway cell. This would give you the ability to deny you ordered it. <br /><br />2. You admitted it (seriously wtf)<br /><br />3. You talked to the police, you should never do this even if you&#039;re innocent. Tell them you won&#039;t speak until you have talked to your lawyer. <br /><br />Basic rules of life, the cops are not your friends unless you are the victim, and remember they have to PROVE you are guilty, well unless you&#039;re an idiot, use your own phone and then admit to the crime.

				Whyd you ever admit to guilt? That was your very FIRST mistake. All you had to say was &quot;wtf are you doing here do you have a warrant? No, I have no idea who that package is for. I called UPS regarding a different shipment. Get off my property now or come back with a warrant. have a joyful day Mr. officers.&quot; They didnt know shit or they would have never asked. NUMBER 1 RULE of ANY Criminal. NEVER ADMIT TO GUILT. Unless youre looking for a plea bargain. But especially never on initial questioning. Plain stupid &amp; I feel no remorse for you. Just a heads up if any of you are truly worried then have all packages delivered with a fake name. When package arrives put it somewhere in your house, unopened, for at least 36 hours. If any ones going to come they will come within a day. When they arrive simply say you received this package in the mail. It didnt have your name on it &amp; you werent expecting it so you planned to take it into the post office and just havent had the time to get around to it.... Besides that no one should order from the piece who thinks since there is no risk for him he can just conduct business any old way &amp; take no caution. He should, in all honesty, be booted from Silk for his negligence. Hopefully we can all work together to avoid a similar fate for any of us :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				Well anything ive had from the USA&nbsp; by UPS is always taxed to the hilt,Then UPS charge on top for collecting the Tax,its more money for them .so no declaration/value probably upset them ,Reckon irish dude may be lucky with a fine /community work.provided he doesnt implicate himself with&nbsp; international trading net.unfortunatly to many sellers rush into this without thinking about the consequeces of bad delivery.
