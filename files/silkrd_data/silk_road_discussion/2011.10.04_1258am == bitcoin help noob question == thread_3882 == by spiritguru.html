				Hello, I am working with Tradehill and paxum, and am having some difficulty converting money to bitcoins. Do I wire transfer? What exactly is that? Add or withdraw funds? How exactly does that work? I attempted to deposit in tradehill which led me to paxum, and my head is going in circles. Can someone help out and chime in? Much appreciated! The buyer guide was kinda vague on this.

				I feel your frustration.&nbsp; I&#039;m finding it confusing too.&nbsp; Everyone here seems to take to it like a duck to water.&nbsp; I&#039;m going the uKash to bitcoin route.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard of Paxum.

				I think a lot of us have gone thru this: it does take some study and perseverence to use this site: I know sometimes, when you read posts from those of us who&#039;ve been here a while, we can make it seem like we got it easily--and some might--but I had to do a lot of work, a lot of study, just to get tor enabled and to find the damn joint, then I had to learn how btc worked--and went thru just what u are going thru--then I took in pgp ha ha: that&#039;s fun...then I got into using better alternatives than just windows + tor apps...I started using linux with privatix...sometimes tails...<br /><br />You can really learn a lot, doing all this, and again, just plugging away at it--and asking questions, as you did, is how most of us probably got it....the wikipedia articles were very helpful in the beginning, then once I got tor set up, I started asking questions you did...<br /><br />How to get btc...one way: set an account up with dwolla: they take bank transfers and such...then sign up on, say, tradehill: u can then purchase btc with dwolla.&nbsp; All this is legal, no problem...<br /><br />now that u own btc, you want to go thru an ewallet, get an instawallet account...&#039;tumbles&#039; those coins....set up btc wallet on your computer, from there maybe to SR, maybe back to ewallet....lots of choices, depending on paranoia level etc...common sense should rule...<br /><br />best wishes, but don&#039;t get discouraged...part of the fun is learning how to do all this stuff...and there&#039;s really no easy way but trial and error...I can&#039;t tell you all the errors I&#039;ve made, as it would reveal to much of my identity, but from ebay and paypal, to even reformatting and loosing several hundred dollars worth of btc, I&#039;ve made a bunch....

				Do some test runs. Transfer 1 BTC through the whole process before you move your intended amount. It may take a while but it is very much worth the wait. Once you feel comfortable with your method, then make your intended move. Also, don&#039;t ever move more money than you are willing to lose.
