				Or not but listen to my theory.<br /><br />A small number of people (vendors) are working together in a coordinated effort to control MOST aspects (stims opiates physc&#039;s) of the drug market here on SR<br />Obviously they just pulled off a large scale &quot;selective&quot; scam if you will.<br />and starting new vendor accounts starting the long process of scamming our asses again weather it be a big sale or selective new buyer scams<br />I also think these vendors may be affiliated with SR (ie working together making a big no commission sale)<br /><br />I also think these is a small network of people is controlling the feedback left on the silk road vendor accounts and right here in the rumor mill thread. I&#039;ve noticed patterns of speech, spacing, and punctuation. Not to mention those who talk like a product sales spokesman.<br /><br /><br />And even by discrediting this theory, in some long winded shit spewing fest.not only are proving my point. but are waving the flag of who&#039;s side you&#039;re on. I personally would like to call out Pbucket on his spokesman like talk for various vendors.<br /><br />That really is the art of scamming isnt it? Remember to question everything<br /><br />And as to me being sore about being scammed<br />im only out a few btc for a lesson that is priceless as a new buyer and user of this community. never f/e ever for anyone<br /><br /><br /><br />/discuss

				So is the cadre of conspirators you&#039;re talking about the same one that was involved in Kennedy&#039;s assassination, or were they the ones who faked the moon landing?&nbsp; Or was 9/11 their most recent job before the one you speak of?<br /><br />Sorry (well, not really), but I have no idea what selective scamming you&#039;re talking about and your post comes across as paranoid delusions, frankly.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are a few sock puppets, but I doubt it&#039;s anything near the degree you apparently believe it is.

				Quick question to all people who think this is theory is real,&nbsp; why bother trying to buy drugs here if you &quot;think&quot; its a scam?<br />why not just get off your computer and try and cop drugs on the street like a normal person?<br /><br />I&#039;m seriously blow away by peoples sense of self importance, If you think this place is a scam and all the vendors are in cahoots then you should just leave silk road alone, all you do is create drama.

				I think we all know that Mister Dank awards any reviews with &quot;He&#039;s a pig&quot;.<br /><br />What I am expressly interested is that how is Mr Dank so clued in on pig detection? Maybe Dank is a pig himself and THAT is how he knows how to find them? Like the Witch-Hunter General being prosecuted for witchcraft so-to-speak. <br /><br />What makes me laugh about Mister Dank is that he loves to call out people out and shoot out the conspiracy theories but never really brings any tangible truth to the table but then makes over blown statements like this: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20247.msg204934#msg204934<br /><br />Looks to me like you are trying scare mugs off the top guys and make them come to you Dank....what do you think of that conspiracy theory?

				You have to admit that Tony is a smart guy, because he played SR as a collective like a fiddle and didn;t even have to say jump, because people were already jumping to his every whim. All he did was sit back, and let the community do all the work for him pretty much, besides actually sending out the packages. People became way too blinded and did things for his best interest out of respect for their favorite vendor while sacrificing themselves.

				Well I&#039;ve obviously missed something, because I&#039;ve never ordered anything from Tony and therefore ignored all the threads about him.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was aware of his existence, though, because he was apparently a very&nbsp; high-volume seller.<br /><br />So the consensus is that he did a slow and steady bamboozlement of everybody and vanished after the 4/20 sale? What a (temporarily well-monied) douche, if so.&nbsp; I still stand by my assessment of the OP as excessively paranoid, though.

				i&#039;m kinda glad i was broke for the 420 sale.&nbsp; lot of shit seems to have went down.&nbsp; read through a lot of it the last couple days.&nbsp; i have my 5 orders with no issues under my belt.&nbsp; so i won&#039;t be doing any more fe.&nbsp; sad part is, i&#039;ve used 3 vendors for those 5 orders, and tony is the only one that asked me to fe.&nbsp; i don&#039;t want to think he scammed the sale, but, ya never know.&nbsp; if i were him, and was legit, and pulled listings to fill sale orders, i wouldn&#039;t sell here anymore.&nbsp; i mean, personally, i would never scam anyone.&nbsp; never have in all my years with drugs.&nbsp; but,if i announced i was taking a break, and came back to multiple scam threads about me, it would be easy to take the mindset &quot;if i&#039;m gonna be accused of something, and take this much bs, i might as well do it.&quot;<br /><br />as far as the other conspiracy theories floating around...<br />just because you&#039;re paranoid, doesn&#039;t mean there isn&#039;t someone out to get you.&nbsp; this is the drug business.&nbsp; it&#039;s seedy.&nbsp; always has been, and always will be as long as the product we want is illegal. you feel safe waiting from home, behind your computer.&nbsp; nobody is gonna pull a gun and strong arm rob you.&nbsp; all that means is you don&#039;t have to worry about getting shot.&nbsp; ripped off is still a major possibility, especially if you fe.<br /><br />but, that&#039;s just my 2 cents, take it with a grain of salt.

				Actually Dank, in the U.K they are pretty easy to get. It&#039;s basically the equivalent of buying a Humvee over in the states. <br /><br />I&#039;ve even said on another thread (the one where the European guy asks for Team Synaptic to prove themselves) that if the SR admin staff asked me to prove I have access to the stuff I listed on TA I wouldn&#039;t actually mind showing them where it came from. Why would I? If you say can do something you have to show balls. I&#039;d probably even show a couple of the members on here that I trust, but make no mistake Dank that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;d disclose anything to you. Why should I? You are just a hostile little cunt. <br /><br />And lol...out of touch...when you self-proclaimed to have the best hash on SR bar none...just from browsing the listings....no sampling or anything sent to anyone that could actually say that was true with any credibility....and I&#039;m out of touch?

				Methinks some of you do way too much coke<br />The title of this thread is pretty funny, honestly. <br />The truth is you (OP) have no fucking idea of what&#039;s going on, and are simply making random guesses.<br />Not saying what you&#039;re speculating isn&#039;t possible, but it&#039;s just that, pure speculation. So how about keeping it to yourself?
