				Seriously, this guy took like an hour at least out of his day to help me, a stranger, figure out how to get past some issues as a vendor myself, for absolutely nothing in return. <br /><br />I know he already has good rep here but honestly, what a great person to have on SR! I highly recommend purchasing from his vendor account, he knows stuff inside and out and is unbelievably nice!<br /><br />/dickridingrantover

				I couldn&#039;t agree more. If any vendor deserves a thread outside of the general vendor boards, it&#039;s Fred (his vendor name is LuckyLucianno). This guy sells premium quality MDMA for a great price and clearly cares about his customers. And now I see that he went out of his way to help another vendor just for the hell of it. I really can&#039;t recommend this vendor enough.

				As someone on the buying end, I can vouch for his legitimacy. Not only is his service reliable, but his product is TOP NOTCH. I&#039;ve had friends come up to me and say, &quot;this is the kind of roll I&#039;ve been chasing since my first time,&quot; which is quite the statement..<br /><br />I almost don&#039;t want to praise this guy because I want to keep him for myself, but he deserves it.

				I was reading a thread the other day where im pretty sure it was Fred who loaned a guy some bit coins.&nbsp; The guy disappeared for over a month and was getting trashed on the forum.&nbsp; The guy finally showed back up and said he had issues, but was trying to pay the coins back.&nbsp; The Fred gets on and made a post forgiving the loan.&nbsp; I was very impressed!&nbsp; A stranger had scammed him and he forgave it.
