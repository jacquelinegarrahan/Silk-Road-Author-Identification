				It will only get worse the more popular SR gets, the sad thing is people are usually willing to help as well so others take advantage.

				Could anyone spare a bitcoin for an old ex-leper? <br /><br />Seriously though, I&#039;ve done it myself, once... and just because the BIG SALE was on, I had just a few coins left after my major purchases and wanted to get myself a &#039;lil sumpin sumpin on the side.<br />I wouldn&#039;t ask a vendor who&#039;s selling something for like 5BTC to lower it if I was one BTC short... that&#039;s 1/5 of their price, they gotta eat too.<br />I DO think maybe there should be a thread for beggar scammers.&nbsp; How many people lend out one of these small loans and don&#039;t bother to call out the person who borrowed?

				You can&#039;t complete purchase unless you have required amount of coins in your SR account. Of course you can send message to seller and deal outside of escrow.<br /><br />Maybe allow beggars only post in Offtopic section?

				I agree that it is starting to get out of hand. Maybe we could have a dedicated thread for beggers looking for that last 0.1 btc or even better, create a newbie board. <br /><br />I know a newbie board has been proposed before, I have seen very little response from the administration on the subject.&nbsp; I believe a newbie board, which would be the only place a new user could post until they have a certain about of posts and/or time signed in would fix/greatly alleviate many of the issues the forum experiences, including this one. Most beggers/spammers/scammers are newly registered users and implementing a system like this would be a huge deterrent to any kind of foul play. <br /><br />While this won&#039;t solve 100% of the problems I believe this kind of system would put a big dent in my of the problems in the forums.

				We could call it a loan thread or beggar thread or I&#039;m a broke ass bastard that needs to get high thread.<br /><br />That could keep it from clogging up the forums. <br /><br />

				yea this post was mainly a rant. it was getting really, really out of hand a day or two after the sale - and I would bet you that almost all of the people asking for loans were scammers. shit, even a few people admitted they were two, three, even four different usernames under the same account. it&#039;s really cleared up now since everything has died down. but I definitely think a separate forum for smalls loans would be perfect, especially for new legitimate buyers
