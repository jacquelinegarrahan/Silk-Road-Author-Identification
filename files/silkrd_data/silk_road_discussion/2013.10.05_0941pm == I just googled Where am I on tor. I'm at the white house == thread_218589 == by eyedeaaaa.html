				Tor wasn&#039;t working for me and I was checking to see if I was registering somewhere else. I load http://ctrlq.org/maps/where/ and find that I&#039;m in the white house. I have a screen shot and ip chicken info..not that it really matters. What the hell is going on? Someone else check where they are?<br /><br /><br />my where am i location on the clearnet is normal<br /><br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There&#039;s also a case of diminishing returns as Tor becomes more popular. With each user acting as a transport node, the sheer scale of the system means it becomes steadily more difficult for the intelligence community to run enough nodes to be useful for tracking.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The agencies have also tried to use &quot;quantum&quot; cookies to track targets who are using Tor. Some cookies appear to persist after Tor sessions, the presentation notes, and the agencies are investigating if this can be developed into a working tracking system.<br /><br />from the sticky http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=218289.0<br /><br /><br />ok, read some threads. it makes more sense now, not that i feel better. whatever is going on, it&#039;s happening fast. stay safe everyone

				Yes you do, but if you do not reload the forums while javascript is enabled, you are not at risk. you just can not refresh the forums while enabled or it will put you at risk. you can also use no-script and whitelist that google page. <br /><br />This is so strange, my ip is not a washington DC IP, i should be on a russian IP. And i am not located near the whitehouse, directly INSIDE. There is no logical explanation for this besides our traffic is being redirected through an intercepting proxy exit node located in DC controlled by the GOVT. Somebody try closing the forums and getting a new identity and reloading the wear am i, then try opening the forums, browsing then reloading where am i on teh same identity and post results. This may be some type of new exploit that can flag our exit IP and redirect traffic, i dont know really but i know more than most in regards to how the web and tor function after years of web development and penetration testing experience, and this does not make sense. <br /><br />And rommer, the thing is that using the forums should have NO effect on our location. Maybe google is playing a joke and detects a tor IP and shows us at the white house? I mean it is just out of this world. Maybe somebody can go to what is my IP and find some other website that will show your&nbsp; geolocation and see if that is also the whitehouse. I am too busy at the moment but find something besides google to tell you where you are.

				Didn&#039;t do anything for me. Even when i shut down browser altogether and started fresh with scripts on temporary and still nothing.<br /><br />But what I do notice is when starting the Tor browser, it will not load the start page AT ALL but will load any other address. I find that quite strange. <br /><br />But hey, we all know there&#039;s nothing safe about these forums so that&#039;s nothing new but the fact of Tor itself, i&#039;d hate to think they are able to know all users of tor itself. <br /><br />I&#039;d rather be shot. Dirty nosey government fucks!!! (excuse my language but I think it&#039;s justified)<br /><br /><br />Peace out,<br />Evoc

				Brasky is right though, regardless of his assumptions. most people should be using atleast a vpn in a VM with tor as a browser at the very least if not a vpn + ssh tunnel + VM + tor. most would never do this but a lot do, i know if i wasn&#039;t atleast 4 layers deep i would not be posting.&nbsp; But understand, everybody is not some dumb computer illiterate druggy. If you were a vendor you would see how important security is but knowing others personally, their habits are laughable. but that is not my call, security of other users is not anybodies concern but their own. Just because you feel that you are secure with what you do does not mean you are, there is not right and wrong way to be secure, but their are good and bad practices to stay safe but that is it. If you have nothing to hide, why bother. And if you want to help another user great, but to attack them because you are more &quot;secure&quot; than them? who cares, its irrelevant. <br /><br />And the other guy is right, it goes to the white house if it cant parse your location info. 20 years of experience with network security and i did not catch that. good job anonymuser, thank you for shaming me for not realizing that....<br />

				A virtual machine is when you run an operating system within another operating system. Check out VirtualBox. This creates an enclosed space that even if it was compromised by the government it would be contained. While using this enclosed space you should gain access to the internet though either public wifi or stolen wifi. Dont use your own internet connection. A VPN is like a proxy. It lets all your traffic seem as if it is originating in whatever country you like (most vpns let you pick a country). So now you are 2 levels deep. Wifi and a VPN. Dont forget to pay for the VPN with bitcoins and with a new e-mail and also while using tor. Now you connect to tor. You are 3 levels deep in IP security.

It says:&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;Sorry, your query failed or an unexpected response was received.<br />A temporary service outage prevents us from determining if your source IP address is a Tor node.&quot;<br /><br />It still displays the IP address that it detected from your PC though.

They&#039;d probably be a bit more subtle about having access to your machine (you know, so like you&#039;re not actually aware they&#039;re doing it. Just a thought.

The logical explanation is that it&#039;s a piece of shit website that&#039;s fucking with you. IF you have a Russian IP address, then you&#039;re &quot;geolocation&quot; as far as the internet is concerned is Russia. And why would it be the White House instead of the FBI, NSA, DHS, DOJ, DEA, ATF, CIA, etc. headquarters?

First of all, that&#039;s not Google&#039;s site. It&#039;s a site for programmers that features Google code written by someone who is not a Google Employee. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know the exact reason, but Google maps is not able to determine your location with TorBrowser if you go to maps.google.com. That&#039;s the US site, so it shows a map of the US by default; the other site shows you in DC because it&#039;s the capital of the US. If you go directly to Google Maps, it shows a map of the entire US without a specific location because you&#039;re on the US site and it can&#039;t tell where you are. When I go to another browser and go to the Google Maps site, it shows a map of my state. And when I go to the ctrlq site in plain old Firefox, it prompts for permission to share my location, which it doesn&#039;t do in TOR.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn&#039;t reply to so many posts in the same thread, but I want some of whatever the fuck y&#039;all are high on! Sounds like good fucking shit!<br />

				I finally found a use for topix other than the laughs..&nbsp; go to http://www.topix.com/ and on that page it will tell you where it thinks you are and that is where I assume your exit node is.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to turn anything on to do it.<br />

Everyone&#039;s new at some point. Google shit in your free time. Go to check.torproject.org (hit home button) if you want to see what your IP address is or you can go to http://whatismyipaddress.com/ to see it on a map. The IP assigned to you by tor is dynamic rather than static (you&#039;ll find it changes often). Read up on the part about the NSA and tor. <br /><br />LOL and if you show up in DC, then you&#039;re probably assumed to be in the US at some unknown place. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a tor exit node at the White House, but ya never know&nbsp; ;)
