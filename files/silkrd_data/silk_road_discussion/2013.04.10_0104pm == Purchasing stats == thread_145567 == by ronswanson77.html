				I recently had an order canceled &#039;due to my purchasing stats&#039;.&nbsp; These are what are listed on my account page...<br /><br />Total transactions: 27<br />Total spent: $3563.47<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 6 months<br /><br />Is there something wrong with those stats?&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ve never seen other buyers stats so maybe these numbers are too low compared to some other buyers?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any refund or auto-finalize stats which I know is a good thing.&nbsp; Just looking for a bit of feedback I guess.&nbsp; This is the first time I&#039;ve had an order canceled for this reason so I&#039;m a little surprised and confused.

				Your stats look good mate.<br />If I were you I&#039;d be suspicious as to why the vendor cancelled the order when you clearly have good stats.

				Yeah, agreed.&nbsp; You actually spend more per purchase than the average too, I think -- which seems to be 20-80 dollars, as determined by my super (un)scientific study done here on the forums.<br /><br />To be explicit, it&#039;s my opinion the vendor knew he&#039;d lose big time in resolution when it came to it.&nbsp; I see no other reason to claim your stats are unacceptable.

				Did you bully a vendor in the past by using less than 5/5 feedback to get more product or &quot;better&quot; service? A number of veteran buyers are said to be on blacklists because they do this to vendors especially new vendors knowing the impact their feedback will have on their vendor rating. So vendors aren&#039;t just worried about new buyers, they are worried about SR veteran buyers who think they deserve &quot;a certain level of service&quot; just because they are veterans. Basically, they are being dicks to vendors who assume the bulk of the risk.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I introduce myself as not being one of &quot;those&quot; veterans when I order from new or relatively new vendors and always leave a 5/5 as long as I get what I ordered. If I have an issue, I take it up with the vendor and note the issue in feedback commentary. Vendors risk their freedom to bring us the goodies we desire. <br /><br />

				Maybe the vendor was looking for newer buyers to selectively scam? You&#039;re too established to fall for a scam and eat the hit without fighting it.

				LOL. There&#039;s that too. <br /><br />But I think vendors are getting tired of veteran buyers throwing their weight* around and try to avoid them. It&#039;s happened to me once recently and I had to explain that I&#039;m not like that. <br /><br />*they worry about veteran buyers because their feedback weighs more than a newbs feedback. Especially on large orders. Veteran buyers have been bullying and feedback blackmailing vendors knowing how much more damage their 1/5 carries. They start off with, &quot;I&#039;ve been on SR for more than a year and I expect... yadda yadda&quot; So us cool vets have to worry about having our orders cancelled everytime we place and order because some uncool vets think it&#039;s OK to throw their weight around to get free shit or refunds.

				Same thing happened to me - the vendor wanted me to FE because of my &#039;questionable&#039; purchasing stats. I didn&#039;t understand, I&#039;d had one cancellation in my entire history. Funny thing though, when my settings were configured to display $ (dollars) instead of BtC (Bitcoins), the stats showed a 54% cancellation rate, which was clearly wrong. As soon as I switched back to BtC display it was correct again. <br /><br />I msg&#039;d SR support and they didn&#039;t know why this was happening and couldn&#039;t provide a solution. So try displaying in BtC if you&#039;re not already doing so.
