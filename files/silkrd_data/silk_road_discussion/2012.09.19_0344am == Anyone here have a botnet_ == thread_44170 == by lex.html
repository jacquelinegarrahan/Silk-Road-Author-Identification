				I think most of us would appreciate it if you hit i4dollars.com and kept it down for a good few days. I&#039;m in the process of reporting them to Paypal for currency exchange.

				You don&#039;t necessarily need one (though it does make it easier).<br /><br />However, as a public service announcement, if anyone is thinking of DDOSing this spamming asshole, please don&#039;t try it through Tor.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t built to handle those loads and it fucks things up.<br /><br />As it appears to be the same prick as the Mt. Gix I&#039;m halfway tempted to throw some coins their way to try to track the money trail.&nbsp; Find out who&#039;s doing it and dox them with an open offer of some H for the first, second, and third person to knee cap &#039;em.&nbsp; Any city in the world will have some junkie with a baseball bat around the corner.

				Thanks for mentioning that Shannon, you are absolutly right about the Tor DDOS.&nbsp; I was picturing somebody attempting it (Lim offered some meph earlier for bringing the site down) and didn&#039;t want anyone picking up a load tester and trying to run it through Tor.<br /><br />They tracked him down huh? Interesting. Thanks again.
