If you&#039;re logging on to SR to buy drugs, you can&#039;t use entrapment as a defense if you buy from an uncover LEO.

				@mnak - NO<br /><br />Read complaint careful. <br /><br />They insist use bank wire instead of bitcoin (BREAK RULE #1), same way they take down many operation, always use money outside of BTC.<br /><br />They suggest NOT to use USPS and deliver personally. (BREAK RULE #2). If they use USPS they cannot send REAL drug. If mail get lost or opened then real drug would get in hands of other people and cannot do this.

Usually they pose as buyers. That&#039;s not entrapment either though. They&#039;re not looking to bust small time buyers. But if you&#039;re buying kilos of coke, you&#039;re probably NOT buying them for your personal stash. <br /><br />It&#039;s not even close entrapment. They didn&#039;t direct you to SR; they didn&#039;t even direct you to their vendor account.<br /><br />The government (both federal and state) having been doing controlled buys since long before SR even existed. They set up the transaction and usually bust you as soon as the money changes hands.<br /><br />To give you another example, they do stings where they have undercover officers pose as prostitutes. When the john picks up the hooker and money changes hands, they arrest them.<br /><br />It&#039;s not entrapment because the fact that the person was out looking for hookers in a known &quot;red-light district&quot; has nothing to do with LE.

				NOB was the vendor selling the kilos of coke, etc....and was the Federal Agent.<br /><br />Here is his one and only forum post.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17118.msg169915#msg169915<br /><br />When the buyer (who was a vendor,etc) accepted the product from the agents (dressed as usps), he finalized and gave feedback on nobs page.&nbsp; Then when he got busted shortly after when they came back, somehow he gave neg feedback, etc...and it was promptly removed by admins.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing dpr, and nob somehow made dpr believe he was legit, and that his vendor was rogue.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Crazy stuff...

That be big red flag. Then they wan send money via bank wire instead of BTC. Big red flag #2.<br /><br />Safety rules are there for a reason! :(<br /><br />

				Small respectful point:I might be reading wrong, but I think they can&#039;t allow *their own* drugs to be distributed. <br /><br />In the Nod complaint, they in fact did order from the Nod account, knowing that drugs would be shipped via USPS, with efforts to intercept the packages in place. At least that&#039;s how it worked in the attempts that are described in the complaint (no way of knowing if there were other, lost packages.) No journalists have asked them about this, but that&#039;s not surprising, given the lack of media coverage on this case. <br />http://cryptome.org/2013/10/sadler-white-complaint.pdf<br /><br />It&#039;s a subtle difference - I just wouldn&#039;t want people thinking that there&#039;s no way LE could allow drugs to be transmitted via USPS. Because they can, apparently. They just don&#039;t like to ship them that way on their own end.<br />

				It doesn&#039;t matter if he was based in the UK, he had a re-shipper and was selling cocaine domestically in the US.&nbsp; Read the indictment and match up the dates, its crystal clear what happened.<br /><br />For those who are still trying to figure out how it went down,<br /><br />The mod / admin flush was going to accept the drugs in the mail from nob and reship the goods for googs.&nbsp; I know googleyed1 used re-shippers in the US, infact, he messaged me at one point asking if i would be interested in working with/for him.<br /><br />from the maryland indictment page 6<br /><br />&quot;on or about jan 26th Ross Ulbricht communicated with the UC via the internet, and told the UC that the employee had been arrested by law enforcement and that the employee had stolen funds from other Silk Road users.&quot;<br /><br />Flush was last &quot;seen&quot; jan 26th. <br /><br />Remember when a bunch of vendors were locked out of their accounts? Also jan 26th.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=111972.0<br /><br />It was Flush who stole btc and changed some vendors passwords so they couldn&#039;t log on to SR.&nbsp; According to the indictment, DPR then pays nob the 2 payments of 40k for the hit on flush.&nbsp; I really wonder how nob convinced DPR he was legitimate when everyone else was able to see he was LE or a con artist<br /><br />Check out this thread where googleyed1 says that he has cocaine &quot;coming soon&quot; for US domestic.&nbsp; From dates in the indictment and the date of the threads you can clearly tell it was him. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106529.0<br /><br />Googleyed1 later warned other vendors in the round table not to do deals with nob without sharing any details but warning us, &quot;I wouldn&#039;t wish what happed on my worst enemy&quot;.<br /><br />tl:dr&nbsp; googleyed1 ordered cocaine from nob (the feds) and the first &quot;hit&quot; for 80k was 100% on flush.

				lol ok, ok let me clear some things up..<br /><br />the person who got busted.. this was chronic pain, he was an admin of the site and a friend to DPR. Vendors might remember when their accounts got cleared out briefly? that was CP too.. my belief is that he turned informer after this bust.<br /><br />The vendor &#039;nob&#039; was indeed undercover agent, and i knew this, but for some reason DPR tells me to make a purchase from him. So CP offered to be my reshipper and the sting ensued.<br /><br />DPR tried to have him killed because of his stupidity in trusting this guy nob and i suspect CP knew some personal details of him.<br /><br />I left bad feedback on nobs page and DPR cleared it.. nob also said he would kill me (hahahah!!)<br /><br />and i left a message on vendor forums warning people.<br /><br />thats all.

They don&#039;t actually have to send it through USPS to do a CD. When they do CDs, they send a LEO out in a mail truck to deliver your mail (and your neighbors too).

Something else still niggles me, though, and I&#039;m not entirely sure what. I already suspect that one person&#039;s account has been commandeered by someone else and, while I really don&#039;t wish to increase the already absurd levels of recent paranoia here, it does appear that we cannot trust anyone here now to be who they were before the sudden change (including me, I suppose, but then I wasn&#039;t here for long before it either). Perhaps we need JohnTheBaptist in this thread to do some of his style analysis. And actually considering that his presence might ever be helpful is not something I would have dreamed of a week ago :)

				Cp was going to reship it for us to all you lovely people at SR for a cut. DPR had nothing to gain from this deal, he simply had been sweet talked by nob into convincing him nob was a big player. I&#039;m sure DPR saw $$$ in commission at the thought of nob getting off the ground.<br /><br />As we saw, DPR was just a lonely guy who no one really knew, these sorta guys are susceptible to looking for and finding friends on an online environment.

It&#039;s just that, according to the complaint, the mysterious &#039;redandwhite&#039; (&quot;the people [the apparently fictitious] friendlychemist owes money to&quot; who later claimed to have killed FC) was asked over a &quot;chat service&quot; by whoever was DPR in June, &quot;hey, just wanted to find out where you are with the dummy ID idea,&quot; receiving the reply, &quot;I have ran it by my worker and he is working on it.&quot; It was over a month later that a DPR (I don&#039;t know whether the same one) told someone &#039;that he &quot;needed a fake ID&quot; that he intended to use to &quot;rent servers.&quot;&#039; The order of these two conversations being swapped in the complaint feels less than accidental to me and the scenarios I conceive that could have led to the two snippets mostly suggest to my mind that the need for IDs was initially proposed by this &#039;redandwhite&#039;. It&#039;s just a feeling, though, from my attempts to read between the lines. Indeed, as &#039;redandwhite&#039; is so strongly linked to &#039;FriendlyChemist&#039; it may well be that they, and therefore the June &quot;chat service&quot; conversation, are equally fictional. Which would make my entire supposition somewhat moot :)<br /><br />I&#039;m still wondering, though... Why so many IDs all with different names on Mr Ulbricht&#039;s face, especially when the servers were in so many different countries (including the U.S., Romania, Iceland and Latvia).
