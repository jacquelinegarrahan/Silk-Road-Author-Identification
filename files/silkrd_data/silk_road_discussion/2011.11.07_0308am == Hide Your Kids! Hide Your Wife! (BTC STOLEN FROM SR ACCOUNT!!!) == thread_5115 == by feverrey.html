				Tonight I was on my gf&#039;s computer and I pulled up tor on my flashdrive to check if my orders had processed. My jacket was in my friend&#039;s car and that is where I keep the url for SR (inside the lining without.onion on it to make it seem random) so I went to hidden wiki and clicked on SR&#039;s link in the drug section. I saw the post about not logging in through hidden wiki and I noticed that the address in the bar started with aaxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion so I thought that was odd. Being new to the community and knowing the forums have a different address I wasn&#039;t too put off, but I still went and found the correct url in my tormail and then logged in that way and promptly changed my password. Hours later I got home and hit up my new bud SumYunGai for some bitcoins in exchange for my moneypak. He cut me a sweet deal and deposited 27.03 in my account (I had .22 at the time.) I never saw it make it. I suddenly had .25btc instead of .22. I thought that was odd. Check out this screenshot!<br /><br /><br />So at this point I&#039;m freaking out and go to change my password. I can&#039;t. It&#039;s been changed. So I am still logged into my account on the forums but someone else has changed the password after withdrawing all my btc. I have 3 drug orders processing and I know as soon as they go through he will cancel them and take those bitcoins too...<br /><br />What do I do? there is no account listed in the notes for where they went.<br /><br />Am I screwed? Should I be worried about my personal IRL security? Should I just give up SR? I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m out $100-200usd over this. :(<br /><br /><br />Anyone who feels bad enough to donate to my cause. even .01btc makes up for some of the stolen funds.<br /><br />17TcWazgcgqBcppYt5fdt3xiC2a3HeAjxw is my BTC wallet set up for this specifically.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Thanks for the feedback, I have alerted SR, talked to SumYunGai and he has agreed to vouch for me and sent SR a message as well. I have messaged the vendors I have orders with and have asked them to leave them in processing for now till this is sorted.

				Make a new account and ask those sellers in a message not to proceed the order. I assume this prevents the &#039;cancel&#039; option from appearing. Contact SR and see what he can do. Don&#039;t expect fast or actual good results though, because things are hard to prove.<br /><br />Other than that.. chalk it up to a loss, and also, I don&#039;t think your IRL security is compromised. If you encrypted your send address all is good.

				u need to have a file storage joint online somewhere, with the correct address of SR and SR forums....and there I keep my serious convoluted pswds, also...I keep them in a keypassx file, but it&#039;s not necessary...trusting *any* link is just asking for trouble.....trying to keep up with the hidden wiki&#039;s constantly corrupted url for SR is a loosing proposition....<br /><br />I keep mine in one of the online dropbox-like sites, so that even if I am logging in with my portable Tails, at some strange library&#039;s computer, I can make it to wuala/swissdisk/dropbox and get my goods.&nbsp; I have an easy-to-remember-for-me passphrase to get into my online storage site...after that, I&quot;m home free, get my onion urls and my pgp keys...also keep my instawallet spots there too....<br /><br />So all I really need with me is an innocent Tails on a stick....then go to site and get the gear with the correct addys, so no mistakes possible...

You&#039;re dealing with some good vendors here, specially YunGai. Should take the edge off the pain.

				Keep the correct SR url stored in your favourites (if you&#039;re using the TOR aurora browser from a USB) and always keep the USB drive hidden. Its what I do. I could destroy it in seconds if needs be.

				Well I have to go to work here in a minute but I logged in to see if anything positive had happened since last night. Once I logged out of my account last night on SR I no longer have any access to it. I hope my vendors saw my messages and didn&#039;t process the transactions. I&#039;m really disappointed, this is quite a buzz kill. So not only did the hacker get the $100+ in btc that I had in my account last night, but now he has full control of my account with pending orders so I am not only not going to get that $100 in btc escrow back most likely, but I am also not going to get the things I ordered.<br /><br />This turned into a shitty weekend fast. :(<br /><br />

				Also, I started a new SR account so I could message my vendors from there and hopefully talk to whoever runs SR and see if I can get my orders transfered to the new account or whatever.<br /><br />new account name is notamused<br /><br />feel free to message me.

				I think it&#039;s a bad idea to post your SR marketplace handle here if it is different from your SR Forum handle. It proves nothing and alerts any scammers as to what your new handle is so that it can be targeted too.<br /><br />[edited for spelling... damn fingers]
