				hey, first time i&#039;ve ordered from frank and was just wondering if any of his long term customers could clear this up. has frank usually expected orders to be FE, or is that a recent request from him? Just that, though it be slow chrisi mail, our 4# brown has been 11 days in transit to UK, and i&#039;m reading some sus feedback on such siches. i know we can be a paranoid lot, but just that got me wondering. FE always, or recent demand? Ta, Ms Hangin! :o

				It&#039;s my personal policy not to do business with vendors who require FE. <br /><br />It&#039;s the easiest way to get scammed. Vendors don&#039;t risk anything by using the escrow system (yeah, they don&#039;t get immediate payment and their BTC are tied up for a while, so what?) since they will always get paid eventually if they deliver what they promise. However, the buyer risks EVERYTHING by FE. <br /><br />And it has happened time and time again - a vendor starts off not requiring FE, builds up a reputation, starts requiring FE, continues selling for a while without problems, and then, all of a sudden, they disappear with a lot of people&#039;s money.<br /><br />So I&#039;ve decided that the risk of getting scammed and having my money stolen far outweighs the benefit from buying the products these vendors offer.<br /><br />If everyone reasoned the way I do, you can bet that most vendors would stop requiring FE. But people don&#039;t and so they encourage vendors to do so and give them an opportunity on a golden plate to steal their money.

				Mail is statistically unlikely to genuinely get lost in the mail process.<br />Hopefully turn up in due course.

				I bought two cheap (delivery cost) samples from him months ago. <br />First one was LSD without FE and delivery was fast.<br />Second one, 1-2 months later was MDMA with FE and it never arrived.<br />Just my little experience with him.

				Hi, <br />&nbsp;I have ordered from him a few times, he is a really really good vendor. I have had one of his packages not turned up. I was allowed a reship or 1/2 refund. It was only a small order so chose reship and the re-ship arrived! <br />I remember the first few times I FE´d because I was new. After that he didn´t require it but I still did to help him out. I knew if something happened he would still help weather I FE´d or not.. So wasn´t too bothered. <br />Don´t sweat it, in the unlikey event a package does not turn up he will sort it out. Really professional, and OMG his #4 is la creme de la creme. SO good. <br /><br />ACE from The Scurvy Crew<br />
