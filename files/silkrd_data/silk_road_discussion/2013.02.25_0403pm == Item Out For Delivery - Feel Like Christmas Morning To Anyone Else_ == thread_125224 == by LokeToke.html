				LoL My recent orders tracking info just changed to &quot;Item Out For Delivery&quot; meaning its on the Truck out to be delivered to my drop address. Am I the only one that gets that feeling you used to get on Christmas Morning when you were a kid waiting for your parents to wake up LoL?&nbsp; ;) Seconds are starting to feel like hours waiting for the slow mail man LoL..... Trying to kill time so I&#039;m just cruising the forums...<br /><br />-LokeToke

				Gengar&#039;s been good this year, Santa. Get me what I want and please not coal or jail. <br /><br />I get a little stressed out by it too, with btc being on the line and everything. Then again, Christmas stresses me out as well so the analogy stays intact.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				Oh, it totally used to fuck with me in bad ways too.&nbsp; I only order from people with proven stealth these days though.&nbsp; Well... mostly only them.&nbsp; Basically if I think there&#039;s more than a fraction of a percent chance of it getting intercepted, I generally won&#039;t order from somebody.&nbsp; And honestly, after like.. fuck, I don&#039;t even know how many orders.&nbsp; It&#039;s gotta be 30-50 by now, I&#039;m a lot more relaxed about it.

				This is brutal LoL. Never had a Delivery take this long once it&#039;s out for delivery. Said out for delivery 6 &amp; a half hours ago I&#039;ve been waiting here. Just called a random post office asking what time do they make parcel deliveries until and they said until 7:00-7:30pm, 3 hours from now. Before anyone asks no I don&#039;t suspect anything got intercepted, it&#039;s just Monday and Monday is apparently always the most busy because they&#039;re making deliveries that got backed up from the weekend.

				Well the Tracking Info showed as Item Delivered about 1 hour after I posted the above post, which was weird because it wasn&#039;t delivered to the drop address at all with kind of freaked me out a bit. Turns out instead of delivering the tracked item to the drop address door, they put it in the community mailbox on the street where you go to pickup your regular mail. Kind of stopped my heart for a second before I thought to look in there LoL, I actually thought the mailman just left it at the drop addresses door since no signature was required and someone spotted it and stole it.<br /><br />Anyway Christmas Morning is finally here!&nbsp; ;)

Hilarious.... but 100% accurate.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I like to try a few different vendors at first, then stick to just one vendor once I find one who best suits my needs. It takes much of the guesswork out of the equation, since you have an idea about both processing and shipping time, as well as the level of stealth (some vendors just suck at stealth, no matter what the feedback says).<br /><br />Ordering from new vendors is a whole different ballgame. It&#039;s like a box of chocolates, you never know what you&#039;re going to get.

				The period of time between in transit and arrived is the worst.&nbsp; &nbsp; I always think, today is the day,&nbsp; count down the hours until mail runs, then feel like a popped balloon when I get nothing.<br /><br />I want some kind of futuristic mail box, particle transmitter type thing, where someone can stick in my order and it magically reassembles on my end.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe someday.......

				My first order just arrived today, waiting for the mailman to get here turned out to be an exercise in self control giving me all kinds of personal insights along the way lol .By a happy coincidence I didn&#039;t have to work today, so I intended to sleep in but woke up around 7 in the morning waiting for my blue clad santa to arrive!<br /><br />After what felt like 3 days I went to peek inside the mailbox and BEHOLD! There was the product of a month of studying bitcoins, pgp, vendors and lurking around the forums for hours at a time. This is an amazing community with plenty of knowledgeable people and a few idiots here and there to keep things funny on the forums when the need arises.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m feeling the effects of my goodies by now if you couldn&#039;t guess by the content of this post. Thanks SR community and I plan on having plenty more good, safe, anonymous fun here.&nbsp; 8)

				My favorite part is:<br /><br />When you have bills to send out. <br />So you put Up the red flag.<br /><br />Then just look out of the window for the red flag to be Down.<br /><br />Its like a mail alert notifier, so I don&#039;t have to walk out in to the cold.<br /><br />***I was thinking of putting a wireless, motion detector also, like a house alarm, in to the mailbox.<br />As soon as it disconnect the two sensors, it would send a wireless alert.
