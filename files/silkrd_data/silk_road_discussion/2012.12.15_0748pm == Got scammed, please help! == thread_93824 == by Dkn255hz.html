				Hey guys, this might sound a little unusual but I figured I would give it a shot and see if anyone can help.&nbsp; I have been on SR for only about 6 months, and just this last week got scammed for the first time.&nbsp; I was basically trying to buy $500 worth of bitcoins from a vendor called Pills4Less, and I sent the money and he never sent me the coins.&nbsp; He also ripped off about 3 other guys that I know of for what looks like over $2000 total.&nbsp; Anyway, I am not normally the one to ask for charity but between getting scammed by him and buying gifts for my family for Christmas I am pretty much wiped out and don&#039;t foresee that I will be able to buy anymore bitcoins for quite a while.&nbsp; So, I am basically just asking that if this has ever happened to you, or you just have some goodwill in your heart and any spare coins that you can donate to my cause it would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; I know there are many others out there that are much more unfortunate than I am.&nbsp; My promise to you is that when I get back on my feet again that I will donate to others here on the Silk Road that, through no fault of their own, have landed in the same unfortunate situation.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can read about myself and the others that got scammed by this guy Pills4Less here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93334.msg660380<br /><br />Please send any bitcoin help to 121HuXsqLVPGCm2XVRrKBeqfC2uft3AeRM<br /><br />Thank you and Merry Christmas!

				man that really sucks and unfortunately it&#039;s part of the game when you don&#039;t take the right precautions but I don&#039;t think anyone is willing to donate money to support someone elses drug habits. just doesn&#039;t seem right

				This place has really spoiled a lot of drug users. People act like they never got ripped off on the street before. On the occasions you DID get ripped off on the street, how well did you do with asking for a Refund? And if the Refund idea didn&#039;t work on the street, did you turn to Pan-handling afterwards like you are on here?<br /><br />L<br />O<br />L<br /><br />

				I am really sorry to hear that you got scammed man.&nbsp; That sucks.&nbsp; You should notify SR support through your SR account and let them know about this so that they can shut down the vendor&#039;s account.&nbsp; You should also make sure to write about this in the scammer thread.<br /><br />Next time you need BTC be sure to use one of the vendors with an excellent forum reputation like CaptainMal, SugarMama, BTCMaster or Chronic Crew. Don&#039;t fall for the vendors offering zero fees or vendors who haven&#039;t been thoroughly vetted by the community.

				People need to stop using anyone on SR except for the FEW trusted vendors that have NEVER done wrong. Sorry for the new vendor trying to get started.. <br /><br />USE THE VENDORS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED AND BEEN HERE OVER 6MO WITH PERFECT FEEDBACK AND YOU WILL NOT GET SCAMMED.<br /><br />I feel bad for OP...but if you have use 1 of the 5 that are the best on here...you would never get screwed.

				Everyone should ALWAYS prepare for the worst on the silkroad. It is the black market and that fact should not be taken lightly. I would imagine most of us have gotten scammed at least once even with the precautions put in place. Sorry buddy I doubt anyone is going to give you much in the way of charity. The only advice I can give is to always stay in escrow.
