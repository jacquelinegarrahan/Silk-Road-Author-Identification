				Here&#039;s a question for the community. I&#039;ve been here for over 3 months now as a buyer and I&#039;ve always played it straight - I hate all scammers. Does anyone here think that it&#039;s a good (or at least not a bad) idea to change account names every once in a while just to keep too many transactions from being tied to you? Or is that unnecessary, especially since I&#039;d hate to lose the good stats I&#039;ve built up along the way?<br /><br />Thanks all!

				I am also interested in switching names for security purposes and would like to keep my stats. Let&#039;s hope we get some great responses ;-)

				Logging on as a buyer and given a new random number for every transaction/session would be good.<br />If the buyer wants to id themselves to the vendor they have done previous business with, that is up to them.<br /><br />I dont want to see a the name of the buyer. I want to see a random number with previous feedback history left by random number including the vendor they purchased off.<br /><br />Sure if that random number buys from me several times I am going to assume it is the same entity going on the feedback they left previously.

That is more optimal.<br /><br />Obviously Silk Road needs to ID individual buyers, so they will have to have a big list of all your random number aliases.<br /><br />But yeah, internalizing the source of the feedback means LEO has to crack the Silk Road&#039;s server before they can work out how much feedback any particular buyer has left.<br /><br />What&#039;s more of a concern to me, is that the more feedback left for sellers, the more focus LEO will bring to bear on them. I think that the full number of feedbacks should be used in the calculation of their rating/ranking, but that only the last 100 feedback or so be used in verifying they are legit. That way you can lose all the other feedback/evidence while maintaining the results. Problem is, scammers might take advantage of such a plan by toodling along for a few months to make it appear they&#039;ve been here forever and then suddenly sell 100 items so it looks like they are super legit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I like the idea, but not really seeing how it would make easier to spot a scamming vendor?<br /><br />Definitely makes scammer buyers easy to spot tho.

				Oh those wacky scammers. If they only used their nefarious powers for good instead of evil. No matter how seemingly foolproof a plan is someone will crack it, so you can only do your best and patch any cracks as they appear. I like the random number idea as long as it&#039;s always changing. But for a vendor to see that the same number is a repeat customer means that the number isn&#039;t really random. In that scenario a number is no better than a name. <br /><br />My original thought was not so much about stopping scammers - a worthy goal in itself - but to protect people from possible LE scrutiny as we pile up multiple transactions over time; buyers as well as vendors, of course. The more I think about it though there really may be no practical way to keep things random but still connect whatever identifying system there may be to a particular buyer&#039;s or vendor&#039;s history, feedback, etc. But I&#039;m not a computer wiz so maybe someone else could figure it out.<br /><br />Of course, you can always ask how necessary doing any of this actually is, considering Tor, PGP and all the other anonymizing strategies we work with (and we all sure do hope they work, don&#039;t we?).
