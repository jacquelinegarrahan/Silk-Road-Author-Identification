				Interested to hear from Vendors about their perspective on the current market on SR&nbsp; Has it changed ? Have other vendors migrated over to other sites ?

				I only use SR and only will use this site unless it goes down permanently and have to use somewhere else..<br /><br />The only change&nbsp; have noticed is when the site started running again after the last down time (week or so i think) orders were very quiet for 1-2 weeks, then after this orders picked up again and exceeded previous buying rates imo, which proves good to me!

				I don&#039;t know if its me but l have seen an increase or newbie vendors Interestingly for me the Irish Vendor&#039;s seem to have stayed on and seem to be staying the course&nbsp; ;) Does anyone think that we will see a continued increase in vendors and is the future of selling For me personally its safer l always say that a closed markets better than an open market (open market is street buying) closed is buying from the same supplier that can have some quality assurance

				It seems to me that the rate at which new members are joining in general has increased.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I can&#039;t tell whether that&#039;s accurate, or just crotchetiness on my part. I don&#039;t follow the news very well, so maybe SR has gotten some publicity that has attracted members<br /><br />Although vending used to require a fee and now it requires a&nbsp; bond.&nbsp; So it&#039;s essentially free, as long as you can afford to float the $500 for a little while.&nbsp; That might encourage new vendors. ??<br /><br />With regard to weed specifically, I think that de jure legalization in CO and WA and de facto legalization in CA and OR are encouraging new vendors.
