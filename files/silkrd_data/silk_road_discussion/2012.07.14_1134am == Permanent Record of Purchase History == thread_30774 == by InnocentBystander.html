				Is anyone else bothered that SR is storing a complete record of buyer&#039;s purchase histories? You can clearly see that this is happening by going to &#039;Account&#039; &gt; &#039;Feedback&#039; where there is a list of everything you&#039;ve purchased since opening your account. I imagine that by now there would be some accounts tied to hundreds of illicit purchases.<br /><br />If the DB was ever compromised this is potentially highly incriminating data and it just seems completely unnecessary to store it longer than a month or so. The feedback itself doesn&#039;t need to expire, just be disassociated from the account that left it. <br /><br />Obviously this is not a risk unless an account could be tied to an individual, but it would be a pretty major fail-safe if SR could put some limits on the amount of purchase history that it stores.

				Fuck that,&nbsp; buyer stats, stops the kiddie new buyers doing 20 ebook transactions at 0.03 btc each. I think it should be one buyer, one feedback instead of per item. And they should have a vendor recommended flag on buyers, or vendor feedback on the transaction. I&#039;m pissed off cos new buyers and scammers are pushing the prices up and everyones going into stealth mode so u cant find what u want.

				I think they have plans implemented for such attacks. My main concern is people getting busted while on SR. Recently as some of you might know a customs officer was arrested for meth, and while being charged he divulged that he used SR, and handed over the account to the police. I`m guessing more charges were added after their discovery of his transactions through his accounts.

				Yeah it was that guy recently from NZ I thought that was hilarious. He didn&#039;t just willingly give them the information they found it and he didn&#039;t deny it.<br /><br />A lot of good points in this thread. I like the practice of a new account, bitcoin deposits in another zip code and every so often new account and new zip code to deposit bitoins.<br /><br />The problem I have is the need of 10 or 15+ transactions to not have to finalize or for some sort of refund security. That&#039;s the only issue for me.<br /><br />If I could get away with it I&#039;d make a new account for each purchase and make every incident as isolated as possible. That&#039;s my security, the problem of course is while that is ideal for me as a consumer, the vendor is constantly at higher risk for fraud. There must be a balance of security and I feel we aren&#039;t too far from it. If you have more than 15 purchases what if you have a good relationship with a vendor and he becomes informed by you that you transferred to a new account and accepts it and applies warranties based on this history.<br /><br />Imagine making 100g+ orders and having to have 10 orders which seems to be common on here before you get more refund security would suck.

				I don&#039;t see how it would matter if LE got into the SR database, unless you have been PM&#039;ing your name and address unencrypted. Otherwise, as long as you purchased your Bitcoins anonymously, how could they possibly connect your account with you in real life? But then again, what do I know.

The point is that there is clearly a large proportion of the SR community that don&#039;t fit in to this category. Currently these people are highly exposed should LE gain access to the DB. <br /><br />If a limited transaction history was implemented there would be a 2nd layer of obfuscation (non-dependent on user compliance) that would provide a significant degree of protection to ALL sr users.<br /><br />I just want to make it very clear that adding this feature does not imply any other changes to the site behavior. Vendors could still get the same summary data showing total number of purchases, total $ spent, membership length, etc. Feedback could also remain exactly as it is now. The ONLY change it implies is that a purchaser would only be able to see/edit their most recent transactions/feedback. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t personally advocated &#039;switching accounts frequently&#039; because I don&#039;t think it is an adequate solution. I also agree it could be somewhat negative to the SR community. However I can totally understand why some are considering this. If you yourself were in the not-fully-compliant category and had a few hundred purchases tied to your account, wouldn&#039;t you be a little worried?

				I think it&#039;s a dangerous game to play &quot;they could never link me&quot;, &quot;it&#039;s not necessary That&quot;, etc. I hate the feedback. I think it should be there but I think it should be coded in a way so that products and prices are not seen. maybe just a ticketed number. Serial killers thought there was no way they could ever get caught, then DNA evidence came out. All of a sudden these supposed articulate mass serial killers looked pretty damn sloppy and get charged. <br /><br />This is an &#039;arms race&#039;, we have to keep evolving to stay ahead and it&#039;s kind of stupid to sit around and say &#039;don&#039;t worry about it, there can never be a link&#039;, because it suggest that we are contempt, it suggest that we are not thinking ahead, and it suggest that we as humans are perfect. Security measures are absolutely perfect, and there is not reason to worry, because we know for a fact no links or proof will or could ever be found. Why use PGP when the site is already encrypted? Why use it when we know the SR will never go down? Very very dangerous ways of thinking. <br /><br />The game is ever changing, this is an ARMS RACE do not get contempt and no human is perfect. A link now, a link in a year, a link in 5, a link because humans aren&#039;t perfect. If only just to say there is more security with it just not being in existence, which is fact, is all worth it to me.&nbsp; No buyer likes these stats, none except the fool.<br />

				I was originally less sketched out by SR when I knew that finalizing your order would remove its traces.&nbsp; Never really thought about (or figured out til after the first couple orders) your ratings always being there.&nbsp; I would really love to see some updates to remove that personal information after a few weeks.&nbsp; Keep the review, great, but honestly it&#039;s a bitch to think that someone could go in and see everything I&#039;ve bought.&nbsp; <br /><br />Showing the amount of cash spent isn&#039;t as big of a deal, you could say it was all BTC or legal purchases, who could possibly contest that reasonably in court unless they can show reviews listed?

				Feedback remains in the database indefinitely. It may not be diplayed on certain pages after 3 months, but it definitely is still in the Database. As is your the entire purchase history linking you to everyone of your transactions since day dot.<br /><br />Please tell me I&#039;m wrong DPR?

				A Short List of Hypothetical Reasons Why a User May Not Use PGP<br /><br />* A Vendor posted in SR Discussion around 2 days ago that his cipher/plain ratio was 50/50 (Attempt1: Not found)<br />* Compliance is 100% optional .<br />* Compliance should negatively correlate with confidence in SR&#039;s ability to securely store sensitive data<br />* Compliance will depend on how well user understands the risk reduction<br />* It relies totally upon user compliance <br />* User compliance varies greatly depending on the specifics of the compliance scenario (US seat belt: 49% 1990)&nbsp; <br />* Avoidance - People tend to avoid doing things they don&#039;t like doing. (Do you like to GPG?)<br />* Avoidance - People tend to avoid doing things they do not have to do.<br />* Ignorance - Why would I bother with that<br />* When running late, humans will generally not prioritize optional talks <br />* Never learned how to operate GPG (for whatever reason)<br />* Previous Failure- &#039;I tried doing it that way before and it didn&#039;t work&#039;<br />* First Purchase - &#039;Nah you don&#039;t need that shit man, that&#039;s why it says optional.&#039;<br />* First purchase - &#039;GPG is for serious shit, I&#039;m just buying couple of benzoes&#039;<br />* First purchase - &#039;should I just click buy now or go and learn about all that GPG stuff? &#039;<br />* First purchase - &#039;Skip the GPG, that&#039;s just if you&#039;re paranoid&#039;<br />* Frustration - &#039;Fuck this I&#039;ll just send it plain.&#039;<br />* First purchase - &#039;You don&#039;t need TOR SR and GPG that&#039;s too much encryption&#039;<br />* First purchase - &#039;you don&#039;t need GPG because it&#039;s only going through the SR Server.&#039;<br /><br />You&#039;re almost encouraging people to not use PGP It was up to me I&#039;d lock it down immediately.

If you&#039;re not happy with what SR has to offer, then get out of here and moan to people who will put up with you. This community doesn&#039;t spoon feed everyone who comes through and nobody spoon fed me - when I wasn&#039;t sure what PGP was, I googled it like anybody else with some sense would on the basis it increase our personal security.<br /><br />You remind me of my old school teacher. He was a cunt.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />StExo FFS I&#039;d been banging my head against a brick wall for a long time before that frustrated/paranoid post came out. This thread is about a design flaw not about me. Unnecessarily keeping 8+ MONTHS OF POTENTIALLY INCRIMINATING DATA IS A FUCKING BAD IDEA. If I have to jump around like a dick, get called a cunt or whatever else&nbsp; to get SR to realize this, so be it.<br /><br />While SR has been particularly hopeless at deleting anything, let&#039;s say they are not persisting shipping records. That still leaves the fact that BTC addresses are permanently tied to the account and therefore a single unsafe BTC transaction is able to full connect an individual to their entire purchasing history.<br /><br />I think the user compliance issues are, for some people, obscuring what are major DESIGN FLAWS and OVERSIGHTS. Ones that have always been there but are becoming more and more apparent with the growth of the site. <br /><br />Also, not just aimed at you Steno, I really don&#039;t like this attitude that ignorance deserves to be punished. I&#039;m not talking about the people who have never bothered to learn GPG or recklessly continue to acquire BTC without anonymity. It is about those who&#039;ve done it ONCE (perhaps a handful max), likely when they just started on SR, and didn&#039;t think it would be a big deal (FFS who would have assumed that SR would keep our transaction logs for so long). These people have likely contributed much to SR and I believe SR should be trying to protect them with every resource they have (ahem site-makeover ahem). <br /><br />SR definitely isn&#039;t responsible for Little Johnny using non-anon btc, but SR sure as hell didn&#039;t tell little Johnny that his records would be stored permanently and that single non-anon btc could have a severe impact on his liberty. <br /><br />Although I do regret much of my post you referred to, would it really be such a big deal to postfix the&nbsp; &quot;Enter your address&quot; message with &quot;Although optional it is highly recommended that all personally identifiable information be encrypted&quot;? Possibly a few other similar suggestions in critical places? <br /><br />The buyers guide does a good job of keeping things as simple as possible for a beginner to make a purchase,&nbsp; but skips over&nbsp; (likely by design) the critical security steps required for fulll anonymity.<br /><br />[speculation]<br />To me this is all tying together in that there seems to have always been the assumption that accounts would only be tied to purchases/deposits/etc. for a very short amount of time. Early mistakes would be inevitable but unimportant as they would likely involves small quantities and would be wiped after a month or so. As the user gained experience they&#039;d hopefully become more security aware and better able to protect themselves.<br /><br />Somehow this didn&#039;t happen. The early mistakes are hanging around (along with everything else) and creating potential for identification of accounts that may me tied to hundreds (soon thousands?) of purchases.<br />[/speculation]<br /><br />P.S. I was specifically linking to your succinct and comprehensive implementation proposal from a few pages back, when I was messaging SR and the admins yesterday. We&#039;ve obviously got a similar agenda so could we please hold of on the infighting right now?&nbsp; I&#039;ve got nothing against you, and fully apologies for all offense.

				Even if LE found &quot;transactions&quot; on your account its still very hard for them to bust you because that isnt &quot;proof beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that you did infact recieve drugs. Maybe your just circulating coins with a vendor to leave positive feedback on their page...and in return they send you the btc you gave them as cash in the mail plus some profit added for the service. See what im getting at? If they dont have you in posession of the drugs or intercept the drugs coming to you then it makes it very difficult for them to stick charges just based on account stats.

				The scenario I think is very possible:<br /><br />LE busts a SR vendor not by intercepting a package, but due to someone they deal to in real life (you know they must also do this) giving them up, or maybe a supplier (they all have them), or someone else they know hands them to LE for a plea. They bust in with a no-knock warrant and catch the vendor in the middle of filling orders. The vendor has packages addressed and ready to go. He/she is still logged into SR. DEA takes over. They get all the info they can from past sales, including any addresses they can find. They send word to postal inspectors to flag all mail going to these addresses. They let enough stuff get through to you (cause you&#039;re still ordering from other vendors, right?) until it&#039;s worth it to bust you. You&#039;re caught unawares when they bust down your door, so you&#039;ve got some product still in the house. If any of these poor busted people are ALSO vendors, just repeat! <br /><br />Just sayin&#039;! I don&#039;t think LE should ever be underestimated in their abilities or willingness to pursue crimes.
