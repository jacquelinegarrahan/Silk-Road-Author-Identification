				These spams (both Viagra and Bitcoin related) are the work of the &#039;Mtgix spammer&#039; who has posted under many different aliases on the forum which can be seen here &#039;A Warning for New Members About Bitcoin Scams&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108836.0 I have been spammed by xingjau, jjbosst, and&nbsp; reakton. There isn&#039;t a&nbsp; feature on the marketplace presently where a user can be ignored (I wish this feature would be implemented to help remedy this). The only action that can be taken is to delete the spam messages straight away if you&#039;re familiar with the username being related to the spammer, and report the username to SR Support so the culprit usernames can be banned. Every new spammer related username I receive will be reported to SR Support and if I don&#039;t see it mentioned on the forum I&#039;ll add it here.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Captch might not work for very long as I think they probably have an easier time overcoming that than regular buyers. Banning new accounts will only work if they dont have a bunch of unused accounts in reserve.<br /><br />A right click &gt; Report username&nbsp; or some other way to report them might be able to lead to automated account suspensions when over 10+/- reports come in during a short time period.&nbsp; Suspensions could be rebutted by suspended users who request review of their suspension. Not an easy solution, I know, just throwing it out there.

				the newcaptcha is working for me too in the PM with my customers. It seems to have cut down on the spam now, so thanks for that. It is a needed barrier if people are going to start doing that. It&#039;s also a testament that SR is big enough to have it&#039;s own eco/weather system..lol. like whale with little parasite fishies nibbling on it&#039;s skin

				I mentioned this in another thread, but this one seems to be getting more traffic, so I&#039;ll mention it here too.<br /><br />Why not make new and low stats accounts deposit BTC before they can send messages? I understand the need to allow buyers to contact vendors before a purchase, but really if they are serious about making a purchase, they should have BTC on hand to deposit into their accounts. Make it a minimum of 1 BTC before messages can be sent. For accounts with less than 10 transactions and $500 in purchases, there would be a 3 day delay on withdrawals, so the spammer can&#039;t deposit BTC, spam a whole bunch, and immediately withdraw the BTC. It would give admins the time to identify the spam accounts and delete them, keeping the BTC of course, and making the spamming not worth it.<br /><br />Accounts with more than 10 transactions and $500 would not have to deposit BTC to send messages and could withdraw immediately.<br /><br />None of this would apply to vendor accounts of course.<br /><br />Also, even when they deposit BTC, why not limit them to 10 messages a day or something?

				Yer the 3 message per day is plenty enough for a simple TX problem, it would maybe even create a certain mindset in place to think before you have questions/complaint/whatever.<br /><br />If it was included in the Buyers Agreement, and the reason why time messaging constraints have been implemented,.<br /><br />which would maybe fine tune some stuff at the other end of the spectrum with admin having to deal with less info maybe.<br /><br />I have always wished for a better vending mail system, one of my favorite hang ups is the ability to delete ALL, no option to simply select some you might need for a later date, maybe for disputes, or maybe for quick reference to your own sent messages/ or even using it as a listing warehouse :). <br /><br />Which at some point or another i usually end up saying to meself, I should of had the brains to have saved that .<br /><br />Would be great to have your own mail folder/link to go to.<br /><br />with that being said i hate mess and can live with the mail issues i have, even this recent spate of vendor email abuse was easy enough to navigate through. <br /><br />
