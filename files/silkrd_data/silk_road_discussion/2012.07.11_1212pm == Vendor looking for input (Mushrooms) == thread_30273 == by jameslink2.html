				I have had a rash of people (4 out of 30) complaining that the mushroom pills I am selling are no good and I am looking for comments from the users as to what you think.<br /><br />Note: The pills are fine, I have tried them and BenJesuit even reviewed them here --&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26494.msg295933#msg295933<br /><br />In each case the person took 1 or 2 pills (0.5g to 1g) and expected to trip. This IMO is a VERY low dosage and I would never suggest taking less than 4 pills (2g) and preferably 6 to 8 (3g to 4g) for a good trip.<br /><br />Is it common for users on SR to take such small dosages and expect to trip?<br /><br />What is your experience with mushrooms in general? <br />How much would you suggest as a minimum dosage?<br /><br />Maybe I should update the listing to explain what a minimum dosage of mushrooms is or state how many pills they should take?<br /><br />I am open to suggestions and comments.<br />

				Hey there James, I would definetly say 1g in pills is too low for cubes.&nbsp; You might get a body load and slight color enhancment but nothing to wow over.&nbsp; Yea, let them know they&#039;re taking too little.&nbsp; 2 grams would be my minimum recommendation.&nbsp; Good luck man.

				I think you should outline that in your sellers page. Did you at least say how much was in each pill? You have to do things like this if you don&#039;t want bad reviews. A lot of the buyers on SR are inexperienced which is most likely why they were expecting to trip from one pill. Its sad they couldn&#039;t take the time to look up recommended dosages...=/ You should try contacting them to change the reviews. If you clearly outline the dosages on your seller page then you should expect to get less bad reviews, although you can&#039;t stop the assholes. If they refuse to change the review refuse to do business with them, those aren&#039;t the kind of customers you want anyway. ;)

Cubensis<br />mushroom contains between 4-8mg of Psilocyben. This means that 1g of mushroom<br />may produce a minimum effect provided you weight under 143lbs however the<br />average American will need 2g to get a noticeable effect.<br /><br />Although some users eat just one gram of &quot;shrooms,&quot; dried weight, I find this<br />produces little more than threshold effects. Two grams should produce a mild<br />psychedelic high, three grams is the suggested dosage and will provide full<br />visuals, and five grams should produce an experience of similar intensity to a<br />250 mcg. LSD trip.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am wondering if I need to dumb it down? (This statement is not intended to offend anyone, I can get overly technical at times.)<br /><br />As to changing there reviews, Ill leave that between the customer and my self but I agree I have a list.<br />

				I feel like that second paragraph makes it pretty clear. If your customers aren&#039;t getting it it&#039;s likely that they just didn&#039;t read it. Maybe condense it into bullet points?
