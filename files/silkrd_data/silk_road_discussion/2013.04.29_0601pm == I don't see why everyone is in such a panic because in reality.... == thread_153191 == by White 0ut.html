				In real life, for someone without Silk Road, it&#039;s basically just like your weedman (drug dealer) went on vacation, and your bank is closed for a weekend Holiday.<br /><br />Yeah, it really fucking sucks, but unless your weedman get&#039;s killed (shut down completely) then he&#039;s going to be back soon, &amp; probably with more goodies!<br /><br />&amp; well, coincidentally the weedman owns the bank as well in this case! :D<br /><br />Just trying to stay optimistic in these times we are having, but seriously, when SR starts going full 24-48 hours of being offline completely, then I will worry. <br /><br />Until then we have DPR&#039;s updates to look forward to!<br /><br />Stay up!<br />

If we were satisfied with flaky dealers and lazy bankers, we would not be here hitting refresh button every few minutes trying to be one of the lucky ones who gets to shop or vend. I am still optimistic all this hardship will make us even stronger and it&#039;s all gonna be good (or at least pretty good) soon :-)

				+1&nbsp; Good outlook, exactly how I see it.&nbsp; When street buying, today was like one of those days where you go through all your contact numbers but none of them can meet you that day or are all out of product so you just gotta get over it and wait for things to change.&nbsp; It happens.&nbsp; At the moment I&#039;m only out of weed because I smoked a lot over the weekend but it&#039;s no big deal, I&#039;ll just have more beers instead.&nbsp; Could go score bud or hash off contacts if I wanted it badly but tbh I don&#039;t feel like making the drive back and forth and I have faith that probably already by tomorrow if not Wednesday some orders I&#039;ve made will be shipped out.<br /><br />I think SR deals are worth the wait also, because of the convenience of getting it delivered.&nbsp; Unless you have a good local dealer in your town (I live in a kind of remote place) that convenience is awesome because of how much time you can save not having to travel a few miles yourself.&nbsp; So thanks DPR and everyone else involved for making this revolutionary service a reality!&nbsp; In the current downtime I shall continue to chillax with beers, pills and acid.

				I remember probably over a year ago back, when SR was down for a few days, and that was some scary shit. But i think the best thing to do is be optimistic.&nbsp; We got DPR and the rest of the SR staff on our side so we will get through this shit and come out stronger in the end.&nbsp;
