				I do not know if I would call Killerglass&#039;es submission a trip report, but it is certainly an amazing story really well written - I truly enjoyed reading it and was able not only to get to the end (a mean feat for me at the best of times) but to also re-read parts of it. Truly enjoyable!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166774.msg1186886#msg1186886<br /><br />Your submission thread, AnimusVox, is promising to be my favourite on this forum!<br /><br />Needless to say that +1 goes to both!

				Yes, I must admit that that story is very well written and it goes right to the hearth of the reader. Probably it&#039;s the sort of report that is the most direct for what it concerns a contest as this.<br /><br />My personal report is much more technical. It is more meant to help some people that use DMT or other psychedelics on understanding that there are ways to use these substances in certain modus operandi that are not too much known (sadly the occult scene is still a little too much &quot;secret&quot; for many users, or they think that because they research in these things they are dabbling with the &quot;devil&quot; or similar idiocies).<br /><br />I think that, while very good for the first times etc., you just use about only 5%-10% of the real power of those substances if you just use them &quot;to see what it happens&quot; (so to speak) or let the case decide the tide of the experience.<br /><br />I&#039;m personally not much concerned about the contest in itself (even in the very difficult case I would win the prize I would lend it to someone else or to the creator of the contest) but much more on letting people know about these procedures so that maybe they will get interested in them and start researching and experimenting in these things. I&#039;m sure they will not regret this. I also put my personal report as a thank to MultiExciter&#039;s DMT, that I personally find one the better in the EU.

				@tedrux:<br /><br />The contest is prolonged till 14th July because of not too many reports. AnimusVox decided to postpone the final date of admission because many of the people that said they were going to send their reports did not show, so in this way he gave them more time to do so.<br /><br />Please, however, in the future don&#039;t post any not-relevant messages on the submission thread - that&#039;s ONLY for reports. If you have questions or want to debate about yours or other reports or just have some chit-chat etc. use this thread or the original one where the contest was announced. Just for this please remove your message from the submission thread so that AnimusVox doesn&#039;t have to ask a moderator to do so, thanks.<br /><br />As for your report, I personally liked it, and I&#039;m happy you didn&#039;t use cyanide instead, just because it would have been difficult to receive your report then. This could prove problematic since you would have then become an angry ghost infesting SR forums - and especially the submission thread - for all eternity because you didn&#039;t fulfill your desire to post the report and win the prize ;)

				AnimusVox said nothing else so I suppose it will end on the 14th July at this point.<br /><br />We will see I suppose.<br /><br />Reports are still not that many and most of those that subscribed didn&#039;t really participate, but probably this is a thing to be expected. Many people say: &quot;oh great I&#039;m in&quot; but then forget or don&#039;t have the time or simply don&#039;t care anymore.
