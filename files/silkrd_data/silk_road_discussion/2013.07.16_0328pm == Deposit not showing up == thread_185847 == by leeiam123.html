				Same, I was hoping to get my order placed before noon est... I had 6 cinfirmations at 11:15 and now it&#039;s 12, got 11 confirmations and no coins in account yet. Always takes a few minutes after it hits 6, but this seems very long

				Thanks for starting this thread folks. I am having the same issue, and this is certainly not my first time depositing (more like 10th time), so I know to wait at least a couple of hours, or like you guys mentioned about 6+ confirmations before becoming suspicious, but it has been 3 hours and 11+ confirmations, and still no coins, which is making me anxious. <br /><br />I also wanted to place an order before noon, but now I just pray to God that the coins even show up. <br /><br />My guess is that the SR BTC tumbler / cleaner is taking longer than usual to randomize the coins, but who knows at this point. Good luck to all of us who are in the same boat, sure as hell glad I&#039;m not alone though, haha.

				Hi, I know SR tumbles the coins around a bit which can delay deposit. I waited 48hrs+ once, and a couple of times it&#039;s taken 24hrs+, but always has come through :) You can message support, who were able to help me with this issue, but I&#039;d wait the 24 first, AB.
