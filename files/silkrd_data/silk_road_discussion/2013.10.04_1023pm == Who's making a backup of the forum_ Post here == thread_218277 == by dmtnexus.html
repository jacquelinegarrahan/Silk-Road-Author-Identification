				We shouldn&#039;t really encourage more people to put the strain on the server. Remember yesterday, errors popping up all the time? Those error pages will make their way into our backups should the same thing happen again. I will publish mine once it&#039;s done, which by my calculations will be in about 9 days.<br /><br />Edit: I&#039;m making my backup whilst logged in, so the vendor roundtable will be included.

				But whenever somebody manages to get a decent recursive crawl of the forums together, posting a copy on Freenet is the way to go. <br /><br />Before somebody posts the archive somewhere redistributable, they should make sure:<br /><br />1. That they weren&#039;t logged in when they grabbed it (so their username isn&#039;t at the head of every HTML file).&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t be an issue with wget.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. It might not be a bad idea to do a &#039;touch&#039; on each file to get rid of the specific timestamps of each HTML download in the archive before compressing and archiving it. I think something like &#039;find ./my_archive -exec touch {} \;&#039; should do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />3. And a &#039;chown -R root ./my_archive&#039; wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea either, just to strip UIDs of file owners if you&#039;re tar&#039;ing it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I manually grabbed the threads from Security that I didn&#039;t want to lose, but would love the whole archive.<br />

				I also started started downloading the complete forum excluding the user profile pages yesterday.<br /><br />As i rented a server for downloading the forum, i will probably set up an hidden service on this server&nbsp; with the cleaned up forum backup running on it.
