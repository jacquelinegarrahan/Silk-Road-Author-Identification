				Hello SR,<br /><br />I thought it would be an interesting idea to see how we all rank ourselves as users and the results between us. I wanted to keep drug specifics out as this isn&#039;t about what you take - but how SR has impacted your use.<br /><br />I know for me personally, I have been thinking about this quite a bit recently, and have found myself moving up a category or two since finding the road. Definitely broadened my availability which is something i have taken advantage of, experimenting with new drugs that were unavailable to me before. If the Silk Road had not existed, I probably would have tried these new things IF they became available - the main difference is the regular available supply, which in turn has moved me up a spot.<br /><br />I realize the categories are a little vague, as say a &#039;Daily User&#039; could be quite different from someone using weed to someone using a hard substance daily, so I tried to separate them a little while keeping it simple.<br /><br />This is not a thread to brag about your personal use or disrespect others for how they use. Keep it clean and encourage discussion based on if and how your drug use has changed since finding the Silk Road.

				So, by your criteria, am I to understand that methamphetamine and amphetamine users would be classified as &quot;hard users?&quot;&nbsp; Despite your attempt to leave specific chemicals out of this?&nbsp; And that frequent use of same would be &quot;frequent hard users?&quot;<br /><br />I have but one question: what&#039;s up with the discrimination, you bigot?!&nbsp; There&#039;s no category for me.&nbsp; What do you have against us poor, functioning, daily hard users, HUH?&nbsp; &nbsp;:P <br /><br />To be serious though, I&#039;m quite curious about those 2 &quot;don&#039;t take drugs&quot; votes.&nbsp; Just people fucking around, or is there actually more than one random guy who uses this forum and doesn&#039;t do drugs...?<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;d say my user status fluctuates depending on where I am &quot;in life,&quot; y&#039;know?

I don&#039;t fucks with anything you snort or shoot (bad nasal passages already, and just not into any stuff you shoot), but I&#039;ll try anything once if I *know* it won&#039;t kill me. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=113363.msg772112#msg772112">Quote from: SelfSovereignty on January 29, 2013, 01:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To be serious though, I&#039;m quite curious about those 2 &quot;don&#039;t take drugs&quot; votes.&nbsp; Just people fucking around, or is there actually more than one random guy who uses this forum and doesn&#039;t do drugs...?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />an interesting phenomenon to be sure, but I knew a dude back in my uni days who sold coke and H, and never touched either substance.

Prison? I&#039;d much rather been in the rooms. In fact,&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to quite a few both AA and NA meetings and I can definitely see the legitimacy of how they could help some people. Not everyone is the same...personally, they make me want to use more (and when you&#039;re quitting, that&#039;s not good).<br /><br />In response to the OP, I&#039;m a little confused, as to the &quot;daily user&quot; &quot;hard user&quot; and &quot;frequent hard user&quot; categories...I definitely use every day. Oxycodone(or hydrocodone) all day every day, and weed most nights. What exactly would this make me? If daily user is say cannabis or pills, then I&#039;d probably fall into that category, but for some reason, I view daily as just once or twice a day/night. Whereas, I see hard user, not exactly as meth, coke, heroin (the &quot;hard&quot; drugs, lol) but as someone who uses all day, every day.<br />Anyway....voting on hard user simply by my own logic and how often I use...<br />Feel free to clarify and correct my assumptions...

				I don&#039;t really like being labeled something but I do use what ever drugs I want when ever I want, I&#039;m not addicted to anything though. I guess it just depends on your perception of what makes a drug &quot;hard&quot; but if I had to be labeled something it would probably be more along the lines of &quot;highly functioning addict&quot;.
