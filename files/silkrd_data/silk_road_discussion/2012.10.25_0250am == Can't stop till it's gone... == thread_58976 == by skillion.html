				I was into crack for a very short period of time and not heavy into it like every day, but went on binges for a brief period. Used to get 10 $20 bags from the projects and do bong hits with a screen in a glass bowl and cigarette ashes on top till all 10 bags were gone.<br /><br />Am i the only nut who used to do bong hits of crack ? now that I think back it seems crazy to me. But even seeing it on the road I don&#039;t get the urge to procure any more of it these days.<br /><br />I may have unknowingly decreased the potency of each hit&nbsp; by smoking it through a water bong actually.<br /><br />but still, doing huge bong rips of crack is both crazy and dangerous.

				If there is a drug that I can function on at work or around people who I do not want to know I am on something, I will do it until it&#039;s gone. Pretty much limited to opiates now though. Weed effects me a lot different then it did when I used to smoke it all day every day, now I couldn&#039;t do that even if I wanted to, I would get nothing done.
