				It means the server is too taxed and had to bail on your request for the page, basically.&nbsp; As in it tried to service everything that was asked for at that point in time, but it had to give up on some because it just didn&#039;t have enough memory to hold all the requests at once.<br /><br />That&#039;s the basic problem, even if the reality is a little more complicated :)

				Odds are the site will be down again for a min, unless its something they can fix with the traffic. But I dont know, I&#039;m not that tech savy. Just keep in mind that if you do come on tomorrow or when ever and the site is down dont freak out and start throwing all those crazy conspiracy theories. Not saying anyone of you here has done it, its just a common occurrence every time the site goes down. But yes I&#039;m sure a lot of us are getting the same error every now and then and Ive notice today and especially more so tonight the site is running extremely slow as well. I dont get it, cant they just buy a bigger server? How does that all work anyways? In simple minded terms please. Lol

And if one of those connections is slow, your going to be slow? So in order for SR to be as fast as say an average clearnet computer browser, all the servers that make up the TOR network would all have to be top notch as well?&nbsp; If this is correct than you sir did a wonderful job at explaining things for this major burnout/stoner.

I, really just don&#039;t know why it&#039;s so common for people to explain things in ways that basically only people who already understand the problem can really follow.&nbsp; I think a lot of it is that being able to teach is really a skill in itself that most people don&#039;t seem very good at.&nbsp; I think the rest is just people who want recognition for being smart, so they... ya know... try to sound smart.&nbsp; Which is cool and all, everybody wants to be recognized for their achievements, but it sure doesn&#039;t help if you&#039;re explaining something.<br /><br />Happy to help.&nbsp; I like teaching, believe it or not :)

				I wanted to add a few thoughts.&nbsp; Because this is SR, they cannot just go down the the AT&amp;T data center and put in the biggest server or cluster of servers<br />on a gigabit link to the backbone and run TOR.&nbsp; I imagine this has to be run, obviously on TOR, but either in some way with other hidden servers on shared space or<br />through maybe residential connections?&nbsp; I don&#039;t really know and am just speculating, but it seems they would want to jump through many hoops to hide it<br />regardless of TOR, and that may also contribute to the issues they see.&nbsp; <br /><br />

And on top of that, they act like the site has never had downtime before and by spewing all these dumb conspiracy theories they just cause more people anxiety. The best thing to do if the site is down is something else. Ride a bike, watch some tv, call your grandma; I&#039;m sure she&#039;d love to hear from you.
