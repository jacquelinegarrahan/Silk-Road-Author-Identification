				Alright. I personally have nothing against guns, but I don&#039;t believe they belong here at this current point in time. We are getting unwanted attention. The public used to view us as useless (Yet harmless) drug addicts. Now we&#039;ll be viewed as terrorists, regardless of how you use the guns you buy. That&#039;s just how it is, as of right now guns are more taboo than sex with children. <br /><br />EDIT: It really shows your true colors that you would go so far to create new accounts just to vote for guns on SR. You think nobody notices, but in the matter of 15 minutes it just went from 85:15 to 60:40. You aren&#039;t sly.

				I think this is not the right question. We should start from the beginning - how much of us wants this place to represent some philosophical/ideological/social idea vs. how much of us wants it to be another convenience store (yeah, unusual, but still, just another one). And from there you can start ask whether we should ban this or that or nothing whatsoever.

				A few questions to those who are pro gun for SR.<br /><br />What are your motives? Are you looking to purchase fire arms? Are you vending fire arms? Is it just because you believe SR should rebel against the government in every way?<br /><br />Even though you are the minority, do you think its right to undo everything SR has accomplished thus far? Why can&#039;t you guys make your own site?

Hell, I cant even buy crossbow or hunt with traditional bow. To make matters worse, I cant even go outside designated shooting range with airgun.<br />I want to shoot, I have done that in the past and it is just... interesting? For lack of better word. <br />I want my own, personal handgun at home, for situations when some lowlife scumbag will decide that my flat looks promising enough to try it for target. And police is last thing I want to trust to my or any other life for that matter.<br />I want to go to forest and do target practice. I want to feel that power in my hand and I want to learn to harness it and use it responsibly and only when needed.<br />I want to hunt so I kill meat I eat, I have long given up buying meat.<br />Is that valid enough reasons for wanting an option to buy a gun? <br /><br />But here is fun part - to this poll, I voted against guns. And the reason is in my previous post - we are doing it wrong. We are trying to shape something, we actually have not even defined to begin with. If we are all about convenience store (and it REALLY looks that way, hence my vote) - I&#039;d like to keep this one in realm of drugs and money services. If we are about possibly game changing phenomena in our current society, then I am all in for guns.<br /><br />But vote all you want, this question will be addressed again and again, and again if we do not start from beginning. What is this place for us, but honestly. Maybe we should make poll, with answers like a) dealer subsitute b) way to feel more cool c) anarchoparadise d) implementation of long cherished philosophical dream and so on. Then we will see, what it is all about.

If you live inside of the USA and are trying to buy a gun you&#039;re obviously doing something wrong. As long as you&#039;re not insane, or a convicted felon, you can easily apply for a license and get a gun. <br />Now if you live outside of the USA, sorry, but you can&#039;t drag the entire silk road down with you. If you really can&#039;t live without a firearm, then find one in the streets. It&#039;s not that hard.<br />

				Put guns in a separate marketplace on another URL, we&#039;d all be happy then. Facile ideological arguments aside, there&#039;s no real reason not to. If there&#039;s a real market for weapons, then the fees generated from their sales would sustain this second market.

It would have been better if you said something along the lines of... democracy disenfranchises the minority. And that is democracies greatest failure. We are here because we have been disenfranchised by the majority. They made certain drugs illegal&nbsp; because they offend their sensibilities. And that is what this poll is trying to accomplish - the disenfranchisement of a minority. Odd isn&#039;t it? So much for do as unto others as you would have done unto you.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, this last sentence which is quoted is with brimming with merit. <br /><br />There really is no point to this poll. So the majority doesn&#039;t want guns out of fear of it hastening the demise of SR or because they simply don&#039;t like guns (or both). Really, so what? What are they going to do when this poll and its sentiment falls on deaf ears? Leave SR? No, they have no where else to go and the owners or SR know that. And if the owners of SR are reasonably secure that SR can withstand an attack by LE, they are right to totally ignore the fear of a majority SR citizenry. <br /><br />1. The fear is just that, fear and it is unsubstantiated and based on hypothetical events.<br />2. Those who have a sensibility against guns must be ignored as we don&#039;t want to get into the slippery slope of catering to the sensibilities of anyone lest we find ourselves having to go without one of our favorite drug(s) of choice. <br /><br />That last point, #2, has to be considered since this is the very thing that brought us all together. Society&#039;s collective sensibilities against drugs necessitated this place. We don&#039;t want to fall back into doing the same thing society at large has done to us.<br /><br />

				@Happyroller<br /><br />That&#039;s a common misconception it seems. SR owners were never against anything being sold here. Read the sellers page. They asked that certain things not be sold here so as to not draw undue attention of LEO. <br /><br />Now it seems the owners of SR are more confident in their security. <br /><br />And BTW, this is not a democracy.

				You&#039;re right Ben, this is not a democracy which almost makes this entire thread meaningless. There are already a hundred threads on the issue and this poll only makes it clear that more people would rather no guns than the alternative but it&#039;s not up to us. SR has the right to make the call and right now it allows for the sale of firearms. If that changes than so be it. <br /><br />Democracy is essentially just two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.

				I say no guns, just because of the ignorant masses who really buy into the gibberish propaganda and already relate guns and drugs as a connected form of badguyism. I own several guns, both legal and otherwise, While it does seem nice to have an easy place to get a gun, its much easier locally to get an unregistered, class 3, or no serial weapon, for a fraction of the cost. I know this isnt true for European countries,but I honestly dont know many people who can afford 1G for such a weapon, and dont already have access to them.

				Christ almighty. Just a swearword, I&#039;m not a Christian. But the prices on SR are atrocious. If you really need a firearm and you&#039;re in the U.S. just pick up a copy of Shotgun News. Find a friend who has an FFL (Federal Firearms License) and you&#039;ll save big bucks.<br /><br />Not that I&#039;m encouraging gun ownership. Many humans are not responsible enough to have them. That said, I don&#039;t want the federal gov&#039;t&nbsp; restricting more freedoms. It&#039;s gotta be a cultural thing where we realize that most of us are not at risk from coyotes and grizzlies. Most of us don&#039;t need to hunt food. And having a loaded gun in a house where children are present is stupid. I don&#039;t care how well you coach them, children do stupid things sometimes. Adults too.<br /><br />Firearms, nine times out of ten, don&#039;t solve problems. That&#039;s a TV-bred Chuck Norris, Ted Nugent fantasy.

				What if the owners of SR hosted a separate website exclusively for guns and other weapons? That way people could still get the guns if they wanted them without associating SR with guns. It&#039;s a win-win situation! Besides, selling guns on here is like begging for attention, LEO will redouble their efforts to take SR down.

				Should make weapons it&#039;s own site, seperate from this one.<br />The biggest problem with accepting weapons is no longer is this site now JUST the enemy of the US Feds, now every European and UK agency will be coming after it as they are extremely strict on gun control. <br /><br />There is also a safety issue. How do you cladestinely ship ammunition? If you put it in the mail system, it is taken by PASSENGER aircraft.. meaning there&#039;s now undeclared ammunition in the belly of a passenger craft. These mail bags have often been slammed against walls, run over and other things while on the ramp and inside during the flight. There&#039;s a reason ammunition must be declared to the captain and stowed away far away from vital A/C parts.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t want to be the vendor who shipped hidden ammo and have it go off accidentally killing the pilot or downing a plane. That&#039;s like terrorism charges.<br /><br />Just my $0.02<br />If you want to avoid intelligence agencies focusing their attention on this site better ban the gun sales. The DEA has limited resources but now Homeland Security, ATF, Interpol, Scotland Yard and NSA/CSIS will get involved to shut down this gun market just like they did when carding forums started selling weapons out of Spain/Turkey<br /><br />

				What does SR have to say about guns / weapons?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you guys but I personally would not want to purchase one from here anyway.&nbsp; 50/50 chance it has a small gps tracker in it from your friends at the ATF.&nbsp; Someone has already mentioned I believe you are putting the plane at risk that ships your gun by doing this.&nbsp; All around a terrible idea.<br /><br />Guns exponentially up the ante on this site, imo.&nbsp; Also, if you are a legit seller, you could potentially be selling to someone who is going to kill multiple people.&nbsp; Why would you want that on your hands?&nbsp;

				It&#039;s what agorism is all about! Whatever floats your boat without sinking mine, and owning a gun for protection is A-OK with me. The Non Aggression Principle dictates that gun ownership is JUST FINE as long as you only use it against someone who is aggressing against you. Violence to prevent injury to yourself and loved ones is ALLOWED. I&#039;m not Jesus or a Buddhist monk turning the other cheek, but that&#039;s ok for others if that&#039;s what they want. To dictate that others live that way is dead wrong. If you are dictating to others what they can and can&#039;t do, it&#039;s NOT an anonymous libertarian anarchist marketplace. Everyone seems to worry that having guns will bring heat, but the percentage of people in jail for guns is infinitesimal compared to the amount locked up for drugs. Silk Road by its very nature will bring heat, so the object should be to stay ahead of that heat. Gun sales don&#039;t give them more power or motivation to aggress against us than they already have.

				I understand what your saying I think, which is that because we are already selling drugs which are illegal and drawing attention you, you believe that adding one more illegal product isn&#039;t going to change a thing we will still be illegal. I have to say that may not be the case, I think selling or promoting the sales of weapons (I believe there is a grenade launcher for sale! lol) we may be viewed as a terrorist organization which will in turn give us way more unwanted attention rather then if it were just the drugs. If Sept.11 never happened maybe not. I think it is a bad idea!!!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />148

				Okay first of all, jewfro, writing in CAPS LOCK won&#039;t get your point across any better and it makes you look like a fool. Especially all the uncalled for name-calling. Come on dude, grow the fuck up. You sound like a prepubescent teenager about to have an aneurism. <br /><br />Second, I&#039;m all for the gun trade. I live in America and even though I don&#039;t own any firearms at the moment, I do believe in our constitutional right to bear arms. With that said, I am still deciding whether SR should allow the gun trade in their market place. <br /><br />I am on the fence because all I see right now in both arguments are speculations. The side that doesn&#039;t want guns in the marketplace CLAIM (claim is important) that it will draw further attention to SR and ultimately they are SPECULATING that it will shut down SR due to increased effort from the Government to shut us down. <br /><br />The side that says they want guns on SR believe this because they believe that SR should not be just a marketplace, but a symbol. This place is a small revolution in the technology age we now live in and they think SR shouldn&#039;t shy away from their oppressors and instead fight back. If guns will make the Government more weary of us, then good! Let them cower in fear from SR. The people that support guns on SR think SR can withhold from the attacks from the government and stay alive to flourish into this ideal symbol of a free market. <br /><br />My question to you, ALL OF YOU, is that does having the gun trade on SR really make us more vulnerable? Will it be our demise if we continue to sell firearms? Where is the proof? Can SR withstand the attacks from the government if they choose to go all out on SR? <br /><br />If SR is more vulnerable from the firearms and it will be our demise, and if taking guns out of the marketplace keep this place alive longer then I am all for abolishing firearms. At least until SR improves its defenses from attacks.&nbsp; So please, can someone answer my questions?

				@theradblur<br /><br />Exactly a large part of the issue. No one knows anything. It is pure, unsubstantiated, speculative fear. They have zero proof that gun sales will hasten SR&#039;s demise. They can only offer hypothetical situations which they believe will have the effect of rallying LE into an all out effort to shut SR down. <br /><br />The other thing is that there&#039;s no precedent for anyone to draw upon to make a reasonable argument. This is clearly a unique situation. <br /><br />The fear is so strong, that most can&#039;t even reflect on the incredible work that the owners of SR have done thus far to keep this place alive. The fear is so strong that most can&#039;t even muster a pebble&#039;s worth of faith in the owners of SR to continue to aptly defend SR from LE assault. Instead some have railed against the owners of SR going so far as calling them stupid when most if not all of them have no idea of what it takes to operate an enterprise such as this. <br /><br />The answer might look something like this; <br /><br />SR has always been under threat. The longer it exists, the greater the threat it faces. The owners of SR are acutely aware of this and take ever more stringent methods and contingencies to protect SR from LE threat. Adding guns may increase the desire of LE to institute a course of action with the purpose of halting SR from operations. But that desire doesn&#039;t automatically translate into success. It may be the case that rather than attempt to shut down SR, LE would be better served by using it as an intelligence gathering source. Something that would be easier to implement and that would yield far more data than if SR were to cease operations. They could use it to set up sting operations by posing as a seller of certain types of weapons. Plus there is political risk for a politician who rallies LE to attempt to shut SR down. Failure to shut down SR will hurt the politician, making them seem ineffectual and impotent. So even a politician would have to weigh the cost of failing. <br /><br />Sen Chuck Schumer (D-NY), one of the most powerful and influential senators in the United States,&nbsp; tried to rally the DEA and Dept of Justice back in June of last year to shut SR down. What came of it? Right, SR is still here.<br /><br />Have a little faith in SR&#039;s owners to do everything in their power to keep SR safe from LE assault. So far they&#039;ve done a damn good job. Why lose faith all of a sudden? Do you think European LE is more powerful and adept than the US&#039;s? <br /><br />Let&#039;s all get a grip and continue to enjoy the fruits bestowed upon us by the creators and maintainers of SR.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;and likely federal powers don&#039;t want to shut it down but would rather use it in other, more effective <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t think guns belong on SR at this moment in time for two reasons:<br /><br />1) While our community is vibrant and SR has implemented (what I would say to be) good security measures to protect users, adding guns to the equation this early in the game is a risk that SR isn&#039;t ready for. The illegal arms trade attracts a lot of serious negative attention and I don&#039;t think we have the resources to defend against some kind of large-scale take down. An association of violence with SR could also help push legislation similar to SOPA and PIPA into a good light and back on the table. Image isn&#039;t everything, but it counts for something if it could potentially gain a ton of negative media attention overnight (I&#039;m sure it already has, I&#039;m just posting on the fly).<br /><br />2) There aren&#039;t a ton of legitimate reasons to buy unregistered firearms. Sure, I believe that people should be able to buy their own guns, but without any kind of registration or training you&#039;re just asking for trouble. I suppose you could make a similar argument in regards to illicit substances, but the intended use of an illicit substance has nothing to do with violence. There are only three reasons in my mind why one would want to purchase an unregistered firearm: to hurt/kill someone or oneself, to avoid consequences of serious criminal charges if one&#039;s not supposed to have guns in the first place, or if firearms are completely banned in ones country. It&#039;s not a good idea, even with potential profits, to get involved in any of those situations. I just don&#039;t view SR as that kind of place.<br /><br />The first point is based entirely on speculation but I can definitely see it happening. Paranoia I suppose. The second point I&#039;ve concluded from experience as in my area it&#039;s very easy to buy firearms or get licensees that pertain to firearms and it&#039;s this way in most of the United States (unless you&#039;re under 18 or have a felony) so I just can&#039;t see why there&#039;d be a huge demand for illegal guns online. <br /><br />SR shouldn&#039;t involve itself in messy stuff like that anyway. We&#039;re too classy.

				in. And I&#039;ve done plenty of hunting and fired a wide range of weapons. I&#039;ve also worked in countries where war was occurring.<br /><br />SR has plenty on its plate without pushing the anonymous sale of weapons. Fighting the control of drugs and other panned non violent paraphernalia is a good place to start.&nbsp; <br />

It may be the case that rather than attempt to shut down SR, LE would be better served by using it as an intelligence gathering source. Something that would be easier to implement and that would yield far more data than if SR were to cease operations. They could use it to set up sting operations by posing as a seller of certain types of weapons. Plus there is political risk for a politician who rallies LE to attempt to shut SR down.

The fear of a possibility is all it takes. You have to appreciate that fear. Here is a unique market to buy quality drugs. Some that can&#039;t readily be acquired where some live. Therefore, anything perceived as hastening the loss of that market will be disliked and fought against. With that in mind, you can&#039;t expect all persons to be fully rational. Many do understand the simple philosophy of why allowing guns on Silk Road would technically be right. But as I said, the fear is much stronger. And there&#039;s no precedent to draw faith from. One can&#039;t say, &quot;well this site has been selling guns for 10 years and never had a problem with LE.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So yes, many are being selfish. But surely you can understand and appreciate why. <br /><br />There are other ways guns could be traded on here. There is the possibility of discreet listings. Listings that say one thing, but that might imply another and that require one to contact buyer before purchasing to learn of the actual details of the weapon. That was just off the cuff. Completely unpolished and likely unfeasible but it should get the brain juices flowing for those interested who may not have thought in that direction.

				I know this is all being discussed ad nauseum, but I want to weigh in.<br /><br />I fully support selling guns, as well as anything there&#039;s a demand for, through sites like this. But I just don&#039;t understand: Why can&#039;t there just be a different site for guns/hits/whatever else? The same person(s) who run SR can do it, and would still get all the ideological and financial glory from it, but it would attract much less risk. For both sites. A site that sells both guns and drugs is MUCH more of a target than 2 sites, one selling drugs and the other selling guns.<br /><br />While it would be extremely difficult to bring SR down, I don&#039;t doubt for a second that if the US .gov really went after SR it could do some serious damage. TOR is very sophisticated, but not perfect. No matter what countermeasures are taken, I just can&#039;t see believing otherwise. And there&#039;s no way of avoiding stings targeting the members; all it would take was a few highly publicized arrests to make everyone feel unsafe and substantially reduce the activity here.<br /><br />What makes having everything under the same name so beneficial that it&#039;s worth not mitigating the risk by separating things? I&#039;d submit that the ideological statement simply doesn&#039;t outweigh the risks of having a one colossal target larger than two smaller targets combined. Two separate sites is a win-win-win scenario in my eyes. <br />&nbsp;

				I like the idea of being able to buy a gun without having it officially registered in a government database; that database can be used to round up all the guns when they decide to turn this into an all out police state. The right to bear arms was written into the constitution with the intention of protecting citizens against an oppressive government. If you don&#039;t want guns to be sold on Silk Road, don&#039;t buy guns from it; they can&#039;t do business if you don&#039;t give it to them. Let the free market regulate itself!

				I don&#039;t think that guns should be allowed on Silk Road for the same reasons as many others have stated.<br /><br />Firstly it will create a lot more negative media attention than Silk Road currently already has. It&#039;ll change Silk Road in the eyes of the public as the basis for the story of &#039;Mark&#039; buying five tabs of LSD to the story of some other guy who bought a Glock 18 and shot up a school. Regardless of if that&#039;s the reality of it or not.<br /><br />Secondly I like Silk Road as it is, my secret online source of any drug I want. Guns are still available on other sites on Tor, regardless of the increased risk on other sites. But guns are overall a much riskier thing than drugs anyway. I think Silk Road would be better off as a primarily drug website. I know that guns won&#039;t affect it too much this way as it&#039;ll still sell drugs - but that&#039;s just the way I&#039;d like it to continue to be.<br /><br />Thirdly I&#039;m a bit of a pacifist. I acknowledge violence is necessary in some occasions but overall I am not in favor of supporting violence. I am too very liberal in my views but I do not think than real guns being legal is a good thing from society. (Mind you, I&#039;m from the UK and have grown up in an environment where guns aren&#039;t common or legal.)

				I agree with most on here that the sales of guns on here just brings too much unwanted attention.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for a free market place but, by including guns, it seems to me, we are just asking for the wrong type of attention.&nbsp; If there is a big enough market for the sales of guns then do it under another website.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m a Democrat with a strong belief in my 2nd amendment rights (imagine that.)&nbsp; I love guns and own many, and I believe an armed populace is good for a society.&nbsp; Not really trying to debate any of that - I am comfortable where I stand and am not offended by other viewpoints - I just wanted to provide context for my &quot;No&quot; vote.<br /><br />However, what if the owner of SR were to basically clone the site, rename everything, separate backend and hosting and everything?&nbsp; The cost would be minimal (reuse all the code, etc.), but could protect SR (the drug site) in case the other side caught too much heat.<br /><br />Regardless of who ends up owning it, I think a separate site can provide the same level of service for a different market, and the two will end up &quot;safer&quot; in the end.&nbsp; I can only hope SR is already looking into a distributed architecture for this site as it is.

				Champions of SR: &quot;This site is great! People should be able to have the freedom to not be told what they can and cannot buy, say, or do. FREEDOM!!!!! Also, nobody should ever be allowed to purchase guns.&quot;<br /><br /><br />JPIsBetterThanMe: &quot;And now for some inappropriate affect::&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8)&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And now for some inappropriate affect::&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8)
