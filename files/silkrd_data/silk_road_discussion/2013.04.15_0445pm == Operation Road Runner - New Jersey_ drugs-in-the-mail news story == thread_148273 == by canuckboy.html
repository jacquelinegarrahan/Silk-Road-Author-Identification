				Here is the story pasted in here :<br /><br /><br />LSD, Ecstasy, Cars, Cash Seized in NJ Drug Bust BRIAN THOMPSON 04/10/2013 10:06 PM<br /><br /><br />More than two dozen people have been arrested in a New Jersey drug bust that also led to the seizure of more than a dozen cars, guns, nearly $100,000 in cash and drugs that ranged from Oxycodone and Ecstasy to LSD, marijuana, steroids, hashish and psychedelic mushrooms. <br /><br />Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato said federal, state and local law enforcement arrested 25 people in several counties in what was dubbed &quot;Operation Road Runner.&quot;<br /><br />Those arrested include a Lavalette police dispatcher and an employee of the Manalapan School District. <br /><br />Coronato accused the ring of taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service&#039;s parcel service to mail drugs &quot;to numerous destinations, designed to lower transportation expenses, increase frequency of supply distribution, minimize risk and evade law enforcement authorities.&quot;<br /><br />The suspect faces varying degrees of charges involving drugs, weapons and money laundering.<br /><br />Prosecutors said additional arrests are expected in the ongoing investigation.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Photo Credit: Handout

				I think you got it right.<br /><br />Buying off Silk Road and then re Selling locally.&nbsp; &nbsp;But 2 dozen people charged sounds like a real ring.&nbsp; They couldn&#039;t all be dealers, but they all got property seized just like dealers.&nbsp; Don&#039;t end users usually just get charged?&nbsp; I&#039;m not in America.<br /><br />There is a small chance the money laundering was a major factor here.<br />

				Christ... :o<br /><br />You would think that sending drugs through the mail only came about since Silk Road.<br /><br />You are aware its been a main port of transport, and still is a frequent way for people to send drugs. Every single article relating to drugs and mail is not automatically linked to Silk Road.<br /><br />Sending drugs in the mail hasnt increased any more because of silk road, maybe slightly. The traffic of drugs from Silk Road is just a drop in the ocean of what actually gets mailed..

I understand people think it is a great idea to buy cheap online and then try to turn profit. But, you have to trust your clients as well. That is where people get fucked. If I didn&#039;t grow up with you, or have a very long term relationship with you, I don&#039;t talk to you. Greed/ignorance = prison or jail. Honestly, I would rather work a legit job and enjoy my time off. ::)

				&quot;Notice no leftover roids&quot; It&#039;s funny you say that. I&#039;ve had friends arrested on unrelated charges and cops took the steroids without mentioning in police reports. Drugs are sent in the mail all the time. People do it around here just so we don&#039;t have to drive an hour if we need something quick, we just drop it in the mail.
