				I am creating this thread here hoping that more people will see this.<br /><br />I am a friend of Choasforpeace and am trying to raise money for him.<br />Please donate to help chaosforpeace pay for a lawyer. The police confiscated all of his cash as evidence, he cannot even pay bail. He is stuck in holding until his court date. Any amount helps. I will be checking his accounts regularly.<br />Every penny counts,<br />Thanks

				While it&#039;s great you&#039;re trying to help your friend, and I hope he get&#039;s the help he needs to fight the injustices he&#039;s facing. That kid seriously needs to take this as a wake up call that he&#039;s not cut out for this kind of thing. After all the dramas he&#039;s supposedly gone through over the last few months it&#039;s time he finds a new hobby.

				Sounds like a scammer has taken over this account?<br /><br />It could be a true story as I might trust people to come here if I was locked up.<br />Really hard to give helpful proof here that would not further endanger Chaos if this is true.

He is a kid who hasn&#039;t learned from his mistakes. He kept telling me that this time there was no way for him to get caught. He told myself and one other person. Unfortunately for him that one other person had a run in with the law and rolled on chaosforpeace for everything. I believe he can get out of the serious charges if he just had a good lawyer. In my opinion they are missing allot of proof. As it is they are trying to stick him with a mandatory minimum of 20 years, probably more.<br /><br />&nbsp;He is a good person. I used to go with him to help shelters out. I know for a fact he gave most of the money he had away to charity. He told me to go on here to collect money which would be in his account from the resolution center. He stepped me through the whole thing I went in and took out the money. Now I just need to convert it to cash. I have been trying to raise money for him every way I could think of, and when I went here on the forums and started browsing around the Silk Road, I found out that his account had many posts. I then logged into it with the password he have me for his account on the main website and figured I could at least try and get something, seeing as he has so many posts. I have gone through a few of his posts and posted for help in threads he would post in.<br /><br />&nbsp;I only really know of his actions selling drugs, I have no idea about his use or any of those types of things. I am someone who believes in freedom, and I have nothing against drugs, I just choose not to go near them.<br /><br />&nbsp;The best I can do to prove I am a friend of chaosforpeace trying to help him out is answer personal questions about him privately. I have known him for a long time. I don&#039;t want to expose his identity, but if you know something I can respond so that it can be confirmed that I do indeed know him.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am really trying my hardest to help the guy out. I don&#039;t know how to prove I am not a thief or anything, but I beg you all to believe me. If anyone has a recommendation on how I can prove it I am open to anything.<br /><br />I do fear giving away to many details about his situation and having him identified, but I am glad to supply whatever I can to help anyone to donate anything.<br /><br />I am at a point where I don&#039;t know anything else to do. I have no money myself, and I am struggling to raise anything for him.

				If no one credible speaks up as knowing personal stuff about Chaos, I&#039;d PM scout. If he believes ya, I&#039;d trust his judgment. LE could well have his accounts now and they may know some personal stuff so this is not an easy situation.

Scout went through all of my posts asking for help to donate and wrote scam on them.<br />Thank you scout for unlocking this thread, but now everyone will assume I am a scammer so no one will want to help chaosforpeace. Its really a damn shame and as I said I am glad to do the best I can, but it is just that, the best I can.<br /><br />I came on here asking for help for him assuming that no one would help anyway. It seems that is the way that it will be because of this assumption that I am a thief.<br /><br />Either way I thank the silk road for returning the moneys that chaosforpeace was scammed out of, I have withdrawn it and now have a method of switching it to cash. This will help somewhat with getting a lawyer.<br />I have written a letter to the dread pirate Roberts thanking him for this profusely.<br />Thanks anyway everyone,<br />Steve

As I said he never created a vendor account.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, in your PM to me you mentioned he was a dealer, so I thought you meant he had a vendor account here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m still really confused about your story.&nbsp; He gave you his username and password, and you&#039;re familiar with SR ... why aren&#039;t you posting from your own account?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Again he told me about the silk road and gave me instructions on how to get the money out of his account. I have been here online all day learning about the road and reading everything I could find. I have spent hours studying today before I posted. I believe I read through the whole wiki.<br />I have no account on the road and to be honest even with everything I have learned I would never create an account on here. I don&#039;t even feel safe posting from his account or even going to the URL. I am just trying everything to help the kid out.<br /><br />He was supplying a few dealers and was caught with a large amount of marijuana and cocaine.

				I suspect that this is genuine. I don&#039;t have any coin but wish your friend the best of luck. Seemed like a nice kid, and no one deserves to be treated the way he is for non-violent &#039;offenses&#039;. Posting on these boards offers fairly constant reminders of how the drug war is destroying peoples lives, I hope your friend manages to be one of the lucky ones that get away.<br /><br />

				Well I would like to point out I personally believe this is a SCAM and here is why that is.<br /><br />Here is a post from Chaos on 5/15<br /><br />&quot;Re: Help a trusted hero member of the Silk Road beat his charges and go free<br />« Reply #11 on: Today at 08:09 am »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br /><br />Quote from: onezero32 on Today at 07:19 am<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; While it&#039;s great you&#039;re trying to help your friend, and I hope he get&#039;s the help he needs to fight the injustices he&#039;s facing. That kid seriously needs to take this as a wake up call that he&#039;s not cut out for this kind of thing. After all the dramas he&#039;s supposedly gone through over the last few months it&#039;s time he finds a new hobby.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Well that is just it. He is a kid who hasn&#039;t learned from his mistakes. He kept telling me that this time there was no way for him to get caught. He told myself and one other person. Unfortunately for him that one other person had a run in with the law and rolled on chaosforpeace for everything. I believe he can get out of the serious charges if he just had a good lawyer. In my opinion they are missing allot of proof. As it is they are trying to stick him with a mandatory minimum of 20 years, probably more.&quot;<br /><br />PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPELLING OF ALLOT, AS MOST SPELL IT &quot;A LOT&quot; OR &quot;ALOT&quot; BUT FEW SPELL IT &quot;ALLOT&quot;<br /><br />now look at a post from 4/15<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148971.msg1027942#msg1027942<br /><br />&quot;Silk Road discussion / Re: Someone ordered 25 kilos from China 21 days ago<br />« on: April 18, 2013, 02:21 pm »<br />Dr. Gonzo is one of the most trusted members of the road. If this was fake than Dr. Gonzo would have been charged an SR fee for buying his own item. At 70,000$ Dr. Gonzo paid SR 1,050$ in fee&#039;s.<br />Most likely this is just a buyer who purchased from the Docter multiple times so he trusts him. It would show allot on how trustworthy the Docter is because if someone else was in the same position with 70,000$, well would you do the same and ship the product or keep it?<br /><br />Chaos <br />&quot;<br /><br />PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPELLING OF ALLOT, AS MOST SPELL IT &quot;A LOT&quot; OR &quot;ALOT&quot; BUT FEW SPELL IT &quot;ALLOT&quot;<br /><br />The same ODD misspelling of a word a month before he was arrested<br /><br />make your own conclusions

It seems that is the way that it will be because of this assumption that I am a thief.<br /><br />Either way I thank the silk road for returning the moneys that chaosforpeace was scammed out of, I have withdrawn it and now have a method of switching it to cash.

OTOH i doubt anyone will donate, even if they believe you 100%, you&#039;ll probably be on your own as far as raising bail or attorney money. Maybe upload a scanned warrant with the sensitive info blacked out. Or a newspaper article if that contains enough proof, if you want any chance of receiving money from the community, you can&#039;t just ask.<br /><br />You really want to help your friend? Get off this account and stay off, create your own start selling from here and raise enough&nbsp; for him that way. Learn from his mistakes and don&#039;t repeat them.<br /><br />Good luck to both of you, and tell chaos im pulling for him but i cant spare any coins at the moment.

				Where is the link to the vendor account. Not that I would ever donate to something as blatant of a scam as this, but he should at the very least try to make it seem legit.<br /><br />All we have is a BTC address and some emo posting.<br /><br />Post the case details, post the lead investigator.

I personally don&#039;t go near drugs. I have no problem with them and I believe it&#039;s a persons choice, but I just don&#039;t touch them. I might care for the guy, but not enough to risk my own life.<br />

That kid seriously needs to take this as a wake up call that he&#039;s not cut out for this kind of thing. After all the dramas he&#039;s supposedly gone through over the last few months it&#039;s time he finds a new hobby.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Well that is just it. He is a kid who hasn&#039;t learned from his mistakes. He kept telling me that this time there was no way for him to get caught. He told myself and one other person. Unfortunately for him that one other person had a run in with the law and rolled on chaosforpeace for everything. I believe he can get out of the serious charges if he just had a good lawyer. In my opinion they are missing allot of proof. As it is they are trying to stick him with a mandatory minimum of 20 years, probably more.&quot;<br /><br />PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPELLING OF ALLOT, AS MOST SPELL IT &quot;A LOT&quot; OR &quot;ALOT&quot; BUT FEW SPELL IT &quot;ALLOT&quot;<br /><br />now look at a post from 4/15<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148971.msg1027942#msg1027942<br /><br />&quot;Silk Road discussion / Re: Someone ordered 25 kilos from China 21 days ago<br />« on: April 18, 2013, 02:21 pm »<br />Dr. Gonzo is one of the most trusted members of the road. If this was fake than Dr. Gonzo would have been charged an SR fee for buying his own item. At 70,000$ Dr. Gonzo paid SR 1,050$ in fee&#039;s.<br />Most likely this is just a buyer who purchased from the Docter multiple times so he trusts him. It would show allot on how trustworthy the Docter is because if someone else was in the same position with 70,000$, well would you do the same and ship the product or keep it?<br /><br />Chaos <br />&quot;<br /><br />PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPELLING OF ALLOT, AS MOST SPELL IT &quot;A LOT&quot; OR &quot;ALOT&quot; BUT FEW SPELL IT &quot;ALLOT&quot;<br /><br />The same ODD misspelling of a word a month before he was arrested<br /><br />make your own conclusions<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You beat me to it, wraithe. When I noticed the rare misspelling of &#039;a lot&#039; on the first page I searched for previous posts; lo and behold - &#039;allot&#039; appears earlier. This is a VERY uncommon misspelling. This is not the posting of a friend, which I found highly suspect from the outset. If I was incarcerated it would be foolish of me (not to mention incredibly difficult) to give explicit instructions on how to access my Tor/SR/Forum info. Not to mention that most lines of communication to/from penitentiaries are monitored.<br /><br />The overall situation could be truthful, but when an untruth is discovered in the foundation of the story the entire premise is called into question. As was previously stated, handouts will not suffice in this case. If it&#039;s a RICO then we&#039;re talking tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees; this nickel and dime stuff won&#039;t even scratch the surface.<br /><br />So Chaos, if you are in legal trouble I wish you the best of luck. Get an excellent lawyer and put him to work. A chemist friend of mine was sentenced to 20 years after he was caught transporting MDMA across state lines (they didn&#039;t even find his lab). His lawyer got him out in a little under three. The same friend also took a lot of weight for a few of us when he was caught with a trunk full of another substance - the same lawyer got him off scot-free. If you&#039;re young then the chances at having racketeering and &#039;drug kingpin&#039; charges leveled and hitting you full-bore are slim.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160724.msg1137043#msg1137043">Quote from: Chaosforpeace on May 17, 2013, 09:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">People are there for you always, but the second money is involved everyone disappears.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This means that they&#039;re not there for you &#039;always&#039;. Anyone who&#039;s loyal will give whatever it takes - time, energy, money, and even their own health (thanks Mom). Hell, most of the goofballs I know would rather throw money at a problem instead of their time. The caveat is that they need to believe in the cause.

Also, the last thing he or you should be doing if this was true is giving out any information on this forum. You should be distancing yourself from SR as much as possible.

				There is a way you can prove this story is true without making Chaos&#039;s identity public. It would take about 4 days.<br /><br />Pick a trusted member of the community -- I would recommend a mod who is US-based.<br /><br />Give that person Choas&#039;s name and the address of the jail where he is incarcerated. They write him an anonymous letter with a word or phrase.<br /><br />He gives you the authentication phrase and you post it back on the forum. The trusted person verifies it.<br /><br />You might know someone else who is incarcerated right now and willing to accept the letter and give you the phrase. You (the real Chaos) might even offer to give him a cut of the money you make off this scam.<br /><br />That&#039;s where level 2 authentication comes in. With the amounts involved, this is almost certainly a federal case. All federal cases are logged in PACER. The trusted person could search PACER and verify that a case exists for that person in that federal court district, with exactly those charges (marijuana and cocaine).<br /><br />You need to register an account and provide a credit card number to use PACER (although you can verify the case exists for free), but I can tell you how to do that safely, without compromising your identity.<br />

				I find this hard to believe.. Why would just a &quot;kid&quot; be donating all his earnings to charity from selling cocaine and marijuana?&nbsp; Where are his parents/family?<br /><br />You say that he had money in resolution and he gave you instructions on how to get a refund...exactly how did he tell you this? I know every phone call is monitored and recorded in jail, and every letter sent is read.&nbsp; LE would be all over his SR and forum account if this was true. <br /><br />I call bull shit...OP knows way too much about SR doesn&#039;t sound like a noobie.

				Okay, I thought I might have jumped the &quot;It&#039;s a scam.&quot; gun last night so I edited my statement .... but after reading the rest of the posts that have been made since then, I&#039;m even more sure this is a scam and there are too many holes in this strange story.<br /><br />I mean, like &quot;ALLOT&quot; of holes.&nbsp;
