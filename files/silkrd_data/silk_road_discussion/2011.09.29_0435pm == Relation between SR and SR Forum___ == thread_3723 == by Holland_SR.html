				<br />Are the main site and the forum run by the same people??<br /><br />Having a particular username on SR doesn&#039;t automatically get you the same name/pw on the forum right?<br /><br />It would be a security risk if they are two different beasts, I am sure many people will use the same password for SR and for the forum..

				people shouldn&#039;t be lazy dealing with their own security. This is official SR forums, same owners etc. I remember forums used to be on the main site. There must be a good reason for them to be separately. One thing that pops into mind that this one even if the main site goes down we will still have a way to get official information.
