				Can someone please tell me what FE means? In the chemical world, it means iron, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what it means here. Sorry if it&#039;s a stupid question, but I have looked high and low.

				It means finalizing early.&nbsp; Even if you are a new buyer NEVER do this.&nbsp; I learned the hard way when I was a new buyer.&nbsp; Basically if you Finalize Early and the vendor never ships, you are shit out of luck and can never get your money back.

				Yes, it means finalize early in the sense that when you make your purchase, if you were to finalize early, you&#039;d be releasing your funds from escrow and the vendor would then obtain them. This is essentially losing protection from getting scammed, or gettinghelp if your order doesn&#039;t arrive, etc. It is strongly suggested that you not FE even though some vendors might insist on this.

				Thank you all very much! I will definitely be checking out the rumour mill.<br /><br />One more thing:<br /><br />Does anybody have a preferred way to get Bit Coins?

				I&#039;ll vouch for SugarMama and CaptainMal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard bad things about either of them, but bear in mind I get my bitcoins a different way and can&#039;t speak for them personally.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve heard good things about Blue Sky Traders, but... less good things, I think, but I don&#039;t pay that much attention personally.

Just put in your city and country. Look for someone who offers at a realistic price and has got some feedback. Send them a message. Most of the times they will send you a phone number. Than just meet up and buy your coins, and you are good to go :) take your qp code with you as most of them use a mobile to transfer the coins. set up a throw wallet on blockchain or others. I heard good things about strongcoin aswell.<br /><br />Have fun! <br /><br />ps. id advice to pm sugar mama on SR if you want to cash in MP or WU for BTC. Shes very nice and helpful!

				Oh, you&#039;re asking *that* -- sorry.&nbsp; The names I &quot;vouched&quot; for (again, never used them personally) are vendors on Silk Road that will sell you bitcoins in exchange for Moneypaks (MP).&nbsp; Or you can go through www.bitinstant.com.&nbsp; Or find somebody to buy from on localbitcoins.com.&nbsp; People have had some trouble with bitinstant.com lately, FYI.&nbsp; Nothing that resulted in total loss, but definitely a lot of delays and having to contact their support have been popping up lately.

				I too have heard very good things about captainmal but cannot speak from personal experience as I&#039;ve never used him. I used to use mtgox.com but since they stopped accepting bank deposits, I found another source. Now I use localbitcoins.com and it has worked out pretty well.
