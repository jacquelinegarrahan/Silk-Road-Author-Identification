				I also remember it being here and not working. I would like a (functional!) version of it back, very much! I often look for the lowest price anyways (of course) and it is quite tedious to sometimes look through pages and pages of wares to find the cheapest things only to forget if the thing on the previous page might have been the same value for a few BTC cheaper.

				Yea I used it when it was there and it seemed to work pretty well. Some high price items were mixed in but having a slightly screwed up sorting is alot better than no sorting at all.<br />Plus I&#039;m sure the majority of us are not buying QP&#039;s of weed or 10 grams of 25i-nBOME, it&#039;s making us look the entire listings of a product to find items in our price range.

				There were a few threads on this after the feature was removed, but never a reply by anyone official. I think they don&#039;t want the feature, regardless of glitches. Maybe vendors didn&#039;t want it? It&#039;s not a hard thing to add or fix if fucked, so that&#039;s my theory.

				&#039;Back in the days&#039; i like to use the feature, to find products for the coins left in my account after an order.<br /><br />Nowadays i like to trawl through the offers in the categorys, to see what&#039;s best-selling and tbh mostly i find something i like very fast. Imo it won&#039;t be a lose to have that feature, but it&#039;s not necessary to have it, as long many ppl would use it and it would be easier for scammers to get their listings viewed. But w/o this sorting option it&#039;s harder for new vendors to get attention, but for that i think they have the forum :)

				One of the problems is some sellers price their items in Bits and some do it in USD and I would guess that they are not compatible with each other when doing a high to low search. If everyone priced their items the same the feature probably would work better, contrary to what some think you cannot just program everything the way you would like as some things are just not meant to work together.

				I definitely think there should be one. It&#039;s really good at the moment (being able to sort it in three ways) but adding this function would be a big improvement in my opinion. If it was implemented, I guess it should probably exclude postal costs because then it might get a bit complicated. Go on, silk road, you know you want to.

				Even if shipping wasn&#039;t included.. with the way the new site is, it would be very easy to organize the prices on the right.. seeing the country one could average in shipping costs.

I for one would like to be able to sort by country too or instead (to skip over the NL vendors).

				I wouldn&#039;t so much mind the shipping costs.<br />Not really sure why folks are opposed to additional filters. If you don&#039;t like them, don&#039;t use them.

				<br />I WOULD LOVE THIS.&nbsp; I often find myself wishing it was already incorporated in the SR system. I use the low-to high price search in most all of my online purchases. <br /><br />I would def welcome it !!!

				I think it would be a great addition but it should be a minimum of 3 to 5 coins. I personally haven&#039;t found anything worth buying cheaper than 5 coins.

				A low-to-high option would be cool, but I really wish there was a Vendor Search.&nbsp; For instance, if you wanted to see which vendors had the most transactions, ranking, or percentage of completions.&nbsp;
