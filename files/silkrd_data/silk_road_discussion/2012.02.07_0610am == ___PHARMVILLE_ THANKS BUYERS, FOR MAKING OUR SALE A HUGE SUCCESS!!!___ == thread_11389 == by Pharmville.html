				Hi Everybody,<br /><br />WOWOWOWOWOW!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;The Buyer&#039;s Appreciation sale was a *HUGE* success at Pharmville.&nbsp; Never in a million years did Ben and I expect that we would receive THIS MANY orders in just one weekend.&nbsp; So we thank all the buyers who stopped by, some of which we hadn&#039;t seen for a long time and a whole lot that are brand new.&nbsp; We are working almost around the clock to get your orders out to you as fast as possible.<br /><br />In that same vein, the flow has started of people sending pm&#039;s asking &quot;did my order ship?&quot; and this is the first thing I saw when I opened the page to start posting the shipping confirmations for today.&nbsp; Honestly, if I stop and take the time to answer every &quot;did my order ship?&quot; pm, most of the orders are going to be delayed by at least one day, and that&#039;s simply unacceptable. <br /><br />SO...I am posting here the situation as it stands right now:<br /><br />1. Every Express Mail order that was placed through midnight Sunday has shipped and your order confirmations are going out tonight, just hold on and you&#039;ll get it in the next couple of hours.<br /><br />2. Every Priority Mail order that was placed by around 8pm EST on Sunday night has been shipped and your order confirmations are coming to you in the next couple of hours.<br /><br />3. A large portion (about half) of the First Class orders that were placed before the end of the Buyer Appreciation sale were shipped today and your shipping confirmations are coming to you in the next couple of hours.<br /><br />We are going to try our hardest to ship every order in house tomorrow, including all the ones that were placed on Monday and will be placed by 9am on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; If you placed an Express or Priority order after the end of the Buyer&#039;s Appreciation weekend, you order will DEFINITELY get shipped on Tuesday. <br /><br />The only *possible chance* we have to pull this off is to do nothing but pull, pack and ship orders and only answer the pm&#039;s that have urgent questions and pertain to existing or potential orders.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve sent a &quot;when is my order shipping&#039; pm please don&#039;t be upset but it&#039;s going to be deleted unanswered.&nbsp; I&#039;ve asked several times in this forum to please not send this kind of pm in the first place because if you just let the system work you find out the answer at the soonest possible date anyway.&nbsp; BUT...this time there are so many orders and so many &quot;when is my order shipping&quot; pm&#039;s that answering them would be the difference in getting all or almost all of them shipped on Tuesday vs just barely making a dent in them and being behind the 8 ball all week on shipping. <br /><br />As regards new orders for the rest of the week: until you hear different from me right here on this forum, plan on it taking 48 hours for First Class orders to ship, but Express and Priority will still go within 24 hours, as always. <br /><br />Hopefully, I&#039;ll be back tomorrow night with the GOOD NEWS that we shipped every single order and that things are back to normal.<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone for making the sale a HUGE SUCCESS.&nbsp; One note: Mr. SR-please give us at least 10 days notice for the next big sale and we promise to be totally prepared for the onslaught we know will come. :)<br /><br />Have a great evening everyone,<br />&gt;Alex &amp; Ben&lt;<br />

				You can&#039;t really expect something in 36 hours unless you payed for the overnight shipping, even then the USPS has laid off a lot of people so it sometimes takes 2 days for overnight shipping anyways.&nbsp; SR is about patience.

Not that it didn&#039;t arrive, and as they advertise sending out shipments in 24 hours I was wondering if everything was still cool. I&#039;m happy to wait for shipments brother and &#039;preciate your concern.
