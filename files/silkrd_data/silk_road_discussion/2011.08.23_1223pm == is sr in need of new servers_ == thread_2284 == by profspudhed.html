				Ive noticed especially over the last few days more than ever that the site seems to struggle to load, it only seems to be a problem during the day (around 7am to 5pm gmt) are we seeing mega traffic at those hours or is there some other problem causing all these 504 and 502 errors, i must have made over 100 refreshes yesterday just to get the main page to load once then it usually crashes to 504 when you try and load a listing or other page, to begin with i thought it was all onion sites that have these kinds of probs but ive had no prob getting on here all morn, sr however has yet to load once despite well over 20 attempts

				The last few days have been an exercise in frustration when trying to log on to SR.&nbsp; I get &quot;502 Server dropped connection&quot; over and over again. The only thing that seems to occasionally work is to stop Tor and then restart.&nbsp; But I have very little trouble connecting to the forums. I guess people are more interested in shopping for stuff.&nbsp;

				Tor itself has been sporadic lately, and a lot of traffic bottlenecks at Silk Road.<br /><br />I have had a bit of trouble lately, and increasingly bad behavior from Tor and it&#039;s nodes.<br /><br />Hopefully this is just congestion, and yes I&#039;m sure new servers would be great...but I&#039;d expect Silk Road to have something scaled out<br /><br />well for now as far as hardware goes. Much time has gone into it.<br /><br />ï£¿b

				anyone else get that weird screen where it&#039;s just blue lines and text? Like the graphics are gone, and it&#039;s just basic text like you typed it out in email...When I stop/reload/use new identity it works but very sporadically.

Means you either have a buggy wifi driver (if you&#039;re even using wifi), a different driver, or maybe faulty hardware, but most likely a nasty virus. Reformat your hard drive, re-install your Windows then go read up on how to protect yourself.

				Don&#039;t reformat your hard drive yet, Gordo! What you are seeing is partially downloaded content. You get the main text but the stylesheet of the webpage did not download correctly. A reload will fix this. It happens when there are traffic congestion in a network, especially so with TOR.
