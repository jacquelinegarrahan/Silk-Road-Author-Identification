				Studio54<br /><br />Hello... Could you PLEASE do me all a favor and explain what in the heck you are talking about? I know the super nerds will understand you but I honestly have no idea what you are talking about. And they are busy right now finding the next Leo to &quot;MAYBE&quot; expose. Because I am sure someone ordered a single pill and his name has a C in it and that means he is a COP!! Or they are gathering&nbsp; info just in case SR gets shut down in the next 12 hours because there has been some really strange shit on here lately. Its possible DPR has been compromised and they forced him to send that message about the &quot;new site&quot; so they can fish us all. DPR on purpose used the wrong key to give us a clue he needs HELP!<br /><br />This is a serious matter. Until it is solved ...SR should be on Defcon 3. I have removed all my listings and I am waiting for the next bit of news. This is seriously fucked up. Pirate MAY NEED OUR HELP!<br /><br />The Gawker article was a sign.<br /><br />SELL YOUR BTC NOW!!!!<br /><br />I think DPR is working with the&nbsp; federal agency I.C.E. Is it not&nbsp; weird he has been gone since 4/20 and now he made 2 post or more today???? The week AFTER Friday the 14th?????<br /><br />Better safe then sorry.<br /><br />I think all messages should be in PGP for now on in here. My last package was a hand written address. AND EVERYONE knows that is a HUGE tip off to the post office that the package has drugs in it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Digi didn&#039;t &quot;leave&quot; he went in to witness protection. Hasn&#039;t&nbsp; everyone noticed the drop in vendors? And don&#039;t you find it strange DPR chose right after the Gawker article to come out with a &quot;new system?&quot; I think it is a tracking system. Tony 76 was a federal agent. They did that to get us all against each other. In the Myan calendar Friday the 14th is very bad. WE JUST HAD FRIDAY THE 14TH A WEEK AGO!!! DOES THAT NOT SEEM STRANGE????<br /><br />And Howard Stern as the judge on Americas got talent????? Everyone knows he is a CIA agent. IF you take his name, the S and the R stand out...Silk Road!!!!!!!!!! OMG<br /><br />Listen you can think I am crazy, but look at D7994rj8t5. Google it. Everyone knows they busted him because he used the Iphone app to access onion. And the FBI owns that app. HE was a vendor in the early SR days.<br /><br />&nbsp;I will update you later when it is confirmed it&#039;s safe on SR.(no way it can be)<br /><br />

				RxKing, the only thing I agree with you on is that the OP didn&#039;t explain what he&#039;s talking about.<br /><br />But the rest of what you wrote sounds truly bizarre. You write like a true schizoid personality, or worse. Were you high when you wrote that or what?<br /><br />goblin

				LOL<br /><br />All I was doing was writing a post how about 80% of the posters sound. Fucking crazy and paranoid.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everything I wrote is actual shit that has been posted in this forum.<br /><br />Everything.<br /><br />I also addressed how fucking stupid the OP was. I addressed a few post with this bullshit.<br /><br />There is a thread titled in this forum titled &quot;&nbsp; New seller accounts&quot;&nbsp; that is over 1 year old that goblin posted in as if the information was fresh.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t even read the thread!! Yet he posted as if it was a new thread and read the info. This is a&nbsp; common practice. What&#039;s even better is he went back after I posted WTF and I quoted him and&nbsp; explained how old the thread is and that it would be nice if he actually took the time to read what he is talking about.<br /><br />He has since deleted his post. Yet you can still read his bullshit since I quoted him.<br /><br />I was hoping that people would read this bullshit and realize how stupid it sounds and would maybe tone down the bullshit post.<br /><br />Sorry you didn&#039;t realize I was being sarcastic&nbsp; ;) OBV goblin didn&#039;t either.

				I don&#039;t really get the point, when you&#039;re sending coins to SR, it&#039;s up to you to set the transaction fee and afaik SR is counting the confirmations on the btc address which you sent the coins to. That they are splitting the coins to several addresses afterwards, shouldn&#039;t affect the time&nbsp; which the 6 confirmations needs on your initial btc address.<br />I also think, that when you&#039;re transferring coins SR internal, there won&#039;t be real btc traffic, as long it&#039;s just a db (or whatever system used) entry. That&#039;s the reason why SR internal btc traffic is an instant traffic.<br />Please correct me on any point, if i&#039;m wrong :)

It would at least be an excuse for your terrible post(s). If you were trying to be funny in them.. you failed. Every post you make is worse then the one before.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how many times you need to hear there is no fee that SR charges when they send coin out. Nothing you could ever adjust anyways. Yes we all know about the .0005 &quot;fee&quot; there is for sending out coin. It does not exist on our end. That&#039;s why you can&#039;t find anything on it.<br /><br />You do realize when you post that the red line under a word means you misspelled it ? That means you should fix the word. <br /><br />They should have put a red line under your whole post, not for spelling, but because it just made no sense.<br /><br />I&#039;ll play your game though.....let&#039;s say there was a fee...how would that affect cops raping you? What do you even mean by that?<br /><br />And quit say &quot;we&quot; like your a team of people. There is no way a team would write this shit. <br />

I normally do not even pay attention to things you post. I understand that you have computer skills. You just have no other talent. Just your basic nerd. But in a bad way. I don&#039;t want to give nerds a bad name.

Smart of you actually to not address how you just made up &quot;facts&quot;.

				Even better then the last post is when that person get quoted and then comes back in the thread AGAIN and doesn&#039;t respond but deletes the post they made that was quoted!! Just proof you got pawned. Good job SHANON. <br /><br />You were best to leave this thread after you got called out for lying in it. Just think if you don&#039;t post in this thread again it will just go away. ;)

				Hey bungee,<br /><br />to clear things out, a transaction fee is NOT mandatory. When you&#039;re sending coins with the latest bitcoin client, the fee is mandatory, when you&#039;re using older or alternative clients, you do not have to pay transaction fee but you CAN pay it.<br />You&#039;re right, that paying more fee will give you a higher priority for the block, but I can truly believe, that SR doesn&#039;t take any fee for withdrawal and so it won&#039;t be possible to fasten up the withdraw.<br />At first i thought you were talking about deposit coins to SR, but now I hopefully got your point :)

				Yeah you got my point !<br /><br /><br />of course it is not mandatory ..and we do not pay a withdrawal fee..but sr is probaably including a fee which of course is not rolled over to us as it is miniscule..<br />Probably it can be seen in the blockchain..i will check it as soon as i make the first withdrawal.<br /><br />Thanks for answering in a civilised way :)<br /><br />Cheers!

				I don&#039;t withdraw coins from SR too often ;)<br />At the end, does it really matter, if you wit 60minutes (approx time for 6 confirmations) or up to about 30minutes more ? ;)<br />For me it won&#039;t make a big difference
