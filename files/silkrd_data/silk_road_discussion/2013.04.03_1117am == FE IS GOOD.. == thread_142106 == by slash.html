				I think my buyer stats are less important to me than assuring others that the vendor isn&#039;t scamming or worse. It defeats the whole purpose of being able to leave feedback if you simply FE early. For all you or the community knows, someone sent you a blotter sheet with nothing but a pretty picture on it. 8)

				It depends on who asks. For me, as&nbsp; a vendor it is a haven - but I never ask about FE, never, sometimes buyers FE just like that.<br /><br />What I always ask is to FE ASAP the product is in your hand. Because it&#039;s just how it supposed to be...simple.
