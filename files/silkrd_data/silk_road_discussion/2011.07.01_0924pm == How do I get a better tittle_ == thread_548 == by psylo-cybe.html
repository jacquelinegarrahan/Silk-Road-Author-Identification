				I am one of the original vendor/buyers here at SR...and my tittle says &quot;newbie&quot;...is that just for the new forums? I mean, give me something that shows my status here.

				i think its based on how often you post. i got to SR post Gawker (~6000) and registered on the forum as soon as it launched, but am still a &quot;newbie&quot; here.<br /><br />in any case, since plenty of legit people are labeled &quot;newbie&quot;, I don&#039;t pay it much mind. reputation is far more important.<br /><br />Edit: Also, I like it when sellers link to their SR profile in their forum profile and vice versa, that way we know they&#039;re the same user and can confirm reputation.

				Purely based on your post count. Think of it as number representing the likely-hood the profile has no job other than selling, or is addicted to the net.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I do realize but I rarely get a chance to inject humor, so when I can, I do. If you look at the rest of my post you will realize that most of my post find a helpful tone; I do believe that I rarely leave a post containing no help or at least a review of a vendor/subject.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t mean I am not addicted to the net. Also doesn&#039;t mean I am just just a dealer. I also work in web design, hosting, graphic design, web application, and server administration/IT.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />But I digress, you are indeed correct. Many frequenters of the forum are helpful users trying to pass along things to those new. <br /><br />Indeedily,<br />DigitalAlch
