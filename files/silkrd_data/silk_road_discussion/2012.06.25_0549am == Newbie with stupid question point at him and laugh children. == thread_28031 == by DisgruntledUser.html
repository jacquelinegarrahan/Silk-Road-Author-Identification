				Hello there everyone! <br /><br />I am a new to SR and I have gone through the seven stages of amazment at being in this Willy Wonka factory of drug awesome. Anyway, I understand that people won&#039;t sell to new people as they may be scammers or other, so I&#039;m wondering what I should be buying first, or if anyone WILL deal with me for something small to build up a credit history.<br /><br />Also, trying to work out PGP encryption is rupturing my non-IT inclined brain.

				There are some users who will not deal with new people at all, just for their own safety. However, there are a few vendors that will either:<br />A) Sell to new users without any problem.<br />B) Sell to new users, but require them to FE (finalize early).<br /><br />Finalizing early, depending on the reputation of the vendor is usually trouble-free. You&#039;re basically paying them for the item before you actually receive it. However, if your item is lost/seized/stolen, you&#039;re out of luck as far as refunds go. (Some vendors will work with you, but not many that I know of, at least.)<br /><br />Some people will recommend buying little random items to build up a transaction history, but I never did this, and everyone sells to me without a problem.<br /><br />I hope this helps,<br /><br />sdesu

				Like said before, buying smaller amounts or less &quot;controlled&quot; substances (I started out with fitness related gear Clen, T3, Test CP) a few digital books, Money Pak for BTC exchange (careful who you chose) will build up your transaction history. <br /><br />For other itamz, I sent a message to the vendor about my buyer status and requesting how they&#039;re wanting to conduct business. I&#039;m comfortable doing FE with vendors that have 100+ transactions but willing to pass up if that is not the case. <br />

				I&#039;m new here but it&#039;s never caused me any problems along the lines of people refusing to sell to me, etc, just based on that. I&#039;ve been asked to finalize early on a couple of occasions, but I&#039;ve never considered it much of a risk seeing as I&#039;ve always stuck with the most reputable vendors for the most part (lots of transaction history and really good feedback ratings).

				I&#039;m new too. Regardless of how vendors feel about new people, I plan on starting off small to get acquainted with SR. Maybe start with a few digital purchases, then move up to some legal products. When I&#039;m very comfortable, I&#039;ll order contraband.

				I bought from trusted sellers UKpharm and plutopete for my first buys, had to FE for one but plutopete trusted me being a new seller but I think I FE any giving their good stats. I recommend buying from trusted sellers from your own country first and FE&#039;ing if they ask as I got both my packages in three days. That was pretty neat and your purchasing stats will build up quick

				Well if you want to laugh at a newbie, have at it. Hi all, I&#039;m a dissident from the Topix forum and am looking for a more reliable place to do business. Now, I was looking at one of my favorite items and the price listed was B2.15 each. Can I assume this to mean that it would cost me over 16 dollars for one unit?!?!&nbsp; If so, that price would be far beyond totally insane..!!!!

				https://mtgox.com/ has the current exchange rate.&nbsp; 2.15btc is about $13 at the moment.&nbsp; When i first came here I thought it was pricey.&nbsp; However, for weed, I have found the quality to be pretty good and you always get the weight you paid for rather than some random street deal.&nbsp; Also, remember you are covering postage, packing and Silk Road commission.<br /><br />To the OP:&nbsp; Some vendors may stay in escrow for you, but if not just find a trustworthy long term vendor in your own country, start with small amounts and finalize early.&nbsp; Clearly it&#039;s best to stay in escrow if at all possible, but it&#039;s understandable that many vendors are wary of new buyers.

				hey, everyone has to start somewhere. I have no problem selling small amounts to new buyers using escrow, what I won&#039;t do is ship out a large order. I also don&#039;t sell to new buyers who pepper me with suspicious questions. I do appreciate it when I new buyer pms me first, but I don&#039;t require it. I usually ask if they have purchased before, and from whom, but if it is their first purchase that&#039;s ok.
