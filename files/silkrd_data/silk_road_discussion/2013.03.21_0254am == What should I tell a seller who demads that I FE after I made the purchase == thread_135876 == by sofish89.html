				I made a purchase from a seller who has no mention on his vendor or product page about ever FE&#039;ing. I have 4 sucessful purchases in the last month. After i made a purchse (from a domestic seller), he demanded that I FE due to my low stats and then he will send out my package. What should I do?

				Do not finalize early for anyone.<br /><br />Just like others have said: Request that the vendor cancel your order, or cancel it yourself when the option is available, and explain that you only order from vendors that do not request FE.

				Ask to have the order canceled by the vendor, then work on your buyer stats elsewhere on the Road.

				Exact same thing happened to me. It&#039;s very frustrating. I chose to FE as it was not a large order and they didn&#039;t seem like a scammer based on sales volumes and feedback history. On the plus side if you chose to FE, you can leave feedback detailing your negative experience with the vendor. Now I look specifically for the phrase &quot;do not require FE&quot; or similar in vendor profiles.

				UPDATE<br />I replied to him that if he is worried about me scamming him he should get a DCN (tracking number) but I am unwilling to go out of escrow. So if you are unwilling to ship to me using escrow then please go ahead and cancel the order.<br />His reply: That is fine, I will ship with tracking number.

				Yeah I have put in a ton of orders for lots of different stuff and never once had to FE for anything. Clearly not everyone who asks for FE is a scammer but every scammer asks for FE.<br /><br />It takes a little shopping around and a few small orders to build up some buying stats but I&#039;m pretty sure I would shop somewhere else before I agreed to finalize early for a product I don&#039;t have from a vendor I don&#039;t know purchased on an anonymous internet site. &quot;FE for trusted vendor&quot; is about the same in my mind as bending over with my pants around my ankles in a bathroom stall with a large drunk man behind me promising to do a free prostate exam as long as I don&#039;t scream.

				i have asked people to FE if they are a new buyer, it comes down to a few things. As a vendor selling to someone say (2/0) and he only spent .8btc, im a bit skeptical on this guy making a 6btc purchase from me, my reviews and satisfied customers are the reason why you in the first place considered purchasing from me, so in hand,trust yourself. Its not hard for a new buyer to say &quot;oh i never received my qp of weed, reship or refund. Alot more at risk for a vendor then buyer. Just my opinion, also never had a newer buyer refuse to FE, they know they need to walk before they can run.
