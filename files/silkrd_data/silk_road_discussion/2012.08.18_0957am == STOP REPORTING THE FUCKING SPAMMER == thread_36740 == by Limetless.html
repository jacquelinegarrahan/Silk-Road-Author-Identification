				I know they are there and I am not blind, I am dealing with it as and when I have time. Baring in mind I have been dealing with this all night I realize they have not fucked off. <br /><br />I have spoke to someone who is trying to get their site DDOSed so give it time. There is no point deleting their posts and banning their account because they just come back. <br /><br />STOP FUCKING REPORTING IT.

				Limitless is correct. A few months ago, it was usually just kids or idiots that wanted to cause trouble.. So, I would either just ignore them, warn them or try to fight them.. While fighting seemed to work very little, ignoring them and warning them seemed to be the only thing to fight it. If you fight it, all you will get is carpel tunnel syndrome...I killed them with kindness, and that actually worked a lot.. Like asking them very nicely to stop..I know it sounds weird, but it worked...

				I would suggest banning on *mtgix* positive.<br /><br />Using &quot;banned words&quot; or some SMF alternative would be first idea, that comes into my mind.<br /><br />Edit: Yup. SMF 1.x it would be admin-&gt;Forum:Messages and topics-&gt;Banned words. Censure might be bad idea, but I am sure that nobody will need prozac if he couldn&#039;t write message that contains &quot;mtgix&quot;. Would actually bet my left hand.<br /><br />Edit II: I stand corrected. It just replaces banned word. On another hand - http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1876 (clear web!) mod might give ideas and pointers.

				Oh don&#039;t worry about it, you only have newbies left and right giving these idiots money... <br /><br />I tried and put a &quot;SPAM&quot; reply in all of their threads.<br /><br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t be able to make a thread until you have 20 posts or someshit..<br /><br /><br />This whole forum is going to shit.. it takes 24hours+ to remove a few spammers?
