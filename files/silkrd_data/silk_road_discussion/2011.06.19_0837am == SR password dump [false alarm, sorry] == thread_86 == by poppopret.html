				HOLY FUCK! I think it&#039;s true. SR was down for a while untill yesterdar and it started working again and I logged in to take care of stuff (the outtages have been a huge fuck over for me) then all of a sudden I was logged out. I tried logging back in but it wasn&#039;t working. I posted on iselldrugs2u and someone pointed me to this site. Fuck. These motherfuckers hacked my acc!

				well its not hard to grab a list of all usernames because the ids of the user accounts are not obfuscated, but instead it&#039;s an increasing integer.<br /><br />meaning you could write a simple script going from<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1<br />to<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/10000<br />getting the string between &lt;h2&gt;(.+?)&lt;/h2&gt;<br /><br />and voila you got a list of usernames.<br />as SR stated, there have been bruteforce attacks on the site, so maybe that&#039;s where a few of those passwords are from.<br /><br />but I don&#039;t believe they have actual dumps of the db. as cleartext passwords in there would be pretty pretty stupid ...

				The second line in the post tells you that its the user list from BlackMarket.&nbsp; Yes some of the users are the same and some of them have used the same passwords.&nbsp; But the user backopy who runs BlackMarket appeared to have some sort of falling out with SR people recently.

				That&#039;s slander!<br />They could do the same with SR or any other site, just grab the user list and put something in front pretending to be that user password.<br />Don&#039;t listen to rumors of this kind.

				The site has real time monitors showing me who is in it, last listings, last transactions, etc.<br />None of the users in that list are online. The only passwords that probably match, I don&#039;t know because they&#039;re stored ripemd160 hashed, are the ones created by the guy who published that list.<br /><br />It just gave me a few more lines like this:<br /><br />[2011-06-19 11:10:13] LOGIN ERROR Wrong user or password! swish<br /><br />in the site&#039;s security log.

				Sure, but he didn&#039;t published short passwords nor I&#039;m up to crack them; if I want to know that I would simply hook the login form or store it in plain text.<br />Also if he had access to the database with coins there, he would go to the passwords?! Or to change balance from others to his account?

				@Checkov<br /><br />That&#039;s not even your &quot;impostor&quot; password, ripemd160 of that pwd is e1d01e499d6fbb730bfbf397d70dd41547163d3d<br />not even close to what is in the db.<br />If you want me to input his feedback line of not being you PM me by old SR, PM&#039;s or entries here aren&#039;t accepted for a simple reason; here you can be the same Chekov from SR... or not.
