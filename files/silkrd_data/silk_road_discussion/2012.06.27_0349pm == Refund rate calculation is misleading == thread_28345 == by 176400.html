				Been on the road now for 11 months, just buy a wee smoke every month or two nothing major.&nbsp; Had my first problem the other day, package never turned up but the vendor admitted they were at fault and I got 100% refund.&nbsp; All good.<br /><br />However, now my refund rate says 42.21%&nbsp; &nbsp;wtf!?&nbsp; I had 16 transactions for ~150btc.&nbsp; I get 1 refund for 8btc and it says that!&nbsp; I messaged admin, but they said its based on how recent the transaction is and the amount, so maybe its because I haven&#039;t bought for a couple of months?<br /><br />Going to be tough to get escrow now, I was proud of my perfect stats and now they are forked.&nbsp; Feel like making a new account and starting over :(<br /><br />I think this should be changed.&nbsp; Anyone else have a similar experience?<br />

				It counts recent refunds with more weight than older refunds.&nbsp; it will go down on its own if you simply wait.&nbsp; Obviously, completing more transactions will reduce the rate, but so will time.&nbsp; Eventually, it will go back to 0.00%.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s this way because scammers can complete a bunch of transactions, and then *start* to scam vendors, so they want to flag them early?<br /><br />But yea, what ether said--explain it and be polite if it presents an issue with a vendor.

				Was about to start a thread on this when I checked my stats,<br />I&#039;ve got an average of ~100 buys and ~40,000 average USD spent on SR. Member for 9 months, 1 refund during my first month from a dumbass who couldn&#039;t ship ONE TAB of LSD, second one being Mister Dank but I don&#039;t even want to explain that, you guys all know our celebrities .&nbsp; and yet my refund rate is 13.25%&nbsp; If I were a vendor and I looked at my stats I would think out of 100 packs 13.25 of them get &#039;lost&#039; / intercepted / or just scamming the vendor.&nbsp; but whatever, I understand now that recent refunds carry more weight.&nbsp; This makes sense.
