				Hey. Like it says. I miscalculated the fee&#039;s and shipping cost so I am .19 btc away from making my first purchase on SR. Can someone loan me .19BTC and I&#039;ll pay them back next time I buy bitcoins?

				Your best bet is to put 3 BTC on SatoshiDice on the 91% bet, then you will get 3.21 BTC return if you win.<br />Or nothing if you loose, but it is 91%&nbsp; of winning ;)

				Hey everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m still getting used to this &quot;dark net&quot; thing and completely forgot about these forums and this post.<br /><br />Thanks for all of those who replied with an offer to help! I went ahead and loaded up on a few more BTC since I&#039;ll be making another purchase in the next few weeks.<br /><br />Yes, my first post after creating an account was me asking to borrow a few BTC for my first purchase. That&#039;s probably because it was my first purchase and I had not yet needed to make an account.<br /><br />It seems like most everyone here is willing to help, so I&#039;ll be back with more stupid questions in the future.<br /><br />Thanks again and safe travels!

				You&#039;ve prolly already heard that no question is stupid.<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of true. :P<br /><br />You haven&#039;t done anything stupid, it&#039;s just suspicious when the first post is asking for BTC to makeup for a short transaction. To most people, it might look like a throwaway account made just to bum BTC.
