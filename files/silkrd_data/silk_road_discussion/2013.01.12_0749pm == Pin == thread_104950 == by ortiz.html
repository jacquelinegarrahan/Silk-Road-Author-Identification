				First of all I want to say hello, just arrived here :) My purpose here is primarily weed for medical reasons.<br /><br />I don´t know if this has come up in other posts in here but I had some pin difficulties, and only after I asked a vendor in here I new for sure what I had to do.<br /><br />I don´t know if alot of noobs like myself have this problem but why doesn´t it say when you register and you get your pin, that it is important to save the Pin as you have to use it again when you want to buy things in here? If it said to me that the Pin upon registration is important as I have to use it again I would have saved it on my computer so I didn´t have this problem that I have now, where I have tried different ones because I was in doubt of which one it was meant to use to make a purchase.<br /><br />Don´t know for sure but I can imagine that others also have this problem and now I was told I have to wait for about 5 days:(<br />I wrote support some hours ago but still no answer and I only have 1 attempt left and if I use that and still wrong I don´t know what happens, so it would be alot easier if I knew that first pin was important. So maybe you can give new members a heads up on registration so this doesn´t happen all the time?<br /><br />Anyway nice site with alot of different stuff<br /><br />best regards

				Did you think when you were asked to pick a PIN they were just testing your ability to choose a string of numbers?&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Did the text underneath the PIN entry box that says <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">DO NOT forget your PIN!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> not give you a clue?<br /><br />Do they need to have your computer smack you in the face as you read that to make sure you see the warning?&nbsp; What else would you like them to do?<br /><br />I don&#039;t quite understand your complaint.

				Actually I didn´t notice it said don´t forget your pin, still I think there could be some way to retrieve it like if u forgot ur password then usually sites can mail it to you. I understand the securty stuff here but could be nice if there was some way to get a new one.<br />To me it is a bit confusing with all these pin numbers from bitcoins and another for sr when ur not used to it. Either that or I put in the right pin and the site didn´t respond to it as being right.<br />It is not a big complaint, I just wish there was an easier way to do it as I´m not the only one having this problem.<br />So instead of mocking my post why don´t u use ur time on coming up with a better solution then!<br />

				I don&#039;t think we need a better solution.<br /><br />The whole point of having the PIN separate from the password and not immediately recoverable is for security.<br /><br />If a user on SR is too inept to write down his PIN when creating his account then I don&#039;t want to know what other sort of stuff they won&#039;t do properly for protecting their identity and that of the sellers.&nbsp; What other guidelines will you choose to not read or simply ignore?<br /><br />You came on here whining about SR not warning you to remember your PIN when you register and that is ridiculous when the ONLY text on the entire registration page that doesn&#039;t define what the input fields are for is doing EXACTLY THAT.<br /><br />

If you need to have explained to you the importance of knowing your pin number, your motherfucking retarded. Period.<br /><br />Do you have a bank account? When you opened your bank account did you right down the pin number? Wouldn&#039;t you think that a pin number on another site had the exact same importance? Honestly, how do people even manage to navigate here if they can&#039;t read. Must be some conspiracy to stupid us to death, since LEO can&#039;t catch us<br /><br />
