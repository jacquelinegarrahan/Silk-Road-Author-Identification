				Y&#039;all are quick!&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t even spend time scratching my head to figure out a problem.&nbsp; Just log onto the forum &amp; see what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; I noticed it was down and spent about 10 mins worrying about it then i found this thread.&nbsp; You said it was up &amp; you were right.

				JEZUZ,<br /><br />I hope you tried to fix that usb stick.&nbsp; Its not that hard.&nbsp; The flash memory chips are still intact on it.&nbsp; You could re-solder the chipboard together among other options.&nbsp; If the bitcoins on it were substantial, I would try to bring it to a electronics shop and pay them to salvage the memory chip on the broken usb stick.<br /><br />I say this because it happened to me and I was able to re=solder the stick back together for a short time to get the files off it.&nbsp; It was taped together and solder globs hanging off it&nbsp; lol...<br /><br />take care.<br />
