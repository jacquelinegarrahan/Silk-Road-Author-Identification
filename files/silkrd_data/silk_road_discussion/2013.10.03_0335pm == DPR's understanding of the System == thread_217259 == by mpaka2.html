				Gentlemen,<br /><br />I should first and foremost mention that we don&#039;t know exactly what&#039;s happening yet. The fact that this forum is still up and the oddities in the takedown notice image suggests something fishy that we are missing. The image has the SR camel logo as a watermark, and it says &quot;this HIDDEN site has been seized&quot;... a bored graphics guy at a NYC FBI desk? Or something else entirely? The agency logos in the image seem to be valid after a quick comparison, but if there is a single anomaly, then the image is not from the FBI. In any case, something big HAS happened.<br /><br />DPR is apparently accused of &quot;narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, soliciting murder, and money laundering conspiracy&quot;, all of which (except the 3rd) are victim-less &quot;crimes,&quot; ie not crimes at all but rather violations of legislation, ie the ignoring of nonsensical ideas written on paper by self-serving men in suits. The 3rd charge, soliciting murder, should be regarded as a fabrication, obviously. But even if this charge were true, the person who was to be murdered would have been served karmic justice (what kind of scumbag lowlife threatens to disclose the names and addresses of thousands of SR users as a blackmail method?).<br /><br />All of this criminal behavior (the FBI goons, the blackmailing cracker, DPR&#039;s alleged dealing with a hit man, and the murder for hire business) stems from the enforced commerce/profit motive.<br /><br />DPR read his way towards truth... The Austrian school of economics, Libertarianism, crypto-anarchism, ... the last step in this path is understanding the existing system that dictates and controls behavior, how it really operates at its core, clearing away the layers of abstraction. Some very clear-thinking individuals have been paving the way to help humanity evolve beyond the control matrix. I believe DPR was well on his way to reaching this level of understanding.<br /><br />The idea that someone would BELIEVE that they have the right -- the &quot;authority&quot; -- to dictate what you can or cannot put into your own body is completely preposterous to anyone but the most mindless robot.<br /><br />To anyone who is thinking I&#039;m &quot;going too far,&quot; I challenge you to watch the following videos:<br /><br />The Complete and Undeniable Truth - Larken Rose (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mZ5FBHg0A)&nbsp; [more from Larken Rose... if you can handle it! (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=larken+rose)]<br /><br />The &quot;ruling class,&quot; the &quot;authorities,&quot; didn&#039;t just pop out of nowhere...<br /><br />The Story of Your Enslavement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbp6umQT58A)&nbsp; [more from Stefan Molyneux (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stefan+molyneux)]<br /><br />Max Igan (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Max+Igan) is another enlightened individual who explains the system in great detail and clarity.<br /><br />The state represents control, oppression, power, ego-behavior... It does not represent any of the things we are taught to believe from the moment we are born. The younger one is when stumbling upon this kind of information, the less cognitive dissonance one will experience. DPR/Ulbricht is, reportedly, only 29.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: BBC</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The court documents described Mr Ulbricht, 29, as a former physics student at the University of Texas, who had gone on to study at the University of Pennsylvania between 2006 and 2010.<br /><br />It was here, according to Mr Ulbricht&#039;s LinkedIn profile, as quoted by court documents, that his &quot;&#039;goals&#039; subsequently &#039;shifted&#039;&quot;.<br /><br />He wrote on the social network that he had wanted to &quot;give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force&quot; by &quot;institutions and governments&quot;.<br /><br />Authorities said he took to online forums to publicise Silk Road as a potential marketplace for drugs back in January 2011.<br /><br />In one such message, a user believed to be Mr Ulbricht allegedly said: &quot;Has anyone seen Silk Road yet? It&#039;s kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />DPR&#039;s understanding was reaching this point (as briefly outlined in the videos above), if it wasn&#039;t there already. There was a solid philosophical understanding underlying this SR operation. Whatever direction we go from here, it should be rooted in the same kind of true understanding, free from illusions. We should seek to understand how reality works, what life is, and what this pathological system of control that we live under really is. This may be the end of a legend, but DPR&#039;s legacy lives on within each and every one of us who benefited from his deeds.<br /><br />As Libertas put it (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216836.0):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dread Pirate Roberts - as a persona - has singlehandedly kept world governments at bay for two and a half years. This idea that this one entity can successfully thwart the phenomenal resources and bloodthirsty power of numerous governments for so long is something that should be taken to heart, and never forgotten. We have the power to fight these agents of oppression, to fight the governments that task them with that oppression, and with the fires that Silk Road has stoked in our hearts and minds we must do just that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />SR was a project built on Bitcoin. The power of Bitcoin lies in its decentralized nature. We need to understand why this idea takes the control away from the central banks, which are at the top of the control system. Most of the population has absolutely no clue as to how money is created or who sets economic policy.<br /><br />Zeitgeist Addendum (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EewGMBOB4Gg) beautifully explains how it works<br /><br />Remember that, originally, there was evil intent behind the technologies we are using. It was the system itself, through military research projects, who gave us the Internet, public key cryptography, and Tor. Building on that we have achieved economic decentralization (Bitcoin), and building on that, the very first international True Free Market Economy (Silk Road).<br /><br />Quoting Libertas again:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To the members of Law Enforcement that are no doubt reading this, many of you may have received pats on the back and &quot;high-fives&quot; from your peers. You may feel good now, ecstatic even, but I urge you to consider the effects of your actions. You are going to see more bloodshed on our streets (note &quot;our&quot;, not &quot;your&quot;, for those streets belong to the people), and more dealer on buyer violence as free people that wish to engage in activities that harm none are forced to return to their previous methods of securing the goods that they wish to put into their own bodies. That blood is now on your hands, and the hands of the politicians that you live to serve and serve to live. I pity you, for as long as you live to serve you will never know freedom.<br /><br />To the community at large, you have been nothing short of incredible. Keep fighting the good fight, and never let they who are bound by the chains of law tell you that you are not permitted to be free simply because they are shackled themselves. Governments tells us that we are free but the reality is that the moment we are born we are shackled by the rule of law. Government has no place in a free society, and we need to make sure that they who deem it their right to take away the natural rights of others as free beings are made fully aware of that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We have to quit referring to them by their terms. Calling them &quot;LE&quot; (&quot;Law Enforcement&quot;) is a ridiculous compromise. It was through strict &quot;law enforcement&quot; that Stalin starved some 10 million Ukrainian farmers to death, forcing them into cannibalistic behavior. Control freaks, agents of control, authority zombies, believers in authority, are but a few more accurate terms we can use.<br /><br />The criminals from the government who BELIEVE they have &quot;authority&quot; are stealing from all of us (see videos above). In this case they have stolen specifically from all SR users, so let us come together as a community and show these deluded fools that this little &quot;victory&quot; of theirs simply marks the end of the 1st generation of True Free Market Economics, and that in no time we will be up and running again, whether as Silk Road Reloaded, BMR, Sheep, or under any other name.<br /><br />Folks, I bet that within a month we&#039;ll be back to where we were. We can use the symbolic date of the 5th of November to evaluate how much &quot;damage&quot; they actually did, how much of a &quot;victory&quot; it really was.<br /><br />Like the 5th of November,<br /><br />Remember, remember, the 2nd of October.<br /><br />Inlakesh<br />

There was a solid philosophical understanding underlying this SR operation. Whatever direction we go from here, it should be rooted in the same kind of true understanding, free from illusions. We should seek to understand how reality works, what life is, and what this pathological system of control that we live under really is. This may be the end of a legend, but DPR&#039;s legacy lives on within each and every one of us who benefited from his deeds.<br /><br />As Libertas put it (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216836.0):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Dread Pirate Roberts - as a persona - has singlehandedly kept world governments at bay for two and a half years. This idea that this one entity can successfully thwart the phenomenal resources and bloodthirsty power of numerous governments for so long is something that should be taken to heart, and never forgotten. We have the power to fight these agents of oppression, to fight the governments that task them with that oppression, and with the fires that Silk Road has stoked in our hearts and minds we must do just that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />SR was a project built on Bitcoin. The power of Bitcoin lies in its decentralized nature. We need to understand why this idea takes the control away from the central banks, which are at the top of the control system. Most of the population has absolutely no clue as to how money is created or who sets economic policy.<br /><br />Zeitgeist Addendum (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EewGMBOB4Gg) beautifully explains how it works<br /><br />Remember that, originally, there was evil intent behind the technologies we are using. It was the system itself, through military research projects, who gave us the Internet, public key cryptography, and Tor. Building on that we have achieved economic decentralization (Bitcoin), and building on that, the very first international True Free Market Economy (Silk Road).<br /><br />Quoting Libertas again:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">To the members of Law Enforcement that are no doubt reading this, many of you may have received pats on the back and &quot;high-fives&quot; from your peers. You may feel good now, ecstatic even, but I urge you to consider the effects of your actions. You are going to see more bloodshed on our streets (note &quot;our&quot;, not &quot;your&quot;, for those streets belong to the people), and more dealer on buyer violence as free people that wish to engage in activities that harm none are forced to return to their previous methods of securing the goods that they wish to put into their own bodies. That blood is now on your hands, and the hands of the politicians that you live to serve and serve to live. I pity you, for as long as you live to serve you will never know freedom.<br /><br />To the community at large, you have been nothing short of incredible. Keep fighting the good fight, and never let they who are bound by the chains of law tell you that you are not permitted to be free simply because they are shackled themselves. Governments tells us that we are free but the reality is that the moment we are born we are shackled by the rule of law. Government has no place in a free society, and we need to make sure that they who deem it their right to take away the natural rights of others as free beings are made fully aware of that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We have to quit referring to them by their terms. Calling them &quot;LE&quot; (&quot;Law Enforcement&quot;) is a ridiculous compromise. It was through strict &quot;law enforcement&quot; that Stalin starved some 10 million Ukrainian farmers to death, forcing them into cannibalistic behavior. Control freaks, agents of control, authority zombies, believers in authority, are but a few more accurate terms we can use.<br /><br />The criminals from the government who BELIEVE they have &quot;authority&quot; are stealing from all of us (see videos above). In this case they have stolen specifically from all SR users, so let us come together as a community and show these deluded fools that this little &quot;victory&quot; of theirs simply marks the end of the 1st generation of True Free Market Economics, and that in no time we will be up and running again, whether as Silk Road Reloaded, BMR, Sheep, or under any other name.<br /><br />Folks, I bet that within a month we&#039;ll be back to where we were. We can use the symbolic date of the 5th of November to evaluate how much &quot;damage&quot; they actually did, how much of a &quot;victory&quot; it really was.<br /><br />Like the 5th of November,<br /><br />Remember, remember, the 2nd of October.<br /><br />Inlakesh<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />lol hippies are dumb.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and self important.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and idealistic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and naive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />but written great
