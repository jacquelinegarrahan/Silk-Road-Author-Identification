				Hello, I purchased some goods from a vendor, and left feedback; of course. However, when viewing the vendor&#039;s profile, my feedback is not there. Also, someone else had left feedback, noting that the pack they received stunk to high heaven, which deeply concerned me, of course. However, my feedback is nowhere to be found, neither is the other buyer&#039;s. What gives?? I see feedback as one of the main sources of info on a vendor that ultimately helps me decide if I should purchase from them or not.

But I read the other buyers&#039; feedback after the item was no longer listed, so who knows. Anyhow, I don&#039;t particularly like the situation in general, who knows what vendors possibly have feedback that would influence your decision one way or the other; But you will never know because it&#039;s not there. I can understand if it&#039;s really old, but in my opinion, recent feedback should be visible, regardless.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
