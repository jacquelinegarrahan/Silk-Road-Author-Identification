				Posted this on the BMR forum SR discussion page as well. Vote there if you prefer: http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewtopic.php?id=7545<br /><br />Just curious how much everyone lost? My heart goes out to vendors that had lots of BTC in escrow. Now I&#039;m wishing I&#039;d FE&#039;d on everything cause it&#039;s not like I&#039;m getting that money back either and my orders are still in transit as far as I know. I only had about $30 BTC in my account but it still sucks to lose anything. Here&#039;s hoping the vendors actually shipped when they said they did and I&#039;ll still get my orders. I had at least one that was still processing, guess that&#039;s gone.<br /><br />Much love goes out to my SR family. Good to see we have a home at BMR after being displaced from our beloved SR! Let this be a lesson learned, all of us should let it be motivation to hike up our security and/or lay low for awhile if needed. I for one plan to scope out BMR for awhile before (or even if ever) ordering anything. Particularly since they sell guns on this site, I&#039;m willing to bet this one will be the next to go. Be careful, it&#039;s a jungle out there! &lt;3

				Luckily for me I only lost $10. However, lets not forget, that we ALL lost probably the only TRUE FREE MARKET in modern day, A market completely untouched my governments filthy, greedy paws. Until now. Fucking scumbags.... People are being rape, robbed and murdered as we speak, and this is what they decide to pursue, harmless drug users, committing victimless crimes....&nbsp;

				I didn&#039;t lose shit compared to some of the vendors, and my sympathies go out to them. <br /><br />IF any of my TRUSTED vendors move markets, I am 100% okay finalizing early through them, as I know they took a major hit. If they decide to screw me, then so be it, but those guys lost upwards of tens of thousands of dollars in the snap of a finger And with my previous dealing with them, I trust them as much as you can an anonymous person you have never met oon the opposite side of the country. <br /><br />Regardless of how this plays out, on the other markets, my plan is to stay loyal to SR vendors only.

				I feel bad for anyone who lost anything but I believe there&#039;s a bigger picture here.<br /><br />The only real losers here are those who have lost or may still lose their freedom in order to facilitate this paradise we knew as Silk Road. Money comes and goes, true freedom rarely does.&nbsp; Because of DPR &amp; SR we were able to taste that. Although you may have lost what you had the only reason you had at all was because of DPR &amp; SR. It&#039;s unfortunate for everyone involved but if you choose to cry about your personal losses while the whole community has been affected you didn&#039;t belong here to begin with. Do us all a favor and please don&#039;t follow us to the reincarnation, whenever or wherever it may be.
