				I am a one month member with good stats and several successful purchases...several vendors have rejected small orders outright because I am new...one even suggested he would never do business with me...I guess for the crime of being new...am I missing something or is there some vendor right of passage I must pass in my pursuit of innocent recreation...if all vendors have access to is my stats then I can imagine why they wouldn&#039;t want a good customer, one month, three months or a year old...thanks to the vendors who did sell when I was brand as new...

				Without knowing the exact nature of your communications with these vendors I will just say this: The vendor should always have the right to refuse to deal with buyers for any reason they choose, but if they&#039;re going to be an ass-hat about it they&#039;re probably not a vendor you want to be dealing with anyway.<br /><br />I go out of my way as a buyer to be as courteous and pleasant with vendors as a would a shop keeper IRL, and so far all vendors I&#039;ve dealt with have been more than helpful with their communications and customer service. If everyone tries their best to do the same I don&#039;t see why most SR transactions can&#039;t be as smooth as buying lunch...
