				I watched a video documentary about Anonymous and they have some sort of program available out there that you use called the low orbit ion cannon, which is named after the &quot;game ender&quot; weapons in the Command and Conquer series. Some guy was arrested it for using it to refresh a page on a credit card site about 700,000 times in a couple of days. I&#039;ll look in to it.

				As someone said in the past this is what starts those lame ddos wars that go on for long after anyone can remember what started it. If you really want to you can rent a botnet off people on darkweb, its better than using apps from your own PC. However that will disrupt the site momentarily. and will cause an influx of more spam, to them its a game, nothing more. Retaliation would really be trying to pinpoint a physical location of the server hosting it. or at least an ISP, with that you can do much more damage. <br />ACE

				I think the best thing we can do is let the admins delete all the spam and halt the account it&#039;s coming from. Like someone else said, this is just a game to them. It&#039;s probably just some punk ass teenager. It may take awhile, but they will leave sooner or later when they get bored. I don&#039;t think many people would fall for it cus it&#039;s a pretty blatant scam, but a few probably do, and that&#039;s enough for them. There should be sticky in all forums in caps saying do not open btkoin spam message and should explain exactly what they are trying to do.<br /><br />Some may argue that if you are dumb enough to fall for it you deserve it. Even if that&#039;s correct the less people fall for the scam or even read them, the sooner they will leave.<br /><br />In other words: don&#039;t feed the trolls/spammers!

				It&#039;s probably some sort of bot. You won&#039;t receive a PM if you change your profile to disallow users to see you online. If it isn&#039;t a bot it is one, lone, disciplined Chinaman who makes a few scams a day trolling multiple forums.

				I&#039;m like a Silk Road hipster. &quot;I was here BEFORE the spam, man&quot;. I remember when that shit was called Mt. Gix and a few people fell for it, but it&#039;s become an attack at this point.

				I never thought I&#039;d say this but it would be cool if SR bought back assassinations so someone could end this piece of shit&#039;s miserable existence. LOL...spammer assassination fund...I would donate.
