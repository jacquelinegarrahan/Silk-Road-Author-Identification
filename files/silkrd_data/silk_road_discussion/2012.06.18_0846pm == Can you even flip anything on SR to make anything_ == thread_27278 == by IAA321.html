				Seems as if everything on here is street price except weed. Everything else seems to be more or equal to street price. Is there anything on SR you could flip though?

				Would depend on your street if SR is street prices for weed, my experience so far is most of the weed is incredibly overpriced and the rest isn&#039;t good enough quality for the price anyways.<br /><br />MDMA and psychedelics are some you could turn a buck on, since finding legit pure MDMA is difficult and at least in my area the price for shrooms are much higher than they are on SR, and half the quality of Rocker&#039;s or USAShroomz. I haven&#039;t had legit local LSD outside of festival dealers in years, and no ones even heard of 25i nbome which is a really inexpensive trip compared to anything else.

				The answer, of course, is that youcan make anything by flipping anything on SR.<br /><br />The answer I can&#039;t give you is if you&#039;re competent enough to source the substances and price them in such a way that you profit while still hooking people up.<br /><br />^this <br />Is how you make money on SR, the main thing is your connect, from there it&#039;s all easy as pie...assuming you have half decent gear.

				Considering the prices on here for bulk listings, I&#039;d be able to flip them for at least $1000 profit selling at tours and festivals nearby. Fucking best part of living in the mountains is street price is high. Easiest things to make a profit on are MDMA, mushies , and definitely LSD for me. ^-^

				Yeah, mdma is the best way. Buy like 50-100 grams–pay no more than 30/g– sell at 100. You can get better stuff than anything I&#039;ve encountered on the street. Mix premium capsules with 20% 2C-B or ketamine. Get creative.

				Pills are generally quite cheap on SR, though the fall of disappearance of Made In Holland and adam93&#039;s cheap pills has been rather annoying.

				I live in a large city. Xanax bars street price here are 3-5$ Per 2mg bar. The mdma is what I&#039;m interested in aswell for capping it cutting a bit then selling . Example of our prices where I live at : Weed 15-20$ / G , Coke 50/g , Vikadins $3 on average&nbsp; , E tends to be 10-15$ Per pill&nbsp; Oxy&#039;s are 4-5$

				XTC is your best bet (check PF out). Personally I don&#039;t use SR as a gateway for selling but stick to personal use. To each is own though. :)
