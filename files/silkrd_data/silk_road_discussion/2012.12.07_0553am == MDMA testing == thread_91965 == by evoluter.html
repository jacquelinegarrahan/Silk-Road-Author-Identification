				Hey all<br /><br />A friend of mine recently purchased some MDMA from an Australian vendor who appears legit. We haven&#039;t had an opp to try it yet but he has tested it with the Mandelin test and not being experts on such things are finding it hard to judge the results (The coloured drop produced is a dark, nearly black I&#039;m convincing myself:) circle but there&#039;s bleeding round the edge that&#039;s somewhere between pink and orange) Anyone cluey care to offer an opinion? And as to how reliable testing like this is?<br /><br />(attempted to upload an image here (small, like 34kb) but doesn&#039;t seem to want to do it. Should it be poss? Obviously without a pic this question&#039;s a bit stupid lol)<br /><br />If the stuff&#039;s good we want to get some more for the silly season - and if not might try another option.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				And while I&#039;m at it does anyone have experience with vendors AussieExpress and EnterThe Matrix for MDMA? Any recommends/preferences?

				So let me get this straight. You can buy less than 2g for the same amount that Frank Mathews will do you 25g PURE PMK based MDMA and you&#039;re still willing to buy their rubbish?<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but that would be about the silliest thing you could do in this situation.<br /><br />$175 with Frank will get you 10g which is less than they charge for one of not even the same quality<br /><br />and he will get it to you, I can assure you of that!<br /><br />If you can&#039;t find someone to take the drop, or yourself using an alias, find a vacant house for sale in your area and use the letter box. Domain.com.au is your friend here ;-)<br /><br />Be smart, SR is here to save you money, not waste it on overpriced thieves!

				Guess I have lots to learn being new here ;)<br /><br />ETM and AExp prices seem in line with what I might pay for COMPLETE rubbish from random connections in the real world (I&#039;d given up on ever having the &quot;real thing&quot; again so it seems like a minor (possibly even a major) miracle to be able to access anything even remotely good.<br /><br />Who/what is Frank Mathews?

				You can always perform an acetone wash over your dirty MDMA to remove impurities. See: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45508.0
