				I had a sample order from Poseidon from the customer appreciation sale that never got delivered (or sent I think).ar<br /><br />He made a post in the Rumor Mill section explaining what had happened and why so many orders had not gone out (whether or not you believe his explanation is sort of irrelevant I think).<br /><br />In any case, he made a promise to come back and fulfill all of his missed orders. I&#039;m not sure I see the harm in letting him be active again. No one will (or should) order from him until he fulfills those orders, and if and when he does, we&#039;ll know he&#039;s okay to order from again.<br /><br />The guy had a positive rep before this. Some of you seem to forget that this is shady business we&#039;re dealing with and these are all real people that have to deal with real problems. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying you need to give him the benefit of the doubt, but there&#039;s no need to be so venomous and unyielding towards him if he&#039;s willing to make things right.

				I had a order that was marked as sent the first couple of days of Feb and then last night cancelled which was 3 weeks after the fact.&nbsp; Either do business right or fuck off.&nbsp; I was fucked over on my first two orders on SR (not Poseidon) so I have no patience for unprofessional bullshit and scammers.&nbsp; Either do what you say you&#039;re gonna do or go fuck yourself.&nbsp; &nbsp;
