AS for tormail.com, that&#039;s been gone for like a year and a half. They switched to .org addresses when their servers were seized in Russia. And tormail.com was never the real site; it may or may not (not sure because I never tried to access it that way) have been a gateway to it, but the login was a .onion site

				I&#039;m with ye on this one too guys....<br /><br />I&#039;ve only seen online articles stating about DPR but not once have I seen it on any news program on the tv.??<br /><br />Surely it&#039;d be number 1 headline for any news station???<br /><br />Just something not right indeed and i&#039;d like to hope that it is the case that the feds haven&#039;t a hold of it at all and there is some other possible explanation. Wishful thinking I know but it&#039;s not impossible.

It looks like a watermark on the seized page. That is definitely a little strange. Why would the Feds create a custom seizure page for SR complete with the logo as a watermark.

				We&#039;ll probably get a lot of conspiracy stories... and it&#039;ll take a long time to clear things up if that happens at all. <br /><br />The DPR arrest story sounds plausible, but then again, lets first wait and see what happens to the money in escrow and in our wallets. The 26000 BTC seized are nothing compared to what was there, and it will turn up somewhere eventually if we do not get it back. <br /><br />There was a panic sale for a bit, but it seems to have hit bottom at &gt; us$100 for now. <br /><br />One possible scenario is that the btc in escrow and wallets will actually end up in limbo: in a wallet, on a server, that has been uplugged and cannot be restarted because its file system is encrypted and noone knows/provides the password for. <br /><br />If government actually took the escrow, they will have a hard time selling it for dollars - it would cause a drop more severe than what we have seen today, there might be (half) a million BTC tangled up in here, and that cannot be sold off without markets taking serious notice of the sheer volume. <br />

I&#039;m no expert obviously but there&#039;s endless possibilities of what is going to happen at this early stage.

The timing seems suspiciously close to the FH/tormail debacle. <br /><br />BTW, am I the first person to notice that your username is a character from the Dune series; a business man who made his money harvesting chemicals and drugs from plants and the first to commercialise Spice!

				you cant tell me DPR was that ignorant to make the simple mistakes he made. posting his name in public forums, murder for hire? (total bullshit how would a SR user be able to expose n e one?? i mean isnt everyones address destroyed and isnt everything supposed to be encrypted), using public wifi in an internet cafe 500 ft from his house?!? Its almost impossible to believe he did this with SR being founded on anonymity and how much we pride ourselves and stress on how much we need to stay anonymous. He didnt use TAILS? he made a fucking twitter account?!?!? THEY CANNOT BE TALKING ABOUT THE FOUNDER OF THIS FUCKING COMMUNITY?!?!?....i mean at the end of the day hes still innocent until proven guilty and he hasnt been charged with ne thing. <br /><br />Y no mugshot or footage?? this shit is epic i mean come on with everything going on the news would be milking the shit out of this, ive only seen shit on the web like someone stated earlier in the post. I honestly am not buying this bullshit and i refuse to believe n e thing i see in the news, i advise u guys to do the same. <br /><br />but yes i hope the forums stay up and we can stay a community united. ill be around as long as there up !

				Yes, the link is floating around to the 30-40 page pdf of the warrant request outlining all of the FACTS. Please everyone READ IT. LE might not be too quick to put up a mugshot as they might be rubber hosing him in a back room for a few days. His bail hearing or arraignment I think you call it is on Friday. Then you will see it.<br /><br />From another thread;<br /><br />Want to say that the camel in background is less questionable to us then the seizure notice in the 1st place.<br /><br />There is NOTHING to seize, it is not a domain, it is a cryptographic function. You can&#039;t seize it. &quot;Hidden Site&quot; ?<br /><br />Many things can be wrong here, we agree but try not to spread FUD. <br /><br />BUT - there is someone arrested and LE believes that person is DPR and the site is down. These are FACTS and there is no hoax.<br /><br />IF the arrest happen as said at 3:15pm PST on 10/1, and there was a dead man switch of sorts or it took awhile for others to find out and enact shutdown procedures that could explain the odd notice. These things are really not relevant right now and only spread Uncertainty and Doubt.<br /><br />There is also very little doubt in our minds that on July 23rd LE DID get a live image of the running SR web server.<br /><br />So whether the seizure notice is real or part of a shutdown plan don matter much right now. LE did get an image at one point and that is a TREASURE trove of information. And there IS a person under arrest that LE strongly believes is DPR.<br /><br />Throwing around conspiracy theories and focusing on the seizure notice is not helpful right now. Maybe it&#039;s best not to look to deeply into it right now.....

				The fall of Silk Road isn&#039;t mentioned anywhere in my country&#039;s news. How other media and press were able to get information this fast? <br /><br />Any way, regardless that this community is mostly on the other side of the law, i saw lot of humanity with everyone sharing advices and lending money to those who needed it. And even vendors gave legit advices and didn&#039;t push people to buy their products. It&#039;s hard to see any criminals here. <br />But i personally keep low profile for now and see how things go. Whether it&#039;s LE or someone else.

				Its is all over the press for instance in uk bbc news<br /><br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24373759<br /><br />It could be a way of forcing vendors to another black market sight , for FBI intelligence purposes ?<br /><br /><br /><br />

(total bullshit how would a SR user be able to expose n e one?? i mean isnt everyones address destroyed and isnt everything supposed to be encrypted), using public wifi in an internet cafe 500 ft from his house?!? Its almost impossible to believe he did this with SR being founded on anonymity and how much we pride ourselves and stress on how much we need to stay anonymous. He didnt use TAILS? he made a fucking twitter account?!?!? THEY CANNOT BE TALKING ABOUT THE FOUNDER OF THIS FUCKING COMMUNITY?!?!?....i mean at the end of the day hes still innocent until proven guilty and he hasnt been charged with ne thing. <br /><br />Y no mugshot or footage?? this shit is epic i mean come on with everything going on the news would be milking the shit out of this, ive only seen shit on the web like someone stated earlier in the post. I honestly am not buying this bullshit and i refuse to believe n e thing i see in the news, i advise u guys to do the same. <br /><br />but yes i hope the forums stay up and we can stay a community united. ill be around as long as there up !<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Everyone who ran SR , and yes it&#039;s just not one guy, are very very very very rich in the 2 1/2 years of operation. They ran into the same problem the cartel&#039;s have. Where to put all the cash. And it damn sure isn&#039;t in Bitcoin. SR is a procurement cartel pure and simple. These guys have more currency than they know what to do with, they simply retired. They got what was left in my account.<br />I don&#039;t buy the LE aspect of this, they just shut thier doors as planned. Regardless the reason, I &#039;m glad I was a customer, now on to the next site that has the goods.<br /><br />Bikerbum

				nah they are not going to reveal how they got him. it&#039;s like doing an illegal wiretap and then &quot;discovering&quot; something else to justify a warrant or something.
