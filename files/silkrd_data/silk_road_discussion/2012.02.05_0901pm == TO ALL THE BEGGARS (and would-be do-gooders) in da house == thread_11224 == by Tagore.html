				~THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH~<br /><br />OK PEEPS- It&#039;s gettin&#039; a little crazy around here with everyone asking for BTC, one after another.<br /><br />*Just to be clear, I&#039;d hope for damn sure if one day I needed to ask for a couple .02 BTC or whatever to round up an order somebody&#039;d be there to help out, ya know...<br /><br />Thing is:<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty convinced at least 90% of these beggar threads over the last few days are SCAMMERS just trying to take advantage of the craziness this weekend... I&#039;ve seen people sending BTC to KNOWN scammers, as well as to people who have just joined the forums 2 minutes before they posted to ask for 2 BTC or whatever. To those people, I say FUCK OFF.<br /><br />And to those people who are sending your pretty little BTCs away without thinking...<br /><br />Hey, THANKS for being such a great sport and all. THANKS for trying to make this place a little better. THANKS for trying to help a brother out when he&#039;s in need...<br /><br />BUT.<br /><br />Just THINK ABOUT IT FIRST. Take a couple seconds to check on the OP and see if he&#039;s really genuine. Or at last might be. Or at least isn&#039;t a CONFIRMED scammer.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Oh yeah, and any one who has extra BTC to throw away and just DOESN&#039;T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITH IT can send it here where it will be safe and tight from all the scariness out there in the deep inter(dark) webs: 1HuKMU25qKRBgrochZHzTNRXnWC5T5HTLj

				I don&#039;t think begging threads should be banned. I mean I hope if I&#039;m a bit short one day someone will help me out here.<br /><br />But I do agree that lenders should exercise caution. Shit, EVERYONE should be exercising caution AT ALL TIMES on this site. I think that some people can get sucked into the family that SR is on the forums, such that they can forget that there still are scammers and liars proliferating this place. Talk civilly, gauge trust over time, but always have your guard up.

It is very tough to say.<br /><br />Although not everyone may agree as a single sticky may get largely ignored by any loaners, there has to be a better way than current. I agree that beggar threads clutter up all boards(which they are being posted in every board) as well as push back informative and interesting topics off board. Very large amount of begging overhead.<br /><br />More suggestions please.

				I think the community would do itself a real service by providing a forum for small loans.<br />Whether that means a sticky thread or its own separate forum heading.<br />Yes, they&#039;re risky, no shit. But you can minimize risk, make some measly BTC interest, and provide a great service to people in need.<br /><br />BitCoinTalk forums has one, but very hard for people to get access to who aren&#039;t already established at BitCoinTalk. We should have one for established posters here. Newbies should be able to enter too, but obviously lenders will be more amicable to good reputations.

				Uggh I shouldn&#039;t even admit to this.....&nbsp; I fell for it but it was pocket change so its ok I guess.&nbsp; Rounder if you&#039;re wondering, I wasn&#039;t checking the forums that much, just threads I was watching blah blah blah...&nbsp; <br /><br />If he&#039;s not a scammer he&#039;s just kinda dumb (or maybe I am).&nbsp; Guess I&#039;m not trying that blow from USdirect for a couple of days...
