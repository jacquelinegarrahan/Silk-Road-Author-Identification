				Over the past 24hrs there has been so much discussion about guns on SR and from what i have read it looks like the majority of the community want guns taken down.<br /><br />We as a community have the power to make this happen if we really want too, we can stage an online protest. If&nbsp; vendors go on vacation for 24hrs, SR makes no commission, eventually he will see we are serious and remove the guns from the community.

				SilkRoad Community Strike? Seriously? How can you be ok with the drugs but when a few guns pop up, people are like &quot;omg! Guns kill people!&quot;, bullets kill people, well, people kill people! Everything on this site is potentially lethal! And calling for a strike is gay....

Idealism is a wonderful thing till it takes down my now favorite site. <br />I love guns - especially the really really fast ones.<br />Should they be for sale here?&nbsp; NOT!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;but sadly, it isn&#039;t my call.<br />The whole discussion is really quite silly. business is business - business is good here - PLEASE&nbsp; lets not fuck it up.<br />If u want a gun buy a parts kit and build the receiver yourself.<br />Shit I have bought an 80% receiver myself - if u want a gun that bad drill the 3 f&#039;n holes and shut the fuck up about it.<br />This whole argument is lame and does nothing for the future of this site. <br />I love u for what u do here SR but Idealism only goes as far as when they shut this shit down.<br />tooooo much turmoil, stress, attention and too many infiltrators.<br />I like having a boring life and want to keep it that way!!! <br /><br /><br />One other thing please shut down the new registration parts of the road and here for just one week so we don&#039;t have to deal.<br />I am currently on a giant Xanax and it isn&#039;t working rofl <br />&lt;3 <br />christy

In the end it will be SR&#039;s decision.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ll be the first person to remind ANYONE who seems to have missed the obvious which is the second half of your statement but I don&#039;t think the first is necessarily true.<br /><br />It&#039;s SR&#039;s decision. That is 100% true. This ain&#039;t no fucking democracy, it&#039;s a private business created to allow other private business to thrive in an environment of prohibition while gaining some wealth to be used (or saved) at the discretion of the sites owner/operator in the process. Good old capitalism with an Agorist flair.<br /><br />However, what factors will SR consider in deciding what to allow the USERS (that&#039;s an important consideration I&#039;ll get back to shortly) of this site to promote or not to promote?<br />Obviously there is a huge gun/no-gun debate going on and it ranges from positions of simply wanting to keep the heat as low as possible to positions so pro or anti gun as to have people slinging insults around, crating accounts to &quot;vote&quot; in what they think is a democratic process and just maybe even purposely exposing SR to publicity to &quot;force&quot; their position into the lead consideration in SR&#039;s valuation scale in deciding what&#039;s best for his (their) business.<br /><br />We would have to think that SR hasn&#039;t yet considered banning gun sales from his site to be important enough to actually do it to date.<br />That doesn&#039;t mean he won&#039;t reconsider tomorrow. Any competent entrepreneur is re-evaluating the conditions on the ground constantly, in real time, to keep connected to his market and ahead of ruinous developments.<br />If the weather vane of the SR community (that is a lot more than a single, new forum account) were to REALLY point towards a real&nbsp; need to consider a ban, I&#039;m confident SR would be weighing that possibility and would make whatever move he saw as benefiting HIS wishes for his site.&nbsp; We don&#039;t know for sure just what those wishes are though do we? We have some idea but that&#039;s all we have.<br /><br />Now the point is that should enough vendors ACT on this call to arms (that&#039;s funny right there) then perhaps he will ban gun sales in the face of falling profits. If profits are the point and SR is a competent businessman then that would the action called for to meet market demand.<br />But words and actions are two different worlds. Saying you are going to quit USING SR&#039;s brainchild and doing so are not the same and have very different outcomes.<br />So does quitting for 24 hours or just just plain quitting......period. That&#039;s what I do when I no longer wish to cast the votes my wallet has the power to cast in any given direction.<br />So yes, it is a valid point to poll for how much support you could get in a group withdrawal of SR vendor (and/or buyer) support.<br /><br />But my opinion, if anyone cares (why should they?) is that if you really want a drug only site in the SR tradition, and SR doesn&#039;t care to comply.....then quit using his service.<br />Go out and risk your own neck and host a service JUST LIKE HIS, only with no guns. You could probably ride his coat tails (LIKE YOU ARE NOW!!!!!!) by naming it something like &quot;SilkRoad Gun Free&quot; or something like that.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll bet you won&#039;t find him suing you :)<br />You could copy his CSS right down to the letter, make a site that looked and felt exactly like his in every respect, allow exact copies of account names and PGP keys for seamless integration with his his site and current members. He won&#039;t complain. I&#039;ll bet you 100 BTC he won&#039;t.........GO FOR IT!!!!<br /><br />Just quit being a fucking leech on someone else&#039;s ideas and continuing risks, both financially and legally, while fucking complaining he isn&#039;t doing it YOUR way!<br />Do it your own way and reap the benefits......after putting in the work and taking the risks yourself.<br />From the way the wind BLOWS on the forums here it seems you have success just waiting for you do meet it.

				I guess since the SOPA/PIPA blackouts were a &quot;success&quot;...<br /><br />Yeah, the guns have brought quite a bit of attention to SR, but in all reality that damage has already been done. Truth is that we&#039;re already on their radar, and the decision to keep or remove the gun listings at this point is irrelevant. The only thing we can do now is continue to cover our asses, and pray that when the shit goes down we have left no stone unturned in regards to making sure we&#039;ve done nothing to incriminate ourselves.<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />-DP<br /><br />**edit - typo
