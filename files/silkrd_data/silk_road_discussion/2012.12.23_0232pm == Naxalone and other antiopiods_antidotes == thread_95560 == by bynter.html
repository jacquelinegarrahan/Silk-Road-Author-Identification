				Now while one of the pillars of SR&#039;s foundation is safe drug use, I can&#039;t seem to find anything about drug-antidotes(though Naxalone is the only one I can think of). Would there be a market for this? Has anything like this ever rolled through?

				Yeah naloxone is the one they give to opiate overdoses to bring them round. It&#039;s fairly short acting and is not to be confused with the much longer acting (48hrs+) Naltraxone which is used as a blocker to stop addicts relapsing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Naloxone is included in the buprenorphine&nbsp; brand Suboxone; the idea being that it will only be active when injected; thus preventing abuse of the tablets. However since buprenorphine has a much higher affinity for opiate receptors the naloxone is ineffective whatever the route of administration, as many Suboxone injecting junkys will testify!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You could use a small dose of buprenorphine to bring an OD round I reckon.

				Just look at this as more of a suggestion for an antidotes section. If it was made, I imagine someone would come to fill the spot

				More people have fatal overdoses due to polydrug use of Benzo&#039;s and Alcohol some may have Methadone in their system. Has to be highlighted that Naloxone is a miracle drug but is not effective when people have used Benzos Naloxone only works on the opiate receptors

				So with all that said, if I wanted some Naxalone, Narcan, Naltraxone where would I go? <br /><br />What about if I wanted like an antipsychotic or some other non-scheduled-but-still-Rx-only antidote-like-drug? <br /><br /><br />and why is there not more of an effort to see a Harm Reduction Chemical Section added to the marketplace?&nbsp;

				We sell narcan pre loaded syringes, and usually double first orders. we also throw in an IM needle and nasal atomizer (nasal administration/spray = less withdrawl but longer time to take effect 5-20min <br /><br />edit: its all on our vendor page in our signature
