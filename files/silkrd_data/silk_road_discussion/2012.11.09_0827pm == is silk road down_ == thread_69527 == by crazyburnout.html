				I am having trouble connection. They were doing some maintenance which was disabling new registrations the other day, so it is possible that it is &quot;down&quot; for such reasons. Just as likely is that the server is just swamped.<br /><br />The most likely possibility is a combination of the two. Some servers are down and others have to make up for it by trying to process the same amount of traffic as normal so connections are hard to get.<br /><br />But yes, it seems that connecting is not a possibility at the moment.<br /><br />- The Consultant

				It would be nice for DPR to come in here and at least give us an update on the issue.&nbsp; Maybe give everyone an idea of when things will be running again.
