				If you&#039;re on the road, and you go to a vendors product you like it will say Seller: (whoever the seller is) And Ships from ( wherever it ships from. )<br /><br />Click on the sellers name, and it will take you to their profile. At the top of the page it should say &quot;Send A Message&quot; or something of the sorts. Hope I could help! <br />Welcome to the site.<br /><br />-HG

				I&#039;m a bit of a newbie too. UK based, and search on money and tick the domestic box. You&#039;ll only see vendors from the UK then. That&#039;ll make things a little easier for you. There are a couple on there. You think this is bad, wait until you&#039;ve made your first order and you&#039;re waiting for it to be delivered. <br />Every morning i was waiting in front of the letterbox, bouncing from toe to toe. lol

				I&#039;m pretty new too and getting bitcoins in uk can be quite confusing at the moment, if youve got a smartphone I suggest using this method https://blockchain.info/wallet/deposit-pingit&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Or register with Bitstamp and transfer money there from you bank account then its easy to buy some bitcoins from there, I just did this today. Hope this helps a bit.

				SR is pretty laid back honestly, just keep in mind there is a risk (albeit a small one) and just don&#039;t be careless about the actions you take on or off the road.&nbsp; You&#039;re more likely to get busted for the drugs you receive here because of other criminal activity IRL or trying to resell the products you get here.&nbsp; For like 99% of us who don&#039;t do anything shady that could get us caught, it&#039;s pretty safe.&nbsp; A lot safer than buying drugs from the street even (according to some anonymous PC forensics guy).
