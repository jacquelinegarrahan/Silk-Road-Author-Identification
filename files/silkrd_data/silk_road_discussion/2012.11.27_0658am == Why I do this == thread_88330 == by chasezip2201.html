				I donate to two Spanish young peoples homes/orphanages, the state barley gives them money to survive and they have to turn loads of kids away to temp homes. Also I take them out in groups to the cinema every week! 15 at the time, its so much fun, they LOVE it! Today were going to go see Madagascar 3! Also I teach the angrier / more troubled ones kickboxing. It helps them blow off steam and teaches them to punch a bag or me and not a person. I guess we all go for causes close to our hearts and things that we can relate to..

				Wow y&#039;all are awesome if you really do that. Glad to hear it&#039;s not just about how much you have in your bank accounts.<br />But nah I don&#039;t think you loose your soul! If I were a weed vendor helping someone out who uses it for medical purposes in states that don&#039;t allow it, I&#039;d be very happy! I could see if you were selling a damaging drug though...

				This is the best topic I&#039;ve read all week! Try to reach out to some unexpecting person as often as possible and see how it might change your own life around! Growing up, on the east coast of the US, in poverty, most of the suppliers whom took care of the street dealers, or the majority, always made some sort of positive presences in the community. Between throwing money out of car windows while we rode through the projects to ordering 20 pizzas and a ton wings for a spur of the moment neighborhood pizza party. I know of a close friend who is a parapalegic who rebuilt and owns damn near a whole small city block in an urban ciry and most of the residents who live on the street pay little or no rent at all to stay. His &quot;dope spots&quot; never get raided. They have the tightest neighborhood watch I&#039;ve ever seen in the hood. To this day I give without any hopes of a return and I feel I get blessed all the time. It&#039;s nice to see so many others doing the same. <br /><br /><br />

				I know we&#039;re coming down off a big influx/downtime and at the moment this idea isn&#039;t practical, but what if the SR Community set up an anonymous donation pool and then sponsored a family for X-mas or donated a large sum of BTC/Cash to a charity with a Silk Road attachment too it. Talk about good publicity and a foot in the mouth to Drug War politicians. <br /><br />Not necessarily a Charity Drive, but there are times when I have less than ~$5.00 worth of BTC sitting into my account and a quick option to throw it into the pool would be nice. If everyone did that for a year we could really make a difference in peoples lives through our drug consumptions. <br /><br />Vendors could set up a donate a dollar with every purchase option that is 50/50 covered by the purchaser and seller that would go towards the pool. <br /><br />Is there any steam behind this?<br /><br /><br />

Gotta have a trusted person/account/escrow?/medium that would allow people to donate and know their money is actually going to be used for the cause. (DPR? Mods? System I am too ignorant to know about?)<br />2. Have the Charity voted on and selected with all the details about them up front<br />3.

				As contradictory as it sounds, I do this for the safety and health of drug users around me. I come from a place where the drug game is fueled by greed and greed alone, resulting in drugs that are heavily tainted. I&#039;ve witnessed too many individuals becoming ill after what was supposed to be a fun night of partying.<br /><br />It&#039;s sad because there are so many people who have never experienced a true &quot;high&quot; with their respective drugs, and I aim to give those around me a chance to have a clean experience.<br /><br />That is AWESOME that some of you are able to donate and give to good causes; I wish I made the profits to do that..

To the point where I had 8 big multi layered grow chambers all heat and humidity controlled with home made HEPA air purifyers and timed humidifyers (portable greenhouses) producing fruits at the same time, and 5 incubators all clonising multiple 1Kg bags of mycelium on rye grain. I was so proud of my set up, real (expensive) autoclave, sterile petri dishes, innoc loops, sacks and sacks of rye grain, agar, laminar flow hood (home made), glove box for cloning cultures, Glucose water full of stringy goodness! God that takes me back. We used to put out Kilos and Kilos a month. I might do it again now that I have moved countries, Sadly a jealous ex-gf grassed me up to the police.. I had enough time to bleach the trays with active fruits and mycelium blocks in the incubators thank god for reinforced doors...&nbsp; It is so fulfilling to create something so beautiful and organized... I digress anyway. All I wanted to say was that I have created many TEK´s for bulk production using rye grain you can find most of them on related websites in the clearweb. And if you need any help at all PM me. <br /><br />ACE<br /><br />

Talk about good publicity and a foot in the mouth to Drug War politicians. <br /><br />Not necessarily a Charity Drive, but there are times when I have less than ~$5.00 worth of BTC sitting into my account and a quick option to throw it into the pool would be nice. If everyone did that for a year we could really make a difference in peoples lives through our drug consumptions. <br /><br />Vendors could set up a donate a dollar with every purchase option that is 50/50 covered by the purchaser and seller that would go towards the pool. <br /><br />Is there any steam behind this?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Someone do this!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Awesome idea!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I would donate regularly even if I wasn&#039;t purchasing something. I feel SR would raise tons of money and have it in their name!<br />Soooooo lovin&#039; this idea.&nbsp; &nbsp; Someone seriously make this happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;It cannot be that hard for the mods or some other to do this. Start the donation button now, work the logistics out later. <br /><br /><br />

				I think that would be amazing, I&#039;m just afraid of the spotlight it would shine on our community. It would be touching to see a family sharing an actual christmas because of us but at the same time we would be putting ourselves in the papers once a year, something we generally frown upon. That being said I would much more willingly give my 3 or 4 dollars to charity instead of just buying porn :)<br /><br />Also stinkybreeze +1, love Dexter &lt;3

				That&#039;s a really grand Idea. But I&#039;m not totally sure how that would actually reflect our community there.

				this thread is what SR stands for, its just like i have been watching russell howards good news seg i have a tear in my eye lol&nbsp; :&#039;( , its nice to see the community and vendors alike are not just init for drugs and money, most of us really want to make a difference somewhere or to help those in need, and if my drug habit could contribute i would gladly donate if the SR mods ever did set something like this up...&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />@barbijauna great idea buddy, i just wonder how the press/governments would cover this story pmsl...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />
