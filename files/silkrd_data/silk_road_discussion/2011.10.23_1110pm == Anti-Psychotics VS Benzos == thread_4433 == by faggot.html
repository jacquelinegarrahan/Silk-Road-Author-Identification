				I have tried Seroquel and Zyprexa.<br />I don&#039;t think Zyprexa is that bad, and not that exiting either.<br />Seroquel is really fucked.<br />I took 900mg a day for a couple of years, then I stopped.<br />More than a year of sleep disturbances and paranoia followed.<br />Way more dangerous than heroin in my opinion.<br />I think that heroin withdrawal is a realistic simulation of a major depression,<br />and that Seroquel (quetiapine) withdrawal is a realistic simulation of schizophrenia.<br />You should be able to handle heroin responsible, before you do quetiapine.<br />But if you are curious try taking 25mg quetiapine.<br />Don&#039;t handle any fragile and expensive items the next day.<br />They will break while you are watching !<br />There is more to it, but I&#039;m not sure that you really want to find out...<br />...and not everything is easy to explain.

				Pretty much the only upsides to anti-psychotics (particularly the first generation kind) are that they will knock you the fuck out and make you brain dead. Don&#039;t want to think? That&#039;s your med right there for you. Some people liken taking APs to become emotional zombies.<br /><br />Benzos on the other hand are similar to alcohol - they both act on the same neurotransmittor GABA (the brain&#039;s main inhibitory neurotransmitter) and provide a calming and anti-anxiety and nervousness effect. They can cause dependance in some people unlike antipsychotics which are also prone to discontinuation syndrome. One can get high on benzos, not so much with antipsychotics.<br /><br />So really it depends what kind of effect you&#039;re looking for. Shameless plug, I have a small amount of Haldol, one of the earliest and still most effecti 1st gen antipsychotics for sale. http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/9452<br /><br />I hope this helps you better understand the similarities and difference of benzos and anti psychotics.

				I&#039;ve never really heard of people recreationally using anti-psychotics - but I haven&#039;t really looked into it. I have depression (actually mild bipolar as I&#039;m prescribed Depakote as a mood stabilizer) and have tried tons of meds, mostly SSRIs but I&#039;ve have experience with both AP and Benzos.<br /><br />Benzos are surprisingly easy to get from legitimate sources, providing your not going in to the Dr. and asking for 120 2mg Xanax bars on your first visit. I&#039;ve had 1mg Xanax tablets and after popping a few of them you&#039;ll most certainly feel the effects. Drink a beer and your on the floor. I can only warn you to be careful mixing alcohol and benzos - see what madamebradley mentioned and you&#039;ll understand why.<br /><br />I have 50mg Seroquel tabs at home and used to take them regularly for sleep as they have a killer side effect of you making you drowsy. I stopped taking them for a while and then when I went back and used one, one night and I felt exhausted the next day like I didn&#039;t even get any sleep. I did not like it one bit so I haven&#039;t used any since. :-\<br /><br />Before you build a tolerance to benzos they&#039;ll make you feel drunk and euphoric, but it also has a sedative effect. Seroquel just seems to make you drowsy.<br /><br />If you just want a sleep medication try getting some Ambien (Zolpidem). It works pretty well but when I can&#039;t get to sleep on it, it seems to have a stimulating effect. I&#039;ve used Lunesta for sleep too, but that leaves a gross taste in your mouth in the morning. ;)<br />

				Anti Psychotics/Depressants/SSRIs make me sick and slow. no euphoria. feeling of not being yourself<br />No Euphoria what so ever. and i do not recommend attempting to get fucked up off of ANY type of ssr,anti-d or p<br />Bad widthdrawal after taking continuously. You will not feel like yourself while taking them as stated, also when going through widthdrawal you wont feel like yourself.<br />Possibility of addiction due to widthdrawals after taking for a long time.<br /><br />Benzos just basically calm your thinking, sedate you a bit, bit of muscle relaxation, etc. and depending on the dosage a bit of euphoria.<br />Benzos are one of the 3 drug types you can die from the widthdrawals from. (Alcohol, Benzos, Barbituates, GHB...)<br />Possibility of addiction.<br /><br />imo benzos are better, but those are some general pros and cons for you. remember everyone is different.

				I&#039;ve taken both anti-psychotics and benzos, and only the benzos are actually enjoyable to me. There also seems to be some question about whether long term use of anti-psychotics causes permanent brain damage, although I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s a scientifically valid concern or just an unfounded rumour. However, if you&#039;re talking about anti-psychotics vs benzos while tripping, it changes a little. Benzos will relax you during a trip, take away your anxiety, but they will not stop you tripping. Take a reasonable dose of an anti-psychotic, however, and you&#039;ve got yourself a bad trip escape pod! I&#039;m not sure how long it takes as I&#039;ve never needed to do it, but I&#039;ve heard anti-psychotics are fairly quick at aborting trips.

				Basically IMO,Anti Psychotics have really nasty side effects,they don&#039;t give you any euphoric effects or anything that could be called &#039;recreational&#039;,like someone&#039;s already said they just stop you from thinking and knock you out but NOT in a good way like a few benzos or some H.<br />Benzos on the otherhand will make you feel pretty good,relaxed without knocking you out (unless you take the strongest of a few) and you&#039;ll feel ok the day after,no dry,fluffy mouth like you&#039;ll get AP&#039;s or the awful day after feelings.<br />Some people may like AP&#039;s but i think you&#039;ll find most people will want benzos for recreational purposes and not AP&#039;s,even people who are prescribed AP&#039;s probably wont take them cos of the way they make them feel,but hey,if you wanna be a brain dead zombie for the duration knock yourself out lol.<br />Beware of addiction with both kinds and use sparingly,believe me you don&#039;t wanna experience withdrawl&#039;s from either...

				@16bitgirl: No offense, but I learned a lesson the hard way and I would not suggest to anyone seeking to &quot;end a bad trip&quot; to take an anti-psychotic medication.<br /><br />It looks like it would work well on paper... being an antagonist at the 5HT2A &amp; 2C as well as the Dopamine receptors...<br /><br />I thought I had taken my first dose of acid which actually turned out to be DOB and a bean (who knows what was in it...). The entire night was fucking incredible and I still swear I was sitting in a rainforest at one point... but at nearly +20 hours and I was ready to be able to sleep. So my friend and I split a seroquel...<br /><br />The next thing I remember, our sitter is smacking me in the face, yelling my name, and I am fighting to regain consciousness after collapsing onto the floor and convulsing for a number of minutes. I spent the next few minutes fighting to crawl outside into the subzero temperatures because I felt like I was overheating and my nervous system was sizzling, all the while still shaking uncontrollably. Too make a long story short I spent the next 24 hours slowly improving through a very uncomfortable panic attack/schizophrenic type situation (including crazy voices in my head) with severe &quot;pins and needles&quot; tingling... And it was terrifying because I did not know if I was going to return to normal. My friend reacted in the same way although less severely, but we still both discuss the potential that it has affected at the very minimum our mental stability permanently. <br /><br />Granted, we were not simply on only a classical 5HT2A psychedelic, and there were many confounding factors... but I simply do not think it is worth the risk.<br /><br />I have learned one should be responsible and prepared for any psychedelic experience and then just enjoy the ride. However, a benzo after the trip is over, during the afterglow, provides for a relaxing and enjoyable comedown some would say...

				microRNA, no offence taken :) My &quot;knowledge&quot; of anti-psychotics being taken for that purpose is purely what I&#039;ve read, which I took to be reliable both because it had come from numerous sources, and because Albert Hoffman was one of those who suggested it, but I&#039;ve never needed to use them for that purpose (even though I do have a stash for emergencies) so I&#039;ve never experienced the effects myself. On the other hand, I&#039;ve read it a lot with no mention of that level of side effects, so it may be that your reaction was atypical. In any case, I&#039;ve always considered that stash to be for absolute emergency, &quot;LSD has literally taken me to hell&quot; kinds of situations.
