				Hi SR users! I have been looking into using silk road and finally decided to place my first order! i am looking to order a small quantity of cocaine, 1g, 0.5g, i have researched some of the top sellers and their feedback. Can anybody who has maybe tried several vendors tell me who they thought had the best product? Any feedback will be greatly appreciated!

				Hey Barney, welcome to the SR! Head on over to the Rumor Mill forum for reviews and discussions pertaining to vendors and product. Take a look at some of the later pages on this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=435.0<br /><br />Seems like there&#039;s a wealth of information on exactly what you&#039;re looking for. Normally I&#039;d personally let you know from any sort of personal experience but this ones out of my game. Hopefully that thread is still a help for you though.<br /><br />~Grecko

				I ordered 2.5 from sesampino(97) on Friday and it arrived today. good packaging and good quality. I&#039;d say it&#039;s as pure as they claim and the price is good too.

				Mostly the shipping / communication / etc. was excellent for all of them. Below is my rating of the product:<br /><br />dutchqualitybeans - 6/10, short (more like .25 instead of .5)<br />hybridmike - 5/10 (batch he sent me was about 50% filler, and i know my shit)<br />paperchasing - 9/10 - excellent<br />tetravort - 8/10 - very smooth, but when i used to wash stuff mine was better. also, washing looses all the flavor / scent.<br /><br />hope this helps. if anyone knows of better lmk
