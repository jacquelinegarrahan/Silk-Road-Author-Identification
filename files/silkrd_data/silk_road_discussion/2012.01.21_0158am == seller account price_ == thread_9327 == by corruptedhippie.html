				They do make a small commission, but the vendor fee is also there to protect buyers from scammers. You can sell for free on black market reloaded. What are you looking to sell? I could help move it for you.

				Listings are free once you&#039;ve purchased your vending account :)<br />Anyone thinking the costs of vending are high here should try vending somewhere on the clearnet. monthly fees, listing fees, picture fees etc on top of high commission fees, compared to them SR is a bargain for vendors :)

				When I was vending spores on clear net it was $20 a month for the web site, $200 a month for the advertising on 1 web site, the CC processor took 6.5% of the sale + $2.35 for each order, Then there was the phone line, as well as other overhead. To add insult to injury, the government took 30% of everything I made in taxes.<br /><br />When I saw the $150 for the account here I thought to my self, $150 a month is not bad I may be able to make that and it is worth a shot. Then I saw it was a $150 one time fee and the small % of the sale not a monthly fee and I was ready to set it up.<br /><br />These threads come up regularly, $150 is nothing! If you can not come up with the $150 you need for the account, then you should not be selling on here! The cost is nothing in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />So, I guess my response is put up or shut up! Bitching will not make the price go down.

The poor scammers are poor because they are bad scammers so they arnt much of a threat anyway. But the good scammers will never have a shortage of cash therefore a high account fee will not deter them in anyway.
