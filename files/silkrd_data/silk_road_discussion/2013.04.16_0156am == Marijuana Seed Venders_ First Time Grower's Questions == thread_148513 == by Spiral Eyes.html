				I&#039;m looking for some advice on where/what to get for seeds. I&#039;ve never grown before and want to try some plants up in the mountains where I go camping. I live in a northern USA mountain state, and I live about 3-4 hours from where I&#039;d be planting. I need something that won&#039;t need a ton of attention, but will receive a lot of love. There&#039;s not a huge selection of seeds here on SR, but I would like to order here. I have my eye on Plutopete and Greenworks. Anyone have experience growing the seeds they&#039;re offering?&nbsp; I know this is sort of a broad reaching question, but I could certainly use a broad range of advice&nbsp; &nbsp;;D&nbsp; &nbsp;

				If this is your first time i suggest you start with auto plants. They are easy to grow, dont need much care and can grow in colder climates. They are also midget plants and dont grow taller than 60cm. Perfect for a stealth grow. <br /><br />Go to altitude seeds or dopeseeds on the clearnet and buy female auto seeds.

That&#039;s great info.&nbsp; I was looking at this before posting and already had it in queue :&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/278a24390e<br /><br />Is it really possible to buy seeds on clear net without a med card? I mean, that can&#039;t be legal can it?

				Buy seeds on clearnet.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get someones f2s or worse off here.&nbsp; You want nice stable genetics. www.seedboutique.com&nbsp; Seni Seeds have been around forever and have great genetics.&nbsp; Nirvana are cheap but not stable have you get several phenotypes.&nbsp; Just research and research some more.&nbsp; Growing cannabis is simple.<br /><br />There are plenty of great seed breeders.&nbsp; I used to chat with subcool and mdanzig on overgrow over a decade ago before they were breeders.&nbsp; I got my first lowryders off of mdanzig :)

				Yeah dont buy any seeds from here..they are the same price as seedbanks on the clearnet difference being that the seedbanks will sell you exactly what they list, here you dont know if its someones shitty bag weed or a really crappy strain advertised as some kind of knock out ryder.<br /><br />Herbies is also good and has awesome stealth.

				I will vouch for attitude seeds from the Netherlands.&nbsp; Look it up on the clearnet.&nbsp; The seeds will take a little while to arrive but it is worth it.&nbsp; You can choose a stealth option and get a poster/t-shirt with the order to make it look more legit.&nbsp; They even allow you to mix and match seeds and buy just one seed of each kind if you want.

				If you&#039;re not in a hurry to start you can mail cash to a the big seedbanks like attitude and herbies in the EU so you don&#039;t have to have anything incriminating show up on your credit card.

				Any of the diesel ryder auto strains are so easy to grow. In fact you really need to be a bad grower if you kill any auto. They are so resilient and just grow. One golden rule is to just water them lightly for the first 2 weeks and then feed them your normal nutes. <br /><br />Be aware that they only produce small amounts, sometimes even just 7 grams even with a 10 litre pot. Best bet is to get a grow tent and a 250 W HPS..dont even bother with CFLS as you are using the same power but with less lumens that a HPS light. <br /><br />Once you start growing them in different ways and start to experiment the fun begins and before you know it you will be growing 7 plants every 2-3 months. I have 14 going atm.<br /><br />That growweed site is excellent even though they slam autos, but autos have dived the growing community. The old timers dont like them at all (i would too if i had been used to growing huge tall sativa plants for 25 years) cause they produce so little but the new age growers love them as you can grow a lot of different strains in a small area and in stealth.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know why people are suggesting autoflowering stranis.&nbsp; They are cool novelty strains and I bred them for eight years but you get the autoflowering trait by crossing indicas or sativas with ruderalis.&nbsp; Ruderalis is autoflowering hemp.&nbsp; If you are a cannabis noob then autoflowers would be fine for you but if you are used to the top shelf grade A better than most of Silk Road kind of shit like me then autoflowering strains arn&#039;t for you.&nbsp; Something simple as pie like northern lights would be stronger and simple.&nbsp; Northern lights isn&#039;t a picky strain like say blueberry.&nbsp; But hey I only grew cannabis for decades what do I know.&nbsp; Have fun!

				Autos are cute and fun but other than a novelty I don&#039;t see the reason to have shittier genetics.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fact the genes are shittier and that cannot be disputed.&nbsp; To make autos you cross good genes with garbage hemp genes and back cross with good genes and keep doing it until it is stable with decent strength with a high autoflowering rate.&nbsp; I did it for eight years for fun.&nbsp; Autos are cute lol.&nbsp; What&#039;s so damn hard about changing your light cycle?&nbsp; Besides having better genetics you can also control the size and cycle of your plant.

				Fair enough. The only issue i have with autos is the amount you yeild..for the effort and time you get fuck all, so i will agree with you on that. But i guess thats why you grow a dozen casue they are small so you have room.<br /><br />Im a snob as well..i hate 3 cone gear..hate it cause i know the next sesh will be 4 then 5 cones and before i know it i have gone through all my stash in one day.<br /><br />I can smoke a whole auto plant in one weekend..thats how small the yeilds are! lol

I&#039;d just look for a hardy strain that needs very little tending. Northern Lights is known to be resilient, but I&#039;d research as many strains as possible to find one that&#039;ll fit perfect with your growing conditions and situation. I&#039;ll throw my hat in with the camp that thinks autoflowering strains aren&#039;t worth the effort; if you&#039;re going through so much trouble to find a clandestine grow site, investing so much in time and travel, you should go for the most potent bud, and biggest yields possible.<br /><br />Autoflowers are interesting, and perhaps in another ten to twenty years it&#039;ll be all anyone grows, but for right now, they&#039;re still not worth it in my opinion.<br /><br />Edit: also, be sure to get feminized seeds. In your situation, you wont be around enough to reliably catch and remove males as they revel themselves, so you&#039;ll probably end up with a few females getting pollinated, which ruins the bud.
