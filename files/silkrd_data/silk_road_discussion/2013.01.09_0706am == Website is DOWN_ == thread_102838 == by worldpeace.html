				Fine for me. In fact, it&#039;s the fastest it&#039;s been in a while,. Try hitting the &#039;New Identity&#039; button on top of the browser. It&#039;s the little green onion.

				Working fine even for me and I have a very slow connection right now. <br /><br />Other than what others suggested check that you are typing the right address.<br /><br />I am new, but I found sometimes you just have to be patient and keep trying. You will eventually get in.<br /><br />

				Yup, worked fine just a few minutes ago.<br /><br />But I have had times where I reload over and over, use new ID, etc and it still won&#039;t load. Happens with the forums too sometimes. Not sure what causes it, but it&#039;s frustrating as hell when it happens.

				Well after about ten minutes of refreshing, it&#039;s working now and quickly.&nbsp; Guess it was just a fluke
