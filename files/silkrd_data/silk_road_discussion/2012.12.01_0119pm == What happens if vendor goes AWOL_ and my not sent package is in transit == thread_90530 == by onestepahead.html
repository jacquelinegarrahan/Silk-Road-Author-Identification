				I agree with coolkid321, but don&#039;t let it go too long. After seven days it should arrive almost anywhere in the same country.

				I think he put it in transit so you can&#039;t cancel. Not a nice move.<br />SR support won&#039;t do much, they involve when it&#039;s been a long time and it goes to resolution.<br />Only thing you can do now is wait. After and if you get the package give him a bad feedback explaining what happened. That&#039;s what I would do. Also give his name on the forum, that&#039;s why we have them.<br />Good luck.

				Vendors can cancel orders after they&#039;ve been placed in transit.&nbsp; I recommend that you send a message to the vendor asking him to please cancel your order.&nbsp; It won&#039;t hurt to ask, and if he signs in and cancels then it makes everything easier as you don&#039;t have to wait for resolution to resolve.
