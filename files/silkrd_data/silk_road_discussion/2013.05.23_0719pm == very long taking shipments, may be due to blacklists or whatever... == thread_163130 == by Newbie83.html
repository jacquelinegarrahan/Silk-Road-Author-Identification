				In transit means different things to different vendors.<br />In transit could mean he has it packed ready to go out<br />It could mean its in the mail<br /><br />2days is not long.&nbsp; you need to relax and wait.&nbsp; if it has been 7days then begin to worry.

				As others have said give it time. the fastest order i ever recieved was 2 days domestic! and that was <br />with extra postage paid! OS orders, i had one take almost 30days to show up, but it did.<br />the mail can be very flaky. also depends what day it got sent. just because it was marked in transit <br />doesnt mean it was sent out. hope that comforts you a little. patience my friend.

				Check the vendor profile and see if they mention anything about shipping days.&nbsp; Some vendors only ship out on certain days so even though the item is marked in transit on webnesday but the vendor may only ship mon - fri then it wouldn&#039;t be dropped at the post office until the friday so that could be where the extra time is coming from. <br /><br />I imagine in transit basically means it&#039;s addressed and ready to go and will be shipped asap if it hasn&#039;t been already.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Once a vendor marks something in transit I think I read that they can&#039;t see the address anymore, can anyone confirm that?

Once a vendor confirms the order, the address disappears<br /><br />As to confirming the order ( marking it in transit ), it is up to the vendor to decide when to confirm the order. Personally I don&#039;t confirm the order until it has been mailed.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what country you are in, but you also have to realize that domestic shipping could still take a while. For example, in Canada or the USA, domestic shipping could still mean sending it 5000 miles depending on the vendor&#039;s and buyer&#039;s locations. I have had Expresspost shipments ( supposedly 2 day delivery ) take over a week to arrive.

				Dear OP I did hard spam work to reach 50 and leave a comment. I do understand your paranoia, especially when u have kids and a good job etc. and the strange stamped and opened package u got before.<br /><br />Usual shipment time domestic in Germany is 1-3 days...there have been many bank holidays[Pfingsten etc.] the last weeks which could increase the shipping time.<br />There have been two confirmed busts in Germany of online drug dealers. One was selling on Silkroad btw the other one had a clearnet side. Conclusion, they go after customers when they find any information e.g. labeled letters, database of customers &gt;:( [hopefully not on the road]...etc.<br /><br />I did a lot of research about the consequences u face when u get busted with a personal amount which is defined different for each &#039;state&#039; in Germany. I do not know which drug u ordered and u better don&#039;t post the amount in here for your own safety&nbsp; ;) <br />I found a few cases where they canceled the lawsuit and bribed them. It depends on your social context, former crime record, amount, &#039;state&#039;, kind of drug and how u react and what they find when they search your home [some judges give permission to a search warrant for small amounts although it is not &quot;verhaeltnismaessig&quot;] Silkroad offers a main difference to these cases, cause it would be hard for LE to proof your payment or proof u ordered it. I don&#039;t know how much evidence is enough to see it as proofen for the court.[Like buying BTC, using Tor, package found is enough ?]<br />Anyway take all precautions u can for the time the package is on its way, it is not unusual it just takes longer this time. Or it opened in the sorting machine and the professionalism of your vendor will be tested, I heard of one customer who got the package anyway cause the inner layer was stealth enough too.<br />If worst case happens be prepared, be sure to act right and keep your head up...usually u won&#039;t get a high enough sentence so that it is written into your criminal records. <br /><br />Unfortunately u will face LE trying their bad-cop-good-cop-i-saw-it-in-USmovies-and-try-it-now-in-Germany-tactics, trying to trick u into confession[not any word without lawyer is recommended] by lies which is allowed for LE in D. Notice u don&#039;t have to say anything to LE no matter what they say. Even denying anything could be wrong, German court won&#039;t see saying nothing without your lawyer not as a confession...only in court u have to say sth but then u will have a lawyer already.<br /><br />I just hope I could help u a bit,<br />u can&#039;t influence the following when it arrives u have been lucky in the other case u are as good as possible prepared,<br />keep your head up,<br />all the best,<br /><br />Idnlp<br />

				You can think yourself to death ordering illegal drugs online that arrive to your house. You&#039;ll kill yourself with negative thoughts and ideas of what might happen. No matter how great or fast you THINK your seller is, get that out of your head now because you are not their only customer that they wait around on for your order and combine that with lots of different reasons in between you and the seller that could slown you getting your order!<br /><br />I learned after a while that a lot of patience is needed using SR!<br /><br />No matter what MIGHT happen in the future, NEVER admit to anything if you ever are asked anything regarding a package you are waiting on through SR. Good luck!

				Delayed shipments do not necessarily mean you are under surveillance or blacklisted or anything. I have a Priority envelope that I have been waiting for for almost three weeks now. I realize that with every passing day it&#039;s less likely to show up and could be lost forever under a Gorilla rack at a USPS distribution center but I&#039;m still hopeful it will show up soon. Looking on Google I&#039;ve heard of domestic USPS Priority taking a fucking month in rare cases. <br /><br />My vendor uses amazing stealth (like, if someone were to open it you would not be able to tell it&#039;s illegal drugs) and I have no criminal history and am smart about my drug use so it&#039;s very unlikely that LE would be watching me. You have to realize that the USPS is a shitty institution that is only getting shittier due to cuts and consolidation within its infrastructure.

				sorry for the delay. i nearly forgot this thread due to some trouble...<br />my order arrived 2 days after i started this thread. this is quite long for germany (1 - 2 days are normal). and the vendor writes on his page that &#039;in transit&#039; means &#039;in transit&#039;.<br />but thanks to all the guys who tried to help me! :) this goes especially to IDoNotLikeProhibition; spamming 50 posts only for answering here is just fabulous. ;)

That was definitely a fucking stressful three and a half weeks and I&#039;m glad it&#039;s over. The product itself was undamaged but the envelope was dirty and scuffed up so maybe it probably was lost under a shelf at a distribution center for a while.

				Read a post on here a while ago that some guy&#039;s order never arrived and after a month or more received a full refund and a couple of weeks later it turns up having gone to Africa first and I think the guy was in the States. The address was correct but somehow it went to Africa first. Crazy!
