				first off, everyone&#039;s alias was reset recently back to their main account names.&nbsp; This was a mistake, but unfortunately is irreversible, so I just went ahead and removed every discussion post so far because there was no way of knowing who was affected.&nbsp; Also, when you click &quot;remove&quot; on one of your posts, it will remove it entirely instead of just saying &quot;(deleted)&quot;.<br /><br />There are a few concerns that have been brought up about this feature and I would like to address them now.<br /><br />Q: Is it going to be a free for all full of scams and spam?<br />A: Hopefully not.&nbsp; There is currently a $100 minimum spent requirement for posting, and our admins have the power to suspend an accounts ability to post.&nbsp; So, if anyone is abusing the system, they will have to spend another $100 at least to do it again.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see this being profitable, but if it is and we have a systemic problem, we can always raise this requirement.<br /><br />Q: Won&#039;t vendors be able to know who is posting since they can see their customer&#039;s stats?<br />A: Yes.&nbsp; However that is only true for a small window of time when they have access to the buyer&#039;s stats and the buyer&#039;s stats haven&#039;t changed.&nbsp; If this is a concern for you, then you should not post in the threads of vendor that can make this deduction<br /><br />Q: Isn&#039;t this redundant since we have the rumor mill forum board?<br />A: There is a certain amount of overlap, but I think this is a much improved system at least in concept and we can keep working at it to make it better.&nbsp; It is much more convenient to have the thread associated with the category/vendor/item right there on the site.&nbsp; A user&#039;s stats (reputation) is right there, helping people know who&#039;s posts to trust.<br /><br />Q: Shouldn&#039;t a vendor be able to opt out?<br />A: They can opt out by going into stealth mode.&nbsp; If they want to be a public SR vendor, then people should have the option to discuss them and their items.<br /><br />One concern that was raised is the pain it will be for vendors to check the discussions for all of their various items.&nbsp; This is valid and I have it on the list to make this easier for them.

				Thanks for taking notice so quickly. I realized that it would be difficult to rollback the change of aliases but figured informing people of the situation would help people to realize and fix the problem faster.

				I asked in the other thread as well but I guess&nbsp; this thread will be more active.<br /><br />Any chance that discussion could be limited to domestic when you have domestic only enabled? There were no posts to check with after it was reset, but when I was looking at it earlier the category discussion stayed worldwide. Not really possible to discuss domestic markets of smaller markets when the rest of the world is there as well. :p

You yourself have spoken about how unruly and unaccurate it is over there. The inmates are running the aslyum, and you will be importing that now.<br /><br />How many times have you seen a buyer make a post in here slamming a vendor only to have the vendor paste the entire message history and expose the buyer as an obvious liar running a BS scam. You see this all the time in here. When you strip away a vendors ability to defend against the bullshit libel that will taint his listings you do little to add additional buyer security and just weaken an otherwise honest vendor.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, two simple steps could achieve a similar result.<br /><br />1. Create a sub-forum in here called Vendor Reviews. Make it open to everyone, including those with less than 50 posts.<br /><br />2. Make it mandatory for all vendors to have a review thread in their listings. Most honest vendors do this already. (You make displaying PGP keys mandatory so this isn&#039;t that different).<br /><br />You now gave an easy and quick way for the casual buyer to click a link to see the latest chatter on that vendor without having to create an account here.<br /><br />Rogue posts can now be covered by the same moderators in here and the discussion will be more vibrant because it&#039;s not as disjointed and hard to access. <br />

				Thanks for more information about the new feature. But this is disconcerting:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=205590.msg1477422#msg1477422">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on August 21, 2013, 08:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Q: Shouldn&#039;t a vendor be able to opt out?<br />A: They can opt out by going into stealth mode.&nbsp; If they want to be a public SR vendor, then people should have the option to discuss them and their items.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Many vendors will strongly disagree about the only option to disable it is to go stealth. That&#039;s certainly not fair nor congruent with the stealth options available for individual listings rather than going stealth for the entire account. Plus, everyone on SR can opt out of or into the category discussion by using or not using it. <br /><br />Many vendors, including us, have stealth links for custom orders, special clients, out of stock items and for testing listings before making them public. We don&#039;t need to go into stealth mode for the account to conceal those relatively few individual listings. <br /><br />Since vendors are able to individually select listings to be placed in stealth mode rather than going fully into stealth mode, there should be the option to disable discussion. This was not part of any agreement vendors signed on for like the understanding that commissions can be changed without notice. This is a feature.<br /><br />Moreover, vendors are able to select pre or post commission pricing. They are able to opt in/out of auto-withdrawls, set backup wallets, choose to enable hedging or not. And even ask buyers to FE (if the vendor is past a certain threshold). <br /><br />Is the future of SR going to be about less vendor options? Not feeling the free market vibe. <br /><br />This new feature gets enforced but disallowing FE gets a blind eye? The ability of vendors and buyers to engage in Finalizing Early (FE) is the single most destructive attribute of SR and has lead to the loss of money and participants more so than any other activity or practice. But Libertarian values being as they are, make self determination and self responsibility an exercise for the individual. The individual can chose to FE or not. They can opt out of the escrow system at will and whim. <br /><br />But we vendors can&#039;t opt out of a feature which was implemented without any input from vendors and deprives vendors of their free market, Libertarian right to self determination and personal responsibility. <br /><br />But buyers who rightfully worry that their stats are in full public view which can lead to them being profiled and identified irrespective of an alias (whose feature had a bug that exposed their real buyer identities which I&#039;m sure a lot of vendors took note of), can opt out of this feature by not using it. <br /><br />There&#039;s a disconnect in there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please consider giving vendors the ability to opt out of this feature like all the many features vendors can opt in/out of. There are many vendors who do not like the feature and don&#039;t want it nor asked for it. It&#039;s not enough that a message can be flagged for review and *might* be removed within 24 hours. It&#039;s not enough that a poster can be banned from using the discussion system. (Though the $100 spending requirement is nice though, have to admit). The system can be used nefariously in subtle ways especially against new vendors who often have to endure feedback blackmail until they establish themselves.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not asking to jettison the entire system. (Though some vendors would probably like that). But while allowing individual vendors the ability to opt out of the discussion feature for their profile pages and listings, you won&#039;t be consequently disabling or neutering the feature since categories will still have discussion ability to which everyone can opt in/out of by choosing to post or not post. No one can &quot;stealth&quot; a category.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for your consideration in advance. I&#039;m confident that you will at least give it some thought. You&#039;ve proven to be reasonable and rational in the past. There&#039;s no reason why anyone should think that would not continue to be the case. <br /><br />

				So we can have a discussion page for vendors, their items and each category... but what about commenting on BUYERS?!?!?!<br /><br />Sure would be nice if I could read &quot;Buyer tried to extort me&quot; or some such instead of having to go to the forums and search each name.<br /><br />Seriously, vendors need a better way of tracking buyers. This would be perfect.

It&#039;s something designed to benefit buyers. You don&#039;t have to worry about trolls because for every troll, there should be a slew of customers who know the truth, and they definitely will make a post about their experience if they see someone making outlandish claims. You can also write your own post and refute any claims by made trolls.<br /><br />I think this feature makes SR more mainstream and it also helps to allay any fears new members may have of being scammed. It should also help vendors to become more professional and more competitive. You&#039;re only focusing on the possible negatives of this feature. And I understand that from your perspective, the time you put in may not be worth any potential benefits.. But this is more of a tool for buyers, and even though I said it&#039;s designed to benefit buyers, vendors may certainly benefit by: not receiving as many messages and seeing an increased amount of sales.

				Yes, I deleted the last three posts of mine. I got pissed because in this situation, I can&#039;t win. There is no way to prove the authenticity of my mushrooms without compromising security<br /><br />The only way you could do it, is have some random sample professionally tested in a lab, and even then any future samples would be in doubt. We don&#039;t have the luxury here of being open with our real names and having a mycologist verify that you&#039;re&nbsp; a top expert in the field<br /><br />Many of the items here on Silk Road is based on trust. You either trust the vendor or you don&#039;t. That is why we have a feedback system, in order to build trust. This new forum for chat bypasses that and allows anyone with doubts to override 6 months of built up trust in the feedback<br /><br />In my case, it wasn&#039;t good enough that this one person didn&#039;t trust me and simply did not buy a product. No, this person wanted to make sure that other people also did not trust me

If it was easier, I&#039;d send them whole, but for some people they would still have doubts about my mushrooms because they are not common outside the west coast and you wouldn&#039;t recognize them unless you&#039;re already familiar with them. I have photos of them wild, wet and dried already posted on my forums. Having dried whole ones isn&#039;t going to help you ID them if you don&#039;t already know what they are<br /><br />That&#039;s why it&#039;s a catch 22...You can&#039;t win with some people, which was fine, because many people DO trust my expertise and I had no shortage of repeat customers<br /><br />1 paranoid person blew all that to smithereens

				Thanks for the positive words and I don&#039;t want to leave, but i don&#039;t want people to be needlessly paranoid about my shrooms either<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are plenty of people who are comfortable with my shrooms based on the feedback and experience, but all it takes is one look at that new listing forum and the next time they trip it&#039;s like &#039;gee, am I going to die now&#039;?<br /><br />well, there goes the trip. Golly, it seemed nice before I saw that, but now it&#039;s just plain scary<br /><br />I mean, really. This was already recently discussed in my own forum about how scary these mushrooms already are. because they are much more potent than your normal cubensis, anything over 1 gram for beginners can be very scary. the onset is scary enough as it is, because it is a very strong psychedelic. In many cases the onset of mushrooms already feels like you&#039;re facing your own death. This is well documented for many years<br /><br />You start adding needless paranoia like this on top of the already scary onset, and then people start leaping out windows just to make it faster. I mean just to get it over with quicker because this time cyanspore might have screwed up and it&#039;s better to just end it now rather than spend 2 weeks in the hospital. I mean, c/mon, that&#039;s all I need on my conscience<br /><br />It&#039;s very well known that with true psychedelics a comfortable set and setting is near mandatory to prevent people from freaking out. You just can&#039;t mess with peoples minds like this. It&#039;s irresponsible<br /><br />The original DPR would know this since he started out vending shrooms here long ago. Anyone who&#039;s had a level 5 trip would know this. It&#039;s not something to play around with<br /><br />Now do you see why this issue is so important?

				or let me put it this way for the record. If i get a single verified report of any poisoning from my mushrooms, i will shut the whole thing down immediately, cancel all current orders, and then donate whatever i have left over to the person who got poisoned<br /><br />That&#039;s how confident i am it will never happen<br /><br />I simply don&#039;t want people to be able to plant paranoid seeds into people who want to experience the best there is and then have it being a totally messed up trip so they will never do shrooms again<br /><br />That does more damage than actual poisonings, which have never been documented for psilocybe cyanescens, except for one screw up by a child who picked them wild back in the 1970&#039;s. This is on the wikipedia page<br /><br /><br />But you&#039;re right, I should just not answer his question. But I don&#039;t like it. This is not good for shrooms. People need to feel comfortable when doing these. I tried to tell this person my reputation speaks for itself, but some people are just never going to be convinced. We pro hunters have had to deal with this for years, News reports of ignorant amateurs poisoning themselves. Mushroom phobia that goes back to the old english days with witches and paganism and burning naked at the stakes and all that malarkey<br /><br />Thankfully, it&#039;s now much more of a science. Mycology is absolutely a science and it has progressed tremendously in the last 20 years. There is no reason why anyone should get poisoned any more in 2013 by any mushrooms unless you&#039;re ignorant<br /><br />This ignorance causes more damage than anything else...That&#039;s what really gets my goat<br /><br />sorry about that..scuse me while I bang on the keyboard some more out of sheer frustration...*pound pound pound*

If you don&#039;t travel or go in post offices, you might have a friend do it. Be sure you grab free boxes and ask for tracking labels while your at it. If they say no (labels), try another post office if you get a chance.<br />I think stamps and a blue box for packages under 13 OZs are so much safer (even for powder). <br /><br />As for freaking out buyers of mushrooms, how you react to baseless comments can be more harmful then the bad comments. I would not be mentioning worse-case scenarios like jumping out of windows just to make a point (well I guess I just did, but, it is a bad idea, lol).

				with the new stats that are displayed with reviews and discussion posts are estimated for security purposes which I understand but I would prefer to see the #vendors category to differentiate&nbsp; between a buyer who has bought from 2-10 vendors vs just 1 vendor because this helps me weigh the credibility of the &quot;buyer&quot; as genuine or a &quot;sock puppet&quot;&nbsp;
