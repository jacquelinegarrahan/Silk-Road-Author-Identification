				As long as you&#039;re not a dumb fuck, and don&#039;t admit to it, not much. Just because something was sent in your name and to your home, doesn&#039;t mean that you ordered it, basically. They would have to prove that you ordered it.

				If it is a small amount, you&#039;ll probably only get a &quot;love letter&quot; - The LE wont waste their time or money going after people ordering a gram or so on the internet.<br /><br />Although, if it&#039;s something substantial and they think you are getting it with the intent to deal - they will try bust your ass somehow.

				I don&#039;t know the exact % but its approx 80% of people incriminate themselves on video interview, the police tell you beforehand that you don&#039;t have to say anything, (this is your right, you can not get in trouble for not answering their questions) and that what you do say they will use as evidence against you, so pretty much most of the time they have fuck all on you apart from circumstancal*(spelling?) evidence, which is fuck all, i know this for a fact, NEVER EVER talk to the police, NEVER admit ANYTHING, no matter what situation you are in, No matter how much trouble your in take my advice and say NOTHING to the police, say NO COMMENT to EVERY question they ask you, no matter what they say to you, they will try all their tricks, they will try everything to try and make you talk, even if they remand you unless it is a VERY MAJOR charge and i mean VERY MAJOR, you WILL get bail, it might take upto 24 hours to get bailed infront of a judge etc, but you WILL get bail. i am speaking from many experiences, Also what you get charged with and what you get convicted of are 2 very different things, Most people give themselves up thinking that they are screwed, DON&quot;T SAY A FUCKING WORD, no matter what you get caught doing/with. There are many parts of the law that most people don&#039;t understand, one of them is circumstancal* evidence. <br />Ask a lawyer and they will tell you the exact same as i have. NO COMMENT no matter what trouble you are in.

The more you try to insulate yourself you make it harder to deny knowledge of it and if LE connects the dots complex plains can provide&nbsp; proof of intent. <br /><br />Just keep your plan simple. And only personal use. <br /><br />Don&#039;t involve other people. <br /><br />If LE bothers to pay you a visit say nothing. <br /><br />Don&#039;t consent to a search of your person or property.<br /><br />Stay safe. Stay smart and stay free.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				well I am vendor and I send many packages to the States and I have never had any seized on the US soil.<br />In fact I feel that they either never check the stuff properly or they don&#039;t bother about them. A lot depends on what is there in the package and how is&nbsp; it packed.<br /><br />If your stuff does get seized, then if they feel like it was important and big enough for them, then they monitor you, come searching at your place and try to catch you at a point when you just can&#039;t deny or get saved somehow. So if&nbsp; you ever get a letter or your package gets seized then just stop your activity for sometime or&nbsp; hide it the best you can.<br /><br />Wishing you all the very best of love and drugs!!<br /><br />Cheers!! :D
