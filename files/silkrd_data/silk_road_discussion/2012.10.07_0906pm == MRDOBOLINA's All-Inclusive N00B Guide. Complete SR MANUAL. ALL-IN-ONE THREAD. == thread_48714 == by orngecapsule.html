SCROLL DOWN FOR HIS EXPERT REVISONS, DETAILED ADDITIONS TO THIS GUIDE AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFORMATION written by a much more experienced roader whom I consider a true SR GURU</code><br />So here we go:<br /><br />1) THROUGH TOR go to www.blockchain.info set up an account (use a mailinator or any disposable email to register)<br /><br />2) Login to blockchain and click on &#039;Wallet&#039;<br /><br />3) Click on &#039;Receive Money&#039;. there you&#039;ll see your bitcoin address.&nbsp; (a bitcoin address looks something like this: 2tnMhKfSAf97f4wJcqTu6dr8toj6iaxy7y)<br /><br />4) Go to www.bitinstant.com&nbsp; &nbsp;(through TOR)<br />You&#039;ll see:<br />- Pay From: select &#039;Major Bank Branch&#039;<br />- Pay To: select &#039;Bitcoin Address&#039;<br />Underneath you&#039;ll see:<br />- Bitcoin Address: put your bitcoin address from Blockchain. best thing to do is simply COPY your bitcoin address from blockchain and PASTE it here.<br />- Amount: whatever your lovely heart desires<br />- Email: put in a random mailinator address<br /><br />5) You will now be directed to a Trustcash site.<br />- submit your zip code and click &#039;Choose Location&#039; for the closest bank to you<br />- enter a fake name. enter your mailinator email you used for Bitinstant<br />- click &quot;Create deposit invoice&quot;<br /><br />6) click &#039;Print Deposit Invoice&#039;<br />- you now have your paper printed out and ready to bring to the bank.<br />- this paper has NO information or details about your fake name, NO mention of anything bitcoin related.. absolutely NOTHING is on this paper but an account and routing number.<br /><br />7) Go to the bank with this printed paper and cash<br />- give the bank teller the paper. she will simply read the account and routing number off the paper and take your cash. then she&#039;ll probably give you back the paper and an invoice.<br />- if asked, simply say you&#039;re paying a bill. they never ask.. never happens.<br />- absolutely NO ID is required. if asked for it, grunt and say you never needed it before and you left it at home.. but they won&#039;t ask. just never happens.<br /><br />- remember paying bills at a bank is an everyday completely normal thing. millions of people go to banks daily depositing cash into people&#039;s or business&#039;s accounts for legitimate regular reasons.<br />- also remember buying bitcoins is LEGAL. <br /><br />That&#039;s it. the bitcoins will show up in your Blockchain wallet literally within minutes.<br /><br />theoretically you could send your bitcoins directly to SR now, but lets play it safe and &quot;launder&quot; your coins to blot out any sort of &quot;paper trail&quot;. The idea behind laundering your coins is obvious: erase the link between the coins and you. So don&#039;t be impatient / lazy. Follow these easy steps to guarantee your anonymity.<br /><br />1) Go to www.instawallet.org (through TOR) and it will give you your own personal secret site with your own unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose this link, you lose anything in it.<br />- instawallet is a temporary e-wallet. each time you refresh the site you receive a unique randomized bitcoin address and a new secret link.<br /><br />2) Now go back to your Blockchain wallet and click on &quot;Send Money&quot;<br />- simply enter your Instawallet bitcoin address and the amount<br />- Send payment<br /><br />Now your bitcoins have been sent from Blockchain to your Instawallet.<br /><br />The next 2 steps are optional and not necessary,&nbsp; can be skipped. BUT if you&#039;re meticulous and rightfully PARANOID like me, you should continue with the next 2 easy steps. If you don&#039;t give a fuck, go ahead and skip to step 5.<br /><br />3) Now open up a an Easywallet (through TOR) page, which will give you another unique bitcoin address. This is your second temporary e wallet address. (bookmark also)<br /><br />4) Send your bitcoins from your first Instawallet page to your Easywallet page.<br /><br />5) now go to SR, and click on Account<br />- there you&#039;ll see your SR bitcoin address<br /><br />6) Go to your Easywallet that has your coins, and simply enter your SR bitcoin address and press send!<br /><br />That&#039;s it, my darling friends!<br /><br />Just be patient and within a few HOURS or less you&#039;ll see your bitcoins in your SR account READY for your rascally crusades!<br /><br />If you&#039;re truly of the deranged, super paranoid kind you SHOULD use a site called BitcoinFog. It&#039;s a service that takes your coins and tumbles them to SHREDS, completely washing or BLEACHING them for several hours or even days. your coins are IMMACULATELY CLEAN.<br /><br />you can do that instead of the instawallet steps or in addition to them. depends on your level of paranoia.<br /><br />Some alternatives and different options:<br />- Some people skip Instawallet altogether and only use bitcoinfog alone which serves it&#039;s purpose just fine. Bitcoinfog is truly amazing.<br /><br />So to simplify the whole thing, you have many formulas to choose from:<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; bitcoin software &gt; bitcoinfog &gt; SR = EXCELLENT!<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; SR&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; considered safe, fast and secure. appropriate for most of us.<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet&nbsp; &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; good enough for some, not for me. fastest<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; = safer, slightly slower since you need to wait for bitcoinfog to do it&#039;s tumbling.<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; safest, ultra-paranoia stealth ninja mode, requires patience but provides the most peace of mind<br />- bitinstant &gt; Easywallet &gt; BitcoinFog &gt; SR = SAFEST also.<br /><br />As you can see, you have different options depending on your patience and paranoia level.<br /><br />Bonus useful tips:<br />1) When entering bitcoin addresses ALWAYS COPY PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long ass address. Always triple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination. <br /><br />2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example more than 1 week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as Easywallet or Instawallet. These temportary wallets are mostly useful for moving funds around. If you want to store your bitcoins somewhere for a long period of time use your Blockchain.info wallet or just keep all your bitcoins in your SR account. They will not disappear ever from there.<br /><br />3) ALWAYS ENCRYPT YOUR ADDRESS (PGP) when placing orders. vendors appreciate that.<br />some vendors state on their seller page listings that orders will be cancelled if the address is sent unencrypted.<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t use empty houses or drop locations to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that the vendors use professionally printed&nbsp; properly aligned labels with your address and name in all CAPS. If you&#039;re ordering small personal use amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much less risky than sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look for with these tricks. You can use your name slightly misspelled or altered. Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that lived / rented your place before.<br /><br />5) PGP is highly important. Never underestimate encryption for sensitive information. Encrypt your address when sending to vendors ALWAYS!<br />- scroll down to find links on how to learn what PGP is or it&#039;s purpose.<br /><br />6) - When you&#039;re required to FE, please take the time to update your feedback once you receive your items so others can read and learn from your experience. We hate seeing a vendor with all 5/5 feedback saying &quot;FE, will update later&quot; and no REVIEWS about the actual product.<br />To update your feedback, go to &#039;Account&#039; on SR and you&#039;ll see &#039;View Feedback&#039;. There you can modify / edit your feedback. Always think about the community and how to better serve / educate us all.<br /><br />Basic information about ESCROW, STATS AND FE:<br /><br />Another very important topic for noobs to UNDERSTAND: Your buying stats mean so fucking much for your survival in SR. If you&#039;re coming on here to scam vendors for free shit, you&#039;re a piece of shit and your stats will reflect that. Once you become part of SR, and you start purchasing your goodies, as a buyer you need to follow the SIMPLE procedure of SR&#039;s ESCROW system. That way everyone including you can continue to enjoy SR without unnecessary bullshit.<br /><br />The Escrow system is simple and brilliant. SR temporarily holds your money.. which means the vendor you are buying from does not receive your bitcoins UNTIL you receive your order. Once you receive your order you must click FINALIZE, then SR releases your bitcoins to the vendor. The escrow exists so both parties feel relatively safe and comfortable doing business with each other, preventing risk and satisfying both sides. The vendor is putting his profit on hold until you finalize the transaction, so you are responsible to make sure your vendor gets the money he DESERVES.<br /><br />The problem is a bunch of lowlifes decide to NOT finalize their orders, so these vendors are out on product and the coins they deserve. These kind of shitty buyers are causing more and more vendors to require FE (Finalizing Early).<br /><br />You will see the word FE tossed around a lot. FE means Finalize Early. That means your vendor will get your money before shipping your product. The risk is all on your side in that case. That is why we all hate having to FE because of the slight risk to us. Theoretically a shithead vendor can decide NOT to ship your product(s) after you&#039;ve FE&#039;d. Technically he is paid in full and it all comes down to trusting the vendor&#039;s reputation. Some vendors require buyers with less than 5-10 successful transactions to FE. Or a vendor could request FE for an international order. All depends on the vendor, the listing and circumstances. <br /><br />*Added by grahamgreene: &quot;Buyers are NEVER required to FE. Finalizing Early is the choice of the buyer - it is important for new users to realize that they are NOT required to FE under any circumstances. If a vendor will not sell to them without FE, they can choose to use a vendor that does not require FE. This is an agorist marketplace, not a fascist marketplace.<br />On the topic of FE, if one does choose to do so they are not forced to leave feedback there and then. After clicking &#039;Finalize&#039;, they simply need to click on any link to take them away from item feedback page, and they then leave their feedback when they receive their item so as people don&#039;t see a load of &quot;FE&quot; feedbacks.&quot;<br /><br />- Never finalize early for anyone but the top 20 vendors I’d say.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Read reviews on the forum before jumping in.<br /><br />The reason some vendors want FE is because of a few rotten pieces of shits that abuse the noble, rewarding Escrow System that really makes SR a satisfying stress-free place to do business.<br /><br />That is precisely why your STATS mean everything on SR. Once your stats show you are a reliable hassle-free buyer you can avoid having to FE. Remember that vendors screen your stats just like you screen their feedback / reviews.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a shitty buyer vendors will simply deny serving you or make you FE. Plus you&#039;re a scumbag.<br />If you&#039;re a good buyer with good stats vendors will allow you to stay within escrow, and if you&#039;re lucky you might even get some special treatment / perks. So work on being a good buyer if you&#039;re happy with your goods / services received.<br /><br />We have this ridiculously unbelievable BLESSING to buy any drug imaginable with a few clicks, like shopping on amazon. Instead of dealing with shady lowlife street dealers, we get to shop for our goodies in a sophisticated way, knowing precisely what you&#039;re getting, with detailed descriptions about purity, brand names, and all the knowledge we need to make educated, safe purchases. Instead of relying on the word from moron street dealers that can&#039;t give you any of these luxuries. This is SOMETHING valuable we need to cherish and MAINTAIN. <br /><br />So respect the Escrow system, that&#039;s there to CONSOLE you, respect SR&#039;s conduct, and HONOR THE HARMONY.. so we can keep this thing going forever. So we can have easier honest transactions with vendors. And so we can show gratitude to SR and the community.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Same principles applies to the vendors. <br />Mostly we have honorable vendors that work hard to get their good feedback and reputation. They provide us with good quality gear and professional customer service. There are also few scumbag vendors selling garbage or selective scamming. The way our stats matter to vendors, their feedback and forum reviews immensely matter to us. We expect remarkable, premium quality product and top notch service. We set our standards high and there are many wonderful vendors that can accommodate our refined cravings and experienced palettes with GOOD SHIT. Those vendors get the well deserved 5/5 feedback and have the forums buzzing like crazy spreading the word..<br /><br />When you&#039;re looking for a vendor, besides the obvious best selling listings that dominate the first pages, search the forums for more detailed in depth reviews..<br />You can find each drug has it&#039;s &quot;vendor review thread&quot;.&nbsp; Those threads are packed with amazing posts by amazing people. Here in the forun you can find out about new vendors just setting up shop with OUTSTANDING products. So use these forums to find the hidden gems, new vendors that have FIRE shit, that want your business so their feedback can grow. <br /><br />Lets say your order doesn&#039;t arrive or something went wrong, that is what the RESOLVE button is for. That will prompt a mini chat type interface between you and the vendor allowing some back-n-forth discussion regarding partial or full refunds, reships, or anything else that might remedy the problem. Good vendors truly care about their customers so before starting a thread bashing a vendor or giving negative feedback, message him/her first or go through the RESOLVE process to hopefully find a suitable solution.<br />Don&#039;t make a habit of asking for refunds unless it us truly genuinely necessary. Because REMEMBER: having too many refunds, or a reoccurring unusual patterns of problematic complaints will negatively affect your stats!<br /><br />SCAMMERS, ETC:<br />Here on SR we are a special well-bred, noble breed of sophisticated drug user, defying all logic and stigma that the typical drug user carries.. we try our best to maintain the MUTUAL RESPECT and courtesy between vendor and buyer. <br />unfortunately there will always be pieces of shits trying to run cons and scam. whether it&#039;s on SR, or in the streets. in the streets at least we&#039;re able to toss medium sized bricks directly towards their chins or jaw, but here we have something else.<br /><br />This is very important to UNDERSTAND: scamming and any monkey business doesn&#039;t fly here. If you have any shitty intentions I&#039;ll clearly explain why you SHOULDN&#039;T EVEN DARE OR ATTEMPT TO SCAM, or play games with vendors:<br /><br />The vendors have their own private forum. In their forum they have a BLACKLIST of BANNED CUSTOMERS that all vendors monitor and post in regularly. Once you&#039;re in this list you&#039;re fucked.<br />Any buyer on here attempting to scam, not finalize their orders, score free drugs, or ANY other types of remotely shady / scummy bullshit acts, will simply be ADDED and permanently LOGGED into this infamous BLACKLIST DATABASE of customers NEVER to deal with. But wait, not only your username will be posted but your NAME AND ADDRESS too!<br />even if you re register new SR accounts, your address / name will still be on this list. This is to truly keep these shameless, thieving scoundrels / rodents away from our loving community.<br /><br />There you have it!<br /><br />Eat your vegetables, take your multivitamin and stay hydrated always.<br /><br />love,<br />mrdobolina

				GRAHAMGREEN TO THE RESCUE! AMAZINGLY WRITTEN REVISIONS, AND INCREDIBLY DETAILED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />-----------------<br />One of our brilliant, more experienced superstar posters &#039; GRAHAMGREENE &#039;, expanded, clarified and properly CORRECTED some of the info from my guide above. He truly explains the steps mentioned above, with very well-written detailed information that will educate you beyond the basic steps. THIS INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WILL GIVE YOUR FURTHER INSIGHT:<br />---------<br /><br />It should be noted that Mt.Gox only freezes your account when you access it via TOR, but funds will be released once you verify your identity with them; it is possible to gain access to your funds in Mt.Gox, but you have to give up your anonymity to do so. If this happens, verify your identity, retrieve your Bitcoin, then tumble the fuck out of them in order to remove any links to the Bitcoin you bought on Mt.Gox and the Bitcoin you send to SR. There is nothing illegal about buying Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use them or any method of payment to buy illegal drugs.<br /><br />blockchain.info, like all online wallets, can not be trusted 100%. There is no guarantee that they won&#039;t run off with your Bitcoin at any time. The safest place for your Bitcoin is in your Bitcoin client on your own computer, encrypted and backed up regularly. There are guides on how to do this on the Bitcoin wiki:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Go to www.instawallet.org and it will give you your own personal secret site with your own unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose this link, you lose anything in it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Note: Make sure it&#039;s instawallet.ORG, with .org in the end.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- instawallet is a temporary e-wallet. each time you refresh the site you receive a unique randomized bitcoin address and a new secret link.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- we are using instawallet to move our bitcoins around, obscuring and fogging up the footprints. that is laundering or &quot;washing&quot; bitcoins<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3) Now open up a another Instawallet page, which will give you another unique bitcoin address. This is your second Instawallet address. (bookmark also)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4) Send your bitcoins from your first Instawallet page to your second Instawallet address.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As E-Wallets use an internal transfer process, they do &#039;tumble&#039; or &#039;launder&#039; your Bitcoin in a sense, but it would not be prudent to rely on E-Wallets alone for tumbling purposes. Read more about anonymity and staying anonymous here:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re truly of the deranged, extremely super paranoid kind you can ALSO use a site called bitcoin fog. It&#039;s a free service that takes your coins and tumbles them to death, completely washing or BLEACHING them for a few hours. once it&#039;s done your coins are IMMACULATELY CLEAN.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;you can do that instead of the instawallet steps or in addition to them. depends on your level of paranoia.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is advisable to tumble all Bitcoin that you don&#039;t want traced back to you. Not necessary, but advisable.<br />BitcoinFog is not a free service:<br />The service takes 1%-3% (randomized for obscurity) fee on each deposit.<br />No other fees are in place, no complex calculations based on the number of withdraws or similar.<br />Minimum withdraw amount is 1.00 BTC.<br /><br />The method to use BitcoinFog securely is below, taken directly from their clearnet website (www.bitcoinfog.com):<br />After a couple of network confirmations, your money is registered on your Fog account, and you can schedule withdrawals. Each withdrawal will be split in a random number of payouts, depending on the amount, and the relative size of each payout will be randomized as well. Even the timing of those payouts will be randomly spread out over a period of time you will specify.<br /><br />Ideally you should deposit an amount of bitcoins to the Fog, wait some time (which will depend on how many users are using the service, right now in the starting phase we recommend a week) and request a withdrawal, which will not have the same amount as the original deposit, leaving some funds in the Fog.<br /><br />Then you should deposit another batch of bitcoins and withdraw yet another amount, again different from the amount you have deposited. This time it can be lower than deposited, or higher, adding the funds you have left from the previous deposit. This way there is no practically reliable way to do statistical analysis on the block chain and link your deposits to your withdrawals.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Bonus useful tips:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1) When entering bitcoin addresses ALWAYS COPY PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long ass address. Always triple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination. Imagine sending 100 BTC to a bitcoin address that has 1 wrong digit or letter.. you&#039;re fucked.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Whilst it seems better to copy and paste your Bitcoin address, there have been cases in the past whereby the person was sending Bitcoin to a certain address by copying and pasting the address into the necessary fields, but due to their computer being compromised, they pasted a different Bitcoin address. What this exploit did was change the address on the clipboard once it had been copied, and when the user pasted the Bitcoin address into their client or E-Wallet, they were actually pasting the attacker&#039;s address. As you said, you should triple check you have the right address, but verify it visually with first, middle and last 4 digits before hitting the send button.<br />bitcoin-qt, the computer based client, doesn&#039;t allow you to send to an address shorter than 34 characters - I&#039;m unsure if E-Wallets do the same, but I would assume so as transfers can&#039;t be sent to an address shorter than 34 characters, unless you input 4 or 5 characters of a first-bit address.<br /><br />It would also be prudent after hitting &quot;Get a new address&quot; in both your Bitcoin client and your SR account to check that address on blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to ensure it has never been used on the network before. Though it is a statistical improbability, that very thing actually happened to me when I set up a new receiving address in my client. For some reason I checked the address before I bought my Bitcoin and noticed that it had been used 2 years ago - before I&#039;d even heard of Bitcoin.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example more than 1 week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as Easywallet or Instawallet.

All Tormail emails and draft emails are stored in plain-text on their servers, and you are placing your trust in a third party not to reveal your information the way hushmail.com did. Tormail have records of your username and password - all they are missing is your IP address. When sending mail with Tormail ALWAYS ensure that sensitive information is encrypted. Again, just as with SR, do NOT trust the system.<br />The best place to store your information is in your head. If you can&#039;t do that, store them in a double or triple encrypted file on a memory stick or SD card. I won&#039;t go into encryption here but search the forums and you&#039;ll find all the information you need to run a secure setup.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4) Don&#039;t use empty houses or drop locations to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that the vendors use professionally printed&nbsp; properly aligned labels with your address and name in all CAPS. If you&#039;re ordering small personal use amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much less risky than sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look for with these tricks. You can use your name slightly misspelled or altered. Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that lived / rented your place before.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I personally have never received any mail with my name and address in capital letters - others may have, so my word on this point should not be taken as gospel, but I would imagine that most business mail is sent with the customer&#039;s name and address in lowercase, with capitalisation only used in the necessary places. Some postal services did recommend in the past that details be in caps so as the machine could read it more easily, but with the advent of modern scanning technology this is no longer a necessity, and I believe it would make the letter / package stand out amongst your other mail.<br /><br />Never misspell or alter your name. You want your order to blend in with your other mail as much as possible. Your mailman or mailwoman will notice a misspelled name; the first time they may shrug it off, but if the see it repeatedly they may think something is up.<br />Put it this way: if you were ordering something from the likes of Amazon or ebay, wouldn&#039;t you be sure to spell your name correctly? Your mail has to look like any other online purchase. Some people try to combine a misspelled name with a &quot;someone&#039;s trying to frame me&quot; excuse. If someone were trying to frame you with drugs that they likely spent money on, it&#039;ll be someone that has a vendetta against you. You can be damn sure they&#039;ll Facebook or Google you to ensure they spell your name correctly so the &quot;Look, they spelled my name wrong, I&#039;m being framed!&quot; excuse goes out the window.<br /><br />Using the name of a previous tenant is risky as they may have set up mail forwarding. Some people still receive mail for previous tenants, but mail forwarding doesn&#039;t always forward all mail (junkmail etc. is often still sent to the tenant&#039;s previous address.) By doing this, you risk your purchase being forwarded to the ex-tenant.<br />Best case scenario: they use drugs and think it&#039;s awesome that someone sent them a freebie.<br />Worst case scenario: they receive a package of drugs or white powder in the mail and immediately call the police who see your address on the package as it was forwarded, thereby putting your address on their radar.<br /><br />ALWAYS use your real name and real address for orders. Some have had success with P.O. boxes opened up with fake ID&#039;s. I have no experience with that though so I can&#039;t comment on it - again, a search of the forums will throw up threads with the necessary information.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Lets say your order doesn&#039;t arrive or something went wrong, that is what the RESOLVE button is for.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just wanted to add a bit here about Resolution and Auto-Finalization:<br /><br />If your order has not arrived after about 13 days, hit the Resolve button. This will take your order to the Resolution Center, as orngecapsule has already outlined. Here you will be given the option of asking the vendor for a refund, asking for a re-ship, extending the time-frame for your order to reach you or come to some other agreement with your vendor. Personally, I always extend by another 5 - 7 days because the postal service, whilst usually fairly efficient, does occasionally take longer than expected. If needs-be, I will extend again.<br /><br />The initial time extension begins at the end of the 17 day period (when your vendor marks your order as &#039;in transit&#039;, it will be 17 days before the order auto-finalizes) so if you enter resolution on day 13 and offer a 7 day extension, it will be 11 days (the 4 days left out of the 17 day period, plus the 7 days you&#039;re extending by) before it comes the attention of Resolution Center administrators again. You can ask to change the terms of resolution at any time, and you can also Finalize at any time if your product has arrived and the Resolution process will automatically be closed.<br /><br />Always enter Resolution a couple of days before the auto-finalization date. One of the things vendors hate most is expecting their money after the 17 day period, only for the buyer to enter resolution and propose an extension 2 hours before auto-finalization. If you haven&#039;t logged in for a few days and it IS a couple of hours before finalization, hit &#039;resolve&#039; and explain in the note section that you hadn&#039;t logged in, apologize for entering resolution so close to the auto-finalization date and propose a time extension. Once an order is in the resolution center it will not auto-finalize.<br /><br />If a % refund is requested and the amount of the refund is disputed by the vendor, the matter will be settled by the administrator dealing with the resolution. If the vendor has a specific refund policy, then you have agreed to that upon ordering and that is the refund that you will receive, if any. If the vendor can produce a DCN proving that the item in question was sent, then the proof backs up the vendor and SR will usually side with them. However, the reputation of both the member and the vendor and their respective Purchasing / Selling stats will also weigh in on the administrator&#039;s decision.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quote from: orngecapsule on September 28, 2012, 04:46 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1) When you&#039;re required to FE, you&#039;re forced to leave feedback before receiving your product. Most people just write: &quot;FE, will update when arrives&quot; but they never actually update that feedback. Please take the time to update your feedback once you receive your items so others can read and learn from your experience. We hate seeing a vendor with all 5/5 feedback saying &quot;FE, will update later&quot; and no REVIEWS about the actual product.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To update your feedback, go to &#039;Account&#039; on SR and you&#039;ll see &#039;View Feedback&#039;. There you can modify / edit your feedback. Always think about the community and how to better serve us all.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On the topic of FE, if one does choose to Finalize Early they are not forced to leave feedback there and then. After clicking &#039;Finalize&#039;, they simply need to click on any link to take them away from item feedback page, and they can then leave their feedback when they receive their item. This prevents a load of &quot;FE, will update when received&quot; etc. feedbacks on the vendor&#039;s page.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br />

This is easier than it sounds: a private key is 256 bits long, so it is about as hard to memorize as 50 words of English prose or 10 phone numbers, although you can settle for even less than that at the expense of some security.<br /><br />There are three ways to create a brain wallet. The first, and most obvious, is to create an address/private key pair with bitaddress.org, blockchain.info or vanitygen and memorize it as is. However, this option is the most difficult to memorize. The second is to generate an address/private key pair and use a tool like Grondilu’s Bitcoin Bash Tools or the Electrum wallet to generate a list of words from the private key which you can more easily memorize, and then use the tool to convert back when you need to. The third is to do the reverse – create the private key from the passphrase, which you can choose yourself. Since almost any 256-bit value can be used as a private key with Bitcoin’s ECDSA cryptography, you can take the SHA256 hash of any password or phrase (the tools for this are very widely available both online and offline) and then import the result into the blockchain.info wallet in offline mode to get the address for that key. The process for sending bitcoins is exactly the same as that for offline/paper wallets: use a tool to create the transaction offline, and then use an online computer to publish it.<br /><br />Read about brainwallets here:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet<br />http://bitcoinmagazine.net/brain-wallets-the-what-and-the-how/<br /><br /><br />INTERNATIONAL - How to get Bitcoins<br />(ONLY VISIT THROUGH TOR)<br />-----------------------------------<br />https://bitmarket.eu/<br /><br />WorldBitcoinExchange.com - Australia<br /><br />https://bitpiggy.herokuapp.com/ - Australia<br /><br />https://bitcoil.co.il/ - Israel<br /><br />http://metabank.ru/ - Russia<br /><br />http://bitcoinbrasil.blogspot.com/ - Brasil<br /><br />http://www.btc-direct.fr/ - France<br /><br />https://btcchina.com/ - China<br /><br />https://bitcoinnordic.com/ - Denmark<br /><br />https://kapiton.se/ - Sweden<br /><br />http://www.bitcoin-exchanger.com/ - Russia<br /><br />http://bitmarket.co/ - Columbia<br /><br />http://cavirtex.com/ - Canada<br /><br />http://www.bitcoin-austria.at/ - Austria<br /><br />http://bitnz.com/ - New Zealand<br /><br />http://bitcoins.aunz.ws/ - Australia<br /><br />https://www.virwox.com/ - Designed for International customers<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />OTHER USEFUL LINKS - DARKNET + CLEARNET:&nbsp; &nbsp;(ONLY VISIT THROUGH TOR)<br /><br />http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page - CLEAN HIDDEN WIKI<br /><br />http://ay5kwknh6znfmcbb.onion/torsquare/ - TORSQUARE <br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/ - Onion image upload<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18159.0 - ALL THE BIG CLEARNET VENDORS FOR RC&#039;S<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45678.msg487388#msg487388 - INTERESTING ONION SITES<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page - OFFICIAL SILK ROAD WIKI<br /><br />c4wcxidkfhvmzhw6.onion - PrivacyBox - (anonymous messaging service)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#The_Latest_Rumors - OFFICIAL [Insert Drug Here] VENDOR TOPICS<br /><br />https://safeorscam.com/ - The most accurate and reliable site for verifying the legitimacy and reliability of (clearnet) vendors worldwide.<br /><br />http://www.legalhighguides.com/ - FORUM DEDICATED TO RC AND &quot;LEGAL HIGH DISCUSSION<br /><br />https://get-bitcoin.com/<br /><br />http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/ - INTELEXCHANGE<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/badtornodes/&nbsp; InspecTor<br /><br /><br />OTHER MARKETS:<br /><br />5m7hvoukd75r7hn3.onion&nbsp; - The Armory Reloaded, the new armory<br /><br />xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/armoryreloaded/&nbsp; - The Armory Reloaded (alternative website)<br /><br />xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/synaptic/ -- Team Synaptic&#039;s new webshop<br /><br />5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion&nbsp; - Black Market Reloaded - another anonymous marketplace<br /><br />http://7v2i3bwsaj7cjs34.onion/ - TORBlackmarket<br /><br />MISC:<br /><br />3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion - DuckDuckGo - search engine<br /><br />ocrlwkklxt3ud64u.onion - TOR file upload service<br /><br />dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion - Tor Dir - a categorized index of .onion services available on TOR.

				MORE GENERAL INFORMATION AND GATHERED RESEARCH:<br /><br />If you are worried enough about your security to be using PGP, than you should most definitely not being using&nbsp; windows to access the silk road or any other part of the darknet.<br />for one example of one of the many dangers of using windows, there is a thread around here about how windows 7 (and possibly other versions) keeps a constant 10mb/s encrypted connection with the NSA. and although it is not know what that connection is sending, a lot of signs point to complete surveillance of everything yhat you do on the machine. That alone should be enough to make any SR user fear windows. And some people (myself included) believe that Mac systems have similar issues<br /><br />You should really be using a linux LiveUSB to access SR. Not only is it a million times safer, but the PGP programs in the ones designed for anonymity are much easier to use than gpg4win, and it pretty much already set up for you.<br /><br />follow the instructions here to make a Tails Linux LiveUSB (one of the more favored LiveUSBs among SR users):<br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/windows/index.en.html<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />There seem to be two school of thoughts on your computer security OS wise:<br />&nbsp;<br />Using a linux CD/usb to boot up into a “live” environment. Full virtualization and isolation of all network facing applications found here: <br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/secureconfig/tutorial.html - Secure OpenBSD Configuration<br /><br />If you are into CLI here is it done in the terminal:<br />http://howtoxyz.blogspot.com/2008/07/generate-your-gpg-key.html<br /><br />--<br /><br />TIPS FROM OTHER FORUM POSTERS:<br /><br />opentoe&#039;s advice:<br />The ONLY way I access SR or anything to do with it is using MS VirtualPC. The entire OS is encapsulated in one big VM file. I think it is better then a USB card since I can lose that or someone can take it. If I have to ditch my VM quickly I can just delete the entire VM itself. Then I can use SDELETE multiple times on my drive. Then I&#039;m safe. Now, if the ever chance I got busted on and charged through my door i may have a hard time doing all that. This is why I created a batch file which I just double click on that will erase the VM and run sdelete automatically. There are also hard drive killer programs out there that I may check out too. Also, when you communicate private/sensitive information ALWAYS use PGP. If you don&#039;t know how to use it, then LEARN IT. Never use a vendor that doesn&#039;t at least provide it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Delta11&#039;s advice:<br />Secure Tor Setup:<br />-Install TAILS on a usb stick or a cd if you&#039;re paranoid that you might leave data on the usb (cd is read-only)<br />-Get a second usb/memory card and encrypt it using truecrypt but make sure to encrypt with a hidden partition.<br />-Select an easy/crackable password for the outer volume and then make the password for the hidden partition very strong/secure.<br />-On your outer volume put embarrassing things (Pictures of your ex, naked pics of dudes, etc) that way if you&#039;re ever forced to decrypt your drive you&#039;ll just facepalm and say &quot;Okay you found my secret you asshole.&quot;<br />-On your hidden partition keep all of your sensitive info and make sure to even PGP text files just in case.<br />-Try to connect to a neighbor&#039;s wifi, chances are there are some unsecured ones. If there aren&#039;t any unsecured networks then check to see if any of them are locked with WEP, they are easy to crack but you&#039;ll have to figure that out on your own. <br /><br />---<br /><br />pine&#039;s advice:<br />Go onto Tor and download bitcoin wallet software -&gt;&nbsp; Printscreen http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor instructions -&gt; Turn off interweb -&gt; Install and torify your bitcoin wallet software -&gt; Turn on interweb and download the block chain to torified bitcoin wallet, now you are ready to proceed -&gt; On clearnet, access your exchange account with the bitcoins -&gt; Make an instawallet/online bitcoin wallet provider account through clearnet -&gt; transfer bitcoins from exchange to instawallet -&gt; transfer from instawallet to your torified bitcoin wallet -&gt; Open new instawallet with Tor -&gt; transfer from torified bitcoin wallet to instawallet on Tor -&gt; Optionally transfer to a bitcoin mixing service -&gt; wait a couple of hours/days -&gt; transfer from mixing service or online wallet to SR.<br /><br />--<br />pkinkman&#039;s advice:<br />If you have access to cash now and went to make a purchase today here&#039;s the easiest way:<br /><br />1. Buy Moneypak. (Up to $300&nbsp; at 7-11 or $1100 at Wallmart)<br />2. Purchase BTC from SR vendor with MoneyPak, ideally Coinbox as his fee is only 1-2%. &quot;BTC Buddy&quot; is also reliable exchanger although his 10% is more than I would pay. Not sure what Vlad charges but you should PM any of these vendors to work out a rate.<br />3. Buy drugs of choice with funds from your freshly topped up SR btc account.<br />4. Wait in agony while anticipating the arrival of your freshly purchased drugs.<br />5. Do drugs.<br /><br /><br />MORE ADVICE:<br />1. Don&#039;t have your clearnet browser and Tor browser open at the same time.<br />2. Never use a Bitcoin address more than once.<br />3. Search forum for bitcoin mixing services and online bitcoin wallet providers.<br />4. If you think you see flaws, you point them out. The only stupid question is one never asked.<br />5. Although the above procedures might make you more paranoid, you should really sleep a whole lot sounder since every service you&#039;ve used from the exchange to the Silk Road itself could be compromised and it wouldn&#039;t matter a whole lot.<br />6. Clearnet means being on the normal web and you&#039;re not using Tor software. Darknet is the opposite.<br />7. To torify something means that its internet traffic is being routed though the Tor network.<br />8. Don&#039;t access exchange websites with Tor, period. Unless you&#039;re doing what I described above<br />9. Don&#039;t access any website with Tor e.g. your instawallet, and then access the same web address/URL using Tor. Now instawallet knows who you are if you do.<br />10. Under no circumstances, none, forward bitcoins from A to B and then put the bitcoins back into a wallet you used earlier. This is circumstantial evidence that all bitcoin activity in that loop belongs to a single entity.<br />11. The larger the quantities being transacted, the more you want to be thinking about ferrying varying amounts of bitcoin over time with different Tor identities. I believe there is bitcoin software that can do this for you, future scheduled deposits that is, and your Tor software periodically changes identity anyway.<br /><br /><br />--<br />MISC ALTERNATIVE ADVICE #1:<br /><br />The best practice is to treat Bitcoin like a bank with multiple accounts. You find a secure machine, whether it&#039;s a Linux LiveCD or whatever and create a new wallet. Write down the address. Encrypt the wallet (using Truecrypt or whatever else) and put it on a USB stick. Hell, make two USB sticks.<br /><br />Throw it in your safe. Keep another elsewhere. Treat it like a huge pile of cash you can keep backups of, but no one can really steal.<br /><br />Keep a secondary wallet on your PC. Think of it as your checking account. Once you have an uncomfortable amount of funds, or before that point, transfer some of it off to your primary wallet (your savings account).<br /><br />What will be useful after this is to get a Bitcoin Linux LiveCD specifically for accessing your primary wallet. If you need to access your 25,000BTC stash, you boot from that LiveCD, pop in your USB stick, and do your business.<br /><br />That&#039;s the only way you&#039;re ever going to have real security with your Bitcoin funds<br /><br />--<br />MISC ALTERNATIVE ADVICE #2:<br /><br />- Acquire a cheap netbook/pc/toaster, the &#039;cleaner&#039; the better, i.e. new in box is best. NEVER CONNECT THIS MACHINE TO THE NET<br />- Acquire some flash/external hds/printer/cd burner or other long term storage/backup media usable from your Bitty Bank.<br />- Use the media you got to put a verified copy of the bitcoin client on your Bitty Bank, generate a wallet. Back up this wallet using the media mentioned.<br />- Destroy your bitty bank, or at least give it a good strong wipe.<br /><br />YOU NOW HAVE A SECURE AIR-GAPPED ONE-WAY BITCOIN BANK<br /><br />And perhaps you also see why I term this the &#039;Bitty Bank&#039;. You can put funds in but not take them out until your ready to &#039;break&#039; it.<br /><br />To &#039;break&#039; your Bitty Bank, you have to connect it to the net and send whatever money you want to withdrawal. Unfortunately at this point your Bitty Bank is potentially compromised. The trick, is that you can have a new secure Bitty Bank set up to receive the excess funds at the same make your desired withdrawal from busted bank.<br /><br />Why this should work From my understanding, it is not necessary for the Bitcoin recipient to come online within any given time-frame.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also observed that it is possible to create new wallets, without any net connection.<br /><br />Since Bitcoin is really just a distributed ledger, this makes a lot of sense, your not actually sending anything to the recipient, your just logging that you want that person to have the concept of X.XX Bitcoin.<br /><br />This being the case, it is never necessary to have your wallet on a net-connected machine until you intend to send bitcoins.<br /><br />---<br />MISC ALTERNATIVE ADVICE #3:<br /><br />Pick a machine to dedicate to bitcoin. I will refer to this as &quot;bitbank&quot;. It doesn&#039;t need much in terms of hardware specs, just needs to run. The paranoid may wish to check for hardware keyloggers and such, but it shouldn&#039;t really matter, as you will be keeping it physically secure.<br /><br />Whip the HD and install a secure OS. Should be something secure and reliable. Debian would be a good choice. Use full disk encryption. This will serve more as a barrier against tampering with the software (eg installing software keyloggers) than protecting the data.<br /><br />Do not install any additional software on the computer, or even brows the web on it. Yes, it should be okay as long as you use reputable software, etc. But we are being paranoid here. There could be security flaws anywhere. Only use it for bitcoin<br /><br />Disable any &quot;dangerous&quot; software running on the machine. This is pretty much just ssh or other remote login software. I&#039;m pretty sure this isn&#039;t an issue in Debian, but I haven&#039;t done a desktop install for a while.<br /><br />Install bitcoin. Use official repos when possible, since this should be a signed package.<br /><br />** Use your new bitbank.** Just send coins to it&#039;s address when you want, start it up only when you want to remove coins. Monitor the distro&#039;s site for any crucial security updates and do them, but other than that you are good.<br /><br />Keep it physically secure. No software protects you against an attacker planting a hardware keylogger in your machine. A safe or bank vault would be a good idea.<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />MISC TIPS:<br /><br />If you had sensitive data on HDD and moved it to encrypted volume, make sure to erase all the data with<br />http://www.killdisk.com/ or Eraser http://eraser.heidi.ie/<br />Both are free.<br /><br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />BASIC TERMINOLOGY:<br /><br />BITCOIN WALLET - A Bitcoin client is a piece of software that handles receiving and sending bitcoins. The most popular is the standard Bitcoin client downloadable from bitcoin.org, although there are many other options with different features.<br /><br />The term wallet can have two meanings: it can either be a synonym for a Bitcoin client (although the terms are in practice used slightly differently, “client” referring more to fully fledged desktop clients and “wallet” more to lightweight browser-based and online managed services) or it can refer to a file which stores bitcoin addresses and the private keys needed to use them.<br /><br />BITCOIN ADDDRESS - A Bitcoin address is a string like “13ignD31FysQbaBBVJUzffcQoFxxEuEcbE” that you need to know from someone to send bitcoins to them. The process of creating a bitcoin address and the private key going along with it can be done by bitcoin clients.<br /><br />PRIVATE KEY - A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a key connected to an address (technically, the address is the hash of the public key corresponding to the private key) that is stored behind the scenes and allows you to send bitcoins that have been previously sent to that address. Note that because of the way the encryption algorithm that Bitcoin uses (ECDSA) works it is possible to generate the public key and the address from just the private key.<br /><br />
