				Did you do anything illegal on that site?<br /><br />Did you do anything that could link you to illegal activity (eg, mentioning Silk Road)?<br /><br />If no, you&#039;ll be fine.<br />

				You are not too fucked so don&#039;t worry about it. <br /><br />You have any idea just how hard it is to see what people do on tor. You would have to be very naughty indeed for anyone to try. So unless you are a drug kingpin, distributing cp or a terrorist you can relax.

				Yeah people are often WAY to paranoid around here. Not to say that you shouldn&#039;t be very very cautious. But really, even if you ordered 1/2 of heroin from a DEA agent online, if you haven&#039;t sent any money and haven&#039;t received any heroin, there is no real crime for the to arrest you for.<br /><br />mm

				You&#039;re fine, so long as you&#039;re not a big time dealer with the cops already monitoring you, in which case you&#039;d be fucked anyway.<br />Chill out, smoke a J and just be more careful next time.
