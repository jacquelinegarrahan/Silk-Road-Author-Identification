				SPANISH police have seized 11 tonnes of hashish smuggled from Morocco on trucks with fuel tanks rigged to hide the drugs and arrested 35 people in what has been described as the breakup of a major smuggling ring feeding the European market.<br /><br />The haul was displayed across a patio outside the headquarters of the National Police, with some hashish packaged in small amounts resembling bars of soap, while much of it was held in suitcases made out of tape and packaging material.<br /><br />It was described as one of Spain&#039;s biggest drug seizures, but officials did not provide details of previous confiscations for comparison purposes.<br /><br />Authorities said the hashish travelled in trucks that took cargo ferries from Morocco to southern Spain, and were then driven to a Madrid suburb where the hashish was extracted from the vehicles&#039; fuel tanks. From there, some of the hashish was sent to Madrid for sale while the rest was put aboard other trucks carrying legal merchandise to countries including Belgium, Britain, France and Holland.<br />Those arrested included 31 Moroccans, three Spaniards and a Belgian woman. One of the Spaniards and the Belgian woman were truckers driving rigs with loads of carrots and clothing with the hashish hidden amid the legitimate cargo, National Police chief Ignacio Cosido said.<br /><br />Cosido declined to put a value on the hashish seized except to say &quot;it&#039;s very profitable&quot;.<br /><br />Police in 17 raids also seized numerous bags of marijuana, 150,000 euros ($A190,000) in cash, 14 vehicles valued at 400,000 euros and 109 mobile phones during the course of an eight-month investigation that started when authorities broke up a Madrid hashish selling ring and went after that group&#039;s suppliers.<br /><br />The ring used GPS systems to track the movements of their hashish loads, and the specially designed fuel tanks to hold the drugs were put back together again for reuse after being dismantled, said Jose Luis Conde, who heads the National Police&#039;s Madrid division.<br /><br />Conde declined to say whether the hashish originally came from Morocco, a major producer, saying only that it was from North Africa.<br /><br />&nbsp;-- Clearnet: http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/spain-seizes-11-tonnes-of-hashish/story-e6freoo6-1226543846744

				In other news:<br /><br />Marion County man charged with having sex with miniature donkey<br /><br />Marion County Sheriff’s Office responded to a local farm when a man reported he was delivering a horse to the farm he rents and noticed all the lights were off in the barn except for one of the tack rooms being used as sleeping quarters by Carlos Romero. As the witness walked past the tack room he looked in the window and observed Romero and Romero&#039;s miniature female donkey in the tack room together. The witness stated the Romero did not have a shirt on and his pants were down. Romero was up against the rear of the donkey and it appeared that he was having sex with the donkey.<br /><br />When Romero noticed the witness looking through the window he pulled away from the donkey and pulled up his pants. He then opened the door, pushed the donkey out of the room, and closed the door.<br /><br />Romero told investigators he uses his fingers and saliva to clean the donkey&#039;s private area and checks for wood shavings and debris. He also stated every 21 days the donkey goes into heat and that he gets aroused seeing an animal in heat and watching animals mate.<br /><br />Romero claimed he stands behind the donkey, scratches her withers and masturbates. He admitted he likes the way the fur feels on his genitalia and “his semen may have<br />splattered inside the donkey by accident”.<br /><br />Romero recalls masturbating with the donkey 5 or 6 times, and then declared Florida is a backwards state and people frown on zoophilia here.
