				Topic.&nbsp; I have noticed a very substantial drop in prices of Canadian MDMA in the 9+ months that I have been on SR.&nbsp; I believe the US prices have dropped but nearly as much.&nbsp; I am curious if you guys expect to see a substantial drop in the price of US MDMA on SR this year or not.<br /><br />I would love to hear people&#039;s estimates.&nbsp; I typically buy 50g orders from Canada for around $1200-1500 and it seems like US prices are about 180-200% as much.&nbsp; It would be nice to see 50g orders for under $1800 or so by Fall but I&#039;m not getting my hopes up.&nbsp; International customs always stresses me out (even between Canada and the US) so it&#039;d be nice to be able to get quick and less-seizable orders domestically.

				Seems unlikely. Stiffer penalties = higher risk = need for more money per order. It also appears harder to get precursors into the US for whatever reason.

				The border between the us an can is so vast it seems like between air, water, and land it would be pretty easy to make a substantial amount land in the USA without having to ship it through customs where there is a 50/50 chance it would be caught. Im surprised no one has thought about how to make that happen as it seems like there is a pretty lucrative market for it in the usa.

But when you start crossing seas to teh states of Australia it gets way more difficult. <br /><br />People want payed more to do it, so everyone gets charged more - from the big time dealer, to the personal buyer. <br /><br />Unless someone smart/brave (possibly insane) forms some kind of EU sized operation in the states and offers EU pricing, then you&#039;ll always be paying a little more sadly.

				Also the club / rave scene in the US in nowhere near the size of that in Europe.<br /><br />Less demand = less people making the product = higher prices.<br /><br />Plus yeah, US penal laws are horrible, no wonder people dont want to get involved in manufacturing.

				Vendors have probably reached their low for what they are gonna charge for MDMA.<br /><br />Prices in Canada for real MDMA have been increasing the last 1 - 2 years ... so while kg&#039;s used to be 3500-4000 for good stuff back in 2011, its about triple that now.<br /><br />With the costs of bitcoins, SR fees and the costs associated with keeping a tight operation, the risk isnt really worth it to sell 600/oz
