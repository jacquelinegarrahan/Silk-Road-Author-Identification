				OK so here&#039;s the story...I needed a quick way to exchange ~$269.95 to BTC. So I&#039;ve read the Doublemint is a trusted guy, and many people have gone to him. So I figured why not trust this guy so I send him over my MP code and all. I get a response saying there&#039;s no money on it. So right now im like wtf..... I just checked the balance and it says 9.95 unlike what he said. What do I do? I can&#039;t check my sent messages for some reason to be absolutely sure I sent him the right code, but either way I am now missing $260... Any one care to help me figure this out?

				Definitely jumped the gun.....UNLESS you really have NO CHOICE....I would recommend not buying bitcoins on SR.&nbsp; There are some legit BTC vendors but I think you are taking a chance every time.&nbsp; IMO<br />&nbsp;<br />I see no way in getting your $$ back.&nbsp; Post your story in his other thread to alert others and keep all the complaints together in one place is better.&nbsp; Sorry you were scammed.....SUCKS.

				No one should buy BTC on SR considering the other options that are available. I always use a very simple method that I believe is open to anyone in the world. I make a deposit to my Dwolla account (this admittedly takes some time, around 5 days, but it&#039;s worth it for the security), followed by sending my new Dwolla balance to my Tradehill account, then I make a market order and have the bitcoins I need in minutes, and finally I send it all through several instawallets before finally sending it to my Silk Road account. It&#039;s that simple. And if you buy frequently, you can use Dwolla Instant which for a small monthly fee allows you to make deposits without waiting several days like the average user.

				Even the best intentioned MP to BTC vendor is going to have their work cut out for them avoiding MP&#039;s anti-laundering activities.&nbsp; To do any kind of volume they would have to literally have dozens of accounts to deal with MP&#039;s regional tracking and deposit limits.&nbsp; You trip MP&#039;s threshold and your funds get frozen for who knows how long.&nbsp; Just like paypal you do not see any established digital currency vendors with actual websites promoting it as a deposit option.<br />
