				i have been reading the PM&#039;s people have been getting that are scams and i received one i havnt seen mentioned that im assuming is a scam since its asking for money i have posted it below.<br /><br /><br />Update - 04/07/2013<br />« Sent to: repentant1 on: Today at 12:02 pm »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Delete<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Dear Silk Road community,<br /><br />A combination of bad luck, bad timing and lack of preparation has led to our forums being down over the last 72 hours or so.&nbsp; I am terribly sorry for any trouble this has caused you.&nbsp; The main market is equipped with a semi-automated backup and redeploy system to minimize this kind of down-time, but I hadn&#039;t gotten around to setting the forum up in that way, and this is the consequence.<br /><br />The cause of the downtime was not security related, nor was it caused by a malicious party.&nbsp; Sometimes technology just breaks, and because of the constraints from the nature of our business, it can take time to recover if proper precautions haven&#039;t been taken, or don&#039;t work as expected.<br /><br />They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, so hopefully we can enjoy each other&#039;s company even more now that we&#039;ve had some time apart.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*Important notice*<br />To keep up with the high demand of peoples withdrawals due to the fast changing BTC economy, I will be needing upto 1000 bitcoin to keep up with cashflow.<br />Anything you donate WILL be paid back upto DOUBLE within 2 days, either as giftcodes or back to the same address you paid from.<br /><br /><br />1EkpTb56atXkZT2fb4PRVdf1UeVGXJgKoU<br /><br /><br /><br />- -DPR<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJRP2BGAAoJEAIiQjtnt/ol2dgH/2zwGOBEP8tUzXSolozhGzCe<br />D8tMbTqwPiAVmhRc0bqvNTRfWvNFDXoeM9M8yoF05qvVhzWcBbJTgUNJWuYQuINI<br />HN8UHK1OpTfMlzyAqJq1FsKwRkodETpRMyzOYham6csFOWJ2dZd6/MYHEokjq36n<br />HWLxYHgJbKiqis5YDpVYz5i2whZ8ivqDzuOcQCN1g3PDlq0YYY46WOaNPpgqnigd<br />vzQA2tVGwg0QpS2M9LR4miw7iwQGQp/QAqYtqUXswUpKEiRWG2jcMmXqoGaEYf//<br />o0qkRna2TmdFgvfEqORn3ouQRYsmgEn7ddfXNp3QktClY8BHmvm/DPTVFiq0vgI=<br />=8t18<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />

				Welcome to the anonymous internet, where anyone can do anything and not get caught.&nbsp; Get used to this kind of thing, and even more legitimate sounding messages that include a product offer of some sort.&nbsp; Never send money to solicitors.&nbsp; And don&#039;t bother making a thread about this kind of thing next time. ;)<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				How come I&#039;m not smart enough to thnk up something as good as this?&nbsp; <br /><br />Damn the last scam muscled $70,000.&nbsp; &nbsp;In a day As Fucking if !<br /><br />Not that I want to scam people but , hey if some are willing to just hand it over so easily&nbsp; then hose are ok low hanging fruit.&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe many peoe here are mentally challenged.<br />&nbsp;<br />So , yes. There must be many easy to trick people here.&nbsp; I think good judgment goes out the window when you are high on drugs.&nbsp; You get all excited when you get a new message from a vendor or staff or DPR.&nbsp; &nbsp;so you&#039;ll do whatever they ask in the message.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t kiss ass.&nbsp;
