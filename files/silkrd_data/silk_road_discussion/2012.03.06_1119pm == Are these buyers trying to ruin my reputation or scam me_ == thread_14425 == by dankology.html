				Now i&#039;ve got two buyers giving me a 1 out of 5 for reasons that were completely beyond my control, here is the feedback:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Came with an extra hit!! took all three at the same time and it was pretty shitty. after the long wait, crappy product, and overall experience I wont use this vendor again :(</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">pretty sure i got nigged hard, this guy is a selective scammer. he made me finalize early and this is the 1st US order that didnt come through. there must be some pretty poor packaging if u can sneak peices of paper in the mail</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />These are my 1 out of 5&#039;s on my feedback that has pretty much killed my percentage (along with the 2 out of 5 that has absolutely no feedback whatsoever) not that I really care about it much at this point, but it really gets on my nerves to see this shit.&nbsp; Lets address the first guy:<br /><br />I sent this guy 3 hits instead of 2 just because I had a couple left overs.&nbsp; I know that my LSD is not the strongest on here but it IS DEFINITELY strong enough to have a body high from one unless OTHER VARIABLES HAVE COME INTO PLAY that I have nothing to do with.&nbsp; You can see from my feedback both here and on my seller page one hit definitely had noticeable effects.&nbsp; So what exactly is this guy doing?&nbsp; Just throwing a fit because he &quot;didnt feel anything&quot; although he received the exact product many others did?&nbsp; I have contacted him asking what I need to do to get him to change it.&nbsp; If nothing happens am I shit outta luck?<br /><br />The second guy is plain and simple.&nbsp; &quot;Didn&#039;t receive&quot; his package after he finalized early, and yes I sure made him do it too because of his high refund percentage.&nbsp; So i&#039;m guessing he just took a shot at my rep since he couldnt get his free drugs.&nbsp; I have also contacted him asking what I can do to get him to change it, but really im somewhat suspicious about both of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp;

				I&#039;d think the first guy would at least have been more forgiving even with &quot;weak&quot; tabs as you threw in an extra one. As for the second guy since I&#039;m new I don&#039;t know how to feel when it comes to shipping problems. Out of your control, unless it wasn&#039;t sent. Not saying you scammed or anything, just saying it&#039;s not always clear.

				Yeah, definitely.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone through my feedback a couple times to check all the numbers.&nbsp; Excluding the 2 out of 5 I was given by some guy who just left &quot;Leave Feedback Here&quot; in the god damn space, lol.<br /><br />I shipped it, in fact I shipped it with a bunch of others, that whole round got to people fine.&nbsp; Thing is I can&#039;t really/don&#039;t use DCN when sending Lucy because of how I send the packages.&nbsp; But I think I may just go through the hassle of adding DCN just for proof, its definitely worth the 75 cents.
