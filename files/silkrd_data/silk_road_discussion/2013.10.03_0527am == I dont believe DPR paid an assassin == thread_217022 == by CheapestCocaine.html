				Although I am not opposed to the idea, nor would I do differently than he allegedly did, I think the government specifically put that part in the story to get the public to go along with their agenda more. I think the American public has gotten to the point where it does not take the war on drugs as seriously as we used to (which is good), but being anti-murder never goes out of style. We know the government hates bitcoin, and we know they hate Silk Road, so why not portray Silk Road as violent, and bitcoins as murder funding? At the very least, it was exaggerated. All the stories online say Silk Road sells weapons, which it hasnt for a long time, and we all know that, but the public doesn&#039;t! And it&#039;s not like we&#039;re about to openly support SR -- its illegal! But in conclusion, I think it has been a pattern for the government to lie or exaggerate to the people to get them to go along with their agendas, and I do think that is happening here.<br /><br />by the way, a thread most of us have been posting on today was quoted and written about in forbes: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216947.0

				When I first saw that, I immediately thought to the little introductory blurb from SR.<br /><br />Among the couple/few explicitly stated items outlawed, assassinations and child pornography always stuck out in my memory.<br /><br />Fuck the police. Fuck the police.

				I defintely think he would hire a hitman, especially consideing the circumstance. You had a malevolent figure trying to hack and crash the servers, supposedly, and repeatedly trying to release tons of users personal details and trying to blackmail DPR. <br /><br />Now think of this. If the server image from July realy did get seized, the Govt could have all of that data. They could have been trying to blackmail DPR as a foreign party, and then when he went to go get a hitman, they had an agent set up as one and offer his services. It&#039;s kinda clever really. Did it really happen like this? Who knows. Though, something in me doubts DPR would just send 40,000/40,000 to some random &#039;hitman&#039;. From what I heard agents staged the whole thing, took pictures showing the &#039;suspect&#039; being &#039;tortured&#039;, and had the hitman suggest he more drastic measures would need to be taken, hence when DPR opted for it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know though, it kinda sounds like something out of a story book. Or something like an episode of Burn Notice...

				Veetano ---<br /><br />OK, so if the guy really did know DPR&#039;s personal information, the story is that the hitman was an agent correct? So why wouldn&#039;t the agent, instead of just faking a murder like he supposedly did, go to the address DPR gave him and get all the information he could? OR is that what happened...

				I don&#039;t believe it for a second. They made that shit up so liberals who don&#039;t do drugs don&#039;t take his side and say they&#039;re imprisoning a guy who never hurt anyone FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. Meanwhile, no banker in the US has ever been jailed in the face of 100&#039;s of billions of dollars gambled away in probably illegal derivatives contracts.<br /><br />CUNTS.
