				As so many waited anxiously while our beloved road fell ill, many of us kept our cool, continued to have mad faith that everything would work out just fine and that DPR was working hard to get everything rolling again and for who again?<br /><br />US!&nbsp; Yes folks, us. Don&#039;t ever forget about that and for everyone who had nothing but bad things to say or continued to bitch and complain about waiting, the site being down, etc etc etc....which just like the &quot;I approve this message&quot; commercials we are all sick of before election years are even over...haha&nbsp; &nbsp;but seriously, DPR, GREAT freaking job dude. For those of us who have nothing but eternal gratefulness for all that you do and continue to do, thank you is simply not enough to express how truly grateful may of us feel. (If you are even reading this lol)<br /><br />So to add, and this goes for all the wonderful and absolutely incredible vendors out there, kudos is due for you guys as well and I dont just mean recently, I am speaking from the start to present moment. Without you guys as well, there would be a road to nowhere... right? Who&#039;s with me? <br /><br />I end this message with a question to you all....&nbsp; Many of us had been blessed by amazing vendors who during the &quot;crisis&quot; were going above and beyond to help as much as they could in any way possible. With that being said, I&#039;m personally interested in looking more into sites and programs like Propster dot com which for those who do no know about it and bitcookies, it&#039;s in my mind a really badass way to say thank you to someone. It&#039;s a virtual tip jar basically and I&#039;d be happy to share any info with those who are interested. How many of you who are buyers, sellers, admins, mods, etc are interested in this type of thing? Because I&#039;d like to pay it forward to those who much deserve it once and awhile:)<br /><br />Much love and peace to you all guys!
