				Hello all. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am very excited to have figured out Tor and Silk Road basics, but my inexperience in all things security related has left me baffled. I have read virtually all the FAQs and How-to&#039;s from BitCoins to PGP and everything in between, but still I find myself so confused. I am losing patience spending hours a day trying to figure all this out. Let&#039;s just say that the extent of my computer skills would be setting up a wireless router that I just bought at WalMart, and all i know how to use is basic windows applications. This being said, I am afraid to dive in an attempt a purchace...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think I&#039;ll spend a few more days researching and learning before going any further. In writing this, I&#039;m even questioning if posting it will be a red flag for potential attackers and scammers wanting to take advantage of my inexperience. What do you guys think? Also, when registering on the forum I wondered if using a gmail account is safe (this question alone probably reveals exactly how ignorant i am!)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can anyone give me some pointers?<br /><br />Thank you so much!

				Using your real Gmail account is fail. There is no need for Gmail account and now you can be revealed by anyone who manages to hack forum. You already revealed yourself to SR forum administration.<br /><br />If You manage to make first purchase, you are good. Send your address to seller in PGP encrypted message.

				Hello SR peeps....another nooob here!!&nbsp; &nbsp;as i continue to beef up my tech for security and learn the ropes, I am still pinching myself in disbelief that I may soon be able to purchase some of my favorite substances here.<br /><br />Any suggestions for particularly safe and reliable vendors in the Opioid category? i am a stable, professional buyer who seeks a long term relation ship with a reputable seller. Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you!!<br /><br />RH

				LadyCake, do as the other&#039;s said. Ditch your LadyCake account if you used your real email, re-sign up with a different account name, and use a fake email. Also ditch your SilkRoad account if it&#039;s name is also LadyCake. Make sure your account names can not link you to anything in real life. Do not make your Silkroad/Forum account name the same as any other account you have in real life, like a Reddit.com or Steam account.<br /><br />The biggest hurdle to buying drugs is getting bitcoins. Here&#039;s the easiest, most straightforward way. Make an mtgox.com account. Mtgox is the biggest trader of bitcoins. After your account there is made, go to bitinstant.com, which is an official partner of mtgox. Use the payment method &quot;Cash Bank Deposit.&quot; There will be a 5% fee, but it&#039;s worth it. You&#039;ll go through the steps, and it&#039;ll have you pick a bank near you and print out a bank deposit slip. Take that deposit slip to that bank, with the money, and after that transaction is over the money will instantly go into your mtgox account. <br /><br />After the money is in your mtgox account, then you&#039;ll go to the &quot;trade&quot; section of mtgox, and convert your USD into bitcoins. Then after you have bitcoins into your mtgox account, go to &quot;funding options&quot; on the mtgox page, and select withdraw bitcoins. Then send your bitcoins to www.instawallet.orgâ€‹. The coins will show up immediately on instawallet, but you&#039;ll have to wait about 30 mins before you can send them. Then you&#039;ll go to the Silkroad page, click on the &quot;account&quot; button on the top right, and get the address that you need to receive bitcoins. You&#039;ll then send the coins from instawallet to your Silkroad address.<br /><br />There it is. It seems complicated, but I swear it&#039;s easy as hell. For your first few items, just buy cheap things, like a $50 items. This is just so that you get the hang of everything and build feedback and reputation for yourself. Just take and learn everything one step at a time. Here&#039;s the steps to buying something off of Silkroad,<br /><br />1. Get bitcoins to your Silkroad account. <br /><br />2. Find an item you&#039;ll want to buy. Make sure it&#039;s from a good, reliable vendor. If the vendor is ranked within the top 20, expect that package to take a long time since they get a huge influx of orders. In my experience, it&#039;s best to buy from someone with above 100 successful transactions, but not someone who gets 25 orders a day.<br /><br />3. After finding the item you want, read the vendor&#039;s profile page. Does he require you to use PGP encryption to send your address to him? If so, the next step will be learning how to encrypt a message with PGP. That can be tricky, but feel free to post a thread here if you&#039;re having any trouble learning how to do that. Also, make sure to use your REAL NAME and a real address. A P.O Box is fine. If the seller sends you a tracking number, DO NOT check that tracking number on TOR. Most sellers don&#039;t send tracking numbers.<br /><br />4. Since you&#039;re rather new, the seller may send you a message asking you to &quot;finalize early.&quot; The &quot;finalize&quot; button will but found under the &quot;orders&quot; tab on Silkroad&#039;s main page. It&#039;s normal for a seller to ask a brand new buyer to finalize early, but you are at a slight risk. That&#039;s why you don&#039;t want to jump in balls deep with $500 dollar orders. Keep it small at first while you get a hang of things and build a rep.<br /><br />5. Here&#039;s the hardest part of the whole thing.. waiting for your package to arrive. It will consume your mind, your soul, your very essence. You&#039;ll be anxious and excited 24/7 until you get the package. When it arrives, it&#039;s the hugest rush ever, it&#039;s probably a better high than the drug you&#039;re even getting. I think I&#039;m addicted to just receiving orders at this point.<br /><br />You can use your real name and email addresses for things like Mtgox and Bitinstant. Do not go to mtgox.com or bitinstant.com using tor, use them on your regular internet browser. Any questions?
