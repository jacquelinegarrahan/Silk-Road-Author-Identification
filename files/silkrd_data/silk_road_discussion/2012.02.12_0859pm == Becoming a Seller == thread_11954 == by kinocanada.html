				I am heavily interested in vending quality TMA-6, 2C-C, 2C-E, 2C-I, and other psychedelic products. Though I cannot do so without bitcoins currently in my account? I was heavily interested in acquiring heroin from a Canadian source but the only way to currently acquire BTC is through sales.<br /><br />What is the cost of becoming a seller?

				If you get started with a quality product and good service you will make that 150 back really quick once you are proven reliable.<br /><br />You should look into places like canadianbitcoins.com or fine a way to fund Mt. gox or tradehill if you can (sorry I am really unfamiliar with buying coins in CAN) to obtain coins. Also, you should search the forum for ways to get coins in CAN. If you need assistance after that you could even PM the vendor since hes from CAN too and ask if he can suggest a way to get coins there. <br /><br />Good luck,<br />- miR

				If you go to mt gox and create an acct, then click on add funds or funding options or whatever it is, you scroll down to bitinstant. Click bitinstant and it will take you to bitinstant&#039;s site and they will give you instructions on making a cash bank deposit (no ID needed). I&#039;m sure this can be done in CA as well. I deposited at 10 am and had coins in my SR acct by around 3 pm. Bitinstant charges about 5 per 100 you add to mt gox. There are other cheaper ways to fund like dwolla, but they take time. I would steer clear of bitcoin for moneypak options. While many are legit, and they fund within a few hours, it is the most common scam on SR and the forums. Good luck.

				Neither the cash deposits nor dwolla nor moneypak are supported in CAN. AD you should take a minute to check if you should recommend something for someone in a different country if you want to tell people not to post incorrect information&nbsp; :P&nbsp; i too really am grateful for the bitinstant cash route though, same day coins for 5% rock, compared to people going the MP route paying anywhere from two to what, ten times the percentage fee...<br /><br />Unfortunately for you KD, until just recently you could have used paxum but that is no longer available for some reason. However, I would recommend you look into funding tradehill or mt. gox and you may be able to do this using bitinstant and liberty reserve actually. Must do some research probably though.<br /><br />Good luck,<br />- miR

				Thx micro- I will start researching the available funding methods for mt gox IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. I promise I will never make the same stupid mistake again. I can&#039;t believe I almost told somebody they could do something they actually couldn&#039;t!
