				I recently bought an item from a seller with good prior feedback but the item was useless. I ended up taking more than I should have just to see if I could get anything from it but nothing happened, not even the usual side effects. I am very familiar with the effects of the drug as I have taken it many times before and I am well aware of how I should have felt if it had any amount of the drug in the product. What is the best course of action? I haven&#039;t finalised the sale and I am going to keep the details private for now.

				Message the vendor, explain this to them.&nbsp; It could be an honest mistake.&nbsp; If they aren&#039;t offering to fix it, when you finalize, you can give poor feedback explaining your situation.

				Well Hoover the last trusted vendor I attempted to make a purchase from on here ripped me off to the tune of several hundred dollars and I got nothing in return at least you are in good standing far as i can see...Hope everything works out well for you...

				I am the vendor in question. <br />I can&#039;t explain why the speed didn&#039;t work for this customer.<br />As I told him, I have sold over ten grams of this gear (all the same batch), and even have two repeat customers for it. <br />Nobody else has complained and the feedback has all been good. There is even a very positive trip report in the forums here somewhere of a guy who went camping and had it. <br />I have offered him a full refund (before reading this thread), and suggest he try another vendor. <br />I have suggested he buy a gram of European paste from overseas and try that. I am curious to know if it still does nothing for him. Some people are only used to meth, and don&#039;t realise the cheap speed paste is nothing like that. <br />Anyway, I have done all I can to make it right for him by offering a full refund, as I am a new vendor and am trying to build a good rep. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Kiki<br />

				Hey Kiki, I didn&#039;t want to name you publicly because I know you are a respected vendor. For the record I was very happy with the service but for whatever reason this product had basically no effect on me or my friend at a high dose. I am used to pharmaceutical Dexedrine so I know the effects of amphetamine (I have never tried meth).<br /><br />Anyway, as you can see we have reached an arrangement so I hope people see Kiki is an honest vendor.

				i&#039;ve been a stoner nearly all my life so admittedly i know next to nothing about speed but as far as personal experience goes most of my mates that were into it would normally take half a gram *standard* dose...1/6 of a gram doesn&#039;t sound like a lot and may have been where you went wrong..<br /><br />just my 2 pence..

				Thought I would do some quality control to make sure the gear was still OK.<br />Had half a gram with my morning coffee, and I am buzzing along quite nicely.<br />About to vacuum the house :)<br />I can have a gram of this stuff in day very easily, but as I say in the listing, it&#039;s not super strong like meth, but still very nice for the price. <br />I would get the same mileage out of a gram of this, then I would for a point of meth (which is about the same price in Australia). <br />

				@Hoover - you say you have never had meth before, yet I just noticed another forum thread titled &quot;micron filter for crystal meth iv&quot; where you are asking advice on what to use. <br />Care to explain?<br />Two SR buyer accounts, two SR forum accounts? <br />I call shenanigans.

I have used Dexedrine in the past so I know what speed should feel like.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s been resolved by the vendor so there is not much use in continuing this thread.
