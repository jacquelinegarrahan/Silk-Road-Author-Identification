				Just wondering if other people think it would be a good idea to stop saying what country you are from when buying and leaving feedback. I know it maybe good for vendors to have people know if they are successful at getting packages through to certain destinations however this could actually be working against us and telegraphing what goes where.<br /><br />I have seen one vendor saying on his page to not do this so maybe its a good idea if we all stop. I have found vendors are usually more than happy to let you know their successes. Could this be giving those who can use this information a bit more to go on? <br /><br />Just an idea, anyone else got thoughts on this?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Perhaps it would be a tad safer, however most people do not post anything about their local at all, and those who do usually do it as follows.<br /><br />&quot;order arrived to Northwest (Insert country here) right on time 5/5 etc...&quot;<br /><br />revealing very little about location.<br /><br />It wont be a prevalent issue until vendors explicitly ask SR or their customers to refrain from this.<br /><br />Also i am not sure if &#039;telegraphing&#039; is the correct word.<br /><br />

				Feedback should always just be short and sweet.<br /><br />Have no idea why some people feel the need to write an essay about their transaction.

				Not wanting to appear petty but &#039;Telegraphing&#039; in this context is a word that means &#039;to unintentionally alert an opponent to one&#039;s situation &#039; being &#039;packages are getting through&#039;. As opposed to &#039;feinting&#039; which is&#039; to disguise ones intentions&#039;. It is commonly used in unarmed combat and other sports.<br /><br />I also appreciate that people don&#039;t give specifics as I have read many many reviews but in the case of naming a country it then gives customs a heads up that packages are getting through and they need to pick up their game . If no countries where mentioned it would be giving nothing away. In regards to my country I would much rather keep them guessing&nbsp; than confirming their suspicions. I know they have many ways to gather intelligence but every piece missing is a picture less clear.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />

				People SHOULD be writing essays about their products, well at least a paragraph.<br /><br /><br />I absolutely hate reading short concise feedbacks. I mean sure it&#039;s great for finding out if the product weighed out properly and if it got their on time... but for quality it tells nothing.<br /><br />I can&#039;t even tell you the amount of times I have trusted feedbacks that said &quot;Good quality&quot;, ordered the product and it was crap. I simply don&#039;t trust the judgement of some people. People who are new to certain drugs might say what they received was good, but if they&#039;re not specific how do I know what their experience really was like? They could be completely oblivious to what the experience should have been, and it can result it other people getting ripped off.<br /><br />If people aren&#039;t descriptive you have no idea how much attention they gave the product. This definitely applies to things like Fake IDs.... ordering some with feedback saying they&#039;re great, only to find there are a ton of amateaur mistakes in the ID that the feedback person didn&#039;t catch due to lack of attention to detail.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how any LE could use the vague area of the country against anyone..... but at the very least people, be more descriptive in your feedback. /Rant.

				Could say the same about people who do the opposite.<br /><br />leaving feedback blank or the countless &#039;leave feedback here&#039; doesn&#039;t really give me a good idea of what the vendor is like

				I&#039;m one of those buyers who state their country and the time the package took to arrive.<br /><br />I only do so for future buyers in my region, so that they know how long they&#039;ll have to wait for their order. We all know that the estimations on the vendors&#039; pages aren&#039;t always accurate.

				Since one time a buyer mentioned the country in the feedback (AU the hardest one to ship to I think) I have a lot more buyers.<br />All shipments successful. <br />Maybe luck but still....<br />

Use your fucking heads people. Stating the country of success to LE provides them with vendors to purchase off and profile there packaging, This has happened to several larger vendors time and time again especially with orders to Australia when comments are left &quot;7 DAYS TO AUSTRALIA&quot;<br /><br />There is no reason to post this shit at all, AT ALL. In the end you&#039;re just ruining it for yourself.
