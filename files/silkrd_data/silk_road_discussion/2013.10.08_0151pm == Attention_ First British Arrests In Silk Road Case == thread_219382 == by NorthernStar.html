				First British Silk Road suspects arrested by new National Crime Agency<br />Four men suspected of being significant users of Silk Road, the billion dollar online narcotics bazaar, have been arrested in the UK, The Daily Telegraph can disclose.<br /><br />The arrests were the first in the UK following the collapse of the world&#039;s biggest internet drug dealing hub and the detention of its alleged founder Ross Ulbricht, 29, in San Francisco by the FBI last week.<br />One man in his early 50s was held in Devon and three others in their early 20s were arrested in Manchester on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs.<br />They are being investigated by the newly formed National Crime Agency, which launched on Monday with 4,000 officers and has vowed to instill &quot;fear&quot; into organised criminals.<br />More British suspects linked to Silk Road, which had hundreds of thousands of users, are expected to be detained in coming weeks.<br />Keith Bristow, the NCA’s Director General, said: “These arrests send a clear message to criminals, the hidden internet isn&#039;t hidden and your anonymous activity isn&#039;t anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you.<br />&quot;It is impossible for criminals to completely erase their digital footprint. No matter how technology-savvy the offender, they will always make mistakes and this brings law enforcement closer to them.&quot;<br />Ulbricht appeared in court in San Francisco on Friday and is accused of operating under the internet moniker &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; to run Silk Road.<br />The FBI claims the website facilitated $1.2 billion in sales in less than two years, with Ulbricht taking $80 million in commissions.<br />It was used by drug dealers around the globe to advertise their products for sale including heroin, LSD, cocaine and cannabis. It was also used by computer hackers and hit men to offer their services in many countries<br />Referred to as an &quot;anonymous Amazon,&quot; it was part of what investigators call the hidden &quot;dark web,&quot; where users are more difficult to track.<br />Using technology first developed by the US Navy communications are bounced off servers around the world.<br />People using the site to buy drugs also used the virtual currency Bitcoin to lessen the chances of being detected.<br />After sales were agreed drugs were sent through the regular post between vendors and buyers with consignments vacuum packed to avoid discovery.<br />According to a 33-page FBI affidavit filed in San Francisco there were 957,079 user accounts on Silk Road.<br />About 30 per cent of those were in the United States and the country with the next highest number of users was the UK. The agency did not say how many users there were in the UK.<br />The UK arrests were carried out by National Crime Agency officers who were working closely with American law enforcement agencies, and took place hours after Ulbricht was held in San Francisco.<br />Andy Archibald, head of the NCA&#039;s National Cyber Crime Unit, said: “This is only the start of a wider campaign to tackle the ‘dark’ or ‘deep’ web and the criminals exploiting it.<br />“These criminal areas of the internet aren’t just selling drugs. It’s where fraud takes place, where the trafficking of people and goods is discussed, where child abuse images are exchanged and firearms are traded.&quot;<br /><br />Devon and Manchester Ooh arr how bizzare<br />

				It makes ya think after reading that!!<br /><br />Do ye think it was just their lack of security or not using pgp which got them caught or is there something bigger we&#039;re missing here which may actually allow them to trace all users that they want???<br /><br /><br />Peace out,<br />Evoc.

				And so it begins....<br /><br />They have two main sources of information at present<br /><br />1) They have the server images from SR - the feds gave this to SOCA, er, NCA. This gives them the following:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a) All unencrypted PM&#039;s - I need say no more<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;b) Transaction logs - if they have managed to pick apart the database schema, and i would imagine that they have, then it is likely they have a full list of transactions conducted on SR since the start. Doesn&#039;t mean they can tie SR usernames to real world identities depending on how careful you have been.<br />&nbsp; c) Bitcoin transactions - a bit more blurry here depending on how good/bad the tumbler was<br /><br />2) Vendor records: We have yet to see the effect of this and it is down to how careful vendors are with address details. Hopefully most vendors are not retaining customer details or orders.<br /><br />If all of your sensitive PMs are encrypted then assume they have got nothing other than transaction logs which they will be unable to attribute to a real-world identity. <br /><br />If you sent a single PM with your address, phone number, name etc in then, unfortunately, that immediately compromises that SR user and any transactions/history associated with it. Not enough to tie it to use conclusively but enough for them to start digging further into phone records, bank records etc. The fact is though anything from SR is unlikely to constitute very strong evidence on it&#039;s own.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE CONCERNED THEN:<br /><br />1) Clean house - obviously. The only real evidence is real evidence - not some tenuous electronic trail<br />2) backup necessary details from your computers onto a truecrypt USB stick and then nuke the hard disk ( see http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216533.0 ) - ensure that the USB stick is not in your possession - remember *you can be compelled to hand over the pasphrase by law* <br /><br />IF ANYONE NEEDS DEFENSE TECHNICAL EXPERT WITNESS (Europe only) THEN LET ME KNOW VIA This_is_not_soca@safe-mail.net - I KNOW PEOPLE WHO CAN PROBABLY HELP WHETHER THAT IS TALKING WITH YOUR SOLICITOR OR ATTENDING COURT. NO PROMISES OTHER THAN I PROMISE THAT WE WILL TRY. WE CAN OFTEN UNDERMINE TECHNICAL EVIDENCE AND AT THE VERY LEAST WE WILL MAKE THE PROSECUTION WORK THEIR ASSES OFF WHERE YOUR CASE RESTS LARGELY ON TECHNICAL EVIDENCE.<br /><br />Stay Safe

				I saw this article and thought it could have been Ivory... To produce LSD you have to know someone with some wicked skill set and a bit more! This is limited to say the least and would make things quicker/easier to trace. The was i read it was 4 people together, Not separate but if it is separate i doubt it was Ivory.<br /><br />Just think, Your taking your place in history and you play your part in changing the minds of the general public and show the world is not as evil as they want you to believe. Drop the fear of incarceration and then you will truly see/feel what it like to be truly free!<br /><br />It&#039;s obvious the general public is falling on side of us rather than the scripted lines of any government or LE. People are awake to there crimes now so when something like this happens, Someone fills there shoes rather rapidly and the world moves forward, Been woken even more to the realities we all face. <br /><br />Be strong and stand up to your place in time, No matter how big or small, You are still an integral part of the human consciousness, Our own mycilian world. Drop the fear of death and punishment that they prey upon you with and do whatever you can to wake people around you.<br /><br />THe next generation will be fearless, They have nothing to lose.....<br /><br />Peace

				It says they were supplying the drugs, so most likely a vendor(s). I only think that because all in there early 20&#039;s and in Manchester? I think they all might be part of the same Vendor? If so, it must be a large one if there are 4 people concerned in packaging, runs etc.<br /><br />Need some more information really. I think all vendors who bought off other Vendors on SR though are at risk....

				Hoping &quot;PlutoPete&quot; drops by to give some helpful info on all this.<br /><br />If some of his outwards packages (none of which were illegal) were destined for Manchester area then this will reduce a lot of fear among anyone following this thread and may explain the Manchester thing.<br /><br />But on the other hand, if none were to be sent there then I feel there is reason to stay very cautious of proceedings for all.<br /><br />Again, it could be down to something as simple as lack of encryption on messages which they are working off and I actually believe this is the only clues these NCA donks are going on.<br /><br />Peace out,<br />Evoc

				I know mate, intrigued about the manny (Manchester) connection. There is a few top UK&nbsp; vendors who&nbsp; have disappeared. Has any one seen Topnotch? Jimmy Boyle, they both knock out class A&#039;s and could be top of list. Oh no, that sky news story is saying 8 arrests now, Essex, Merseyside, Devon, and a few more, not looking good.

				Thanks for checking in Pete....<br /><br />Fuckers anyways.... Surely it must be lack of encryption at some stage in there vending life which exposed them?<br /><br />The possibilities of them being able to identify people in other ways is scary and i&#039;m sure it&#039;ll never be disclosed to the public if they know something we don&#039;t :(<br /><br />I&#039;m just hoping lack of PGP is all they&#039;re going by.<br /><br />Hope whoever they&#039;ve caught don&#039;t get screwed over either :(<br /><br />Peace out,<br />Evoc

				Jimmy Boyle has migrated to Sheep for sure, not sure about BMR. Now Topnotch is an interesting one. I had purchased from him a few times in the past and judging by his feedback he was knocking out a fair amount of gear. Really hope it&#039;s not him.

				PP - if really you, best of luck with your case. Sad to see you were caught up in this.<br /><br />This was reported right after it happened many days ago and we knew you part of it. Don know why this late report released maybe with more details.<br /><br />Products you were sell should tell us all more info. How did they get you, were current packages caught, was any address info compromised, etc.?<br /><br />PM us.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t panic guys, if your smart encrypting evrything leaving no prints or traces on the packages your sending etc.. you should be fine.. Theyre only going for the HUUUGE vendors and since they can get to them they MUST have made mistakes of some sort, trashtalking leaving too much personal info didnt encrypt enough ..<br />I pray for TechnoHippy to come online soon and leave a mark that he&#039;s safe tho! Symbs aswell.. Marcel and sub is fine uk ket vends.. and remember;<br /><br />FUCK THE POLICE<br />ACAB!!

				One rule I tried to tell many, treat every package suspect, let&#039;s leave it to trade secrets.<br /><br /><br />However, without exposing anyone further, I had a rough idea where techno was located, I have spoken to technohippy before, he&#039;s really nice a chap, let&#039;s hope the best for him.<br /><br /><br />In addition, DrCol has seemed to have checked in since 2nd october. <br /><br /><br />UK had many big time vendors, it would be good if they can check in, just to let all know everything is fine.<br /><br /><br />They shouldn&#039;t have any reason to kick my door in, but if they do, in the next few weeks, I will be sure to give a heads up. <br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				Just like to point out that there were also co-ordinated raids this morning in Manchester, its probally un-related but it got pushed down the que in the News section, instead the SR busts taking the limelight.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Police investigating drug dealing raided seven homes across Greater Manchester this morning.<br /><br />They smashed down doors in Cheetham Hill, Oldham and south Manchester just before dawn.<br /><br />The five men, aged between 27 and 29, were arrested.<br /><br />They were being quizzed today on suspicion of possession of class B drugs with intent to supply, possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Non-SR related it seems, anyway it says the people who were arrested in Manchester was co-ordinated with the take down of SR, and at the same time as plutopete though its only being reported now. Whoever they were they didn&#039;t want them being scared off by the shutdown.

				As a small buyer i would not worry that much. <br /><br />Perhaps you&#039;ve ordered 50 grams of pot in several shipments, which seems to be no big deal, and since the evidence of that has probably literally gone up in smoke by now, it would be a case that takes law enforcement a lot of effort without getting a conviction beyond possession for personal use (if even that). <br /><br />For arresting small time buyers and users this is simply too much work: police can round those up in any number they want on the streets, caught red handed exchanging cash for drugs. The burden of proof in an online transaction is much more difficult, even if you had been placing your orders without using PGP and the server falling into the hands of a foreign government. <br /><br />Most buyers use a fake name to receive goods on, despite some using their home address. It would be very very difficult to get a conviction out of some conversation that cannot be tied to your IP address (since you were using TOR), nor leaving a solid money trail (as you were using BTC). <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it is impossible to proof it, just that it is overly difficult compared to just rounding up some kid of the street that just bought an ounce of pot from a dealer on any random street. For law enforcement results count, and putting a terrible amount of resources into something that isn&#039;t likely to yield result (i.e. conviction) is just a waste of time.

Anything from Silk Road is not hard evidence, yes it is evidence but by itself it is not enough.<br /><br />The guys getting busted now have probably been under surveillance for at least 2 months, and that is assuming they were not already before NCA&nbsp; got their hands on the information from the SR server. <br /><br />Fact is if they deemed you high value enough they would have then been looking at call records, bank records, internet records (except tor of course) your associations and potentially even close surveillance and this is what they use as evidence, in court. The SR information may have acted as the seed for some of the targeted surveillance and investigation which then led to the busts but it can only be used, at best, to support more real-world evidence. <br /><br />Without that real-world evidence the information from SR is really fairly worthless from a legal perspective - please remember that if you find yourself in a spot or have great angst.<br />

				I&#039;ve been thinking about it all day and I think I&#039;ve got a theory to how they knew who these guys were....now this is just a theory and I have no evidence but it is the best I can come up with.&nbsp; Either the feds were tracking them like they did NOD (very unlikely since they are in britain), or they somehow linked them to bitcoins that drugs were purchased with.&nbsp; Anyone with millions of pounds of bitcoins is gonna need to cash them out somehow....I&#039;m guessing the feds made a vendor account and were sending cash in the mail for their bitcoins (again just speculation)...but this would explain how the feds knew these individuals and their addresses.....the british police said there will be more arrests, so maybe the feds have more names, but I doubt it...otherwise what are they waiting for?

Fuckin disgusting!!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suspect they won&#039;t bother, even if they had the address. There are a couple of glaring holes in our knowledge; first, we know they had in image of the site dated end of July (24th?), but there is no indication either way they had access to the site between then and DPR&#039;s bust on 3rd Oct. They were certainly very interested in getting Ross with his laptop on and signed in, which indicates they wanted access keys, but then how could they have read server image without them? I&#039;m guessing the access to the server was encrypted, but data was either partially or fully unencrypted. However, it is a strong possibility that they couldn&#039;t access anything between the imaging and the bust, including orders and addresses. Also, we have to hope that it wasn&#039;t BS that addresses were deleted after orders were marked &#039;in transit&#039;. Both those things being true, then the only window of vulnerability is anyone with orders &#039;pending&#039; at the time the image was taken. Fingers crossed. Any PMs might be an issue though - they seem to have alot of those going way back, so I hope no one &#039;hypothetically&#039; put anything sensitive there...<br /><br />The other point, that others have made, is that they are unlikely to go after small-time buyers as they REALLY need to find drugs at someone&#039;s house to get a conviction. Data from SR or the forum and the like is all very good supporting evidence, but in the UK the law pertains to &#039;possession&#039; of drugs - that&#039;s why you can&#039;t be arrested for being high unless you&#039;re causing some kind of disturbance. I dunno about you, but my house is CLEAN now just in case. So what if they had an address vaguely connected to me or some next tenuous digital connection, I don&#039;t have any drugs. I can&#039;t see the CPS gunning for a conviction there, so the fuzz probably won&#039;t waste their time on it beyond trying to trick you into confessing... x<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Posted by: MarcelKetman<br />« on: Today at 09:31 am »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Insert Quote<br /><br /><br />Wish British journalists would pull their finger out regarding the Manchester case and get the details.<br /><br />2 down in Sweden now as well apparently: http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/uk-police-arrest-seize-currency-silk-road-20505213</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, but TBH it&#039;s all pretty below the radar.

				When I read about this new national crime agency I thought it sounds more like a US agency operating in the UK. Im not saying the 4000 are american they wouldnt be but I thought they would be operating under some US guidance and surprised surprise at the bottom of the article it says they are working closely with the US authorities. So they are working together. Which really means working for the US. When ever we work &#039;with&#039; the US it means &#039;for&#039; the US.<br /><br />On the bright side they are saying &#039;the hidden web isnt hidden, and the anonymous profiles and activities are not anonymous&#039;. They can track where every one is and what every one is doing. If that was the case they wouldnt tell everyone they would just arrest them all. Them announcing that to me implies it is not the case. They are releasing that information to deter people rather than to let every one know they are going to arrest them.<br /><br />Although what worries me is the UK has a law it wont extradite people to another country which uses capital punishment. Yet they always extradite someone if the US government whats them to. They also have a law that no outside agency is allowed to operate while armed on out shores. Yet when Bush went to UK he brought his Secret Service armed of course coz he wont go anywhere with out his armed guard. Im not saying people with guns are coming just its a worrying trend of disregarding British law in the case of the US government wanting it to happen.<br /><br />4000 new people in the NCA and about 300,000 british users thats a ratio of 1 to 100. These are rough figures but a reminder that volume is on our side.

The buyer still has to be caught in the act IRL. You need to be arrested in possession of a controlled substance. Only then will that person be charged with possessing that amount of the controlled substance what ever that may be. Just look at it as the same as buying it on the street. In one case it is put in your hand buy the seller in the other it is put into your hand by the seller via the post service. Theres not much difference other than the defense of saying I did not ask for it, which I dont know if it would stand up in court, would depend on the other evidence.<br /><br />I dont think the police can be blamed for the Hilsborough disaster. It is not easy controlling 100,000 people crammed into a few streets. The police are now actually very very good at controlling the masses of people at these huge events. The result being an improvement of survelliance and control of the masses. Your demands shared by many many people have given the authorities the justification needed to take away personal freedoms. It spread from &#039;crowd control&#039; to &#039;population control&#039;. Seems funny to me someone using this particular forum while complaining the police dont exercise enough control over people.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading SR forum with great interest. I&#039;m really sad to hear about all the busts in UK, USA and Sweden. <br />This is a notice for everyone who &quot;survived&quot; this shit that PGP is a MUST without any exception. Also vendors should wear gloves while packing for everyones saftey. Every suspicious vendor/package/deal should be warned on forum so other people can take extra precautions.<br />Sorry new vendors on BMR and sheep but I&#039;m gonna stick to old and checked vendors. <br /><br />Anyone have any information on Love maybe? He&#039;s from UK and I don&#039;t thik that he was such a big vendor but he just dissapeared. Hoping that he&#039;s just laying low for now.<br /><br />Stay safe everyone
