				A site called thefarmersmarket that was nowhere near as big as SR on TOR was shutdown by the DEA. Vendors were extradited from south america as well as the netherlands among others. They got 20 yrs, no joke check it out for yourself. So when u think SilkRoads untouchable think again, we need a new site designed for a few hundrend members and that&#039;s not open to anyone register. PIP was but still got shutdown, hard drives taken and time handed out. Recently operation dot com shutdown people advertising drugs online, 2 other sites were also shutdown. I hope this isn&#039;t the case cuz all that money in btcs now is wasted. This is what happens when sites become too popular, even NY senator keeps calling for SR to be shutdown. So besides being awkward that there&#039;s no reason for SR to be offline Im thinking its done, nothing says its off for repairs.

				People on The Farmers Market bought their drugs with paypal and didn&#039;t encrypt anything. The Farmers Market was actually a clearnet website at one point. <br /><br />Calm your nipples, the sites been down for a couple of hours, it&#039;s happened before and it will happen again. The real problem going forward is going to be acquiring bitcoins now that Bitinstant is essentially dead.

				Really, does this topic have to be addressed every time sr goes down? Stop making threads OP this is pointless and TOR has nothing to do with the reason they were busted.

				If SR was really shutdown by DEA then you would most definitely hear about it on the news as well as DPRs identity being revealed, even if they know who DPR is which they might I don&#039;t doubt they can&#039;t tie anything to him..with proper btc cleaning, obviously other investments to cover and not being directly involved with transactions DPRs name is a figure head.

				This is the second time you&#039;ve created one of these threads,what is your problem?<br /><br />If you understand the technologies being used (Tor, pgp, bitcoin) you would know that SR is virtually unstoppable, the only risks are human errors or errors by being careless. Just give them some time and they will solve it. If you don&#039;t like it then seriously gtfo and stop creating these stupid threads you tard.

				Pretty sure bitinstant is working as normal, i was going to use it to get coins the other day and they had the bitcoin address option back up. I didn&#039;t end up using it though because i couldn&#039;t get on SR.

Several arrests in the US as well. <br /><br />As others have pointed out The Farmers Market was not using bitcoins. They were using cash in the mail and Paypal as well as pecunix I belive. This made them an easier target in terms of being able to follow the money.

				The smaller you are the bigger a TARGET you are. It has always been so. A four member group is so much easier to shut down than a four hundred thousand member group.
