				Ok, I am freaking out right now and I am hoping that some more experienced users can either put my mind at ease or point me in the right direction as far as what I should do next. Ok so here is the info about my situation:<br /><br />1) I had a little over 5 bitcoins that I put into my bitcoinfog account. It was in there for a good part of the day. <br /><br />2) Around 3-4pm this afternoon I withdrew a little over 5 bitcoins so that there was a small decimal amount left. <br />-I withdrew it using only 1 bitcoin address that is my bitfloor account address. <br />-I chose the minimum of a 6 hour time lapse that bitcoinfog requires so that they can send randomized amounts to the address you give throughout the time lapse period you chose.<br /><br />3) ONE transaction did come through to my BitFloor account after a couple hours but was only for roughly 1.2 bitcoins, which leaves almost exactly 4 bitcoins to be MIA.&nbsp; <br />-I have been keeping an eye on it all day (my bitfloor account), Nothing has happened since, and I still only have the 1.2 in my bitfloor account. <br /><br />I am really stressed out right now as obviously I have no recourse and my fate is completely in the hands of bitfloor and bitcoinfog. Not to mention bitcoinfog could say that I never had that amount etc, because there are not any logs or history that can be viewed on their site. Bitfloor could say anything really, because I have no way to prove anything. My stomach is in knots right not. <br /><br />If I lost that money I am screwed. I used BitcoinFog about a week ago, maybe less, without any problems, although I cannot recall where I sent it to, I need to look through account history in a few places refresh my memory. <br /><br />What is a likely explanation do you think? I know SR has been very slow but this was just from BitcoinFog to Bitfloor, no SR. I have a good password protecting my bitfloor account, and my PC is secure, or at least very secure compared to most home machines, so my account has not been jacked. Is it unreasonable to think something shady is going on, e.g. incoming deposits are getting siphoned depending on where they came from? With these different bitcoin services closing shop out of the blue I am very worried that transactions could be getting siphoned, but thats just speculation on my part.<br /><br />Any words of wisdom are welcome.

				Is it possible that your coins are just taking longer than expected to male it through the fogger. <br /><br />That&#039;s the thing about bitcoins. Moving them, buying them can test your patients as even the fastest service can occasionally take many hours. <br />&nbsp;<br />Hope they come through for you soon. <br /><br />
