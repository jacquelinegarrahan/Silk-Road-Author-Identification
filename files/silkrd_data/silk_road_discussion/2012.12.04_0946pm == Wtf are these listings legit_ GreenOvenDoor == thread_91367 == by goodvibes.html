Am I missing something here? Are those actual pics of the bud? How can it be this cheap? Someone enlighten me please&nbsp; ???

				It can be that cheap when bought in bulk.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would jump on it except that in the feedback everyone FE&#039;d.&nbsp; That makes me uncomfortable even with someone I&#039;ve dealt with before.&nbsp; One of the feedbacks said FE for free shipping, but on the vendors page it says FE not required.&nbsp; I would just pay for shipping to not FE.&nbsp; It is a good deal though, from where I stand.

				Notice on the listing it says &quot;Priced for three days.&quot;<br />So you better jump on it!!<br /><br />Though.. Priority with Escrow is almost 30 bucks.. We would not FE. Looks like they are setting up for a Tony76.<br />Please use your better judgement.<br /><br />Have a blessed day.

				So you&#039;re saying an OUNCE of this bud for $150 + $30 shipping = $180 is not worth it? It&#039;s gotta be like mids or some shit in that case.. I mean a half oz of pretty good/decent/above average stuff is usually in the ballpark of $150.

				Hello again goodvibes :)<br /><br />I too noticed his sick deals and awesome looking bud. I&#039;ve talked to him in a PM and he seems like a nice dude. AWESOME feedback for only being on the road for a month. I agree with others, I wouldn&#039;t FE just to play it safe.<br /><br />has been a member for 1 month<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 16% of sellers with 99.8% positive feedback from 99 transactions<br />has 203 fans - become a fan<br /><br />Those are really awesome stats for only being around for a month. I plan to give it a shot as well, but if you beat me to it please let me know how it is!

				I&#039;d been super skeptical of TGOD, but after three very successful transactions I can say that their product is top notch, especially for the price.<br /><br />BHO was incredible, as were both the recently offered OG and WiFi Kush&#039;s, both ounces weighed precisely 28 grams - which would be off-putting considering my other regular vendors often weigh considerably over, but when you take into account that each of those cost $200 USD, there&#039;s really no disputing the value.<br /><br />I definitely recommend them.
