				I joined SR to they acid. Always wanted to try it.&nbsp; <br />My thought process was as simple as; &quot;Lsd makes you hallucinate. I want to hallucinate&quot;. <br /><br />Since joining I&#039;ve come to realise that there are many more psychedelics that give hallucinogens. <br />But, I&#039;m lost.<br /><br />Under the &quot;psychedelic&quot; category at the market, I see... <br /><br />&nbsp;2C Family 16<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5-MeO-DALT 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5-MeO-DMT 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5-MEO-MIPT 10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AMT 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DMT 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DOx 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LSD 14<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NBOMe 77 <br /><br />Now, I&#039;m not after someone to just tell me which to take for the best/most vivid visuals, but rather I am after some input from members who have used items specifically on this list.<br /><br />In short, if you&#039;ve used any of the substances about, post about your experience.<br /><br />Erowid is all well and good for facts and general data, but tbh I don&#039;t really buy most of their user submitted experiences. <br /><br />I figure I&#039;d get a more honest response here.<br /><br /><br />In short, I wanna see things. I want to hallucinate. <br /><br />So, reports on visuals and types of high would be greatly appreciated from the knowledge souls here on SR.

				Well DMT you&#039;ll hallucinate / go into another realm for 5-15min.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done it yet but i do have 200mg freebase otw. Can&#039;t wait to try it.<br /><br />I have yet to hallucinate off LSD. First time i did one 250ug tab. great 16h just didnt see shit.&nbsp; Get one of the Christ Vials JOR is offering march 1st.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need at least 4-5 doses for what you are wanting.. bc im in the same boat. I&#039;ve never eaten over an 8th of mushies but i never saw shit. Don&#039;t really like them anymore so just waiting on the LSD and DMT.

				If you just want to see shit, I highly recommend 4 aco dmt, great visuals, and it&#039;s very user friendly.&nbsp; It don&#039;t sound like your very experienced with the hallucinogens.. so you should explore the basics first,&nbsp; LSD and shrooms -make sure you take enough.. at least 300ug of acid, and at least a eight of really good shrooms if you want good open eye visuals.

				Dude: 2C-B + LSD.<br /><br />AMAZING visuals!<br /><br />The most incredible and intense visuals I&#039;ve ever experienced was induced by consuming nearly 1/8 cubensis and 1 Green Olympic Ecstasy pill.&nbsp; I believe it was TFMPP piperazine.<br /><br />Honestly, JoR&#039;s acid is more trippy, whereas 3Jane&#039;s is more spiritual.&nbsp; I&#039;d go with JoR&#039;s for hallucinations.&nbsp; Mix some Ketamine in there and you&#039;ll be golden.&nbsp; For your first experience start with maybe 2 tabs, but for a full blown &#039;psychedelic state&#039; you want 500ug+.&nbsp; Most people don&#039;t know&nbsp; the difference between the state you are in when you take a psychedelic and a &#039;psychedelic state&#039;.&nbsp; The latter is the one you&#039;re shooting for.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d say 5 tabs of JoR&#039;s &#039;cid, 10-15mg 2C-B, and some ketamine to enhance the experience(titrate the ket to desired dose via small bumps).&nbsp; I&#039;d work your way up there though, rather than starting there unless you have a trusted trip sitter.<br /><br />Couple of random thoughts: Nature is AMAZING when on psychedelics. I(and most people i&#039;ve spoken and tripped with) get a ridiculously enhanced appreciation for this beautiful world God created when in such a state.&nbsp; Jannis has some LSD listed right now, he&#039;s a well respected vendor with pretty fast shipping times.&nbsp; AlbionEssentialOLS said he&#039;d have some LSD listed sometime soon, but I haven&#039;t checked his profile or thread lately<br /><br />One more thing I just considered: LSD and shrooms is a pretty epic combo, but it&#039;s more of a headspace thing than a visual thing for me.<br /><br />Best of luck! let us know how it goes. :D<br /><br />Edit:<br />As for Lucius Luv&#039;s comment, 4-AcO-DMT. acts like mushrooms.&nbsp; Although nobody&#039;s QUITE sure how it breaks down it&#039;s largely suspected to break down into psilocyn in your body just like psilocybin does.&nbsp; That being said, I can personally vouch that it&#039;s EXACTLY like shrooms FOR ME.<br /><br />20mg of 4-AcO-DMT freebase ~ 1/8th of shrooms.&nbsp; There are 3 varieties you can find.&nbsp; freebase, hcl, and fumarate from strongest to weakest.

				Hi there , I feel Ur pain .. I joined for the same reason to try hallucinogen.....<br /><br />Everyone was telling LSD is hard core and to start.with shrooms .... So my first purchese was 4-aco-dmt pills from buddah (he left Sr thou sad to say) n the visuals were just amazing like 3d like it was Awsome and unbelievable..... Oh n I had the best laugh in a pong time ....but it also messes with Ur brain a lil but that&#039;s also part of the fun .. so after that I said Fuck it I&#039;m going to LSD <br /><br /><br />I made my purchese from jesusofrave very clean please calm feeling with LSD good visuals (but not as strong as the 4aco) n I also noticed LSD doesn&#039;t really Fuck with r br I felt pretty normal n didnt have any weird thoughts just melo body high n visuals .... I enjoyed both very much <br /><br /><br />After LSD I did purchese shrooms from mushroomgirl(very good sller)...N those r unbeliveble .... Shrooms felt almost exactly like the 4aco ... Which I enjoyed it ... At the end I got kind of emotional which is fine with me ....I tell u one thing someone said to me &quot;LSD is in the drive side of the car and shrooms r the passenger &quot; n it is exactly like that ....<br /><br />I also tried the 2c-b which was cool to but its a lil different visuals also kind of three d but different ... Also with LSD everything was kind of melting n wiggily .... <br /><br />What ever choice u will make u will enjoy n I&#039;m sure to going to venture to different psychedelics like I have .... They r Awsome n I recommand to try everything at least once just make sure u r in a good mood n good environment :) .... N u purchase from a good seller ...hope I helped

				i haven&#039;t done shrooms in some time, but imo it seems like most people experience with a &quot;mindfuck,&quot; as opposed to LSD where you are a bit more clear minded.. so imo, if that is the case, then starting with LSD is better.<br /><br />maybe it was just the dose though.. when i did shrooms a few years ago, i was at the onset of egodeath.. i was losting contact with who i was in the physical realm.

				i have never had a legitimate hallucination on psychedelics. i think classifying psychedelics as hallucinogens is misleading because implies that what you see isn&#039;t real. so if you&#039;re taking them just for that purpose you may be disappointed. visuals are secondary to the psychedelic experience. personally, they tend to affect me mentally more than visually. i typically only get strong visuals if i take a strong dose. i suggest you read this before jumping in... i feel it&#039;s necessary reading for anyone interested in these divine chemicals: http://deoxy.org/psyexp.htm (clearnet) :)

				I have done many psychedelics in my day. Shrooms, lsd, many in the 2cx and DOx family. Most of them created the usual effects, walls breathing, things melting, patterns, funky colours, even the sensation of being able to see through people (cells, neurons, etc) on what I believe was DOI. In terms of the chemical which made visuals appear out of pretty much nowhere, I would have to say 2cc. I would be looking at my boyfriend and his face was just one big rainbow fractal, and they were all around me as well. The body loud was significant and I am in no rush to use it again, but that experience sticks out to me as the most wildly visual.&nbsp;

				2c-e is fun and pretty visually intense, a little tweaky but not bad.<br />2c-i (the reason I initially joined) is more energetic and while more fun (and emotional) the visuals leave something to be desired.<br />2c-p is a LONG one, slow comeup but fun, last a good 12 hours but it&#039;s a slow burn. However you&#039;ll probably feel very hot and look pretty shitty (sweaty, tired, etc...) after about the 4 hour mark. However, at 8mg, it&#039;s basically like being sober but with visuals.<br /><br />All 2c-x chems tend to leave me feeling exausted when they wear off, I also usually feel a bit drained for the next day.<br /><br />LSD&nbsp; is nice, and easy going, it can be mentally confusing but for the most part, if you go slow and work your self up (take 50mcg more each trip) you&#039;ll learn how to handle it.<br /><br />25i, and 25c are both HORRIBLE ideas, they fuck with your blood pressure pretty badly and can seriously hurt you. Not to mention that they can mess up your ability to trip on anything else in the future.<br />(I&#039;ve only had 25c twice and I still regret it, both times)<br /><br />shrooms can be fun, terrifying, or very soul searchy and there is no real way to know what your going to get out of it each time. ...for me at least.<br />4-ho-met was fun but a little expensive and kind of odd, I got headaches and other weirdness, not to mention the anxiety got to me with this stuff. Stick to real shrooms.

				BTW, I find that with Galindoi shrooms you can effectively re-dose within a few hours and it works pretty well. I&#039;ve done this before, about 3 hours after my first dose things were dying down so I ate another 3 or so grams (dried) and got close to the first peak. I was pretty surprised actually.

				DMT is the most all-consuming in terms of visual splendour I mean if what you want is spectacular and fully whole soul-immersifying experience with colours than definitely smoke DMT and if you do a bit of research maybe try DMT with a MAO inhibitor like moclobemide or syrian rue or ayahuasca vine... <br /><br />5-MeO-DMT is one of the most annihilating experience I have ever had. It is easily for me the most absolutely terrifying of all the Hallucinogens I have tried. Just complete and endless nothingness...forever... After I had it I really questioned if that was a very good idea to see and experience the void... it&#039;s stark. <br /><br />5 grams of Psilocybin mushrooms can be as all enveloping as DMT and is the strongest visuals I have had through oral ingestion of tryptamines. <br /><br />2CB is great and beautiful visuals. say 30mg should be a great trip... very interesting visuals and for me I have never had any trouble with headfuck or creepiness... <br /><br />So yeah I reckon Psilocybin and DMT are the go. <br /><br />If you really wanna know - Psilocybin then smoke DMT and take Nitrous is the actual real deal bonafide godhead experience.

				GO DMT! no joke but after that try LSD, golden teachers (shrooms), try 25c nbome its fun buy from Navita.... (take two at once wait 1 20 mins you will be tripping balls)...... i heard 25i nbome has really good visuals as well but i heard its very unsafe so i stick to 25c as it macks lsd pretty well......

				If you want to hallucinate, then give some extra thought to setting :) Be in the dark, in a warm comfortable room in your comfiest clothes. I feel that movement and light sources distract from the experience, lessening the amount of visuals, while music might instead stimulate visuals. By removing input of data from light/movement/balance and whatnot the mind gets more susceptible to suggestion. Lying down in darkness will give you crazy visuals on low dosages. 2g cubensis, 100µg of LSD is enough to get some truly sublime visuals, mostly 2D.<br /><br />Psychedelics feel quite adaptive so the trip will be highly influenced by the circumstances. When I do martial arts on hallucinogens all visuals disappears and my balance and eyesight gets their acuity boosted and the movement feels fluid and effortless.<br /><br />I would recommend shrooms as the first drug, because of its humbling effect, but LSD works too if you don&#039;t mind tripping for hours upon hours your first time :)
