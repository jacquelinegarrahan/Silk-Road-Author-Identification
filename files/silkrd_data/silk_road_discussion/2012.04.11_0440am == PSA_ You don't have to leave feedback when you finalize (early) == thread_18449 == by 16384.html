				On some pages all I see is a bunch of &quot;FE&quot;, &quot;Finalizing Early for trusted vendor&quot; and stuff like that. None of that stuff helps me understand your liking of the product or if you even got it. Just finalize and leave the comment blank, don&#039;t press submit until you get it.

				The FE helps you understand that the seller has asked for FE. The seller&#039;s / item page&#039;s often state &quot;no FE&quot; but the seller still asks for FE. In this (frequent) cases it is good to know that the seller likely will be asking me to fe if i order from him/her. <br /><br />One other benefit is that if a seller suddenly starts having loads and loads of FE&#039;s, you can see this as a possible fraud warning. In my opinion it is quite ok to let others know about the FE but the feedback should be revised after receiving the order so it actually reflects the whole transaction.

				If you see a vendor with a bunch of blank feedback, is he getting his shit out but no one cares enough to leave feedback, or is everyone finalizing early?<br /><br />You have no idea.

				&nbsp;If a vendor has a bunch of people finalizing early, smells like bullshit to me.

				The real problem is that people who finalize early don&#039;t go back and update the feedback later.&nbsp; They just leave it as &quot;FE,&quot; which is kind of useless.

				In some cases when you have to FE&nbsp; just leave it blank. When product arrives and you SAMPLE IT take a couple minutes and give a proper review.&nbsp; I let people know if I will be doing business with that particular vendor again, how the product was and if need be any packaging or transit issues. <br /><br /><br />Kind of annoying when most of the reviews say they have not tried the product yet but it looks good.&nbsp; That tells me nothing.&nbsp; ;D
