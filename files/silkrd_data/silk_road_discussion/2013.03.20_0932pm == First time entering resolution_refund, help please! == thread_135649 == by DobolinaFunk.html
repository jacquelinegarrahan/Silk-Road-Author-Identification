				I need some assistance from my fellow roadsters! This is the first refund I&#039;ve encountered.<br />I am now on my 25th day awaiting a package that was sent from the same continent.<br />I have ordered previously from let&#039;s call him vendor &quot;A&quot; and received within 10 days, and many<br />of his other customers receive within the same time frame. I have a 100% delivery rate with about 15 total transactions.<br /><br />Now here&#039;s the catch; I ordered a larger quantity from a different vendor two weeks<br />AFTER I ordered from vendor &quot;A&quot;, and received this item within a week.<br />Obviously my address isn&#039;t flagged or I wouldn&#039;t have received this item, correct?<br />I extended the resolution 10 days, and am now approaching the 9th day.<br />The vendor is offering a 50% refund, which I&#039;m not very happy with..<br />How the hell do I know this package was even sent? Does anyone have any advice?

				Just tell us who the vendor is, this way if they are scamming we&#039;ll know. It&#039;s possible they sent it, ask if they can provide a dcn for the order. Most vendors offer only 50% as it is considered a &quot;shared risk&quot; so you shouldn&#039;t worry too much about that. You could try asking for more if you want. FYI If you are able to both come to a resolution your refund rate should stay at 0. If you provide more info i&#039;m sure we could better inform you what to do.

				The issue was resolved.. the vendor definitely isn&#039;t a scammer so I don&#039;t want to pin that on them. Thanks for your offered assistance though! I would +1 you if I could :)
