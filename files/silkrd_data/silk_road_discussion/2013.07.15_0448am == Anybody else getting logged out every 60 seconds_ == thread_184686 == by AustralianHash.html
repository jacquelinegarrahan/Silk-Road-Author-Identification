				Don&#039;t sound too good m8 get on to admin asap but I think it&#039;s probably your connection being broken causing this or something simple ie I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a ddos attack again anyway hope you get it sorted m8 all the way from UK cheers.

				Yeah it&#039;s a weird one, been happening to me on and off for a couple of days, and yes DPR, it does happen if i close browser and log back in.<br /><br />What&#039;s really weird is it does not happen to every tab....for example, i can have 3 or 4 sr tabs open to main page, account, orders etc, and i will refresh account and be told i have to login, but refreshing orders and i do not.

				I&#039;ve been logged out at random, sometimes when clicking a link in SR, like messages, sometimes I&#039;ll just go back to SR tab and it&#039;ll have logged out. Couple of times logging in has just refreshed page, no error message, always check url so def the Road, AB.

				FYI Just took me 5 attempts to login. Started getting limited capthcha&#039;s 4 letters +1 number, so I go a new identity, got a regular captcha and went in on that try. <br /><br />[Update] All good since I posted this. Looks like DPR nipped it in the bud. I too was getting kicked off randomly here and there in the last few days. No big deal. I remember when it was like that all the time, as well as taking 10 attempts to log in sometimes, back last year. We&#039;ve come a long way, and are spoiled by the uninterrupted connection.
