				been doing drugs mainly ALONE since i was 12 with little to no affect,i am now in my twenties.but i keep doing it???why?? <br />started off with inhalants and it made me feel like a was sat spinning on a massive old fashioned record player..thats all it did.<br />smoked ALOT of crack in the past-but i felt nothing,even the first time i did it i felt nothing,but i kept on doing it,even though it did not affect me...insane i know...<br />smoked heroin a few times-still nothing great,just makes me feel like vomiting.<br />exstacy makes my heart heavy and breathing difficult.<br />ive taken handfuls of benzos and it just makes me constipated,thats all it does.<br />weed makes me tired though,think thats the only drug which gives me some kind of effect besides the inhalants...i quit the inhalants a long time ago though.even when i go see hookers i dont like it.<br /><br />could i be stuck in a psychosis?<br />been reclusive for the past 6 years.extreme reclusiveness.i avoid any social interaction at all times or else i get extremely paranoid.<br /><br />whats going on?

				Wrong site for you...tons of good sites that can help your with this, on the normal web.&nbsp; I&#039;d try heroin-detox.com, or google around, or go to an NA meeting, talk to a shrink...this is a site to buy and sell stuff, not to get help for those kinds of problems.&nbsp; Good luck.

				yeah man, the best advice you could hope for from here would be how to better and more effectively use drugs,<br />which doesn&#039;t exactly seem like answer to the problem you&#039;re trying to work through at this time.<br /><br />good luck, homie.

				People on this site can help you get drugs, that&#039;s our specialty. There are many other sites that would be great helping you out with your problem.

				If you don&#039;t enjoy them or you they are causing whatever issues then they may just not be for you.&nbsp; People all react differently and some people do not get the same pleasurable effects that others do.&nbsp;

				If the drugs aren&#039;t doing anything for you don&#039;t waste your money on them. People react to drugs differently. From what you&#039;ve said about being anti social and a recluse I&#039;d suggest that the drugs are not really helping. <br /><br />Candyman626
