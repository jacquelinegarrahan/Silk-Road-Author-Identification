				The State of the Road address made it pretty clear that OOE was a big no-no due to scam concerns, and probably &#039;tax evasion&#039; as well, which I think is fair given that this infrastructure. The OOE transactions issue seemed to always imply the buyer sticking their neck out by sending btc; what about the converse? I have a few trusted customers that I will front small orders to without prior payment/purchasing of a listing. Every time I&#039;ve done this, I&#039;ve had them buy a listing asap and go through the usual procedure, but I&#039;m curious about whether or not I&#039;m &#039;allowed&#039; to simply get a direct BTC payment instead? If I&#039;m taking full financial risk, why should I have to pay for escrow?

				Out of escrow simply means shopping for an item, finding it, contacting the seller, and paying for it outside of a SR transaction,to keep SR from getting their cut. eBay bans you if you do that, because they arent a free classifieds service. No reason SR shouldnt.&nbsp; Although the recent changes they&#039;ve made are going to increase the rebellion rate, and more vendors will be taking sales off site for regular customers. Thats my forecast.<br /><br />Your talking about early finalize issues and off site transactions as if they were the same. Assuming SR gets no cut of direct transfers, then they are not getting the cut that makes them run the site in the first place. How else do you think this site is ran? I dont see any advertisment banners. Your not paying for escrow, your paying your cut to SR for the fact that your product doesnt magically get sold by itself, like I said, this isnt the local sunday shopper classifieds.
