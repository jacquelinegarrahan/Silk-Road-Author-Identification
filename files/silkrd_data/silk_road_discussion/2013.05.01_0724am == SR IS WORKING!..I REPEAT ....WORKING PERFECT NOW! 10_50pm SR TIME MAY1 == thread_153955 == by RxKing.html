				Yes this is good news, I still would love to have that ass who&#039;s behind this exposed and or possibly &quot;more&quot;. It&#039;s one thing to mess with a website that is purely for entertainment purposes this is not that. Those attacks were messing with people&#039;s income, risking dope sickness for some users and could have possibly even ruined stats. I know it&#039;s probably not going to happen but hey I can dream&nbsp; ::)

				I was on for a few hours with everything running smoothly from 11:30 pm CDT on, had a few problems with pages timing out a few minutes ago, working now fine. As someone said above, might just be all the back-to-business traffic, although I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if SR went down again for a while.

				Phew! I finally was able to log in with the Tor Browser Bundle (Firefox / Windows). I have been logging in and accessing the site just fine since last night on a...less convenient...browser. But I&#039;m glad that the Tor Browser Bundle works now!<br /><br />This means that the site&#039;s performance is improving. The reason I could access with the other browser and not the bundle is because you can&#039;t adjust the timeout settings on the bundle and they were too short for how long SR was taking to respond.

				Well I must be unlucky, when I found it was up I got 5 minutes to send out some urgent messages and then nothing. Left it till today and same thing 5 minutes to sort a few urgent things out and nothing again. :-(&nbsp; Hope things pick up as it is still unworkable for me. Grateful for all DPR and helpers work though for sure. I couldn&#039;t even post while it was down.

				SR is down for me at the moment, seems to be overloaded again, yet to be seen whether it dos or standard traffic, but orders sure have been flooding in, so I am guessing it may just be traffic.

				I was unable to get in for over 24 hours, then about about 6 hours ago I got in. Since I&#039;m waiting on a PM response from a vendor I&#039;ve been checking throughout the evening and so far, cross your fingers, I&#039;ve gotten in every time first try. It&#039;s also faster than usual!! Thanks everyone for working so hard on getting SR back up and hopefully it stays that way : (

				For me, it&#039;s been back 100% since around 5-6pm Eastern Daylight Time USA!<br /><br />These past two hours it&#039;s been lighting fast! I can flip from my account screen, open feedback in another tab, and open transaction history in another, all within 5 seconds!!!!<br /><br />Meanwhile, this forum page took almost 30 secs to load just to &#039;reply&#039; as I&#039;m doing now. <br /><br />Well I got in and I got off earlier. Which all should do. Don&#039;t browse if you&#039;re not ready to buy. Just for the next 48 hours. <br /><br />I&#039;d bought bitcoins thru Bitinstant late Friday afternoon. I&#039;d been trying all day Saturday to log in, finally after washing my car, and armour all&#039;ing the tires, I came back in before headed out for dinner, and there she was! Running beautifully. ;D ;D<br /><br />Got my 3 orders in. Speed, benzo&#039;s, and a little H for kicks. 8)<br /><br />I bought $200 USD i n bitcoins, came to 203.95 with bitinstant. As I was catapulting over to my SR wallet, I noticed it said I had gotten only 188 in btc&#039;s When consumer confidence was low due to DPR&#039;s advising it could be DAYS before it&#039;s fixed.Then the bitcoin value jumped to like $120 most likely because the site came back up! <br /><br />Can you say &quot;consumer confidence&quot; ??<br /><br />Well, thank God for that, because by the time my btc showed up in my SR wallet, it had grown to $212.00 ! ! !<br /><br />Well that worked out for me! (2nd time in a year where that happened.)<br /><br />Carry on people. Be careful, tell no one of this special place. It&#039;s like the mafia. We were not really here!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />-Chip<br />
