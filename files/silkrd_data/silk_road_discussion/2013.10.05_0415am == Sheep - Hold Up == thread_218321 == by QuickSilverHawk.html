				Seconded USASupply, I was going to say the same thing, everyone needs and expects to acquire a rebound as fast as possible only for their satisfaction, total disregard to safety and common sense.<br /><br />I even find it shady to be charging $89 or so to vend, and now they charge $200....they said it was to keep scammers away, if that was the case they should have always had it $200. (Im seeing it as the 3 letter agencies just want to take even more BTC ...and raising the price now is a good way to do that if one of them or similar agencies did run it).<br /><br />

				Logo = black sheep: noun -&nbsp; 1. A member of a family or other group who is considered undesirable or disreputable. 2. A person or thing that can not be trusted.<br /><br />They raised the price not for the money but because a .89 (even a 1.3) btc seller fee is laughable. It should not be a &quot;fee&quot; it should be a bond, refundable. They raised the price expecting the influx and knowing any reasonable vendor would not take a .89 btc bond seriously, anybody could do it. SR was good at 600, 600 is a decent risk for people just starting up and that was the point, you can scam just 1 person on .89/1.3 and make a profit. But that&#039;s not the point. These people are making these places for PROFIT only and can not be trusted. We here in the SR community love profit but we understand This is so much more and many people are DONATING their time for the revival.<br /><br />&nbsp;I know for a fact Sr will be back better than ever, 2.0 is underway and this is confirmed. We have lost too many people in this battle, some must be loss for a war to be won, but it was more than needed. I know people in need will need their stuff, but anybody who will not be going through withdrawals and is concerned for their safety, help with 2.0 or sit and stay in the community until completion to give support. It will never be finished without community support, nobody is getting paid keep in mind. The only way it will work if there is incentive to develop it. If everybody goes to sheep or BMR permenantly, SR will be a thing of the past and 2.0 will be lost. Sheep and bmr will never surpass SR and will most likely always be a fraction of what we once were. 2.0 will be just that, better. More buyers = more vendors, more vendors = more buyers. Stick together guys! remember... united we stand, divided we fall.<br /><br />Excuse my rants, we are broke and tired, and ready to get everything back in order.<br /><br />

				We don&#039;t have high hopes or confidence in sheep either. I can imagine them amassing a slew of coins in escrow and then hitting the kill switch and absconding with all that coin leaving buyers and sellers on the hook. <br /><br />Really feeling the loss of SR. Hurts all the more knowing how SR got taken. Our fearless leader didn&#039;t practice what he preached.

				I have no idea whether or not Sheep market place will turn out OK or not, wil have to wait for dust to settle. Even if its not a honeypot there&#039;s going to be a lot of scamming going on, and its security protocols are untested. I will not be basing my decision based on the associations oif the word &#039;sheep&#039; that&#039;s for sure.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BMR has at least been going for a while and so has established vendors and feedback,&nbsp; but just doesn&#039;t seem to meet my particular needs (and is fucking fucking slow as fuck.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its back to the street for me for now. Can get everything I want cheaper (if not always as consistently high quality) than SR anyway, but I miss the choice and the excitement of waiting for the postman!

				Just like any breakup after a relationship, I&#039;ll be taking a break from the game for a little while and regroup. I advise everyone else to do the same. Don&#039;t make rash decisions just because your bitcoin wallet hurts. <br /><br />Take a break and go back to the way life used to be, get your head straight. It&#039;s safe to say that a lot of us could be a bit delusional about the safety of using services like this due to Silk Road&#039;s long and seemingly invincible run. Examine and be skeptical of the whole online black market scene just as you were when you first found Silk Road. I sure as hell won&#039;t be getting anywhere near this scene again until I&#039;ve gotten my security measures as tight as possible and a place emerges that has proven itself to be as secure and legitimate as SR.<br /><br />EDIT: Security from three letter agencies aside, who&#039;s to say that BMR/DeepBay/Sheep won&#039;t capitalize on all the SR refugee&#039;s flooding their sites? Once they amass a peak level of BTC it seems like a great idea to retire the site with that massive lump sum than to keep it going and face the fate of DPR....

				The fact that they raised the vendor price implies it&#039;s not a trap.&nbsp; A sudden drop in price, or a signup discount, would be more suspicious.<br /><br />I&#039;m not defending the place, just making a point.

				Aside from the name of the site (I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to work out what&#039;s LE or not based on names), can someone name the exact risks?<br /><br />If it&#039;s a honeypot and vendors and customers are using PGP then what&#039;s the difference? Even if customers don&#039;t use it (which at this point would be fucking astounding), all they&#039;re going to catch is buyers, right? And even then, assuming they&#039;re going to try and go after big buyers/IRL sellers (the ones that don&#039;t use encryption), which means they&#039;re going to have to facilitate a lot of actual drug deals where people get drugs and dealers get paid before making a couple of larger, but still essentially small, busts...<br /><br />Am I missing something here? The real risks I&#039;ve seen linked to this market are security risks that frankly go over my head, and are related to external elements gaining control of servers or whatever... I believe that, but does a LE actually setting up the market make much sense?

But I do agree that it&#039;d be taken down eventually.<br /><br />To be honest, ANY hidden site associated with drug transactions is vulnerable to takedown. First it was TFM. Then SR. In between those two, OVDB and Atlantis both folded. So whether we&#039;re talking BMR, SM, or SR 2.0, all are on the radar of the US government.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really comfortable joining ANY site that was conceived here and whose construction/design/implementation was discussed on these forums. That&#039;s not smart, especially so soon after SR was taken down. This should be done privately.<br /><br />And I know the name isn&#039;t trademarked, but I think it&#039;s shitty to build a site based on someone else&#039;s idea and using the reputation/credibility built by them. Also, I think it gives people a false sense of security as SR was one of the most secure black markets ever created. Out of respect for the hard work and dedication of DPR and his staff and volunteers, any new marketplace should have a new name. If there was no contingency plans for this kind of situation, then SR should be allowed to rest in peace.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve been poking around on http://6zyze2mkwyla7jwe.onion and am unimpressed at this point. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think that not having &quot;listings&quot; will help. If it&#039;s successful, it will eventually draw media attention. After that, it&#039;d end up being in the same position as SR was, right square in the middle of the government&#039;s cross-hairs. There are three problems: people can&#039;t keep their fucking mouths shut, it&#039;s hard to generate sales without publicity (obviously it takes a good deal of revenue to keep these sites running, and a smaller user base would lead to much higher fees), and the media gets way too fucking involved once word gets out(it&#039;s one thing to report on SR, but why do they have to buy drugs, take screenshots, and publish photos of their merchandise and its packaging?) The first Gawker article, while it rapidly increased the user base, is what first drew the ire of the Feds. From there, Pandora&#039;s box had been opened. All of the articles and statistical analyses of SR that were published did far more damage then anything DPR said publicly (including the fucking Forbes interview that a lot of people are trying to blame for this -- I read that article; absolutely nothing significant was revealed in it).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
