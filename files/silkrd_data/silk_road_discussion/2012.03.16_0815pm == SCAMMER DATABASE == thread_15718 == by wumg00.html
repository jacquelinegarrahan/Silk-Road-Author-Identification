				I KNOW THERE IS ALREADY A STICKY FOR &quot;REPORTED SCAMMERS&quot; AND SEVERAL POSTS, BUT YOU CANT FIND ANYTHING IN THERE IMO. ITS FILLED WITH PAGE AFTER PAGE OF POSTS,RANTS,REPLIES AND GENERALLY USELESS INFORMATION. I AM SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE ONE CENTRAL LIST OF REPORTED SCAMMERS THAT WOULD BE UPDATED PERIODICALLY (ON A WEEKLY BASIS FOR EXAMPLE) AND IT WOULD BE FORBIDDEN FOR PEOPLE TO POST THEIR COMMENT, RANTS ETC AS TO KEEP THE LIST READABLE UNLIKE THE CURRENT LIST WHERE I AM UNABLE TO REALLY FIND ANYTHING.&nbsp; THERE COULD BE A SUB-SECTION OR SOMETHING FOR THAT OR THEY CAN JUST USE THE CURRENTS FORUM AVAILABLE FOR THAT. I THINK THE BEST WAY TO RUN IT WOULD BE TO HAVE THE LIST LOCKED SO ONLY THE MODERATOR CAN UPDATE IT AND TO PUT SOMEONE ONTO THE &quot;SCAMMER&quot; LIST, THEY WOULD MESSAGE THE MOD IN CHARGE OF THE THREAD, EXPLAIN THE SITUATION THAT THEY BELIEVE JUSTIFIES PUTTING THE PERSON THEY IDENTIFY ONTO THE LIST AND THE MOD WOULD THEN UPDATE THE LIST ACCORDINGLY. I THINK THIS WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR BOTH VENDORS AND BUYERS ALIKE AND WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE HAVE NOW. I HOPE THAT THIS GETS READ BY THE RIGHT PERSON AND BECOMES REALITY!

				I like your idea and feel it&#039;s a necessary thing. Though, I&#039;m also thinking of a different or other implementation.<br /><br />There should be a Vendor subsection on the forum with each vendor on SR having a thread. Only vendors or moderators/admins can create these vendor threads. In these threads users can discussing all sorts of matters that are specific to the vendor and their product(s). Vendors can address concerns or announce new products, change in products, etc. <br /><br />I would like to read how vendors deal with their customers to gauge that personality of the vendor. I&#039;m fortunate enough to deal with the best vendors on SR. And my list is short. IN fact I just added a new vendor to my short list. You know the vendor as Galindoi. I wish i had discovered this vendor sooner. But all things in their time. He came highlu recommended to me and exceeded my expectations. <br /><br />There may be other great vendors out there, but I just don&#039;t know about them. That&#039;s why they need a vendor thread in a vendor section of the forum. It could be subdivided by specialty with vendors having threads in multiple specialties. <br /><br />I avoided a vendor by reading a thread in the rumor mill. Turns out the vendor was a scammer and started a new seller indentity. If I relied on his feedback alone, I would never have detected that he was a scammer. But that thread was buried on page 4 the day I just happen to be reading about a convo I posted to the day before. <br /><br />See what I mean? <br /><br />Need a better vendor profile section than the rumor mill.

				<br />That&#039;s a great Idea about vendors having private Scammers lists that way you people have access and control of your products so there would be less loss to profit margin.Just don&#039;t allow vendors to stop supply because he doesn&#039;t like the person(s) or Country they are from

				CharasBros Selective Scammer.<br />You must Finalize Early. You have no choice. I had a previous successful transaction and realized the risk. Nowhere else to get this quality hash at this price. Package seized by customs. Sent CharasBros proof. They refuse to accept liability. Shitty packaging. Easy to detect. They have 20+ sales a day, can afford to be weasels.<br />BEWARE<br />Buy at your own risk.<br /><br />Update......<br />Offered to reship when he (CharasBros) receives a customs letter as well.....!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Do you think he put his return address on package???<br />What a goof....

				Instead of a scammer List , you need a CERTIFIED AND LEGIT VENDOR LIST !!!<br /><br />You see,&nbsp; you make a List of tested and approved vendors.&nbsp; Vendors can only get on the list if they meet the criteria.&nbsp; The list holder secretly buys product randomly from vendors in the list to test them out and rate them.<br /><br />Vendors would want to be on this list.&nbsp; They would strive to be on the list , like a better business beurau.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Vendors could also pay to be on this certified list.&nbsp; Their membership fee covers the random tests and they can learn how to improve their operation as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the membership.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get on the list if you are vendor.&nbsp; Promote the list as the list administrator .&nbsp; Post it in the forums daily and offer subscriptions to the list.&nbsp; Buyers can rely on the latest list to pick vendors from.&nbsp; It narrows it down to legit vendors who have been tested randomly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think of it as a feedback system on steroids.&nbsp; &nbsp;It can&#039;t be faked or manipulate like the SR feedback system. <br /><br />The SR feedback system is manipulated by vendors who put up a listing for a cheap amount and buy it over and over, so they can make good feedbacks and then delete the small amount listing .&nbsp; Nobody&#039;s none the wiser.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen these feedbacks done within minutes of each other that don&#039;t add up and refer to things that the vendor doesn&#039;t have or do. Hehe.<br /><br />You see feed back that is all fantastic and then one in the middle that is 1/5 and it makes no sense .&nbsp; Or feedback that refers to things that aren&#039;t there or overly positive thanking god and the world for like a gram of weed.&nbsp; Jeese.&nbsp; <br />Anyway, I love SR and all it&#039;s vendors and I don&#039;t want to cry conspiracy or anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s only a few.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure someone will correct me.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is why I think a 3rd party rating and feedback system is important.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be biased .

				It is hard to follow the scammer thread as you stated. <br /><br />But the best way to stay safe is to treat everyone as if they could be a s scammer or LE. Even well known and trusted vendors have gone bad and either started selectively scam new people or even asking a bunch of people to FE then jet. Trust no one ever. <br /><br />Follow the rules and use the escrow system. Never FE or use money packs because you are just asking to get ripped off. I really wish they would get rid of FE. It would cut down on some of the drama here.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the time a mod could go through the complaints then post them a scammer could rip people and be history long before complaints could be posted. <br /><br />Also would put mods in a difficult position of determining what complaint to post leaving them open to all kinds of accusations should they fail to post a complaint about someone. Not to mention putting the mod or whoever monitors the thread onto the position of editing or remove posts on a free speech site. <br /><br />Maybe something like a complaint form that gets posted where you post your name, vendor, what happened and when with only allowing a limited number of characters. Then it would get posted without review. You could even give the person who accusations are made against the chance to reply with their side of the story.<br />&nbsp;
