				So just looking at the movie review site http://www.rottentomatoes.com (clearnet) and noticed a new flick - &quot;The House I live in&quot; is currently in theaters.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a 96% thumbs up rating. <br /><br />Oh yeah - it&#039;s about the US&#039;s war on drugs; how it came about, the dismal results and the abject failure of the whole thing. <br />Personally I&#039;m convinced that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; will start winding down soon. It&#039;s days are numbered. Aside from being cost prohibitive it&#039;s almost totally ineffective and creates more shattered lives with non-violent people in rotting in jail. And drugs are still readily available in everywhere. <br /><br />Anyone here seen this flick? Anyone have any opinions?

				I&#039;m looking forward to it, I saw an interview with the director Eugene Jarecki and I like the cut of his jib.

Personally I don&#039;t think drugs provide depth or real insight, but a lot of people into psychedelics seem to disagree with me, so maybe it really works that way for some.<br /><br />This punishing of people for wanting to satisfy their needs or dull their pain is as medieval as burning witches at the stake.&nbsp; I doubt anything other than weed will be legal in my lifetime though.
