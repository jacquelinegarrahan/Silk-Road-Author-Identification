				Well I tend to adhere to the belief that time is less a line and more a tree; each and every event, even the smallest most insignificant events like the unexpected movement of a subatomic particle or something like that branches off into its own new line of time. Therefore, to me, time is not a linear event but a series of diverging and converging paths. I partly believe this because a certain part of me wants to believe that time travel is, in theory, possible, and this belief solves many temporal paradoxes people argue about when they talk about time travel.<br /><br />I also believe in the multiverse theory where basically beyond the universe, in the &#039;void&#039; , there are an indefinite amount of constantly shifting plains stacked on top of each other, waving and moving in ( mostly ) synchronous patterns, and universes are formed by the occasional point in which two of these plains connect with each other. For this I sort of believe in a more macro version of my time belief where there are different diverging paths where certain universes aren&#039;t even created, or are created differently, so and so and so, etc.<br /><br />So if you were to go back in time and change something, you would only start a new branch on the tree as opposed to completely changing the future. Likewise, the future you might visit will invalidate itself basically since your presence upsets the natural divergences in time, so when you go back to your own time you can&#039;t really rely on the information you receive from the future. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s enough of my batshit theories... I&#039;m just a big science fiction fan, is all. I have faith in science and feel like the capacity of mankind is far more than some people feel it to be.

				So I wrote this a few weeks ago when I woke up... you know how sometimes you think you know everything at the crack of dawn?<br /><br />The Universe Is a single atom whose perceived multiplication creates the perception of time.<br /><br />I woke up this morning with a deep and profound understanding that space, time and mater were all abstract manifestations of a singular quantum structure. That there was no multiplicity to the existence of creation, no big bang, no separation or differential distinction between identified parts. <br /><br />A total fundamental shift in my perception of the universe from that of infinitely diverse parts parts creating a whole, to that of a singular speck of nothing whose movement creates what we perceive as time and that through our perception of time we view this singularities evolution as separate incarnations of mass. Everything that we know, see and understand is nothing more than the cascading vibrations of this particle. <br /><br />I fundamentally understood at the core of my being that I had actually unlocked a key to understanding the universe that could forever change how we evaluate the laws of physics. That if we started to evaluate the universe from the perception of a sustained singularity of which we are all composed, then the rules of our universe could shift from a study of what is out there to a study of what is in us. <br /><br />In my mind, at that moment, the tiniest speck of dust on this planet could finally be understood as being the totality of everything.<br /><br />Not sure that it helps in the conversation but thought I would toss it out there.

It exists because we observe it. If we did not have any means to measure the passage of time, then it would not exist. That&#039;s like saying magnetism doesn&#039;t exist because you can&#039;t sense it with your body. It is observable, therefore it is real<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>existence and illusion are not mutually exclusive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think you have a better grasp on the scientific definition of time than the entire scientific community, who keep striving to find methods to more accurately measure time. Every device you use works because of the concept of time. GPS is the best example. If we could not calculate time, we would not accurately be able to sync up the position of GPS satellites with the earth, and we would not be able to obtain geosynchronous orbit. There are physical methods used to define these properties, because as we know humans are completely unreliable<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>that&#039;s completely irrelevant to what i said. i never claimed to have a &quot;better grasp on the scientific definition of time than the entire scientific community.&quot; you respond to my comments as if you have no idea what i&#039;m saying, and talking that way isn&#039;t going to help you understand any better. thanks anyway for the know-it-all attitude!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I possibly don&#039;t understand what you mean because you made a one sentence statement? If you made that into a question, I might not have to assume to know what you mean. But your right, I&#039;m totally an asshole for reading a statement and making an assumption ::)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i never said you were an asshole, but you do have quite an attitude. there&#039;s no reason to talk down to someone like that during a civil discussion just because we don&#039;t share the same views. i have no desire to prolong an argument about the existence of time, so carry on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My intention never was to talk down to you, and if it was perceived as such i do profusely apologize. However to me the concept of saying time is imaginary is fairly silly, and i am merely expressing my sincere disbelief that someone could believe that notion. If that was/is perceived as rude i am sorry, just very surprising to me<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>oh, i didn&#039;t mean to say time is nonexistent! i meant illusory as in deceptive, not unreal. sorry, i guess i should have clarified.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That would have made much more sense in context. The way it was just made you sound like you were babbling(no offense). Now that i understand what you mean, yes i am in complete agreement. That&#039;s what I&#039;ve been saying the whole time. Time is both subjective and objective. Objective in that we can measure it with physical instruments and everyone can be on a universal clock/schedule, but subjective in the way we each perceive the passage of time, due to our own body chemistry and the substances we take that influence it. Both points of view are correct, but they are most definitely not mutually exclusive<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>no offense taken. i understand why it sounded that way to you. i think it&#039;s pretty funny that we agree after this big miscommunication. i&#039;ve got nothing but love, didn&#039;t mean to butt heads with you! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh totally. It&#039;s funny I&#039;ve had similar reactions like once or twice in a videogame(of all places) where the guy apologized for being an asshole and we became friends(i was the more dickish one here). I generally have no long lasting hate for people as long as we come to a mutual understanding and neither of us were wrong in the first place&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>got to be the most massive quote pyramid I&#039;ve yet seen on this site

Because everything that is faster goes backwards in time and this we can not measure with our senses or equipment in any ways. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What you are mentioning is a part of the theory of relativity. Relativity states that the closer a mass moves to C(light speed i.e. E=MC^2) the more time dilation that object experiences. There was a great and famous thought experiment called the twin theory. It went something like if you have two identical twins, one staying on earth for a year and the other moving away from earth at light speed for half a year, and then back to earth the other half year, would they be the same age? The answer strangely is no. Speed would effect the way we experience time. But it doesn&#039;t because the relative velocity to experience any sort of time dilation is massive and would physically rip you to shreds. No matter can be accelerated to a velocity of C, it is a cosmic speed limit that no matter may pass, as light is not a particle with a mass.<br /><br />As to things &quot;traveling backwards in time&quot;, you would merely experience it that way. The reason for this being that you would actually have passed the light from that time period. If you and the sun came into existence at the same time, and the light emitted from the sun was the same speed, and you moved at the same velocity as light. You would see absolutely nothing in front of you, because the light is not fast enough to reach in front of your eyes(facing forward).&nbsp; So you turn around, but nothing is changing. Time is &quot;frozen&quot; as you see it. Why? Because the light hasn&#039;t move relative to you! While you may both be going at the insanely fast speed of C, to each other you aren&#039;t moving. You are exactly the same speed, therefore you experience no progress visually. This also applies to all other sensations, because none of your other senses or impulses are able to move anywhere near even 1% of C( again the speed of light). So essentially you are &quot;frozen in time&quot; until you slow down to a speed where all other physical properties of the universe can be processed.<br /><br />Now lets say you are going 2X C. Suddenly you are beating the light. If you could say stay conscious and actually see this, you would see the light receding. This is what we see when we look into the old universe. This is what scientists and astronomers use as proof of the big bang. When you away from an object you experience what is known as a &quot;redshift&quot; of light, meaning it shifts towards the red side of the spectrum. We see such a large redshift when we look into the deep deep cosmos, that we can calculate our speed from the origin point of the universe. They have calculated that we are moving faster than the speed of light away from the big bang. This means that through classical means of transportation, using all the science we know now, we will never be able to get there. EVER. This is again because C is the cosmic speed limit.&nbsp; As far as we know, nothing can pass it. There have been mathematical models that show we could perhaps pass this speed limit, but it is all theoretical, much more complicated than even what Einstein&#039;s theory&#039;s have told us
