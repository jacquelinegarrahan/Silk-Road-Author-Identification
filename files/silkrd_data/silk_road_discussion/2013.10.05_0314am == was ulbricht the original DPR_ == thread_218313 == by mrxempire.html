				I remember hearing rumors a few months back that the Dread pirate Roberts had stepped down and another one had taken his place. Then, in september, Roberts himself admitted to being the &quot;successor&quot; to the original during his forbes interview. However, according to the DEA reports that I read earlier this week, they had actually been tracking ulbricht since July 2011. Does this mean that Ulbricht was the one and only Dread Pirate Roberts this whole time? Maybe claiming he was not the original was his way of trying to cover up his tracks. Or maybe Ulbricht was an assistant for DPR during the lifetime of SR, and took the helm after the original decided to step down. What do you guys think? Can anyone confirm any of these theories? I&#039;ve heard various opinions so far. I like to&nbsp; believe that the original DPR is chilling on the beach right now drinking mojitos, or even better, coming out of retirement to help build the next SR.<br />

				I think it&#039;s interesting that in the YouTube interview with Rene Pinnell, which took place December 6, 2012, Ulbricht says that he just moved to San Fran 3 months prior.&nbsp; And it was to help Pinnell with a &quot;startup&quot; he was involved in.

				No way. The whole cavalier attitude, the WSJ interview. The person representing themselves as DPR back in 2012, when I first found the road, was pissed about the Gawker article and loathed that (for want of a better word) journalist. <br /><br />As far as the DEA saying something about tailing someone.....yadda....yadda...yadda - Are you taking a Nazi at his word? <br /><br />Think.<br /><br />From here on out we can speculate, but we&#039;ll never know the facts. Since I was born, everything on TV, especially the News has been for the most part lies. All the information they try to feed us, is written, produced, edited, choreographed, you name it, by the very same people in Hollywood that make the movies everyone flocks to like moths to a flame. <br /><br /><br />How about the news they &quot;wont&quot; report on? How about an unarmed black woman, with a baby in her car, gets assassinated by DC police, but you barely hear a word about it! Who gave the order to kill her? Where is the outcry? Was deadly force really necessary? - Oh, nevermind, we gotta find out if Obummer spoke with Boner today, and what expression was on Boner&#039;s face. <br /><br />Maybe that&#039;s why those &#039;Federales&#039; assassinated that unarmed woman. I heard one reporter, calling the murderous police &quot;Heroes&quot;&nbsp; and how &#039;they&#039;re not getting paid because of the &quot;Government Shutdown&quot;!&nbsp; I hope they pay them soon, who knows what they&#039;ll do next? And they want to take guns away from law abiding citizens? What a country.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then every newsbreak on the radio(no TV in this house) - &quot;Government Shutdown&quot; - Really? It doesn&#039;t seem to make a difference, but damn if the press isn&#039;t scouring every small town pennysaver for something to justify their fear mongering. I say every day the Gov&#039;t closed, that&#039;s less money being spent on an already obese useless conglomerate of agencies. <br /><br />Let&#039;s move on. Talk very little about sensitive things. - Use PGP in all PM&#039;s and emails, for anything you wouldn&#039;t want someone else to know. <br />I used to scoff at the PGP proponents. In reality I was lazy, or afraid of something new and possibly complicated. Then Snowden, a modern day hero, blew the whistle on the NSA. - The first real true news we&#039;ve heard in a while. I started paying attention to PGP and everything I can possibly learn about online security. <br /><br />I feel as though I live in the former USSR, in the mid 1970&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />Find out all you can about security online. How you can be tracked, etc. If you have Chrome - delete it. -- Then get Revo uninstaller, and delete the rest of it. I had hundreds of files and registry entries all related to Google, and this was after I uninstalled Chrome! Delete your Facebook account. All that social media bullshit. It may have been developed innocently enough, but it didn&#039;t take long for the demonic shadow government to use it to track and control us, in their insatiable desire to control.&nbsp; <br /><br />We can hypothesize until Christmas what really went down. Or we can all concentrate on how to stay one step ahead of those who want to control us. No more blatant Vendor reviews, is one thing I&#039;d like to put out there. Obviously many of us will end up on another site. There are more than you think. - I say, if someone comes on a forum and says - &quot;Is Vendor X good?&quot; - They should get a yes or no answer. - You want more info? PM someone and see if they&#039;re willing to tell you. - and if you do, you both should do it with PGP.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I&#039;m taking away from all of this. - Meanwhile we have worse criminals running the country. Don&#039;t worry, as the saying goes, &quot;What doesn&#039;t kill us, makes us stronger&quot;<br /><br />Let&#039;s all get stronger. Stronger encryption. Stronger sense of safety. For ourselves, and those like us. I don&#039;t know what else to say. I&#039;m exhausted though. Barely slept since that bright red screen popped up. <br /><br />Take it easy. - You&#039;re one of a million people with that same question on their minds. - I&#039;m not faulting you for asking it. I&#039;m just saying. Don&#039;t say anything. This is like being on display in Macy&#039;s window. Just remember that.<br /><br />Oh, and my guess? -&nbsp; Ulbricht was a fall guy. Quite possibly paid to take the fall. Some sort of loyalty to the group. This is no one man operation. Also the whole reason for the name Dread Pirate Roberts, has a meaning. You may already know, but for those who don&#039;t, see the Princess Bride. I&#039;ve never seen it. Not my cup of tea. Though you can just go on Wiki or IMDB. In short, the title of DPR is just that. It&#039;s a position that is held by different people over time. <br /><br />I like the mojito ending myself. - I&#039;ve also heard that there is a contingency plan that&#039;s been in place, and is on a fail-safe, or auto-pilot. We&#039;ll see! <br />Sorry for the negative rant. - I&#039;ll end on a positive. <br /><br />You never know what tomorrow may bring! <br /><br />&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; Chip&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />PS. Beware of new sites, also (I noticed the new postings while typing this)-when you viewed that video on YouTube, were you logged in to Gmail?<br />Yes I&#039;m paranoid. Can you blame me?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I wonder if the feds investigated Rene Pinnell at all. (since he knew and associated with Ulbricht ----or maybe Rene was helping the Feds?!)<br /><br />But to answer the OP, I dont believe Ulbricht was the &quot;Original&quot; however peoples beliefs do change....or are masked at times...anything is possible.

Some investigative reporter, huh?&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />***<br />EDIT: actually I just went and looked at what I wrote in the chapter.&nbsp; I wrote:&nbsp; &quot;The user ‘altoid’ on Bitcointalk apparently deleted those early posts (or the site did), which can now only be found quoted in later members’ responses .&nbsp; However, altoid remained active on the Bitcointalk forums until August 2012.&quot; <br /><br />Now it seems odd that I didn&#039;t spot the gmail addy.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to go back and check, but bitcointalk is down.<br />It seems even odder that one of the journos that did the massive investigations trying to uncover him (e.g. the guy who wrote &quot;The hunt for DPR&quot; or whatever it was) never found it. Maybe bitcointalk gave up deleted posts to the FBI?<br />***<br />&nbsp;<br />I don&#039;t know what the hell I would&#039;ve done if I had found the email addy though. I certainly never had any intention of &quot;exposing&quot; anybody. <br /><br />No idea who the admin was he put a hit on. I assume it was an admin on the main site, which doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they had an active role on the forums.

There&#039;s also emails from me to Wordpress trying to get them to show me what silkroad420.wordpress.com&nbsp; looked like before it was removed for violating wordpress TOS.

				Thanks for the response. Fascinating. If the FBI really did get bitcointalk to release &#039;deleted&#039; posts to them, it must have been on a pretty desperate whim.

The whole cavalier attitude, the WSJ interview. The person representing themselves as DPR back in 2012, when I first found the road, was pissed about the Gawker article and loathed that (for want of a better word) journalist. <br /><br />As far as the DEA saying something about tailing someone.....yadda....yadda...yadda - Are you taking a Nazi at his word? <br /><br />Think.<br /><br />From here on out we can speculate, but we&#039;ll never know the facts. Since I was born, everything on TV, especially the News has been for the most part lies. All the information they try to feed us, is written, produced, edited, choreographed, you name it, by the very same people in Hollywood that make the movies everyone flocks to like moths to a flame. <br /><br /><br />How about the news they &quot;wont&quot; report on? How about an unarmed black woman, with a baby in her car, gets assassinated by DC police, but you barely hear a word about it! Who gave the order to kill her? Where is the outcry? Was deadly force really necessary? - Oh, nevermind, we gotta find out if Obummer spoke with Boner today, and what expression was on Boner&#039;s face. <br /><br />Maybe that&#039;s why those &#039;Federales&#039; assassinated that unarmed woman. I heard one reporter, calling the murderous police &quot;Heroes&quot;&nbsp; and how &#039;they&#039;re not getting paid because of the &quot;Government Shutdown&quot;!&nbsp; I hope they pay them soon, who knows what they&#039;ll do next? And they want to take guns away from law abiding citizens? What a country.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then every newsbreak on the radio(no TV in this house) - &quot;Government Shutdown&quot; - Really? It doesn&#039;t seem to make a difference, but damn if the press isn&#039;t scouring every small town pennysaver for something to justify their fear mongering. I say every day the Gov&#039;t closed, that&#039;s less money being spent on an already obese useless conglomerate of agencies. <br /><br />Let&#039;s move on. Talk very little about sensitive things. - Use PGP in all PM&#039;s and emails, for anything you wouldn&#039;t want someone else to know. <br />I used to scoff at the PGP proponents. In reality I was lazy, or afraid of something new and possibly complicated. Then Snowden, a modern day hero, blew the whistle on the NSA. - The first real true news we&#039;ve heard in a while. I started paying attention to PGP and everything I can possibly learn about online security. <br /><br />I feel as though I live in the former USSR, in the mid 1970&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />Find out all you can about security online. How you can be tracked, etc. If you have Chrome - delete it. -- Then get Revo uninstaller, and delete the rest of it. I had hundreds of files and registry entries all related to Google, and this was after I uninstalled Chrome! Delete your Facebook account. All that social media bullshit. It may have been developed innocently enough, but it didn&#039;t take long for the demonic shadow government to use it to track and control us, in their insatiable desire to control.&nbsp; <br /><br />We can hypothesize until Christmas what really went down. Or we can all concentrate on how to stay one step ahead of those who want to control us. No more blatant Vendor reviews, is one thing I&#039;d like to put out there. Obviously many of us will end up on another site. There are more than you think. - I say, if someone comes on a forum and says - &quot;Is Vendor X good?&quot; - They should get a yes or no answer. - You want more info? PM someone and see if they&#039;re willing to tell you. - and if you do, you both should do it with PGP.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I&#039;m taking away from all of this. - Meanwhile we have worse criminals running the country. Don&#039;t worry, as the saying goes, &quot;What doesn&#039;t kill us, makes us stronger&quot;<br /><br />Let&#039;s all get stronger. Stronger encryption. Stronger sense of safety. For ourselves, and those like us. I don&#039;t know what else to say. I&#039;m exhausted though. Barely slept since that bright red screen popped up. <br /><br />Take it easy. - You&#039;re one of a million people with that same question on their minds. - I&#039;m not faulting you for asking it. I&#039;m just saying. Don&#039;t say anything. This is like being on display in Macy&#039;s window. Just remember that.<br /><br />Oh, and my guess? -&nbsp; Ulbricht was a fall guy. Quite possibly paid to take the fall. Some sort of loyalty to the group. This is no one man operation. Also the whole reason for the name Dread Pirate Roberts, has a meaning. You may already know, but for those who don&#039;t, see the Princess Bride. I&#039;ve never seen it. Not my cup of tea. Though you can just go on Wiki or IMDB. In short, the title of DPR is just that. It&#039;s a position that is held by different people over time. <br /><br />I like the mojito ending myself. - I&#039;ve also heard that there is a contingency plan that&#039;s been in place, and is on a fail-safe, or auto-pilot. We&#039;ll see! <br />Sorry for the negative rant. - I&#039;ll end on a positive. <br /><br />You never know what tomorrow may bring! <br /><br />&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; Chip&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />PS.
