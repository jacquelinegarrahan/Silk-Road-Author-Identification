				Am I the only one who&#039;s noticed a massive loss in reliable vendors on sheepmarket and BMR since SR went down? It&#039;s pretty annoying, I can&#039;t seem to find anyone who I used to buy off on here. Can anyone comment?

				Give it time. I use to deal with a lot of sellers in the UK, and they were always the first to spread and last to regroup.

				I may join one of them ,&nbsp; but I lost a fair amount.<br />So will have to stack some more money and continue researching these new sites until I will take the risk of using them

				Buy what? Personal stuff?<br /><br />Weed is available from the UK. Cher is back doing MDMA and LSD from Spain, not UK but she&#039;s really good at stealth. <br /><br />Things will pick up.

				MrCronk is on Sheep and BMR, and I&#039;ve bought a couple of times from them. The Herbalist is also on Sheep, and although I&#039;ve never bought from them some people in the Sheep forum have already received next-day orders from there! I think a few of the more cautious people (who can afford to I guess) are laying low to see how it all pans out...

				I&#039;m on both BMR and Sheep Market, not UK vendor but EU with good stealth. I had many UK customers and will continue to supply the highest quality organic connoisseur buds, to EU peeps. Next harvest will be up for sale mid November for now I have hemp filters till then.<br /><br />Peace :)

				A lot of us are pretty stuck for the vendor bond due to losing all BTC we had, we have products etc but unable to register as vendors until we find a way. I know a few others are in the same boat.

				I think Shine69 has gone hiding, I did a search for him 2-3 days ago on the forums and he has deleted all threads that he started.<br /><br />Not seen any comments from him on the forums since the seizure too<br /><br />Would be a shame to lose such a trusted and high quality vendor.
