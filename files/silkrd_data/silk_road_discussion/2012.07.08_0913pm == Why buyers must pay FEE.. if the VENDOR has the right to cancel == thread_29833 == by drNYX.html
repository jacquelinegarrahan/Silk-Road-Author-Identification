				YES! I agree with you. I&#039;m curious as to why I have to pay a damn fee when I didn&#039;t even receive my product after the vendor I was going to order from cancelled. I&#039;m now a few btc poorer because of this faulty systematic response. WTF SR?!

				Yea, I&#039;m not a big fan of this either and probably wouldn&#039;t of noticed had I not read someone post about it then look back at my transaction history.&nbsp; As someone else posted on another thread, I believe it&#039;s faulty logic and not greed.&nbsp; Maybe DPR can chime in and give us a conclusive answer as to why we get charged fees on a canceld (hedged) order.<br /><br />By the way, I don&#039;t hedge only because I feel BTC will go up on average.
