				First my stats: <br /><br />Total transactions: 8<br />Total spent: à¸¿111.68<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 3 months<br /><br />As you can see, I have never gone through resolution and have had flawless transactions thus far.&nbsp; My situation is that I am waiting on an order shipped domestically (US) via regular fist class mail.&nbsp; It has been 8 days in transit.&nbsp; Many days longer than any other order.&nbsp; The resolve button has just become available, although I still have a number of more days until auto-finalize.<br /><br />I believe, based on vendor&#039;s good reputation, that the order was shipped.&nbsp; My question is, do I click the resolve button? I have not had a response from the vendor in three days and that last message was essentially that the package will get there eventually. How long should I wait to click resolve...especially since I THINK the package was shipped...<br /><br />This question wouldn&#039;t be needed if vendor would respond and provide some information, but that is not the case.&nbsp; Just cannot fathom why it would take this long.

				AIve had the same problem, it just went to 10 days. On the tenth day SR Support send yuo a PM asking tou to resolve or finalise.<br />I&#039;d wait a few more days, and when you get the PM fro SR, copy paste itPM it to him saying you have no choice but to click resolve if he doesnt respond, that&#039;s all i can say, <br />hope it helps.<br />

				I hit resolve on the 12th day not because I was worried but I was going to be away from my computer. I explained this to my vendor and they just added the 7 days that I requested.&nbsp; If you will have access to your computer just wait give the vendor a chance without having to deal with the resolution you would probably have about 9 days before autofinalization

				why not wait till there is 2 days left since it can take 21 days to Europe most of you Buyers think this is the DAM STOP &amp; SHOP mail is out of all vendors controls so give them a break sending 15 emails a day don&#039;t help except get vendors PISSED off wait till there is 2 days if vendor doesn&#039;t reply then you will usually get a full refund<br /><br />call your postal service and ask them IT CAN TAKE UP TO 6 WEEKS FOR PARCELS TO GO OVERSEAS AND THAT IS USING A TRACKING # NOT UNUSUAL FOR CANADA POST&nbsp; sometimes takes 21 days to the USA from Canada

				Sorry For The Meltdown There Are So Many New Buyers Scamming Vendors<br /><br /><br />well there is a reason there is 17days for delivery if buyers would wait till there is 2 days vendors don&#039;t end up pissed off and receiving emails is just outrageous as we receive some of the dumbest <br /><br />letters like I paid for shipping and want my tracking # then they go to resolution and want a full refund 8 days later from the order time mean while they never ordered tracking #(always extra with any vendor) <br /><br />I no buyers are scared they are being scammed ( yes some vendors live on the 50% refund policy ) they never send a parcel and then just click 50% refund SR may except and settle the resolution.I think all parcels should go tracking # only problem is we will lose a shitload of vendors because they are security wise and cautious.<br /><br />all I am saying if you trust the vendor wait till there is 2 days left sometimes mail is slow and HOLIDAYS delays mail by 3 days anyways so.Now if it is a new vendor yes I would wait 10 days and then click resolve as It may be a scam<br /><br />there are vendors around that will try to get buyers to FE Please for your own safety DON&#039;&#039;T if you do you have no case for dispute with SR and they can&#039;t Help if you stay in escrow you have a great chance of getting your coins returned

				The proper way to handle this situation is simply to message the vendor and mention that the package hasn&#039;t shown up yet.
