				Hey<br />Im needing some advice on finding a reliable dropbox for receiving international orders that i deem to risky to be sent to my household, there is great profit to be made in the region that i live but due to certain factors including me sending personal amounts of product to my home (i wouldnt want my real address to be on the mailmans shitlist, i still need my green) i am not wanting to get these international orders shipped to my&nbsp; current address.<br /><br />I would also be looking at setting up a vendor account to sell certain wares if i can get this idea afloat, any information or guidance would be much appreciated, and if you would like to communicate in private please drop your email or any other form of communication here and i will be keeping a keen eye on this thread.<br /><br />Thanks!

I want someone to receive all my incoming mail, but i don&#039;t want any of the risks. But all the mail goes to me eventually. Don&#039;t worry, for you sticking your head on the chopping block, I&#039;ll be sure to cut you in on the profits that which you are the sole basis for.<br /><br />Who in their right mind wouldn&#039;t just cut out the middle person?

				Not sure if you understand the whole idea of a dropbox? hah.<br /><br />Im not looking for someone to willingly receive my illegal goods with full knowledge of whats going on, im looking for a totally random address (possibly abandoned?) to get goods sent to so that my name is not attached to said goods in any way, im asking for tips on how to find such a letterbox.<br /><br />This is not going to get the person who is named on the letter in any sort of trouble as we all know packages can get sent to wrong addresses or a variety of things could have happened and in this case the receiver is fully innocent anyway (it just means if a dropbox gets compromised i can still continue with business using another address), it also means i can continue to order personal amounts of goods domestically to my own address and can continue to do so even if my dropbox gets compromised (My real address wont be on the posties shitlist).<br /><br />This is common practice on SR, maybe you have been living under a rock?<br /><br />Still looking for real advice from people who know what they are doing!

All i can see is me getting an order shipped to a random address instead of my own. Who is this middle person that im cutting out that you speak of? I hope your not talking about me cutting out the person who&#039;s address i&nbsp; would be using to get the good sent to? Would you like me to knock on there door and say &quot;hey, here&#039;s the thousand bucks i owe you for getting grams of narcotics sent to your address, wouldn&#039;t want you to feel like you&#039;re missing out on anything.&quot;.<br /><br />Honestly is this the first time you have heard of dropboxes being used to receive narcotics in the mail? Or am i seriously missing your point lol

				Ok<br />Pretty sure i just figured out what you mean, but...... THE PERSON WHOS ADDRESS IS RECEIVING THE GOODS (&#039;THE MIDDLE PERSON LOL) IS NOT AWARE THAT ANYTHING IS BEING SHIPPED TO THERE HOUSE.<br /><br />Sorry about the caps dude but you still havnt clicked as to what i am trying to accomplish here, i will be using an address of someone who is unaware the drugs are being shipped to there house (they are unaware anything is being shipped for that matter), i will check the box without anyone seeing me and will pick up my package without the knowledge of the owner of that letterebox, moral of the story, there is no middleman its a random address.<br /><br />This has been explained 3 times now, i did not want this thread to be derailed by people who have no clue what the meaning of a &#039;dropbox&#039; is, hopefully this thread will get back on track and some people can start throwing real ideas into the mix (in private if needed).
