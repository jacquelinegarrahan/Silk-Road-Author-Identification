				Fast and probably the only response to a deluge of spammy crap. However, for one, the system does not work regardless whether you enter a correct catchpa or not.<br /><br />Also, for busy vendors this is a major pain !!<br /><br />May I suggest and seek thoughts from others on two suggestions.<br /><br />1) make the catch-pa system work, recognize correct inputs and offer resolutions for incorrect as oppose to an invalid link and a kinda dead end.<br /><br />2) remove this need for all vendor accounts. I see very little chance of spammy scumbags paying $500 for a vendor account so they can send spam and get banned and lose their money.. FREE accounts are for spammers.

				I was referring to the recent addition of catchpa to the SR messaging system.<br /><br />Which at the moment, at least, means I cannot reply to any of my customers :)

				These issues will be ironed out as soon as possible folks; please ensure you&#039;re using the latest update to the Tor Browser Bundle (if applicable). Some users are reporting that they think it may be a captcha time-out issue and that their problem is resolved if they refresh the page before typing the captcha and hitting send. This would make sense and I&#039;ll make sure DPR is aware of it.<br /><br />Libertas

				Maybe it would be a better idea to have to go through the captcha before you type your messages, one captcha being enough to send 5 messages or being able to send messages for a set amount of time before retyping it. It would make it easier for vendors that get a lot of PMs, and refreshing the page after you finish typing your message is pretty annoying which is why having to fill the captcha before having access to the message sending form would be a good idea.
