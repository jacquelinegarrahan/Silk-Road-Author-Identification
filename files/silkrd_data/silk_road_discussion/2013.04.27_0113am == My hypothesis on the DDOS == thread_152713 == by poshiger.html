				Good theory.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suspect it was all bitcoin related too.&nbsp; The same guys did it to the exchanges, the. They hit Silk Road to experiment and examine with how it affected the market.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, they know what they needed for future manipulation tactics. <br /><br />I have a feeling a lot of legit businessmen want out of bitcoin because of coming regulations.

				i just think its those guy at atlantis might have either come up with it or been threatened with &quot;pay us and we ddos your competitor for 1 month or dont pay us and we ddos you instead for 1 month&quot;. i saw some similar type of extortion threat posted by another member recently along those lines of internet business.<br /><br />atlantis will get5 a massive influx of users due to it.<br /><br />i also read somethying about how to ddos an onion site was only recently discovered if i recall correctly the past 3 weeks.<br /><br />if any of these are the case i very much fear the survivability of sr.. i lived through the attacks on irc dalnet and those attacks totally killed dalnet<br /><br />i have no idea how ddos can be thwarted

				At this point it&#039;s all just speculation as to who is behind the DDOS but I personally am never going ti use that atlantis site. If they are in any way involved in this then fuck them and fuck their shitty business practices. If it wasn&#039;t them I&#039;m sorry but still not ever going to use it. I&#039;ll be sticking with DPR til the end.

				I&#039;m having trouble with the whole bitcoin theory of the DDOS. Yes, SR is the undisputed largest retail site that uses bitcoin as it&#039;s currency of exchange, but the trick there is that it *is* used for exchange. Investors hold a lot more (bitcion) money than SR&#039;s tiny volume. I don&#039;t know very many people who have and use bitcoin, but even I know one investor who holds more in bitcoin than DPR makes in a year.<br /><br />It&#039;s more plausible to me that this is orchestrated by a government agency, or multiple government agencies. Silk Road *has* been in the main stream news recently, remember. (Why is it that bitcoin cannot be brought up in a news piece without SR being mentioned?) The last time Silk Road popped up in the main stream press, politicians in Washington were climbing all over themselves to get to a microphone to announce how horrid and evil Silk Road was, and how it &quot;needed to be taken down.&quot;<br /><br />Well, they didn&#039;t take SR down. And since politicians have the attention span of 5 year olds, as soon as it was out of the news, the urgency died. But now it&#039;s happened again, and &quot;cyber warfare&quot; is now a thing, so governments are more capable. There&#039;s no reason at all to think that some bureaucrat might have sparked a brain cell and decided that the surest way to get rid of this moral anathema is to make it inaccessible. And, in government terms, a DDOS attack is cheap. VERY cheap, and very easy to sustain for a long period of time.<br /><br />Just my idea, and no, I have no proof that a government agency is behind it.

				I can&#039;t really see denial of service working as a long-term strategy, if SR goes down for an amount of time we&#039;ll just see more alternatives spring up. SR is profitable because they are a trusted party and can take their cut as an escrow, but if such centralized parties are routinely destroyed then someone is bound to write decentralized market software based on a web of trust.<br /><br />The worst possible scenario is that that attack is part of some trick where the fix for it causes SR to expose themselves in some other way. I don&#039;t know how plausible that is though. <br /><br />We should really prepare for SR vanishing one day though, communication lines between vendors and customers would allow us to transfer the trust we&#039;ve built up across future marketplaces. <br /><br />Save the public keys and email addresses of your favorite vendors, just in case!
