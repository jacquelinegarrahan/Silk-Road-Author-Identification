				In light of recent events such as the arrest of TOR mail founder and FH going down, in addition to other security concerns, is it time that we make it possible to transfer your stats to to new account under a different username, different password, and different PIN?<br /><br />I have great stats on my marketplace account and i do not want to lose them because vendors appreciate users like me who haven&#039;t had problems in the past. I like my stats because it means vendors are more likely to do business with me. It&#039;s a great system. However, it may help to throw LE of the trail of some SR members if DPR implemented a way to change your username or to transfer your stats. <br /><br />This could be especially useful for those members who have used their account name on other websites (clearnet or otherwise) or those who want a little piece of mind for their security. <br /><br />Not sure if this would accomplish much but i would certainly feel more safe if i could keep my stats but change my name once a year or once every 10k spent, or something like that.<br /><br />tl;dr I want to keep my stats but operate under a different username.

				I asked DPR about this directly, considering my clients who&#039;s details I compromised.<br /><br />His response (which he&#039;s also already sent to someone else who made the request):<br /><br />&quot;This is not easily done and our policy is to not do it. Normally you would need to start over with a new account. If you want to be 100% secure, that&#039;s what you&#039;ll need to do, because things like feedback can still be linked to you.&quot;<br /><br />BG

				I would definitely be on board for this type of action. It would be great for vendors because they are under a lot of scrutiny and it would probably be hard to prosecute a vendor if they kept changing their name every few months. Probably would need new warrants and other types of stuff.

				I would consider changing my name even without receiving the feedback again in the first place. I think the only thing a vendor would care about is the 300+ transactions if their accounts are used frequently,the rating next to their name, and the time that they have been a vendor(I wouldn&#039;t be opposed to losing this one either if necessary). I would be happy if all the text feedbacks were deleted upon creating the new account

				If your stats go with you, your feedback goes with you too. That would make changing your name pointless since your feedback comments are often unique to you. <br /><br />Besides, what would changing your name actually result in if your stats are kept? It will look funny and make someone want to research who you might have been. <br /><br />Vendors can&#039;t change their name and still have the same listings if they expect to fool anyone. <br /><br />For buyers, just start a new account. That&#039;s truly the best way to break from your old self. If you practiced basic security you have nothing much to worry about. If you didn&#039;t and you&#039;re worried, start a new account and consider losing your stats as tuition. <br /><br />BTW, scammer &amp; LEO accounts would also love the ability to change their name without having to start again. Think about that. <br /><br />

There are already a number of veteran buyers with perfect stats who use their stats to scam relatively new vendors by way of feedback blackmail.

A prime example of unintended consequences.<br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about compromised Tormail or Freedom hosting accounts being linked to your SR username because you used the same there as here, consider that without metadata that de-anonymizes you, the compromised information is useless. But if that compromised data does identify the true you and some of your activities, changing your username on SR would be akin to playing a shell game where the shell you&#039;re under is the only bright yellow shell on the table.

				something has to change, some of these buyers are already using multiple accounts freely.<br /><br />as sellers we are constantly at the mercy of self-serving crooks who hide under the guise of anonymity.<br /><br />buyers accounts should cost money to obtain, and accounts used for harassment or scamming should be frozen including the sign up fee and any funds within the account.<br /><br />that would keep at least some of the scum at arms length.<br /><br />buyer feedback would also be a great idea that shouldnt be too difficult to implement, and with the added security of &#039;buyer account bonds&#039; these vermin would actually stand to lose out if they are found to be abusing the system.<br /><br />also, a 100% correctly answered SR basic facts Q&amp;A checklist should be required before an account is issued to keep fools from placing orders and then asking the most ignorant of questions over &amp; over again and then threatening buyers with negativity for not answering dozens of mails immediately.<br /><br /><br />tl:dr - buyer account bonds, buyer feedback &amp; 100% Q&amp;A site checklist before account is issued would be a good start<br />

Normally you would need to start over with a new account. If you want to be 100% secure, that&#039;s what you&#039;ll need to do, because things like feedback can still be linked to you.&quot;<br /><br />BG<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It sucked being a noob with no stats.&nbsp; Being one of your customers that was compromised I would welcome a change but don&#039;t want to start over again.&nbsp; I wish there was an option for this.
