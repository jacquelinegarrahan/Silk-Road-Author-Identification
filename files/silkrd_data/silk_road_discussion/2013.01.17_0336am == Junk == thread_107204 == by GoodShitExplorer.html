				That life is far too short, not to do what you want to do, when you want to do it. Also that the world in it self is a incredibly beautiful place, that is unfortunately filled with loads of evil people. <br /><br />You take something with you at the end of each note worthy LSD trip, some times small things, some times ground breaking..but always some bit of new understanding. Good luck friend.

				+1 for the seeing through other eyes/perspective idea.<br /><br />I honestly feel like LSD allowed me to truly live in this world.&nbsp; I was always kind of a dork in high school.&nbsp; Great grades and some friends and a hot girlfriend.&nbsp; But crazy born again christian and all sorts of other nonsense I believed.&nbsp; Was never really happy.<br /><br />The first time I took LSD I drove up to a rave by myself several hours from home (first rave).&nbsp; I ended up taking MDMA and LSD for the first time.&nbsp; And I took way too much LSD.&nbsp; Sent me to another dimension.&nbsp; Not going to get into the experience but let&#039;s just say it was beyond intense and I ended the night lying in my car imagining cops were pointing and laughing at me right outside the windows.<br /><br />But afterwards I finally started being able to understand people by thinking about how they could perceive the same things that I did differently.&nbsp; This seriously was the most significant event in my life.&nbsp; Since then I have had an amazing life I can&#039;t even begin to describe here but LSD was like the key that opened my understanding of people.&nbsp; I stopped being a dork and started having fun, enjoying life, and having true relationships with others that weren&#039;t all driven by my silly selfish motives.<br /><br />If you are debating whether you should do it you should definitely try it at least once.

				I had a great time on LSD and got to experience the whole interconnectedness with the universe/beauty of nature/oneness of all feeling. Then I had a strange and terrifying experience on 2C-I that was kind of the opposite lol. Made it very clear that everything we experience is simply a mess of chemicals in our brains. The only thing that makes us &quot;real&quot; is the world around us, especially other people. That&#039;s why we have senses instead of just being part of an all-encompassing cosmic imagination where everything occurs at once.<br /><br />Perhaps we return to that everything/nothingness after death, but right now we&#039;re here to live in reality. We have no way of knowing what&#039;s beyond the consciousnesses bound to our brains, and it&#039;s like that for a reason.

				Well both i and a friend quit smoking after a lsd trip where the lsd somehow told us to quit smoking it was something about this foul burning sensation that spread from the lungs and all over the body when smoking a cigarette during the trip. Sadly i have started smoking again. Why are cigarettes so good when drinkin sigh..

				I learned not to look on the mirror whilst on LSD... lol (I was told, I ignored)<br /><br />I also learned that a single life is so utterly random and meaningless in the grand scheme of things, that it is not worth getting upset or suicidal over mostly anything,<br />and with that:<br />Having a chronic lifelong illness isn&#039;t so bad. I shouldn&#039;t dwell on the bad things as I am still 90% able to what I&#039;d like, and anything I can&#039;t do can be replaced by something equally stimulating and enjoyable.<br />and with that:<br />I stopped being so depressed and suicidal, tidied all my rubbish away, gathered all my possessions and moved out of my parents house within 1 week.<br /><br />I lasted about 5 months on my own before being admitted to hospital just after christmas for severe weightloss and malnutrition. I&#039;d been too fatigued to cook for decent meals for myself properly without having to lay down and take lots of codiene &amp; tramadol.<br />and with that:<br />I learned that the only true barrier in life, aside from prison, is physical pain.<br />and with that: <br />I&#039;m now on the strongest prescription painkillers and carrying on with my life pretty well.<br />-for now.<br /><br />Above all that LSD taught me that life is precious, nature is beautiful and the only way to beat negativity [or &#039;evil&#039;] is with positivity.&nbsp; love your friends, but love your enemys too<br />

				Thankyou GoodShitExplorer, +1<br /><br />My depression came back after that long hospital stay (over a year) But the painkillers work well at keeping me happy. (normal feeling. not high)<br />So In attempt to try to further help my outlook of life, I sought out more LSD again.<br />(after my ex-junkie half brother, who&#039;d started smoking cannabis at 13, etc etc alcoholic, heroin addict, stole it from my hiding place whilst staying in MY apartment whilst I was in hospital still paying rent. - He was using my gas and electricity, didn&#039;t bother topping up the meter and over £100 worth of food went bad. along with medicinal cannabis food.<br /><br />-I&#039;d previously found it helps improve any neurosis quite well, but doesn&#039;t come from nowhere, you need to work on it. for instance I had a complex with eating fruits that I&#039;d grown in the garden, through fear that I wouldn&#039;t be able to remove all the Larvae or bugs brought by flies.<br /><br />After a breakthrough realising that all life on earth (and the universe) is all from one source, therefor we are all mostly &#039;one&#039;, made from the same universal materials and built in the same way. Aside from forms of life that have evolved mechanisms not to be eaten, which i could easily rule out. I told myself that we&#039;ve evolved stomach acid and enzymes to digest and excrete most living matter, so there&#039;s no chance of being &quot;body-snatched&quot; by a little insect.<br />after all, Sunday dinner on &quot;Im a celebrity, Get me out of here!&quot; is basically grubworms, kangaroo testicles, eyeballs, snails, etc etc. and if a false-as-fuck celebrity can do it...<br /><br />I went out in the garden and picked an Alpine strawberry, flicked off any bugs and ate a few of my own fruits for the first time(amusingly seeing any on-board lifeform as &quot;extra protein&quot; - lol)<br />It was amazing, like highly concentrated sweet strawberry/raspberry syrup. It was raining at the time and I felt so euphoric as I watched the clouds morph around and change colours. It was exactly like the Skittles advert where the clouds part and it rains skittles! eating fruit is great on acid, but fruit you&#039;ve grown.. thats something else.<br />(these are unrelated to regular strawberries. a MUST for anyone who&#039;s grown cannabis and/or has an open mind to the beauty of growing medicinal plants, interesting fruits, herbs etc.)<br /><br />Also, the neurosis would extend to things like chicken and other meats, you know those little dark vein-like strands you get through the breast, or mostly in the wings/ legs or thighs.<br />I completely ignored this and started eating a whole free-range chicken with a knife and fork. even eating the reddish or slightly dark meat and skin, fat etc(which I now know to be tons more nutritious than the outer breast, since its the part of the muscle that&#039;s worked by the animal and contains protein bound with hemoglobin, along with Omega fats that are essential for proper brain function.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed a few things since getting more LSD, that pain is mostly all in the mind, and can be bypassed with deep meditation or simple distraction (if no other coping mechanisms are available, or you&#039;re already on painkillers and don&#039;t want to take more)<br />That is not to say that you need to sit there completely silent and still whenever you&#039;re in pain (I&#039;ve wasted much time doing this in the past due to doctors not wanting to spend pennies on medications) but LSD certainly helped with ignoring the pain, and realising its not real. (its about as real as the pain you sometimes feel in a dream)<br />You&#039;re perception of everything is all in the mind, and the mind can be trained to ignore it or cope with it differently. much as a child stops crying when they fall over, when they realise they&#039;ll get no sympathy from it after a certain age. <br /><br />For my next trip i&#039;m going to make sure the house is clean, or I&#039;m somewhere else as I grow to detest my cluttered surroundings and end up cleaning out the place for hours on end.<br /><br />Hope my two bitcoins have enlightened someone, If you have anything to say regarding LSD and psychotherapy, we&#039;d love to hear it!

				A lot of LSD users won&#039;t like to hear this, but I just don&#039;t get the deep, introspective experience from LSD.&nbsp; LSD is my favorite hallucinogen by far and it&#039;s, in part, because of this.&nbsp; <br /><br />To me LSD is a drug not a tool.&nbsp; I like taking it because of the visuals and high, not to contemplate the universe.<br /><br />However, I do have these intensely spiritual experiences on Mushrooms or Peyote.&nbsp; When I want that kind of experience I go with one of these.

				i found out that god placed us here and gave us &quot;life&quot; with a perception of time and reality<br />so that we would keep from going insane as we are not able to - as humans - to realize that<br />there is no time or reality.<br />we are just put here to grow as spirits and experience all things - when we are done here we<br />will move somewhere else and experience other higher things till we are complete beings.<br />there is no death - u just move on to the next level till u get it right.<br /><br />on a side note:<br />i have learned never to try and join a biker club while on lsd because the price will always<br />be to high.<br /><br />&lt;3 ;<br />Christy<br /><br />PS&nbsp; &nbsp;i had to give up taking it because i loved it too much!

				The big one for me is acceptance ,without judgement on concepts ,ideas,people.I already was like this ,but the experiences made it much more profound.And of course a deeper appreciaion of nature and all living things...<br /><br />But on side note..I.like to briefly describe a profound experience...........<br /><br />Im standing at a music festival ,with a friend watching Particle play..Im looking uo at the stage ,and feeling the music .I look up and ,another signal in my brain is sending messages...Right then ,it was as if the waves of music <br />was coming at us in large flat beams ,in the shape of a triangle..Whilst i didn&#039;t actually see a triangle,it the back of my mind .Thats how it was being processed ....Ahh its so hard to explain those moments....But thats some of those tyoe of unexplainable moments, that i relish from it..
