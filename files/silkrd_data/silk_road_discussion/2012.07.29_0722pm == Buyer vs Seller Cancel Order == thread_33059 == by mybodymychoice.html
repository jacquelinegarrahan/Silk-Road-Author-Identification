				I am just curious if there is any difference between me the buyer cancelling my order after 4 days or the seller cancelling? In terms of my money being refunded. Do i get all my coins back either way or does SR keep a small portion? I remember a vendor cancelling my order once and most of my money was refunded but not all. Just want some clarification. Thanks. MBMC

				You never get all your coins back, a small percentage is taken out before it goes to escrow. If you cancel you&#039;re refunded that amount/

				I&#039;v never understood why the buyer just simply can&#039;t cancel an order if it&#039;s not in transit yet? You shouldn&#039;t have to wait days for this option.

There has to be a reasonable amount of time for the vendor to be allowed to fill your order. <br /><br />Perhaps you should message your vendor before placing an order if you have any questions or doubts. If you want to be able to cancel tyhe minute you send the order, perhaps you shouldn&#039;t be placing the order in the first place. <br /><br />You commit to buy. Allow the vendor to fulfill his commitment to ship what you bought. <br /><br />If you wanna be able to cancel so soon, don&#039;t commit in the first place.

				I do not believe that SR charges a fee for cancelled orders. They once told me point blank that they dio not. Then if you don&#039;t get back the dollar value (if hedged) of the original order, then there&#039;s something screwey.<br /><br />BB

				All the postings I&#039;ve read on various threads say SR keeps 4%.&nbsp; My question is if I (the buyer) cancel the order<br />do I have to wait 10 days for my refund?&nbsp; It seems I read someone say this.<br />And does it count as a refund on my buyer stats?

				The 4% is the hedging fee. <br /><br />If the vendor had hedging activated for your item, the 4% belong to sr the moment you buy an item. When you buy a hedged article you&#039;ll in any case loose the 4% but you are not exposed to bitcoin value fluctuations. The&nbsp; bitcoins you get will be worth the the same in&nbsp; $. What you get back is (paid amount - 4%) +-&nbsp; BTC fluctuation.<br /><br />If your item was not hedged, you&#039;ll get the same amount of bitcoins back, but they may be worth more or less than when you bought the item, meaning you are exposed to bitcoin value fluctuations.
