				There&#039;s this guy....<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/c536b90105<br /><br />He&#039;s currently on a break I think resupplying himself with coin, but when he&#039;s back that should be good. I&#039;ve had one transaction with him personally and that went well. But it&#039;ll be worth being careful with him as obviously this would be an easy way to scam, so only send what you can afford to lose. I plan on doing larger orders in batches so as to reduce loss as he charges a flat 15% rate on all transactions.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s the Barclays cash deposit to Mt.Gox route which was said to be closing but some searching around has lead me to believe it&#039;s still going. Personally I&#039;m in the process of testing that and should have my answer by tonight. If my moneys gone in then it should still be working. Some searching around on the forums should answer any questions about how that works though.<br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; :)

				I made a cash deposit to mtgox in barclays on monday morning and was in my account on tuesday evening. Didnt take long to get the coins over to SR and get spending. Made another cash deposit this morning also... hoping to see it in by 2moz.
