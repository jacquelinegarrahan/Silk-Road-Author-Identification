				Listing by price would make it easy for scammers to be at the top of the listings.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily a good idea to allow sorting by price.<br /><br />Keep scamming vendors at the bottom.

				all of the sort options are exactly that - options.&nbsp; I would bet most people choose to sort by either best-selling product, or by seller rank.&nbsp; having the option to sort by price gives you the ability to shop around and compare what&#039;s out there.<br /><br />

				Yes I understand the scamming part of it, but I find myself with a certain amount of money in my account and i would really like to see my options all in one place. I hate slowly looking through different things i may be interested in&nbsp; trying to find what i want to spend my btc on.

				Its a no brainer, of course there should be a low to high option. If your afraid its a scammer,just don&#039;t buyit.

				I agree. If not a sort by price option, why not let us filter search results via a custom price range? That way we can find exactly what we need and the penny-auction type &quot;scamming&quot; will be ignored.

				They had that option in the past but when I used it the prices were never in the correct order, some of the high dollar stuff was mixed in with the cheaper stuff. I have a feeling because some people tie their price to the dollar and others to bit coins that the software was unable to accurately list the lowest and highest price items in the proper order since some were priced by bits and others by dollars.

				Yes this would be great. Often I want to find bulk deals or small samples, it can be time consuming to sift through all of the listings
