				Hi all I&#039;m here just to say that buyers should have a round table on vendors too cos I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some real childish vendors who will deal with a buyer F, the buyer then go back to the vendors round table and spread lies about you to stop other vendors dealing with you this is why I think a buyers round table or section should be born so that we as buyers can explain fully on every transaction that went wrong so that some childish lying vendors don&#039;t stand a chance to go back and lie what do you lot think why should the vendors have a so called round table section where we the buyers can&#039;t see or read what&#039;s being said it&#039;s not fair so I think one should be born asap for buyers too which in turn gives the vendor a chance to respond so EVERYONE can read it ok let me know what you think people cheers, phoboss.

				No a specific area where vendors cannot see what we&#039;re saying about them like we the buyers can&#039;t see into their vendors round table like a problem area where things actually get solved not he say she say didn&#039;t you understand fully or grasp what I was saying ie why have the vendors got a round table so they can say what they want without us seeing it now do you understand if not never mind ok

				ah ok I see what you mean now. <br />I dunno if we really need that. It&#039;s sometimes good to hear both sides of the story. just my opinion though :)<br /><br />One problem, how would you stop vendors from making normal user accounts to see what&#039;s been said ?<br /><br />

				How would you keep vendors out?<br />You can just create a new account, spam to 50 and shazaaam, you&#039;re a regular SR forum account guy/gal.<br />I think this forum IS the roundtable, as we can review vendors openly.&nbsp; Vendors can defend themselves, but really it&#039;s the weight of many voices that will change opinions of a vendor, no matter how much they plead their innocence in scams, etc.<br />I understand why you want what you think you want, but I just don&#039;t see it being very effective.... I&#039;m always reading stories about how such and such a person has been buying here and is opening a vendor account.&nbsp; So it&#039;s pretty easy to think that many vendors are also buyers.

				I don&#039;t really see a need for this.&nbsp; Buyers already have a place (this forum) to talk about issues.&nbsp; The vendors that are doing all the hard work to bring us our orders are the ones that need a specific place for them so they can discuss whatever they need to discuss in order to protect themselves and others.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m quite sure that there is a bit more scamming happening to the vendors than to the buyers on a regular basis.&nbsp; Which again just reiterates why vendors need a specific private place to alert other vendors.

				Vendors don&#039;t arbitrarily report users unless there is a legitimate reason (attempt to scam, unjustified low feedback, etc).

				i totally agree with the vendor roundtable. i am not a vendor but they def have to take alot <br />more of the risk in the transaction. thats a tool for them to at least try and combat the scamming.<br />for us we have the rumor mill and feedback. what more do you really need?

				The Vendor Roundtable isn&#039;t that much of a shady place where vendors conspire against poor customers. It&#039;s more about vendors trying to reach other vendors and cooperate. I have learned many things from other vendors kind enough to share their knowledge that have later been directly or directly implemented into my business. I have yet to see any kind of conspiracy there...so I don&#039;t see much use for a customer Roundtable...that of course I would join with my other non-vendor account I have here.

For example, one vendor might notice a lot more mail than normal hasn&#039;t arrived and want to check to see if this has been happening to other vendors. it doesn&#039;t need buyers clogging up the post with their stories of what&#039;s arrived and what hasn&#039;t.

				As many people have reiterated, it would be entirely pointless to have a &#039;buyers roundtable&#039;. In essence, this whole forum, particularly &#039;the rumor mill&#039; act as a buyers roundtable.<br /><br />To the person who commented saying most vendors probably are buyers as well, this is very true. I am a relatively new vendor and I started as an SR buyer over 7 months ago. I still buy items all the time. If I ever have an issue I would post about it in the rumor mill, leave bad feedback, or in some circumstances bring it up with resolution centre.<br /><br />As far as the vendor&#039;s round table goes... well I was just granted access to it and it&#039;s not like its anything special. It&#039;s basically a place where we can share information that is relevant to ensure that SR mantains itself. The scammers list is priceless. For a pretty new vendor like me who is only just starting to get scammed. (buyer mantains he never received 2 oz yet is located same province and I have over 90 confirmed transactions none missing. he also admitted his landlord checks his mail for him)&nbsp; it is a really great place.<br /><br />You have to remember, vendors are taking immaculate risk in doing what they do, and they also have to deal with the escrow system. They are very easily scammed and must take precautions against this to keep their business running.<br /><br />To whoever said that all buyers should have access to the vendors table is ridiculous.<br /><br />So the general public, law enforcement, anyone who&#039;s made purchases on SR should be able to see what we our discussing in private TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES TO YOU?<br /><br />Absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />In all, I think that you guys have a great buyers roundtable. It&#039;s called Silk Road Forums.<br /><br /><br />-th

They are very easily scammed and must take precautions against this to keep their business running.<br /><br />To whoever said that all buyers should have access to the vendors table is ridiculous.<br /><br />So the general public, law enforcement, anyone who&#039;s made purchases on SR should be able to see what we our discussing in private TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES TO YOU?<br /><br />Absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />In all, I think that you guys have a great buyers roundtable. It&#039;s called Silk Road Forums.<br /><br /><br />-th<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>before I had access to it, I thought the vendor roundtable would be a whole lot more exciting than it is too. It&#039;s really not.

If a problematic buyer were listed on a public list they could just start over on a new acc./ and continue scheming and scamming unhindered. <br /><br />That was just 1 reason, for other reasons, just ask someone else or become a vendor. :-X<br /><br />Lol.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I&#039;ve gone over the 3 pages to my OP so far and I still think a spiteful vendor or childish vendor could easily blacklist someone at the drop of a hat when in actual fact the buyer has really done nothing wrong this is what pees me off the only logical answers I&#039;ve had is let everyone see into the vendors round table and this wouldn&#039;t be a problem in my eyes as every order has a time date order number etc etc anyway to the vendor or vendors who said they&#039;ve got a vendors account and a buyers account I&#039;d just like to ask those this, what are you hiding????

There is no need to derail multiple threads with the same discussion - this way nobody&#039;s freedom of speech is being infringed upon, no threads will need to be considered as &#039;needing to be locked&#039;, and the discussion can continue in both threads without impeding free discussion for all. If this doesn&#039;t work out and fails to keep everybody happy by ensuring that all discussion remains free, open and on-topic all at the same time, the threads will be merged back into their original topics (which is why I referenced them in the title).<br /><br />Unfortunately due to the way that the thread split feature works, the first post split is seen by the forum software as the thread starter; it is not &quot;defamatory&quot; as nobody is being defamed.<br />The reason that my post which Razorspyne quoted in his response (the initial post in this thread) was not brought into this thread is because it was replying to a poster stating that &quot;this is not how a democratic society works&quot; in regards to having a closed Vendor Roundtable. Razorspyne&#039;s post was completely off topic, and was carrying on his opinions from numerous other threads - having nothing to do with the issue of the Vendor Roundtable being a closed forum.<br /><br />I assure you that if this doesn&#039;t work out, the threads will be returned to their original topics. This is simply a way to try and keep everybody happy and ensure freedom of speech whilst also ensuring that discussion can take place on the issues at hand, and discussion can also take place on the off topic issue.<br /><br />Community members are complaining that mods &quot;aren&#039;t doing their jobs&quot;, but then when we are seen to be doing our jobs people complain about that as well.. ???<br /><br />Libertas
