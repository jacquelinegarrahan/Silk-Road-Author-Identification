				UPDATE: Ok, we&#039;re back up again.&nbsp; Unless there are any more unforseen hangups, we should be back to normal.<br /><br />UPDATE: Spoke too soon.&nbsp; One of the changes made is not working out.&nbsp; We have a solution, but it is going to take more time.&nbsp; I won&#039;t rest until we are back to business as usual.&nbsp; Please hang in there and I will give you an ETA as soon as I can, but that might be a couple more hours.<br /><br />UPDATE: If you haven&#039;t noticed, we&#039;re live again.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience!<br /><br />UPDATE: Best guess is we&#039;ll be down for another 6 hours, so 1700 UTC or so.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know if that changes by much.<br /><br />just and FYI, Silk Road will go down for maintenance today.&nbsp; My hope is we&#039;ll only be down for about an hour, but sometimes these things can take a few hours.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post here if anything doesn&#039;t go as planned.

				Thanks for the update. I&#039;m curious, I wonder what happens when the server is down for maintenance and you have a BTC transfer coming into SR. I guess the transfer keeps doing its job as I do see confirmations happening on Blockchain. Wonder how that works when the destination wallet is &quot;offline&quot;.

				I hope we get some new security features, so that the &quot;SR Quick Buy Scam&quot; or the guy who scammed some vendors last week,&nbsp; (his nickname was &quot;SRAdmin&quot; and he scammed 2 BTC from some vendors) can´t be happen again.<br />The &quot;SR Quick Buy Scammer&quot; is really scary because if a normal hacker can change some vendors pics and add his own BTC adress, than the DEA also can do something like that, or not ??

				A countdown or posted notice on the login page detailing scheduled maintainence to come would be a nice little addition . just like a day ahead of time. So people doing coin transfers vendor orders etc. Would know&nbsp; of time.

				You know, I appreciate DPR&#039;s updates and I think they put everyone at ease. But just a thought - if not some last minute technical issue, why not give an advance warning of maintenence? Say something to the affect of &quot;SR will be down for maintenence in about 4 hours. Might be down for 2-6 hours&quot;.? What&#039;s the harm in giving a heads up? Would make life easier for vendors and buyers and I don&#039;t see any security compromise in giving somewhat of an advanced notice instead of after-the-fact. <br />Thoughts?

				Some people need to just chill out. When the site went down before, people were asking DPR to at least tell us next time. Since then, he&#039;s been quite forthcoming with technical issues and communication. He seems to have listened. Now you&#039;re berating him for not telling you at least a few hours before.<br /><br />A lot of can&#039;t do right for doing wrong.<br /><br />I for one am appreciative of the updates.

				I have been a member over a year now and this is probably the 6th time I seen this happen, so just call it a nite and site will be fine in the morning:)&nbsp; &nbsp;Only once I have seen the site was down for a whole week and that was quite some time ago but DPR was not even aware of the situation until a few day&#039;s of it being down, it only took about a day after he was aware for it to be back up and the rumors were crazy!! For him to advise us so quickly of this I am sure it will be quickly handled, they must check for security issues and other thing&#039;s before bringing it back on-line. I have 12 orders I sent today I still have not been able to put in transit so for vendor&#039;s this is should worry us more than buyer&#039;s and I have doubts it will be fine, vendor&#039;s usually are allowed on first for us to mark order&#039;s in transit before open to the public. So take a nite off from SR and enjoy yourselves!!! Business will resume tomorrow like normal. Have a good nite SR community!!<br />PC

				^that. It&#039;s not DPR&#039;s fault, but seriously.. why haven&#039;t they upgraded their servers? I understand TOR is slow.. but the forums are &quot;fast enough&quot;. So is BMR sometimes, and many other TOR sites. <br />You&#039;d think what all that $ they make in commissions from sales.. they could... maybe.... upgrade from a 28.8k modem to a 56kbps? Is that too much to ask for? One of the reasons we happily pay a premium for this drugs on the site is because of the convenience of it all. And vendors charge slightly higher prices because they have to pay SR a small commission.. which is totally fine, but.. you&#039;d think they&#039;d invest in the architecture. One thing SR has taught me is patience. I think I&#039;ve developed more patience since I started using SR then I ever developed in my IRL experiences.. because sometimes theres nothing you can do but patiently wait 2 full minutes for a page to load, only for it to time out.

				My theory is there is or was some issue, maybe minor that needed taken care of.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think this is a planned thing,&nbsp; and that is why no previous warning is given.<br /><br />Also I would imagine that the security precautions in place on the road are really complex and need constant monitoring.&nbsp; &nbsp;( do you think there is ever a day when someone isn&#039;t trying to hack or attack the site )<br /><br />Would DPR pick a better time to do regular upgrades?&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; right?&nbsp; I would think so.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But think of it this way,&nbsp; if they came on here and said.... shit.... that wasn&#039;t supposed to happen, hold on to your asses.....&nbsp; &nbsp; what do you think would happen?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Think of the movie MIB,&nbsp; &nbsp; when the old guy said, there is always a death star or greasy alien virus, and what keeps this planet from panic is that they do not know about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; okay that wasn&#039;t a exact quote, but you get it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Just look at the history of down times,&nbsp; yes it takes slightly longer then predicted,&nbsp; coins are always worked out and I can&#039;t remember any losses that were not corrected.&nbsp; &nbsp;So relax,&nbsp; let will smith,&nbsp; I mean DPR and the crew handle the romulan death gun,&nbsp; and I promise you,&nbsp; it will be back as soon as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />* it isn&#039;t being a sheep, this is and has been a work in progress,&nbsp; I am thankful, as most seem to be.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is always amazing to see jerkface rude people with attitude about any down time&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp;I can tell you this,&nbsp; if I was DPR and I saw the rude ass comments I would probably tell you to kick rocks and make your own road.&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; however this would be a full time job considering.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The end.

It&#039;s not DPR&#039;s fault, but seriously.. why haven&#039;t they upgraded their servers? I understand TOR is slow.. but the forums are &quot;fast enough&quot;. So is BMR sometimes, and many other TOR sites. <br />You&#039;d think what all that $ they make in commissions from sales.. they could... maybe.... upgrade from a 28.8k modem to a 56kbps? Is that too much to ask for? One of the reasons we happily pay a premium for this drugs on the site is because of the convenience of it all. And vendors charge slightly higher prices because they have to pay SR a small commission.. which is totally fine, but.. you&#039;d think they&#039;d invest in the architecture. One thing SR has taught me is patience. I think I&#039;ve developed more patience since I started using SR then I ever developed in my IRL experiences.. because sometimes theres nothing you can do but patiently wait 2 full minutes for a page to load, only for it to time out. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah... Definitely not trying to sound ungrateful at all, but the forums seem like lightning after browsing Silk Road for awhile. There has to be a better solution. I know SR has a ton of users, but relatively speaking, it can&#039;t be all THAT many, when compared to popular sites on the clearnet. The servers could definitely use an upgrade. Shit, I&#039;m sure people would DONATE just to have that happen.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Noone needs to donate anything. SR already makes a ton of money with sales commissions.

				Yup. They do make a shitload on comissions and even say themselves that some of that goes towards making the site better. So yeah.. would like to see that happen. I wonder if it&#039;s a personnel issue. After all, DPR can&#039;t exactly let anyone with a good resume and techincal background become the network engineer or database guy @ SR. I&#039;m not even sure if he has a proper &quot;team&quot; or if he&#039;s essentially a 1 man show with a few anonymous volunteers (who have no real access to the nuts &amp; bolts of the servers.). No clue really. All I know is that it&#039;s slow as fuck.<br />

LOL. <br />Man people are fucking crazy talking about DPR stealing bitcoins and vanishing. Any guy that keeps us posted (as he does) while he&#039;s WORKING 12 STRAIGHT HOURS THROUGH THE NIGHT to get this place back up so we can all enjoy our drug marketplace is not a thief.. he&#039;s fucking awesome and so is this place. Technology has it&#039;s limits and as I said in the other thread, which RxKing also just said.. you can&#039;t put up an ad on Craigslist for hiring system admins and network engineers. More then likely DPR is doing the lions share of the work HIMSELF due to the nature of who he is and what this place is. We should respect that and be grateful. Imagine life before SR.. it definetly wasn&#039;t as fucking cool. Enough whining and accusations and DPR is a human, he might get annoyed one day and just pull the plug. Let&#039;s try our best to keep it from happening.
