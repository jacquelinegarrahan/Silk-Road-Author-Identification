				I really don&#039;t think there&#039;s a huge effort to take down the site. As the article says, we&#039;re $20 million in a $300 billion drug market. Why would they waste their time? I mean a place like the Farmer&#039;s Market was easy pickings, but this place would require a lot money that needs to be spent elsewhere what with the country facing budget problems. I think we&#039;re safe for quite a while.

It&#039;s pretty much my philosophy. Why the hell does LE want to waste time trying to shut down one of the only (relatively) safe black markets out there? It&#039;s not like the people on here are just gonna clean up their habits if SR ever went down, they&#039;d go elsewhere that could possibly put themselves or others in the way of physical harm. <br /><br />I think the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is bullshit because there is only a war because the government wants to control these substances. If they were openly available (as they are on here), then violent crimes will go down. The less the government tries to squeeze the drug market, the less likely criminal activity will get sprinkled into my recreational activities. <br /><br />It makes sense to me anyway...

Im very curious / concerned about your statement if true. When you say $2K of servers and &quot;easily&quot; i need a bit more details on that... do you mean $2K worth of hardware not including someone with the brains to do the work? or do u mean someone would do it for $2K? what kind of hardware are we talking about here anyways? $2k wont even get you a high end desktop let alone a powerful server (unless you&#039;re buying used and heavily discounted servers) and define &quot;easily&quot; please. If it was easy how would SR have been up for so long then? Why hasnt anyone brought down SR or deanonymized it if it was so easy? I might be wrong but wouldnt a group like Anonymous and Lulzsec try to deanon SR if it was that easy?&nbsp; To say that the FBI doesnt have resources capable i think is underestimating their intelligence in an unsafe way. To assume they dont have some very qualified and skilled IT folks cannot be true. This is the FB-frickin-I we&#039;re talking about here. A never ending purse of money is as their disposal in the name of Justice. Do you not think that with a pocket as deep as they have that they couldnt afford to bring a small team of elite hackers onboard for less than a million dollars a year? that would be giving these people insane salaries which would be a huge incentive to de-anonymize SR properly and quickly. Even a million dollars for a few people is pocket change for the FBI if SR became big enough - i would say that the size SR is right now is enough to warrant them spending pocket change of a million to pay some of the smartest people. Unless you are strongly opposed to working for the government - ie an extreme hard care anarchist, who is also a computer genius and mastermind - then id say most IT folk would jump at the chance to work for the FBI and have that on their resume. And even the anarchists may suck it up to get on the inside of the FBI anyways. <br /><br />Anywho im starting to ramble like Jackie is known to do. Im a chatty kathy im sorry! My last bit i have to say is Shannon have you managed to deanon SR? And when you say deanon, what specifically do you mean by that? Like getting the actual REAL external IP address of the SR server? Are you able to get info on the type of equipment its running on, the OS, other software versions, whether they are physical or virtual servers? intel or non intel? im so curious about this. im not asking u to reveal this publicly (although PM me if you care to share) but just the general info on what u can or almost can deanon. <br /><br />BTW Shannon i want to clarify that Im not trying to be bitchy or catty. I re-read this and realized it could come across that way. Im intrigued and actually very curious about the claims you&#039;ve made because if you actually know how to deanon SR or any hidden service for that matter then you are one hell of a gal (or guy) and I have major respect for you, especially since having the power to deanon but not actually doing it for the good of the community deserves +8.7 million karma. hehehehehe.

Finally, a last possible intervention strategy is actually not to intervene. Politically, this is<br />a questionable proposition, as it may sound as an admission of weakness. There are however studies that<br />show that drug abuse prevention is considerably more cost-efﬁcient than enforcing drug prohibition [9].<br />The relatively rapidly expanding business of online anonymous markets such as Silk Road and the logistic<br />difﬁculties in shutting down such markets may further tilt t he economic balance toward prevention and<br />cure. As a result, laissez-faire, however untenable it might currently appear from a policy standpoint, might<br />become even more attractive in light of budget constraints. Although there is no public statement about it,<br />this could be the strategy currently adopted by law enforcement, seeing that the marketplace has not met any<br />signiﬁcant disruption to its operations, other than transi ent technical issues, in the past nine months, while<br />at the same time sales volumes have doubled.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Just a thought. I remember a while ago when Anonymous said they where doing an operation to bring down a load of Tor websites that where hosting child pornography, the SR website was down for a good few hiours and Anonymous came out with a statement didnt they basically saying sorry to the users of Silk Road for the interruptions but basically they where testing out if they could bring down the site. While the site itself was not taken down forever they where able to disable it for sometime, although that is completley different to finding the source of the website and its relavent owner right?<br /><br />Does anyone remember this happening, it was a post on the forums after the downtime, or am I just completley tripping about a dream I had&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

This only works if the hidden service is on a system that is directly connected to the internet. It could be used to detect the last internet facing IP that routes to the hidden service. It would also make it hard on a site like SR because of the background traffic, spotting the patterns they are talking about require a lot of known items and precision.<br /><br />So, Where it fails is if the hidden service is on a private network that is tunneled, VPN&#039;ed, or nated to the internet. So, for example, if I get a full service VPS from one of the anon services in a country that protects ones privacy and then create a VPN between a private network and that VPS using a nat address, this attack could determine the internet facing address but not the actual location of the hidden service. <br /><br />You could further confuse them by the fact that a single VPS could nat to 10&#039;s, 100&#039;s, or even 1000&#039;s of hidden services all with the same internet facing address but located all around the world.<br />

If the US feds wanted to take this place down, you wouldn&#039;t be reading this right now. Either they are biding their time while their plan comes together, or there hasn&#039;t been a major effort to target the site itself. The FBI/Secret Service/ICE/DHS absolutely has the talent to find a tor hidden service, let alone trace btc transactions. They have all the money in the world to hire experts and develop tools for such an effort. Locating the hidden service doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they&#039;ll catch the operators though. I think that&#039;s the impasse that they&#039;re stuck at ATM. Otherwise, why are all those supposed CP sites still open? I know they made a press release about it, but I wouldn&#039;t buy it. There is definitely something going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />That said, there&#039;s a good chance that no one wants to bother with SR. John Q. Public isn&#039;t putting significant pressure on politicians to close this place. You&#039;ll hear a senator, congressman, or some other dumbass politician mention it once in a while, but that&#039;s about it. The usual constellation of dying children, scary news reports, and local news stories has yet to be seen. Without said pressure, there just may not be enough of a push for LE to do much other than bust low hanging fruit and pool their intel. This isn&#039;t exactly TFM where they were using western union and encryption provided by a 3rd party known for cooperating with investigators. It will still require a great deal of effort to find the server and then track the operators down, and they have to consider the possibility that a new Silk Road will just pop up in its place. Perhaps they are working on a way to catch lots of random buyers instead, that way the whole mail-order-drugs-over-the-internet-thing moves back underground. Who knows? Your best defense is to take this threat seriously and set up a good defense. Not only will you not be a tempting target, but should you fall under investigation, there&#039;s a good chance you can avoid a conviction anyway.

I remember a while ago when Anonymous said they where doing an operation to bring down a load of Tor websites that where hosting child pornography, the SR website was down for a good few hiours and Anonymous came out with a statement didnt they basically saying sorry to the users of Silk Road for the interruptions but basically they where testing out if they could bring down the site. While the site itself was not taken down forever they where able to disable it for sometime, although that is completley different to finding the source of the website and its relavent owner right?<br /><br />Does anyone remember this happening, it was a post on the forums after the downtime, or am I just completley tripping about a dream I had&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Shit yeah I remember it was down for a bit a long time ago relevant to the reason of what you said.&nbsp; I was scurred.

				Anonymous rarely &quot;hacks&quot; anything in the traditional sense. They basically &quot;get in through the side channels&quot; rather than attacking the systems head on trying to find undiscovered vulnerabilities. I can only recall one prominent example of mainstream Anon actually discovering one, and that would be Goatse Security&#039;s hacking (more like mining) of AT&amp;T&#039;s iPad email database. Sorry, DDoS tools and social engineering aren&#039;t going to help bring down or trace a hidden service.<br /><br />The CP hack was pulled off by convincing some pervert forum that torbutton needed an urgent update. They then linked their own compromised version of torbutton rather than the official one, unmasking anyone who installed it. I think they took down a few sites and a forum or two, but these were old sites that ran outdated, horribly insecure software. Let&#039;s hope SR has better security than that, haha.

				It seems like someone is writing a new article about SR everyday now.&nbsp; Just now I found one from a French news site, I tried translating it and got this (the translation is obviously not perfect, so if anyone speaks french I&#039;m posting that version also):<br /><br />http://www.20minutes.fr/web/983513-site-underground-silk-road-ventes-drogue-explosent<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Silk Road et ses acteurs peuvent-ils échapper aux autorités encore longtemps? Suite aux articles de Gawker et de Wired, l&#039;an dernier, des sénateurs américains se sont alarmés et penchés sur la question. Récemment, le DEA, l&#039;agence américaines anti-drogue, a ouvert une enquête et cherche à identifier les administrateurs du site, qui, selon l&#039;étude, auraient touché 1,9 million de dollars sur un an grâce aux commissions prélevées sur chaque transaction. <br />&nbsp;<br />L&#039;administrateur principal, connu sous le pseudo Dread Pirate Roberts, a fait profil bas ces derniers mois, relançant les rumeurs sur une possible arrestation. Mais fin juillet, il a annoncé le lancement d&#039;une nouvelle formule du site. Sur le forum, certains rappellent toutefois que le pirate Sabu, d&#039;Anonymous, faisait semblant d&#039;être actif alors qu&#039;il collaborait avec les autorités après s&#039;être fait pincer.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What I could translate:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can Silk Road and its actors escape from the authorities still long?
