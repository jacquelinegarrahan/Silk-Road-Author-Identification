				I&#039;ve only been around this community for a couple months but back in Oct. the price per BTC was around $10.65 USD.&nbsp; Today it&#039;s $13.65 USD. Has it ever gone this high, or is this normal fluctuation? I think much higher prices will start driving people away.<br /><br />On a related note, this guy is saying he has made $100K investing in BTC; what do you guys think about this?<br />Clearnet link:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=116937.0;all

				I love it.. i have been stacking btc since I learned about them... I first got in at under 10 bucks each.. have accumulated more along the way and all in all I&#039;m up all kinds..<br /><br />I cant wait to see it at 20$.. that&#039;s when I&#039;ll unload a tonne.. also the bitcoin was at 40$ before... so it has potential to go back... mind you it was once at 4 cents each....<br /><br />

				This is because the bitcoin reached a certain amount in circulation so the number of coins being produced has been cut in half, probably will continue to grow

				As someone who has approximately zero interest in BTC price speculation as some kind of investment, the BTC price means nothing as long as I exchange GBP for BTC and place my order asap. Keeps it fairly simple. Sure, I could get more value if I put in the effort, but this is purely recreational for me.

				I must be missing something gathering from the posts above on BTC conversion rate from QC_M39_KING and Limetless. I was under the impression that higher USD to BTC (or GBP, AUD, etc.) meant less BTC can be bought at that rate, meaning yes that would definitely put off&nbsp; buyers from getting BTC until it came down a little. So while the ACTUAL value of drugs has not changed, it will still technically cost more to buy at this rate if you still need to buy BTC. What am I missing here? <br /><br />The high rate is the whole reason I&#039;m sitting here drinking Coke instead of sniffing coke (and playing with my poisons). Am I really bad at maths or something?<br /><br /><br />

				Oh got yah. TY for that breakdown. Thought I knew a LITTLE bit about computer tech, but since discovering the underweb last month I&#039;m finding the more I learn the less I knew. (Trying to read pine&#039;s posts is like reading Chinese.)<br /><br />Yeah explaining it that way does make a bit more sense. Yeah I do have &quot;cash to fuck around with&quot; but was earning reasonable INT on a term deposit. Then they got greedy and reduced it and I took it out. If I can&#039;t make money off them, they&#039;re not making money off me. Been watching AUD to USD climb a little, fall a little, climb a little, fall a little, but I need it to be at least 1.08 and sell at most 0.98 to make decent profit, ASSUMING there is no commission. I took a briefcase of money to my capital city and every bank or exchange union I went to wanted a commission for every 2,500 and on top of that wanted to know how much was in the case. Like I&#039;m that stupid to do either. I considered gold bullion but rate too high to buy (good to sell though). So now nobody gets my money, they&#039;re too greedy. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried talking to people in real life (SR is cyber life) but they haven&#039;t even heard of a bitcoin, let alone mining or the best place to do it. I set up an account with Mt.Gox as they have the lowest commission, but they actually wanted ACCURATE information about me. Weren&#039;t they hacked recently? I saw the customer DB for sale on the black-market with my own two eyes. So basically, you need to download an electronic wallet from a REPUTABLE site (done), wait days for it to synchronize and then keep synchronizing on a daily basis (done), then pick an exchange like Mt.Gox or directly P2P from an un-vouched for vendor, have a quick check on an independent site to see that the exchange rate is what they say it is, enter the amount to be traded, go to a non-local bank so you can give them false information about your identity when asked for name and number when making the exchange, ask them to write down the Order ID or whatever in the description section on the receipt they give you, take a photograph of this, upload it to the exchange market you chose to do business with, wait a few hours and hope it went through, assuming all this was done within 4 hours. If it wasn&#039;t, depending on who you used you will get the current rate or you will need to start the whole process over. Did I mention one numb-nuts exchange charges 10% for this service (Mt.Gox is about 1 I think)? And that you need to make a purchase as soon as you get it to reduce the chance of it being hacked like is happening to a lot of people? Oooooohh shit, that is so not uncomplicated or involved. <br /><br />Now. Bitcoin mining. Thiiiiink I&#039;m going to have to leave this to the pros till I get out of my BTC nappies. Good idea, yes. But some of us have still yet to make a single exchange thanks to how easy this process is. And investing in bitcoins? GREAT idea. IF you know what you&#039;re doing. I&#039;m still very much a newb at this. By the time I figure it out it&#039;ll be Christmas.<br /><br />TY for reply. Piece out. Don&#039;t forget to eat. Trolls, don&#039;t forget to die.
