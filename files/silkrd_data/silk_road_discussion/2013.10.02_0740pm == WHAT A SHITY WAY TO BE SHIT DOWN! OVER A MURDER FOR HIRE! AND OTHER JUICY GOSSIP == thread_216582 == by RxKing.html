				Even Hollywood could not write this.<br />We lost our site because our leader watched to many movies and was to big a nerd to not realize that every single time you do a murder for hire you get busted! I mean every week and week after week is dateline with this exact same story.<br /><br /><br />And what took SR down is DPR wanting to kill a rat. <br />The saddest part is they could have just policed the site and removed any post the guy made if he in fact had information. <br />&#039;<br /><br />Also it will come out that LIMITLESS was LAW Enforcement. Look when he left!<br />Also that Sugar Mama was actually the FBI set up to gather information on the countless vendors that used them to cash out.<br /><br /><br />I wonder how many members of the PGP club will quit? Or will they stay a club?<br /><br /><br />It is very sad to know that Silk Road as we knew it is over for good. I loved this place and did well.<br /><br />I wil mis a lot of people. Even Pine and Astor. They proved to be class guys! Yes PINE IS A MAN :)&nbsp; And in the end we agred to disagre about pgp.<br /><br />But what I wil mis most is the crazies! the ones would could not figure out that RxKing is made up! it is like Ric Flair. It iwas all marketing to sel pils. I had so much fun pising so few of with being arogant and talking shit. It was a blast. But I must say that I played fair. I never once used another name in the forums. And I never atacked another vendor. Though I had other venors that did not even sel what I did.but they were mad because I was aragaunt. LOL. I wil mis them. The fact they created many a name in the forums just to try and fuck with the King is unreal. <br /><br />But thank you to everyone. It was a fun ride! Cant wait for the next one! Also for any of my customers.Just mesage me here and i wil give you detailes of how to make purchases. As I do onot wan to break the rules and sel out of the forums 8)<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t even believe this shit if it weren&#039;t for the fact all my friends are nerds and they would do some shit just like this. Hope the next one to go mainstream doesn&#039;t make the same mistakes.

				Yeah, I&#039;m sure the majority of it is fabricated bs but it still wouldn&#039;t shock me if he did make the decision to go through with it...Not to mention all the shit we don&#039;t know, like how many DPR&#039;s there really are.&nbsp; The whole redandwhite story seems to be feds just doing work to justify NSA spying on him (no proof pure speculation) and it lead to much more. Fuck if I know but I&#039;m sure time willl tell.
