				Hmmm...<br /><br />Why is it called &quot;Black Market Reloaded&quot;? Has there been a site called &quot;Black Market&quot; before the current one? I have a vague idea that that is the case...<br /><br />No idea about a time frame, though.

				Silk Road is always going to be known as the OG in the anonymous marketplace world.<br /><br />I have always wondered how Silk Road started...As in how did SR market itself.? Did it start off with like 1-2 vendors and then just word of mouth? Or was it marketed in deep web forums? Can anyone share some insight as I have always been quite curious...
