				Interesting, It seemed as if I could do a bank deposit to bitcoin address but the Cash deposit company looked different and every amount said that my chosen amount was the limit and it wouldn&#039;t work.<br /><br />Hmm so choose Walmart to bitcoin address for that method?

				@danconia, thanks for clearing up what I was going to post when I read the thread title.<br /><br />The safest and most anonymous way to get BTC is to purchase them for cash from a vendor on SR.&nbsp; The BTC market on SR is complex, so be sure to do plentiful research before going this route.<br /><br />I do use BitInstant, and do my cash deposits at WalMarts.&nbsp; WalMart is good because, more often than not (well, every single time I&#039;ve done it), the customer service rep doesn&#039;t give a shit, and will input whatever you tell them to.&nbsp; Personally, I am able to plan well enough in advance to know when I&#039;ll be dropping &gt; $500, so that I can split up my deposits over a few days, and among a few different WalMart locations.&nbsp; (Only once have I had to run to 3 WalMarts in one night, so I could have enough BTC in my SR wallet in time to buy some quick-selling LSD, and it was really scary because those coins weren&#039;t tumbled for more than 2 hours--never again will I take a risk like that).<br /><br />My point is--if this is a problem for you &quot;today&quot;, then that sucks.&nbsp; Otherwise, now you know that it&#039;s $500 a pop, so you can plan accordingly, which really isn&#039;t a big deal.&nbsp; <br /><br />The most important thing is to plan your BTC purchases, so you have enough time to tumble them.&nbsp; If your issue is that you need &gt;$500 today to make a purchase, then your problem isn&#039;t the question of &quot;how&quot; to get the BTC, it&#039;s a question of &quot;can the BTC I&#039;m purchasing link me to the illegal items I&#039;m buying.&quot;
