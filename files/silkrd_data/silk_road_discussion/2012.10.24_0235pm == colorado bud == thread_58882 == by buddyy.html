				from me :)<br /><br />I get blueberry that sells at dispensaries as top shelf. It is the best weed I have ever smoked.<br />Colorado bud is the best in the world imo.<br />Fun fact: Denver was the first city to make weed legal.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/a3fa7f50ab

				Dank is dank whether it&#039;s from Cali, Colorado, Canada, the Dam whatever.&nbsp; It&#039;s all in the eye of the beholder, I could go on and on and say Co has the best buds ever but why the fuck would anyone believe me over their own tastes?&nbsp; Sample the strains around and don&#039;t worry about where it comes from, great growers live everywhere in this world.<br /><br />The one thing you need to worry about is how much you want and how often.&nbsp; Some vendors have a constant supply, others offer up things here and there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen lots of dank on this site and it comes from all 4 corners of the damn planet.&nbsp; Just find the vendor that has what you want in the quantities you want, and that just takes some looking around and trying things out.<br /><br />If you want to save some dough and still get an idea of what&#039;s available check out Uniwiz&#039;s thread on MJ reviews.&nbsp; It&#039;s at 90 pages of research already done for you (it&#039;s even formatted).&nbsp; It gives you an idea of what&#039;s out there and from who but it&#039;s still up to you to find what you like from a vendor you can deal with.<br /><br />The link is in a sticky at the top of the &#039;Rumor Mill&#039; (be sure to read the first post):<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10062.0<br />
