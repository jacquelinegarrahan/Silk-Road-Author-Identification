				you think starservice seems like a pretty legit seller to be safe using FE with, I mean he only does it b/c of the amount of scams he&#039;s been getting. So, I fully understand why he does this with new sellers. On another thread I made, it seemed like EVERYONE was so worried about using FE. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be fine, but if all doesn&#039;t go well, I guess I just won&#039;t be able to FE anymore.

				I don&#039;t understand how FE is a scam man. It seems as if starservice does that to prevent late payments or too many auto finalizing. I guess if I get scammed though it&#039;s only me to blame, and it does seem as if starservice has been around only for a month, but the reviews are all really good man, shipping seems legit, product seems legit. I don&#039;t know how anything could possibly go wrong. I specifically pinpointed a seller that had mostly all good reviews to do my purchase with. <br /><br /><br />we&#039;ll just have to wait and see. It seemed as if the product went unlisted right when I purchased it, so I hope my order doesn&#039;t some how get forgotten or w/e. I&#039;m hoping it did that b/c I was the last one to be able to get my hands on it...

Let&#039;s see...you could release your funds to the vendor and your package could never arrive. It may be a slim chance, but if something goes wrong you won&#039;t have any course of action to get your money back. I had the same issue as you, so I just looked around for vendors who were willing to work with me.

				The fact is:&nbsp; there are a TON of things that could go wrong.&nbsp; When you FE, the money is given to the vendor.&nbsp; The vendor doesn&#039;t have to leave his computer, before the money is his.&nbsp; Then the vendor doesn&#039;t have to DO ANYTHING once the money is his.&nbsp; He definitely doesn&#039;t need to send you your product!&nbsp; Many vendors do this by asking some buyers to FE, but not all buyers.&nbsp; Then out of the buyers who FE, *some* of them never receive a package.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a buyer, the ONLY! course of action for a guaranteed successful transaction is:<br />1. Buyer places order, goes to Processing.&nbsp; At this point, the seller is made aware of your order.&nbsp; Your order is added to their list.<br /><br />2. The vendor gets to your order, and they prepare the package, print the address label, and actually ship the parcel.&nbsp; Once the parcel is shipped, the vendor logs back on and marks your order as In Transit.&nbsp; Your address information given to the vendor is permanently deleted from the SR servers at this time.<br /><br />3. The order is moving through the postal system at this point.&nbsp; If you order from another country, it will take longer to arrive because items crossing international borders is a big deal, and they put alot of scrutiny in mail coming from other countries.&nbsp; This takes time.&nbsp; If the seller gives a timeframe, wait at least 20% longer than the maximum time in the timeframe before contacting the vendor.&nbsp; They are busy and usually don&#039;t know as tracking is unreliable and not secure.&nbsp; Or wait 17 days and extend the auto-finalize time in the resolution center.<br /><br />4. Buyer receives order.&nbsp; At this point, the vendor still does not have the money, so it is the buyers responsibility to inspect the product, and Finalize ASAP.&nbsp; Once you finalize, the money is put in the vendors wallet, so the transaction is completed.<br /><br />5. Buyer leaves feedback.&nbsp; Should be a 5/5 since this is demonstrating a successful transaction ;-)<br /><br /><br />If you follow that process, every transaction will be a pleasure.&nbsp; I have a ton of transactions, and I only got burned on my 4th order, and haven&#039;t since.&nbsp; DO NOT FE!!!!!!!!!!!!

You should worry about FE: it puts ALL the risk of the transaction on you, the buyer. Great deal for the seller, bad deal for you, don&#039;t FE. There are plenty of sellers here that are reasonable and just want to know you&#039;re going to be honest. Message them before you buy something letting them know you&#039;re new but that you&#039;re honest...oftentimes that&#039;s all it takes!

				Just going to throw this into the mix.<br /><br />I am a vendor on SR and today asked someone to FE because they had 0/0 stats. I told the buyer that he would need to FE prior to me shipping due to his minimal feedback. I also explained that should our first transaction go smoothly then for future orders he would not need to FE with me, even if others require 10 transactions before they stop asking newbies to FE.<br /><br />On the&nbsp; flip side, I FE&#039;d on my first few transactions as a buyer, the vendor doesn&#039;t want to take a risk and end up scammed so it is reasonable, however there should be some guidelines as to when you Fe instead of saying never. I don&#039;t expect SR to ever suggest it but as a real guide for new users this is when you should be finalizing early:<br /><br />For your first few transactions, probably your first 5. I mean real transactions not lottery or digital goods.<br /><br />After that just don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />Almost as important is who to FE with. Choose good, well recommended, established buyers. They have more to gain from a new repeat customer than they do from a one off scam.<br /><br />What to purchase? Whatever your poison is buy small amounts, 1g of weed, 0.5 of coke, 2 pills etc, that way the loss is minimal and probably isn&#039;t worth scamming you for.<br /><br />Finally once you have good stats you really dont need to FE again. However if you had the most amazing stats in the world and you wanted to order quantities larger than I have listed then you are going to have to FE or cancel the deal.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t freak out. If he doesn&#039;t mark your order in transit within 4 days from purchase I believe you will get your money back automatically. Even if he does you don&#039;t need to actually click &#039;finalize&#039;. You can then ask him to cancel the order because you hadn&#039;t been educated on FE yet.<br /><br />I sell to 0/0 buyers with no FE requirement. If they want to scam me by saying it never arrived then I have a tracking number. If the package didn&#039;t get delivered I will send again (or refund) with no hesitation. If it did arrive then you are wasting your time because I am going to win the claim.<br /><br />I would probably require FE if you have an auto finalize rate. It is not cool to have to wait 2 weeks to get paid for something you hustled to get delivered in less then 2 days.

I recently ordered something with starservice myself (who apparently doesn&#039;t have a presence on the forums, which is a big shame) and won&#039;t FE unless he requests it by message: I always feel more confident in FEing small amounts (&lt; 50 USD), particularly with a vendor that has a 100 rating. In the end, it&#039;s all about minimizing risks: if you see a vendor requests FE, make sure their record is air-tight. <br /><br />I can see why people get nervous too: when a vendor says they ship all orders within 24 hours (without specifying if that&#039;s everyday or just M-F) and it&#039;s been 2-3 days that&#039;s frustrating.
