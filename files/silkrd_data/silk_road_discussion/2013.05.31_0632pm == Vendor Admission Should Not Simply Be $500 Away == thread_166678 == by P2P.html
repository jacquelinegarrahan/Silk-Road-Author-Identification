				This is not a complaint or a request to increase vendor admission to some ridiculously high number (I already believe it is way too high. 150 was fine, in my opinion), but it is a wake-up call to all vendors out there. This is mostly addressed at the newcomers who are planning on being vendors, as well as any currently operating vendors who think they have everything under control just because they are successfully operating, presently. I am not a preacher, nor do I feel any sort of superiority over any member of this board, vendor or not. I do, however, feel a sense of obligation as a member of this board (long before most here today), to hopefully stop a new vendor (or future vendor) from destroying himself. I&#039;m sure most don&#039;t care, and would rather see the ignorant behind bars, but I do not believe this is conducive to our furtherance as a community and as a marketplace. There will always be new individuals coming in every day; a lot of them will decide to be vendors. Eventually, all the vendors currently here will retire and will be replaced by a batch of newer, less-experienced ones (it&#039;s already happened a few times over the course of Silkroad&#039;s very brief existence). <br /><br />We need to make sure these individuals are top-notch in their abilities to provide for the road. Therefore, I would ask that we implement a written test for all vendors, explaining their motives, what their prices will be, how they plan to obtain/manufacture, package, ship, launder money, carry out customer service, maintain the security of buyers, and maintain their own security technologically and otherwise. After a formal review by the administration, it would be decided whether or not the individual in question is prepared to vend on SR. Not only would this guarantee the competence of a capable vendor and remove the possibility of an inexperienced individual donning the vendor name, but it would also prevent scams as well. In addition, this would all be information that the vendor SHOULD provide on their front page anyway, so after all is said and done it would be a simple copy+paste job. You&#039;d get the vendor started with a solid page full of information of how they plan to best serve the road, and you would confirm their legitimacy as a competent distributor. <br /><br />I believe if we do not implement such a system, or a modified/similar version, SR itself will be directly contributing to the downfall of these individuals (and therefore putting its members at risk) by doing nothing about their ignorance. The fact that any fool can log on and immediately start vending just because they have $500 in their hand does not reflect the silkroad community&#039;s diligent attitude toward security. These individuals could have no idea how to package, how to ship anonymously, how to launder their money so as to avoid prosecution (and therefore seizure of data that could lead back to SR buyers), how to provide themselves with technological security so as to remain anonymous, they could be dealing excessively in their own local markets, and the list goes on. A vendor like this could even end up with positive feedback in certain cases, provided the packaging is not terrible and the shipping time is good. But these individuals, behind the scenes, could have no idea what they&#039;re doing in several of the many facets of what is required to be a competent vendor. This is evidenced by questions certain vendors will ask around the forums. And this is not to say a vendor asking questions is a negative thing, but if they are asking questions that directly apply to basic vending skills (while they are actively vending), this is definitely a problem.<br /><br />An SR vendor needs to be one of the most trusted and competent individuals we have, because we literally have to trust them with our freedom. Any individual who cannot be trusted absolutely with this responsibility, should not be a vendor. And those who can be need to have their competence confirmed through testing or other similar means.

				I understand what you are saying and I am going to remain neutral on the subject but I would like to say that it would be a horrible idea for a vendor to provide how they are going to obtain/manufacture, package, ship and launder money on their vendor profile for the world, including law enforcement, to see.&nbsp; I also believe that a $500 bond is far too small but that is just my opinion.

				But don&#039;t we want more vendors on here? That means more competition. Competition should help to lower prices and improve the quality of service you get from a vendor.<br /><br />If you keep the barriers low, of course some bad vendors are going to get in sometimes, but they should get weeded out of the market by bad reviews or not having the right price.<br /><br />Maybe if the requirements to get the bond back were tougher, it would encourage better vending, but I don&#039;t think that really solves any problems.

Okay and now take my idea into consideration that only DPR should be trusted with the vendors business plan and not have to have it posted on the main page. <br /><br />DPR could read the potential vendors business plan and decide if they seem legit, but not post it on their page (unless they want to) for the entire world to see.

				This wasn&#039;t meant to be a proposal, per say, but rather a call to action on the part of the administration. Any details that need refining could be ironed out, but I do think this would weed out any vendors BEFORE they ever would get a chance to touch the market. Yes, the market can do that itself over time. However, the amount of time is not always constant. Certain vendors can last a very long time doing the WRONG things, i.e. vendors who cash out to bank accounts in their name with no justified income or to prepaid cards with their name and SSN on them, or those that ship RC&#039;s that a drug dog would not pick up on and therefore don&#039;t bother to use foil or MBBs, or those that use kiosk-printed postage and are unaware their picture is being snapped by USPS every time they print. Vendors NEED to be aware of these kinds of things - everything, really - before they ever even think about starting a vendor account. Why allow them to destroy themselves just because of ignorance? Educate them; and if they don&#039;t want to be educated, don&#039;t give them any responsibilities to screw up. This plan is mainly to prevent vendors from destroying themselves and others, before they do something stupid at the start of their vending career. A lot of vendors rush in and start selling due to the enticing nature of the quick profits that can be made, and they don&#039;t take the time to take care all of the research that needs to be done. Then, they make mistakes. THEN they start to learn. But those mistakes can be in the form of electronic records that will never go away, and the vendor will always be vulnerable. The idea here is to prepare these men and women for what they are going to be facing - basic training, if you will, before going on the front lines where the consequences of ignorance is the loss of one&#039;s most basic freedoms, and imprisonment.

				Just my 2 cents- giving one person (DPR) the knowledge of a few hundred people&#039;s criminal activities makes them a bigger liability. That would mean that DPR has approved all sales activity thru his site - right now its automated for a reason. DPR owns a website and its anonymous and doesn&#039;t control the content, posts or what is sold. Putting the liability in his hands is probably one legal aspect he doesn&#039;t want to take - and I as a vendor would feel greatly vulnerable knowing one person had this much information (power).

Not only would this guarantee the competence of a capable vendor and remove the possibility of an inexperienced individual donning the vendor name, but it would also prevent scams as well. In addition, this would all be information that the vendor SHOULD provide on their front page anyway, so after all is said and done it would be a simple copy+paste job. You&#039;d get the vendor started with a solid page full of information of how they plan to best serve the road, and you would confirm their legitimacy as a competent distributor. <br /><br />I believe if we do not implement such a system, or a modified/similar version, SR itself will be directly contributing to the downfall of these individuals (and therefore putting its members at risk) by doing nothing about their ignorance. The fact that any fool can log on and immediately start vending just because they have $500 in their hand does not reflect the silkroad community&#039;s diligent attitude toward security. These individuals could have no idea how to package, how to ship anonymously, how to launder their money so as to avoid prosecution (and therefore seizure of data that could lead back to SR buyers), how to provide themselves with technological security so as to remain anonymous, they could be dealing excessively in their own local markets, and the list goes on. A vendor like this could even end up with positive feedback in certain cases, provided the packaging is not terrible and the shipping time is good. But these individuals, behind the scenes, could have no idea what they&#039;re doing in several of the many facets of what is required to be a competent vendor. This is evidenced by questions certain vendors will ask around the forums. And this is not to say a vendor asking questions is a negative thing, but if they are asking questions that directly apply to basic vending skills (while they are actively vending), this is definitely a problem.<br /><br />An SR vendor needs to be one of the most trusted and competent individuals we have, because we literally have to trust them with our freedom. Any individual who cannot be trusted absolutely with this responsibility, should not be a vendor. And those who can be need to have their competence confirmed through testing or other similar means.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This will never happen. Trust me. This will never happen in a million years. It would prove administratively impossible to process that kind of information, and even if it were possible, financially it would be suicide. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I&#039;m very new to the road but was hoping to slowly make my way to vending (I think I estimated a 6 month time line to allow for proper learning, set up, and to start removing myself from F2F operations) So please excuse me if I don&#039;t grasp something fully, in fact please enlighten me.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of buyer protection, buyer power and control. I realize the buyers need protection from scams, and dangerous activities that could result in jail time. However there is an inherent risk in doing this activity. Just like going to the street corner you could be robbed or busted. In fact I think its more likely to happen in F2F situations. <br />There also seems to be very little protection for vendors (at least I can&#039;t see much). I understand that once a vendor slips a package into the mail that it is unlikely they are going to be caught for that. That if they are cautious on the web and with their bitcoins it is also unlikely they are going to get busted. But this doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t face real problems and aren&#039;t in danger.<br /><br />I also am uncertain of the process to become a vendor, it&#039;s to far away for me to look at it in detail as currently there is an immense amount of information for me to try to learn. But I have seen that it requires 1500 bond (returned after x number of sales).&nbsp; They are also vulnerable to scamming and to threats of poor feedback. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I would like to detail an operation to &quot;strangers&quot; so I&#039;m not sure how a test would work, or who would grade it.<br />I do think there should be a newbie vendor forum (in the newbie forum there is a lot of help but there is also a lot of spam/missed questions) I would hope that the newbie vendor forum would act as an introduction of what to expect, what is expected and as much &quot;how to&quot; info as could possibly be laid out without compromising method and security. That being said, anytime a LE decides to order from a vendor they learn the vendors method. So methods to stealth are most likely not as secret as everyone hopes. <br /><br />You state that you would ask what a persons motives are. I don&#039;t want to sound rude but the answer to this is either is going to be one of the following: a lie, money, or $^%# off it&#039;s my business. More importantly what does it matter what a persons motives are? If they are a scammer they are not going to state &quot;to scam the community&quot; if they are in it for the money they are going to say so, and I imagine that there is pretty much no one falling into the altruistic category just trying to spread free love. <br />I would also point out that if you make the requirements so stringent on vendors the road itself may fade away. if there are only 5 sellers of apples here and I was one of them I would quickly and quite openly say to the other 4 sellers &quot;hey, there is no competition if we all price set. Gas companies do it. so lets agree on a price point and simply track each others pricing.&quot; <br />Another possibility is that they price rise as a result of harder entry requirements. If I have to do more work and prove myself then why should my time there after be worth more (this is similar to 2 people doing the same job but one having a university education. The one with post secondary will start at higher pay usually and have a higher salary cap)<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I believe that the vendor system and those entering into it can be improved ( my post on what I would like to consider doing IF i was to become a vendor http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164656 )<br /><br />You also speak about the problem of them vending locally. I imagine that if the road provides enough income it is unlikely they will vend locally. However I also believe that in this free society and free market it is almost hypocritical to start claiming that there is a limit to how much a person can vend locally. Again don&#039;t misunderstand I fully agree with your point, it is crystal clear what the risks would be and why they would grow. But again IF I decided to make the plunge to become a vendor after doing as much as possible to learn the various systems involved in being successful here, who has the right to tell me that I can or can&#039;t vend locally. The risks are mine to take, the rewards are mine to reap. Aside from that there is also no way to police this, and I don&#039;t think any vendor wishes to admit anything about themselves. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a vendor yet and perhaps never will be depending on how much I can learn and how much of an investment is required and for what return. But I feel bad for some of the vendors on here. I know it&#039;s a loose system that allows for scamming (but it&#039;s scamming from both sides). There seems to be a big emphasis on vendors being shady. Perhaps this has developed over time as vendors have been shady. I don&#039;t know the history. <br /><br />It&#039;s also hard to receive answers as a vendor. Do remember it&#039;s a business and despite the community feel every other vendor is a competitor. The only reason for vendors to care slightly about any other vendor is if a vendor puts the SR itself at risk. I don&#039;t know if that is even possible? Is this system so fragile that one poorly educated vendor doing it wrong and getting busted would result in the whole system being shut down? So with that in mind I do hope for help and one day I hope to help others but there is a bottom line and competition will hurt &quot;mine&quot;. So how much/detailed any help is, is questionable. A vendor may even consider giving bad information to prevent competition. You do recall that most people on the vending side have most likely come from a world of scams, shady people, violence, lies, and theft. It&#039;s a hard world that makes hard people capable of dehumanizing a person and reducing them to a balance sheet. You ever see a crack dealer catch up with someone that owes money and has been ducking? you ever seen a green team strip a grow ? These are violent actions. If you are capable of doing what is required to stay in the game, then you are more than capable of providing false info to a would be competitor. In fact in the real world you can fight over territory, this misinformation may be the same &quot;fight&quot; for territory. So where does a person like me find real and good information to provide service on the road?<br /><br />this is long and bloated but I really do want to learn and I do view a lot of these things as issues. If you can point me to more information I will gladly read it (and please not another &quot;so you want to be a vendor&quot; thread. They are very informative BUT after reading more than a few it gets repetitive and fails to answer some key questions.)<br /><br /><br /><br />

Please do not misconstrue this as a self-righteous buyer with his blinders on to the vendors, as so many are. I do not think we are oppressed by vendors, or that vendors form an oligarchy with DPR at the head, pulling the strings, setting prices, selectively scamming buyers left and right, etc. What I would say to this is that there is a lot about the author of the OP you do not know, so please do not make assumptions.<br /><br />Another thing about this: I don&#039;t know if you read my posts, but this was designed with VENDOR safety in mind, even more so than buyer safety.&nbsp; It&#039;s fairly obvious this may do little for the buyer, but could prove absolutely invaluable to the vendor by saving their life. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166678.msg1185847#msg1185847">Quote from: bluegreen23 on June 01, 2013, 02:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t think I would like to detail an operation to &quot;strangers&quot; so I&#039;m not sure how a test would work, or who would grade it.<br />I do think there should be a newbie vendor forum (in the newbie forum there is a lot of help but there is also a lot of spam/missed questions) I would hope that the newbie vendor forum would act as an introduction of what to expect, what is expected and as much &quot;how to&quot; info as could possibly be laid out without compromising method and security.

If you operate on a private site, such as his (just as a shop that operates on private real-estate), you are subject to his executive decisions and rules. Without him, there is neither a vendor, nor the money that comes with being a vendor, nor a SilkRoad. He and his associates are clearly competent enough to oversee a review of vendors for the site that they created. Not to mention the information you would provide would be nothing that you could not already reveal publicly. I don&#039;t know why detailing how you plan to ship, what you are selling, a vague overview of your laundering procedure, your hours of operation, whether or not you sell locally, etc. would make you a target. I gave a very brief, vague overview of how the &quot;test&quot; (if you&#039;d like to call it that) would work. Basically a written description of how one plans to operate - I believe someone else described it as a &quot;business plan,&quot; and I would think this to be a more accurate description than a &quot;test.&quot; Like I said, this is not a proposal but a persuasive document that can hopefully lead to a more specific discussion and proposal on a pre-vending review procedure.<br /><br />I agree that a newbie vendor forum would be beneficial. However, all the information is here on the board, it&#039;s just not centralized in one place (which I beleive to be a good thing). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166678.msg1185847#msg1185847">Quote from: bluegreen23 on June 01, 2013, 02:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You state that you would ask what a persons motives are.

If the potential for profit is there, vendors will always come to take a piece. Just because something is a bit more difficult to do does not mean that no one will do it. You need only look to the professional world. And most of these vendors are getting paid at least twice what those individuals make. We need professionalism and quality service here on SR. Just as I wouldn&#039;t want someone that didn&#039;t pass high school operating surgery on me, I do not want incompetent vendors on the road, for two reasons (as I have mentioned). 1. They are bound to destroy themselves and ruin their own lives (this is what I am most concerned about. Any convicted felon knows what I am talking about). 2. They may drag buyers down with them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166678.msg1185847#msg1185847">Quote from: bluegreen23 on June 01, 2013, 02:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Another possibility is that they price rise as a result of harder entry requirements.

However, I think this is a weak argument (maybe a side thought you just wanted to throw in, I have no way of knowing). Having to prove your competence before being vendor will not raise prices, especially with the currently established market in place. Like I said, this would be most of the work a vendor would have to do anyway to set up their home page/listings. Why not do it in the form of a presentation to prove competency? I don&#039;t see what&#039;s wrong with it. Maybe you view vendor&#039;s haivng to study for six months to &quot;pass&quot; (like I said, it&#039;s not a test. Answers would be entirely subjective) like an MCAT/LSAT/GMAT standardized test. You may as well have just finished school, eh? No. That&#039;s not what this would be, at all.

In this case, you are wrong. Vendors have frequently gone outside the confines of SR to do their selling and it has usually resulted in problems. No one has the right to make you do anything, but it will be said to vendors who plan on vending locally that it is highly unadvisable to vend outside of SR and will put a very short timer on your career, guaranteed. Like I said, this is about informing the vendor.

It could get very messy very fast. My policy is security before everything, especially money which will cloud one&#039;s judgment very easily. With proper training and knowledge of general procedures, a vendor should never even have to have any sort of encounter with LE, ever. The road does not need the attention, and the buyers do not need to be put at even more risk than they already are.

				Really? The vendors are the ones taking the greater risk. Asking them to take even MORE of one by submitting a business plan (esp one that includes descriptions of how they plan to launder their profits) makes you sound either like LE or laughably removed from the reality of criminal enterprise- in which case you might want to reconsider what you&#039;re doing here. Besides, it makes no sense. Any vendor who agreed to such stipulations I&#039;d avoid like the plague, as they&#039;d obviously lack any sense of security. <br /><br />Besides, what&#039;s wrong with Darwinism?&nbsp; It&#039;s worked so far. <br />

				I wanted to say thank you for answering my in such detail and for your original post. Though I still disagree with some of the ideas (or at least how they might be implemented) I do understand where you are coming from. Though I think perhaps I worded some of my thoughts and questions a little poorly to not express what I specifically meant, and you are correct some thoughts were merely side tracked and added in, I appreciate the time you took.

The vendors are the ones taking the greater risk. Asking them to take even MORE of one by submitting a business plan (esp one that includes descriptions of how they plan to launder their profits) makes you sound either like LE or laughably removed from the reality of criminal enterprise- in which case you might want to reconsider what you&#039;re doing here. Besides, it makes no sense. Any vendor who agreed to such stipulations I&#039;d avoid like the plague, as they&#039;d obviously lack any sense of security. <br /><br />Besides, what&#039;s wrong with Darwinism?&nbsp; It&#039;s worked so far.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Both of those initial assumptions are incorrect. Transaction to transaction, vendors are not taking a greater risk. However, by being uneducated or inexperienced in the vending process, they are taking a huge risk. The fact that very few individuals on the Silkroad seem to have any interest in the welfare of their fellow human beings here actually attests to the fact that THEY are in fact too far removed from any sort of criminal enterprise to sympathize. If you had ever been in a situation where you were facing hard time in prison (maybe some of you have, but I would assume most of you have not), you would understand how serious a matter this is, and how by simply educating people it can be avoided.<br /><br />And as for the free market argument I keep hearing: The idea is this - DPR is at the top. He has already passed down executive decisions banning the sales of firearms, CP (I am making a point with this one, please no baseless accusations), counterfeit currency, or anything that could harm another human being. Therefore, this market is not 100% free. There is a head that can regulate it. That is already in place, and the people are fine with it. YOU are fine with it, as far as I can tell. He acts as the highest overseer of the market as we speak, and all of his decisions are final. Not a presidency, not a constitutional monarchy - a dictatorship, albeit a benevolent one. So let&#039;s take a step down off our high moral chariots and speak about reality, for a minute, if you will indulge me. <br /><br />The fact is that it is simply irresponsible and, quite frankly, tacitly malicious to allow incompetent individuals to become vendors. It is the same in all walks of life. I do not know why someone should get a free pass to jump right in just because they chose to distribute illicit substances. It&#039;s insane to have no prerequisites in this business, especially when you are talking about a business that controls what you think it is that you are putting into your body. I understand the position of some is, &quot;Well, then let them start up. Even if they fail, who cares, right?&quot; But we&#039;re not talking about CPAs or lawyers or someone working at starbucks here. We&#039;re talking about individuals involved in numerous ongoing criminal activities, who may or may not have any idea what they are doing.<br /><br />I do not doubt the ability of the free market to weed out these incompetent vendors - that was not at all the subject of this discussion, and I completely agree with you on that point. What I am talking about is protecting vendors from themselves by educating them before they do something foolish, and having a way of evaluating whether or not they are prepared to vend in a safe and efficient manner. <br /><br />And for the third time, I am not handing down a mandate of what this method would be. I am simply asking that serious steps be taken to propose an evaluation method that would both benefit the vendor and the Silkroad by preparing the vendor for vending and by ensuring the Silkroad that the vendor is prepared. I do not see anything wrong with this, in theory. However, I am seeing people coming in here to pick apart the individual parts of my completely hypothetical, brief, and vague description of what a method would be like. This is a pointless exercise. Look at the merit of the idea as a whole, and think how you would practically implement it. It is a practical suggestion, can be implemented within the rules of the Silkroad, and would save several vendors from the serious repercussions of ignorance in this very unforgiving business.

				Vendors may not be taking a greater risk at the moment they are sending something. There is very little risk in dropping a package in a box.<br /><br />However vendors take outside risks, theft, violence, scam, and are far easier to target for legal action. To be fair they are most likely the intended target for investigation and prosecution. There are risks to everyone involved but the buyer is receiving (generally) a personal amount that doesn&#039;t offer a great bust for LE. <br />I would argue that on terms of risk the vendor takes far larger risks than any buyer.<br />Depending on amount, I don&#039;t know if a person without prior convictions, purchasing a personal amount would actually face any hard time. I doubt a judge would give someone months of jail for a gram of anything. <br /><br />As stated before I&#039;m new here and I mean no disrespect but you assume what you believe to be someones intent (DPR or anyone else).&nbsp; From my stand point it might be a simple risk analysis. Perhaps fire arms and CP would create to much negative publicity, or be higher on a priority list than small amounts of drugs. Your definition of &quot;not selling anything that could harm another human&quot; seems some what lacking. Counterfeit money seems to be fairly harmless (on scale of things that cause damage to a person) where as meth seems to be fairly destructive. To be blunt most to all drugs sold here are more than likely some how dangerous and detrimental to a persons health and well being. All I&#039;m trying to point out is your assumptions about the intent of someone else may not be correct. <br /><br />I believe the market determines who is a vendor and who isn&#039;t. It is a simple system. The better the vendor the better the feedback the better the reputation the more sales the more reviews (upward spiral). The opposite is also true. Negative feedback results in fewer sales, fewer reviews (except for the previous negative) and eventually they are out of business. There may be casualties along the way. That is unfortunate. But there are casualties on all sides of this business. To limit this use a trusted vendor. Just as as a vendor is unlikely to make large sales to a new buyer.<br /><br />If someone has no idea what they are doing it is likely that they will fail on several fronts. But buyer beware is also a part of this. I get the impression you are trying to almost stream line and idiot proof purchasing. I hate to say this but if &quot;you&quot; (not actually you) want to be a buyer on here then &quot;you&quot; need to do your research as well. Not only how to receive and safety measures on and off line but also to research each vendor that you wish to purchase from. To be horribly blunt. If a buyer is to lazy to spend 10-30 minutes reading up on a vendor, policies, practices, reviews and what not then that buyer is exactly the same as what you are claiming of some vendors. <br /><br />Everyone needs to take personal responsibility for themselves.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t research a vendor and you get scammed it is most likely a risk that you chose to take. I have doubts that any long time reputable vendors are out there just randomly scamming people. Yes I recognize that it is possible, but I think unlikely. At any rate I think this comes down to mostly personal responsibility. Vendor need to be responsible in their learning and research. Buyers need to do the same. Purchase responsibly.<br /><br />That&#039;s my 2 cents anyways.

				Yes it should, in fact it should be more. Firstly, it&#039;s not an &#039;admission&#039; it&#039;s a &#039;bond&#039; once you have achieved 30 transactions, $1500 worth of sales, have been a vendor for six + weeks, and have proved yourself to be an asset to this community (not a scammer) than you can apply for your bond to be refunded, so in actual fact once you&#039;ve proved yourself your vendor membership is free. If you wish to read up on this you can do so via the SilkRoad wiki dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide#Bond I am in full support of the $500 vendor bond, it weeds out scammers, and it&#039;s a pittance compared to what the average vendor earns here.

				Respectfully, vendors are taking a bigger risk transaction to transaction. Their feedback, offerings, etc are visible for anyone who signed up to SR to see. You can get a good sense how much business a vendor is doing from their feedback which puts a great liability on the vendor. Vendors can&#039;t actually see a buyer&#039;s transaction history until they purchase that vendor&#039;s product so they are much more protected. And even then its only visible to that vendor- not the entire SR community. Not to mention vendor reviews on this forum which are helpful to buyers but also place much more liability on the vendor if 200 people are saying they are a great vendor and what sort of quantity they bought. <br />

				The OP is reasonable enough, but I completely disagree and it&#039;d be bad for the Road.<br /><br />Simple reason:<br /><br />The more vendors, the more products, the more competition, the lower the prices. True? True.<br /><br />Now, certain types of buyers are willing to take chances with new or untested vendors; they&#039;re doing us a service. Others only feel safe ordering from the big dogs on the Road. As the buyers who don&#039;t mind risk buy from a new vendor, especially if the noob starts with low prices to draw business, the more risky buyers will soon find out if the vendor is legit or not, and if the vendor is great, then they eventually become a big dog and it&#039;s a win-win-win. But if that same potential vendor was scared off or just didn&#039;t want to deal with testing, or was put off by the fee, then that&#039;s a potential loss for the community.<br /><br />Think of it this way... in human evolution, some were more prone to eat everything in sight that seemed edible. If they lived and didn&#039;t start convulsing, the people more concerned about safety then try the berries, and they weren&#039;t poisoned.<br />

				Its awful that some people come on SR with the intent to defraud the system and customers. However, rather than focusing on making the entry into SR more difficult by increasing the bond or implementing restrictive procedures - perhaps the focus should be on educating the buyers. No Finalizing Early on any vendor. Or no FE on any vendor that does not meet a certain criteria (50 transactions, $5k worth of product sold, etc). Protect the buyer without limiting vendor inclusion into the free marketplace of SR.<br /><br />

				fivestargirl and others, I don&#039;t know if you fully read this thread, but in the future it would be wise to do so since your comments have been addressed. A lot of you are completely missing the point. This is about protecting the vendors, and the buyers (but not as much). The vendors are what I was focusing on here. My argument about buyers taking more immediate direct risk stands, but that was a digression from the main point of the original post. Take CHROOTS comment about the buyers, and replace the word &quot;buyer&quot; with &quot;vendor.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166678.msg1188719#msg1188719">Quote from: CHROOT on June 01, 2013, 10:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Blaming the victim doesn&#039;t help to solve the problem. Not everyone is as sophisticated a buyer as you are, and not every buyer comes to the forums first. Fuck them, fool and their money right?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What everyone here is arguing is that competition will weed out bad vendors. For the second time (and this is the second time I have had to say &quot;for the Xth time&quot; by the way - please read the thread), I agree with you. I agree. Free market competition is great. The bad vendors will not prevail. They won&#039;t. They may make a bit of money, but they will not last and the market will always stabilize. I agree. Should I say I agree one more time? I&#039;m not going to, because I&#039;ve said it enough - in this post, and I believe one or two others on this same thread. <br /><br />Protecting buyers, though, is not as much of what I was talking about as protecting VENDORS. Vendors. Protecting vendors. I apologize if the redundancy seems condescending but I assume if I say the main concepts of the post three times in the same post (as opposed to three different posts), people may grasp what I am saying better. I am either a terrible linguist, or no one read all of what they should have to be able to respond accurately to this thread.<br /><br />So it&#039;s not that I am saying, &quot;Place restrictions on vendors because there are bad vendors that will hurt buyers.&quot; I am saying, &quot;Make sure (by whatever means you like) that the vendor is 100% competent before selling so they do not hurt themselves or others. Mainly, so they do not hurt themselves. And by &quot;hurt themselves&quot; I mean ruin their own lives simply due to ignorance.&quot; Everyone here seems to want to focus on the &quot;or others&quot; portion of my assertion when it only slightly pertains to the entire point. Yes, buyers get scammed. I am not suggesting a method to stop all buyers from getting scammed, because that will never happen. However, less scamming may be an indirect result of this method. I am suggesting that a vendor should be properly educated on the procedures that are required to be successful and secure here on the Silkroad before ever starting, because mistakes made at the start can last forever (in the world of computer databases that we live in today). I do not know why evaluating vendors for competency would be seen as an inappropriate step to take toward improving the Silkroad. Less busted vendors, less lives ruined, less buyers put at risk. <br /><br />I feel like I just have not made my position very clear, and therefore everyone is taking the argument in a completely different direction. I know for a fact none of you (who are not sadists) are against vendors educating themselves. All I am arguing is that there needs to be a system in place to confirm they are educated properly and therefore ready to sell to you, the buyers, without setting themselves up for a serious downfall. Yes, the free market will take care of you as the buyers if you are educated, I understand, but the vendors do not get this sort of security. They have to do everything themselves, from nothing. They don&#039;t pay a competent person to do everything for them as the buyers do. Therefore, it is very likely that they could slip up in one or more of the several areas over which mastery is required to be a successful vendor. Why not prevent this? I&#039;ve displayed my arguments covering how this would help the road, but what are the arguments against it? So far I have only seen misdirected arguments that are not specifically aimed at what I said, but rather a misunderstanding of what I said, or those that have just said &quot;I disagree&quot; (likely under the same pretense). So hopefully this clears up my position on this matter for most of you and we can actually rationally discuss things instead of being on two very different pages.<br /><br />P.S. A $5000 bond would, I believe, deter most nefarious activities, but it would not at all mean the vendor was well educated and it could actually deter otherwise competent people from starting vendor accounts simply due to it being too much of a financial reach.

				This (general) idea could be discussed in much more detail and a ton of variations could be discussed (before potentially putting any of them into action) <br /><br />For example<br /><br />An initial vendor account could be kept at $500usd and but their &#039;SR tax&quot; is higher than higher rated vendors, therefore the harder you work and better your rating the lower you will pay eventually. <br /><br />The best vendors should be rewarded with less payment(s) and the noobs should have to earn their low taxes by gaining better ratings. <br /><br /><br />

				My .02btc<br /><br />I believe that the sentiment here is earnest. That the feeling is truly one of protecting the community. But it seems to me that this is the same kind of reasoning that has led to the host of bureaucratic nonsense that plagues business IRL.&nbsp; At some point &quot;Protecting Vendors&quot; and &quot;Protecting Buyers&quot; becomes &quot;Protecting the Privileged Incumbents&quot;. Are we at that point right now? No. But the point is it&#039;s a very slippery slope past this point. <br /><br />$500 is a lot to someone just starting out selling. But it&#039;s arguably an obtainable hurdle. <br /><br />$5000 can feel like a lifetime away.<br /><br />And I think that while it COULD scare away some of the riffraff. The more likely scenario would be that it would scare away, hardworking, entrepreneurs, who just want to find a stable customer base outside of the street. You could order 1 Kilo of Research Chemicals from china for $1000 pay your $500 vendor bond and be up and running servicing a need on this community. <br /><br />If you had to pay more. You might simply walk away. And that sucks.<br /><br />And the worst part is, a higher bar to entry wouldn&#039;t stop the scamming. It would just make the scams of higher caliber and ultimately more damaging to the community. People would falsely feel more secure that people had a higher bar to entry.<br /><br />Regulated industry in America has to pay a shit load to get started. And no ones ever heard of an American Company scamming anyone, right?<br /><br />But what do I know.<br />

The vendors are the ones taking the greater risk. Asking them to take even MORE of one by submitting a business plan (esp one that includes descriptions of how they plan to launder their profits) makes you sound either like LE or laughably removed from the reality of criminal enterprise- in which case you might want to reconsider what you&#039;re doing here. Besides, it makes no sense. Any vendor who agreed to such stipulations I&#039;d avoid like the plague, as they&#039;d obviously lack any sense of security. <br /><br />Besides, what&#039;s wrong with Darwinism?&nbsp; It&#039;s worked so far.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Both of those initial assumptions are incorrect. Transaction to transaction, vendors are not taking a greater risk. However, by being uneducated or inexperienced in the vending process, they are taking a huge risk. The fact that very few individuals on the Silkroad seem to have any interest in the welfare of their fellow human beings here actually attests to the fact that THEY are in fact too far removed from any sort of criminal enterprise to sympathize. If you had ever been in a situation where you were facing hard time in prison (maybe some of you have, but I would assume most of you have not), you would understand how serious a matter this is, and how by simply educating people it can be avoided.<br /><br />And as for the free market argument I keep hearing: The idea is this - DPR is at the top. He has already passed down executive decisions banning the sales of firearms, CP (I am making a point with this one, please no baseless accusations), counterfeit currency, or anything that could harm another human being. Therefore, this market is not 100% free. There is a head that can regulate it. That is already in place, and the people are fine with it. YOU are fine with it, as far as I can tell. He acts as the highest overseer of the market as we speak, and all of his decisions are final. Not a presidency, not a constitutional monarchy - a dictatorship, albeit a benevolent one. So let&#039;s take a step down off our high moral chariots and speak about reality, for a minute, if you will indulge me. <br /><br />The fact is that it is simply irresponsible and, quite frankly, tacitly malicious to allow incompetent individuals to become vendors. It is the same in all walks of life. I do not know why someone should get a free pass to jump right in just because they chose to distribute illicit substances. It&#039;s insane to have no prerequisites in this business, especially when you are talking about a business that controls what you think it is that you are putting into your body. I understand the position of some is, &quot;Well, then let them start up. Even if they fail, who cares, right?&quot; But we&#039;re not talking about CPAs or lawyers or someone working at starbucks here. We&#039;re talking about individuals involved in numerous ongoing criminal activities, who may or may not have any idea what they are doing.<br /><br />I do not doubt the ability of the free market to weed out these incompetent vendors - that was not at all the subject of this discussion, and I completely agree with you on that point. What I am talking about is protecting vendors from themselves by educating them before they do something foolish, and having a way of evaluating whether or not they are prepared to vend in a safe and efficient manner. <br /><br />And for the third time, I am not handing down a mandate of what this method would be. I am simply asking that serious steps be taken to propose an evaluation method that would both benefit the vendor and the Silkroad by preparing the vendor for vending and by ensuring the Silkroad that the vendor is prepared. I do not see anything wrong with this, in theory. However, I am seeing people coming in here to pick apart the individual parts of my completely hypothetical, brief, and vague description of what a method would be like. This is a pointless exercise. Look at the merit of the idea as a whole, and think how you would practically implement it. It is a practical suggestion, can be implemented within the rules of the Silkroad, and would save several vendors from the serious repercussions of ignorance in this very unforgiving business.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>As far as the free market goes, you could probably tell from the tone of my first post that I agree with you: no market can be 100% free, particularly one owned and curated by a private individual.&nbsp; There are already a number of rules in place, chief among these is the mandated use of bitcoins as currency on the site. Still, I think the idea is to run the site with as little regulation as possible, and vetting vendors for competence in the way you suggest seems like it would be alien to everything SR stands for. The whole point of an online marketplace is to provide a space for people to buy and sell. Its like pirate bay,you don&#039;t expect the owners of TPB to vet every torrent and it would be impractical for them to try.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why anyone would want to protect vendors from their own incompetence? If someone chooses to avail themselves of the high profits available in the illegal drug business (profits which are high due to the very risks involved) then they should be responsible for the risks themselves. Why should I expend time and money (restricting entry to SR for vendors would increase prices, definitely!) insuring them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor vendors cannot incriminate anyone but themselves. That&#039;s the beauty of SR. And as far as how other vendors should react, there&#039;s an old joke:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two men are hunting when they are attacked by a hungry bear. One stops to tie his laces. His friend says<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you doing you can&#039;t outrun a bear?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He replies<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#039;t need to outrun a bear, I just need to outrun you!&quot;

				yeah $500 is pretty low..<br />Plus a vendor can just give themselves 30 fake transactions.. obviously it will cost them a little bit, but not much if they just buy the initial $1500 worth... <br /><br />The bond refund thing is automated so its not gonna have a clue anyone is giving fake feedback.<br /><br />On some new vendors its retarded.. They have been a vendor for 1 day and on the feedback they already have like 2 of 3 people who sumhow managed to receive the items... on the same day the vendor started.. <br /><br />and the &quot;F.E for trusted vendor&quot; when the vendor has like 6 transactions is absolutely retarded... like some of the vendors, it really makes you wonder.

				Although I commend you on your effort to improve the quality of vendors on SR I also think it would be stupid if I was a vendor to hand over they key to my castle so to speak. One thing that I do believe should be implemented that all new Vendors should samples to a Quality Assurance Team designated by SR or by the general public of SR forums. Like maybe long time Forum members who have contributed alot. This way we can assure that the product they plan on selling is authentic and good. I&#039;ve seen too many times people falling for fake products that are so obvious. One example of this would be &#039;greendaddy&#039; selling fake pills from India. It&#039;s so obvious to me from the pictures that they&#039;re fake. However I&#039;m pretty good at finding and researching stuff on the internet. Some people see a good deal, a new vendor and just have faith in them. That&#039;s probably the only thin I would like to see implemented into the current Vendor requirements. This would ensure that only authentic and quality products are sold on SR.

				IMO a new vendor must pass a PGP test showing that they know how to use it before getting a vendor account.

After all it&#039;s your safety if you&#039;re risking your freedom by not using PGP. I put off using it for so long cause I kept seeing so many posts with ppl having trouble with it. Took me about a whole 15mins to learn it after reading a very good tutorial by Pine.

				I believe that people in this game don&#039;t just jump into being a vendor without thorough consideration of their own well being, I just don&#039;t see it.&nbsp; There are tons and tons of &quot;street&quot; dealers and I believe that the ones without common sense stay there.&nbsp; Just to get to SR takes a little time to figure out.&nbsp; Then you have to figure out BTC.&nbsp; Then you have to figure out PGP.&nbsp; Then you have to figure out how to ship a package.&nbsp; Then you have to figure out time management. Then you have to figure out the bond.&nbsp; Then you have to figure out how to please anonymous people.&nbsp; Then you have to figure out how to repeat.&nbsp; Then, and only then do we get to figure out if you are worth it and possess integrity and do what you type that you will do.&nbsp; Competition is the only ability to control prices, without competition there would be extreme price gouging, which I believe already goes on pretty ramped!!&nbsp; Yes other sites are cheaper but there is nothing like the Road and never will be!

				I wish it was back to 150. 500 is pretty steep.<br /><br />Besides, the protections are in place if a vendor gets in for free or pays 5000 dollars. It changes nothing.&nbsp; Don&#039;t finalize early. Get your product, inspect it, then finalize. How the hell could you get scammed that way?<br /><br />SR needs an update in design to be more user friendly. There should be lots and lots of warnings about FE...
