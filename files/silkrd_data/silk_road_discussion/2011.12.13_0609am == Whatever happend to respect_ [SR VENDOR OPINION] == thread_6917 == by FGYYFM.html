				I am posting this publicly because I believe everyone should participate in the discussion.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been selling on SR for about six months now. I&#039;ve seen a lot of drama, but throughout all of it there was still a modicum of respect for buyers. I treat my customers the way I would want to be treated,and yet I see many vendors (not going to name names, because I respect most of my peers) acting as if they are superior to their buyers (even if that may be true.)<br /><br />Does this sound familiar? &quot;Treat your customers with respect. Go above and beyond for them. &quot;<br /><br />Customers don&#039;t owe us anything but money. We owe them many things. We owe them at the bare minimum honesty about our wares, deletion of identifying information after shipment which is something that I know many of us do not do, and prompt service.<br /><br />It starts there, but doesn&#039;t end at that. There&#039;s always &#039;salesmanship&#039; in this business--but as of late it has become quite ridiculous. Whatever happened to &quot;Describe your items accurately and truthfully.&quot;<br /><br />And it keeps going. The protections set in place for buyers are continuously eroding. Many vendors are beginning to work exclusively outside of escrow (I am guilty of this for some types of orders.) This is a bad idea for several reasons:<br /><br />1.) We are putting all of the risk on our customers--from having their personal information to having them take on the entirety of the monetary risk.<br /><br />2.) By pushing for transactions outside of escrow we are opening the doors for fraudulent vendors to easily take advantage of our customers--OUR CUSTOMERS. ******<br /><br />3.) While it&#039;s true that we&#039;re never gonna run out of customers on this site, we are fostering a lower quality customer base. If we continue to put an undue burden on our customers, the reliable ones may begin to move on.<br /><br />Basically, whatever happened to &quot;Treat your customers with respect. Go above and beyond for them. &quot;<br /><br />These are only parts of a larger problem. SR is dis-functional. I don&#039;t know how to fix it, but something needs to be done.<br /><br />Sorry if it&#039;s written poorly. English is not my first language.

				Hmmm. Some upset people posting tonight.<br /><br />I can speak primarily as a buyer, I am looking for a supply to fulfill my demand. It mostly works here on the SR. Sometimes things don&#039;t work out exactly the way I want them to. <br /><br />Bad things happen in real life too. So...<br /><br />Everyone needs to mitigate their risk, balance the risk vs reward, and throw the dice. <br /><br />SR has worked for me. Continues to work for me. <br /><br />Just trying to counterbalance a bit here. <br /><br />Oh, hey, everyone keep in mind this is the holidays. People freak out during the holidays, and I think on SR that would be something like sellers need a little more money and might be leveraging to the hilt, and buyers are turning to chemicals to self treat depression or what the fuck ever, and are doing lame things, you fill in the blank.<br /><br />Everyone needs to relax. This is business. If something happens to you that personally annoys you or fucks with your money (as a buyer or seller), remind yourself that this is business and move on.<br /><br />Huh. Is that advice too vague to be useful? Someone help clarify my thoughts? <br /><br />cheers,

				This kind of post makes me proud to be a member of this community.<br />I am an anrcho-capitialist. A philosophy completely unknown by most and scoffed at as utopian by many who know some but not nearly enough about it.<br />Mostly, those aware of this position consider it heartless.<br /><br />Your post helps to outline that the honest, profit seeking businessman knows that in order for him to succeed his customers must remain happy to be contracting with him and to keep coming back willingly.<br /><br />Service is not what assbags like politicians and bleeding heart intellectuals&nbsp; try to brainwash young people into believing it is: serving the government/collective/whatever.<br />It is serving your customers well, one at a time.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Buyer only... I do understand seller frustrations when people scam them, and I can see why they would want new buyers to finalize early to reduce the risk there. Buyer feedback is a good idea in theory, but as has been mentioned it is so easy to make another account.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the solution. The simple fact is SR must work on mutual trust and respect, and there will always be scammers both buying and selling.

				I am (only) a 2 time buyer but I took the time to learn PGP, bitcoins, etc. and I followed the requests of the two highly rated sellers I dealt with - it all went really well.<br /><br />As a customer, treat your vendors the way you (and they) would like to be treated and as a vendor treat your customers well, too.<br /><br />Mutual respect and care is the only way this precarious enterprise (SR) will succeed and thrive. Unfortunately, SR is part of the real world and mutual respect of all kinds seems to be dwindling fast. It&#039;s a shame.

				I got screwed on my first order with CFMF. I had good faith and when he asked to finalize early, I as a new buyer went ahead and did as he requested. Communication went well. Then bam. He disappeared. <br /><br />I then did business with Tetravort and could not have asked for a better experience. As a buyer, I am looking for someone who is serious about their dealings. I work hard for my money, and no one enjoys being scammed. I want good, honest, and open communication. <br /><br />Agreed, for a successful transaction, choose vendors that have strong track records and always be cordial and respectful in all communications. NEVER, assume and ALWAYS give the vendor the benefit of the doubt. Be polite, and certainly you will be treated the same.<br /><br />

				I wonder how many transactions go off without a hitch - i&#039;m guessing the majority, or these forums would be over-run with complaints!<br /><br />As a somewhat new buyer, I have no complaints at all - used around 5 different sellers - and all of them were polite/friendly - and most importantly, got me what i ordered fast and discreet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t like the idea of going out of escrow either (the one time i almost did get screwed, not finalizing early saved all my coins) - but if sellers demand it....buyers have the right to choose a different seller.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think things are going really good overall on here - hope it continues into 2012!&nbsp; sure, sometimes shit gets weird...but it gets weird sometimes dealing with these kind of things in real life too

				I wish buyers would read the profile page. Geez. Take a little time to familiarize with each vendor and the ads and rules/procedures. It really makes things a lot easier and won&#039;t piss off the vendor w/repeat easy questions. Following the rules is respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;STAY WITHIN ESCROW!!! WITH FEW EU EXCEPTIONS!!

				I don&#039;t agree with forcing all new buyers to finalize early. For large or international orders I understand but small domestic orders can be done in escrow even with new buyers. <br /><br />Sellers must always use delivery confirmation on every shipment. Then if a scammer says they didn&#039;t get the package you can prove that the order was delivered. The buyer will likely get no refund from SR resolution and the only loss for the seller is time.

Many country has not DCN and other services and many users forget that SR gather seller from all around the world.<br />For seller without DCN there is no other way to ship some items and they require early finalize. They can publish prior purchase terms like 50:50 shared risk what seem to be fair to both party.<br />We should ban 0.00btc items for feedback - and payment outside SR system where SR does not have his share and deal is not evident.

				I agree that vendors should be respectful. But lets be honest and clear, there is no need for vendors to be respectful to their customers. If a vendor has fyre dope then they can be disrespectful as fuck and thier dope will still sell. This is the dope game it is unlike any other business. You can tell every1 who buys from you they are scum bag drug addicts then continue to say how much do you want? In most cases they will answer you with a dollar amount.<br /><br />SOME people who buy coke, heroin, meth, or crack arnt drug addicts. But a large enough portion of them are that vendors can tell them they are piece of shit drug addicts and still get plenty of business. I have seen this in real life. I admit in real life it plays out differently but ultimately the dope man has the power if YOU have the addiction. The goal of every dope man should be to get their customers hooked so their customers NEED them not WANT them. <br /><br />Being a dope man means you have power. Alot of dope men never had power before they got involved with dope. So it is a consistent and constant thing to see dope men abuse the fuck outta their power. But their power is so unique and so complete for some people that they can basically do what the fuck they want and get away with it.<br /><br />Dope men own Mexico and the Mexican army protects them. There are numerous criminals in Mexico that can tell the president fuck you because of the power that the dope gives them. Why do you think that some dope men on SR would be any different?

I joined shortly after you stopped shipping to my country (the US) and now I wish I had found out sooner so I could have tried your pseudo-legendary product. Do you think you&#039;ll ever start shipping to the US again?
