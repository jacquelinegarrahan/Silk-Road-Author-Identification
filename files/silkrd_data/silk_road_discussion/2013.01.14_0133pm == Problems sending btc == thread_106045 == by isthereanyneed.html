				It has been working fine for me. I did notice that it doesn&#039;t always allow you to send the full amount of BTC you have available. Try sending the amount, minus 0.01btc and it should work. ;)

				I had similar issues last week all I done was log out then sign back in then tried it again and it worked but before this it happened a couple of months back and this method did not work so its any ones guess sr can be temperamental , have you contacted sr support they should be able to help.

If you are trying to deposit 1.1 btc, try 1.09 btc as SR rounds off the bitcoins.<br />so technically you could have 1.09999 btc.

				Am having the same issue. Extremely annoying when I have customers waiting to receive their BTCs that they have paid for. Hoping it is fixed soon, or has anyone else found a fix for the issue?

				@Black<br /><br />That happened to me a couple of months ago it was impossible to send btc every time it just kept throwing me out then the white screen then I hit refresh then I would have to reconnect again and again. Since then I have found&nbsp; that if you try to send btc again as soon as it gives you the error message it makes it worse some how.<br />&nbsp;if I cant send btc now I wait let it be for a couple of hours then try again and its usually ok but then other times its impossible to send, luckily it has not happened for a while now.

				Sounds to me like they&#039;re being proactive as far as hack defenses go.&nbsp; They may have erred too far on the side of &quot;safety,&quot; or maybe it just isn&#039;t quite finished and working smoothly yet.&nbsp; Still, this may be a good thing and not a bad thing is all I&#039;m saying.<br /><br />Or it may mean the whole place is falling apart, lol... but I find that very unlikely.&nbsp; Just sayin&#039;.
