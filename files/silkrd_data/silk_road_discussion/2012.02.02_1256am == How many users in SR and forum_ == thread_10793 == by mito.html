That was originally my purpose - I created an account so I could see marketplace, was awestruck by the selection and prices, and started using it. <br /><br />Additionally, scammers / spammers - and considering that some vendors refuse new customers with a high user #, low-number buyer accounts might be worth something - to make you look like you were with SR from the beginning.

				I think it is safe to assume 10% are active. So 15,000 active seems like a better guess than 1,000 to me.
