No problems. Delivered in 2 days from payment.

He&#039;s got a story that&#039;s to good to be true.<br />Besides that, if you google his item list ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3650.msg32047#msg32047 ) you will find out<br />that 1 website in particular comes up . The prices match, the item name matches. Just copy / paste it to google and see for yourself.<br /><br />About the positive ratings about DD on this forum...as you can see from my username its very easy to create a newbie account and leave<br />a (few) positive post(s). So obviously this isn&#039;t proof of a succesfull transaction! <br /><br />Thanks to people like DD buyers loose their trust in other underground vendors who CAN be trusted.<br />DD also drags SR into this by saying he HAD a vendor account, but claiming it is not safe because of the press.<br />And DD claims to offer a 95% refund, but all you&#039;ll get is 100% loss of BTC and 120% BS! And empty handed off course.<br />Personally i think DarkDiamond is full of BS.<br /><br />It&#039;s really sad to see people like DD fuck it all up.<br /><br />Again...DD is a SCAMMER. You WILL get fucked if you do business with him...TRUST ME!<br /><br />Thumbs up to the TRUSTED vendors!<br /><br />P.S. DarkDiamond...if you read this...go fuck yourself! Stealing BTC causes cancer<br />

				Hi Nick the Geek, what an outburst! Especially from someone who has never ordered from us, What the hell are you saying?<br /><br />How, with all the positive comments over tor, not just from new users as you suggest can this be a scam?<br />Would we really take the time and effort for a few bitcoins, would it even make sense.<br /><br />How are people to trust you as you ask them too, when you offer no proof other that the shit your talking? <br /><br />I am reading this and I have indeed had cancer, it was not from stealing bitcoins though. <br /><br />If anyone has any questions or wants me to justify what I have said, or how I have treated the retard that posted here. Please contact us via email. We do not have time to regularly check each thread that mentions us<br /><br />Anyway, With that said.<br /><br />We now have a Tor Hidden Service Website Up &amp; Running where you can contact us, see our products etc. <br /><br />Its Here http://cs5nqmkzmq2flnq2.onion/index.html<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to bookmark<br /><br />--DD--
