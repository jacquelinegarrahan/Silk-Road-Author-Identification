				With these last few days being unable to access the Road I have been going out of my MIND! <br />Because Silk Road does not only supply drugs but in a big way it IS my drug. I&#039;m forever scouring the listings, checking out new psychedelics, looking for special deals and communicating with vendors to get to know them before a purchase. I also do a lot of watching the forums (though I haven&#039;t posted half as much as I should because I&#039;m a very involved buyer on this site). <br />But all in all it&#039;s an amazing place giving us back our freedoms to live our lives how we choose without the powers that be telling us we can&#039;t put this and that into our own bodies. This is how it should be and DPR is the fucking man (or woman) for treating us to this fantastic, safer alternative.<br />But like I said I&#039;ve found it really difficult to get on with these last few days because there is business that needs tending to on the Road and closure regarding purchases etc. I definitely need to communicate with a specific vendor when I get the chance and I&#039;m sure he&#039;s waiting to hear from me too.<br /><br />But with all these issues with the site (and not a word from DPR for a day or so) I&#039;ve ended up checking out two rival sites (if that&#039;s what you&#039;d call them) just in case it comes to that. Both Atlantis (with it&#039;s VERY suspicious name) and BMR.&nbsp; <br />Just by signing up to have a mooch about I feel like I cheated on my girl haha, I have no interest in those other sites AT ALL. Atlantis seems to suggest it&#039;s going to sink to the depths and take all it&#039;s inhabitants with it and BMR just has NO FLOW WHAT-SO-EVER. There are a couple of things that SR could take from BMR such as the live currency exchange rates and products shown in BTC, USD and GBP this I find very useful and is something I&#039;ve been hoping for ever since I joined SR but it&#039;s not exactly the issue of the week and it&#039;s not needed at this very minute but it is something I&#039;d like to see eventually.<br />I&#039;m guessing no-one is getting any further than the privoxy error page or whatever it is with your particular browser at the moment? <br />I haven&#039;t seen the login page for over two days now and it&#039;s rather frustrating I must admit. But I do have visions of DPR and all his/her little techie elves tapping away at keyboards and fighting some intruder in an epic battle. <br />I hope he/she can update us soon on where we&#039;re at and I hope this turn out to make the site EVEN more secure than it already is and lets pray for some faster service on SR. Not that it&#039;s a problem from a buyers point of view other than just frustrating when it has a fit, but it must be hell for vendors trying to take orders, read messages and respond between sourcing, packing and shipping.<br /><br />Either way it&#039;s really shite that SR is down right now and that it&#039;s been down as long as it has been and I just want to get back to business, but I also want it to be safe for us all so I&#039;m prepared to be patient with this one.<br /><br />My one and only problem with SR is (and it relates to the forum anyway) I received a negative karma point on one of my posts (I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a way to find out which one and I don&#039;t know who marks the karma) and I know for a fact I&#039;ve not posted anything that requires a negative anything, I&#039;m well spoken and fair to all. I didn&#039;t even bad mouth a vendor when he/she ripped me off with a FE (which I&#039;ll never do again) because they had already received so much verbal beating by the time I got to the forum I thought if I post anything I&#039;ll just be doing it for the sake of it instead of having any purpose, they&#039;d already vanished by then.<br />But yeah I don&#039;t understand why I got a negative karma point, shame really. Feels like being at school again when a teacher makes you feel like you did wrong when you know completely that you didn&#039;t.<br /><br />Anyway guys, let&#039;s hold strong with this one and keep our heads above water and soon we&#039;ll see land ahoy and we can once again walk the road to happiness.<br /><br />I have a lot of heart for everyone who uses this site and all admin. I hope this place remains strong and sturdy for a very, very long time.<br /><br />Peace

If the money ends up going towards the cause, I would support that.&nbsp; The reason for my personal belief in this site, is that I am convinced that psychedelics and other drugs are a catalyst for change and revolution. As for the others, I&#039;m with you on that, too.&nbsp; BMR is a halfway decent site, I like to think of it as SR&#039;s little brother.&nbsp; &nbsp;Atlantis however, is the name of a fucking casino in the bahamas, a sunken city, etc. yeah, it has historical reference in the greek tales.&nbsp; The problem with Atlantis is, boom there goes a DDoS, followed by a HUGE amount of advertising and promotion by them, on other sites.&nbsp; I&#039;ve checked out BMR, but I won&#039;t touch Atlantis with a 10ft pole, behind 100 proxys! <br />Fuck Vladamir! it is just bad shit to post on reddit, insulting DPR by spelling his pseudonym wrong, and not editing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I seriously believe that they hired internet mercs to do this for x amount of time to give atlantis a big boost.&nbsp; Thats why they didn&#039;t do it right after launch, they waited a bit, because they must have made enough BTC to hire a botnet and a couple hackers or whatever.&nbsp; They are cocky fuckers at Atlantic(what I&#039;m calling it now, because that is the ocean they will sleep in), if they think that we can&#039;t see through this bullshit.&nbsp; Truth be told, it is probably the same people that hit Mt.Gox, seeing as Atlandix started with Litecoin.&nbsp; The Litecoin connection also suggests that they are jealous types.&nbsp; Why? because the only reason people started using LTC over BTC is because of jealousy of the early adopters/creators of BTC, and their understanding that they can be the early ones, this time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to see Atlantis play fair, although there is some chance that LE is doing this as an intentional failed attempt at shutting down the site and busting everyone.&nbsp; This way, they can say &quot;we spent x and shut the site down for a bit, that is all.&quot;, but that seems unlikely, implausible, but not out of the question.&nbsp; Whoever is doing this will run out of money/time/space/support, and I would not want to be in their shoes when this comes back to them, in person.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We should have patience and fortitude, and justice will be served.&nbsp; Take this time to contemplate the fragility of all that is beautiful and righteous.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Guy T., SR user for 1 year. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				Choosing a name for a business or whatever is a very important thing, it symbolizes what you&#039;re business stands for. Silk Road refers back to the Chinese Silk Road where opium and other important trades travelled to different parts of the east, keeping a constant flow of goods. DPR chose well.<br />Atlantis sank into the abyss. It&#039;s the kind of name LE would call it. Simple. You can laugh all you like but A/ I&#039;d never take the risk and B/ I don&#039;t want to turn my back on SR. EVER.<br />As for contacting a vendor in advance, it depends, I certainly wouldn&#039;t call it rude especially as most vendors will say &quot;contact me if we haven&#039;t answered your questions here&quot;. Sometimes it&#039;s important for me to do so, I have questions before I do business with someone. No-one has told me to bugger off or been unimpressed with contact prior to ordering. The only person who didn&#039;t answer me was LucyDrop and after reading the avengers LSD review thread it turns out this vendor is is described as shit at communicating and causes nothing but hassle. Funnily enough, the lack of communication when a potential buy is on the cards is a good enough sign for me to walk away from that vendor and try elsewhere.<br />You may find yourself offended by a buyer contacting you before a purchase but that would be your choice to be offended, vendors I have communicated with have responded postively and been more than happy to help.<br />So no, I have no idea what you&#039;re talking about, no it&#039;s not rude to contact them before.<br />And it&#039;s not wasting their time, it&#039;s most times ONE message with a question or two and requires a single reply. People on here jump the gun too easily. I guess you&#039;re all withdrawing from your addictions!
