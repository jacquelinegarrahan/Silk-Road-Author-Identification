				Hey sr help and advice needed here....<br /><br />I have an order coming from O/S, it has been 16 days and the status of the purchase is just about to go into auto finalize I have messaged the vendor asking what can be done but he is very slow in replying to his messages and from what I can gather from the short and sweet messages he does send is that he will only give a 50% refund if you show him a letter from customs proving the seizure, well I&#039;m not sure what to do if something else happens&nbsp; asthere are lots of other things that could happen other than customs getting their hands on it, postal workers stealing it, it getting lost or held up for weeks etc etc.<br /><br />Should I make sure I get a refund or reship or do I have to take it all as one big loss and just accept it? This not a very good service from this vendor at this point I am keeping his identity a secret in case he does manage to come good, my buyer stats are very good no refund or auto finalize or canceled orders over 100btc spent in 3 months.<br /><br />I have messageed support yesterday all I can do is wait now I guess.

				Hi isthereanyneed whatever you do don&#039;t let it autofinalise or that will affect your stats even more and you will have no chance of any refund. You need to take this to resolution - this way you can come to an agreement with the seller:<br /><br />1. I suggest your first step be to extend the time for item to arrive e.g. by 5 days etc which is probably the best thing to do just now as items coming from overseas can take a while depending on where&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; it&#039;s come from and where it&#039;s going.<br />2. If item still doesn&#039;t arrive go for a refund or resend. Personally I prefer resend as getting a refund takes its toll on your stats :(&nbsp; This will depend on the vendors terms and conditions - as you say he offers 50% which is not a total loss!<br /><br />If the vendor you bought from has good feedback you probably don&#039;t have anything to worry about and your package should arrive. At least if you go to the resolution centre they will facilitate an agreement being reached by both of you and I&#039;m sure the vendor will respond to that!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

I mean the vendor will not issue a resend at this point I dont think as it could still come?<br /><br /><br />

				thanks for the karma itan :)<br /><br />I would wait until just before it autofinalises before going into &#039;resolve&#039; and yes you&#039;re right it&#039;s too early to expect refund/resend at this stage. I would imagine an extension of time will be the first step as your package is coming from overseas. SR support are also quite brief in their communications as well - but fair too I suppose as they see things from both sides.<br />&nbsp;<br />I once bought weed from a new SA vendor who was a total scammer - anyway it ended up he never even logged in again and by going through resolve SR I had to extend delivery by 7 days and then they gave me full refund which affected my stats real bad.<br /><br />Good luck :)

				oh shit I got muddled I actually only have 18 hours left till auto finalize!<br /><br />If it gets extended does this mean I still have to click resolve or do I have to click resolve in order to get the order extended ?<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Yup, click resolve and you arrive at a screen where you can either exted or go into resolution.<br />For O/s orders it is fair to extend for another 10 days.<br />

				Thanks for help people, <br /><br />I got a 7 day extension on the order and finally heard back from the vendor he sent me a template standard message which basically said when you click buy you accept my rules and my rules state that if the order does not arrive you will only get a 50&#039;% refund if you show me the letter from customs proving the seizure&#039;<br /><br />I am pissed off with his lack of effort in the communication dept, this order cost me $250 not a massive amount but still enough to feel the loss, if I cant get a reship and no refund is offered then&nbsp; I wont be doing business with this guy again, you know what something was telling me not to place the order before I did but I got to excited and just ordered it.<br /><br />Such a shame any tips on dealing with unreleasable over seas vendors would be greatly appreciated round about now :(<br /><br />

				Had over 30 transactions and some O/S and nothing like this has happened, this vendor seems fishy, if I think there is something not right I will let you all know his name but for now I&#039;m hoping he will do the decent thing I mean chances are I am going to get a letter from customs any time soon or hey it might still come but I doubt it, I have a feeling I&#039;ve been selectively scammed just by the shear lack of comms, I have been sending him big essays in my messages expressing my issues on the matter then all I get is a template message thanks for that bro makes me feel great!<br /><br />

				inyala said what I would say earlier than I got to say it.<br /><br />Whatever you do, do not let it autofinalize.<br /><br />I am speaking from experience, when receiving shipments from overseas you MUST monitor them manually, whether communicates is awesome, or ass, from the vendor.<br /><br />Your stats will thank you.
