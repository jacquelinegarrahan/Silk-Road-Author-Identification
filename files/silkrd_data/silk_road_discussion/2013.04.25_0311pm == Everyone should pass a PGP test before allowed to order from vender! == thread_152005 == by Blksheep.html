				I believe there should be some sort of test that is required to pass before someone is allowed to order from a vender. I had to learn, from lots of help of SR&#039;ers, and I just feel that a vender shouldn&#039;t have to go through all the mistakes newbies make. It cost them time, and time is money. I am not a vender, but I feel for you all that goes through it! I&#039;m still learning about things on SR, and some of you sternly correct me of my mistakes, as you should. But a vender shouldn&#039;t have to be bogged down with incompetence. Just my feelings on this subject.

				Personally, I always use encryption when sending sensitive information to vendors. That is a choice I make myself as it makes me feel safer. If people don&#039;t want to use it, or feel the risk isn&#039;t increased by not using it, that is their choice. SR is built on Libertarian principles (if I am not mistaken; correct me if I am), so in essence, people are free to choose whether or not they utilize encryption software or not.<br /><br />Each to their own though... :)

				You know what...your absolutely correct psychedelicmind in your feelings on this. I correct my &quot;USA Government&quot; view on this! lol I just felt that venders may get a little pissed off with having to deal with someone who doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing and screwing up orders. Also, I feel that encrypting sensitive info, like personal addresses, should be required to protect themselves from prying eyes. But as you said, this is solely the choice of the individual. Let freedom ring. lol

				Don&#039;t forget:<br /><br />if a vendor looses your address, and he asks for it again in a PM within silk road, dont forget to encrypt it all again.&nbsp; Not just on the order page. <br /><br />I made this mistake recently...&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems so casual too,&nbsp; you hand over the ship address instantly when a vendor asks for it again , not thinking about it much.<br /><br />I had no idea if the vendor account was phished, or if it was LE.&nbsp; Dumb.&nbsp; None of this wouldn&#039;t matter if I had just used PGP like I was suppose to - every time you correspond incriminating or personal info.<br /><br />Think before you click submit.

				Isn&#039;t the order note encrypted though? As in, only the vendor can view your address while the order is processing and once the vendor marks it &#039;in transit&#039; no one can see it.<br /><br />Cause if that&#039;s the case, it seems to me that sending your address by PGP in the order form only makes for a higher chance of user error, your address getting stored on the vendor&#039;s computer for example. Cause instead of just viewing it on SR and then marking it in transit, the vendor now has to decrypt it all, then view your address, now stored on his computer. To me that doesn&#039;t actually sound safer, but I may be wrong here. :p<br /><br />Definitely use PGP if you for any reason have to send incriminating information through messages though, and absolutely use PGP if contacting a vendor through tormail if SR is down.

Meritocracy!<br /><br />--<br /><br />If there were two changes I would make to SR, these are them:<br /><br />1. Vendors becoming PGP fluent should be mandatory. There could be a basic course on opSec and infoSec which they have to pass before they join. No restrictions on newbies, because they are cute newbies. Everybody is a fluffy newbie sometime. But vendors have to be held to higher standards. Alternatively you could not make it mandatory, but reduce the start-up fees for vendors who pass their opSec/infoSec exams. I&#039;m in favor of a relatively laissez faire system, allowing new vendors flexibility to learn the ropes with their first hundred orders, but at some point they need their &#039;driving license&#039; or they&#039;ll screw up at some point. <br /><br />The key problem with this is that it would also bias a vendor to keep one account instead of several smaller accounts, which I consider unfortunate, but am open to suggestions.<br /><br />2. Get rid of FE completely. I think it&#039;s advantages are outweighed by the disadvantages.<br /><br />That&#039;s it! Everything else is just a detail. Other infrastructure can be built around SR independently e.g. option derivatives to decrease volatility and so on. Better to keep such things independent.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Seriously. <br /><br />That&#039;s why vendors should be especially committed to it. If you are captured and the Feds open your SR account somehow, and they have nothing but encrypted messages, many of their strategies fall flat on their face. e.g. distinguishing between domestic and international as a means to pressure you.<br /><br />But even if only 10% of customers use PGP, that means something. If SR is taken offline, it is a whole lot easier to regroup when you have PGP aware customers. Not only are communication links intact if the customers used receivable email addresses, but you have the option to prove to them you&#039;re the same person by using signed PGP messaging, thus keeping your reputation intact. Finally, the PGP using customers are also likely to be your best customers, not just by weight, but by simply not being idiots and being consistent repeat business.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You also have idiots like me who have encrypted all sensitive information since day one and then decide one day to place an order without encryption....not so much decide as just go braindead for a minute. :/ It was with a major vendor who is a serious proponent of PGP, as well.&nbsp; Still waiting for my order and hoping to DPR that they don&#039;t decide to teach me a lesson. Trusting they won&#039;t though. Luckily, they don&#039;t seem to be that type. <br /><br />I think SR should have a giant 4 fingered cartoon hand that comes out and smacks you upside your head or punches you in the face before you do something that stupid.&nbsp; Probably would have helped my splitting headache.&nbsp; <br /><br />That would mimic government brutality as well, but hey, that&#039;s the price we pay for greatness.

				I believe everyone is entitled to their own decision regarding PGP. I for one am not one of those SUPER paranoid people that think the feds will come for me over my 10$ stamp bag of heroin. If ANYTHING i&#039;ll get a customs letter at most, or a request to come sign for my package at the PO, which i will ignore obviously. There are bigger fish to fry. Don&#039;t get me wrong, if you&#039;re ordering SUPPLIER amounts of drugs, by all means, be paranoid. I just don&#039;t believe that I&#039;m going to get absolutely shit on for very low quantity orders, especially when you can basically say you weren&#039;t expecting a package. For all they know, someone who had a personal problem with me could have done it to set me up, so to speak.&nbsp; Also, not all the things for sale on SR are illegal. The purpose of SR is to be a free market, it is not specifically a drug market, although that is what it&#039;s known for. I believe your opinion is worthy of discussion though, so don&#039;t think I&#039;m bashing what you said. Just keep in mind, even if you don&#039;t PGP your address on an order, it&#039;s CORRECT vendor behavior to not keep addresses, and SR deletes it after the purchase is complete.&nbsp; To each their own, i suppose.

				@ PINE<br /><br />There is NO NEED at all to make FE go away. It is a choice. NO ONE forces you to do FE. In fact the buyers control that. The buyers CHOOSE to use a vendor that requires their customers to FE. And each person has the option...yes option.... to do it or not. As a vendor I do not require it and never would. But there have been times on an order of say 10k that I wanted those coins right away...as I was going to trade them for cash and I wanted the rate right then and there...and even waiting 24 hours would have cost me 5k. So in that case the FE was needed. And my customer had no issue with it at all. The fact is the buyer needs to make that decision.<br /><br />As to the pgp...that is another thing that only affects the buyer...and it only affects the buyer if you believe at one point SR will be compromised and you also believe when compromised that the SR servers will in fact have all the information from messages and from the orders available Even though DPR has stated that information is not saved and even if the servers were compromised that information would not be available.<br /><br />The truth is, the bigger issue is if a vendor keeps the information or not. That is something that would come back to hurt a buyer a lot more then SR being compromised.<br /><br />Also any second year law student can tell you that messages alone are worthless in a criminal case, especially ones from the past, and that even if SR was compromised and they could get messages with addresses and what you ordered from say 1 year ago...or even 1 month ago...that information alone would not get you in trouble.<br /><br />PGP is another layer of security...BUT it is not something that is this big lifesaver. And FE is not something that is a problem. The problem is getting people to understand how things work and what not to d to and what to do.<br /><br />In over 1 year here I can tell you I have witnessed things that buyers do that would blow everyone&#039;s minds. If I didn&#039;t have these things happen to me...I would never believe people are that dumb. THEY ARE.<br /><br />And you would have to be a total idiot if you believed that PGP alone will in any way protect you. There are 10 other things that are more important then PGP. And as to the FE...that is something that will never go away and actually it really can&#039;t. And the beauty of how it now..is YOU HAVE A CHOICE. And I for one like when I have the freedom to choose. And as a buyer if you choose correctly and you have an IQ over 90 you should be able to order and receive your goods on SR with no problem 100% of the time. And in fact I think most buyers do just that.<br />

That would pose a way highrisk then SR getting compromised would you not agree? <br /><br />What has a better chance of happening....1 of the 1000 vendors being an idiot and getting caught...or DPRa getting his servers Compromised and not only that...then DPR would have had to be lying to us and in fact the files are not destroyed at all..they have them...from a year ago in another country.... Now again before it gets to this...you have to believe that DPR is lying to us and does not have things protected... so lets go worse case...it is compromised...SO they have fake names or backdoor into the WWW where they can in no way go after the small time buyers....or the small time vendors. on here. It would be a mess to prosecute..some say impossible.. you have different countries,Interpol,FBI and all of them have to sift through tons of shit.. from who knows when... And in fact if you do not believe that DPR as has covered...can you at least agree that He was/is smart enough to make a mess over there...<br /><br />So again...all this has to heppen...and if it does not happen..it is a 100% waste of time..<br /><br />

				The whole point of PGP is you don&#039;t /have/ to trust DPR or Silk Road (and frankly, you&#039;re a sucker to trust them now).<br /><br />If you use PGP then DPR can be sitting in prison and the site can be hosted on Eric Holder&#039;s personal laptop, it wouldn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />If you sold what I sold, saying PGP is a waste of time might be a defensible position.

Forcing all buyers to learn PGP to make their first order would probably drop volume by at least 75%, but I see no reason not to cajole people into doing the right thing with every possible means short of coercion. Some newbies blissfully dismiss PGP because they haven&#039;t heard of it and think it&#039;s Just Another Technology Acronym, and others occasionally make slips as you&#039;ve had the misfortune yourself.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=152005.msg1055334#msg1055334">Quote from: RxKing on April 26, 2013, 05:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">@ PINE<br /><br />There is NO NEED at all to make FE go away. It is a choice. NO ONE forces you to do FE. In fact the buyers control that. The buyers CHOOSE to use a vendor that requires their customers to FE. And each person has the option...yes option.... to do it or not. As a vendor I do not require it and never would. But there have been times on an order of say 10k that I wanted those coins right away...as I was going to trade them for cash and I wanted the rate right then and there...and even waiting 24 hours would have cost me 5k.

The reality is that several times scammers have stolen more capital than SR&#039;s entire cut per month. This undermines the market&#039;s confidence, it doesn&#039;t help it. In a free market participants have the choice to transact, but that should not be in conflict with doing business appropriately. <br /><br />I understand your point about market volatility, but the solution is not FE, it&#039;s too blunt an instrument, it gives cover to scammers as well as honest vendors. The solution is using BTC option derivatives to control volatility for vendors. As soon as that structure comes into existence, FE has no reason for existence any more and that&#039;s the end of FE scammers. Then everybody gets what they want. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=152005.msg1055334#msg1055334">Quote from: RxKing on April 26, 2013, 05:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As to the pgp...that is another thing that only affects the buyer...and it only affects the buyer if you believe at one point SR will be compromised and you also believe when compromised that the SR servers will in fact have all the information from messages and from the orders available Even though DPR has stated that information is not saved and even if the servers were compromised that information would not be available.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think we have to believe that.

You can always send CIM to a vendor on Ebay, but nobody thinks this is a good idea! SR is a value added service, that is how to see it.<br /><br />LE has historically tried to infiltrate on a network basis, usually moving up the distribution chain, using either communication networks or financial networks.

Our growth is likely to follow that of bacterial growth in an agar dish.<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_growth<br /><br />In the death phase, a small number of the bacteria survive to fight another day due to their adaptive properties. Surrounded by waste and lack of food, they remain dormant until the environmental conditions renew themselves. These more evolved bacteria are super soldiers in comparison to their dying neighbors, because they have a special wall to protect against external environmental conditions. In the case of our system, I believe that protective wall to be secure communications. PGP is a form of disaster insurance, not a panacea. Everybody, including DPR, can have this protection by choosing to use PGP all the time and encouraging its adoption. It&#039;s a blue pill, red pill decision.<br /><br />

You have not studied the Farmer&#039;s Market case study?! I don&#039;t understand why you think this.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is a perfect example and I am glad you brought this up. I have studied it...and the FACTS are the ONLY reason they got caught was because of how they took payments...They processed funds with credit card machines..I mean they actually ran it like a Subway sandwiches would...They took Paypal, Visa, Mastercard ect. Also the government had that fall into there lap. If SR was compromised today.. they could not prosecute one single person based on what they would find on the servers...PERIOD. <br /><br /><br />In this case...PGP would in no way helped the situation.<br /><br />But just because PGP would not have helped&nbsp; is not reason to not use it.. Also I am not against it in any way.. I am just against people saying that using it would save everything. And in doing so you are so much safer. That is simply not true.<br /><br />Again I am not against PGP... I just do not believe it is THE answer. <br /><br />I like the points you make PINE. but you you must admit they come from a very paranoid place. It is almost like talking to a Prep-per. They firmly believe that the government is going to take away guns and money. And they are getting prepared. And there are a lot of others that believe they are just crazy. And it is never going to happen. I guess you can already tell what I believe. But I would never stop them from doing what they are doing. I would tell them to go talk to some of the Y2Kers...as they did the exact same shit...and they believed the exact same thing...<br /><br />I am not trying to compare pgp to Preparers btw...I was just saying that all of this comes from the angle something will happen to SR...and if it does and you use pgp...you will be safer. And I totally disagree.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Also PINE as you know...there have been 100&#039;s of claims on here that so and so vendor got busted and so and so&#039;s package got seized and he is arrested and every single time....they are 100% false. So much so that they have all but stopped...and they use to happen 2-3 times a week. And you and many others would be in there( the thread) believing the bullshit that was said...and after 12 pages...it could come out not true...and everyone would wait for the next thread...and this time it really was true....except it was not.. When I say this was a normal occurrence...I mean that. 1-3 a week&nbsp; and I could dig them up...and every time they came out completely false.&nbsp; And everyone would say it is just a matter of time. And then they would accuse a certain vendor of being a honey hole for LEO...and everyone would jump in...and people swore it was true...and yet again it was 100% false.<br /><br />This went on for months..and it finally stopped. Now we see it less then 1 time per month...and it is usually when someone writes a post and they put SR in the title and they try to make it out like a vendor on SR in Australia was busted...when the facts are it is not true...though I have read a few people...hero members at that...pass on that knowledge that a vendor in AUS was busted..And it is simply not true.<br /><br />Now of course non of this has anything to do with you or with PGP. But it does have to do with a lot of people that swear to pgp...are the same people that are always in these bullshit threads. And I would not doubt that a lot of them are Preparers IRL.

				And instead of A PGP test...they should actually have to pass a BTC test. They also need to pass a Hedged VS un-hedged test.<br /><br />I can not believe how many people do not understand 24 hour weighted average and how great it is that SR uses it. <br /><br />Also just as unreal, maybe even more so, how many vendors&nbsp; do not understand Hedging their listings vs not.<br /><br /><br />Both those things are more important then PGP.&nbsp; The ones to past the PGP test should be buyers. Or even better SR users.&nbsp; <br /><br />The one thing that is kind of strange is how bothered some people are that others do not use PGP. It is NO WAY affects them. And before the idiot says &quot; it affects them if it is a vendor that does not use it&quot; Actually no it does not. DO NOT USE THAT VENDOR. Just like if you do not like FE. GREAT! Do not use a vendor that requires it! Simple!<br />&nbsp;<br />Also has anyone else realized how much less scamming there is since the vendor fee went up? And that with the affect the Mods have had at getting the information across to not do BTC for Money Pack with anyone other then a trusted vendor. Yes scamming still happens and it always will no matter what. The simple fact is the more education there is for the newbies the better! I think it is great what DPR has done and it is also great what he has not done. You never going to make everyone happy and since that is a fact, it is better to have less regulation and let everyone choose on there own what to do then to make everyone do 1 thing. Some people are just not as paranoid as others. And some people like choices.

PGP would be more secure than privnote if you were using a 2 bit public key. Hell, plaintext is superior!
