				In the SR advice to new buyers section, there&#039;s a sentence that goes like this: &#039;Anyone can send anybody anything in the mail.&#039; This suggests LE cannot bust you for simply receiving illegal substances via the post because, it may have been mailed to you by mistake, etc. and it would be hard to prove otherwise. This may be true in countries with a rule of law and a rational legal system.<br /><br />I was in a Gulf Arab country last month and read in a local paper that an Asian woman was facing a long prison sentence followed by deportation for receiving narcotics in the mail. Her protestations of innocence mean nothing. In that country, simply receiving a package full of goodies with your name on the address = guilty.

				I&#039;m following this interesting UK story:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A PARCEL containing £224,000 of cocaine was sent from Nigeria to a shop in Northampton town centre and signed for by a member of staff, a jury heard.<br /><br />Christiana Ubah, 26, is accused of plotting to smuggle the cocaine into the UK after it was delivered by an undercover officer to her work place in Abington Street, Northampton in November last year.<br /><br />A jury at Northampton Crown Court heard today how the parcel was intercepted at Parcel Force’s Coventry depot having been posted in Nigeria and contained four bottles of cosmetics.<br /><br />Kate Tompkins, prosecuting at Northampton Crown Court, said the bottles were opened and inside officers found plastic bags containing 846 grams of cocaine with a 61 per cent purity.<br /><br />She said: “This defendant came to the UK from Nigeria in 2004 in order to study and since 2009, she has been living in Northampton and working at the O2 shop in Abington Street.<br /><br />“On Thursday, November 17 last year, at 1.55pm, a parcel declared as containing cosmetics arrived at Parcel Force’s hub in Coventry from Nigeria. It was addressed to the O2 shop where the defendant worked in Northampton and the sender was listed as Rose Ubah.<br /><br />“It had been sent on November 9 and was opened by officers of the UK Border Agency.”<br /><br />The jury heard the parcel held four bottles of body lotion but concealed within the bottles were clear plastic bags containing the cocaine which was mixed with cuttings agents.<br /><br />Miss Tompkins added: “On Tuesday, November 22 that parcel, without the cocaine which had been removed, was delivered to the defendant at her work place by an undercover officer posing as a Parcel Force delivery man. The defendant identified herself and signed to accept the parcel.<br /><br />“As she was walking to the back of the shop with the parcel in her hands, she was arrested.”<br /><br />Once officers examined her bank account, they found £2,600 had been paid in via two instalments on November 14 and she had withdrawn it all and then paid it into different account.<br /><br />Miss Tompkins said: “She was interviewed on the day of her arrest and denied any knowledge of drugs in the parcel. She told the police officers her family lived in Nigeria and some times she would receive letters and parcels from them.<br /><br />“She said no one had told her anything would be sent to her and she said she had only accepted it because her name was on the parcel. The defendant denied being in debt and initially denied any large sums of money had been paid into her account.<br /><br />“When told the police would examine her account, she stated £2,600 had been paid in by her boyfriend who had asked her to transfer it to his sister’s account.”<br /><br />Ubah, of Wellington Street, Northampton denies knowing of the drugs’ consignment and has pleaded not guilty to fraudulent evasion of prohibition and conspiracy to supply class A drugs.<br /><br />The trial continues.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Source:<br />http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/crime/cocaine-worth-224-000-posted-from-nigeria-to-o2-worker-in-northampton-1-3921442

				Fuck man.. <br /><br />Perhaps it could be because the sender was listed as her mum? <br /><br />There is probably other evidence that we don&#039;t know about that was only shown during the case. Like if they found coke in her house or something like that, it would vastly increase the case against her<br /><br />I still can&#039;t imagine that a parcel alone would be able to convict you. Even with your mum listed as the sender. It just doesn&#039;t seem like enough evidence. But perhaps I&#039;m wrong

				In Canada the real criminals are the politicians... But this must be the same almost everywhere. I have seen an history of a guy (American) that temporally worked in China or something like that and he meet a women at a Jazz Club then he invited her at his hotel room, the day after police has arrested the guy for using the services of a prostitute .. he had never paid her for any services at all, police is corrupt in many countries..

For instance, convictions are secured because the accused are confronted with evidence of what they did while they are on the stand and a picture would be pained by the prosecution using a technique similar to the Reid technique used in the US. But face being what it is, the accused almost always admit their crimes right there because of the loss of face and shame they feel of being called out on their crime and being seen so blatantly as a liar. It&#039;s bizarre. So you have these confessionals in court where the accused finishes describing exactly what they did and how it happened.<br /><br />This method of shaming suspects seems to be a great method of determining the guilty from innocent while questioning too.

				Fuck no one gets a fair trail in the USA, almost every fed case ends in conviction. They just leave you in pretrial for years until they get you to plead guilty. They freeze your assets so you cant defend yourself . The only way to get a remote fair shake in the US is to demand a jury trial and insist on a speedy trial, this is were most people fuck up. <br /><br />As for the UK women, the reason she was convicted was her skin color. I suspect people would believe her claim if she was white. A black immigrant in the UK is not a popular person. As for the japs, they only prosecute absolute air tight cases, if its not 100% they take a pass on it. Thats how they are able to claim such a high conviction rate, look at their unsolved murder rate....

But yeah, most prosecutors approach who they&#039;re accusing with the attitude of &quot;well if I can&#039;t convict, I&#039;m going to make sure this perp loses everything else he values in his fucking life and is acquitted a broke motherfucker&quot;.
