				As you can see, I&#039;m being calm about this. It&#039;s worrying the shit out of me, but bitching on here isn&#039;t going to help and I know that. I just need help. <br /><br />My problem is that I sent 118.02 bitcoins from VirWox.com to my current Silk Road address while the site came back up on the 19th, but never received them. I had generated a new address at the time before sending them. I also realize I should have been patient and used a different site, a coin tumbler, and/or sent them to my computer first. I was naive, I admit that. Anyways, I believe they would have made it to my SR account if VirWox hadn&#039;t have done one of their bullshit, random transaction holds requiring manual approval. The transaction was approved that day, but when the site went down again. I should have just used Mt.Gox and Dwolla, but I was an idiot. I admit fault and I regret my impatience, but I don&#039;t think I deserve the punishment of losing that much money. I honestly did not anticipate this.<br /><br />So, because I know this is necessary, I will provide all needed proof that I own HerpDerpiTor on the main site and that I&#039;m not lying about this whole ordeal. I just don&#039;t want to just post all information on here, or should I? Should I send those details directly to Silk Road through a private message on the forums? Should I just wait for them to notice this thread? I need some advice on this situation. I&#039;m optimistic because on the Site Outage thread &#039;Silk Road&#039; said <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, for everyone concerned about missing bitcoin deposits, do not worry.&nbsp; We will get it sorted out and your account will be credited one way or another.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />I really hope that is true. Please, give me advice about what I should do. Thanks in advance.&nbsp; :-[

				my best understanding about BTC transfers is that the block chain is audit able, so you didnt lose anything. - the wallet or exchange that you sent the BTC to has the transaction manifest, and the receiving account was unavailable, so therefore the transaction was not logged.&nbsp; Its a great system, in that coins dont go into unrecoverable limbo, but can be traced back to the origin and resent to the destination accounts. Dont worry/

				I&#039;m in kinda same situation. Generated a new address a couple hours before SR went down and sent them from my e-wallet to SR, but still nothing.. <br />Hope this gets resolved in a way or another, let&#039;s have some faith in SR..

I&#039;m not very knowledgeable of how the BTC algorithm works, so this is new to me. Should I contact the SR directly about this? I&#039;ve seen at least one person say they were in direct communication with the SR. That is done by contacting &#039;Silk Road&#039; through the forums, correct? I&#039;m sorry if this seems like a dumb question, but I just want to make sure I&#039;m doing everything properly. I&#039;ve fucked up enough already...

				I am not a SR admin or even an experienced user. I have studied the BTC transaction mechanism from an academic / professional perspective, and you did not lose any BTC due to the outage. Well, probably not. Bitcoin was designed for Peer to peer transfers of digital coin tokens. The transfer mechanism has to be tolerant of outages, communications problems, etc. Since there is no ACID guarantee, they use an audit trail called a block chain that records all generated bitcoins and where they were intended to be transferred.&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, any transaction is visible to everyone, Bitcoins cant be spent more than once in duplicate transactions, etc.<br /><br />But you gotta, you just must give the SR staff some time to sift through the BTC transaction manifests - and that will take awhile. Hell, they just weathered a massive outage and are getting their legs under them. In the meantime you can read up on hopw Bitcoins work at bitcoins.org? Search it.<br /><br />PATIENCE PEOPLE, there is no such thing as a lost bitcoin, unless the wallet file is compromised.

				hey all, it&#039;s a little mixed up, but we&#039;ve been able to track down everyone&#039;s coins that are missing so far.&nbsp; Just message us on the main site with the address they were sent to and the amount of the deposit.
