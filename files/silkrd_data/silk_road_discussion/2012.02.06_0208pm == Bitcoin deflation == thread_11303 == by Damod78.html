				Is that all?&nbsp; You should go to http://bitcoincharts.com/ and look at some past jumps in prices.<br /><br />As for your questions;&nbsp; <br /><br />1. It&#039;s most likely pro traders dumping these coins.<br />2. I&#039;m pretty sure most vendors peg their prices at a dollar amount and SR does all the exchanges automagicly.<br /><br />FYI - The act of a currency losing value is called &quot;Inflation&quot;.<br /><br />Straight from Wikipedia:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In economics, inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.&nbsp; When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services.&nbsp; Consequently, inflation also reflects an erosion in the purchasing power of money â€“ a loss of real value in the internal medium of exchange and unit of account in the economy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				yeah i guess it is inflation.<br />who the hell are pro traders though?&nbsp; it&#039;s not like wall street is in on this currency.<br />i always felt that of the millions of bitcoins out there, there are a cabal of basement dwellers with like 50% of all the bitcoins in circulation.&nbsp; then one day whenever they decide (probably when the exchange rate favors them) they will dump everything and the bitcoin will crash.

				I&#039;ll step in and just let you know that inflation and deflation are both terms that actually measure the quantity of money, not the value.&nbsp; Price changes are an effect of inflation.&nbsp; Inflation is actually the increase in the total amount of money, deflation being a contraction of the same.<br /><br />The result in inflation is rising prices because more digits exist to represent the same amount of goods.&nbsp; Supply and demand.&nbsp; Delfation is the opposite.<br /><br />Bitcoin is constantly &quot;inflating&quot; in that there are more coins generated into existence daily than the previous day.&nbsp; The offset to this is more and more merchants and customers using them to exchange goods.&nbsp; The value is so insane right now because it does not take that much capital to move the market in a huge way.<br /><br />Also, the most likely source of these huge swings is miners selling off their coins, which they have generated and weren&#039;t previously accounted for in the bitcoin economy.&nbsp; When they are sold they put downward pressure on the prices.&nbsp; What we really need is an exchange to work with a bitcoin float and start allowing short selling - this puts a strong bid on any significant declines and shorts cover.&nbsp; If you watch large financial markets, I always cringe when short-selling on a particular stock or commodity is outlawed to keep the price up (shows what the political class know about how markets work).&nbsp; Usually you see MAJOR drops right after, because nobody HAS to buy to cover and lock in profits.&nbsp; It&#039;s a falling knife at this point.&nbsp; Recent good example are Euro bank stocks - short selling was banned and they took another 20% haircut FAST.

				&quot;that moment you realize you should of payed more attention in econ101&quot;<br /><br />so most of your post went flying above my head but would what your saying be hard to implement into the market?&nbsp; i already see that mt. gox and tradehill have buy and sell orders available, could the powers that be change the market so resembles something more like a common exchange like nasdaq?<br /><br />sidenote - i just saw the one year graph and want to know what the hell happened last june when the price went up to $28?&nbsp; was this the result of the gawker article and a whole new flock of buyers coming into the market or something else.

				I&#039;ll have to disagree with anarcho47 on one point, I doubt that miners suddenly decided to sell 120k bitcoins yesterday.&nbsp; Even if that entire amount was sold at the low for the day ($5.45 USD) that would equate to approximately $654,000.&nbsp; Looking at Mt. Gox directly it looks like there were 3 major spikes in volume yesterday for 17k, 26k, and 30k.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anyone who mines that is sitting on anything near that quantity of BTC.

				Oh, I&#039;m not discounting traders at all.&nbsp; But I personally know a couple of people who have run guzzling mining rigs since the early days, and one of them is still sitting on about 150k coins from that.&nbsp; He dumps them off as they hit certain price targets, so one of those very well might have been him.&nbsp; Or a seller on here cashing out.&nbsp; who knows.

				http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg10zig2-hourztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />^ 10 day / 2 hourly chart<br /><br />My speculation:<br /><br />[-] If &quot;the manipulator&quot; didn&#039;t have a hand in it...<br />[-] Last week we had the media exposure, we had the SR weekend sale, therefore significant increase in buy/volume. = RISE.<br />[-] The weekend sale is over, vendors cashing out coins, buyers trading their spare coin back to cash.<br />[-] Speculators who had their finger on the pulse *also* perpetuated the wave because they made the very same prediction. = FALL.<br />[-] So between the speculators and the SR, enough volume was traded to case the rise and fall.<br /><br />The $5.40 -&gt; $6.10 -&gt; $ 5.40 wave is not a new phenonema.. and by no means is it a huge fluctuation.<br /><br />I *almost* started a speculation thread before the weekend sale to talk about this very prediction. But decided against it because such talk only serves to perpetuate the cause.<br /><br />^ sure that can never be known for sure, but as speculation goes...

				does bitcoinica have anything close to the volume of Gox though?&nbsp; I dont&#039; use gox much anymore, and I&#039;ve thought about doing some on bitcoinica, but how&#039;s the liquidity over there?
