				A couple other people are having the same problem.&nbsp; Looks like an SR issue.&nbsp; I believe you should normally post something like this in the Technical Support section.<br /><br />I imagine they will get it fixed shortly.

				Same issue. I posted it in the tech issues and sent sr a message.. It sucks not being able to WD coin when you want..I have even tried transferring it to a another account. It was successful doing that, but still couldn&#039;t get it off into my wallet..Sr to SR was fine. Just SR to anywhere off silk road=no..
