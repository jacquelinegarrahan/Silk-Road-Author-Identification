				I sent nearly 200 BTC to 2 separate accounts from 2 separate wallets. It&#039;s been over 12 hours and I&#039;ve received nothing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten responses back from SR on the forums but not from PMs....<br /><br />I can&#039;t afford to lose this kind of money. SR isnt worth it if this kind of shit happens.

				100 bitcoins have also not made their way to my account. It was about 19 hours ago and i have 70+ confirmations but i don&#039;t have it yet.<br /><br />I have now lost more money with fake sellers and losing this transfer than i have actually spent on myself. I am a fucking idiot.

				your coins are lost in cyber space. you unfortunately Trudy sending btc during a server/site restore. the addresses u sent those btc to most likely do not exist anymore.&nbsp; sorry.&nbsp; that is the only explanation there is.&nbsp; &nbsp; it seems SR does not have a bounce back feature either.&nbsp; which there should be in case things like this happen. <br /><br />this is just my logical guess from being a site owner that has nothing to do with SR or anything.

				I am also missing BTC in my Silk Road account that were sent on the 18th and 19th. I have been in communication with SR. He could not find record of the first transactions address being in the database. At this point, he also told me not to use old addresses (which I don&#039;t too all the time, I usually remember to generate a new one.) We also discussed the possibility of me sending the BTC to a different, non-SR related account on accident.<br /><br />In the mean time, I sent more BTC to a newly generated Silk Road address. These never arrived at my account, either. I know for a fact the address I sent to is the one currently set as my profile on SR.<br /><br />104.97BTC missing from my Silk Road account so far. I realize nothing will get addressed until the site is back up, but hope SR can promptly resolve this issue once SR is stable.
