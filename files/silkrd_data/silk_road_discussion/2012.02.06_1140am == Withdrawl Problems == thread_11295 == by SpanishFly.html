				Either SR is ducking out with the fuckload of coins that got dumped into the system this weekend........................ &lt;/sarcasm&gt; (hopefully).<br /><br />This happens to me a couple of times a week.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what kind of backend system they are using for bitcoin on SR, so just flip a message to SR Support with the timestamp for your transaction (on your account page) and they will sort you out shortly.

				This is all very disconcerting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen so many posts about errors occurring with withdrawals; money not showing up, money disappearing.&nbsp; Yes, they usually get it back, but still.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t this a bit of a turn-off to new buyers?&nbsp; Can&#039;t something be done about this?

				This is the longest thus far it&#039;s taken SR to resolve the issue for me.&nbsp; If my funds aren&#039;t showing up by tomorrow I&#039;ll be putting my account in vacation mode until it gets resolved and canceling my unprocessed orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anarcho47
