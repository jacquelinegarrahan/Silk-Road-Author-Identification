				I just started using tor and silk road 3 days ago, when I was able to see everything, and today I can&#039;t even go on, it&#039;s asking for a username and password which I don&#039;t remeber creating, probably never did, and it&#039;s not allowing new members. Do you know when they will start allowing new members?<br />Is the Black Market Reloaded a safe alternative to purchase prescription and others?

				my guess is sm777 likes to look at pictures of animals that have been photoshopped to look like they&#039;re having sex with trees.

				i think what the nimrod who appears to be using a real name (or the genius who is using the real name of someone he hates) is saying is this...<br /><br />fuck knows what you&#039;ve been seeing for the last 3 days pal, but it wasn&#039;t Silk Road. it&#039;s been down for 3 days, and it&#039;s always required you to register.

				the aussie has summarised my position accurately.<br /><br />if this isn&#039;t a really, really, ridiculously good looking (i mean shithouse) ad for BMR, i will eat my own ass.<br /><br />EDIT: i dont actually like eating ass, so this would be a bad thing. not a good thing. definitely not a good thing.
