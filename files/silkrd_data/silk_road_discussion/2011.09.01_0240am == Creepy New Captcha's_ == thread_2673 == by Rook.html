				Whoah. Something or someone is DEFINITELY trying to tell you something. My Captcha was &quot;state&quot; with a few numbers tonight (I did think that somewhat ironic). I think they changed part of the captcha process, which is good because it was taking me 4-6 times to log in with how hard they were. <br /><br />That being said, yours are friggin creepy. I&#039;d take heed, my friend...take heed.

				my guess is they made a change in the selection algorithm for the captcha; it seems like it&#039;s using stems of dictionary words for the first several characters.&nbsp; i for one, welcome our new captcha algorithm overlords.&nbsp; imo, it probably doesn&#039;t make it much easier for a bot to login, and yet it makes it easier for us real humans (looks around) to perform what is an inconvenient part of the process.<br /><br />reminds me of a good password generator out there called SOPPG (sort-of-pronounceable password generator)

				this is perfectly normal optimization being introduced here.<br />the purpose of the captcha is to make OCR (Optical Character Recognition) difficult for a machine, so that no mass spamming / account creation can take place. to a computer program doing OCR it is irrelevant if the characters have a meaning or not (though one could argue that brute force dictionary attack could be easier, but since those are random, then it&#039;s a moot point) BUT it makes it much easier for a person to get it right. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I fucked up the random ones. The new ones are much easier to punch in!<br /><br />Good job devs!

I&#039;d advise everyone to stay alert and make sure to report any suspicious activity from the SR captcha.&nbsp; I believe SR has become infested with some sort of bit-spook.

				I look forward to the captcha each tiime I log in.&nbsp; More times than not it is something that&#039;s at least a little macabre--decap713, exsang75, noose101 etc.&nbsp; Thrills my twisted soul...

Your bot would be laughably terrible if you just used a list of stuff people have already encountered. Roughly speaking, given the random-number at the end of the words, you&#039;d have a 1 in 1000 chance of your bot getting the captcha right. It would be easier to program it with the ability to figure out what the text is.
