				Hi yall!<br /><br />I am so excited about this place! I finally don&#039;t have to drive to the ghetto and be terrified of getting ripped off, robbed or raped by the people that live there! Finally ready to have some real incentive to do my calculus homework (Ok if you do problems 1 - 59, you can haaavvve..... THAT LINE!!) I don&#039;t have ANYONE in real life that I could ever talk to about this place, so I just have to come and gush on the forums to you guys.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am also extremely nervous, everything seems a little overwhelming right now, but I&#039;m following the detailed guide as closely as possible, but I&#039;m still very anxious... mostly about going to deposit cash at the bank tomorrow for coins. And about getting my presents, and about, well everything but what&#039;s fun without a little adrenaline first?! My suboxone scripts are so getting shoved in the back of my closet from now on until this place disappears someday.<br /><br />Reading through the forums for just gives me such a smile to see such intelligent, friendly, well spoken individuals conversing on my fav topics! Hope to get to know you guys and make some great relationships!<br /><br />

				Ya once I found this place, I had a boner that lasted for more than 4 hours.&nbsp; I ended up going to the doctor, and he said..&quot;did you see magic mike twice in a row&quot;&nbsp; I was all caught... and told him yes.&nbsp; And then we danced.&nbsp; <br /><br />The day my first order arrived, I danced and called my partner in crime and we danced some more.&nbsp; I love this place.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Be smart, don&#039;t tell your friends about it word spreads quick.&nbsp; It is very safe if you are just not an idiot about it.&nbsp;

				I feel like Leo DiCaprio in that movie The Beach! Except I won&#039;t leave a map I promise.<br /><br />I know I kept thinking, this can&#039;t be, this can&#039;t be... then heard the munchkins singing for me to follow the yellow brick road and I knew I had to.<br /><br />And no way would I ever tell someone about this treasure trove! I don&#039;t have any friends anyway, just a bunch of acquaintances. The only friends I have from now on are goin up my nasals! Or in my mouth! Or in my arms! I can&#039;t decide which to do first! After working 10 hours a day then having to sit through class all night all I want to do is come home, get some chicken mcnuggets with sweet &amp; sour, maybe an iced lemonade, cuddle up with my fluffy cats, and get out of my mind in front of cartoons. Now I can come and join in the convos with you guys!

				Ya this site is only between my buddy who I&#039;ve known my whole life and me.&nbsp; No one else but us.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a good job, and buying from drug dealers got too sketchy the older I get.&nbsp; Ever spend a ton of money on some product you were promised was great, and it sucked and ruined your night?&nbsp; FUCK THAT SHIT.&nbsp; That is very easily avoided, follow the rumor mill, read up on the good vendors and you will be golden.&nbsp;

				OK I got an avatar. It will do for now.<br /><br />I know, right?! Where I live the people are so shady and flaky, there have been so many times I think, &quot;Does this person NOT like money or something?! Do they NOT like repeat business? Do they NOT want me to come to them, and hand them cool crisp bills?&quot; I talk to them in the morning and it seems all good, and all day work and everything and everyone sucks but I&#039;m like, it&#039;s ok, because after this I get to go meet so-and-so! Then I get in my car, text them and sometimes they still say &quot;Yeah, meet me here&quot; and I&#039;m like cool! I&#039;m on my way! Drive an insane distance across town, sit in a parking lot FOREVER, and they suddenly disappear off the face of the earth.<br /><br />Last time the guy actually met me, then got in my car and said &quot;We just gotta drive over to this house real quick, that&#039;s where it is&quot; I thought it sounded weird but what choice did I have? So ok, drive the dude like 10 miles to some house, he goes in and leaves me sitting in the driveway for like 30 min. Comes back out and says, &quot;Oh they were out, just take me over here real quick&quot;. We go to another house. The same thing happens and everytime he comes out he looks higher and higher. Turns out I was just giving this bum fuck homeless jerk off rides to various crack houses for him to go in and get high in. All I wanted was some freaking oxy.<br /><br />Or the rare times I have found someone it starts out ok but after awhile they get like, offended or something that I only want to meet and make a quick pick up, then leave. They want a best friend or something, and I just don&#039;t have time for that. They get upset that I don&#039;t want to sit and &quot;hang&quot; with them for hours everytime I call. And it is so hard to make connects if you don&#039;t &quot;live in the lifestyle&quot; so to speak. I work for a super christian company, I have the freakin 10 commandments posted above my cubicle and shit. I can&#039;t relate to those people! But money is money is when you live in a small place like I do you don&#039;t have many options.
