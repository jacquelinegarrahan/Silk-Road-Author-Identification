				your fucked bud. you might get a refund or &#039;reship&#039; if u keep 5/5,&nbsp; weather hes scamming or not, he SUCKS. only reason he has 87 rating is because he demands u keep 5/5 or no refund/reship......nobody thinks about the fact 75% of his orders don&#039;t show up in the first place, regardless of refund/reship....SHIT VENDOR, STOP ORDERING and spam foums for the removal of this fuck from the road. he has caused SOOOOOO many problems for 1000&#039;s of ppl but hes still here. WHY?

				I feel bad for him sometimes, seems like he just gets way overwhelmed and cant cope with all the orders and then just runs away for a bit. Still if he cant cope he shouldnt be vending. I ordered from him once and it was fairly smooth but i dont think i would do it again!!

				pretty shit situation, i dont get why people go for the big boys like supertrips when ordering. stick to the small time dealers. They spend more time on packaging and wont fuck you over because they dont have a big customer base to fall back on.

				Because DPR and the staff see some merit to keeping him around.<br />Personally, I haven&#039;t had any problems with him.&nbsp; Placed a couple of large orders even after his ratings dropped and they went smoothly. <br />Waiting on another now as it were.

I have absolutely no idea.&nbsp; His presence in SR does nothing but hurt the integrity of the site and its staff, IMHO.&nbsp; There are plenty of vendors looking to step up and move in on his territory once he leaves.

				I assume that they keep supertrips around because they do make sr a lot o&#039; cash, and sr has already invested a lot into the guys. I have been ordering from supertrips off and on for I think 8 months now, and while I dropped em&#039; for that whole money laundering crisis or whatever the fuck that was, they otherwise have always been honest to me. Also, I have never finalized early for them.. my shit always ships anyway. At the end of the day as always it is up to the buyer to stay abreast of the market and do one&#039;s research before dropping coins. <br />Honestly it seems like the majority of supertrips problems arise from scaling.. supertrips is a large vendor both on the road, and i can only imagine irl. Logistics for an operation of that size is likely daunting.. I&#039;m not excusing lackluster service, I am just saying that supertrips is not realistically going to get arbitrarily booted from the road for missing some 50 pill orders.. I mean they supply other major vendors on the road for heavens sake. <br />It&#039;s that too big to fail shit all over again. That&#039;s business.<br />
