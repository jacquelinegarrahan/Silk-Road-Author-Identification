				Before I get started these questions were not written by me but were written by a friend who is not a user of the road but for his degree is writing a essay on the deep internet and quite a large portion of the essay will be focusing on silk road. If you find any of the questions too intrusive and worry they may give away personal information then just skip the question. Before anyone accuses me neither me or my friend are LE just two students and since I have more of a knowledge on the subject I said I would post these questions for his research. The questions are geared towards people who use the deep web for uses other than drugs so just ignore anything in the questions irrelevant to you. Anyway thanks for your time and I&#039;m hoping for a decent range of responses to help the road come across well in this piece of work. <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How did you first hear about the deep internet?<br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How many times have you used the deep internet to purchase illicit items?<br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What has your buying experience been like?<br />4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a user, how have your views changed?<br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do you see as the positives of the deep internet?<br />6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What about the negatives?<br />7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How do you view the open distribution of illicit drugs / weapons / content on the deep internet? Do you feel it is morally acceptable for people to purchase these items if they wish?<br />8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do you feel this is a safer alternative to buying such items on the street?<br />9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do you think this sort of market place should be readily available?
