				1. Distributes load off the market server. I&#039;m sure everyone noticed how slow the market server has been lately.<br />2. If this server is hacked (which so many are worrying about) the worst that can happen is they will be able to post under your name. Oh noes.<br />3. No hidden service is logging IPs as everyone is worried about. Your IP shows up as 127.0.0.1 which is local loopback.<br />4. If market server goes down, we aren&#039;t left out in the dark.<br />5. The forum software is open source. This is a good thing because anyone can review the code for holes, therefore it is less likely to have them.<br />6. The forum software has the advanced features that were needed.<br />7. Developers can now focus on improving the marketplace instead of reinventing the wheel (forum).<br /><br />Discuss
