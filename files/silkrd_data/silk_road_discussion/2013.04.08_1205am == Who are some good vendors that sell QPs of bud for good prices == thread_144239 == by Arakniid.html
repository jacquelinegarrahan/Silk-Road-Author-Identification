				Hello.....Here is my 02. cents.....and a few questions.....so you want those prices, so you can make more money selling it on the streets?&nbsp; Most of the time when I meet or talk to <br />people like you.....you want it at the lowest price you can get....of course you want it trimmed perfect....most likey an OG...(which are low yielding strains)...you want is to have perfect smell...and has to have that<br />smell it through the bag stink...you want big sticky...huge nugs.....that are coated with sugar type trichomes.....and organic...........How am I doing so far?.....most likely you have never grown<br />dank stuff before and have no idea...what it takes to grow.....how much time it takes to produce dank stuff........your thinking is &quot;YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE A BOAT LOAD OF MONEY&#039;&quot;....<br /><br />hey i understand that.....but your thinking is totally wrong.....this business is about getting a good connection....and you are never going to get one offering those prices......sure you may get some poor desperate sole to off a couple of qp&#039;s to you.....but what you really need is a connection....who has exactly what you need....and can get it to you when you need it.....right?....because if you have it you can sell it right?....you may make a little less money on each transaction, but you will easily make that up by always having what you client want......Am I making any sense to you?<br /><br />I have quite a few guys just like you .....2 orders a week....every week.....they are way happy, as soon as they get a order....it&#039;s gone.....they have standing orders......this was way way before I joined SR.....<br /><br />some people have the misconception that the grower should really take care of the broker/re-seller.....it really the other way around.....that connection/grower should be cherished....and those guys I descried above<br />do that.....and as the grower....when they need their stuff they are at the front of the line.......what you describe does none of than.......<br /><br />Guys with your quest.....never get a phone call returned.....because there are 20 guys just like you.....but guys who understand the business....are always at the front of the line...and their business is excellent.<br /><br />good luck

				NW Nugz is also offering higher end stuff at 850/Qp. I agree with what medicalcannibas420 was saying, of course. On top of it being expensive and time-consuming and nerve-wracking to produce QP&#039;s of great indoor, stealth packing and shipping and USPS shennanigans are a real pain. Plus there is listing and inventory maintainance, customer service and forum presence and ..........<br /><br />That said, I think the OP may be someone who is willing to take lower quality to get the lower price. I think a lot of bigger buyers look for that as well. I&#039;d guess there was more of that around in the Fall when North American outdoor harvests came in. I&#039;d guess people who sell larger amounts tend to meet people who buy larger amounts and then we don&#039;t see those sellers with public offerings as often. In other words, I think if anyone had really good stuff that cheap they would get regular customers that would buy all they had before it got listed on SR publicly.<br /><br />Also, If I am reading the tea-leaves accurately, SR is tapping a huge and growing buyer pool while the vendors supply is lagging behind that growth. I&#039;d expect that to be more obvious in later Summer when demand peaks and domestic supplies usually tighten up. If these prices remain stable, I think growers will boost output (which takes time) and prices will eventually drop some, especially for lower grades of bud. I would also not be surprised to see massive supply arrive soon from mega-suppliers domestic or nearby foreign that have seen this thing recently and are gearing up to flood this market as best they can. What kind of mega-supplier will determine the quality they would offer. I have no idea which of the types, I imagine could show up, will, if any. Exciting times on the Road :-)<br /><br />

				Excellent post NM nugs.......supply is already tightening up....when I came to SR in January there were over 2000 listings for weed....now there is way less than that.<br /><br />As far as Cali outdoor....all the good stuff is mostly gone...and prices have been rising for almost a month....and it will continue to rise all the way till October harvest.....will there be light dept...yes...but not enough to effect the market from rising.<br /><br />With all the rules and regulations...and major busts happening....I do not believe supply will rise much in Cali....now Washington and Colorado that is a different story....and remains to be seen.<br /><br />To the original poster, I am sorry if I hijacked you thread.......but really you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=144239.msg990204#msg990204">Quote from: NW Nugz on April 08, 2013, 02:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NW Nugz is also offering higher end stuff at 850/Qp.

				I&#039;m kind of hesitant to say, because I want to keep him for myself, but Brutusk is amazing for qp&#039;s.<br /><br />He sells them at 720.00 which is fucking ridiculous considering the quality bud you get.<br /><br />He always has amazing and exotic strains, and keeps his stock fresh.<br /><br />He&#039;s a great communicator and takes his security very seriously.<br /><br />He&#039;s basically everything I like in a vendor.<br /><br />US Domestic, check him out. He will work with you to get what you want, he&#039;s a people pleaser.<br /><br />Tell him FS sent you ;)

I have a small grow op and I know what kind of work you have to put in to produce high quality cannabis, my grow op is pretty small I maybe get around a HP in 2 1/2 - 4 months of work I can only imagine what its like for a huge grower with Pounds and pounds so I would never try and low ball a grower because without them theres no &quot;us&quot;.<br /><br />I appreciate your .02 cents but maybe next time you should keep it to yourself
