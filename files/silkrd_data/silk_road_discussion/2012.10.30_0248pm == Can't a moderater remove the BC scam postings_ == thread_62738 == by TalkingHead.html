				I wonder if people are falling for this shit. I mean this dude can&#039;t be making that much money off this, hope he&#039;s using a bot because that&#039;s a lot of wasted time to copy and paste that shit over and over with tor&#039;s slow speed.

				i posted this in another topic but since its about the same<br /><br />seriously whats with all the bitcoin mtix buybtc whatever thefucking thing is called its irritatating, a simple script can do it, doesnt sr have programmers on call waiting to be paid in bitcoins and drugs,&nbsp; that was the job description I got =D<br />also people dont post pone them, if anything when you see one go to a topic you have interest and make a post to push if off the newest topics when refreshed.<br /><br />anyway SR I believe you could easily take some effective measures against this, because gd!#@ its irritating<br /><br />and yes with coders good with scripting and sql they should be able to ban any repeating topics, etc....<br /><br />also its simple put a restriction on users under 60 days where they can only post 3 times in one hour and 12 times total per day<br /><br />or something to that effect

				CoolGrey&#039;s anti spam suggestions:<br /><br />- Block anyone with less than 200 posts from using the word &quot;btkoin&quot; in post.<br />- Block new users from making more than one threads with the same name.<br />- Assign a team of spam busters that can hide posts until a mod has verified or deleted them.<br />

				I think it is a phenomenal idea to limit new users to 3 posts per hour/12 per day or something similar.&nbsp; Maybe up to 30 posts.&nbsp; At least they would have to waste a few days making bs accounts and bs posts before spamming the shit out of our beloved forum.&nbsp; New people should spend most of their time on here reading vs posting anyway (in a perfect world).&nbsp; <br /><br />What new user needs to post more than 3 times per hour?

				Isn&#039;t there an easier way to block bots, like setting it so you can&#039;t post 2 identicle messages?<br />or stopping bots getting on here and creating accounts.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m not a code person but surely there&#039;s a few techies on here who can sort this out.

				Anybody who actually *buys* from one of these phishing spam should immediately thrown off the site for stupidity.&nbsp; And I too thinks a block should be put in place where newbs should only be allowed about 3 msgs for day.&nbsp; Need to listen and study up in the beginning anyway...go through all the early posts on Security, all kinds of shit you could be doing....but these btkoin bastards should be stopped, can&#039;t be *that* hard to throw some code together limiting post amounts for new members...
