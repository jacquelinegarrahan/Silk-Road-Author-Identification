				Hello, everyone, I&#039;m truenull.<br /><br />A few months ago, I discovered multiple serious security holes in Silk Road: XSS, SQL injection, a vulnerability allowing the discovery of the Silk Road host server&#039;s public (non-Tor) IP, and CSRF.<br /><br />Yesterday, I forgot my PIN (fuck me, right?) and figured I&#039;d just wait 7 days for it to be reset, but...<br /><br />A few hours later, there was downtime similar to today&#039;s. Attempts to connect to the silkroadvb5piz3r.onion website were met with a failed connection, and a message in the Tor logs indicating a server-side problem.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[Notice] Closing stream for &#039;[scrubbed].onion&#039;: hidden service is unavailable (try again later).</code> <br /><br />After that downtime, there was a brief period allowing logins, then more downtime, but of a different sort. It seemed that there was an issue with the SR webapp or database itself- session cookies were repeatedly invalidated, and users were thus constantly kicked back to /silkroad/home (the login page), even after entering valid credentials and CAPTCHA.<br /><br />During this downtime, I (stupidly) decided to do some additional testing, attempting to create a new account with the same username as my existing account (truenull). It kicked me back to /silkroad/home, and I thought nothing of it... until the downtime ended.<br /><br />I logged in normally- and my account was as if it had been newly created. Balance of 0 BTC (previously ~20), account age (from buyer stats) in the minutes, and (to top it all off) a welcoming PM from SR Support.<br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />So now I&#039;m out 20 BTC. I PM SR Support (as a reply to the very helpful welcoming PM) and, on the advice of nomadbloodbath in IRC, DPR.<br /><br />A few hours later, I get a reply from SR Support... informing me that my PIN had been reset, and that I would have to wait 5 days before I could change it. This was on my new account, only a few hours old, on which I had never done any sort of PIN activity.<br /><br />&quot;Fuck,&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;This is not normal. There is a serious issue with Silk Road&#039;s database.&quot; I can be quite eloquent in my internal dialogue.<br /><br />So I send off a few strongly worded PMs to SR Support, detailing my evidence. They&#039;ve been read, but have not been responded to. The PM to DPR has yet to be read.<br /><br />Today, there&#039;s more downtime, of a similar sort to the first downtime period yesterday (same error in Tor logs).<br /><br />Analysing the situation further, by my estimate yesterday&#039;s second downtime was just long enough for a user to copy the entire SR database (disabling writes in the meantime to prevent getting a corrupted copy, which explains the session cookie issues), then reload it. If I created my &quot;new&quot; account during the reload, it could easily explain the loss of my account (if the DB restore script prioritized existing rows).<br /><br />So, best-case scenario: SR fucked up server maintenance. Worst-case: SR is compromised by LEO.<br /><br />More information as I collect it.

				So is this what that latest Gawker article was referring to about LE closing in on Silk Road? <br /><br />I would imagine if they could figure out the source of the db corruption, they&#039;d want to roll it back and patch the vulnerability, then force everyone to change passwords or create new accounts if they suspect the db was compromised during that time ... then go through the labor of tracking down bitcoins, a major PITA. <br /><br />I guess we&#039;ll find out.

				actually i do have one interesting story to contribute to this. last night i noticed that i was logged out and forced to log back in which happens from time to time on SR. I normally can stay logged in for a few days before getting bumped. so last night it asked me to login and i know i entered the right captch and it didnt spit out a message saying invalid login it just made me login again but this time the captch was only 3 digits and was all numbers if i recall. i think it was like 357 or something liike that. i entered the odd captcha and it let me in. ive never seen a 3 digit captcha on SR. <br /><br />Perhaps DPR was deploying a new server and we got caught in the time he was setting up the connections to the DB or something. who knows. but just keep your tin foil hats on and SR will be back soon!

I know SR captchas are taken from a wordlist table combined with a random 3-digit number- so a database issue could cause this too.<br /><br />But yeah, I don&#039;t think this was LEO. I&#039;ll keep being suspicious until it can be conclusively shown to be benign... because after all, we&#039;re buying drugs on the internet here.

I normally can stay logged in for a few days before getting bumped. so last night it asked me to login and i know i entered the right captch and it didnt spit out a message saying invalid login it just made me login again but this time the captch was only 3 digits and was all numbers if i recall. i think it was like 357 or something liike that. i entered the odd captcha and it let me in. ive never seen a 3 digit captcha on SR. <br /><br />Perhaps DPR was deploying a new server and we got caught in the time he was setting up the connections to the DB or something. who knows. but just keep your tin foil hats on and SR will be back soon! Enjoy!

Same story here with the boot and subsequent 3 digit captcha. Didn&#039;t log me in with the 3 digit but resumed to normal length right after and let me in.

				I noticed some database weirdness earlier today.&nbsp; One of the pictures that came up on the main page was xtc pills from a vendor called iDesign.&nbsp; IIRC, that guy ended up being a scammer and hasn&#039;t been around for months.&nbsp; When I clicked on the listing it came up as &quot;listing not available&quot; or whatever it usually says.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen other main page weirdness before and it&#039;s never been a big deal, though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve several times had situations where the picture does not match the actual listing when you click on it.&nbsp; So I&#039;m not tripping, at least not at this point.<br /><br />I wonder where limetless is in this thread.&nbsp; Usually he&#039;s got like 3-4 posts in a thread like this.&nbsp; Im thinking he&#039;s sleeping, but based on his post count, I&#039;m not sure he actually sleeps.

				While writing my script today, I also discovered that the captchas are not unique to each session. I can use the same captcha for around 5 minutes to log in and out. This make it easy to initiate brute force attacks.

				I consider myself technical, but no where near as technical as a lot of people here. So I have a question for people better than myself. If LE did somehow take control of SR, how much risk would there actually be for those of us who are taking the precautions we should all be taking anyway? Not saying it has or hasn&#039;t happened here, but hypothetically speaking.<br /><br />As buyers, as long as we&#039;re using PGP when placing orders, and obviously keeping any of our personal information on a need to know basis, what could LE actually do? Same with sellers, as long as they take the normal precautions could LE actually do much to catch them? If I&#039;m missing something obvious please let me know, unless it&#039;s potentially sensitive in some way (no need to give LE ideas they haven&#039;t thought of already...)<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to stop people worrying (paranoia keeps me safe) but I like to be realistic about threats.

				SR is a site like any other, with the same uptime + security issues but the stakes are a lot higher. <br /><br />I suspect LE is only one of DPR&#039;s concerns. There&#039;s a lot of bitcoin here waiting to be stolen if someone technical and without scruples does so. Watch the BTC drop out if / when that happens. <br /><br />Good luck guys. In the meantime, I hope you are all using PGP for your comms! If the DB is compromised, that&#039;s exactly why you&#039;d want to be encrypted. <br /><br />&nbsp;
