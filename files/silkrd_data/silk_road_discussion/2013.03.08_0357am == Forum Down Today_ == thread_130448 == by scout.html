				The forum was down for me from around noon EST until just now&nbsp; ....&nbsp; so almost 12 hours.&nbsp; Was it down for everyone else as well?<br /><br />I am also locked out of my account over on SR itself in spite of only accessing it via Tails, memorized URL, and never entering my PIN.&nbsp; I was successfully logged in until 4am EST, and now I&#039;m locked out.<br /><br />(I&#039;ve contacted support -- nearly 10 hours ago now.)<br /><br />So, tell me, anyone else have problems accessing the forums today?&nbsp; I kept getting a SMF error ...<br />

				I had quite a lot of downtime on the forum too. But i think it started more like 24h ago for me. <br /><br />Got the same SMF error since 18+ hours or something. Some minor issues on SR too but nothing very annoying.<br /><br />scout: You can&#039;t connect to SR or you can&#039;t log in ? If it&#039;s the second then maybe your password somehow got captured by someone ? I don&#039;t want to seem paranoid, but I don&#039;t see why only your accounts would be affected on SR.<br /><br />The real question would be: Which of my passwords are similar and in that case is it coherent to the accounts I can&#039;t access ? It would be quite odd since Tails should be a pretty resilient system and a keylogger would be hard to install...<br /><br />Anyway, good luck !<br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t downloaded anything on this computer, nor anything while using Tails, so that&#039;s why I don&#039;t understand how this could have been a keylogger issue.&nbsp; it is a clean computer from which I only ever boot my Tails liveCD/DVD ... <br /><br />Who knows.&nbsp; Really don&#039;t think it could&#039;ve been a keylogger.
