				A couple of things may be happening,<br />[1] The vendor has removed that listing. For whatever reason.<br />[2] The vendor has gone into stealth mode, this is where only his fans will see his listings. Again there are several reason a vendor does this.<br />[3] The vendor has changed their shipping settings on this item, and no longer ships to your country. You can check this by changing you SETTINGS to location: Undeclared.<br />[4] The vendor hasn&#039;t logged in for over three days (I think it&#039;s three) and Silk Road automatically puts the vendor on &#039;holiday&#039; and takes down their listings, until they log back in again.<br /><br />I may have missed some, but these are the first to come to mind, there may be some more...<br /><br />Oh yea, almost forgot, you could be on the Buyers Blacklist, you definitely wouldn&#039;t see all the listings then. Actually, this does sound like what is happening if more listing keep disappearing (as more vendors hear about you). What did you do? The Buyers Blacklist is quiet rare, but once your on it your fucked. It&#039;s the only time they keep a record of your real name (not your address though) to stop you just opening a new account. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I think it&#039;s the end of the road for you... :(

I have a perfect record. No problems with any vendors, ever. This isn&#039;t a vendor issue. This is an issue related to the site itself.<br /><br />What&#039;s happening is when I log on to silkroadvb5piz3r.onion sometimes NOTHING shows up in the left hand panel. All I&#039;ll be able to see are the items on the front page with the pictures. Meaning I can&#039;t browse the market properly! It comes back after a while but it&#039;s annoying as shit when I&#039;m trying to casually browsing and then POOF every single listing for every single category dissapears only to reappear an hour or some odd time later.<br /><br />It&#039;s like some sort of glitch the road has been having lately. It didn&#039;t start happening until after the 4/20 sale.

				Update your location setting to Undeclared. I notice when I log in sometimes it automatically shows domestic only and has only a handful of listings.

				if you cant see all pictures on front page, then it is your TOR is slow, it just not been loaded completely and server time outed your client. Change TOR ID and reload front page again, should help. <br />But number of listings on declining that is true, for what ever reason.
