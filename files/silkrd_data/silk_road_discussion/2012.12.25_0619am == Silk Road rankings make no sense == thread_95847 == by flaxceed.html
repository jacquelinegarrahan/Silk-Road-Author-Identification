				How can you reconcile these two sets of stats?<br /><br />has been a member for 1 month<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 22% of sellers with 97.8% positive feedback from 112 transactions<br />has 41 fans<br /><br /><br />has been a member for 8 months<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 27% of sellers with 99.6% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions<br />has 206 fans<br /><br />The top one is drugformulas, the second one is me- flaxceed.&nbsp; I have been a member for 8 months- df for one month.&nbsp; I have 206 fans, he/she has 41.&nbsp; I have 99.6% positive feedback and they have 97.8%.&nbsp; How in the ever-living FUCK do they rank ahead of me with top 22%?<br /><br />Many things baffle me here on Silk Road, but this takes the cake.&nbsp; But while I am ranting, can anyone tell me how to gain access to the vendor&#039;s forum?&nbsp;

				Hmm that is really odd.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is there is a time per transaction faster in there where he may be filling 3 orders a day to your 1.&nbsp; or whatever

				Look for instance at this vendor<br /><br />has been a member for 7 months<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 82% of sellers with 100% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions<br />has 298 fans - become a fan<br /><br />100% from more than 300 but only top 82%

				PM inigo to get on the vendor forum. He may be able to shed some more light on the ranking thing as well - does seem strange. Please post any more information about that - am curious...

				armyofdarkness already said it. It is based on value. The number one seller is going to be the be the guy who moves the most money. <br /><br />has been a member for 7 months<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 3% of sellers with 99.8% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions<br /><br />That guy? He is the guy with the top-selling item of all the listed drugs.<br /><br />has been a member for 9 months<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 1% of sellers with 87.7% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions<br /><br />That guy? Yeah, his feedback is not great... supertrips is number 1. He who moves the most money shall earn the highest ranking.<br /><br />Is that the detail you wanted? In addition, the feedback ranking is also based on value. $1000 with 3/5 causes a much larger change then $50 with a 1/5.

				Very interesting.&nbsp; So the ranking represents how valuable you are to the site, but not your ability to provide good customer service.&nbsp; I won&#039;t worry about it then!!!&nbsp; I guess as long as buyers know this then the stats can be valuable.
