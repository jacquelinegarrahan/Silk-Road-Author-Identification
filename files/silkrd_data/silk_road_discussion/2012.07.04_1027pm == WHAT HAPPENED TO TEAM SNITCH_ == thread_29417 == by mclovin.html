				I am the user poiZEN from the main site. &quot;Team Snitch&quot; posted part of an address I used on this item:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/556a8af920<br /><br />I used the address only once, so it&#039;s pretty clear that it came from that purchase. I think that the<br />account The Godfather has either been set up to specifically amass positive feedback by demanding<br />FE on minimum amounts of BTC and then harvesting the addresses, or that he uses a weak password<br />and somebody else copied the addresses in his sales.<br /><br />Either way, I&#039;d advise anybody to avoid that vendor.

				It is almost certain that he is the source of the addresses, but he could have had his account hacked by somebody else. Judging by his non-existant reputation (all of his 5/5 ratings are FE on lotteries) and posting fake pictures on his weed offers, I suspect the account was created only to harvest addresses and ransom the users.

I&#039;m very glad I never did any biz with him. That Malwai seemed priced too low to be real, and F/E only? He must&#039;ve got 1-2k off morons F/E&#039;ing for oz&#039;s weed they will never see. <br /><br />Quite a bit of scammers lately, eh? Seems a lot focus on using old shill feedback/samples lately to scam people out of larger orders, almost always out of escrow.<br />

Innocent until proven guilty does not work in these kind of situations. If the admins of the road banned you there must have been some strong evidence. Only you can prove them wrong.<br /><br />On a side note, why do we allow lotteries? It seems like lotteries and btc vending are the two easiest ways to build up reputation for scammers. At least put the lottery and btc vending orders on a different rating system.

Someone would have needed access to your private key an password. If you were hacked or scammed out of those then you are a dumb ass As nomad pointed out YOU are the common link. It would be hard to explain this away but you can start now. I only hope that you have enough in your account to cover the weed deals that may or MAY NOT be shipped out to customers.

				I suspect, &quot;My account was hacked&quot; is a common excuse for other shit. But if an account actually *is* hacked, it could be anything from social engineering (tricking the user into just giving your their password), getting them to go to a site that looks just like the SR login page, and then capturing their credentials when they try to log in, or an actual hack on the server of some sort.<br /><br />Check out Avast free edition for Mac. Macs aren&#039;t really prone to viruses anyway (although they do exist), but that&#039;s a well reviewed, frequently updates, and free! anti-virus software

				i think the most likely method of most SR accounts being hacked is by people buying those &quot;secure usb vm&#039;s&quot; and the like for sale on SR itself.&nbsp; i&#039;ve said for a while now that those should be allowed.&nbsp; i&#039;ve actually just kind of been waiting to see how long it would take for a&nbsp; group of people get hacked though those, and what the results would be :-/<br /><br />scammers/btc thieves are bad, but what if your bought your &quot;secure setup&quot; from LEO?&nbsp; ESPECIALLY if you&#039;re a vendor? hell, it could take down a huge chunk of silk road if it happened to be a popular vendor and they just waited and collected addresses and evidence.<br /><br />sooooo.... maybe SR should finally stop allowing listings for these?&nbsp; and lotteries like the godfather&#039;s (where no one ever won by the way)

				I was *this* close from ordering cigarettes from this guy &quot;TheGodFather&quot;,<br />but I dunno, I always had a bad feeling about him.<br /><br />He was expanding too much too fast. Cigs, weed, lotto, BTC, graphic designs!! etc etc.. <br />Something was fishy. <br /><br />He always seemed to me like one of those lowlifes on the street who would open his rain jackets and tries to sell you fake Rolex and pirated DVDs.<br /><br />And he was almost &quot;too organized&quot; on his profile page. Not to mention those 100+ &quot;FE&quot; feedback msgs.<br /><br />Thank God I came to my senses.<br /><br />What an asshole he is. Fuck you if you&#039;re reading this, bitch.
