				When I look through vendor feedback on SR I notice that it is almost universally either a 5/5 or 1/5.&nbsp; Even the most trusted vendors on this site have some 1/5 feedback scores, from what I assume are disgruntled customers who probably made the mistake leading to their package not arriving/getting caught/dog eating pills/whatever.<br /><br />This poses a problem for some of the newer vendors who may not have a large enough sample size to &quot;take the hit&quot; from potentially incorrect negative feedback.<br /><br />My idea is to require any feedback below 3/5 to fill in an additional field, &quot;contraindication&quot; whereby at least 1 potential reason is given for the vendor not being at fault.&nbsp; Then, all a customer has to do is look at the contraindications to get an idea of whether the negative feedback to a vendor is warranted or not.&nbsp; Stupid comments in this field, i.e. &quot;hes a dick&quot; will generally be indicative of lazy customers blaming vendors for their own failings, and are therefore still useful.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I think this is just an unfortunate side effect of anonymity. The problem I see with allowing vendors to respond to negative feedback, is that instead of promoting rationality, it may result in a further breakdown of logical argument, i.e. flame wars between vendor and buyer.&nbsp; By forcing the buyer to point out ways he could possibly be wrong in his feedback, I think its more likely that negative feedback will be given for the &quot;right&quot; reasons in the first place.<br />In other words, I think a proactive solution will be more effective than a reactive one.
