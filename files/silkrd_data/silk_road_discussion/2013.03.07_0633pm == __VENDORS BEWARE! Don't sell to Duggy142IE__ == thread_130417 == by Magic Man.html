				Just a friendly warning to all you vendors out there. Last month I sold an oz to a buyer over in Europe. Long story short the parcel still has not yet arrived so he is accusing me of not shipping the package even after showing the receipt I had in my car since Feb 8. I offered to reship him some weed even though in my terms I say I do not because of my already low prices, but that he&#039;s need to adjust his feedback. Because of this lying prick my 100% feedback has now dropped to 90%. He was not able to provide any sort of customs letter so how do I know that he didn&#039;t smoke it all and is just trying to get a reship or partial refund? Watch out for this scumbag, I&#039;d hate to see anymore honest sellers be dragged down like I have been.<br /><br />Does anyone know if the mods can take some sort of action?

				What sort of stats does this guy have? I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m entirely happy with you slating a buyer on the forums that is potentially a genuine case, have you got any concrete evidence that he has tried to scam you?<br /><br />This is not really the right attitude to have, if every one done this there would be chaos, no one would trust any one!<br /><br />Any way try and work something out before slating some one&#039;s name next time is all Im saying....:)

				Yea I hear what your saying however he&#039;s already wrecked my feedback rating.. As far as proof well I uploaded the receipt carbon copy for him. I have never lost a package yet and for some reason I dont know if I can believe that this one is &quot;missing&quot;.<br />Maybe I&#039;ll post our whole chat so people can see whats going on. Its just odd I dont hear from him at all then 8 days ago he must have messaged me a dozen times, to me that looks like someone who smoked all their stash and is feening for more lol.<br />If he left like a 3/5 or a 4/5 I&#039;d want to work with him and see how we can get that to a 5/5. But when someone rates you 1/5 thats major disrespect and as far as im concerned he can go to hell.

				Does the receipt have the address on it?&nbsp; Also, mods can do nothing about anything.&nbsp; They moderate the forums, and that&#039;s all.

				Yea it has the ship from and to address, name, and the date so I can&#039;t post it publicly. Maybe I am over reacting just a little because im pissed off, I worked pretty hard maintaining that 100% feedback by timely shipping, supplying good product and communication and in the split of a second someone can wreck your name.

				And yet it can all go back to 100 as soon as this guy decides you did right by him and changes his feedback, at which point obviously you&#039;ll never sell to him again.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s stop and consider what you&#039;ve told us:<br /><br />1) you&#039;d rather blacklist him publicly on the forums than work it out with him.<br />2) you violated the terms of the site, by...<br />3) ... keeping his address in your fucking car for a week.&nbsp; What if you got pinched?&nbsp; C&#039;mon man.<br /><br />Delete this thread.&nbsp; It does you more harm than him.<br />

				I keep all receipts of &quot;in transit&quot; orders so I can prove my side of the story when I have to deal with assholes like this one. once received I burn all receipts. I&#039;ve tried working with the seller by offering to reship but after he pulled that feedback stunt of 1/5 I&#039;m not doing jack shit for him anymore.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep this thread open as a warning to all the other vendors out there so they know what they are in for when dealing with this guy. Thanks.

				We are going through the same thing with a customer.&nbsp; Only that our shipment was a domestic one.&nbsp; Some people just take advantage of escrow.&nbsp;
