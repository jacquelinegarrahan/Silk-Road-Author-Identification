				I am new but still, I got no message explaining why my order got cancelled. I am very disappointed and feel it is not in the interest of the consumer to practice &quot;no explanation&quot; cancellations. I wasted my time and energy placing the order and now I have to do this all over again Ruined my plans for partying as well. Not happy at all about this. What the hell??

				Of course I will chose a different vendor and move on. And yes, I still love this site. Still, I don&#039;t understand the lack of explanation.

				Have you checked their vendor page?&nbsp; Did you live up to all of the requirements?&nbsp; If so, and they still canceled, fuck em.

				I did use PGP and follow direction, and now I have ordered with others. I guess the original vendor didn&#039;t want my business. All I am saying a short note explaining why cancel is helpful in this community. I don&#039;t think I did anything wrong and now I will never know if I did. Oh well...

				Was it at my vendor page? <br />I accidentally cancelled two orders instead of cancelling one from a request from the customer, and accidentally cancelled the other order.<br />Since I didn&#039;t have the customers username I could not send a PM.<br />A letter is underway though.<br /><br />If it was you, please let me know so I can send out the package that is already totally waiting to be send&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Otherwise, I dunno. Sucks. If it happens again, PM the vendor and ask for an explanation. Perhaps it was accidental.<br /><br />Take care.

				Virmo, it was not you. Anyway, I sent an email and PM and nothing. I think the vendor is busy but he has no rule of FE or brand new buyers, so... Moved on.

				Aw, too bad for both you and me. It was a great order!<br /><br />Anyways, there are a lot of vendors out here so I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find something good somewhere else (which you probably already did).<br /><br />Cheers
