				I had a strong suspicion that this vendor was the same person who used to vend as &quot;The Boss&quot; and after searching the forums I found the following: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">People watch your step, this idiot has a history as Lupen , BuldogTvB , Buldogistheboss , The Boss , Italy and probably many more names.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Big orders will be refunded with 50% of your own money, until he has enough F.E. and will disappear again and start all over again, and again, and again, and again.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I can confirm that Buldog had his account banned for blackmailing a customer and releasing personal info, he&#039;s been going through multiple seller accounts and I think his latest is &quot;buldogistheboss&quot; or something to that effect, though this Italy vendor reeks of him.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d suggest anyone to steer clear of this vendor. ::)

				I guess i should update my last post about this vendor.. <br /><br />I&nbsp; wanted to test his H, and asked him to set up a sale sample and he did for .5 and only charged me 3 fucking bucks.. then when he wnted me to pay all kinda crazy money to ship it and sign i said N/M so by this time he asked for my address and i look in my mail today and there it is, <br /><br />.5 of some brown H, looks just like his stuff on the page, Not any strength to it at all but im surprised it came.. Stealth was decent, i realized what it was when i saw the country but the envelop looked like business mail..<br /><br />so needless to say he&#039;s not much on the English language it seems cause i wrote him cussing him out about a issue and he never once even told me he sent it.
