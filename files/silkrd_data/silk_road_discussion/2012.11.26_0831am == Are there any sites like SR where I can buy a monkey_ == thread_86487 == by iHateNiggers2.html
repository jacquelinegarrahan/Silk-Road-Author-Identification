				Yes, you can buy monkey on clearweb but they are extremely difficult to rise. You can&#039;t keep a monkey in your apartment unless you like living in a shithole. I would love one but will definetly break everything in my house and don&#039;t lock it in your bathroom because you don&#039;t like prison either. Buy a dog

				There was an interesting/funny thread in the product request page which is similar to this one, about 8 months ago, some bloke wanted a monkey, like you, delivered to them, he made a contact but didn&#039;t update with result.<br /><br />The thread got very funny when they discussed delivery options.<br />

I was think you would have to either dress him up in order to attempt to disguise the fact he is indeed a monkey, or alternatively get some MJ Juice (Propofol was it?) and pass him off as dead. Both a little sucky for the monkey.

				OMG :0<br /><br /><br />I would actually love if this could be thought about seriously. I don&#039;t think our exotic animal trade would be quite like the way that trade has developed elsewhere.. I do have faith that this community would regulate itself and get to a place where animal welfare was a priority.<br /><br />oh, I can dream... I love animals, and I wholly believe in animal welfare, but animal rights is absurd to me.

				I&#039;ve got a one-eyed chimpanzee who wears people clothes that I use to have knife fights with other monkeys. He&#039;s Furious George. I&#039;ll sell him for 100 BTC but if you piss these guys off they are literally strong enough to rip your genitals and limbs from your body, so you better treat him nicely.
