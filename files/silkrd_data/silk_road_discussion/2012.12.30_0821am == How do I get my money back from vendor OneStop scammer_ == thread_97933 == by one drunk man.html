As the previous post states, once you FE, Silk Road Support WILL NOT help you.Your only chance was if the vendor returned the money to you but that won&#039;t be happening from the looks of things. Sorry to say this, but put it down to an expensive lesson and from now on, never FINALIZE EARLY for any vendor! Vendors mainly scam buyers by having them FE. If buyers refuse to do so, they won&#039;t lose their coins as they will still be in Escrow.

EMS ships them, just like PureO uses DHL. Still doesn&#039;t say where they are coming from. Idiot. And because we are leaving and not selling anymore makes us a scammer? You&#039;re an even bigger idiot than anyone can realize! I scam nobody! People already we&#039;re being compensated for their STUCK packages!

				Holy fuck!! That&#039;s one delusional, psychotic prick who will be sorry for what they&#039;ve done. Arrogant, cocky dickheads like that bloke eventually fall foul of the law. They are so wrapped up in themselves that they fail to pay attention to their surroundings and make crucial mistakes. This is a perfect example of why you should never trust anyone here, regardless of who they are and&nbsp; how long they have been here for. And buyers please note, there is no such thing as a &quot;trusted vendor&quot;, despite what you may think.

				That&#039;s how it goes sometimes. 100% escrow to 100% FE. Exit strategy clue. Especially when they require everybody FE even their regulars. <br /><br />Tho scammers don&#039;t talk about they shipped out all orders. And the feedback for the FE&#039;s I looked the other day most people got their stuff. Not everyone updated but a lot did. Best you could say maybe, some got selective scammed. Gotta wait and see if packs actually get delivered. <br /><br />Saerch on this forum is shit but I been checking the whole weekend looking for complaints. One this mofo (OP) has been spamming the forum crying about something he already knows the answer to. Considering the min order was 100, this ain&#039;t the OP&#039;s first rodeo. rings like a shill for the competition to me. Same fucking post in rumor mill, product offers, and now here. That&#039;s noob shit. And Onestop made a point out of turning&nbsp; saying they turn away noobs. I was like damn. Most just make noob FE. <br /><br />Whatever the fuck. <br /><br />Tell you what tho, Benjesit better report back that he got something. If that guy don&#039;t get nothing, ain&#039;t nobody getting jack shit. <br /><br />

				Damn, y&#039;all must not do any H. All them H vendors think of H buyers as junkies. Meth sellers are worse sometimes too. <br /><br />But you know what tho, you&#039;re both right (kitkat and wadozo). It&#039;s good to treat them right and good to be treated right. Takes little to no effort to be cool. Both ways. <br /><br />I miss the old school vendor scammer though. Those motherfuckers you could see coming.

You certainly didn&#039;t meet the requirements for the listing you tried to order so you had to be screened. Simple procedure to test you. Your line on the blacklist specifically says &quot;low stats, didn&#039;t contact first&quot;<br /><br />Now when the listing specifically says if you have below such and such purchasing stats you must contact onestop prior to ordering. well... that&#039;s what you must do. Not order first and never message. It&#039;s to screen customers and you never followed the procedure so your ass got canceled.Plain and simple. Onestop took great caution with people he dealt with, and for very good reason! Obvious reasons. People like you fail to read the entire listing and well that&#039;s just highschool teaching lesson to follow directions.<br /><br />Onestop turned away over half the people who wanted to order from them because of the simple fact buyers can&#039;t follow directions. Just ask RxKing how many people really never read the entire listing or follow procedures! I guarantee you&#039;ll get a mouth full from him. Same goes with onestop. If you can&#039;t even follow a screening procedure because you don&#039;t qualify to order because you fail to read that just makes you look bad and any prudent vendor would turn you away in a heartbeat.<br /><br />JezuzWazaMushroom: Onestop never sold weed - ever! You have them mixed up with the other vendor with a similar name I bet. But I&#039;m sure onestop appreciates your kind words :-D<br /><br />one drunk idiot: What username did you order with? Onestop will refund you. All you have to do is say which username you ordered with and onestop will verify in his notes if you really ordered international or not. Otherwise you have no credibility. SR Admins will be more than happy to verify you indeed ordered or did not order. Let&#039;s have it :-D your username that is!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My comments are about 1StopOz and if it&#039;s not them we&#039;re discussing here then I apologize.... <br /><br />It was still shitty weed though! lol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not sure WHERE this quote came from...but like I said.&nbsp; I am HAPPY my order was cancelled.&nbsp; THAT was NOT the issue.<br /><br />The issue was the arrogant, condescending message that you sent me Onestop.&nbsp; No my stats were NOT low when I ordered.&nbsp; They just weren&#039;t high enough for you since you have a God complex.&nbsp; I had about 35 perfect transactions and around $2,000 spent.&nbsp; Not low.<br /><br />No, I am GLAD you cancelled my order.&nbsp; &nbsp;I took issue with the rude message, not the fact that you cancelled my order.&nbsp; I understood why it was cancelled, but it was no reason to be nasty.&nbsp; I just thought I would buy a 50 pack from you since they had good reviews and I like to test new vendors.&nbsp; Yes, YOU were still new in my book, less than 5 month vending!. So I made a mistake and didn&#039;t read the instructions fully.&nbsp; I was in a hurry to put in the order since this was around the time SR was having issues.&nbsp; Does that give you the right to be a douche bag prick?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; So yeah, I only brought this up since you left such ridiculous messages all over the road are no longer vending.&nbsp; If you were still vending i would never have posted this info, I don&#039;t want to damage a vendors rep for no reason.<br /><br />&nbsp; But I had no idea you were so damn vengeful and self righteous that you trolled the forums after &quot;quitting&quot; SR.&nbsp; Dude, WTF?<br /><br />What is hilarious is that YOU seem to have issues with reading comprehension.&nbsp; You just can&#039;t manage to fathom didn&#039;t that my issue was not with my order being cancelled, it was with the arrogant message that you sent to me when you canceled.&nbsp; No call for that dude.&nbsp; You could have just cancelled and I would have understood.&nbsp; Or said &quot;Sorry but we had to cancel, you did not follow our protocol.&nbsp; I hope you can find a different vendor to order from&quot; <br />You know, I realized shortly after placing the order that I had made a mistake.&nbsp; BUT I have a life outside SR and don&#039;t have time to spend all day online sending messages to vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;But of course, you are an egomaniac, you can&#039;t help but be a jerk.<br />Good riddance to nasty people.

Read some more of my posts and come back and see if that silly shit fits. I was looking for a good opi vendor. Noticed some similarities among vendors. I see your post crying about something but I didn&#039;t see anyone elses. Combed over Onestop&#039;s, and Southstar&#039;s feedback. Southstar didn&#039;t have any. Onestop&#039;s had a bunch of people who FE&#039;d and reported receiving. <br /><br />But for me, Onestop&#039;s FE policy was a deal breaker. Then he switches back to escrow. I was about order, then next day I see this guy blow up on you and take off. Good thing I didn&#039;t order right? I&#039;d have to wait like 2 weeks to get my money back from SR in escrow unless onestop gave it back right away and cancelled my order. But that blow up? That made NO sense. All over one customer? Trippin&#039;. If it were a bunch of customers complaining, yeah. I could see a vendor blow up like that meth vendor last year. Only thing that would make sense is that you&#039;re a shill, son. Shill for southstar. Not PureO though. Wouldn&#039;t really add up for them. But southstar is perfect fit for you. <br /><br />Oh yeah, playa, good luck finding a post where I defend onestop. <br /><br />

A vendor accused of scamming wrote a fuck you letter to his customers and left and you are &quot;pretending&quot; to be angry that you didn&#039;t get the chance to place an order with him. Comeon man you think we are buying that shit?<br /><br />You have amassed 28 post in 2 1/2 days all dealing with Onestop in one way or another and accusing anyone who says anything negative about Onestop of being&nbsp; a vendor or scammer in disguise. <br />Hey man get real, I won&#039;t give you my ordering screenname because you are a evil dude.&nbsp; Kitkat82 must be vendor vicodin or pure o because he also knows onestop is an asshole.<br /><br />Why would mojoiren stick up for a vendor who called all of his customers junkies who want to suck his cock?<br /><br />Fuck you Onestop.&nbsp; I have contacted vendor support on you. You admitted you were not giving any of us our money back, or were you too fucked up on those Chinese percocets to realize that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL. Read some more of my posts and come back and see if that silly shit fits. I was looking for a good opi vendor. Noticed some similarities among vendors. I see your post crying about something but I didn&#039;t see anyone elses. Combed over Onestop&#039;s, and Southstar&#039;s feedback. Southstar didn&#039;t have any. Onestop&#039;s had a bunch of people who FE&#039;d and reported receiving. <br /><br />But for me, Onestop&#039;s FE policy was a deal breaker. Then he switches back to escrow. I was about order, then next day I see this guy blow up on you and take off. Good thing I didn&#039;t order right? I&#039;d have to wait like 2 weeks to get my money back from SR in escrow unless onestop gave it back right away and cancelled my order. But that blow up? That made NO sense. All over one customer? Trippin&#039;. If it were a bunch of customers complaining, yeah. I could see a vendor blow up like that meth vendor last year. Only thing that would make sense is that you&#039;re a shill, son. Shill for southstar. Not PureO though. Wouldn&#039;t really add up for them. But southstar is perfect fit for you. <br /><br />Oh yeah, playa, good luck finding a post where I defend onestop.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yo brotha yo be trippin, yo changed color since yesterdays posts?&nbsp; Today yo are all street throwing around words like nigg, playa. If someone reads your earlier posts that can see you contridicting yo sef, word yo.<br /><br />Onestop you are a lying fuck. <br />You say are filthy rich but now you live on the sr forum jerking your little pecker off everytime someone mentions your name because you are all fucked up on your stash and you can&#039;t hack it. I really feel sorry for you. Even if you get a new account I won&#039;t let a scammer like you sleep. Bullshit you threw away the passcode, you are just waiting for your posts to get deleted. Victims here have long memories of scumbag like you.<br />

Look at how you approach things. <br /><br />Let&#039;s think about a few things to get a proper perspective. <br /><br />1. I ordered a few times before from him. This was when it was all US/US shipping and in escrow. Never had a problem and we talked about old school things when he was a buyer before becoming a seller. Always treated me like a friend and I him. Should I be ashamed of that? I was one of his first customers. I even made a review thread for him which he later thanked me for with extra product. A few vendors have done the same for me or have given freebies in exhange for a review. Am I to be ashamed for that? And you know what, two of those vendors went on to flak out later because they couldn&#039;t handle the business. Am I to be blamed for that too?<br /><br />2. In December when it came time to resupply my goodie bag, I went first to OneStop. Everything looked good - same as before. So I went out and got some BTC in the account. The next day when I was ready to order, everything changed. It was International, expressmail, early finalize only. I was taken back. So we messaged back and forth. I asked if he had anything on hand or when he would be getting anything in so I could avoid the international route. I don&#039;t like signing for packages really. He said no, he&#039;s all out of stock because of the previous Thanksgiving sale. So I thought about it and relented to do FE. I let him know it was my first FE on SR ever. He was surprised by that. Thought a buyer with my stats would have done it at least once. <br /><br />3. Fast forward to two weeks later. Yep, I was worried about the delay. I had planned for a certain amount of days to spread out what I had and expected this to arrive to replenish it. I contacted him and he tried to figure out what the delay was. He was getting worried because no one had received it yet and I was the first to order. So he sent me out a 20pc overnight, free of charge to hold me over. <br /><br />4. Another week and a half passes and still status of package unchanged since dec 6. Of course I was worried. contacted him and he made me a few offers since he already started selling US/US again. If thought maybe I might give it a few days but it was getting overlong. So we negotiated a bit and we both realized that something is up. I offered for him to send me my order from what he had in stock and that I would pay for the overseas one if it ever arrived. Know what he said? Don&#039;t worry about it. And he sent me my order out of his stock. And said that if the overseas one came, it&#039;s free don&#039;t worry about paying. Know what tracking says now? &quot;Origin post is preparing shipment.&quot; <br /><br />In all that time, he never lost his cool, never said anything demeaning, nor was curt. he could have been because there were a few days that I messaged him several times as new ideas came to mind and to bother him for tracking number to the domestic package. But he never came undone with me. <br /><br />What do you expect me to do? Call him a scammer when he never scammed me, ever? Call him a bad guy and ignore the good things he has done for me? He even said that some would be getting theirs soon but mine, being one of the earliest, must have had something go wrong. It&#039;s USPS after all. I had suggested to him to maybe use DHL going forward. He said he&#039;d take it up with his supplier. <br /><br />How is that selling my soul out? <br /><br />Is his feedback, fake? Bad vendors feedback starts dropping before the vendor leaves. I&#039;ve been around long enough to see it. There was certainly enough time for it to drop off considerably. Into the 70% or lower like most other vendors when things go wrong. The only exception is the FE super sale scams. But with those you get lots of complaints. Remember Tony76? There was thread after thread of complaints. <br /><br />You have to have guessed that other buyers contacted him about their late packages. The question is, where are their posts or threads? Maybe he worked things out with some of them, like he did me? Maybe their tracking is showing movement?<br /><br />You have to learn to be reasonable. You catch more flies with honey. <br /><br />And no, he didn&#039;t call me a junkie or a cocksucker. If that&#039;s what you interpret, then that&#039;s your view. <br /><br />And no vendor will shun me because I&#039;ve done nothing wrong and I&#039;m the customer vendors want. Always reasonable, flexible, friendly and finalize on delivery day. They might be drug dealers, but they are people too. Remember that and things will go well. Be careful how you word things because without seeing your facial expressions, words can take on different meanings that you intend. <br /><br />Still after nearly 100 transactions and a year on the road, I haven&#039;t lost a penny. Even in situations where I could have. Only had to use resolution twice. Once the seller refunded right away as soon as he saw it was in resolution and the other time the vendor skipped out and SR had to do it (escrow). <br /><br />I wish things could be different for you. I do. Nobody likes to see someone lose money and trust. But you have to be smart about things. Leave the ego behind sometimes. I&#039;ve escaped a few scams because I appealed to the humanity of the person. Not insincerely, but with genuine sincerity because I recognize the human in them that is also in me.&nbsp;

				This thread is giving me a headache.&nbsp; I have to side with benJesuit on this.&nbsp; I am not seeing any threads with people complaining about being ripped off.&nbsp; So this leads me to conclude that there is not really a &quot;scam&quot; going on here.&nbsp; &nbsp;It sounds more like a vendor who had enough of dealing with people since they obviously had a very short temper and no tolerance for anyone who isn&#039;t a total kiss ass.&nbsp; Not really the same as a vendor who sets out to rob people blind.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care for One Stops attitude, but he is not showing himself to be a scammer, just a guy with no tolerance for mistakes, no patience and limited people skills.&nbsp; Looks like the orders are coming in and people are not flooding the threads to complain about being ripped off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I agree you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.&nbsp; This goes for buyers as well as vendors.&nbsp; I have never once been scammed, and have always stayed calm and very courteous with vendors.&nbsp; Everything always works out just fine.&nbsp; Packages get delayed, vendors will sometimes forget what day they shipped, they get busy, it happens.&nbsp; Patience is the name of the game here.&nbsp; As long as you are considerate and patient, don&#039;t start messaging the vendor before it has been &quot;in transit&quot; for more than 11 days then you should be able to work things out like an adult.<br /><br />The kiss of death is going to the forums with anything you wish to resolve with a vendor.&nbsp; One should&nbsp; never do that, it ought to be used only as a last resort.

				Have gone back and forth on whether to bother jumping in on this situation, but at the end of the day my story with OneStop is pretty much on par with Ben.<br /><br />I had nothing but flawless transactions and good communication. The vendor was never anything but professional and we enjoyed many deals together. Even when SR went down, we continued to do business as if nothing ever happened.&nbsp; He messaged me a week before whatever happened and told me he was going to close up soon and he would set aside whatever I wanted. Unfortunately, he left before I could get that last order in.<br /><br />I believe something fishy is going on here, but at the end of the day - I&#039;ll still be looking for a vendor to do real business with.

				I totally agree with Ben&#039;s approach, and i totally agree with KitKat about the attitude.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a while back now, but i have had one order with OneStop.&nbsp; I ordered a small package.&nbsp; He questioned me about the address because it was slightly different than normal.&nbsp; I assured him it was fine and i had multiple packages delivered there.&nbsp; So he ships.&nbsp; The postman put my package in another box at the mailbox wall because the front office was closed on the day he delivered.&nbsp; The postman then took the next two business days off without telling his replacements where he put my package.&nbsp; I checked in with OneStop to see what the tracking said on his end.&nbsp; He called the post office and they said my address was screwed up (i have no idea why they said this because the postman had delivered it and put it in this other box because the office was closed).&nbsp; Anyway, when OneStop heard that he absolutely lost his shit on me in about 3 PM&#039;s on the road.&nbsp; I kept my cool, told him i would be patient, and i had no intention of going to resolution on it.&nbsp; Once he realized i wasn&#039;t scamming he cancelled the order which gave me all my coins back.&nbsp; I hooked up with the normal post man 3 days later and got my package.&nbsp; I then got on the road and sent OneStop the coins he had given back.&nbsp; It was almost like i was PM&#039;ing with two different people.&nbsp; One guy was a total ass that lost his temper, and the other guy was very understanding and refunded my coins when he didn&#039;t have to.

				Did anyone else get their orders besides BenJ?<br /><br />Or are their orders still out in the wild between China and America? It was shipped out of Chins right?<br /><br />Customs hang up? Or is the tracking useless for those who got tracking?<br /><br />What&#039;s up? Just want to know if anyone got scammed or got their stuff?<br /><br />SouthStar ain&#039;t doing no business either.

				No, that other package of mine, the one I was compensated for, is still in postal limbo. Says, &quot;Origin Post is Preparing Shipment&quot; It&#039;s been that way for weeks now. That order was placed early december.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll get a love letter from customs or one day the package will show up.
