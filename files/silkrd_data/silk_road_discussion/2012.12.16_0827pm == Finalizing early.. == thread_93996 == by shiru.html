				That means it&#039;s waiting for the vendor to mark it as &quot;shipped.&quot;&nbsp; Then it will say &quot;in transit,&quot; or whatever, and allow you to finalize.<br /><br />There&#039;s an exception: if the vendor is new, it won&#039;t let you finalize for I think a full 36 hours.&nbsp; Not sure.&nbsp; But be careful with finalizing early.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually a very bad idea unless you&#039;ve done a lot of research about the vendor here on the forum.&nbsp; The feedback system is shit, never trust it -- it&#039;s a useful guide to know whether or not researching a vendor on the forum is worth the time or not though (if there&#039;s a bad feedback score, don&#039;t bother researching, just pass)

				Yes what Flush said, also i suggest making a few purchases of ebooks or porn, just to get your buyer stats to where you wont HAVE to FE. Good luck friend<br />

				In my opinion, I think if someone offers a &quot;legal&quot; product / service on SR, where to possibility of not recieving the package equals zero, FE should be allowed. In addition to that, every vendor that requires FE must declare it on his listing and his vendor&#039;s profile page.<br /><br />In the end, it&#039;s the user&#039;s choice if he wants to buy a product or use a service where FE is a necessity.

I managed to go from 0 to my current 24 completed transaction total without ever needing to FE or jump through any hoops to build my stats. I just did the basic research necessary to find vendors who were selling what I actually wanted and who also didn&#039;t require FE (even for a buyer with 0 stats). It&#039;s very easy to do, so people getting themselves ripped off by FE&#039;ing really have no one to blame but themselves.

				Add us to the list of vendors who support the anti-FE movement. We buy our bricks, we put tens of thousands of dollars of our own money on the line.<br /><br />We did our research and learned that part of being a successful business is maintaining a rainy day fund to cover eventualities like postal strikes, major consumer fraud, and auto-finalizers,<br /><br />New businesses like us feel the most pressure from the immediate lack of cash flow.&nbsp; The overhead costs of starting up in our field are huge, so our lesson learned is to have the funds on hand after product purchase to cover about 1.5:1 reserves to purchases.<br /><br />If your vendor can&#039;t carry your $200 purchase for the two weeks it takes for&nbsp; you to receive, the fundamental foundation of their business should be questioned.<br /><br />We trust, until you give us a reason not to.<br />SRX

Now by MIM do you mean MIMM( marijuana is my muse) or MMM, or another vendor entirely?
