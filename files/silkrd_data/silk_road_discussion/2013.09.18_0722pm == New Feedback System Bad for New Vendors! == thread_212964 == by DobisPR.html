				Hi Everyone,<br />I&#039;m not here to bash the feedback overhaul. I think it is a major improvement from the last system. However, I think a few tweaks are necessary.<br /><br />Firstly, having buyers have the &quot;option&quot; to leave written feedback, or give it later, is very misleading. As a new vendor myself I gave out 8 samples and only received 6 written reviews. I thought at first that the two people that didn&#039;t leave reviews did it intentionally, but then I realized on my buyer account that I had left a 5/5 feedback with no written review for an order I had placed about a month ago when the system was first overhauled! The only reason I realized this is because the vendor sent me a message asking me to place a review and I told him I already did! I had no idea there was a &quot;Pending reviews&quot; link on my account page.<br /><br />I believe written reviews are very important, especially for new vendors. Even though the buyers leave a 5/5 rating, the written feedback shows how many people actually bought the product. The customer that was my first &quot;actual&quot; customer finalized and gave a 5/5 but left no feedback and I believe that has negatively impacted me as a new vendor.

				Before the update, we had the option to finalize and wait and give a review/rating later. Since the update we have the option to finalize and wait and give a review/rating later. Don&#039;t really see the change. <br /><br />Also, it&#039;s getting kind of silly how many times I am seeing how hard it is to figure out how to review an order. When you finalize the following comes up:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Leave rating<br /><br />* DO NOT leave a rating if you are still waiting on your order!<br />** All ratings are final. Do not leave a rating expecting to change it later. Make every attempt you can to resolve problems with your vendor before rating.<br />*** Click here for more information.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you elect to rate the order, the next page that loads says this:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Rating submitted! Click here to write a review for your transaction.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I really do not see how it could be any clearer?<br /><br />If you elect to not leave a review, you can always do it later by visiting the vendors homepage, or your account. This is all covered in the wiki as well:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Ratings_%26_Reviews<br />

				Not an issue to worry about. If you got all 5/5s, that&#039;s all that matters. The written reviews aren&#039;t as relevant as you might think. <br /><br />Be glad they didn&#039;t give you 4/5s as is suggested as &quot;normal&quot; by the explanation on the feedback rating page.

				I for one would trust a listing that has multiple reviews on it rather than no reviews regardless of the vendor&#039;s rating. Yea 5/5 will make the vendor&#039;s overall reputation better, but written reviews give more detail to the product from a third party, and as a new vendor, this is very important to gaining trust with customers.<br /><br />plainsman1963,<br />Maybe not everyone is as observant as you are, but after I placed a 5/5 rating, I was under the impression that I already gave a review, I read &quot;Rating submitted!&quot; too quickly and I blindly moved to another page and had no idea of a &quot;pending reviews&quot; page. That was my mistake. All I was saying is I think it is a little misleading and I can see other people making the same mistake as I made.
