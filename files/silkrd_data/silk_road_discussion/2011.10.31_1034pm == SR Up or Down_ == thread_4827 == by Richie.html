				Hey everyone!<br /><br />Normally I&#039;d just wait and see if SR would load for me for a few hours before asking this, but I just upgraded my Tor browser. Since this I haven&#039;t been able to get onto SR. I know they were doing matenience earlier but now it&#039;s saying it is having a problem loading the page. Is this happening to anyone else? If not any suggestions on how to resolve this?<br /><br />Thanks :D<br /><br />Richie

				It&#039;s been on and off for me.&nbsp; Dropped for a few hours in early evening, but I&#039;ve had about 2 hours solid access now.&nbsp; Could have been another short update or just Tor being funky - I heard that some of the really high bandwidth nodes aren&#039;t anywhere on the latest Tor.&nbsp; Makes you wonder with the reason they did the update....

				Re: Updates<br />There have been a few updates within the past few days, everyone will take some time to get their TOR clients up to date. It is expected.

				If you can get on to surface web sites through Tor, but get timeout problems visiting .onion sites, check your system clocks time.<br /><br />The latest version of Tor tightened up the allowed clock skew, and if your clock is out by more than a few minutes from the Tor directory servers, they may not forward you the descriptors required to make a connection. This is a feature, not a bug, to prevent replay attacks, which are gaining in volume on Tor.<br /><br />As always, when experiencing problems with Tor, fire up the vidalia control panel and click on &#039;Message Log&#039; and check for any warnings it may contain. If you have a yellow high-lighted warning saying your clock disagrees with the directory server by xx minutes and xx seconds, then you will have a hard,&nbsp; if not impossible, time connecting to .onion sites.<br /><br />A lot of relays are down the last two days due to the same problem, with the change from Daylight Savings Time in Europe this weekend, lots of relays are frozen because their clocks aren&#039;t set to the proper time. A restart of the relay usually fixes this.<br /><br />This is a problem every year around DST changes, and this year is no exception.
