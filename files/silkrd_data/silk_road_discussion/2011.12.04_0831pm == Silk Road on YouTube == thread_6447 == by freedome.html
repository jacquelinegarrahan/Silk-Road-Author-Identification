				I think it might be interesting to keep a little list of major media coverage of SR. So far off the top of my head we have Gawker, wired, rolling stone, and those two douche bag senators who bit off a little more than they could chew when they raised the red flag on SR

				..i&#039;ve never heard of it before, so how did freedome find it in the 1st place?<br />Spuiten en Slikken = mainlining &amp; taking pills... ?<br /><br />so have they run stories on SR before, is the whole website and main focus on drugs or what?<br /><br />ze zijn nederlande ook?!<br />

				I found the video in a post on Reddit. <br /><br />I was bored and decided to see if anyone was talking about the SR on there so searched &#039;Silk Road&#039;. I figured if discussions regarding the SR would come up anywhere on the net, it would be on Reddit. I found the video along with quite a few threads regarding people wanting to know if anyone had tried it out. You can do exactly the same thing.<br /><br />And the video had English subtitles when I watched it.<br /><br />I got a little bit of free advertising out of it anyway, a cheeky screenshot of my listing when they were shopping around for the DMT!
