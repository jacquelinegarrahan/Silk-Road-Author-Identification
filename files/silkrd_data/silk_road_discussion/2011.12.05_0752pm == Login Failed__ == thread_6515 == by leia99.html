				I am unable to login with my old username/password. I am 100% sure that I am typing everything correctly. I can create a new account and get into the site, but am unable to use the old account. I have orders pending and need to get in with the old username/pword. Anybody else have this happen? Any ideas?

				My personal opinion is that if you can create a new account and log on, but cant log on with an old logon, that someone hijacked your account.<br /><br />Could be other reasons, but the information you provided says its not the fault of you, the hardware, or the software.&nbsp;

				Yes, I&#039;m using the new url. Was able to login the first time, but never since then. I have always accessed the site directly. How could my password have been stolen? If that is the case, what should I do about it?

				everyone who gets phished seems to claim that they always access the site directly, so you either forgot your password, or didn&#039;t actually access the site directly. how many bitcoins did you lose? I might be able to help

				I always cut and paste from a text file. And I definitely did not change my password (although I guess I should have...). Lost 37 bitcoins.<br />

				thats too bad. but since you&#039;re sure you didn&#039;t log in to a phishing site, Silk should be handling it for you. I would have helped if you thought it was possible that you were phished, but it sounds like a problem with the site in your case.<br /><br />by the way, Black market has implemented a secondary password that is only used to withdraw bitcoins after just a couple of people were phished over there. It is very hard for me to give them an ataboy, but backopy seems to actually care about his customer&#039;s money.<br />You should all be demanding that Silk Road implements the same thing! If Black Market can do it, why can&#039;t Silk?

				So it turns out I was hacked. One pending order was cancelled and I lost 16.40 bitcoins. Bummer. SR has reset m,y password, finally.

You visited a website that looked identical to the real Silk Road and gave away your username and password. This is a practice called phishing.

				you could have logged in to the correct silk road every time, but if you use the same username and password for another site like black market, you might have logged in to their phishing site, and the phisher just tried your login here on SR.<br />to avoid this, make sure you use different passwords for different sites.
