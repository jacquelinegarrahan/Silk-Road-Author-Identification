				So a few weeks ago, a SR user by the name of &quot;1stepahead&quot; contacts me out of the blue: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Hey bro i put an orda through u for a gram of gear over 3weeks ago and stil havent recieved it yet. I am curious to know were it is bro. I have bulk purchases on here and im having trouble finding the date and transaction number. I spend over 20thousand a week on here so i got transaction numbers out my ass. I realy hope there is somethng to sort out what i lost. I hope we kan get this sorted as i would purchase a hel of alot more bkoz quality of the ice here in perth is adverage so ive been looking hard to find absolute dynamite gear bkoz i wil purchase fukn truck loads pw&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So wtf is this. I&#039;ve never sold this guy any 1 gram of Crystal Meth. He never purchased any. There was no orders, no messages from him previously. He cannot provide a date of purchase, or the transaction number - And there was no way it would have auto-finalized early, because there would be a record in Transaction history. <br /><br />He then proceeds to threaten me, says if I don&#039;t want to tarnish my reputation, I will fix this situation and send him the product. I message him saying where is the proof or details that he ever ordered from me, because I have certainly never seen the order. After a few back and forth messages, threats of violence from bikies - he makes me an offer:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Il tel u what il gve u my phne even if u send me half a gram now and half when we sort this fuck up out would be fair for both parties champ. Thats an easy resolution.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s really fair it seems. I decline and tell him to contact admin to find out whats going, because if he actually lost money, SR has it, not me. He agrees. Two weeks have passed. Today I login to get a message from him again:<br /><br />&quot;Silk road said that orda was placed to u and bitcoins taken so wtf man. Why dog me&quot; <br /><br />Something isn&#039;t right with this dude. Any input? Kinda frustrating and trying to stay calm when most of his messages are accusing me of scamming and taking his money without sending his order and that this isn&#039;t the way to be a vendor etc. WTF.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\

				YOU contact SR. Doesn&#039;t rely on him. Clearly he has no proof of buying from you. Given such, is it really such a surprise that he would lie and claim that they are on his side? He wants a free gram of fucking meth. Clearly the guy is an addict, clearly you need to be doing something more than trusting him to tell you the truth. How naive are you, seriously?<br /><br />But clearly he&#039;s just a waste of life trying to get free drugs.<br /><br />Also, his name is 1stepahead. Does he need to paint you a picture that says &quot;I am a scammer&quot; on top of that? He knows what he&#039;s doing, and he&#039;s trying to rip you off...<br /><br />Or you really did lose the records of the transaction. Fortunately, account-history is kept for 3 months so you can go back and check every single one of your transactions to see if you had an order from him that got passed-over before.

				Well I know he&#039;s obviously scamming, but I posted this to show just how blatantly obvious his attempt is. I have the transaction history and of course there is nothing there to show that he has paid or made an order. I mean, there&#039;s no way an order would have been missed in the first place. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99417.msg698954#msg698954">Quote from: BlarghRawr on January 03, 2013, 01:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">YOU contact SR.

				Was it necessary for the insult ? I thought the forums was a place of fair discussion.

				Dude don&#039;t worry about some dickhead telling you he will tarnish your rep on here, Many people will see this post and I agree this forum should be a place of fairness and a place to come for advice if needed. So dude just ignore the messages, I have to agree with most people in saying he&#039;s an addict trying to get free drugs.... Also he says in very very very bad English, that he will buy truck loads off you... Dude he&#039;s just said you owe him a gram, He is a scammer, Someone who buys truck loads does not buy a gram :) Just screw him and chin up! ^_^

				No worries. <br /><br />Since he didn&#039;t order from you, he can&#039;t affect the rep that counts most - your vendor feedback stats. <br /><br />If he comes on the forum and attempts to ruin your rep, buyers will see the attempt for what it is since the claim of scamming<br />won&#039;t match your Vendor rating on SR. In fact, some of your past customers would probably chime in and defend your rep<br />by relaying their positive experiences.<br /><br />So you&#039;re all good.

				Look,<br /><br />He has no proof that he bought something from you, it sounds like he is trying to scam you. It is not your fault he let his own transaction autofinalize if it is actually true he did place an order but the fact that you cant find any tracking from him or anything in the transaction history from him makes him look bad, sounds like a scammer who is addicted and trying to get free product.<br /><br />If an order is not in transit, or in transaction history and I can&#039;t find any feedback saying finalize early from customer anywhere nor find any tracking number from them then I would treat situation politely but pointing out that I cant ship out something just bc he is saying he ordered from me.

				Hate to hear that a vendor fell for the scam. Good thing you didn&#039;t fall for it. <br />Even if it were for real he let it auto finalize. More than enough time for a buyer to to file a not revived complaint. <br /><br />Scam buyers hurt the site as much as vendors. We will all send him negative energy.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t sweat it. But understand your frustration. No one wants to be harassed or face blackmail. <br />

First it says the upload folder is full, and the latter is down according to fellow SR forum members.<br /><br />The latest update is that he just gave me his phone number, because he is too desperate in receiving the product and so would like me to text him the tracking number lol.<br /><br />I will see what I can do to upload the screenshot to other working onion image hosting.

				I get this all the time. People target busy vendors claiming to have made an order when they did not. They are looking for refunds or freebies.<br /><br />If they cannot product a transaction number then don&#039;t believe them.
