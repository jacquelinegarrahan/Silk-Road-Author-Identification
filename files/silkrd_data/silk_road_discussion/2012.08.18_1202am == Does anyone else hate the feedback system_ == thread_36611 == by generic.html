				My problem with the current feedback system is this, as a buyer I pretty much have to give a 5/5 rating as long as I get my package. I&#039;ve had sellers use sub-par packaging, and I&#039;ve had shipments that took twice as long as expected, but if you give a rating less than 5/5 you&#039;ll likely get blacklisted by that seller and maybe others.<br /><br />My solution to this would be whenever a buyer fills out a review there are two fields. The buyer can select I received my order, or I did not receive my order. And then a field for rate your experience (1-5). A seller would have two rankings % orders received, and % customer satisfaction.<br /><br />If I saw a seller with 100% orders received, and 85% satisfaction, I&#039;d still feel confident ordering much better than a seller that just has 85% positive feedback.<br /><br />Even if we don&#039;t use that, I think the current feedback system could be better. Every review I see is for 5/5 Thats not really honest feedback, because I know every order isn&#039;t a 5/5.

By messaging the seller you let them know you have an issue, if there is nothing they can do to make it right then they should accept the feedback. The issue arises when a buyer leaves less than 5/5 without messaging the seller first. <br /><br />Let the seller know you have a problem, we all want happy customers and most of us work hard to make our customers happy and comfortable with there purchase.

Never trust FE-based comments that haven&#039;t been updated.

				This might be stupid and people would probably give hyped up reviews anyway but i think we should move to a 10 out of 10 it gives people more room to judge themproduct without making the vendor look bad for simple mistakes.&nbsp;

				5- Perfect. Fast shipping, Good packaging, Even better product.<br /><br />4- Great. Good ship time. Good packaging. Product was not as good as was advertised/damaged.<br /><br />3- Alright. Took a while to get here but no worries. Packaging needs improvement. Product was okay, not great.<br /><br />2- Bad. Took a week to ship after marked in transit. Packaging was terrible. Product was shit and underweight.<br /><br />1- Terrible. No product/Damaged beyond use/No communication/Took four weeks to ship domestically.<br /><br /><br />These are just examples, but it&#039;s how I rate. I DO leave a review/reason though. If a vendor doesnt make it to a 5, I dont use em again. Simple.

				My policy - <br /><br />If anyone leaves me less than 5 and DON&#039;T give me a chance to put things right, which if I&#039;m in the wrong I am happy to do, they get blacklisted and if they really take the piss I&#039;ll drag their name through the public forum too.<br /><br />On top of that I wont deal with them again. <br /><br />Harsh but fair IMO.

				The feedback system is too simplistic for what&#039;s being sold and all the factors that go into it. I agree, there should be multiple categories and a 10 point system. The problem comes from a 100 rating being so easily attainable, and all vendors trying to get it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36611.msg416412#msg416412">Quote from: Limetless on August 18, 2012, 07:07 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My policy - <br /><br />If anyone leaves me less than 5 and DON&#039;T give me a chance to put things right, which if I&#039;m in the wrong I am happy to do, they get blacklisted and if they really take the piss I&#039;ll drag their name through the public forum too.<br /><br />On top of that I wont deal with them again. <br /><br />Harsh but fair IMO.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But what if it&#039;s something you can&#039;t just &quot;make right&quot; like that? Like, for example, if they just weren&#039;t satisfied with quality for the price, or something. They just don&#039;t think your level of service deserves a 5/5. Does the person still get a blacklist?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see why a vendor is entitled to a 5/5 if they did something wrong and I had to go out of my way to get them to make it right. It&#039;s&nbsp; great if it&#039;s just a one time mistake from an honest vendor, but a less than honest vendor could easily manipulate a policy like that<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a pretty lax feedback giver myself, I&#039;ve given 5s to everyone (except fredrick, who admitted to sending fake adderall to a few buyers and never made it right after saying he would, even though I offered to pay shipping.) My view is, if product is as promised and packaging was good enough, you&#039;ve done a perfect job as a vendor.<br /><br />
