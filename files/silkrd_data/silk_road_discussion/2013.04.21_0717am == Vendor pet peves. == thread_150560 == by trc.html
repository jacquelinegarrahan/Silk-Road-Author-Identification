				If your a buyer please try avoid these things.<br />Other vendors feel free to add.<br /><br />1.Leaving a low rating because I dint give you tracking even though you never asked.<br />2.Leaving low rating because the mail was slow. (We sell drugs we don&#039;t deliver your mail.<br />3.Claiming a vendor is a scammer because a tracked package goes to the the return address. Do you really think a vendor would give you the tracking number that is going back to him and risk years in jail?<br />5.Unorganized addresses Bob Smith is not a country last time I checked.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />6. lowering rating because of a drugs look, white mdma is white mdma brown mdma is also mdma and when you crash it into powder it wont break the mdma molecule so dont coplain about not getting a 1oz rock.(unless the vendor says it will be all big sass smelling rocks and you make a deal on looks smell ect)<br />7. If you buy domestic crack heroin or meth&nbsp; and you have a 50% refund rate dont ask for a refund and don&#039;t leave a 1/5 because your scam attempted failed. <br />8. If theirs an issue don&#039;t just leave a low rating talk to the vendor first most of them are very reasonable leaving a 1/5 gives you nothing but talking to them can only help your situation,
