				That&#039;s just a glitch, don&#039;t worry. I was just as puzzled as you the first time it happened to me. I sent so many 0&#039;s to one vendor, always trying to apologize, until he just started ignoring me completely, LOL. <br />This has been a known problem for some time, and I&#039;m sure most vendors know that.

				If you have only&nbsp; received one msg, then he did write you something that was turned into 0.&nbsp; You can msg them about it, they probably didnt notice, since it goes directly into&nbsp; &quot;sent msgs&quot;.

				This happened to me for the first time after the outage.&nbsp; It was from a vendor i use to obtain bit coins.&nbsp; I thought i was being black balled or something.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you started this thread because i didn&#039;t know what it was.
