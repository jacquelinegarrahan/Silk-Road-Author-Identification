				Not talking about the actual forum as a website, but more like what people say here. <br /><br />Thing that gets me the most is when people talk about money laundering. Two things about it actually. <br /><br />The first when they give away basic techniques.. These techniques work for a reason, when you get every Tom, Dick and Harry using them, that can definitely effect the effectiveness of said technique.<br /><br />The other is when people say things like &#039;Where can I get a debit card to launder my money&#039;... That is not laundering money! That is purely hiding/storing your money, if someone was ever to come across it you still don&#039;t have an explanation to why it&#039;s there.<br /><br />Laundering is the act of making money that has come from one source, look like it&#039;s from a completely different one. Usually from a not so legit source, to look like it&#039;s coming from a legitimate business. Yes, you have to pay tax on it. Yes, if it&#039;s a lot you&#039;ll be raped by the tax man. <br /><br />But at least then nobody can question how you have all these nice things in your life. <br /><br /><br />Other than that, the spam really fucks me off as well. <br /><br />What gets to all my SR buddies?

				There are ways to launder money without paying income taxes. Tax exempt income. <br /><br />What gets me about the people on the forums is when someone is referring to another post, but they don&#039;t quote it or reference it somewhere in their post. Please clarify your forum posts by referencing all related parties. Is this too much to ask?

				Not at all @ you MyAnonymous, @ the topic:<br /><br />When people flame me in my own thread because they do not agree with something I said, instead of posting saying that they disagree with this or that, so that I can respond. It&#039;s even better when their responses appear to suggest that they took something I said personally when it has nothing to do with them, when they think I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about because they disagree with me, are barely on topic, don&#039;t provide any support or points, are personal attacks/insults, angry/mad/emotional, dumb/lazy/whimsical, tweakish, etc. <br /><br />It&#039;s possible to disagree with someone in a response in a constructive way that promotes dialog. Flaming, trolling, taking things personally because you disagree with something, giving negative Karma because you disagree with something, this is all undesirable immature behavior. I don&#039;t think negative Karma was intended to be given when you simply disagree with what someone says.<br /><br />+1 @ I wonder where you got the idea for this thread ; )

				How long have you got?&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I love this community but there are a few things that I would love to see change. If all new forum members had to read the SR wiki in full and confirm they have done so before being allowed to post it would solve many of the issues I spend many hours every day dealing with.<br /><br />Every forum has some but the crazy ranters who post 200 word unpunctuated sentences using the dreaded CAPS LOCK are a real pain in the ass albeit sometimes amusing.<br /><br />For the most part though this place brings me nothing but pleasure&nbsp; ;D

				I get annoyed by people constantly posting reviews or giving 5/5 feedback before they&#039;ve even tested the product. I mean, shipping and stealth, communication etc. is all important, but it means jack all if the product is shit.
