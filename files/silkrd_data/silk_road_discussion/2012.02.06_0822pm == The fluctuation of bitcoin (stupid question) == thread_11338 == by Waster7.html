				I&#039;m interested in an item but at the current moment, it is more expensive to purchase it on SR, then for me to go to a local dealer.<br />I then noticed that back in December, the exchange rate was far far lower.<br /><br /><br />Are items prices fixed, or will people constantly change the price of their items as this happens?<br /><br />

				All (or most?) prices are fixed against the USD. So the number of BTC for any purchase will be adjusted by the SR system automatically each 15mins or so (or maybe each hour, but you get the idea). <br /><br />[edit]<br /><br />Best go to your settings page, and just show prices in USD. Much easier all round.

				So basically: <br /><br />There is no chance of buying something cheaper then the current price, because the price adjusts itself when the rates rise and fall?

				The prices are generally fixed, but you also have to factor in the fees increases etc. since December - these have impacted on prices across the board, and sellers other overheads may also have gone up.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.0<br /><br />That&#039;s SR&#039;s State of the Road address; the relevant part of the message about rates is:<br /><br />&quot;We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.&nbsp; The average response looked like this:<br /><br />15% of the first $10<br />11% of $10 - $50<br />8.14% of $50 - $250<br />5.6% of $250 - $1000<br />3.7% of $1000 - $5000<br /><br />We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000&quot;
