				Hi I know this should probably be in shipping but its dead there at the min. I am thinking about getting about Oz of pollen hash from O/S from what seems like a very good vendor however after asking him a few questions about stealth he said that he uses a bubble envelope hmmmm bit risky O/S but he has been a vendor for almost a year and has 100 percent feed back and every order made it or so he said, what do you guys think he said its all official with everything else rtn address etc?

				Don&#039;t do it. Plenty of great vendors with plenty of great products. No additional exposure needed.

				I know what your saying, I have orders from O/S no problems for more in the past, its to expensive domestic for premium hash at the moment some charging over $100 per gram.

Possibility of troubles or the packaging not making it? Personally, I would say its not. Id much rather spend the extra for peace of mind and the almost guarantee that my domestic order will arrive safe and sound.
