				This thread is dedicated to a discussion on where to source sassafras, and strategy to obtaining the oil.<br /><br />Since Ron Paul no longer is selling his sassafras source. I decided to start a thread for sourcing sassafras on your own within the US. As everyone knows, sassafras is a heavily watched schedual I precursor, so extreme caution must be taken when ordering.<br /><br />Ive looked around in numerous places<br /><br />1. ebay<br />2. Alibaba (international trade, P2P)<br />3. Google<br /><br />The main difficulty ive been having with ebay is that alot of &quot;sassafras&quot; oil is synthetic, or the safrole has been completely removed rendering it useless. How will I know if the oil I purchase has safrole? Do i ask them in a round about way?<br /><br />Alibaba, sasafras is everywhere, and dirt cheap. However, your ordering over international borders which is an obvious threat. If your have drop locations, and have a way to send payments anonamously via bank transfer, then this might be ideal.<br /><br />Google-ing websites, is very very hard. Has anyone found any legit websites? It seems the ones i do find im unsure contain safrole, or they have a monthly limit.<br /><br /><br />Any help on this subject would be appreciated!

				I have a few good answers for you based on present/past experience.<br /><br />1. there is a place in u.s. but you have to get only a little per month.&nbsp; You can order the maximum order every month and after 6 months you have enough.&nbsp; very high safrole.&nbsp; very high, i was totally impressed.<br /><br />2. U either order sass rootbark from an particular ebay vendor who sells it very moist or i harvest it myself .&nbsp; if your in eastern/southern u.s. this might be a possibility.&nbsp; I will get 5 friends and spend a day in the woods and come out with half of a pickup truck bed full.&nbsp; That is ALOT !!!<br />I would then sell on ebay and distill.&nbsp; at this point one could make gallons of sass oil and then do a simple distill to produce a beautiful water-white safrole.&nbsp; so pretty.<br /><br />ordering rootbark is easy but freshness is vital.&nbsp; sass oil is very volatile, meaning it evaps at normal temp and pressure.<br />
