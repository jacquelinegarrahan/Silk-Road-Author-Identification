				I never ask for FE, but I also havent been burned yet at a vendor.<br /><br /><br />there is a bit more too it. there is an angle that buyers play with new accounts to attempt to get a refund from SR even after their items arrive. this is the scare some vendors have with new people.<br /><br />My rule has always been if you make me wait 17 days from Auto Finalize, I will not deal with you again. oh yeah..and I have a photographic memory :)<br /><br />If you are a new new buyer...not just a new accnt, then just make some small purchases or some vendors don&#039;t even care if you buy digital goods to get your stats up. Ebooks etc.<br />

				Please be careful FEing...I&#039;m new too (just completed my first transaction!) and I read all the information I could find in these forums and it seems like most of the scams happen with people FEing early. Just be really cautious and preferably go for smaller amounts if you&#039;re being asked to FE. Also shop around too because you can find many vendors who don&#039;t mind taking on new buyers and won&#039;t ask them to FE.

				knickknack, the risk for a vendor doing business with a new buyer is he MIGHT win a resolution for a bit of weed or a ten strip, but you will likely settle for a shared loss which means a vendor can recoup at least a large portion of the cost that was paid by them for the item that was stolen, lost, whatever.<br /><br />the ramifications of FE for the buyer can be summarized by tony76(100) $200 something thousand taken from people who wanted to expand their minds with ZERO recoup of their money, PERIOD.<br /><br />sure the (100) isn&#039;t by his nym anymore, but that doesn&#039;t make the loss suffered by all those people any less, does it.<br /><br />If as a vendor, you don&#039;t have enough margin worked into your business plan to cover the occasional write off, then you need to look at lowering your input costs, streamlining your operation, or (if nothing else can help) raise your prices (fractionally) to spread the risk over the entire business venture. <br /><br />You could quantify it even my marking an &quot;insurance&quot; account in your ledger. put a small % of each sale into the insurance account, and if you run across a lost sale by either scam or loss, you move that cost into the balance sheet of current expenditures to cover it. IF you build a surplus into this account in your ledger, you can apply it to a &quot;sale&quot; for loyal customers or fractionally reduce your price across the board, which would result in the same margins,&nbsp; so there is no downside. And you can do ALL this without becoming part of the group who IS responsible for the rise of those like Tony76.<br /><br />While Tony76 is an evil fuckwad, he was brought into existence by honest vendors who didn&#039;t want to put forth the effort to build a provable business model where each party is protected and held accountable for their actions.<br /><br />I blame the common vendor with an FE policy for Tony76 more than I blame the man, and trust me I blame that man PLENTY!

				I learned my lesson with early finalization one time. NEVER AGAIN. but starting out you will most likely not have a choice because vendors require it. but after you get good stats and have been here a long time you dont have to worry. Even sellers that require it dont bother asking me after they see my stats usually

				Finalise early needs to be burnt with fire. Would love to see it out-right banned, though likely not to happen. <br /><br />The only time FE is possibly okay is when it&#039;s a very reputable seller whom you&#039;ve already had several successful deals with.
