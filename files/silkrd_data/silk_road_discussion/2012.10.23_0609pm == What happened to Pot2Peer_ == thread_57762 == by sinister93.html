				A while back pot2peer disappeared, do you think he got arrested? He had a website that linked to his tor website. His website www.pot2peer.com is now suspended and his tor site his down. That makes me suspect the police took it down. What do you think?

				I read somewhere else on the forums that he was redirecting customers to his own darknet site where they could buy from him with no SR fees. I don&#039;t know if this is true at all though.

I&#039;m glad that sellers aren&#039;t allowed to advertise their darknet sites because otherwise the amount of people scammed would certainly hit the roof!
