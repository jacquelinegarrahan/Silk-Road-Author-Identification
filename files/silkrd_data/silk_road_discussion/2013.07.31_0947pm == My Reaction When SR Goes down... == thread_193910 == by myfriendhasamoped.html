				I usually start by swearing, convinced that the only time SR ever goes down is the day I just sent bitcoins to my wallet while I convince myself that somehow the coins will get lost in cyberspace never to be seen again. I curse my idiocy for doing this in the first place, complain to myself that I shouldn&#039;t send large quantities of coins in one transaction to my wallet.<br /><br />Then I check the forum for DPR&#039;s message and start hitting refresh complusively. I read a few posts that speculate the end of the world is here and DPR has been busted and when it comes back up it&#039;ll be a honey pot for LE. <br /><br />Then I begin to curse myself for waiting until I&#039;m almost out of whatever it is I was planning to buy and wonder why I&#039;m such an ass for not ordering a little in advance. I relive the last few days and say &quot;why didn&#039;t you just take 2 that day instead of that third one you asshole?&quot; <br /><br />I criticize my inability to ration and go back to those wonderful days when I had a full inventory and over-did it just because I could not because taking even more made me feel any better and say - &quot;boy asshole, that one extra that day sure would be good right now!&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;I check under the couch cushions for that one I&#039;m always convinced will be there.<br /><br />&nbsp; I ponder quitting and start to think of all the things I should be spending my money on instead.<br /><br />&nbsp;I develop my plan to deal with the horrors of being out of my item and panic about how terrible it&#039;s going to be and I start to wonder, &quot;How is it people find real life drug dealers?&quot; Should I just start cruising the worst parts of town asking people if they can sell me drugs? I get pissed at myself for not having a real world source. <br /><br />As desperation sets in that this time SR may not come back I wonder: Should I go to a bar and loudly complain to total strangers &quot;Fuck, my knee hurts, I&#039;d blow a total stranger for some pain meds!&quot; and hope someone bites but will accept cash instead.I convince myself I will be arrested if I try this and then ponder how bad prison could actually be. Is it like OZ, or just shows that make it look like a boring school?<br /><br />&nbsp;I think about a trip to the ER for meds. I start to weigh withdrawal, vs jail, vs professional help.<br /><br />Then I see the login screen and get very excited and place my order only to get buyers remorse after. I then begin complaining that the vendor hasn&#039;t shipped yet.<br /><br />&nbsp;It just occurred to me I may have a problem with drugs&nbsp; :)

				Has my account been compromised? (&#039;cause my password doesn&#039;t work)<br />Have my BitCoin been stolen? (probably not, &#039;cause I rarely have any)<br />Do the FEDs know I&#039;m on SR? (I&#039;m using TAILS, so that&#039;s rather unlikely)<br />...and then I go to the Forums to see what&#039;s happening. I&#039;m actually more concerned when the Forums go down. This is the ONLY place I&#039;ve found in .onionland with real people in it.<br /><br />I think that truly says something about Silk Road.
