				Ok guys...<br /><br />I understand that I&#039;m new here...I don&#039;t have any history, any feedback, any ratings...and I understand that people have to protect themselves...<br /><br />But bitcoins are sort of a bitch to acquire and I don&#039;t have money to be wasting on things like books which don&#039;t interest me just so I can raise my buyer rating...<br /><br />Also, I sent the seller a message and never got a reply...just a cancellation...I&#039;d appreciate a reason...any reason why...<br /><br />&nbsp;:(

I understand it can be frustrating but don&#039;t take it too harshly - there are plenty of reputable vendors out there that are willing to work with new buyers, especially new buyers that are also posting on the forums.<br /><br />Don&#039;t feel too bad about the cancellation though! I recently placed an order to the value of about $25 for a small amount of viagra and had it cancelled by the vendor. I have perfect stats, over $8,100 spent and 40+ transactions so it doesn&#039;t just happen to newbies!!<br />Some vendors just decline some orders for their own reasons; perhaps they&#039;re out of stock of that particular item, perhaps they also sell locally and someone bought their entire supply, perhaps they just don&#039;t like to work with certain people or 101 other possibilities. They&#039;re free to make that choice, and don&#039;t have to provide a reason for it.<br /><br />What exactly are you looking for? I might be able to point you in the direction of a reputable vendor willing to work with new members. Feel free to PM me if you don&#039;t want to post it openly on thread.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Buying Ebooks won&#039;t help your stats anyway, we see the total amount you&#039;ve spent here as well as the number of orders :)<br />As Grahamgreene said above there are lots of vendors that welcome new buyers, even ones that won&#039;t require FE and will let you&nbsp; stay in escrow.<br />Look at new vendors, they cannot demand FE and often have good deals to attract customers and build feedback, help them get a foothold and you can enjoy a good relationship in the future :)

				When I first started here I didn&#039;t want to waste times on e-books either.<br /><br />What I did was took some time and started going through the products I was looking for and read vendor reviews and sent some messages out to vendors that didn&#039;t require FE on their profile. After a few days I made contact with some good vendors willing to work with me and made purchases.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it makes a difference to all the vendors, but some definitely seemed to appreciate it and communication can&#039;t hurt and saves time on canceled orders. In fact I didn&#039;t even send bitcoin into my account until I knew I found I a trusted vendor willing to work with me.

				I received my first package last week and already have two more orders in transit, I&#039;m a new buying and not a single vendor asked me to FE...you just gotta pick out a vendor who seems to be running a good business.

It is all about customer service and if that is a real vendors customer service then they will loose customers.<br /><br />gestaltassault, It happens, <br /><br />How about some advice from a vendor.<br /><br />First, read the listing then read the vendor profile. Some vendors will have restrictions or requirements for new users listed in their profile. Things that I have seen are &quot;New customers must buy $100 of product on their first order&quot;, &quot;People with less than 10 buys must FE&quot;, and &quot;New customers must message me first before ordering&quot;<br /><br />If you did not follow the vendors directions then there is a chance that they will just cancel the order.<br /><br />I personally would not hesitate to drop a vendor a message, however keep it short and to the point we do not always have time to read through a long winded message and try to figure out what you are asking. The wait for an answer. I personally would not order from a vendor that did not take the time to reply to a short quick question, but that is me.<br /><br />There are some vendors, like myself, that work with new buyers a lot. We are responsive to questions and dont mind helping people through there first purchase.

				This thread gives me some hope, being a new buyer.<br /><br />I can already envision the headaches that await me though. I can understand the concern in trusting a new buyer though, as I&#039;m hesitant to trust a new vendor. I suppose I&#039;ll have to do my research.

				What I&#039;ve done is go to the cannabis review thread on this forum. Go to the latest reviews, search some of the names that are there, and then purchas from one who doesn&#039;t require FE. I have now made 3 purchases and actually was able to purchase from a vendor that usually requires FE by pm&#039;ing the vendor in advance and asking permission. The vendor requested I buy a gram instead of the eighth and I did so. There are plenty of vendors who don&#039;t require FE. I strongly suggest trying to only purchase from those vendors&nbsp; and NEVER EVER FE if you dont know who you&#039;re purchasing from

				Gestaltassault, I guess a vender has every right to cancel an order, but it would be nice for communication (if possible - maybe they got busted manufacturing).<br /><br />Don&#039;t loose heart, and yes, plenty of vendors don&#039;t require FE.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D
