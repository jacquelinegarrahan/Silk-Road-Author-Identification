				So, the problem of peer-to-peer file sharing (torrents, DHT) and peer-to-peer currency (Bitcoin) has been solved by the humanity. Yay.<br /><br />How about peer-to-peer _service_ - to power SR, Wikileaks, and other targeted organizations? Wouldn&#039;t that be the ultimate &quot;fuck you&quot; to the prohibitionists / controlling governments / suppressors of public freedom? Could we get rid of SR&#039;s only weak point (centralized servers)?<br /><br />I envision buyers and sellers having a private key that identifies them. Transactions are performed in Bitcoin fashion. Everyone have a rating and a transaction count to show their reliability. Heck, this could even replace legitimate services like Ebay.<br /><br />Not sure how escrow and reviews would be handled and stored - any ideas?<br /><br />Do you think something like that is possible? Do you know of the projects that have attempted implementing a peer-to-peer service?

				I remember hearing something a few months ago about how all of The Pirate Bay&#039;s content can fit on a flash drive and essentially be rebooted by anyone. Would that be a viable direction for Silk Road? Or is that what you are suggesting?<br /><br />My apologies if I appear to be talking out of my ass, I don&#039;t know very much about this subject at all :o

				A P2P rating system already exists: GPG web of trust.<br /><br />One implementation of GPG WOT is bitcoin-otc. Even if the website itself is centralized, the rating database can be downloaded and mirrored by anyone who feels like it. Also, since it uses cryptography, the ratings can&#039;t be forged, unless the attacker gets hold of the users&#039; private keys. So even if bitcoin-otc isn&#039;t fully p2p, it&#039;s a step in the right direction.<br /><br />Various P2P forums and file storage systems exist. It should be possible to combine them into a Marketplace. eg .the Retroshare forum feature could be used for posting offers, and tahoe-lafs for storing pictures.
