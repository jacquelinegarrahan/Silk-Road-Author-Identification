				Just wondering why these forums are still up?&nbsp; <br /><br />obviously everything is being read by the government on here.&nbsp; are they just waiting for people to collaborate on a new site so they can try to shut it down again?&nbsp; <br /><br />it was fun while it lasted but now its over.&nbsp; go find your drugs from real life people now folks,&nbsp; I don&#039;t think ordering online is worth the risk anymore.

				sorry for asking.&nbsp; I knew SR went down the day it happened but havn&#039;t stumbled onto the forums until now because i just assumed they were gone as well.&nbsp; you would think if the US government was serious about preventing online drugtrade they would have tried a little harder to find these forums and shut them down too.&nbsp; now people are once again banding together and finding a new website to buy/sell drugs on. <br /><br />Just because these forums are technically &#039;legal&#039; does not prevent the US government from shutting them down.&nbsp; they make their own rules and often break their own rules.&nbsp; they do whatever the fuck they want.&nbsp; don&#039;t let the idea of&nbsp; &quot;i have rights&quot; fucking fool u.&nbsp; there are no more rights in America this place is like Nazi Germany now.&nbsp;

It&#039;s become a place to discuss conspiracy theories, to recount events, and to reminisce. In other words, it&#039;s historical now and is like the bajillion other drug forums online.

Some forums ban that language altogether for that very reason. Saying SWIM does not protect you in any way. Like, do you think people are that stupid (as in juries, prosecutors, judges, etc.)?<br /><br />And the fuck I can&#039;t smoke a joint in public. I do it all the fucking time (just about every time I go for a walk. I may not be able to walk by a cop doing it, but I still do it. The only thing that bothers cops about smoking joints in public is that it&#039;s flagrant; they don&#039;t care about recreational/medical users of marijuana. This site isn&#039;t being used&nbsp; for distribution anymore, which is all they&#039;re interested in.<br /><br />Also, not all of those sites are about harm reduction. Many are about using. You&#039;ll find many forums that detail how to make the new Oxycontin formulation snortable, injectable, etc., how to parachute pills, how to make a meth pipe McGuyver style. Giving advice in the form of &quot;harm reduction&quot; is the same as facilitating use legally speaking. FWIW, I&#039;m all for harm reduction, and that&#039;s also a large part of this forum.

				Is it even worth asking this question?<br /><br />Even if (hypothetically) these forums were somehow intertwined with the SR main site, and (also hypothetically) I was LE - i&#039;d be making a conscious effort to leave this up and running. <br /><br />Whether its a coincidence or not that we&#039;re still here - something tells me i&#039;d still be writing this whether they had the access to shut this down or not. The shit being posted on here is some pretty good scoop, surely. Why would they forfeit that? Just because they&#039;ve taken down SR doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re done with this whole shebang. More likely, Its only just beginning - I hope so at least, because if that statement were true it would mean we put up enough fight to give them a new project, or several. <br /><br />They&#039;ll continue in their efforts to disband the community, to take down other marketplaces, to win the &#039;war on drugs&#039; and their assault on what SHOULD be basic human freedoms. <br /><br />And in the hours/days after the main site went down - the drama and information shared here would surely have been a great way to inform their next steps in this saga. Think about it... They didn&#039;t have a chance at taking down SR in its early days because frankly, they didn&#039;t know about it... folks like us had the head start. But now? All they have to do is read around this place for 20 minutes and they&#039;ve found something to entertain themselves with.
