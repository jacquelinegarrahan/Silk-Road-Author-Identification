				Hello,<br />Yes silkroad is still down, but after just completing the harvest, I am simply to eager to wait for it to come back up. Many of you already know me for my spectacular weed, and ever better concentrates. Being in the top 3% with 99% feedback does not come easy. It takes hard work, and incredible product. So to make light of a bad situation and to give back to those that have helped me achieve such a status, I will be hosting a sale on my newly harvested bud and maybe even some specials on the wax&nbsp; ;). This sale will be going on for the next two days, and will end Friday morning! (I can&#039;t let it all go for such a special price&nbsp; ::))<br /><br /><br />Strains that I have just Harvested:<br /><br />Blue Dream&nbsp; (My famous blue dream that has everyone coming back for more, this harvest is just as good, if not better than the last.)<br />Sour Diesel&nbsp; (For those that would like a nice strong punch)<br />Chem Dawg (This is a world famous strain, and honestly my favorite, perfect for any time, very potent.)<br /><br />And special for only this occasion (from my personal stash), Purple Kush:<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=06ab3f113edef40a1945d235faf0f833.jpg<br /><br />Please note that there is a very limited quantity on the Purple Kush and it comes on a first come first get service.<br /><br />The sale prices have been set as the following:<br />1 gram - $20<br />Eight - $40<br />Quarter - $75<br />Half - $145<br />Ounce - $260<br /><br /><br />Please note that there will be an added charge of $5 for priority shipping. All shipping is done secure and triple vacuum sealed. We use the best stealth and our feedback shows that :). Please pm me for prices on the wax, I can do a very nice deal for orders of 2 or more grams.<br /><br />PM me with your orders. If I run out of the sale stock, sorry but I can&#039;t give it all away.<br /><br />Looking forward to our future business, and I hope you appreciate the sales,<br /><br />norcal420hookup

				That doesn&#039;t mean anything. Since you have no history on the forum someone reputable is going to have to verify your key is really that of norcal420hookup.

				I HAVE ALREADY BUSTED HIM IN THE SAME THREAD HE STARTED IN PRODUCT OFFERS!!<br />===========<br />Ahahaha, oh wow. I was certain my Internet sleuthing wouldn&#039;t be enough to figure this one out, but it was almost too easy.<br /><br />Saved the picture OP posted, checked tineye.com first, got nothing<br /><br />images.google.com upload found an identical match from a grasscity.com forum member posted in August.<br /><br />Evidence is as follows-<br />CLEARNET of course:<br /><br />http://i1258.photobucket.com/albums/ii535/subarublazin/photo-2.jpg<br />Photobucket which the GC forum user linked<br /><br />http://forum.grasscity.com/stash-jar/1074081-nw-tx-pickups-4.html<br />Grasscity thread with this picture at the very bottom posted over 3 months ago.<br /><br />Checkmate, scammer. Screencaptures are already saved. Your move.<br />=================<br />Spread the word and stop this ASAP, I am already posting anywhere this scammer has been. Also, unlicensed PGP key is another huge tip-off, he did not have a key generated in the same manner on his profile, I guarantee that.

				I don&#039;t know who the imposter is that is using my name, but luckily my customers are smart enough not to fall for that lame bullshit to scam using my name. This just came to my attention today and i&#039;ll be taking action. I updated my listings on SR and if your able to connect to the site feel free to place an order there.
