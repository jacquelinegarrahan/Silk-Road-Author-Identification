				SR is not a drug site, it&#039;s a marketplace, drugs just happen to be the principle market. No need to get your panties in a twist.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />This is very much true. Many vendors with tons of btc to burn are thrilled to have a vendor that sells electronics at a reasonable price. &#039;&#039;Half the other electronic vendors try to sell MacBooks for 2 times what the cost.&#039;&#039; Personally as a vendor myself who has purchased off TheGoodSon a few times now am very happy for his service. Great shipping times and hellacious deals. $225 shipped for a $1200 laptop. Sold as used but barely with only 3 charge cycles on it is pretty fucking awesome. <br /><br />Oh back to the point. He is right drugs primarily &#039;cannabis&#039; is the principle market. And those people selling those drugs find TheGoodSon&#039;s services handy. And no matter what it is you sell honest legit vendors that don&#039;t make you FE are hard to find.
