				I have read multiple post going back a while since the btc has taken off asking for 8 decimals or at least more then 2. A few of the post have even said something to the affect is DPR robbing(us) by only having 2 decimals, and numerous other shit like that. <br /><br />Well he has gone to 8 decimals!! More importantly realize that he (DPR) if he wanted to rob/steal/take could easily do so. Like just shutting the site down and shutting the forums down. I think that would work pretty well.<br /><br />I know a lot of you were just asking and not accusing...I get it..but to even ask is stupid. A lot of you I know are smart guys. But some of you are dumb as shit.<br /><br />Bottom line is yet once again DPR does the right thing, and SR is still the best site to buy and sell drugs. PERIOD.

				Still only see 2 digits throughout. Try to enter something like 0.035 BTC for shipping, it&#039;ll get rounded to 0.04.

				The fact that I mentioned Office Space while accusing dpr of shaving decimals, I thought was pretty indicative that I was joking.<br /><br />Next time I&#039;ll use the [this is a joke so dont get your panties in a bunch] tags.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Remember when the SR QUCKBUY thing happened. All the vendors had to re-set their shipping options.

				I was the first to point out the lack of significant digits, and no I was not a dumbass for doing so Rxking.<br /><br />In the world of business if you hide anything such as that it is my RIGHT and DUTY to point out the flaw and insecurity.&nbsp; DPR of course is a good guy and has always kept his word but when you don&#039;t quickly solve a problem as big as not accurately showing btc transfers you are bringing either suspicion of wrongdoing or incompetence.&nbsp; Personally, I would have designed SR to show all digits right from its conception.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I am glad the problem is solved and DPR once again shows he is listening to the concerns on the forums.
