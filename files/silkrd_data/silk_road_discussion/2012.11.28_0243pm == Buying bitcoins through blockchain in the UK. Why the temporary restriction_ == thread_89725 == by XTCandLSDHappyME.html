				I understand why there is a £10 limit for buying bitcoins on blockchain either with bank deposit or barclays pingit. It says &quot;Due to exchange issues we are currently low on bitcoins. The £500 limit will be restored shortly&quot;<br /><br />Does anybody know if this has happened before and if so how long was the restriction there for? I just wanna buy some coins god dammit!

				Yeah, I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s been happening quite often recently!<br /><br />It can take anywhere from a few days to even a week + sadly.<br /><br />Quite an irritating thing, glad that I&#039;ve spent an excessive amount recently - don&#039;t trust Royal Mail over December.<br /><br />makku

				It will only let you make a £10 purchase per 7 days! It says the £500 limit will be restored soon. God I hope its ok by tomorrow! Argh! So makku how long does it normally take then? Few days to a week? Fuck!&nbsp; :&#039;(

Sadly there is no way to know unless we could get an inside source from Blockchain haha.<br /><br />makku

				Their public reason is their supposed lack of bitcoins however I think the true reason is that the reward total for &#039;mining&#039; a block was 50 coins and only just today that got halved to 25 coins which will push up the price of bitcoins. Makes sense for them to limit the amount outgoing until the price jump. Should be sorted by early december when they have a more confident price.
