				Hi,<br /><br />a customer of mine hasn&#039;t hit the &#039;received&#039; button and won&#039;t reply to any of my messages. <br /><br />It has just past the &#039;auto-finalise&#039; time which I assumed would just literally &#039;auto-finalise&#039; but it now says &#039;auto-finalise 2 hours pastdue&#039;..<br /><br />Will it ever automatically release the coins to me? I&#039;m almost certain the customer has received the goods and is just holding out on me.<br /><br />Regards.

				What a pain in the ass right?<br />Its 20 days 6 hours then it will finalize.<br /><br />There is no telling what the buyers problem is though. Hopefully not some stupid kid buying BTC on his parents credit card.

				yes, autofinalize releases btc to the seller after 20 days, 6 hours.&nbsp; The auto-finalize counts down to 0 at 20 days, then says &quot;overdue x hours&quot; up to 6 hours, when the BTC are released.<br /><br />I&#039;m a seller - this drives me nuts.&nbsp; Customers need to finalize as soon as they have the product in their hands, and leave a review in the forums if they feel like being the awesomeness, too.
