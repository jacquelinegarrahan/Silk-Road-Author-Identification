				That happens when Firefox automatically inserts a &#039;www&#039; into the hostname after it fails to load the first time. Simply remove the www and try again, not that it will work right this moment. SR appears to be down again.

				Just came back after a several month recoup t-break/forgetting what withdrawals feel like. Hope its not down for good this is my only hook-up for quality shit at semi reasonable prices easily.... I don&#039;t mind spending the money because the product on here is leterally everything the best in the world not just your region. And its easy to expliot regional trends. Like pills to smack in middle america away from west coast where people speak of like LSD back in 05-06.

I don&#039;t think the intention of the down-time was to add performance to support more users necessarily, correct? I don&#039;t know if DPR has really commented on that.<br /><br />I imagine it is difficult for one man, who we only know as DPR, to lie to everyone he knows and sees daily and sit in a server room for hours upon hours fixing and upgrading his side project. Thats right, I imagine Silk Road is esentially a side project for DPR. How else could it exist? He sure as shit doesn&#039;t tell everyone he&#039;s going to work 9 to 5 Monday through Friday at Illegal Drugs International Inc.<br /><br />He does make money, presumably a lot of money from Silk Road. There is incentive for him to keep it up and running, but it isn&#039;t as easy as sitting down and hammering out a solution in two days like he were clocking in to work.<br /><br />In any case I think you&#039;re right the servers are getting hit a bit more by the existing user base, but I don&#039;t think that means new users shouldn&#039;t be allowed. These issues will likely eventually all be sorted out, but it will be tough going for a little bit longer.<br /><br />The best case scenario may be that things are pretty much back to normal in a couple days, but I wouldn&#039;t expect a blazing fast browsing and searching experience, and hopefully DPR can use this as a learning experience. Maybe when it does come time to upgrade performance DPR will have a better idea how to implement the down time and be up and running again sooner. I&#039;m sure it isn&#039;t an easy task.<br /><br />To limit the user base isn&#039;t a great idea in my mind. DPR would be incentivizing competition, which could be a good thing in itself. Less users would also means less incentive for DPR to work at all costs to maintain his side project though.
