				I just discovered SR a couple weeks ago and it looks awesome. I decided to check out the forums beforehand to read up on everything and I think I&#039;ve got the general gist of how everything works. I got some BTC transferred into my account a few hours ago, and was in the checkout process for my first order and was pretty excited about it. But, during the time it took for me to encrypt my address in GPU, the value of my BTC went from $48 to $42 (and still dropping) so, I didn&#039;t have enough funds anymore, haha. My logic was to just have enough BTC in my SR account for an 1/8 and not leave funds sitting around in there. Lesson learned to drop a few extra BTC for fluctuations next time. :P<br /><br />Since I couldn&#039;t place my order, thought I&#039;d drop by here to introduce myself. From many of the threads I&#039;ve read, the community seems to be full of nice and helpful people. Looking forward to meeting some cool people and doing business. :)

				Yeah I had to learn that too about the bitcoin values.&nbsp; Fortunately I still had just enough to place my first order when the value dropped in a matter of hours.&nbsp; I am now not so patiently waiting for that first package to arrive.&nbsp; Good luck fellow newbie!

				I&#039;ll have to wait a few days for my next BTC deposit to come through, hopefully it won&#039;t drop any more since I&#039;m anxious to make my first purchase, hehe.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5468.msg46566#msg46566">Quote from: oppyate on November 15, 2011, 01:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You happen to know what kind of piece that is in the pic?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m no gun expert, but I think it&#039;s a M1911.

				Heh, I sorta did the same thing, except instead of misjudging the value fluctuation, I didn&#039;t realize that shipping is often not included in the cost.&nbsp; So I was about 1.5 BTC off what I had anticipated the price of my first order to be.&nbsp; Took me about another four days to add more funds (BTC is a pain in the ass when you&#039;re excited and impatient.)<br /><br />In the end though, I spent more time on the forums, and discovered that if I&#039;d gone with my original plan I would&#039;ve probably gotten scammed.&nbsp; All&#039;s well that ends well, I guess.<br />

				Rather than waiting a few days for my BTC transfer, I just placed an order that was slightly cheaper. Partially because the value of BTC keeps dipping and because I was a little impatient, lol.<br /><br />I do agree, it&#039;s given a lot of time to do more research on the forums, so it&#039;s a win/win.

				Hello everyone. Im fairly new to this forum but definitely not drugs or Bitcoin. hope to have an overall good experience here and maybe even make a friend or two. I figured this would be a good thread to introduce myself as i found my self in the same exact position as OP. also wondering how important is the PGP encryption process to everyone. i noticed some sellers require it wile others dont really care but ask that you be discreet in your messages. i figure if i do my research and i trsut the seller is there any reason to encrypt the message? as a new user getting ready to make his first order (a 35$ eight of Kush ;)) i want to make sure i do everything right and as politely as possible. thanks to anyone willing to help us newbies here.<br /><br />

				Hello hippy and welcome. I think if a seller provides a PGP key to use, why not use it? Better to be safer than sorry I say, since it takes less than a minute to encrypt a message. If you can be discreet in a PM guess it&#039;s not really required but I&#039;d atleast use it to encrypt my addy in an order.<br /><br />This is pulled directly from the SR buyer&#039;s guide:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From the moment you submit your order, to the moment it is displayed to your vendor, the information is fully encrypted and totally unreadable. Then, as soon as your vendor marks your package with the address and confirms shipment, the address is deleted forever and is unretreavable. For the extra cautious, you can encrypt your information yourself with your vendor&#039;s public key so that even we at Silk Road would be unable to view it, even if we wanted to.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So, I&#039;d do it just for the extra peace of mind of knowing my communication with a seller stays between the both of us.

				you do bring up good points Sob. Ive never used PGP before so I was hoping it was something i might not have to learn. but your right better safe than sorry so i suppose im gonna try to figure it out before i place that order in my cart. im sure theres a tut somewhere on this forum that i can use to help.

				There&#039;s a sticky on the security forum with a tutorial. It&#039;s pretty straight-forward, got it setup in a couple minutes. You can also check it out here by the same author, shepj.<br /><br />http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/guides/shepj.html

				I agree with sobchak: if it&#039;s there, I use it, but if not, I don&#039;t...I doubt it will stop much bad shit from happening, but it makes me feel better, and it&#039;s not a bad idea to learn anyway.&nbsp; If the vendor takes the time to do it, I use it.
