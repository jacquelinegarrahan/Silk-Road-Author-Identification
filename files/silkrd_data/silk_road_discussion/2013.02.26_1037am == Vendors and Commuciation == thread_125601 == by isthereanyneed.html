				I think this is the most important part of being a successful vendor, its a good idea to have a good product and stealth too of course but all the rest revolves around communication in my opinion.<br /><br />If I am on the look for a new product naturally I want to know a bit about the product first, shipping success if O/S, maybe ask if there are any deals at higher quantities (Oz&#039;s), a little info about the product that sort of thing and a lot of vendors miss their chance of getting my business by not replying or when they do its some sorry excuse for an answer like &#039;&#039;Yes no problem&#039;&#039;<br /><br />What happens when they don&#039;t reply or take a few days? Well we go else where and we forget about the vendor that took forever to reply or never replied at all and we spend all our btc that are burning a massive hole in our wallets else where........,and&nbsp; this is how you loose customers!<br /><br />Even with vendors that I have used before if they take a few days replying or don&#039;t reply then they potentially loose the sale, if it were me I would log into to sr twice a day and reply to every ones message no matter how big or small, just seems lazy and silly as you could be earning a lot more if some of you vendors had some one manning the phones!<br /><br />Communication is key.......:)

				we struggle with this.&nbsp; i know feeling informed is one of the top kinds of security for overseas customers.&nbsp; we try to always inform when we need info or when items are shipped out.&nbsp; it is not always easy.&nbsp; sometimes you get busy and somehow one slips between the cracks.

I the other 10%? You wouldn&#039;t believe some of the crazy shit people send me when they are on drugs, and then there are the people that think I&#039;m their new best friend because I answered their question and drag on a conversation for over a week and about 20 messages. After a year it starts to get old and I start to dread even logging on some days but I need the money since I can&#039;t get a job because the economy is the shits. But all in all, it has been an adventure and I can brag to my grand kids someday when drugs are legal that I was part of the revolution way back when adults weren&#039;t aloud to make their own decisions on what they did and did not do.<br /><br />VIVA REVOLUTION!<br />

				lol I can imagine people off their nut on molly pestering you for a chewing gum to be sent out express delivery :)<br /><br />No my questions are always relevant and they are always leading up to the sale but if you ignore them you dont get the sale, prime example a hash vendor did not reply and he lost out on a $200 sale. Ive went else where, all I wanted to know was if the hash bubbles and what is the most you can send at once.<br /><br />Other times its questions about basic things but things you need to know especially with O/S.

				Communication is very important in my opinion. As a new vendor, I answer all questions and mails fairly promptly and hopefully, concisely as well :) I can imagine for some of the bigger vendors, it would be fairly time consuming to reply to all the messages they get. Whereas, small fries like me, appreciate a sale more, so try harder to make that sale. That is the same for most businesses I reckon? <br /><br />Some of the questions I get asked are ridiculous, not to mention some of the requests! I&#039;m very happy to be here though :)
