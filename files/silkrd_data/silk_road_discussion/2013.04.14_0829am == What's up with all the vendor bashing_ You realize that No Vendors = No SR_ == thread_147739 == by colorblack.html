				Is it me or is there an inordinate amount of anti-vendor gibberish filling up these forums lately? Every day theres 5 or more new threads complaining about something the &quot;evil vendors&quot; are doing. <br />I hope you all realize that its the vendors who supply US (buyers) with things that are hard to come by. There is no shortage of buyers/$, but there is a shortage of vendors. If vendors started packing up and calling it quits, YOU would suffer. SR would suffer. While I understand there are vendors that pull bullshit, there&#039;s far more buyers that try to pull some kind of stunt and game the system. That&#039;s just the nature of the beast. We must realize that these are people who are taking a risk (more risk then buyers.. with buyers there is plausible deniability.. but if a vendor gets caught with 10 packages of coke and pills on his way to the PO there ain&#039;t no fucking get out of jail free card!) to provide US with drugs to our doorstep. Why act entitled to the drugs or demand to be treated like a high roller in a Vegas casino and the vendor is some lowly casino host? Christ! I suggest if you have an issue with a vendor try your best to resolve it over PM on the main site and don&#039;t come into the forums crying bloody murder until/unless you&#039;ve exhausted all options. Quite frankly my vendors are fucking awesome, they always hook me up, I&#039;ve never had an issue, and I certainly wouldn&#039;t bitch about it on the forums unless I exhausted every possibly private option.

Too many people take this place for granted and either A) don&#039;t realize or B) don&#039;t care about the risk involved for vendors. They&#039;ve become so accustomed to being able to order drugs anonymously and have them shipped right to their fucking front door that they have lost perspective of what is really going on here. If a vendor wants to take down his listings, for ANY reason, he has every right to do so and doesn&#039;t owe one single person an explanation. For many vendors, this is their livelihood. So, if they feel it&#039;s in their best interest to law low for a while, that&#039;s what they do. If that means some kid doesn&#039;t get to drop his acid or smoke his weed for a few days, well, too fucking bad. They&#039;re providing YOU the service, and are under no contract or obligation to do so.

				Couldn&#039;t have said it better myself.. Everyone is crying like &#039;I lost $50 when a vendor cancelled my order&nbsp; :&#039;(&#039; What they don&#039;t realise is that the vendor might have had 20 orders where he was losing $100 per order, meaning a total loss of $2000. <br /><br />So us vendors are meant to lose out on a bunch of cash and risk our asses sending buyers drugs as well. And then we get bad mouthed for it. <br /><br />This community slowly shifting in a bad direction... And ut&#039;s the BTC fault.. People are getting greedy.

				Wow .&nbsp; Well said. You guys say it well.<br /><br />This is a friggin priveledge not a right.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t abuse it or expect shit for free because of a site calculation error. <br />&nbsp;I offered to pay half the difference on my last order and the vendors both said its ok anyway and put it in transit.&nbsp; . There&#039;s some real troopers here.&nbsp; For that I agreed to spend twice the amount this week. <br /><br />&nbsp;I wish others would see it this way too.&nbsp; I see it as:&nbsp; I saved my life not hitting the streets for drugs today, delivered to my doorstep, no Cost of gas driving around looking for drugs all night long , getting ripped off, risk of getting pulled over , etc. .&nbsp; .&nbsp; this is fucking paradise. The only risk is walking to my fucking mailbox for a few feet.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Bitcoin greed indeed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				Good point. The money I save on gas alone by shopping here is worth every penny.<br />I spend more than shipping on just one ride to a dealers house IRL.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for me, I&nbsp; come on top shopping here.&nbsp; I bet others do too.<br />

				&nbsp;I agree with your post, although I don&#039;t put vendors on quite as high a pedestal as you do.&nbsp; <br />At the end of the day they are just business people.&nbsp; They don&#039;t take the risk for me, they take the risk for profit.<br /><br /><br />And I think the buyer takes a significant portion of the risk,&nbsp; after all, they are the one receiving the package.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first time you order from any vendor, you are rolling the dice re: stealth.&nbsp; After all, there is not a single vendor profile that says &quot;mediocre product w/ crappy stealth&quot;&nbsp; Pretty much every vendor touts &quot;Best stealth on SR!&quot;<br /><br />So you have to read reviews, talk to other buyers on the forums, and learn the basic rules on SR.&nbsp; I think that is where a lot of new users fail.&nbsp; Then they come to the forums to complain, mostly because they did not do their homework.<br /><br /><br />There is the flip side as well though, where users are aggressively trying to out scam vendors.&nbsp; Some of those threads are extremely useful.<br /><br />But for the most part I think you are right.&nbsp; A lot of the user base does not seem to grasp where they are (black market) and what they are doing (buying illegal goods)<br /><br />For me, this is the best option I have had for hooking up in 20 years.&nbsp; The last thing I plan on doing is coming to the forums and pissing all over the entire concept before I have even read the wiki.<br />&nbsp;

				Well of course, it goes both ways. If a vendor behaves like an asshole, he doesn&#039;t get my bitcoin and shouldn&#039;t get yours too. BUT, that being said.. let&#039;s face it. The buyer does NOT have the same risk that vendors have on their shoulders. You think LE/dea/fbi are looking for buyers on here? Fuck no! I&#039;ts already been discussed ad nauseum.. but it&#039;s safe to say that LE is actively working to target vendors, not buyers. LE are posing as buyers for sure. Many vendors have, I&#039;m sure, unknowingly vended to federal agents. How scary is that? And the vendors know it. They&#039;re protected by the anonymous nature of this thing. But if they get pulled over for a traffic violation and by some fluke get busted with YOUR drugs all packaged up in envelopes, THEY go to jail NOT you. That&#039;s a massive risk. I know I would never have the nerves to take it.<br /><br />Aside from the occasional newbie coming in here and claiming a vendor scammed him (which I am not counting), we have active users vendor bashing and a lot of it has to do with bitcoin greed. Pure and simple. Ponder this: when BTC were going up, buyers holding their coins and not buying.. which.. is fair game. BUT, when your vendor throws in an extra gram/pill/etc/freebie with your order, do you come to the forums and start screaming &quot;OMG THIS VENDOR SCREWED ME OVER THEY GAVE ME MORE THEN WHAT I PAID FOR!!!! THIS GUY IS SHAMELES!!&quot;? No! You happily take the extra product. But when a vendor cancels your $60 order (and remember, you haven&#039;t LOST anything until you cash the BTC out for money. Hold your coin and the values will go back to where it was when you placed your order in a few days.. trust me) because they could be potentially losing thousands on those orders... it&#039;s the end of the world. Now true, cancelling an order after it&#039;s been made is a grey area and I&#039;d work it out with the vendor privately. But all this bullshit about &quot;putting vendors on a list&quot; who have yanked their listings, LOL!! Are you serious? What if vendors put buyers on a list of those who don&#039;t &quot;buy every week&quot;?<br /><br /><br />And to the guy who said vendors work for profit not for us - very true. Vendors are in this for profit. We&#039;re in this to get drugs delivered to our mailboxes at the click of a few buttons. If these vendors start packing up and leaving and you&#039;re forced to score drugs back IRL, it&#039;s going to be a rude awakening. Theres no plausible deniability IRL, theres no anonymity, theres no resolution center, theres no feedback. Theres just you handing over your cash to some homeboy as he goes into a shady as apartment building and hoping he returns (or much worse scenarios). <br />

				7/10 of this forum is unneeded, which allows alot of room for bullshit and lies.<br />There&#039;s alternative s to SR which the vendors are finding out about and the freemarket demanded it now now it the birth of a true freemarket.<br />If you have to ask you probably cant get thru registration on them anyway.<br />Less bullshit equals happy vendors and customers.

A reckless buyer is a risk to themself. A reckless vendor is a risk to everyone.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to belabor this, because the vendor in question is usually reliable, but I just had a package stinking of weed delivered to my home. Who assumes that risk? Who gets fucked for that? Carelessness by vendors results in risks to buyers that have *nothing* to do with risks that vendors assume by being in business, and that&#039;s what generates vendor bashing, along with things like FE pressure tactics to cover reckless vending. Miss-spelled names, errors in addresses. I must have a god-damned horseshoe up my ass, because it&#039;s a miracle none of this has burned me yet. The star vendors I deal with have not one bad word said about them in the forums, except for nakedly transparent scam attempts by total noobs, and if they were the only ones vending on SR, it would be a better place, not worse, and certainly not over. I just looked for an established vendor&#039;s review thread to shower them with praise but they don&#039;t have one. They don&#039;t need one. To the forums, they are almost invisible. And when I find one I hang on for dear life, because trying new vendors is risky fucking business unless you&#039;ve got layers of protection and fakery many can&#039;t arrange.<br /><br />Now that&#039;s usually the case. The BTC fluctuations really brought the entitled pricks out of the woodwork, that&#039;s for sure. A lot of very un-righteous bashing, and it is very ugly, though again it is also very transparent. I recall early on in my SR experience stumbling on a (notorious) feud between two vendors, and what am I to make of this? I swear them both off. I can&#039;t tell who is right and don&#039;t need the drama. Well, one of them is now the above-mentioned vendor I wanted to praise, but it just goes to show the damage that unsubstantiated mudslinging can do.

				You know what, I&#039;m not going to edit my post because I want to own up to this, but that was overly harsh. I&#039;m still bent out of shape about the recent mishandled package. If your point is that, however justified previous vendor complaints were, the new trend is unjustified and troubling? Then I agree.<br /><br />The &quot;look at the risks vendors take&quot; argument still doesn&#039;t fly with me, though, because as noted the arrow of risk goes from vendor to buyer and not the other way around. Buyers on SR are at the mercy of vendors in a way that is absolutely not the case in reverse. Risk in real life dealing is far more two-way, which actually means it&#039;s unequal given the harsher penalties for distribution vs possession.<br /><br />Maybe as SR continues on in the spotlight it is also suffering from Eternal September issues. I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t like to reflexively reach for Get Off My Lawn type answers.<br /><br /><br />
