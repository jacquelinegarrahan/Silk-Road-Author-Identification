				In this thread i&#039;d like to invite vendors and forum members who might hustle in real life to share tips and tricks on keeping safe and evading LE. I&#039;ll start with a few things I like to do, as i&#039;ve managed to do this for almost a decade now without a single criminal conviction on my record.<br /><br />1. Be wary of the possibility of phone taps, and bugs in your house and car.<br />Goes without saying but a lot of people forget these basic precautions. I always pretend there&#039;s a bug in my house and on my phone, and that the cops are listening to everything I say in my car as well. When people come over and I need to have a drug related conversation I always get them to leave their phone inside my house (and mine as well) and then I walk outside with them and do a lap around the block while we talk business. I also refuse to talk about drugs inside any vehicle or in the vicinity of any vehicle (as bugs in vehicles can pick up things you say around them). On the phone I never send any messages that doesn&#039;t have a reasonable non-drug-related explanation as to why I sent it, I never refer to drugs or money, and I never use anyone&#039;s real name or any real locations. Me and my friends name locations after bars and restaurants in my city, so if the cops listened to any of my phone conversations it would go something like this:<br /><br />&quot;Hey man, what&#039;s up?&quot;<br />&quot;Not much man, did you want to catch up and have a drink?&quot;<br />&quot;Sure bro where do you wanna go?&quot;<br />&quot;How about the Murphy&#039;s Tavern in 20 minutes?&quot; (Code for a location we both know)<br />&quot;Sweet see you soon&quot;<br />&quot;Bye&quot;<br /><br />Then we do all the talking in person. I also take the extra precaution of regularly changing my phone number, not saving any messages in my phone and having my phone registered in a fake name with a sim-card that&#039;s also registered in a fake name. If there&#039;s any other communication that needs to be done (such as if i&#039;m on holiday) with my runners I use tormail.<br /><br />2. Don&#039;t keep any drugs in your house.<br />Even if you have to walk 30 minutes and bury them in a forest, NEVER KEEP DRUGS IN YOUR HOUSE. 95% of people get snapped because they have shit at their house and it gets raided. If you have a rule of never sleeping with drugs in your house you literally make yourself 95% less likely to get snapped. Some good options are using a storage shed in someone elses name, keeping them in a safe at a friends house, keeping them in a secretly parked non-suss car registered in someone elses name and the good old-fashioned burying them.<br /><br />3. Never trust anyone more than you have too.<br />If someone doesn&#039;t need to know something, don&#039;t tell it to them. No-one likes to hear you brag about making thousands of dollars a week and it will just make them jealous and shitty at you, you gain nothing from opening your mouth and it just gives them more shit to rat on you about if they ever get caught. Always think &#039;Does this person absolutely NEED to know this?&quot;. If they don&#039;t, keep it a secret.<br /><br />4. Look inconspicuous and don&#039;t get in fights.<br />Violence attracts police attention, so avoid it as much as possible. It&#039;s always the drug kingpins who commit murders that you read about in the papers. Also, dress in a manner that allows you to walk past a group of cops without them looking at you twice. I personally have no tattoos or piercings, i&#039;m fit but I don&#039;t take steroids so i&#039;m not excessively big, and I have normal hair and wear nice clothes that are classy but not expensive enough to turn heads. I also keep jewelery to a minimum and avoid wearing rolex&#039;s or lots of gold around my neck, and I avoid scowling at people or acting in a big-headed manner when I go about my day-to-day affairs. Think of the guy in &#039;Breaking Bad&#039; who works at the fast-food place and looks like an ordinary guy but secretly controls half the meth trade in his state. You want to look as normal and innocent as possible, and if police ever randomly stop you or look at you when you walk past them you are doing something wrong.<br /><br />5. Don&#039;t ever dog.<br />Goes without saying. If you dog on other dealers you deserve to rot in hell. You made the choice to deal, so if shit hits the fan you keep your mouth shut and never write statements on other people.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got heaps more tips i&#039;ve picked up over the years I can share but i&#039;d love some personal input from you guys first so I can learn a bit as well. Please don&#039;t hold back!

I&#039;m providing general advice only to help keep people safe from law enforcement and inviting others to do the same. And you can&#039;t say that people should learn on their own, this is not an industry you should learn through trial-and-error!<br /><br />Just to be safe I posted this from a throwaway account anyway, and other vendors can of course do the same if they like as well.

				Not to be a jerk or anything, we&#039;re having a discussion, a little civil discourse, yes?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t feel the need to tell every Tom, Dick &amp; Harry who comes on here how to vend.&nbsp; Quoting thecrackhead, in his Spare Coin thread,&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel the need to help the &quot;aliens, feds and pope&quot; either. This is a dangerous game with potentially life-altering consequences.&nbsp; In my view, people have either got what it takes to vend, meaning they already have most of it figured out already, or they don&#039;t. <br /><br />Asking a specific question to overcome a specific issue is one thing but I see no need to publish a How To Guide for LE to use against us, which is what this thread has the potential to do.<br /><br />Sorry, this is how I feel.&nbsp; This kind of discussion is not a good idea. <br /><br />Cheers, carry on ... bbfn<br />

				The best thing to do, What I do is promote parties and invite only people we know. Same people every week. About 250 t0 300 people partys.Most people have lots of money. Still RL hustling is always a challenge, but the money is really good.
