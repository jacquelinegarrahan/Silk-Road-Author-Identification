				Most of us here would identify as libertarians or anarchists. I hate labels, but if you have to go with something this would be the most accurate description. <br /><br />What I&#039;ve found extremely schizoid during the last week of SR &quot;troubles&quot; is that so many people were staunchly against the competition, namely BMR and Atlantis. They even went that far to blacklist SR vendors selling on these sites. Are you for the free market or monopolization of darknet drug trade? As long as LE and the mainstream media have one &quot;culprit&quot; to pinpoint it is going to be very hard if not impossible to get through this and continue the revolution.<br /><br />I understand that many of you are emotionally attached to SR. SR and DPR and all the other pioneers have been paramount in starting a revolution, but we have to realize that this revolution is much bigger than SR, and it is beyond SR. <br /><br />Healthy free market should encourage competition - the bad apples will be weeded out soon, and we&nbsp; will get lower prices, better stealth and most importantly DECENTRALIZATION. Imagine if there were dozens of SRs out there. What could LE and the mainstream media do about it? They could suck our cocks, and this would make them completely disarmed.<br /><br />They way things are going SR is going to be swallowed up by the attacks, media scrutiny and LE within 6-12 months.&nbsp; We could prevent this by fragmenting&nbsp; SR into a several different sites, and then into dozens niche site. It&#039;s like a game of chess - you anticipate your opponent&#039;s move, and act accordingly before hand.<br /><br />I just want to note, that I have never used other sites besides SR, and will continue to do so for the time being. People, we must not get emotional at this particular moment - we need cool heads and we need to make this transition from SR to various niche sites in a timely and proper manner. We have no choice. What else is there to do when SR being down is discussed on BBC website and other MM outlets.<br /><br />The genie is out of the bottle. SR, DPR and other pioneers should be commended for what they have done - started the revolution. But this revolution is way bigger than SR and we must let the free market rule !<br /><br />If you want to refute my arguments here, I would encourage you to do it. Bring it on: critiques, opinions, ideas, brainstormings. It&#039;s time to get proactive and do something about the current situation. Sitting on our asses expecting this to&nbsp; correct itself would bring the downfall of unimaginable proportions and many vendors and buyers would feel the consequences quite profoundly.<br /><br /><br />Peace,

				Well said, Babyshiva.<br /><br />SR really is an amazing place and is blazing the trail for truly free markets. Not only is it to be commended, it has secured its place in the history books.<br /><br />Others will, and are, following. BMR, Atlantis, and others to come. The competition is healthy providing that the competitors don&#039;t resort to dirty tricks to get their footholds. I sincerely hope that competitors are not in any way responsible for these attacks because that would fly in the face of Laissez-faire capitalism and ultimately damage the economy as a whole. Quality of product and service, and price are the real drivers of economic progress, not mafia tactics of beating up the competition or protection rackets.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s time for SR to bow out of the race at all. It might still be the biggest kid on the block but at the same time it is in its infancy and its continued evolution can still serve as a model for those that are following in its footsteps. Government is not the only factor that threatens these free markets. There is a danger of internal rot due to scammers and selective scammers, and this danger could destroy the marketplace. <br /><br />Just my 1 Satori&#039;s worth :)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Victimized buy its own success you say?&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty intelligent of you, nice one.<br /><br />I agree too.&nbsp; As something like this grows, so must the infrastructure.&nbsp; It can&#039;t be a pirate party forever.&nbsp; Sooner or later we need to add more equipment.&nbsp; Weather its servers or bathrooms/plumbing, every business grows.&nbsp; It seems we can&#039;t grow past a certain point or else DPR looses his security or foothold.&nbsp; There is an obvious reluctance to grow the infrastructure.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there is a very good reason for this that is none of my business to ask.<br /><br />Decentralization is the answer, but it also presents huge risks for the boss.&nbsp; He would have to let go of all control at some point, or step out of the bushes.&nbsp; Its not worth it and it makes good sense to just let it ride as long as you can.&nbsp; OF course, this is all speculation, discussion and no fact whatsoever.&nbsp; I&#039;m a stoner and everything I write is just for open discussion.

My issue is that we would have to protect the revolution by anticipating what is most likely to happen and then act accordingly before it actually occurs. Otherwise we would experience an massive &quot;downfall&quot; , for the lack of better term. <br /><br />As for DPR and control. He/she is an very intelligent and wise person, and I am completely certain that DPR was aware from the very beginnings that SR would have to transform at some point. As far as I can see it DPR is not in it only for the money, and in order for the revolution to grow and continue, it is self evident that DPR would have to cease certain aspects of control. This would be best done under controlled circumstances rather then in panic mode, when shit hits the fan.<br /><br />Peace,

				Open competition is an unbeatable force of progress. Just look at evolution -- &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is useless without decay of the weakest.

				There isn&#039;t much competition huh?&nbsp; Everyone is so loyal to this site. They will sit and wait for the store to open again rather than shop elsewhere. <br /><br />Interesting fanaticism <br /><br />I&#039;m one&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

				Great post shiva!<br /><br />I agree wholeheartedly. I think, as you mentioned, it can be hard to rally behind these niche sites when they aren&#039;t led by someone so motivated and true to their ideals as DPR is. Truly a one of a kind leader who inspires many of us.<br /><br />To encompass his ideals and vision though, we need to recognize the advantages competing markets bring in a decentralized dark-web community. More competition allows competing sites to continually try and best the other (hard for vendors/admins, great for customers), vendors who may be drowned out in one market may thrive in another, diverting and spreading LE&#039;s attention and resources, more options to remain anonymous, and plenty more which helps to strengthen the beliefs DPR so strongly advocates for such as agorism/decentralization/libertarianism/freemarkets/all these words are the same. :)<br /><br />So be wary of competitors, but don&#039;t write them off and consider the positives alternative free markets present. And as shiva has said, to truly be a part of DPR&#039;s vision we must remember this revolution is much bigger than SR alone!!<br /><br />

				It&#039;s all about Litecoin. It isn&#039;t just coincidence that all of this started when LC made its promotional push, and that MtGox&#039; reaction has been the opposite of what it should be under these circumstances. (BTW, Litecoin has doubled since this started).

				There are great points in this thread.&nbsp; Personally, I am not going anywhere, but I don&#039;t have a problem with anyone who samples teh wares of another exchange. <br />&nbsp;<br />The main problem I have is that if this is an attack on SR and not just tor in general, it can&#039;t be a coincidence that it came about at roughly the same time atlantis did.&nbsp; okay, it is *possible*, but the little conspiracy guy in my brain won&#039;t let it go.&nbsp; In any case,bI&#039;m stubborn and don&#039;t comply well.&nbsp; This is why I&#039;m not abandoning ship. <br /><br />DPR has no problem with atlantis, afaik, but I bet they&#039;d strangle the attackers if they could get their hooks in them(god, that&#039;d be messy).&nbsp; <br />Hey! I have a new saying: Messier than a pirate trying to strangle someone. :D <br />....okay, no one will understand that. :L<br /><br />now i have to find out what a litecoin is.... I keep hearing that word.&nbsp;

As some people in other threads pointed out - what is something happens to DPR? God forbid, but we need to put this into the equation as well. <br /><br />Just look what happened in the 60s with Leary being the posterboy for LSD revolution. They took him down, discredited him, killed his reputation and public person (although he made the job easy for them with the Church of LSD and all the rest). <br /><br />DECENTRALIZATION is the key. This is something that cannot be easily refute. I encourage many bright people here to try and refute the decentralization argument. <br /><br />Peace,
