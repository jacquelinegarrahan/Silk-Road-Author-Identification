				For those with more advanced understanding of legal issues.<br />Are we engaging in the legal definition of conspiracy by helping <br />each other on this forum? <br /><br />If so, what can we do to insulate ourselves?

				Good question<br /><br />Aside from using TOR - is there any kind of encryption or security measures implemented on this forum? Anything at all or is it just TOR? If that is the case&nbsp; :-\

				Creating multiple usernames, maybe? Maybe have one username for each thread/topic. Honestly, this is just a forum. No business is conducted here. Its on the market where most of the security should be implemented. Just do as mseller recommends. Don&#039;t say too much and&nbsp; be general/vague. Don&#039;t give out locations, Dates, times, names, shipping methods, bitcoin transaction numbers, DCN&#039;s etc. nothing to give out your identity or identity of other members. Only post relevant things. I think if you follow those rules, you should be ok...

				Indeed. Just stay on topic - and don&#039;t post anything linking you to yourself. <br />If worried chat using a different name then what you bought under so lets chance of connection. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Usually LE needs two forms of communication to prove conspiracy.&nbsp; Eg text message and F2F, or email and phone call.

				Three people willing to testify you were planning a criminal activity is enough evidence for conspiracy as well.

				I imagine it has to do with what is being discussed.&nbsp; Someone saying, I can supply this illegal item to everyone possibly could be considered conspiracy.&nbsp; A seller explaining how to ship something under the radar could possibly too.&nbsp; A lot of it probably has to do with the context used and what exactly takes place in the discussion.&nbsp; I doubt explaining how people use a drug or harm prevention could be, but even so someone explaining how they plan to use a drug in the near future could be.&nbsp; People used to use the SWIM method when explaining things on various forums to avoid the conspiracy aspect but that really did not work out so well for a number of reasons, not going to explain them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Reading the forum alone definitely cannot be considered conspiracy but if someone were to get pinched for something else, prosecution could use the fact that you visit such a forum against you.&nbsp; Ex: Bob gets caught smoking weed and pleads not guilty, prosecution shows that Bob visits drug forums so the jury and/or judge are easily convinced that Bob would not visit drug forums unless he were involved with drugs.&nbsp; Of course Bob&#039;s lawyer could dispute the fact that reading about drugs does not always mean use, sale or manufacture, like in the instance of law enforcement or news reporters, but the prosecution doesn&#039;t care.&nbsp; Their only job is to make you look as bad as they can to at least shock the jury/judge into a guilty verdict if their evidence won&#039;t stand up.<br /><br />In forums people should avoid discussing:<br />&nbsp;-Plans to make an illegal drug.<br />&nbsp;-Offers of drugs for sale<br />&nbsp;-Offers to buy drugs<br />&nbsp;-How to illegally ship an item<br />&nbsp;-How they use drugs<br />&nbsp;-How they plan to use a drug<br />&nbsp;-How to make a drug<br />&nbsp;-How SWIM makes this and that<br />&nbsp;-What drugs you own

				^^^Thats why you be vague. Never say &quot; I have ten pounds of such an such, How do I iv it?&quot; instead, you would say &quot;I&#039;ve heard that you can do such and such with this, is this correct? any advice?&quot; That way you aren&#039;t implicating yourself in anything.<br /><br />there are a lot of other forums, like poppies.org, opiophile, bluelight, etc that is in clearnet (they talk about much more and with much more detail than here) I have never heard anyone get into trouble. (not saying that nobody has) just don&#039;t implicate yourself or others. Never mention any specif items that could identify you or others in any way. It&#039;s not that hard.

Anything at all or is it just TOR? If that is the case&nbsp; :-\<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are a fuckTON of security measures you can implement if you have moderate computer skills and are willing to spend the time setting them up.&nbsp; Some of the basic ones are: TAILS, TrueCrypt and subscribing to a VPN.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to be too harsh, but people should just do them, or at least read about them on internet security boards and then decide, rather than making it seem like we&#039;re all out here just waiting to be picked off by LE.&nbsp; If it was that simple, LE would have shut down SR already and busted the 10 top sellers and made sure it was all over the news.&nbsp; I&#039;ve 90% self-educated myself on all the security issues and I have almost zip computer skills.&nbsp; Meaning that if I can do it, then almost anyone can. :)<br />&nbsp;<br />On the other hand, I know a LOT about legal issues and conspiracy.&nbsp; Nearly every person who is brought up on drug charges is also hit with a &quot;possession with intent to distribute&quot; charge and a conspiracy charge.&nbsp; To put a conspiracy charge on an indictment the prosecutor only needs to show that you bought drugs from person X.&nbsp; That&#039;s two people involved and that makes it a conspiracy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Period.&nbsp; So the only people who are bulletproof from conspiracy charges, if they&#039;re caught, are people who come to SR, look around, buy nothing, and don&#039;t say anything on the forums.&nbsp; Sounds like a colossal waste of time to me. :D

				VPN makes TOR less secure.<br />You have moderate computer skills, look it up.<br /><br />I know it was discussed here somewhere.<br />And chaining VPNs is a huge no-no.&nbsp; Nothing looks more suspicious.

				TrueCrypt is very easy to use and a great way to keep files and information protected.<br /><br />Please just don&#039;t start using that SWIM bullshit, its a bunch of nonsense.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, there are a bunch of websites dedicated ti providing drug-related information. But the big difference is they don&#039;t have a &quot;product request&quot; or &quot;product offer&quot; section. I would imagine that these are illegal and could be considered conspiracy, but other drug-talk is merely discussion as long as you don&#039;t mention buying or selling drugs. This is speculation on my part, can anyone confirm or deny it?<br /><br />&nbsp;
