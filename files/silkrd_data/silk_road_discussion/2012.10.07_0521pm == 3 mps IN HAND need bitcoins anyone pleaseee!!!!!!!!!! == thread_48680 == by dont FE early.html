				Anyone remember this thread? http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40351.0<br /><br />Yeah well this is the same old Perky we know and love, the only fair thing to do in this situation is take this young benzo addicts moneypak then proceed to not giving him any coins at all.<br /><br />All his moneypaks are stolen anyway, someone should do the right thing and take his moneypak and donate it to science.

				Hello Perky <br /><br />Instead of all this bullshit just go to sugarmoma next time.<br /><br />And you don&#039;t need to come into the forums and ask some in here to cash a money pack. Anyone you would find in here would just take it. Go to SR and contact the 10+ vendors that take MP&#039;s. Though you would never need to contact 10...Just 1. The first one you contact would take it if it was legit.<br /><br />The only loser in here is you. Everyone is sick of all the threads in all the different forums you have made. There is one forum for this. Use that. <br /><br />And for some reason as I was reading this back I just saw the message before mine from ODB that called this out to be PERKY. I am glad others recognize him so easily.<br /><br />And before you start leaving more messages FE that you are not Perky..DON&#039;T. We know you are and you promised all of us you would quit this bullshit. Just go away and start using another one of your names.

				Yah...&nbsp; Magically, his post in the seller&#039;s forum is removed...<br /><br />And to be nit picky, your sig regarding Amazon vs SR.&nbsp; SR is a marketplace like ebay or craiglist, Amazon is a seller with inventory.&nbsp; SR, of course, never has inventory; it&#039;s a broker at best.&nbsp; &nbsp;
