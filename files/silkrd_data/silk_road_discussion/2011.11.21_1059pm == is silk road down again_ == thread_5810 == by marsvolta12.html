				Down here.

				I was able to log in about 2 times this morning, then nada. Im sure i have orders sitting there, but i cant do a darn thing. What I don&#039;t get is why is the market always having issues but the forum usually is ok? they are both onion sites. I dont know enough technically to know why, but it seems that if one comes up the other should as well..<br /><br />Cp

				Yeah.. I found a work around. Use: https://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.tor2web.org/index.php instead. Just post that link into your Tor browser (keeps you anonymous, so DONT use your normal browser) and wahla.. SR

				Yeah, it sure acts like something is blocking SR specifically, even tho I don&#039;t understand how that could be, but how can other tor sites be connecting fine, but just SR is having these problems...I mean, site isn&#039;t down, I&#039;m in now, but it&#039;s sure out of whack.&nbsp; I was sure it was my IP, finally irritated or pressured into stopping or slowing tor down, but it&#039;s just SR, not even the forums...irritating to get in, see something I need to do, then be unable to reconnect.

				Same problem here - can get on but only load 5-10 pages at best. Could it be down to too much traffic? Also noticed that some products don&#039;t display under listed categories, I can only get to them by pasting links from the forum?? Just put my 1st order through too...

				Members of Silk Road. Here are the know steps to get Silk Road going. (That I know of)<br />First step, let it cycle one time to see if SR loads.<br />If that fails, on the Vidalia Control Panel, find the &quot;Use a New Identity&quot; button. Now try loading the page while cycling through clicking that button and waiting 10 seconds before re-clicks. <br />If this fails, try pasting &quot;http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion&quot; in your Tor browser. Remember not to use that url unless it&#039;s in your secure Tor browser or you won&#039;t be anonymous!<br />If you get a error screen using tor2web.org proxy, try closing the Tor browser completely and trying again.<br /><br />Cycle through these steps continuously until you get in. It may take a couple cycles. (from experience) <br /><br />Happy Silk Roading!! :)
