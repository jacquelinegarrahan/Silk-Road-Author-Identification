				And the first vendor to get you private listings in your time of need is Californication.<br /><br />These seem to be unaffected by the hack and the site is working properly, other than the shipping and images. I still will ask for early finalization, just to be safe, but if you look at my vendor page, you&#039;ll feel very secure in doing that. As soon as the order is finalized, you can know that it will go out as soon as possible. Right now, as a test, I&#039;ll be offering 1/8 and 1/4 oz listings. <br /><br />1/8<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9ce7beec54<br /><br />1/4<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3a3068e01b<br /><br />Lastly, I encourage people to stop freaking out.

				Unfortunately, the Private Listing idea didn&#039;t work. A buyer tried it and the shipping works as normal, but when the order is submitted, the buyer was taken to a blank order page, with no coins removed from his account. I did not receive an order.

Could be a one-off issue?<br />I had made a listing that is public (and has no postage so it isn&#039;t orderable) that just lists all of my stealth listings.<br />I&#039;ve been getting orders just fine. (And no images have been changed since)

				For me, restarting Tor/Vidalia fixed some one-off instances where private listings were not going through successfully. I didn&#039;t think about it at the time but something must have been cached in the browser causing the odd behavior. cached page/session? images? cookies? could have been anything. Glad they are working

				Sorry for the delay in response. Yea, the private listings did end up working; archeanoo was kind enough to help me out with some tests. After he restarted TOR, he was able to successfully buy. Seems to be all good now anyway. Thanks to all!
