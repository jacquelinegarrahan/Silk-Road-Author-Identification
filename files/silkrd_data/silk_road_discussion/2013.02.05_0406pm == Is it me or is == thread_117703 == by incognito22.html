				Heroin and (especially) coke ridiculously expensive on this site?<br /><br />Meanwhile weed you can get much cheaper for than what I can get around here.<br /><br />Shrooms are cheap and LSD is about the same, maybe a little cheaper.<br /><br />overall can&#039;t complain about silk roads prices but the harder drugs seem expensive&nbsp; :o

				It&#039;s you - Here is what you should do - ORDER SOME!&nbsp; Research and find a top vendor, pick up a gram (or even a half gram), then report back.&nbsp; <br /><br />The blow here is as close as you are going to get to pure unless you have a ridiculous local hook up (and I&#039;m not talking about the guy that gets it from a guy that gets it from a guy that gets it from a guy, I&#039;m talking about the guy).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never gotten good blow in person!&nbsp; And I have some of the best connects in my area.&nbsp; I never knew the blow I was getting sucked until I made an order here.&nbsp; In a way, I wish I never picked any up here, then I could still use the local garbage from time to time and enjoy it.&nbsp; As it currently stands, I won&#039;t even do a line if someone offers one at a party - yeah the blow here is that good and worth every penny (if you are getting it from a good vendor).<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I think the trick is, that every different country has products that are cheaper to source, for example for spain it would be weed, hash and opium, for the Netherlands it would be exctacy pills and MDMA, South america it would be cocaine. I think one thing that SR will do over time is to help equalize the cost of drugs across the globe. they might never be exactly the same, due to logistics costs, but you will see reductions in what our community members pay for the harder to get drugs...I guess those drugs with a higher cost are priced like that because they are not represented from source on SR. That said there is one huge benefit to sourcing coke and heroin on here. Quality Quality Quality, in the long run you will be saving money because you wont end up buying a gram of medicated talcon powder in the toilets of your local club at 4am. You know the quality will be good and consistent, so if you look at what you are buying in terms of actual cocaine and heroin and not cutting agents you are actually getting a better deal, in my opinion anyway. Also I have noticed that the drugs with a higher risk attached to them (crystal meth, heroin, crack, coke) have disproportionately higher costs than other drugs, for that reason it is always better to buy bulk and off a trusted seller, as the risk increases so does the price.

Coke in my area is about 10% pure and you are paying 4-50 (GBP) a gram, when on here you are getting 50-70% pure and are paying 80-100 which means you are actually getting more pure cocaine for your money.

				Yeah it is, but look at it from a hand to hand perspective.<br /><br />When an IRL dealer looks his customer in the eye, and they ask, &quot;What&#039;s in it?&quot; To actually know and tell them the truth, you just increased your customer base right there and you will make your money back on sheer VOLUME.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />For personal users, hey, you gotta pay to play and from what I hear, it&#039;s GOOD gear!

If you ever get a look at someones lab results from a criminal case, they usually list the % of alkaloid (at least the two I&#039;ve seen did). The one had the best coke I had ever seen in my life, up to that point, and his was 78%. I later had some off of a brick directly (supposedly) off the boat, and it was hard to snort it and still breath easily. Shit must&#039;ve been 90%+. So, at least in my area, coke is almost half cut, and it cost $200 per 3.5g. I don&#039;t think $500 for a pure 3.5 seems out of sorts.<br /><br />Heroine is almost the same way. I used to sell it ten or twelve years ago. I would buy a ball game (3.5g) and cut it to an ounce. Even then it was still so potent I had to be careful of new jacks. They guy I bought it from told me to cut it 10 times, that&#039;s why it cost $2500. So, if the dope being offered here is cut just enough to keep dummies from lighting themselves up, then it should be well worth the price. For a maintenance user, this should be a dream come true.
