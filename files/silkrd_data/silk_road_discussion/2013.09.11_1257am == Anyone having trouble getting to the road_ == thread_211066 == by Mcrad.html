				You do have to try a number of times sometimes or change identity but it&#039;s not to bad. <br /><br />Its very annoying in the other threads how people are saying they can&#039;t finalize (in 17 days!!!!) because of all the downtime. Like really... you can&#039;t login for 17 days ? Maybe if you try once and it doesn&#039;t work.. then don&#039;t try again for a few days, its possible you wouldn&#039;t be able to login for 17 days. But I bet if people wanted to place an order they would be trying multiple times per minute.<br /><br />Sorry I&#039;m just annoyed.. so many people auto finalize these days ! and its not about restocking or cash flow.. I&#039;m only a small vendor so I don&#039;t need to re-stock.. its more to do with the fact that why should we wait 17 days. I don&#039;t think any of the vendors are running a charity<br /><br />&lt;/end rant&gt;

				Yes its been spotty for me all day. It&#039;s gotta be that botnet we&#039;ve been hearing so much about clogging up the Tor circuits. If you open up your Vidalia Control Panel and view the network, you can actually see Tor trying to make connections and failing. I hear updating your Tor helps, but not all that much. Just be persistant and keep trying. You&#039;ll get in eventually.

				It&#039;s the botnet. I think it&#039;s running during the day and then shut down later on at night.(US times) I can&#039;t log on at all until like 7-9pm Eastern. It has been like this for me the last couple of days. During the day it continues to time out, but later on in the evening I can log on just fine.
