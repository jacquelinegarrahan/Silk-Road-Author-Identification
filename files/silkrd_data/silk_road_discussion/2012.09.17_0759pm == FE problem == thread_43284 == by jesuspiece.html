				Title: <strong>FE problem</strong><br />

				So I ended up getting in contact with starservice, he finally got my package out of processing and into transit. The thing I&#039;m worried about is in her seller information he asked that if you had under 5 purchases on SR, he wanted you to FE. I don&#039;t know if that was mandatory or what not, but its making me nervous.<br /><br /><br />I ended up clicking the finalize button before the package ended up even getting here, because I thought if I didn&#039;t my package wouldn&#039;t get here, considering he asked me to FE. Is there a difference from the finalize button and the finalize early button? b/c the finalize early button wasn&#039;t even there all i saw was 17 days under finalize early I believe. <br /><br /><br />Does that mean I really didn&#039;t have to FE, and should&#039;ve waited for package to get to my house before finalizing ??

				There is no &quot;Finalize Early&quot; button because Vendors are not suppose to ask you to finalize early.&nbsp; Many still do it.&nbsp; Especially for those that have few or no purchases.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually quite common.&nbsp; Just make sure that if you finalize early that you don&#039;t give any feedback.&nbsp; When you finalize just hit the &quot;Silk Road&quot; symbol in the upper left and it will exit you without requiring feedback.&nbsp; Do the feedback when you receive the package.&nbsp; Once you get a few purchases (five or more)I would refuse to finalize early any more.&nbsp; There are Vendors who do not require it.&nbsp; This is for your safety.

I think we&#039;re all very tired of dozens of messages on a vendors page that say &quot;FE will comment later&quot; and then nothing ever happens D=<br /><br />We can&#039;t make well-informed decisions when we don&#039;t have any reviews from people that have actually used the product they supposedly bought!<br /><br />I wish he would bother to come on the forums...always bothers me when a vendor has no presence here :( Sent him/her a message 2 days back asking about my order, never got a response and it was never even read. I was going to request certain flavors of the &quot;hash candy&quot;...would have been nice if he&#039;d been bothered to ask about it. I&#039;d like to see better listing too: perhaps split the flavors into their own pages and be able to order a &quot;variety pack&quot; of 10, 20, and 50 would be cool (I see the 100 listing...bit too much for me)<br /><br />Edit: Ordered some head band from alllove the same time as I ordered the candies from starservice, got the weed today, I expect the candies will probably take another 2-3 days, since it was marked in transit last night

				It&#039;s really up to the vender if he wants to request it, and he needs to message you if he wants to, no matter what it says on his vendor page. Asking a buyer to FE should always be an unusual request, not something the vendor should assume you&#039;ll do. Next time, just wait or message him to ask if he is requiring FE for your order. If he cancels the order without any communication then he&#039;s a bad vendor and should be avoided. I have an order with starservice: it was marked in transit after 2 and a half days without any communication (although I&#039;ve tried). To be fair, I ordered Friday afternoon, I don&#039;t necessarily expect vendors to be shipping at that time, but it&#039;d be useful to know the days he DOES drop packages off. You should be fine though, he&#039;s rating was very good when I ordered from him, although (very strange) it&#039;s showing up as &quot;93&quot; now...it was &quot;100&quot; before. I&#039;ve never seen a rating drop that quickly, and I can&#039;t see any reviews that would explain in, might be a glitch.
