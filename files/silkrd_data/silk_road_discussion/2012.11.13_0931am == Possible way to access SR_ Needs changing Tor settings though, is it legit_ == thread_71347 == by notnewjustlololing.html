				With the site down, I was researching hidden services and trying to see if there&#039;s anything we could potentially be doing on the client side to help reduce the load.<br /><br />I came across a post elsewhere from some guy who says if you change some thing in your Tor config and in Torbutton then access to hidden services will be &quot;more efficient.&quot; He has a video tutorial of how he changed the settings here: http://rc4u5nj5fzfgynuj.onion/ I PM&#039;d him and he said that if enough people followed his instructions then he&#039;s &quot;pretty sure&quot; we&#039;d all be able to get back onto the SR site but I&#039;m skeptical.<br /><br />Dunno if this guy&#039;s tutorial is legit or would doing it compromise security? Could folks please check out the video and report your thoughts.

				I don&#039;t think any video tutorial in the world or whatever else could be contained in that link could ever get you access to a site that is physically taken off line. That being said I am not a tech head just more of an enthusiast.

				Well like I said, I was just researching hidden services so I am no expert either. To clarify, I don&#039;t think he meant it would solve the current outage, just that it would reduce the website load if enough people did it. I dunno though.

Where? Oh, you must mean that other link that is NOT the same link. Seriously, I have nothing do with that Roxyconnect guy so please don&#039;t make assumptions. I am just asking about this link http://rc4u5nj5fzfgynuj.onion/ which I have posted ONLY in this thread asking about it! I can see how it may seem suspicious asking people to check out a link but honestly it is just a video that I&#039;m wondering about the *content* of it.

				Never change settings in TOR unless you know exactly what you&#039;re doing. It&#039;s not worth compromising your security just to access a website.

				I guess great minds think alike D, because in short, that is why I clicked on this. Do not fiddle with the tor settings without learning what you are doing, and what effects it could have. Take for example the situation below.<br /><br />Find deep web link saying &quot;Backdoor to Silk Road!&quot; -&gt; Steps have you turn on Java inside your Tor browser, you load malware that tracks and relays your action on tor, now the steps to the &quot;backdoor of SR&quot; are not corrected to previous settings, thus there is now data, with your SR info, floating around and being sent off. If you are running Linux I figure you are in better shape, but judging by the question, especially be careful on Windows :)<br /><br />Just looking out for you mate, deep web can get into some /b/ shit, and safe is always a better choice when it comes to these things that we can control!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br />-F&amp;H
