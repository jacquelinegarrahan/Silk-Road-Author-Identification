				I went to check on some cash and some research chems I had buried in the woods about 3 years ago and discovered to my horror that water had got in the container and ruined some of the chems, including a very large amount of 2C-E :(<br /><br />I had the drugs and cash wrapped in 3 clip-seal bags with glad-wrap in between each layer. The drugs were individually put inside condoms as well. Then the clip-seal bags were put in a thick lunch box which was wrapped in a plastic bag with several thick rubber bands around it and buried. Obviously this was not enough and over the years water had found it&#039;s way inside.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about re-burying them but inside a vacuum flask this time with both layers of threading wrapped with silicone wrap (the kind you put around leaking pipes). The drugs and cash inside the vacuum flasks will be vacuum sealed as well.<br /><br />Do you think this will be enough to keep water out for several years while buried under the ground? I didn&#039;t know where else to come for advice.

				Vacuum seal it first<br /><br />Then throw it in a pvc pipe that is threaded on both ends. Put it in the pvc pipe, screw the caps on, wrap it in duct tape and then bury

				Mason jar for chems.&nbsp; Make sure the lid seal is airtight.&nbsp; Wrap it in whatever miscellaneous packaging material other people recommend after that.

				Hey mate.... Pelican Cases.... nuff said.<br /><br />They work brilliantly for me.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t forget where you buried them, GPS co-ordinates can help<br /><br />Also, vac seal stacks of cash, the amount it shrinks down to is amazing!
