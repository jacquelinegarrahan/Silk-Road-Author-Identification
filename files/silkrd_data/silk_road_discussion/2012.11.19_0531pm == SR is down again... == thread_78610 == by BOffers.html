				silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to works, but that&#039;s less secure I guess. Although if you go on it with that once, not sure if you have to log on, you will be able to access the page normally. That&#039;s how it works for me anyways.

				Its the same as its always been for me for the past year. Takes a while to connect, and once connected, connection drops in and out intermittently..<br /><br />Bleh, you work with what you got. I&#039;m just grateful this place exists. I&#039;m sure the recent article in The Daily Mail has not helped server load.

				Bmrv - what a total yawn. <br /><br />Yes everyone head to BMR if you fancy being scammed. In fact I&#039;m pretty certain if you ever attended a BMR meet up IRL it would consist of alley rapings while they beat of to Erasure&#039;s &quot;oh L&#039;amour&quot; and shit in your mouth. <br /><br />If that&#039;s your thing...<br /><br />Someone give -1 to that bell end

				It&#039;s been kind of iffy for me as well since the downtime.&nbsp; Sometimes it pops right up on the first try, other times I have to refresh four or five times.&nbsp; It&#039;s just the nature of the beast I think.
