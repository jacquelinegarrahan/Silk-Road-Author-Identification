That&#039;s progress for sure :)&nbsp; That shows DPR is working his ASS off to fix it. <br /><br />Also, I SAW ALL MY COINS INTACT. BTC was ALL there.

That has happened before in other crashes. you would see a very large amount of bids in the chart with nominal amounts but each one driving down the price more and more. In this case it seems to be heavily connected with the happenings on this forum and SR attack/DPR announcement. funny that.... maybe it&#039;s time to ride the wave???<br /><br />&nbsp;

				So happy to have access to the Road again. This site is an amazing privilege to have access to and I cannot extend my gratitude enough towards DPR and Staff.<br />I hope that the Road will continue to thrive, and these DOS attacks will not hinder the dedicated individuals that make this possible!<br /><br />I am so grateful to have the chance to spread the amazing and thought provoking entheogens that I can find only on Silk Road. <br />It is a blessing to know that the chemical purity of the products I will obtain are of high quality and safe to consume.<br /><br />Long Live Silk Road!

				Hmm i think as soon as the site is up, the site will crash from all the traffic.. can you imagine everyone who has btc in silk road logging in all at once to either withdraw coins or to make a purchase?? hopefully DPR prepares for this because there are alot of impatient ppl trying to log on all at once..
