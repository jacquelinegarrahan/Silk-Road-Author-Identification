				I agree with third place. I havnt gone and checked this for myself as I dont want to just do something which might be risky.<br /><br />Also I want to ask is this the same site, with all the same vendors and stuff or is it a new site? Can we use our old usernames and passwords to access?<br /><br />I dont have any money tied up in SR but obviously others have so is all that the same is the money still there?<br /><br />I pray this is the case.

				Yeah these are forums, but there&#039;s a market site on another thread. Be careful I&#039;m glad I&#039;m running TAILS on a live DVD.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go here:<br />http://sv3p2vkb6v54xh56.onion/<br />The site posted by Libertas is a forum; this is something else. <br /><br />The other URL is on a SR back up? post. It requires JS to be enabled, but NoScript doesn&#039;t detect any scripts. It recognizes user IDs (maybe from the backups posted?), but there&#039;s no option to change account settings, no option to change BTC addresses, and no purchasing stats. I&#039;m assuming this is a scam looking to get dumb ass people to deposit BTC in the scammer&#039;s account. Probably a Nigerian prince! I really doubt it&#039;s LE.<br /><br />I tried using a dummy ID, but that didn&#039;t work. I did log in with my account; if they want to bust me for buying a half ounce of weed, then I&#039;m cool with that LOL.<br /><br />I bookmarked the page after logging in; I then logged out and hit the new identity button in TB. When I clicked on the bookmark, I&#039;m logged in already. When I log out, the captcha doesn&#039;t change. <br /><br />It&#039;s asking for buyers to deposit 0.1 BTC and sellers 1 BTC. That&#039;s obviously way too cheap for a buyer account. Sooooo not real!

				So we rise again and brake the shackles with a forum? I hope people are right about the marketplace still to come. Is this the project StExo has been talking about? Is this Silk Road 2.0 that everybody has been warning against? When/if is the markeplace supposed to be up and will we be notified? Any chance this is an official back up plan in place? Is any info going to be restored or is it like starting from scratch? Will the marketplace be identical to SR? <br /><br />Sorry for all the questions but this is exciting stuff!

				First we were all going to BMR as that is the market thats been around the longest and imo is a lot mroe trustworthy than sheep.<br /><br />Then there were talks of a SilkRoad 2.0 project run by Godfather that turned out to most likely be a giant scam attempt.<br /><br />This is the project StExo was talking about, it does seem a bit more promising but at the moment its just a forum. If a site is being made from the ground up its going to take a hellofa long time.

The soldiers on that base would have been armed, and able to react, defend,and probably save lives, but another commie/lib (Clinton) had guns removed from military bases. <br /><br />Then a week ago a woman driving in DC, with a baby in the car no less, was executed by the Federales, and there was no outcry from the Corporate Gov&#039;t Controlled Media! - Before the day was over, the police/Federales were being praised as &quot;heroes&quot; no less! <br /><br />At no time did this fellow citizen of mine, pose a threat. If anything, she was lost in a recently constructed maze of barricades set up by the evermore proving their uselessness Dept of Homeland Security.&nbsp; Most likely panicked when the jack-booted thugs began to question her, no doubt like the Nazi MP&#039;s as seen in WWII films. &quot;Your papers please!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Side note. This was a black woman. Most of those cops were white. Where were the phonies like Al (Tawana Brawley) Sharpton?? Or Jesse (&quot;NYC is hymie-town&quot;) Jackson?

Having been successful in their implementation of the first step in their ingenious plot to cripple internet drug trafficking marketplaces at the root of their success by utilizing the widespread renown of the infamous marketplace that they themselves had only recently dismantled, the agents of the cyber-crime prevention unit gayly patted one another upon the back, proclaiming with a level of confidence only experienced by a predator as the gap that separates them from their prey grows smaller and smaller, that the monopolies of the narcotics vending world, whom recent history had proven to be as elusive in their apprehension as they were successful in their dubious trade, would parade wildly into the subterfuge with adolescent-like merriment as rumors of the Silk Road&#039;s rebirth began to flood the often-traversed nooks and crannies of the ever-expansive &quot;deepweb&quot;.<br /><br />In layman&#039;s terms, don&#039;t jeopardize your operation just because someone is using Silk Road&#039;s popularity in an attempt to try to draw the frequent users back in. It&#039;s probably LE attempting to acquire information on the vendors. If it&#039;s obvious to a bunch of stoners, junkies, tweakers and coke fiends that Silk Road&#039;s success was primarily attributed to the work that the vendors themselves put in, don&#039;t you think that it&#039;s also obvious to LE? And what better way to take down said vendors&#039; operation than by encouraging them to do so in an environment that LE themselves have established as a medium for collecting information in secret? In principle, it&#039;s exactly the same thing as the DEA running a trap house sting operation. Once they have enough evidence to put a major dent in the drug activity that goes on in their jurisdiction, it&#039;ll be too late to wipe your hard drive and hide your payload.<br /><br />And for the love of God, please don&#039;t use the excuse that Libertas is in favor of the new site, because for all you know, Libertas&#039; account was used as a pawn to keep the forums up and to keep enough ongoing interest in Silk Road around long enough to make the users think that they&#039;re making the right move as they&#039;re being manipulated directly into to a checkmate scenario.

The only person you should be trusting is yourself, and the only security you should be trusting is the security that you have control over - that means that you need to take full responsibility for your actions and ensure that you&#039;re acting at all times in a manner which maintains a high level of security, exceeding security &#039;best practice&#039; wherever possible.<br /><br />Libertas

The forums WILL go down eventually; they will either be taken down by our enemies, or taken down by the hosting company for non-payment. It&#039;s just a matter of waiting to see which comes first.<br /><br />Libertas
