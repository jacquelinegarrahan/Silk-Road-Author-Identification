				Here&#039;s some thoughts, they are just mine...

The problems are things like planting drugs (know a few people that its happened to), illegal search and seizures, brutal force with no reason, random stops giving bullshit tickets just to meet quota, extortion,ect more or less they break all the same laws we break and them some. And to make matters worse they&#039;re aloud to go free because of that little piece of metal on their chest. If it was me or you we would be spending a big portion of our lives locked up like animals.<br /><br />@scout I think that&#039;s why he said he quit because he felt guilty about the way that police officers are/encouraged him to be, and he didn&#039;t want to become that way. He probably felt bad about planting drugs and bursting through peoples door over personal choices to take drugs that aren&#039;t harming anyone.

				I think you are misdirecting your hatred to the wrong people. LEO are not the ones who create the laws, they are the ones that we pay to uphold it. Ultimately, we elect the people who create the laws we have, and while we may not all agree with all of them it is impossible to please everyone.<br /><br />There has to be some authority. There has to be someone to uphold the rules of the game we play everyday called life. Without LEO, there would be complete chaos and your life would be worse off without them. There would be no security. It would be insane.<br /><br />Just think for a minute what you are advocating. I don&#039;t know what your intention was by posting the addresses of those LEO&#039;s but I cannot imagine it was anything good. They choose a job which will allow them to make ends meet, something that we all struggle to do. I know that their job may infringe upon your beliefs but that is why you have the power to change the laws that you have quarry with. No offense but your armchair vigilantism makes you less of a man than the cops that you speak so low of.<br /><br />My experiences with LEO has always been fair. I treat them with the respect I expect them to give me. Many times in fact I have been allowed to go free when I should have been arrested. They are not there to fuck you over unless you have done something which society has collectively decided you should be fucked for.<br /><br />Police did not make the policies you have beef with. Take it up with your lawmakers and re-evaluate your agenda because quite frankly its immature and pointless.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s been over two years and Silk Road is still here.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had setbacks here and there, but I&#039;m happy to say that mostly we&#039;ve thrived.&nbsp; Everyone who&#039;s taken their security seriously, and many who haven&#039;t remain free and prosperous despite the wishes of the powerful law enforcement agencies that target us.&nbsp; It is easy to start feeling confident, invincible, even cocky.<br /><br />I encourage you to look for this in yourself and refrain from acting on it.&nbsp; A thread was recently started in this forum publishing the personal information of LE agents that users had a particular grudge with.&nbsp; Let me make this abundantly clear:<br /><br />We are not strong enough to attack our enemies directly! <br /><br />If we start organizing attacks from this forum against LE agents, it will become exponentially harder to resist their attacks and keep Silk Road alive.&nbsp; This task is hard enough as it is, please don&#039;t make it any harder!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The mere existence and survival of SR is an indirect attack on LE whether they like it or not. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re pretty pissed about that but don&#039;t have the authority to pull out the big guns. If direct attacks happened on LE I&#039;m sure they would have the green light to use whatever means necessary to bring SR down. Sometimes we forget that if given the permission the NSA could bring SR down to it&#039;s knees but to be honest I think the government has bigger problems to deal with such as China stealing top secret military plans(lol).<br /><br />&nbsp;I think that would be the ultimate goal if I was in a position of authority in SR would be to make it as unperishable as possible which I think has been done very effectively proven by the mere existence of SR today.<br /><br />Some people use SR to get their drugs and get high and in that they are thankful for but in the grand scheme of things SR is so much more. It&#039;s given the freedom and rights back to the people to do as they wish with their bodies. We are all adults here and we should have the freedom to choose what to put in our bodies as long as we don&#039;t harm others. No longer having to turn to buying drugs from the street I think a site like SR actually helps LE whether they like to admit or not. One example of their losing war on drugs is the crackdown on meth labs in Colorado. Last year there was an unusually large amount of meth labs there with noob cooks getting injured and what not. After a long police crackdown they&#039;re almost non-existant but yet the amount of meth on the streets has increased. Now instead of the meth being made in the city it&#039;s coming in from large Mexican drug cartels. LE will never win this war as shown by the past and I think DPR and his team are actually helping clean up the streets. Nobel peace prize anyone? =)<br /><br />

After all, if it were dangerous, heaps more people would have been caught.&nbsp; LE are powerless, right? You can taunt them and there&#039;s nothing they can do!<br /><br />But drug use is much less accepted by the mainstream majority than pirating the odd movie. And using the site is only &#039;safe&#039; when all of the anonymity precautions are rigorously adhered to.&nbsp; And whilst LE may direct resources elsewhere when a market is operating quietly and off the radar, they will throw a ton at it if you start sticking your finger up at them.<br /><br />I think we will be seeing a lot more arrests due to these two types of complacency from users.&nbsp; Or the security-conscious will simply migrate somewhere safer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyone who thinks our enemies are sitting idly by twiddling their thumbs totally befuddled about what to do re SR is living in a fantasy world. This place is a massive fuck you to the systems of coercion and control so poking the bear is definitely NOT a good idea.<br /><br />With regards to people finding this place and having absolutely ZERO consideration for their personal safety, well all I can say is that I have been absolutely flabbergasted by some of the things I have seen in my time here.<br /><br />The saying &quot;just because you can doesn&#039;t mean you should&quot; has never rung more true in the sense of downloading Tor and finding a URL. There have been some high profile cases of people busted in AU for SR related activity but in reality it was their IRL activities that brought them to the attention of LEO. <br /><br />I fear we will be seeing a lot more cases of people coming into contact with the CJS as so many people treat this place like eBay doing incredible things like creating market site accounts under their real name and/or user names they use for other internet accounts that pop up in a Google searches.<br /><br />... and that&#039;s just for starters... the list just gets scarier as demonstrated in StExo&#039;s thread so I&#039;ll leave it there for now.<br /><br /><br />

				DPR is right, best to just wish the cops well, in fighting the crimes like rape and murder, which I&#039;m sure most would sooner do that bust people here for selling what the police know will always be around and always make them look bad as they concentrate too much resources into drugs and litle proecting the people from real crimes.<br /><br />I also does not help when drug dealers form gangs and shoot each other. Silk Road, is at least not a road in which we are ducking bulles or being harrassed by rip off merchants.<br /><br />Silk Road also cuts down the odds of people being sold something nasty. Most buyers here wish the police no harm. We all mosly have families, we all want to get home after work and see them.<br /><br />The police also creae mistrust when hey pick on the young whose only &#039;crime&#039; is often smoking a joint.<br /><br />I think anyone thinking of attacking the police should think again. SR is no here to do that and its pointless. <br /><br />As the character Omar off the street said &quot;Its all in the game&quot;&nbsp; :) (That series, was an American cop and drug dealers show. Omar was the black guy who robbed other drug dealers!

				We all know Jack N Hoff is a drug addled thirty something, pain killer addicted, CP viewing self loathing piece of shit. <br /><br /><br />Let him take solace in his sanctuary you mean motherfuckers. This place allows his ego to flourish in a way his aging, crusted body could never dream of in his physical reality.<br /><br />Dare I say it?<br />I do, I do.<br /><br />Let him live.<br />Just let him live.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />ALTERNATE THEORY:<br /><br />But for real Jack, I think you&#039;re a fucking cop. <br /><br />And I want everyone to think about that for a real hard second.<br /><br />This motherfucker makes more posts than anyone, braggadocio claims of stashes/former comrades in prison, etc- etc - For what? Why are you trying to convince anyone that you&#039;re anything? You fit the stereotypical mold of a LEA trying to garner a groups trust. And then to pull some shit like posting LEO officers information... WTF? Just seriously. WTF.<br /><br />Sounds like when the FBI goes and rouses up some 20 something year old FOB moron to blow some shit up with (fake) bombs they sold him. <br /><br /><br />I would be very weary to be the first person to order from the official Jack N Hoff vendor account.<br />Which is surprisingly only doing bulk.<br /><br />How convenient. <br />
