				These are testing times we have been in the last few days. The site and forum have literally been under a full scale assault. And don&#039;t for a minute think it&#039;s a coincidence or just some bored kids trying to hit SR for fun. No fucking chance of that. Whatever is going on, is a coordinated, planned out attack on this community and all of us. Maybe it&#039;s the same forces that were trying to manipulate the price of BTC by hitting the exchanges, hitting SR to shake up confidence&amp; see the effect it would have on BTC value. Maybe it&#039;s competitors like BMR/Atlantis. Maybe it&#039;s extortionists who are demanding they be paid off and won&#039;t attack.<br />Maybe its LE. <br /><br />There is a lot of bitching going on about &quot;I can&#039;t place my order! What the fuck&quot; or &quot;This fucks up my business, I can&#039;t vend. I&#039;m going over to Atlantis&quot; &quot;Man the site is still down, SR has shitty security&quot;.<br /><br />Yeah everyone is affected. Buyers, vendors, forum members, staff, mods, DPR. But that&#039;s the price we pay for being apart of this place. Shit hits the fan sometimes, and that&#039;s life. Dread Pirate Roberts and his team have been fighting off whatever threats nonstop for days now. A lesser man would have said &quot;ok, fuck this. I didn&#039;t sign up for THIS SHIT&quot; and runoff with everyones BTC and there would be no recourse ever. But obviously he&#039;s not. <br /><br />What about the good times? What about the months/years (for some of you) of benefiting in some way from this site/community/idea? We&#039;re all here because for some reason Silk Road was a dream come true. And some scum want to take that dream away from us. I for one will NOT abandon.<br />I will stay here as long as it takes. I will not go over to Atlantis and BMR, becauase, well.. fuck them. I&#039;m not going to be manipulated by outside forces to give up on SR come hell or high water. I&#039;m going to stand with DPR, Silk Road, and this community no matter what. And believe me, when DPR is done, this place is going to be a fortress. That&#039;s how much faith I have in the guy.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t going to stick around during the bad times, then don&#039;t bother coming back for the good times.

				Very true. However any vendor with a good attitude toward business has also evaluated the new risks and is contemplating business continuity strategies in case SR goes down for a business impacting length of time. It is not to say they have given up on SR, but they are realistically looking at all outcomes. <br />ACE<br />

				I&#039;ll stay as long as I can.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here awhile, and don&#039;t see myself giving my trust away to Atlanstits just yet.<br />We&#039;ve seen the road go down for days, and even seen a forum reset.&nbsp; I&#039;m not too worried about the road, I think we&#039;ve just got another hurdle to jump.

				I agree with the OP, I&#039;m not going anywhere.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor but I would understand if they want to diversify their market by selling on multiple sites... but that&#039;s not me.&nbsp; I have been here for almost two years and my loyalty stays.&nbsp; Prices (outside of LSD) were always fair for the drugs I buy, I like the forums, I like the layout, model, and security of Silk Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you DPR for providing this service, wish you the best in thwarting the efforts of those who want to ruin this great place.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be waiting for SR to return, even if it takes a while!

				+1 colorblack <br /><br />I consider SR to be my go to place, I have poked around BMR and even Atlantis for a second (to see what it was all about)&nbsp; and I felt like I was cheating on my mistress with a much dirtier diseased mistress! With that being said I am with SR till the end of days! Though I know very little about DPR I gather he/she is a revolutionary a hard worker a believer and a pioneer! I have nothing but love for DPR and the opportunities SR and this community has brought me. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t just stem to drug purchases, but friendships, education, and exxperiences I have gain from being part of this community. That is something that cant be taken away from me or anyone!<br /><br />In these crazy and uncertain times no one knows what the future may bring. I dont know the full history and past of SR and what the community has endured to come this far since I have only been around for a 2 years,&nbsp; but I know there will always be a future and a strong hold of legit buyer and sellers willing to work together to keep this community alive. <br /><br />My name is EnergyImport and I am honored to be part of this community, I am here for the long haul!<br /><br />Keep your head up, stay strong and have faith, and most importantly DPR and all the other SR staff/Mods Thank you your hard work does not go unappreciated!<br /><br /><br />

				The attacks just prove how important this place is.<br /><br />It&#039;s not just about the drugs, it&#039;s the ethos of the place, DPR&#039;s vision.

				as a vendor, when you log back in after a site outage, as there have been many over the time I&#039;ve been a part of this site.<br /><br />The orders still all come in as soon as the buyers can get on.<br /><br />Most buyers have item/products in their sight for days and know that purchasing bitcoins can take longer than 1 day sometimes.<br /><br />So if the site if down their orders that would have been placed are still placed.<br /><br />For example, I had 16 orders the hour after the last outage, hope to beat that once the site gets back up :)

I find myself wondering how many times somebody has gotten into the server and database that we don&#039;t know about. I suspect it&#039;s quite a few. I just cant seem to believe that we&#039;re at the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of anonymity technology and security when we can&#039;t go a month without a hack, scam, or DDoS attack...&nbsp; I won&#039;t criticize too harshly however, because like I said I know very little about such things, and ultimately what do I know?

Why? Because in your mind, DPR and SR are &quot;for the people?&quot; Get your head out of your ass.<br /><br />You seem to be overlooking one very critical piece of information; DPR is making millions off our business here. Do you believe for a single minute that DPR has done the things he&#039;s done for SR, because he&#039;s a good guy with upstanding moral values? Fuck no. He&#039;s kept this place running and has put on the &quot;rogue leader&quot; front for you guys, simply so he can further his own best interest; raking in ever more commission off these sales...&nbsp; Is it possible he&#039;s an upstanding guy, with a strong moral compass? Totally. In fact, it&#039;s actually quite likely (I personally get good vibes; but that doesn&#039;t count for shit when its just text you&#039;re reading online). However, is he doing what he&#039;s doing because he&#039;s looking out for the good/safety of the customers, or is he acting out of any sense of &quot;loyalty&quot; to the countless thousands (millions?) of paying customers who have helped him get to this point? Absolutely fucking not. Any action he takes on here, period, is to further his bottom line. I&#039;m not hating or saying that&#039;s a bad thing; I&#039;m just saying lets not get all foolish and naive in thinking DPR&#039;s actions are the result of any &quot;loyalty first&quot; attitude towards his customers and this community. When you&#039;re making tens of millions of dollars per year; it&#039;s sort of in your best interest to stick around as admin and make sure the site is operating smoothly and safely so you can continue drawing in those huge profits.<br /><br />I maintain the only reason DPR has stuck around here through thick and thin is because of the profits, and its naive to fool yourself into thinking otherwise... Again, I know this sounds like I&#039;m hating on DPR and SR, but I am absolutely not. If I were in his shoes; the only thing that would keep me sticking around as admin in today&#039;s dangerous public/legal spotlight would be that 25 mil/year salary... This is not to say DPR has no interest in maintaining the functionality and safety/efficacy of the site for users; of course he does. In fact, that&#039;s priority number one for him. <br /><br />I believe DPR created this from a place of utmost sincerity, passion and integrity. Unfortunately I also feel that DPR has let this place slip drastically. It&#039;s on it&#039;s way out... LE is working the case and has been for about a year and a half or better now. What&#039;s taking so long, you ask? Well, its a matter of huge coordination between LE agencies to pull off a bust of the scale of SR. This takes lots of time, lots of evidence building, lots of cooperation between local/state/federal LE agencies, etc. Not to mention, the feds have never seen anything like this. They&#039;ve busted countless drug dealers, criminal networks, cartels, etc over the past decades, but nothing in their prior experience has prepared them for taking out an organization like SR. Typical LE methods don&#039;t work here; they can&#039;t bust one of us and coerce us into snitching the rest out (we couldn&#039;t talk even if we wanted to; as we know nothing), they can&#039;t tap our phones and discern drop locations and associated criminal contacts, and they can&#039;t set up a sting purchase by giving an undercover a wad of cash to go in and make a purchase.&nbsp; That is what is taking them so long. I feel like a lot of people here have entirely forgotten the most crucial part of LE in the USA (and most other first world countries); they have resources that the majority of us do not. They are currently hard at work (and have been for almost a couple years now) gathering and compiling data and evidence, slowly unraveling this whole thing, connecting the dots one by one, and watching and waiting intently for DPR to slip up.<br /><br />The day is coming; and its coming very soon. I hope and pray I remain an overlooked needle in the haystack of the potential millions who are on SR or have used it in the past. However, I find it hard to believe that they won&#039;t sweep up a large group of buyers alongside the obvious vendors and site admin... I have a feeling LE is going to make a HUGE deal out of this bust. This is going to be front page news everywhere. The DEA and associated LE agencies are going to play this up as the biggest &quot;cyer-drug bust&quot; in history and I&#039;m sure they will claim they&#039;ve stopped one of the biggest drug rings in the country, just to prove your tax dollars are being put to good use. The goal of any LE agency is to perpetuate itself; and I&#039;m sure they will use the SR bust as a platform to drum up funding and create new &quot;cyber drug units,&quot; whose expertise will be put to use solely toward digital free-markets such as SR.<br /><br />Now back to DPR. <br /><br />I personally do not feel like he&#039;s doing enough. Then again, I am relatively computer naive when it comes to anonymous networks like Tor and cryptography and the various crypto-currencies.&nbsp; But first off, I feel like not enough has been invested into site security. We&#039;ve been hacked how many times? The phishing scams, the SR Direct Deposit scam, the DDoS bombs we&#039;ve been hit with over and over, etc...&nbsp; And those are just a few that we know about. I find myself wondering how many times somebody has gotten into the server and database that we don&#039;t know about. I suspect it&#039;s quite a few. I just cant seem to believe that we&#039;re at the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of anonymity technology and security when we can&#039;t go a month without a hack, scam, or DDoS attack...&nbsp; I won&#039;t criticize too harshly however, because like I said I know very little about such things, and ultimately what do I know? Perhaps DPR is investing heavily into security/anonymity for all. But something just doesn&#039;t seem right...<br /><br />Getting back to the OP&#039;s comment;<br /><br />The bottom line is that I&#039;m going to go wherever I feel is safest, and act according to my best interest as a customer. Has DPR done a lot for this community? Has he provided a solid moral ground for us to operate under? Has he revolutionized the way we do business and forever changed the face of the game? Of course. But let us not forget; he&#039;s done these things because that is what we are paying him to do. This is not some loyalty service he is providing for us, free of charge and out of the goodness of his heart. He&#039;s making HUGE sums of money to maintain an online interface in which he makes a commission off every sale arranged here; therefore his motivations are primarily financial in interest... let&#039;s be honest if there was no commission being made, DPR woulda fled the scene a long time ago. <br /><br />So by what logic do we &quot;owe him&quot; our loyalty here?<br /><br />He provided a service for us, because we paid him to do it. Was fun while it lasted, and I&#039;d love to stick around but don&#039;t think for a minute that my loyalty as a consumer is somehow owed to SR. If SR doesn&#039;t get it&#039;s shit together with these DDoS attacks, if they don&#039;t attempt to cap the newbies, and if they don&#039;t invest and implement better security/anonymity features; I&#039;ll be the first to admit that I&#039;m high-tailing it out of here and moving on over to one of the competitor sites. Love you DPR, you&#039;re a beautiful person who has done great things... I will be loyal to an extent, but my &quot;loyalty&quot; is contingent upon you making intelligent decisions, improving the functionality/accessibility/anonymity of the site, and flying beneath LE radar as much as possible. Once those things go out the window; so do I.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />1) How is your freedom, security or freedom compromised? Let me break it down for you - your freedom/safety/security was compromised the SECOND you set foot in the world of Silk Road.Before any of this shit went down, when you were happily buying drugs delivered straight to your door and enjoying your little half grams of coke and whatever.. you made your choice. Don&#039;t delude yourself. Everyone takes a risk using this site for it&#039;s purpose. You aren&#039;t special. <br />You&#039;re not &quot;expected&quot; to do anything. You&#039;re an adult, and most adults should be grateful to someone/something that they&#039;ve benefited from. But that&#039;s your call. <br /><br />2) That&#039;s awesome he&#039;s making tens of millions of dollars a year. No, it&#039;s FUCKING awesome. He&#039;s doing what you probably wish you could. I know I wish I could. And he&#039;s doing it. Good for him. Do you whine that Steve Jobs was making billions of your ipad and macbook pro? He was worshipped as an innovator, as a genius, as a modern day Albert Einstein and nobody had a problem with him making money. Did Jobs or DPR for that matter ever hold a gun to your head and say &quot;PAY ME OR DIE?&quot; No! You used your money to buy a product and you got that product. And in fact the product DPR has is fucking genius. Nobody else did it right the way he did. Why shouldn&#039;t he be a millionaire? Should he do it for free? Are you jealous? Do you think maintaining a site/forum like this, being on every fucking law enforcement agencies most wanted list, having people constantly DDOSing your servers, having to deal with scammers and all kinds of shit, interface with the press, and keep this site running so YOUR ungrateful ass can get high doesn&#039;t warrant compensation? I&#039;m assuming you earn a living somehow. Do YOU work for free?? I bet you enjoy your income, and if you could you&#039;d do everything possible to increase it. So fuck off with this &quot;DPR is a millionaire therefore he&#039;s a greedy self serving evil capitalist manipulating us&quot;. I&#039;ve interacted with the guy through private message several times for something, and let me tell you something.. the guy is a class act. I will never get into details, but I have seen first hand what he is behind the scenes. <br /><br />3) The fact that LE would love to shut this place down is not a secret. There&#039;s nothing new about what you&#039;re saying. It almost sounds like you&#039;re hopeful they take this place down. In fact, you say say that you hope you&#039;re a &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; if that happens. Hahahahah. What a pathetic little bitch you are. So, you want to be able to buy drugs and have all the fun in the world.. yet you want others to &quot;pay for the crime&quot; if that day comes? You remind of the mean spirited obnoxious kid in high school that would run and hide at the first sign of trouble.. and not hesitate to rat someone out to save his own ass. You must not be very well liked IRL. I don&#039;t know you and I don&#039;t like you on HERE. Your sentiments are absolutely overflowing with disgusting selfishnesses. Everything is about YOU. Well you know what? Fuck your selfish musings. In fact, I hope any vendor reading this post sees your post and refuses to vend to you. IN FACT again, any vendor who vends to him.. everytime this guy places an order, refuse him, and PM me, I&#039;ll cover the cost of his order just to spite this selfish fuck.<br />I mean it. <br /><br />4)If you feel like he&#039;s not doing enough then LEAVE. Why are you still here? If you&#039;ve read this far that means you&#039;re still here, which bothers me. Just leave. <br /><br />5) So you&#039;re in effect, blackmailing DPR to cater to your needs otherwise you will take&nbsp; your business elsewhere? HAHAHA. Dude, I have no way of knowing how much business you give to this place, but it&#039;s a &quot;needle in the haystack&quot; (to use your own words) compared what other people SINGLE HANDEDLY happily spend in 1 week. You think you threatening to go to a competing site means anything to anyone? Fuck no it doesn&#039;t. You will not be missed, one bit. <br /><br />This place is awesome, and will continue to be awesome. LE can&#039;t touch it, otherwise they would have. Do some research, there was a CP investigation in which the FBI admitted that they TOR has rendered their efforts useless. LE will never be able to &quot;touch&quot; DPR or the Silk Road infrastructure. They WILL be able to get idiots. And this poster seems like very prime idiot real estate. But I wouldnt wish that on him either. <br /><br />I&#039;m a criminal just like everyone else here, but I don&#039;t bite the hand that feeds me. This place will succeed, and has overcome EVERY SINGLE ONE OF ITS CHALLENGES through the years. In fact it&#039;s time like these that purge the weak from the strong. Fumanchu.. run along now. Atlantis is taking new members. So is BMR. Better yet, try Topix.<br /><br />VIVA SILK ROAD.<br /><br />

				And another thing I forgot to add.<br /><br />In all seriousness.. I know this is a free-market and the very principles of SR are about people having the choice to do what they want. But let&#039;s assume if it were competitors or competitor friendlies behind all this. Aside from my earlier suggestion that we just go to war and hire some technically proficient evil mercenary(ies) to wreack havoc.. the other option is to NOT spend your BTC at competing places. Hit them financially as well. If they think rendering SR useless will bring in more customers.. you render their masterplan useless by not spending BTC on those sites and waiting it out for SR to be rocksolid again. <br />Think about that people..

				Haters are everywhere so just don&#039;t care about them. It&#039;s great community and I&#039;m really glad that I can be part of this. I guess that DPR can&#039;t do nothing about attack because it&#039;s DDoS and what is worst there&#039;s no protection from it. There&#039;s some protection solutions but it&#039;s only available for clearnet websites and main protection is to have stronger servers than attacker but it&#039;s not solution for website like this. What&#039;s more preparing DDoS cost less than protecting from DDoS. Let just fuck all fuckin SR interrupters.<br />

				(in reference to the post about Atlantis being faster then SR)<br /><br />Because there&#039;s a total of 8 people on that site. 4 feds, 2 customers, 1 disgraced&amp;banned vendor from here, and 1 vendor selling everything from weed to crack.<br />who only accepts Litecoins.<br /><br />SR is The Godfather. And Atlantis reminds me of a direct-to-dvd movie starring an overweight Steven Seagal teamed up with Whoopi Goldberg in a buddycop/coming of age dramedy.

I will purchase anywhere I choose, just like in &#039;real life&#039;. Usually there is a supermarket that I prefer to use, but if there is a great special price at another, it is highly likely that I would go and shop there.<br /><br />What is this talk of loyalty? I have made no claims on DPR&#039;s time or money, nor has he made any such claims on me. Loyalty is something of a personal nature, not something given to a shopping website.

				My two cents..<br /><br />At this point it&#039;s all speculation.<br />We simply do not know who is behind the sustained attacks. <br /><br />It could be LE, it could be the competition, it could even be a disgruntled former customer and/or vendor.<br />There&#039;s strong cases for all those candidates but when all is said and done, all we can do is sit tight and wait for the outcome. <br /><br />Personally, I will show my support for SR by NOT taking my custom elsewhere. I&#039;m not even entertaining the idea for a second.<br /><br />In my opinion, it&#039;s far more likely that the competition are behind this. So, the best thing I can do to is to keep my coins until SR is up and running once more - something I am certain will happen eventually.<br /><br />Addicts may not have the luxury of being able to remain brand loyal, as it were. I understand&nbsp; that.<br />But recreational users and/or small time re-sellers, please show your support by not taking coins elsewhere. <br /><br />That&#039;s how I see it anyway. <br />

Maybe it&#039;s the same forces that were trying to manipulate the price of BTC by hitting the exchanges, hitting SR to shake up confidence&amp; see the effect it would have on BTC value.

And some scum want to take that dream away from us. I for one will NOT abandon.<br />I will stay here as long as it takes. I will not go over to Atlantis and BMR, becauase, well.. fuck them. I&#039;m not going to be manipulated by outside forces to give up on SR come hell or high water. I&#039;m going to stand with DPR, Silk Road, and this community no matter what.

				It&#039;s been days of up/down, even the forums have been hit on occasion, but morale is high and people have faith in SR/DPR and are sticking it out. <br />Fuck yes. This is why &quot;we&quot; will win and the piece of shit attacker will lose (already losing as the site is seeing more uptime then downtime).

				Well you dont buy everything from the same store, its the same with drugs. I prefer SR, its the only centralized system I&#039;ve been able to adhere to. I appreciate the heart that goes into SR. DPR has a purpose other than profit. This isnt true of any other centralized market. With that said, SR would have to go down for quite some time for me to make a temporary string of purchases from any other market. I don&#039;t see why anyone would leave, and not come right back as soon as SR was back up.

				The early bird gets the worm. Silk Road was the first site of its kind to GET IT RIGHT. There were several places online you could get drugs (IRC Channels, and even BBS&#039;s before that).. but there were all kinds of problems. Safety issues, payment protection (escrow), quality control, no feedback etc. <br />But DPR got it right with Silk Road and hit a fucking home run. Apple wasn&#039;t the first company to come out with a portable music player.. (Sony Walkman anyone? Or even those little mp3 portable pieces of shits), but Jobs managed to nail every issue and BOOM.

				I will stand by SilkRoad until the day the captain abandons the ship. SR has provided me with so much love and insight that I can&#039;t even put it into words. I&#039;ve been scammed once, but that was to a large extent my own fault. I have been called into interrogation at the customs for seized MDMA once. Got out from that without any trouble, much thanks to the help I got from this community in how to handle an interrogation. Denial, denial, denial. Other than that I&#039;ve had 10+ perfect transactions and spent $4400. I&#039;ve got bulk orders of MDMA, LSD and 2c-b so cheap that I could sell of 1/3 of it and still make a small profit. Nowhere else would I have ever been able to do that. SR has simply added so much value to my life and for that I am forever thankful and loyal. <br /><br />Finally, I&#039;ve filled out my &quot;backup Bitcoin address&quot; in my account settings. If SR would go down for a long period or for good, I have full trust in DPR sending me my BTC. He is a business man and he knows the value of trust.

				Anyone actually browsed BMR and Atlantis?<br /><br />There is virtually no feedback. Most vendors require FE and there is an absolute dearth of UK vendors.<br /><br />For my drug of choice, #3 Heroin, I have the option of Finalizing Early or waiting for a delivery from the USA or Canada to perhaps make it past customs. I don&#039;t think so. <br /><br />In my mind there is no competition.<br /><br />I am lucky as I have a methadone Rx but if I was an American hanging out for some gear I would certainly hit up the other markets but at the end of the day SR is still a cut above, despite having less features than, say, BMR. <br /><br />The SR downtime is a killer with a monkey on your back but at the end of the day that is the customers problem not that of SR or the vendor.

No. <br /><br />The fact that DPR and SR are fighting tooth and nail is loyalty.

				Genuine revolutionary acts - acts which transform the status quo, acts which replace pyramid hierarchies with horizontal structures - acts which openly and successfully challenge the hegemonic powers - acts which reveal the hypocrisy in bourgeois (think &#039;moral majority&#039;) morality - are very rare indeed.<br /><br />Some people here are naturally content with just buying drugs in a safe and peer reviewed environment. For other it is drugs &#039;plus&#039; - and the plus encompasses all the points above. This experiment in - what? - &#039;cyber mutualism&#039; - has been a success. I have learned to qualify my distrust of others and have seen how mutual interest can work to produce a valid and profitable service - further - in the drug trade of all things.<br /><br />The drug trade is notorious for violence and deceit. Yet here the drugs - though sometimes priced at a premium - are reviewed by other users and their quality is usually as expected. No danger to the vendor or the buyer is encountered in the usual sense. It actually minimises harm - many studies indicate that users who remain separate from the &#039;scene&#039; are far less likely to develop problem usage patterns - and also SR reduces the transaction to one between supplier and demander. In doing so it lays bare much of the redundant drug war rhetoric in support of selective prohibition, as no one but the vendor and buyer are involved. That is, no room for shrill &#039;schoolyard&#039; propaganda, no visible &#039;drug problem&#039;, reduced harm potential due to testing and review of drugs, a reliable source replete with alternatives should one depend on supply, a means of maintaining drug use without impact on one&#039;s private life.<br /><br />I am firmly with DPR for these reasons, as well as the fact that I enjoy being able to buy my drugs without that having any effect on my wider lifestyle. In that narrow sense the efforts of DPR have empowered me, as much more of my time is free and I have no public contact with drug vendors. I am fully aware of the alarming nature of the example he has set in the eyes of state agencies everywhere, and I applaud his vision and fortitude in managing to maintain this gadfly site of his. <br /><br />TL:DR DPR is a ledge. #YOLO Where do I buy DPR T-shirt? :----D :D :D :D
