				Ok so I have a few outdoor plants&nbsp; 8) doing pretty well right now and I was hoping to push a pound or 2 of some decent quality bud with a pretty good price ($3500 per 2 lbs)... But I don&#039;t want to throw $500 at a vendor account just to make one sale... Is there any way I can make just one sale and avoid the vendor fees?

				Sounds like a scam if user wants to do transaction outside of escrow and wanting to buy a vendor account.&nbsp; A lot could go wrong with that &quot;1 transaction&quot; .&nbsp; To the buyers, you&#039;ve never shipped a package.&nbsp; So your not well educated about shipping practices and would be a hazard to yourself and the buyer.&nbsp; Let alone the price sounds like a scam as well.&nbsp; Be warned.&nbsp; Stick to legit vendors with escrow.

				If you&#039;re selling that much at once, don&#039;t worry about the $500 fee... I think it&#039;s once a vendor completes at least $1000 in transactions, they get the $500 back..... so you&#039;ll get it back anyways.

				You would get more money by taking the time to break down your 2 pounds into smaller listings and... being a normal vendor. Its not like The Silk Road keeps your vendor bond. Its a bond. You get it back after what, 1000, 1200 worth of sales?

				Didnt know you could get back the $500... good to know and for the puss puss that said I was trying to scam.... eat a dick. I would never make somebody go out of escrow and I know all the precautions to take while shipping something as smelly as weed. I would just rather get alot off my hands at once the easiest way I know how<br /><br />

				There are a few vendors on here who act as middle men, GumtreeUK or something is the UK one. Go to their vendor page and you&#039;ll find their global ones.<br /><br /><br />Must warn you though, I wouldn&#039;t use them. It would be way to easy for them to scam you.

By then I should have 30+ transactions at my current (self-chosen) slow place on this particular account.

As a former and future grower, the fact that you&#039;re already planning on making sales and know what kind of weight you&#039;ll get from your two plants due in October + the usual drying/curing suggests that you have no idea how outdoor weed works. <br /><br />3500 for two pounds of novice bud &lt; buying bud from established vendors... <br /><br />I would go check on your plants and make sure they make it through the summer before you offer to sell your wares. <br /><br />Trolololololo.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sigh... I only said 2 pounds KNOWING I will get more, but obviously I&#039;ll push alot of it for cheap in real life, I just wanted a good way to get rid of bulk and get cash in hand and anything over 2 pounds is really sketchy to send, shit i&#039;d probably send the 2lbs in 2 1lb packages... I have 6 massive plants in 2 different grow spots (2 in a greenhouse, 4 in a WIDE open field deep where no one will find it) and i&#039;ve been growing for 4+ years. Last year me and a friend had well over 4 pounds together off of 6 plants&nbsp; and&nbsp; I gave (for free) a pound away to a former middle school teacher I had that basically taught me the do&#039;s and don&#039;ts of growing. The quality wasn&#039;t great but then again they were just random seeds my friend had for a while.<br /><br />This year we bought them from an online seedbank and we have 2 blue dreams, a NYC sour d, a trainwreck, a gdp, and an unknown that my boy found in some of the &quot;dankest bud he&#039;s ever smoked&quot; but i&#039;ve personally never seen dank bud with seeds so idk.<br /><br />But yeah if worse comes to worst I&#039;ll hit you up kenny&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Consider yourself privileged&nbsp; Ken, he&#039;ll hit you up with some outdoor buds, that will be so stressed they will turn hermaphrodite, and produce seed, then him&nbsp; and his&nbsp; spar, can smoke some dank outdoor stressed THC free bud. good luck with that one ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is why no one likes you<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How would you know that? by my Karma, of course that&#039;s what you judge everything on. Listen you&#039;re&nbsp; a brown nose., At least I speak my mind, and don&#039;t appease and placate ( and plate bum) just to fit in. revolting.

				The vendor bond is refunded after you complete 1500 USD in sales, but it is not hedged so it is the exact amount of BTC you paid originally, so if you pay now and a BTC is worth less than $106 when you get your refund, you will have profited
