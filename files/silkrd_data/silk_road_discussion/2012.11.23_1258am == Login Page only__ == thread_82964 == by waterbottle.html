				yeah same problem here, tried closing tor and rerunning with no success. the login page pops up much faster than usual but nothing after that. im sure its just a small problem and will be fixed soon. trying over and over might have something to do with the server not responding though, so i would probably just wait a little bit before trying again.

				Yeah down for me too, I must have typed my password 10 times then thought &quot;Oh shit phishing site&quot;. <br /><br />For a site that deals with real products, currency and money its starting to look more and more sketchy and unstable :/ <br />I had transferred a serious wad of btc before this incident, organized product and IRL trades. Now im shafted big time... <br /><br />Hopefully im just having a winge and the site springs back in a few hours... but if it goes down for days and days again then as the saying goes... if god gives you lemons... its time to find a new god lol

				I think the register page&#039;s captcha got messed up after this started and now only show 2 or 3 chars, so one easier way to see when its up instead of re-entering login may be to follow the register page and see when captcha there returns to normal http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/register

				I dont understand vendors are complaining - you know the nature of this site - it has advantages and disadvantages - if you feel the disadvantages are greater go back to the street- there are plenty of other vendors that will fill your shoes - maybe DPR sucks at running this site - or maybe its actrually a very difficult task and nobody else would do it better - fact is you have no idea. make your choices and live with them.

Just tried that and saw the same thing as you. During the last down time the captcha at the login page sometimes would show the three numbers.

Luckily I don&#039;t have any business to conduct atm, but I commiserate with everyone who has a pressing need to get on the main site.

				GRRR<br /><br />I was all about &#039;calm down everyone, it&#039;ll be fixed when they can&#039; last week.&nbsp; <br /><br />But this week I am just GRRRRR lol.&nbsp; Moreso cuz it&#039;s a 6 page long thread of nothingness, some sort of info, any info from anyone involved in the site&#039;s upkeep would be very much appreciated :(<br /><br />Oh and someone has a huge hardon against me right now, like 10 -ve karma&#039;s in the last 3 day&#039;s.&nbsp; Who are you and what did I do to you lol?&nbsp; Karma isn&#039;t really all that important I know, but if you look at the karma of someone like MTL (without reading his shit talk first) it&#039;s hard to take that person&#039;s post&#039;s seriously, and I am only posting to try and help people out.&nbsp; So it&#039;s a bit of a bummer to see that people will look at my stupid karma and think my posts are worthless when i&#039;m actually genuinely trying to help support this community which is already fraught with so much hate, lies and stupidity.<br /><br />GRRR, i&#039;m just having an impatient and upsetting day ... sorry for dumping that on this thread :P

				I&#039;m VERY glad to find this post. I was worried as others were that my account had been deleted or something! I kept trying and trying, and even tried to create a new account thinking mine had been deleted but that did that same thing as the log in page... Everything was working so great a little bit ago, the page was loading significantly faster too. Which I thought was odd. I kept checking my settings thinking maybe my settings changed to caching everything and that&#039;s why it was faster which would be no good for security but that wasn&#039;t it. Then Boom try to log in and it just keeps repeating the log in page! Damned it! I was just going to deposit coin and make a purchase tomorrow, and this vendor doesn&#039;t supply a contact email outside of SR. Well this is beat. At least I&#039;ll keep from depositing into bitcoins to keep my money spendable in case it is something serious, then I&#039;d have a bunch of bitcoins in a wallet and not able to have the cash with nothing to do with them! I&#039;m going to wait to deposit my cash until SR is back up running few at least a few days and people have reported no shady activity. So I know it&#039;s not LE that&#039;s fucking with the site and just computer errors in which I&#039;m hoping to see a &quot;down for maintenance&quot; screen, that would at least reassure me that its a technical error and DPR is adjusting the issue.<br /><br />So if we see a down for maintenance screen, I think we could all rest a little easier, knowing that it&#039;s a glitch or error and being addressed.

				better place to spend time than here while we wait may be in IRC, instant chat (over TOR). Seems to be many big vendors popping in now and then too that you can ask qs so its kinda like a live-chat support for some vendors.&nbsp; Anyway much better with organized (and/or private) instant chat and discussion there.. too bad the topic with instructions on how to find/use isn&#039;t advertised well and not too many seem to know of and use it..<br /><br />here&#039;s the forumlink with more info, it&#039;s already stickied in the Off-Topic section off this forum: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175.0<br />Theres mod(s) in there, buncha vendors and other users from this forum.. 40+ from SR community in total there now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Download mIRC (or whatever client) , Try figure out and join IRC-chat meanwhile instead. Any update will prolly be posted by someone there first anyway.<br /><br />For those who don&#039;t know IRC anyway it should be learned as you can find like hundred(s)++ of ppl on every weird narrow topic 24/7 there on all the different servers &amp; chans.. example #medicine on Freenode is usually some docs &amp; med students to ask all kinda med related qs, similar like #chemistry, #biology etc. science-related ones may be useful too and somewhat related. Other example, got a Q about Windows or a distro on linux, or perhaps just a program for linux or windows? Buying new hardware? go ask a bunch of hardware experts willing to discuss 24/7..&nbsp; Likely theres huge channels for pretty much everything of some interest, with loads of experts and other likeminded ready to discuss/answer. Wonder about TOR? on freenode #tor (i think it was?) you may find and speak to Tor devs, also buncha bitcoin chans.. And endless other topics of all kinds different places (including all kindsa crime, filesharing, pornsite logins,programming help, druggies tripping/shooting up together etc (some similar camchats etc) etc. etc...). The tricky part of figuring it out is good and like a noob-filter, keeps the bad chat and grandmas from Facebook out=P Those who don&#039;t know IRC is missing out;)&nbsp; <br /><br />so many reasons to get into IRC anyway. Not that much work to get into the basics, so suggest ppl who havent atleast take this time off to join Silkroad&#039;s IRC-chat and populate the chan there instead of spamming refresh here<br /><br />here check this topic- http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175.0

I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the only one , as I was in the middle of my two first transactions. Please, Please come back to us SR!

				I think the issue is caused by the character part of the captcha being only 4 characters long, when it&#039;s usually 5. There was a similar issue last week when only the numbers were showing. Only difference is that for some reason the error message isn&#039;t displaying.

				Honestly what some of you people don&#039;t realize is that SR constantly has to fight the attempted hacking of their <br />infrastructure they are always changing and evolving so that the governments/groups against them don&#039;t succeed <br />in taking them down. You&#039;re so worried that it&#039;s shut down so you complain but it does take time to change their<br />coding and security measures. <br /><br />Be patient and&nbsp; eventually the road will be safe to travel again.&nbsp; ;)

It helps me feed my kids, and yes obviously it isnt much but he provides a service unlike anyone I know. So if there&#039;s some hiccups, the way I see it, you deal with it or you get out.

				One thing that came to mind that if &quot;they&quot; could be monitoring &quot;who&quot; are using SR depending on those catchas sending somekind of data, if they know what catchas there is everytime its loaded and BlablablASOLO24 shows somekind of 0101010010001&#039;s everytime it&#039;s send and it could be monitored somehow?<br /><br />If some hacker dudes somewhere would me monitoring @ fbi the all data that is send in some nodes around the world somehow, they would see lots of &#039;samekind&#039; of stuff right now cause the catchas are pretty much the same?<br /><br />But safe bet that fbi dudes are sipping some coffee and editing the next war mongering videos/whatever and the catcha thing is just broken&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />PS. If pirate robert gets 5k+ a day from this site that should be more than enough to run the site, even though its very popular and on .onion. Don&#039;t get me wrong i&#039;m not bashing the best dude in the world.. just saying it&#039;s possible that roberts got a little greedy and has been neglecting the sites maintenance a bit lately?

				I love how everyone here doesn&#039;t use simple logic. Lets say the mainframe server is down, but the log in portion of the server is still partially up, that means the capcha will only show you the current letters and numbers that are loaded into the server. If the server isn&#039;t working it can&#039;t formulate more fucking caphas, it will just show you the ones that are available to access...

				DPR is asleep and has no idea that this glitch is on the system. As soon as he gets up it will get fixed.<br /><br />That&#039;s it!!&nbsp; I know it makes for better post from the people that always want to believe that LEO has DPR and the site. But DPR is away and does not know this is even happening. And as soon as he does it will get fixed.<br /><br />What is great&nbsp; isthat most of the people posting about this, would not even be on SR at this time. They would be in here trying to find the next post from a new vendor so they can get to them first and offer their great review service&nbsp; from a trusted forum member for a&nbsp; sample. <br /><br />These are the same members that post their own buyer stats in the signature so we all know they actually make purchases and not just spew the garbage post. Though by posting their stats they should realize we know they don&#039;t buy shit as no one would post there buyer stats. And since I just brought that up, could someone that does it please explain why they do it and answer if they feel like a total douche for doing it?

				It legitimately astounds me - FAR more than the actual globally publicized and absurdly accessible all purpose black market existing blatantly does - that people still have such an absurd sense of entitlement to this site. <br /><br />It could and might go down forever at any time, and if it did (and your bitcoins were also lost because you failed to keep even something like your wallet address), anyone with half a brain and their freedom would say &quot;that was great while it lasted - big ups to whoever kept it going.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never met DPR, and I highly doubt that anyone here has. Given that so far,&nbsp; he (or they for all we know) has seemingly been able to operate the site and ward off hackers, thieves, and highly advanced criminal organizations...all while receiving global press bringing the world to its front door. <br /><br />I think everyone needs to take a pretty big step back, try to think back to life before whatever introduction or experience you&#039;ve had to SR, and take things at their unpleasant but true face value. <br /><br />1. SR is a business, first and foremost. On top of that, it&#039;s an unprecedented illegal and undocumented business with no real analogy or comparison anyone can make or use. <br /><br />2. The technology behind the site (and Tor in general) is far beyond the understanding of 99.9% of people here, myself included. We hope it&#039;s safe, or that PGP is unbreakable, but likely have no conclusive proof of anything objective. <br /><br />3. It&#039;s currency is specifically and only a increasingly failing (but fundamentally brilliant in its conception) digital currency that has been repeatedly hacked or stolen with no known repercussions possible by anyone. There is not a single designated authority ensuring that Bitcoins, however you view them, remain protected and transparent. It&#039;s biggest downfall is the same reason for its success in way. <br /><br />The fact that the largest known botnet in the entire world uses 65% of its resources to mine/source bitcoins, instead of engaging in click fraud or long-term known high profit revenue streams says a huge amount about how much value elite online criminal organizations believe exists within the bitcoin marketplace. <br /><br />If you keep your head in the real world in regards to what the site is - and that by its own design remains secretive enough to keep even the most brilliant engineers or coders in the computing world speculating or patching together at best patchwork knowledge bases on its existence - I think you&#039;ll end up with a realistic and healthy view of what the &quot;big picture&quot; looks like. We&#039;re lucky every day it runs business as usual, and can only hope for it to remain as is for as long as it can. <br /><br />/rant<br /><br />

I don&#039;t &quot;want&quot; anyone to necessarily do anything except consider all possible scenarios. <br /><br />Source on botnet - google ZeroAccess, specifically a large PDF report by Sophos (on the nakedsecurity.sophos.com section). It&#039;s as close as you can get to having a fully transparent look at the controller&#039;s side of the botnet, along with what nearly equates to an instruction manual on how it works. It&#039;s fascinating in a way, but also somewhat terrifying given the eventual conclusion by security experts that for now it&#039;s omnipotent and more or less unstoppable in its current form. It&#039;s not hard to find, but given that you fucked up reading about 1 page worth of a forum post, I&#039;m dubious in your ability to read said PDF front to back. <br /><br />Lastly, I&#039;m not saying SR ruined Bitcoin - I&#039;m pointing out that while in many ways the idea of a limited release fiat currency with 100% transparency, at least at the wallet/block chain level, is fantastic in many ways, it&#039;s not perfect and its flaws are more apparent as time goes on. It&#039;s exploitable by people who I&#039;m guessing are willing to dedicate resources towards doing so.&nbsp; <br /><br />Read up on the countless BTC money changers, banks, or whatever you&#039;d like to call them, as a large amount of the early adopters of the idea either eventually stole their central holdings, or lost a huge chunk through a hack. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s happened, but of the ones I read about, most just closed up shop, or gave up after an attempted form of recouping the funds. If you need a source here, even the Wikipedia on Bitcoin is a decent start. <br /><br />In the context of SR specifically, Tony76 is probably the easiest and most well-known case that demonstrated the futility of chasing after stolen money through the block chain. Unless something happened after I stopped reading the thread, basically after running off with however much it ended up being it was just tracked as it changed from wallet to wallet. The transparency of the block chain just allowed those taken by him to watch coins moved around with little to no ability to do anything about it. Either way - SR and Bitcoin are strongly tied to each other, but are both incapable of causing the downfall of each other. <br /><br />You are correct - my experience on SR is basically when I bought 3 BTC from BTCKing&#039;s marked up BitInstant deposits and bought 2 rolls from the Netherlands and FE&#039;d immediately.&nbsp; We should all put our stats and vendor earnings (if applicable) in our signature to announce on a public forum what we do here, similar to the practice on the streets that involves having a Scarface poster and announcing that you&#039;re &quot;baller&quot; by adding some Blingee to your MySpace pics. <br /><br />It&#039;s just my opinion, and I would guess that of a fair amount of other people also interested in what the site represents on a larger scale, that a sense of entitlement and even something bordering on unconditional trust in any of the systems that make SR possible is at the very least dangerous. <br /><br />Agree to disagree - it&#039;s what opinions and forums are for.

				What I find strange is how the captcha are behaving. On the login in seems to only use the same 9 words: allo, marks, beso, shaft, jay, karma, legs, juno, fans. I remember it having a bigger selection of words before&nbsp; :-\ and stranger still is if you click to register a new account, the captcha behaves completely differently only showing 2 or 3 numbers (kinda like it was during the downtime a week ago).

				Boy this gets really tiring. Yeah, I know this is a godsenf, the site that is, but does it have to fail this often?<br /><br />Look as I said before, someone has got to put the pedal to the medal to get an up and running distributed, decentralized anonymous market that will work as is, out of the box, because most buyers and sellers (and I include myself) aren&#039;t computer-savvy enough to do more than a couple of tweaks here and there to make thigns like that go.<br /><br />A gnu-open source package that will work somewhat like SR (but fucking better, I hope)&nbsp; and will permit control of one&#039;s own account instantly, but with an option to do escrow if at all possible.

Colorado has the most liberal marijuana laws in the world, even more liberal than the Netherlands. <br /><br />The Netherlands is a UN member state and in order to get that status, it had to ratify the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Drugs, which explicitly bans marijuana. That&#039;s why it must keep pot illegal on the books while ignoring the law for small amounts in practice.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=82964.msg618452#msg618452">Quote from: MarcelKetman on November 23, 2012, 01:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.

The internet is much more than that. People were using email, usenet and FTP on the internet in the 1970s and 80s. Various protocols were created in the United States, United Kingdom, and France, but the first connection that implemented the TCP/IP protocols was between SRI (at Stanford) and UCLA, in 1969. That was the first link of the modern day internet, and it started in the United States.
