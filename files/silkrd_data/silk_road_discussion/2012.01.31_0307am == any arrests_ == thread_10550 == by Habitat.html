				So I did a few searches looking for any information regarding arrests that were directly linked to SR - either buyers or sellers - and I couldn&#039;t really find any (except arrests from regular internet forums - not .onions or private). So, has anyone ever heard of people getting arrested that were directly linked to SR?? obviously, any information would be greatly appreciated; and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one that happens to be curious about this....

				Of course the best information you&#039;re going to get is anecdotal, but I haven&#039;t heard of any (yet). Certainly nothing well publicized anyway.

				If there were any arrests you would not likely hear from said victims of drug war because they may be incarcerated/done with SR because of the fear/consequences.&nbsp; Arrests from SR vary from having product and reselling them in real life, them getting nabbed because of regular drug distribution.&nbsp; Arrests from having things sent to you on the spot is different, there is always plausible deniability.&nbsp; There have been crackdowns on certain people because they decided to ship in bulk (1+ pound), and even though plausible deniability is/was possible, they continued to do whatever they were doing even though there packages were seized, this leads to said person being monitored.&nbsp; While under being monitored and continuing spree of drug distribution, this is how an arrest will likely be made.

But I guess, considering I haven&#039;t - and most people haven&#039;t - really heard that much about arrests linked to SR is a GREAT thing. especially after the whole senator bullshit, where he pressured the FBI and DEA to crackdown on this site. and usually when you hear about a big bust in the paper or on TV, they do mention if it were a cartel, or internet forums, or just local small time college kids - so you would think they would directly mention SR (considering the rest of the press it has gotten). So I guess its a really good thing no one has really heard or read about any arrests directly related to SR

I think he was caught because of 2 things. 1. he was flagged for bringing in tons of chemicals from outside the country 2. he was snitched on. He did have over 120k on him, yet he had to get a public defender. (that was from the news article about his arrest). A guy with his volume needs to have a good chunk of money put a way in a safe place for a kick ass attorney/bond. If they found that amount in his possession, you would have to think that he has done millions in business. so one would have to conclude that he was a bad business man, etc. He use only one post office (apparently). He did many many things wrong.

				That bust was totally preventable too but he just didn&#039;t seem to care enough even after he was warned by friends/associates and had several incoming and outgoing packages intercepted. Instead of switching shit up he kept right at it without even changing his packaging and it got him taken down sadly. Sometimes the money makes people take risks they wouldn&#039;t otherwise take. Damn shame too because he used to have sheets on lock.

				it&#039;s called civil forfeiture here in the USA. If they find you in possession of cash when you go down for drugs/guns/hoes etc, without immediate proof it was made legitly, they can immediately seize the cash and any property they deem was gained from the illegal business being conducted. The real bitch about it is, since it&#039;s a &quot;civil&quot; forfeiture, it&#039;s up to the defendant to challenge it in court and carry the burden of proof (opposite of criminal proceedings). When they catch you with $100k+ it&#039;s difficult to dispute the seizure to put it mildly, especially when police here routinely seize stuff they have no chance in hell of proving was tied to illegal activity. Keep in mind also, he still ends up having to pay for the public defender eventually in the form of probation/parole fees or court ordered restitution to the state. If he knew he was busted, he may have feigned brokeness so they wouldn&#039;t keep snooping around and potentially find other funds he had stashed or hidden.
