				I have two thoughts on this.<br /><br />1- They will be seized and shut down, because that would be the final crushing blow to SR.<br /><br />or<br /><br />2-Allowed to operate, because this place is a treasure trove of information, on both vendors and many buyers who get very lax with what they post.

				DFG - Are you absolutely certain of that? <br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if these forums (fora?) were now compromised and the feds are hoping to grab contact details - presumably sent via PM as people attempt an orderly migration away from SR.<br /><br />SO - As with SR - just assume that the site is compromised and therefore use PGP if posting sensitive information to this site - even if it is in a PM.<br /><br />Do not post phone numbers or addresses etc. If you do post clearnet mail addresses then ONLY access them using TOR and make sure you never ever put any information in those clearnet mail accounts that can be attributed to you.<br /><br />Stay safe.

				Very certain, yes. I checked and refreshed several times and the same seized message appeared.&nbsp; Then I read an hour ago on reddit that it was back up. Very strange, obviously they are scanning this for further incriminating evidence, but as&nbsp; long as we keep it clean, we should be able to still use it for the migration. <br /><br />~DFG~

				The forums WILL go down eventually. Allowed to operate to gather intel and see migration plans. Maybe for hard dick fun for feds?<br /><br />DO NOT post sensitive information or PM sensitive info without GPG, as ALWAYS. Even DPR seem to not have used GPG for sensitive PM&#039;s. :(

I thought the forums were down to for a second. You just have to keep some of the forums up and then &quot;open in new tab&quot; if the page doesn&#039;t come up. I think it&#039;s just overloaded. Or if it&#039;s been seized then they are having a tough time keeping it up with all the traffic.
