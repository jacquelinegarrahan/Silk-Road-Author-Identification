				Hi buddy,<br /><br />Welcome to SR!<br /><br />SR&#039;s fees on seller&#039;s charges are as follows:<br /><br />10% on the first $50<br />8.5% on amounts of $50 - $150<br />6% on amounts of $150 - $300<br />3% on amounts of $300 - $500<br /><br />The commission is banded so for an item costing $110 (or the BTC equivalent) the commission would be $10.10 ($5 of the first $50 + $5.10 of the remaining $60).<br /><br />This can be a bit involved but SR does give you an option to list a price before seller fees are deducted, so you can just enter the price including your mark up and let the website do the rest.<br /><br />Please ask if you need anything else.<br /><br />V.

				The state of the road address says 1.5% for over $1,000. However When I do the math it&#039;s charging me a total of 3.64% which is a lot more than 1.5% + $5 for the first $50.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried doing the math 100 different ways and there is no way I can find to explain why the fee is so much. <br /><br />These figures on the state of the road address and the ones you provided seem to be wrong or I&#039;ve been getting ripped off, :|

				5+8.50+9+21=43.50 for the first 1000<br /><br />1500 would be $51 commission total, which is 3.4% cumulative<br /><br />you just have to follow the banding rule for the first $50, but follow it up until the commission drops to 1.5%<br /><br />so just add 43.50 to 1.5% of however much you are over 1000

If you&#039;re a bulk buyer it&#039;s the shiznit.
