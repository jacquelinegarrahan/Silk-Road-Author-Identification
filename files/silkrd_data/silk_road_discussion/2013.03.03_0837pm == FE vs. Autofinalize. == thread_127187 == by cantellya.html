				Hello all-<br />I&#039;ve placed a good sized international order- and I&#039;ve been told it can take up to 2 weeks and some change to arrive. Nothing yet, about to go on week #2. I see that the &quot;auto finalize&quot; function is ticking down, which has 12 days left on it. <br /><br />If it hasn&#039;t arrived within those 12 days- should I FE? or should I let it auto finalize? I think I will contact the vendor a few days before the auto finalize. I&#039;m worried that if the package doesn&#039;t make it and I FE, or autofinalize, that I will be out my BTC. Any advice? Thank you muchly.<br /><br />CTY

				Happy to help - just know that because you enter resolution doesnt mean it is some evil thing that is destine to come out badly.<br /><br />It often is just a way to extend the transit time.<br /><br /><br />As a vendor I stress communicate with your vendor about what is going on and how you feel about it and the actions you are thinking of taking.<br /><br />Be reasonable and give the vendor a fair amount of time to respond - but act before your time runs out - even if it is only an ext to begin with.<br />

				Best of all, it&#039;s good that you stayed within escrow. The only thing you lose is time and patience. <br />

As a vendor sometimes there&#039;s alot going on so sending a nice, simple message about the transaction with the vendor, after waiting a reasonable amount of time, should get you on the right path to smoothing out the order.

				Is there a thread about resolution center somewhere? I&#039;m in RC right now, and I proposed a resolution that hasn&#039;t been accepted or challenged yet. If the allotted time runs out, does my resolution win?
