				<br />I saw that his package was delivered with no problems through the tracking yesterday. This was a methylone order, I have NEVER had one confiscated, the stealth is impeccable. This bastard is trying to get a freebie and get refunded 50 percent. He had his house raided but just comes on Silk Road casually the next day and asks for a refund exceeding 50 %. What a fucken bastard never dealt with a customer this shitty. <br /><br />DEAAGENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey!<br /><br />I just came back from the police station, where I spent the night... The package was picked up by Norwegian customs, who sent it to the police. Yesterday an undercover police officer dressed as a postman came to my house with the package. I signed for it, and then three or four more officers burst in the door. They searched my house, and I was questioned today. Needless to say, this sucks big time for me; I hope you would be willing to help me out with a refund exceeding 50%, but I understand that you are running a business and need to cover your expenses.<br /><br />Lastly, I have proof of what&#039;s happened to me. I can upload a picture of the warrant for my arrest when I get the chance!<br /><br />Thank you

				haha this mad eme laugh as well, I mean Sam are you even going to write back on the thread you started? <br />what was out of the order about what the guy said to you ? he was very polite, He got arrested , He has proof of it and he probably has to pay for a new door Lmfao! <br />And you are grudging giving the guy HALF of his money back, he basically paid you to get him busted. I looked at all the people who said you have scammed them and to be honest im not sure if they are all telling the truth or whatever but im definitely never buying from you&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />You actually started a full thread to slander this guy and it&#039;s now gunna end up a thread where people talk about how much of a scammer you are. <br />What made you send a package to somebody called DEAAGENT anyway hahahaha you have to be kidding me.
