				All I know is I knew this really cool older dude who once had 170 acre farm of maryjane and did very well.&nbsp; He retired and had a huge ranch but his wife kept flipping kilos, and he warned she would get busted.&nbsp; Well when she did she narked on him for everything prior to his retirement and he still got 9 years.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know him anymore because it was just random that I met him when he was here building some intense buildings.&nbsp; His connections and good deeds (and amazing intelligence) earned him a good job when he got out.&nbsp; How does the rico work?

				Apparently the RICO act allows for extended penalties as consequence from Organized Crime, and other Federal Crimes. Originally it was created to be used on members of the Mafia, and Biker gangs such as the Hell&#039;s Angels.
