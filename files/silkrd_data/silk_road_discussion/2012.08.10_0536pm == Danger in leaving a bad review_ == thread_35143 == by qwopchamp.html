				Hypothetical question here folks.<br /><br />Say I purchase something on the road, and the product is horrible, the service is bad, or the seller is simply scamming me.<br />My worry is that by giving a horrible seller a bad review, he may blackmail me knowing a) that I participate in the activities of this website and b) what my address and name is; here,&nbsp; I am merely pointing out the fact that the seller knows crucial information about me, which given to LE could be very bad. <br /><br />How do I improve the community by giving negative criticism when it&#039;s needed without fearing retribution from the seller? Are there measures to protect a buyer&#039;s anonymity when it comes to sellers knowing who left which review for which product?

				You will be fine just make sure it&#039;s a legit reason if you do.&nbsp; Most vendors delete the address after they use it.

				Ive been thinking of the same, how it feels a tad riscy giving out an address connected to me (or even my home address) to some gangster drug dealer. Hopefully they see no reason to inflict harm though..&nbsp; but, never know how/who/what ppl use an address for for whatever reason..<br /><br />&quot;product is horrible&quot;, thats another thing Ive been a bit nervous about, but hopefully wont ever happen-&nbsp; I read some newspaper here that Heroin polluted with Anthrax bacteria has been found around Europe, there was atleast a death in Denmark (and Scotland? unsure).<br />Such polluted Heroin could be very tempting to a seller knowing they could anonymously sell it for many times the price, even in small amounts for quick cash, and wont be noticed most of the time (unless someone inject/sniff stuff with bacteria on it, reports it etc. to get attention to it and SR as the source). Any way the seller wouldnt lose anything besides his registration fee if he kept secure, it seems pretty easy to deal dirty drugs like that..&nbsp; Hopefully some good reasons ppl arent tho, and noone ever wanna risc their reputation like that..&nbsp; but Im afraid it will happen some day, as easy/possible as it seems when everyone is anonymous like this?

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much danger in that because the vendor would probably be incriminating himself by doing that.

				You shouldn&#039;t be worried to leave a bad review if you feel this is the right thing to do. <br /><br />here&#039;s a thread you should read: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34441.15<br /><br />in a nutshell: you do a disservice to the community if you had a bad experience and yet leave a positive feedback. Other buyers need to know who they are ordering from.

				if you have a genuine complaint especially if the product is complete bunk or they are trying to scam you or any other genuine reason and they dont sort it out for you asap, then leave them negative feedback, thats what the feedback system is for, its how we can do our research and weed the shitty vendors with good product and practices for the shitty vendors that are selective scammers or just dont give a fuck and tell lies, the more buyers give shit vendors good feedback, the more they will keep up there shitty practices of treating customers badly.

Only rely on the forum. Completely ignore the feedback on SR. Unless there&#039;s a lot of bad feedback already, that&#039;s never a good sign. A lot of buyers will trade positive feedback for a refund of some sort. I can&#039;t blame anyone for that, but it makes the feedback system useless of course. I also do that sometimes, no one can afford to get ripped off all the time, but I never change a review in the forum. If I don&#039;t go for refund I try to make the statement as clear and as short and as powerful as possible to make the vendor lose as much customers as possible. But then again I am not afraid to piss vendors off, they are also not afraid to scam their buyers (this can backfire quite a bit also). I regularly make vendors look bad in the forums by reviewing their products. <br /><br />I think/hope that together with the other reviewers we had quite a bit of an impact in the sales of shitty vendors and forwarded the demand to the good vendors. That&#039;s the only practicable way to survive here unfortunately.

				If your order is bunk, hunt down the vendor and kill him. If you still are frustrated aftet that, leave a 1/5

				Use a different forum name to post under.<br /><br />And be prepared for the vendor to use different accounts to get on there and tell you you&#039;re full of shit, and jack up your negative karma.

				I would like to chime in...<br /><br />Just wanted to give every complaining ass dickless butthurt faggot with a hair stuck up their ass a big FUCK YOU!!!<br /><br />I am pretty new and out of roughly 150 transacs I have two monkey faggots who left negative feedback for no other reason other then being a bitch.&nbsp; <br /><br />One fucker claimed he never received a large shipment but his DCN listed as delivered....jewed me out of a free reship...claimed the second one never got there, the second listed as delivered and then left me a bad review claiming I may be a reverse scammer, what a piece of shit this scamming motherfucker is...he had like a 89/0 rating and was like....well it cant be me man, look I never had a chargeback so I cant be wrong, you have trust me...<br /><br />The second bitch motherfucker lef tme a negative review after he said I sent him the wrong shit.&nbsp; He ordered a lower grade and wanted to upgrade, so he did by sending me 5$ less then the weed he wanted was worth...then when he gets it, he claims that I still sent him the wrong grade, cause what I sent him does not match the pictures...I did send him the higher grade strain it just looked a tint darker from original because its a diff pheno of the plant...still just as good, its still smells the same and looks generally the same, but the fucking faggot chose to talk shit and give me a bad review cause he is a stupid thoughtless bitch. <br /><br />The rest of my reviews are amazing and I am really grateful for all the cool people that get their stuff and are happy...the rest of my feedback hopefully speaks for itself.
