				hi, i have some noob questions - sorry if this is the wrong section could not find the answers to these questions though and was not sure where else to post<br /><br />1. what is the safest way to purchase btc? - i used moneygram<br />1a. if moneygram or if any other way asks for some personal info should you make it all fake?<br />1b. best local store to exchange cash for btc with little hassle? - I DO NOT recommend the red phone for moneygram, blue forms are much quicker<br /><br />2. should you use your real name for the address you mail your goods to im guessing yes but i am not sure<br />2a. so i&#039;m not sure if this is true but if you&#039;re asked to sign for a package that means it&#039;s been discovered and you can get sent to jail/fined if you agree to sign it, right?<br />2b. if someone else signed for your package that lives in your house would they suffer the consequences?<br /><br />3. what is FEing?<br /><br />sorry if i made any mistakes - any other pro tips/links general walkthrough would be apperciated for the whole process of getting bitcoins to successfully making a purchase<br /><br />thanks! i look forward to getting to know everyone here on SR&nbsp; ;D

				1) cash bank deposits through bitinstant is one way - no name or anything needed<br /><br />2) recommended to use your real name or else the package may not be delivered<br />&nbsp;- you should never sign if you werent expecting to have to. some orders, such as express from CA to US require signature and some will sign since they are expecting, others just wont order express, but tracking enables refunds in many situations<br />&nbsp;- if you get a controlled deliver your entire household is fucked. they will search everything, everyone and all computers will be taken if they suspect any illegal electronic activity<br /><br />3) FE = finalize early, this means releasing the funds from escrow before you receive the order. this is dangerous and not recommended. i wont support vendors who require FE although especially new buyers are sometimes asked to in order to protect the vendor from scams as well

Though you will never need to signing for a package means nothing. It does not lead to getting in trouble or anything like that. I believe I ship the most USPS Express packages out of the USA vendors.&nbsp; And I always sign the box to waive the signature, I also have a sticker they provide that I stick on to let the carrier know that no signature is required. Yet they are so used to asking for it that they have asked to have it signed for. When the customer got it inside he saw how I had waived it and he was panicking. Well I finally talked him off the edge and explained if he is &quot;busted&quot;&nbsp; then he has nothing to lose...though there is no way he is..So I told him to ask the postman why he had to sign for it..And the postman told him that he was just used to asking and he totally spaced it.<br /><br />Now this was his first order off SR..That&#039;s how I knew it was just a mistake.

Ever. So You Have Nothing To Worry About If You Are Smart And Cautious.<br /><br />If you are ordering a few pills off here that is different then A pound of weed. I think you can see the risk and the difference. Just choose your vendor carefully. Read there vendor page. Message them right before you order and tell them you are new and you are going to order xxx. Then ask them if they indeed have it in stock, if it is early enough to ship out that day, and if they have any other &quot;rules&quot;. Doing that is always a good idea. Not messaging them days before but when you are actually ready.<br /><br />That also save you from ordering from a vendor that is not around. If you send a message explaining everything I said and you don&#039;t get&nbsp; a response ..is a lot better then them having your money and not responding.<br /><br />Yes there is some valuable information in here. There is a lot more reading the vendor page and reading ALL of the vendors feedback. Just be smart and patient and ask every question you have before you start to ordering. Like your doing. And use common sense.<br /><br />~Good Luck~
