				This issue is my biggest concern as I consider whether or not to sell on SR. Well, okay not my BIGGEST concern, lol... But a close second, I guess.&nbsp; Avoiding somehow the buyers who are scammers.

				Um, guys this is exactly what the &#039;rumor mill&#039; section of the forum is for. Most of the scammers have a thread started about them already. Just check there before you buy.

				This is one of the many reasons I think there should be a 2nd, invite only SR. Kind of like pulling a TFM but make it mods only who can invite, not authentication.

I have way more than 2 transactions, but if a seller asked that of me - or if I asked that as a seller - I&#039;d think it&#039;s sensible to do so. Safety is the number one concern. Risks for sellers and buyers are shared almost evenly. One hand washes the other here.<br /><br />Releasing funds early is something I do ALWAYS for my trusted sellers. The bottleneck is too much for them sometimes.<br /><br />All they are trying to do is move it, get it to you, and cash out. Legitimate sellers, IMO, should have this agenda and this agenda only.<br /><br />This includes excellent, discreet packaging, security, and lets never forget about good communication. <br /><br />Lack of communication and/or rudeness is INTOLERABLE from a buyer OR a seller.<br /><br />The minute it starts, irreversible waves are made between seller and buyer, or vice versa.<br /><br />I admit to e-bitch slapping anyone who&#039;s been rude - and it&#039;s not good to do that.<br /><br />Lets just say it&#039;s in my blood, how I grew up, and where I grew up. I take no shit from anyone, and will lay it on thick if you test me.<br /><br />But honestly this just starts a vicious circle. Even I must learn to be tolerant even though someone is pissing me off.<br /><br />Keep it civil and lets let our trust between each other- our guide.<br /><br />If you find a seller is trying to scam / lie to you - kill them with kindness.<br /><br />They have no recourse but to come clean, or just stop talking to you.<br /><br /><br />L75

				I consider myself lucky, I&#039;ve had 100% successful transactions = I have perfect feedback (that comes from being honest from day 1), and found my favorite sellers without being ripped off, or any bad transactions. I did this by coming to the forums, reading feedback, and careful reading of their descriptions, and finally, just a &#039;gut feeling&#039;. <br /><br />Also, because I don&#039;t use everything for sale on here, I just have one or two vices, I don&#039;t have to keep looking for other sellers, unless someone with overwhelming quality and/or lower price comes along. Even then, just one shitty transaction would probably leave too sour a taste in my mouth and send me packing.<br /><br />

				I have also been lucky to have great honest buyers and sellers to deal with.<br /><br />I strongly believe in karma and eventually these scammers will get what&#039;s coming to them. They have NO place here.

				I have instituted a rule myself that any buyer with &lt;3 transactions has to purchase the item out-of-escrow.&nbsp; If any buyer has more than 10% refund rate they have to message me before they buy to see if we can work something out (down payment out of escrow etc.).&nbsp; So far I&#039;ve had 3 new buyers purchase out of escrow so I&#039;m happy with it - they want their product, they are willing to buy it honestly, and my reputation is enough to demonstrate I&#039;m going to do everything in my power to get their produc to them.<br /><br />I think the new buyer info (which was my suggestion :) is fantastic and it offers a lot more transparency, rewards consistency, and encourages long-term relationships without compromising any privacy.&nbsp; It&#039;s win-win.
