				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />We are happy to announce a brand new site called The Armory.&nbsp; It focuses exclusively on the sale of small-arms weaponry for the purpose of self defense.<br /><br />The issue of whether weapons should be sold on Silk Road has been brought up and debated too many times to count.&nbsp; I have heard good arguments on both sides of the debate and had to really think hard before choosing to take this direction.&nbsp; Here is a brief summary of my thoughts on the matter and why I chose to spin-off a new site rather than ban weapon sales completely, or allow them to continue here:<br /><br />First off, we at Silk Road have no moral objection to the sale of small-arm weaponry.&nbsp; We believe that an individual&#039;s ability to defend themselves is a cornerstone of a civil society.&nbsp; Without this, those with weapons with eventually walk all over defenseless individuals.&nbsp; It could be criminals who prey on others, knowing they are helpless.&nbsp; It could be police brutalizing people with no fear of immediate reprisal.&nbsp; And as was seen too many times in the last century, it could be an organized government body committing genocide on an entire unarmed populace.&nbsp; Without the ability to defend them, the rest of your human rights will be eroded and stripped away as well.<br /><br />That being said, there is no reason we have to force everyone into a one-size-fits-all market where one group has to compromise their beliefs for the benefit of another.&nbsp; That&#039;s the kind of narrow thinking currently used by governments around the world.&nbsp; It&#039;s why we are in this mess in the first place.&nbsp; The majority in many countries feel that drugs and guns should be illegal or heavily regulated, so the minority suffers.<br /><br />Here at Silk Road, we recognize the smallest minority of all, YOU!&nbsp; Every person is unique, and their human rights are more important than any lofty goal, any mission, or any program.&nbsp; An individual&#039;s rights ARE the goal, ARE the mission, ARE the program.&nbsp; If the majority wants to ban the sale of guns on Silk Road, there is no way we are going to turn our backs on the minority who needs weaponry for self defense.<br /><br />So, without further ado, I give you our answer to this whole conundrum:<br /><br />The Armory: ayjkg6ombrsahbx2.onion<br /><br />The Armory is run on the same codebase that runs Silk Road, with all of the same features you know and love.&nbsp; However, it is run completely independently with it&#039;s own servers, Bitcoin wallets, databases, etc.&nbsp; If it becomes popular, we&#039;ll even look into putting it under separate management.<br /><br /><br />A note to vendors: If you have items in the Silk Road weapons category, please relist them at The Armory asap.&nbsp; We will be shutting down weapons sales on Silk Road on Sunday March 4th.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJPSt5DAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olO9IH/jIH9+bqUjakcOSbbOxqKe7g<br />lGBQwpNdTVcvyi/5/EX7Y6DtJs3sR5OhQpXoeQHI+aGvNoF+iUrot0TiYmiTDa72<br />cBI3AD9TaxrbLuuuKhNuXTQ3BhoZMKx8VLdLK6HallllTW9Qwn5Fp2lr54tOV29a<br />BQXvhqfibg7+BZRM38yZJT/GFw2+FCjxMnp3o6oD/nXDrYDqtRJjfuas4Yad3JkB<br />owsH3+mZO014//UuLawUqJ/EKU7GA1xZ+YXy2fgn6U+hHNH9STLGXj3klHKgN8QV<br />KsoP/fxpiGeZyUprkVUarCs1LtSNHBsbiz+MzsaTYltVwSagZId+3X33n7AH2Mo=<br />=+nt5<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

				excellent plan, segregating the weapons trading from silk road may take displace some of the &quot;heat&quot; aimed at this community. however it still feels like a ticking time bomb. *pun*<br /><br />how long before silk road / armory grows to a size substantial enough for governments to be able to justify imposing stronger internet privacy laws? no one wants another sopa/acta scare. we see it happening with megaupload, soon enough pirate bay. the only way to stay out of their control is to stay a few steps ahead in the technology race. i think they have a lot of catching up to do, but lets keep moving! so far, so good fellas.

				I like the thinking behind this idea, perfect solution and revolutionary as well. I would hope the server locations of the 2 sites are VERY far apart from eachother. I would hate to see S.R. go down because of a weapons site..This is something that has never been tried, and it is going to attract and ungodly amount of attention if the right people hop on board and do it in a smart manner. I hope everyone is ready, the spotlight is on and we are about to be in for a ride either way..Turn up the paranoia people and lock your shit down and check your vendors, shit could go any where from here. S.R. is going to be affiliated with the new Weapons Site, and thats when governments start to notice wherever you go, and start to look hard and put money towards it.<br /><br />Buckle up,<br /><br />-NS 8)

				Also a last minute possibility Beta Test..I would have spoken amongst the community for those members who are associated with Pro-Gun opinions, and outsourced yourself some start up vendors that are already Veteran here that can be trusted and allow them to authorize other sellers, and buyers with custom logins on an Invite Only Basis. Guns being especially a touchy subject to deal with especially, even with Escrow, that doesn&#039;t guarantee its not LEO on the other side because this is the opportunity that LEO looks for and we amongst the community could better verify our own. I guess everyone can take their own chances, but I think security could be stepped up here especially since we have learned lessons since SR&#039;s infancy that we can apply to the Weapons Site to better it. Its brand new, lock it down now to those we know better..Try to take the BTC&#039;s out of the eyes for a minute..<br /><br />-NS

				This is just such an elegant solution on so many different levels. It&#039;s literally BRILLIANT.<br /><br />Unintended side-effect, a lot of different government agencies won&#039;t be able to share funding for joint operations anymore mwahahaha. (Think DEA/ATF joint taskforces etc., nuh uh not no more for this Road bishes).<br /><br />I am really extremely pleased with this decision, it was a very very smart move. No more &quot;Want a Glock with your Crack&quot; sensationalist headlines anymore either.<br /><br />I&#039;m literally BEAMING here....

				Speaking for Ben and myself, we&#039;re just glad to see the guns have their own place and not be mixed in with the other products.<br /><br />We know we will take heat for being on SR and that&#039;s part of what we signed up for when we came here.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t, however, want to or anticipate, taking heat also for the sales of guns or anything else really other than drug products.<br /><br />There is plenty of attention on SR without adding the guns to the mix so we applaud your solution and are very glad you&#039;ve implemented it.<br /><br />Now we can go back to just taking the huge amount of heat that we get for selling what we sell already! haha! ;)<br /><br />Alex

I have guns for self defense, in the event that my life, or the lives of people that I care about, is threatened. I have my concealed carry permit, to be able to carry legally (although I generally don&#039;t carry), and I am lucky that I have the option to legally purchase a firearm for those reasons. Not everyone has that capability. In my opinion, firearms give people the opportunity to protect their personal freedom and life, they give people an even playing field, so that when somebody breaks into a 60 year old woman&#039;s house, she has a chance to defend herself. <br /><br />I realize that not everyone uses firearms for that reason, but personally, out of everyone I know who owns guns, there isn&#039;t a single person who would ever use one to willingly harm another person. I agree that I don&#039;t really get a very good gut reaction when I think about firearms being sold on a site like this, but it really isn&#039;t extremely different than purchasing one at many gun shows that require no background checks. It makes it a little shadier I suppose, since the majority of items on here are illegal, but when I think of who would mostly be purchasing firearms to commit violence, I think of people in ghettos and lower class areas, who mostly won&#039;t be finding their way onto this site, and would most likely have an easier time buying illegal weapons in person. Maybe I&#039;m completely off base, I hope not, because it&#039;d be a shame IMO to see this site start being used for malicious purposes.

				Also, this is something that should be watched carefully.&nbsp; If an account over on The Armory has the same seller name as someone over here, use PGP to verify that it&#039;s actually the same person as over here.&nbsp; At the very least, PM that vendor account over here and wait for them to respond with &quot;yup it&#039;s me&quot; before you do any business over on the Armory.<br /><br />And the community as a whole needs to keep a very vigilant eye on sellers over on Armory.&nbsp; Items are higher risk, in that they are larger and more easily intercepted (I would recommend component shipping, myself, over several packages), and price tags are higher, meaning scammers will most likely abound.<br /><br />Anarcho47

				&nbsp;I think this was a good decision to maintain separate sites .&nbsp; BUT<br /><br />...Good Lord, the number of self-professed &#039;liberty advocates&#039;&nbsp; on here -- in favor of gun control is astounding and depressing.<br /><br />Are you gun-control fools unaware of 20th century history?&nbsp; The millions that have died at the hands of tyrannical governments -- after they have been disarmed under the bleating platitudes of the mindless sheep like yourselves?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There is a REASON that the 2nd Amendment to the Bill of Rights contains an INDIVIDUAL right to bear arms -- in fact this was considered not only a God-given right, but a civic duty in the late 1700s.&nbsp; &nbsp;This because the founders of America understood that an individual right to bear arms was the last defense against tyranny.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I understand and agree that the sites should be separate -- and personally I would not be so unwise as to buy weapons on the internet -- but I suggest all the gun-control morons go read The Gulag Archipelago by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn.&nbsp; Then think about what you would do if the modern-day NKVD secret police came to haul you off, or to haul your mother away, or to murder your father in the middle of the night.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you think that this part of history will never repeat?&nbsp; That you are immune from the effects of psychopaths seizing political power?&nbsp; &nbsp;That you are &#039;safe&#039; because you have done nothing wrong?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Think again.&nbsp; History will repeat.&nbsp; Once day , probably sooner than you realize, there will be secret police, secret trials, neighbors hauled away under the cover of night, truthfully screaming out their innocence -- but no one will come to their aid -- as they are hauled away without justice to sprawling gulags.&nbsp; It might be 2 years, it might be 20 years, but it will happen again.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And you going to hide in your apartment, defenseless and ashamed ,&nbsp; that you did nothing?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;....&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t surprise me at all.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin&#039;s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt!

				While folks are arguing whether The Armory is going to draw heat or not, the big question remains if it is going to take off or not. Personally, I see it suffering the fate of Black Market Reloaded if Admins don&#039;t act and adopt some fundamental changes. Why the hell are seller accounts free over there? It should NOT be allowed to advertise with 50/50 out of escrow transactions (the standard scam) and buyers should be educated on that.<br />It&#039;s all about creating solid and healthy foundations. Any legitimate vendors in that field will think twice about getting involved, and they will have zero incentive to do so if the place has a questionable reputation with 90% scammers.

WTF use is a slide to him if he don&#039;t have the rest of the pistol?<br /><br />I know guns. A slide from one 1911 (for example) will never fit another 1911 (or rarely) of a different maker. See what I,m saying?<br />No reason for the buyer to scam thus no reason for the seller not to escrow in 3 to 4 parts. The 3 bits (slide, barrel, body and recoil spring/springs etc but won&#039;t count them) go together<br />like a jigsaw. The magazine (clip for you G&#039;s) can be bought legally anyway. Escrow or go wank,.

				Guys, I&#039;ve been following the developments on the Armory for a while now and can only refer you back to my post #57 on the previous site. It is quickly becoming a huge mess and ugly parody of BlackMarketReloaded (the scammer money is all too real and anything but funny, unfortunately). Even if the affiliation with SR is still loose at this point, the Armory as it exists now is not worthy to be part of the SR family. And this isn&#039;t something that will straighten out with time. Scammers and trolls are wreaking havoc! A first step at cleaning up would be making vendors pay for their accounts, no idea why this was waived in the first place. Maybe DPR is already working on those things and what we see now is something like an alpha release of the Armory...?

				Great, excellent, very handy and all that.<br />I myself have been put into a home invasion situation with some prick which had a baseball bat, balaklava, who was going to put across my head, lucky I had a matic handle to block.<br />But at my age and on a pension for a bad back. Something that went bang, pointed in the air at least for the first initial welcome, would have been handy. But at least he fled as I was not giving up my house that I have worked so long and hard to get.<br /><br />Only prob I can see is me, living in Aussie, is how in the heck would it get past cutoms.<br /><br />Anyway GOOD LUCK and cheers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Having a weapon does&#039;nt mean your a criminal.

				So I just registered for the Armorary to check it out. I had just logged in for the very first time and I show that I have purchased a lottery ticket for a handgun and it shows in transit. Is this some kind of freebie for new users or what. I never even transfered any coin to the site and show and order already. Kind of concerns me. <br /><br />Thanks

No, they hire the government to kill everyone they disagree with. &quot;I like drugs, but I hate guns&quot; is the mantra of shit-for-brains.<br /><br />But anyway....<br /><br />When is this new site going to be functional and not suck horribly? I&#039;ve got all kinds of cool shit I could sell there...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Tools to stand up to them? I doubt you live in a totalitarian society characterized by random government sanctioned murder. The governments beyond the bubble of the USA will pay attention because the rest of the world do not carry firearms, and sites like the Armory are only going to provide a means for armed crime to proliferate; in the UK knife crime is bad enough, i do NOT want chavs to have access to firearms or even non-lethal weaponary. If the armory would like to provide non-lethal social cleansing services i may be interested.. <br /><br />Re &quot;I like drugs but i hate guns being the mantra of cowardly hypocrites&quot;; If the entirety of the drug using community of the UK were happily supplied with their favorite psychoactive of choice, thier drugs will forever stay in thier own blood; never to enter a non-drug user&#039;s body, respecting those not involved&#039;s rights and autonomy. Whilst if every firearm seeking (nutcase) in the UK were to be supplied with their very own shiney 9mm, the bullets of which they would possess are *intrinsically designed to enter another non-consenting individual&#039;s body*, thus in effect imposing this ridiculous American concept of some fucking &quot;constitutional right&quot; to what is really citizen level mutually assured destruction, where apparently carrying more and more weaponry makes you safer. <br /><br />I love the silk road, but the armory i do not, id rather see a coup d&#039;etat with tabs of LSD and pure truth, than middle class kids wearing some fucking che guevara t-shirt screaming about down with the fascists brandishing firearms and being part of the same pathetic mentality that believes violence solves anything. <br /><br />But im just standing up for the cowardly hypocrites here, please continue as you were.

				Canada has more small arms than the USA? Lol what is that guy smoking.<br />Most American weapons are made there, how many Canadian gun manufacturing corporations are there compared to US?<br /><br />In Arizona there is no waiting period, registration or limits to how many weapons you can buy. Any non felon can sign a background check and buy a dozen glocks on the spot with 30+ round magazines and walk out the door. Phoenix it&#039;s dead easy to order anonymous weapons online completely legally, there is no need for the Armory in the US. <br /><br />http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/46316454/ns/today-today_rossen_reports/t/rossen-reports-anyone-can-buy-guns-no-questions-asked/#.T5trHWHLfQE<br /><br />Armory exists for foreign countries primarily because when you get licenses in those countries you end up in a police database and they can search your residence whenever they want to make sure you still have the gun, it&#039;s secured, and you haven&#039;t done anything illegal to it like taking out the pin in the magazine (Canada). They often don&#039;t enforce this law but it&#039;s a nice little fascist loophole they can take advantage of should they need an excuse to harass you.<br /><br /><br /><br />

You can buy vehicular tanks, which don`t have any artillery on them, to drive one though you would probably need to get it registered (if possible) and have lots of free lands to run around one. While I can understand some people`s fascination with such weapons I sometime wonder if really is a necessity for the norm. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think any weapon that is not a direct threat to national security should be sold. A direct threat is weapons of mass destruction. Hell if you have enough money and you want some F 15 Eagles fuck it buy em. If you feel the need for sniper rifles or whatever crazy shit and you have the money to pay whatever buy it. Weapons are not evil or bad. On the contrary, governments that fear the day when their people will become armed are bad. Weapons are liberating :)<br /><br />Another solid point about weapons and terrorism to mention: Hand guns and even assault rifles are not terrorist weapons. Tanks and armored cars arnt terrorist weapons either. Terrorist weapons are things like bombs and Boeing jets. So I say we ban the sale of bombs and jets.
