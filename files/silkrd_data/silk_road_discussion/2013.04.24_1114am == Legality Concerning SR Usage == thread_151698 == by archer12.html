				I was just thinking is it actually illegal to use SR because there are legal products for sale?<br /><br />Also if LE were to ever catch up to you, they would have to prove that you have purchased illegal material from the site in order to prosecute, something which would be harder to prove

				Yes i a sure that purchasing the stuff is illegal, but my question is whether accessing it in general is illegal. <br /><br />The only way LE could prosecute is if they could prove that a purchase of illegal stuff was made and if that is the case wouldn&#039;t it be better to not have an order history

				I don&#039;t really see what they could charge you with, though maybe they&#039;d try. TBH, I don&#039;t really see how they might catch you and &#039;prove&#039; you were ever on SR unless they caught you with something and then found evidence on your PC that showed you were on SR, but then they&#039;d already have you for possession or something. Also, AFAIK, you can only be prosecuted for possession of drugs, or for possession with intent to supply, so you can&#039;t get charged for taking drugs (though they can hold you in a cell until you come down) unless you then go on to do something dumb, like drive a car...&nbsp; ???

				It would be so nice to have a legal opinion on this.&nbsp; How is it different than shopping at eBay or kijiji and seeing a mix of llegal isting and a few illegal listings in the list beyond your control?&nbsp; <br /><br />There are lots of products there that are only legal in some countries too.&nbsp; It would definitely go to trial for debate. This site is revolutionary in other ways too. Challenging laws and defences.<br /><br />So browsing mist be legal and freedom of expression.&nbsp; I would think that by joining the site though, you are associating with a gang or illegal group or expressing your intent to buy or ship&nbsp; same if you have coins on the site. <br /><br />Just an open discussion.<br />

Further, how would they then access your account to see if you had BTC there? I just don&#039;t see how they might compile evidence to prosecute you for browsing on SR without ever getting evidence for anything else first...

				Is your ISP not capable of seeing whether you are accessing SR, knowing all the laws going around nowadays, in some cases they may have to give that info over to LE<br /><br />That&#039;s why i was thinking simply just having an account, you haven;t broken any laws

				Many folks use SR accounts as online wallets to store BTCs. Especially since instawallet went down, blockchain.info and SR are the two most reliable online wallets (in terms of attacks withstood). <br /><br />...At least that&#039;s how I&#039;d explain it to my lawyer.

You can find an explanation of it here:<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en<br /><br />And I would point out that in the pics shown the feed-out is un-encrypted - this doesn&#039;t matter with SR since SR is a hidden TOR site and so there is no feed-out of the TOR network.<br /><br />I have heard that the only way to &#039;prove&#039; that you have accessed a specific website through TOR (without directly monitoring your PC monitor or finding incriminating data on your HDD) is to monitor your internet connection and the connection at the server you&#039;re accessing and run a statistical analysis - again impossible to do with SR....<br /><br />It is of course a totally different situation if you&#039;re stupid enough to access through tor2web&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />

				Unless you can think of a law that you&#039;re actually breaking by being here then what you&#039;re doing is not illegal. &quot;Hanging out in a dodgy area&quot; isn&#039;t a crime, though it may help prove beyond reasonable doubt that you have broken some law or other.

				Visiting and browsing: legal*<br />Purchasing, selling: illegal. <br /><br />*illegal in countries that block TOR. <br /><br />Vistiing and browsing, could make you a person of interest if they could tell that you were visiting and browsing.

				It&#039;s perfectly legal to buy the legal items here.<br />If you buy a bike from a drug dealer down the street, the police aren&#039;t going to arrest you for buying items from a known drug dealer - unless it was stolen property.<br />If you only used this site for legal purchases, in any western country you could tell the police you were using Silk Road and the worst they could do is hold you for questioning and obtain a warrant to search your home.

				Being on SR is absolutely not illegal in any way shape or form. Remember those crotchedy old senators accessing SR on a news program and thundering about how this needs to be shut down? Was that senator in question breaking the law on national tv? Or the countless journalists who have written about SR and their experiences browsing around? Did they all just implicate themselves in crime?<br /><br />You can use SR as a web wallet for BTC. You can use SR to purchase books, porn or other such novelty goods. All perfectly legal.<br /><br />Purchasing drugs on the other hand.. is a different story.<br /><br />Is it illegal to walk around a neighborhood with known crackhouses on every corner? Not at all.<br />Buying the crack on the other hand... is a different story.<br /><br />You get the point..
