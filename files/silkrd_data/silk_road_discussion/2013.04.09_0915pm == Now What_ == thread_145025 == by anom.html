				So its a feeling Ive avoided for apparently too long, my first SR hangover.&nbsp; Getting scammed might be the worst feeling ever, particularly when the money scammed wasnt even yours, but instead belonged to some people you really dont want to owe money you dont have to.<br /><br />If you take nothing else from this post, DONT FE EVER.<br /><br />So, how do my fellow scamees deal with the depression that SR is not that utopia I have imagined it as for the year Ive been involved.&nbsp; How do I regain the confidence to send a MP number to someone who has the decision whether to scam me in their hands?&nbsp; And finally, how do I track down and kill xanax bar?<br /><br />fuck. had to vent a bit.

				I just past my one year birthday on here, and I&#039;ll still FE, if the feeling is right. Usually someone who only takes that form of payment, and is well established. <br /><br />The one thing I&#039;ve never done, is buy a moneypak and then give someone the secret code.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />That being said, if it were for bitcoins, and it was a reputable seller like Sugar Mama, and BitInstant was on the Fritz, I&#039;d probably consider it. <br /><br />It all comes down to what is an acceptable risk. Of course that&#039;s relative to how comfortable you are financially. <br /><br />I&#039;m one of the soon to be extinct middle class of Americans. The Bourgeoisie, if you will. Scoffed at by the ruling class of today&#039;s politburo.<br /><br />In life we sometimes have to take a few lumps. - Been burned a sensibly 3 times in the past year. Some just never arrived, and after some ugly experiences in going to resolution. Being called a &#039;scammer&#039; by a vendor with half the time on the road as myself. You just learn to &quot;Live and Learn&quot;. Got Milk anyone?&nbsp; &nbsp;
