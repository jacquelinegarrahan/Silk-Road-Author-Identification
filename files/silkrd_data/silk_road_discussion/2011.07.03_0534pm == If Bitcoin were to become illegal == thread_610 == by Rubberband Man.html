				It would likely shut down, because it would be extremely hard to find someone to do BTC exchanges.

				Depend what illegal mean to you and where you live. This is internet - global thing and not one country issue.Difficult to control and anyway, digital currency have no potential become illegal. With what grounds? Because its used in purchasing drugs? With that argument they could make $ illegal as well.<br /><br />Digital commodity exist and have a price tag.

				Just because they make something illegal doesn&#039;t mean that it won&#039;t still be used.....case in point....just about everything on SR...

				We don&#039;t care about legal, only functional.&nbsp; If bitcoin remains sound, SR will adjust.&nbsp; Most likely a TOR network exchange will need to open.

				Although that doesn&#039;t really show how it would get shut down, as long as there are countries that don&#039;t (and there will be some) then there will always be exchanges, look at the pirate bay, they still haven&#039;t gotten rid of it, or bittorrent. Besides what legal standing do they have to shut it down?

				Yep: internet, and btc in particular show the future is getting&nbsp; away from statism...and that freaks a lot of people out...but exactly *where* would you make it illegal, and also, try explaining to the public just exactly what it is you are *making* illegal.<br /><br />&quot;Well Mrs. Brown, bitcoins are a bunch of electrons...no, they are, uh....&quot;&nbsp; I think everybody who hasn&#039;t already should start plowing thru &#039;the baroque cycle&#039; by neal stephenson...I was almost through with that huge fucker before I realize *it* was kind of about money: what it is, how it comes about, and who gets to decide it....<br /><br />Eventually, one of us will get cracked, and I&#039;d love to see a serious court case where they try to go up against bitcoins, or even some country tries to make them illegal...this genie&#039;s out of the bottle...freedom is popping out in all kinds of weird ways, just like the fall of the berlin wall, or libyans and iranians hitting the streets...btc is a bit of freedom for drug users...my body, my life...gov&#039;ts need to leave us the fuck alone...
