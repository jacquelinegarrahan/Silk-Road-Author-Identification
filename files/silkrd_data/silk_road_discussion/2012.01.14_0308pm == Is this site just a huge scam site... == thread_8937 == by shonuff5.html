				I can 100000000000% say that the stuff you can buy here is real. Most of it up there with the best you will find because its an open market which you dont really get irl as the chance to compare different products and prices isnt as easy.<br /><br />Like anything, be careful though, there are scammers out there. Read the feedback, read the forums and go with tried and tested vendors. Alternatively, buy small and cheap and help the new vendors get off the ground but at the same time minimizing risk.<br />&nbsp;:)

				Yes, most vendors are legit. It&#039;s up to you to uphold the other end of the deal and keep things secure on your end.

				Yes, &quot;this shit&quot; is legitimate. Do not go out of Escrow and buy from well reputable dealers and you&#039;ll receive a good quality product.

				Definitely not a scam. This is, afaik, the only website that isn&#039;t a scam on the deep web, now that OVDB is down. (I don&#039;t have TFM access.) However, within this website that isn&#039;t a scam, there can be some scammers since essentially anybody can list products if they want to pay for a vendor&#039;s account. Like the other guy said, escrow is your friend, and trusted sellers are your friends. While you can be scammed, it&#039;s hard to be if you are careful.

				Scum do exist in the SR realm, as with everywhere. Spend plenty of time on the forums before ever funding your account. Plenty to learn, some obvious, some not so much. Stick with the very top sellers until you are VERY familiar with the way things work here.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s legit.<br /><br />Tips for not getting scammed, and ensuring your orders make it to your mailbox:<br /><br />1) Don&#039;t rely on vendor feedback alone.&nbsp; Use the forums to research the vendors you plan to use.<br /><br />2) Keep your orders domestic if possible,&nbsp; Having to go through customs greatly increases the odds of your package getting intercepted.<br /><br />3) Use a real address, and a real name associated with that address.<br /><br />4) Be patient.&nbsp; It takes time to acquire bitcoins, and shipping isn&#039;t always as fast as we&#039;d like it, either.&nbsp; Some vendors will require you, as a new buyer to finalize early.&nbsp; Some won&#039;t.&nbsp; Choose your vendors wisely, based on the buzz in the forums.

				Once he goes through the trouble of getting bitcoins and learning PGP, he&#039;ll know this is serious business. <br /><br />And with all the other advice, if he follows it, he&#039;ll be giggling like a school girl when he gets his first order in the mail.
