				To cut the long story short, yesterday I tried crystal meth for the first time and I could say I enjoyed it. It was some dope stuff I suppose because it was a very stimulant and full of life experience.<br />I stopped today at 3 pm while I was still at work. The withdrawal symptoms are clearly visible and from what I understand it might last for 24 hours or so. I am not panicking, however&nbsp; I was planning a LSD trip tomorrow morning. I know that LSD and meth are not a very pleasant experience while they&#039;re hanging around together.<br /><br />So, should I go for a LSD trip after waking up tomorrow? I am planning smoke some weed and go to sleep early tonight to get some rest.<br /><br />This is not my concern, after sobering up from LSD I want to smoke some good DMT freebase I got recently. That would be followed attending a genius party+after for E-heads, so I bought some MDMA which I am thinking to combine with 2C-B. It is possible to also get some speed tomorrow but I should leave it home.<br /><br />So end up with the formula:<br />Meth+LSD+DMT+MDMA+2C-B+speed in less than 48 hours. I&#039;ll probably be sober 5 minutes, +/- 30 seconds in 36 hours.<br /><br />Is this too much?<br /><br />My concern is is that if it goes wrong from phase 1 in my plan (LSD while withdrawing meth) , the whole thing could turn into some weird and intense trip.<br /><br />P.S. I know my drugs individually but I&#039;m not used to combining this many in a relatively short period.

				i&#039;ll never understand stimulants.<br /><br />except for the tiny amount of caffeine in my cup of tea, the appeal is lost on me.<br /><br />to each his own though. best of luck with your combo.

				Not at all; but they will all cancel each other out unless you inject them all into your retinal vein at the same time.. Allowing them to be injested into your stomach means that they react together and cancel each other out like adding an acid to an alkali. Basically just get a friend to put a small teaspoon into your eye socket and squish your eye down enough to get a large 10ml syringe in with a 21g needle. mix all the drugs together in a sterile/ish coke can and add vodka so it all dissolves. use a tampon or dish sponge as a filter and get that shit into the syringe.. Now your friend might need to help with guiding the needle in as obv you cant see into your own head. try get the retinal vein or there about.. any spillage will probably soak straight into your brain anyway so no lost product! let us know how it goes when/if you come down..<br />ACE

They&#039;re going individually somehow, on their own path.
