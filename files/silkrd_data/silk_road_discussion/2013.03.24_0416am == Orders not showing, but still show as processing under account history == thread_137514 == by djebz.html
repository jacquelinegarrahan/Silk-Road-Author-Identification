				Still pretty new to the road, placed my first two orders. Did a search on the forum, it did not seem to answer the question. So on my account on the top it shows orders as 2, when I click it though, they are not shown on the order page anymore. Under account history they are. Is this usually how it is done? Thanks

				Same issue here.&nbsp; I didnt realize it showed under account history, so I was a bit worried.&nbsp; At least it&#039;s still there - hopefully vendors are seeing them ok.&nbsp; You can also see that you will have funds tied up in escrow on your account page due to the order being not being finalized.

				I&#039;ve got 19 orders under the order tab but only 9 of them are showing, coincidentally all the ones that are processing have disappeared. The ones that I have the option to finalize are all showing up however.

				Any vendors able to confirm that they&#039;re receiving new orders?&nbsp; As the problem seems to be only with orders in the processing stage.&nbsp; Would put my mind at ease a bit knowing that they can at least see them.

				Seems SR is a bit wonky atm.<br /><br />clinking on certain vendors listings will take me to a blank page.<br /><br /><br />Also, I second the notion of a Vendor saying they are seeing items to be processed.

				Was just about to make a thread, I too have no orders showing up. Very odd never happened the year I have been here. Hope it gets fixed and more importantly hope the venders can still see my order so it still gets sent out Monday. Worst case they can&#039;t see it and we cant cancel or finalize and get a auto finalize on our stats (hope not).&nbsp;
