				DMT because of the duration and intensity. Almost everything else lasts too long for me.<br /><br />However, I will be trying 2C-B soon and I&#039;m very excited. I have high hopes for this one.

				Without a doubt 2C-B. If you get good stuff then it&#039;s like the best bits of LSD &amp; MDMA put into one drug.

				LSD probably&nbsp; ;D but gad Lucy is such a bitch about tolerance. DMT is fantastic, id love to try ayuausca/pharmayausca though. Waiting for some 25i-NBOMe blotters from DudeRugs (who isn&#039;t?) and ive heard wonderful things so Im hoping to add that to the list

				Ive done some acid before. Was a fun time, cant wait to try it at a higher dosage next time. Hoping to try some legit 2c-b soon, i believe my first experience with it was with a bunk batch.

				25i and Shrooms.&nbsp; I had a failed experiment with 2C-B this week; time for a psych break!&nbsp; 30mgs did hardly anything to me besides some jaw tension and a minor feeling in my sacral chakra.&nbsp; I believe I will change my mind when I finally get my hands on some mescaline, LSD, or DMT.

				DMT no doubt. I still vividly remember the first time I blasted off... something that will stick with your forever. Although some good crystal LSD I had comes in a close 2nd for me.

				oscar, please stop disseminating misinformation. Perhaps that is how 2cb effects you personally, but that is horrible advice for the average person and 2c novice

				For me, it has always been LSD. maybe I just have a special place in my heart because it was the first drug I ever used (other than pot, but who considers pot a drug?) Here lately, though, 4-aco-dmt and 4-aco-det have been great for getting over that mid-week hump. everything else I have tried has it&#039;s positives and negatives. The one that has always interested me, but always been out of my grasp is mescaline. Funny, though because mescaline was one of the first things I bought on SR, but I never took it, because I was sketched out by GIM, so it is still on my bucket list.

It is however a great drug, the biggest plus point is definitely the after effects for weeks afterwards.
