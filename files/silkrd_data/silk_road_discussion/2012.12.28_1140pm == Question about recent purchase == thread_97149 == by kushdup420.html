				I placed an order Sunday since i needed it by Today. He told me he would ship Monday which he didnt. Wednesday comes, still didnt ship, Thusday nothing so i message him and he says he will ship today. Well i&#039;ve messaged him and i know he&#039;s read them and still no reply. My question is, What does the resolve button do? I didnt FE or anything it says Finalize or Resolve. If i resolve do i get my money back? or is there someone i should contact?

				Thankfully you didn&#039;t FE so you have a few options. The resolve button won&#039;t be available for 15 (i think?) days after you place the order and it&#039;s been marked in transit. Both seller and buyer enter into resolution and explain their respective sides, come to a solution if anyone gets money back/paid, or a time extension to let the package get there.<br />If you ordered sunday, the vendor said it&#039;d ship monday, and they didn&#039;t, I&#039;d be rather upset. If they have not sent it, ask them to cancel so that you can order something that will get there by the time you need it. Hate it for that vendor to lose out on a sale, but if they can&#039;t ship when they say they will (provided there wasn&#039;t an emergency situation that came up-like a death or hospital visit), then you should order from someone who can ship on time.<br />What kind of product did you order? Are you willing to say from whom?<br /><br />Don&#039;t finalize. Have the vendor cancel if it&#039;s not been shipped. If it has, wait for it, and if the resolve button comes up in the mean time, hit that shit and ask for a) a time extension, and/or b) a refund of sorts.

				I would resolve and explain the situation to SR. It might take a few days but whatever happens don&#039;t FE. Your money will be safe just tied up for a while. Also whatever the outcome post/warn others on the forum about this behaviour by giving his name. He probably doesnt have the product, he should take his listings down/cancel orders, not waste your time and money.
