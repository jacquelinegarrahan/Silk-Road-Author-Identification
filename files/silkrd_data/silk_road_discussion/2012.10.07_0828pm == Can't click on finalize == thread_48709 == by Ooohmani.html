				It is probably because you purchased it from a new vendor. Until a vendor has completed 35 transactions, their orders cannot be finalized for 2/3 days (not sure which) after the order status is changed to &#039;in transit&#039;.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				It is annoying (and sometimes funny when a customer can&#039;t finalize because the package got there too quickly) but it is there for a reason. 35 transactions isn&#039;t really that much. I&#039;ve been vending for a week and a half (including my samples period) and am about halfway there. It prevents people from opening a new vendor account, requiring FE and then scamming everyone who ordered and then just making a new account etc. You have to put in effort as a (hopefully) solid vendor first.

				grahamgreene, you&#039;re so confrontational and forward. I love it. Haha.. any chance you&#039;re a New Yorker? Since my team moved to Cali, we miss the lovely people of NYC. Our here we have to deal with the endless supply of &#039;actors&#039;. <br /><br />Having to wait for someone to finalize is kind of annoying as new vendor. Because we only deal domestically (in the US), there have been many cases where packages arrive well before customers are allowed to finalize. That being said, 35 transactions isn&#039;t a big deal and waiting 2 days for someone to finalize is a lot better than having these clowns who don&#039;t finalize for 2 weeks even though their package arrived in 2 days. THAT is annoying.<br />.Hades.

				MicroRNA, am I expected as a new seller to put shipments in escrow for buyers with less than 5 feedback? I am not trying to scam, what I am trying to do is safeguard myself from someone ordering a few pills, then claiming that the shipment never arrived or something of that nature. What I don&#039;t understand is that a legit scammer can still wait the 72 hrs, as well as complete 35 transactions and wait a month, possibly taking a loss on their product and then rip a bunch of people off. These &quot;preventative&quot; measures really are interfering with the free flow of goods and services. My customers are being withheld their badly needed products because of some &quot;scammer&quot; somewhere that had nothing to do with either parties wishing to conduct a mutually beneficial transaction. This is a strong barrier to entry that is promoting an environment where the established seller has a strong monopolistic advantage. The other mod even alluded to this as being a good thing!

				i dont support FE period. even as a new buyer i refused to FE, i choose to use vendors that allowed me to stay in escrow<br /><br />the rules are very clear for new vendors unfortunately do to the amount of scams buyers have to deal with. of course this policy does not prevent them from scamming completely but it is a step to help at least. <br /><br />vendors can take their own steps to protect themselves from reverse scams without having to require FE<br /><br />basically your best option is to require new buyers or those with poor stats to pay the additional cost for tracking or delivery confirmation. then, even if they claim they didnt receive the package during resolution you have evidence to prove otherwise<br /><br />alternatively you could have a strict policy upfront that anyone with fewer than a certain number of transactions or a specific refund rate is not entitled to a refund no matter what - if they want to order its at their own risk (i would say unless they use tracking and you can see their order was not delivered) <br /><br />every vendor will have to deal with the occasional buyer saying if you dont do this i will leave bad feedback - and you should tell em to fuck off. if you are legit the positive reviews will speak for themselves because every vendor gets the occasional negative feedback

				As a vendor, DCN is your saving grace. If something goes to resolution with a customer claiming you sent an empty package or whatever...

If you do this, you will lose your selling priviledges. Once you have completed 35 successful transactions and have been a seller for at least one month, you may ask your customers to finalize early without reprocussion. In no way do we support finalizing early in general and this rule should not be construed as support for finalizing early for more established vendors.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m more in disagreement with, well, what technically isn&#039;t a rule but is implemented to prevent breaking a rule.&nbsp; Apparently, I&#039;m a kickass vendor, because with nearly every transaction so far has been an express order, which is sent out within 12 hours, and received ~20 later.&nbsp; So, once I sent a message with a tracking number to a buyer, s/he should be able to click Finalize (since it isn&#039;t Finalizing Early).&nbsp; But I can see the ambiguity possible with that scenario from non-legitimate sellers.&nbsp; Still, after someone receives their order 30 hours after purchasing it, they should be able to leave feedback while the transaction is fresh in their mind.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to PM people days later to remind them that they can finalize now (and I care that they do so I can add another feedback rating to my history so I get less people messaging asking for a free sample or some special scenario because they don&#039;t trust my feedback yet, understandably).<br />And aside from that, the main reason which I guess I&#039;ll have to wait to do, is so I don&#039;t have to hedge my escrow funds.&nbsp; Instead, I can make a judgement call as an investor and save ~4% (or take the risk to be able to) since I know the funds wouldn&#039;t be in escrow more than a dozen or two hours.<br /><br />No buyer worth his volume in nitrogen is going to FE for a new vendor--they&#039;ll only FE for a trusted vendor, and ultimately most vendors probably go out with a bang (where bang = big FE scam).&nbsp; Takes 0 effort for them and effectually allows them to &quot;cash in&quot; on what their reputation is worth.&nbsp; And to everyone saying 35 transactions isn&#039;t a lot, it depends what you&#039;re selling.&nbsp; When every transaction is hundreds of dollars like I&#039;ve been doing, 35 is still a ways away!&nbsp; I&#039;m still 400-800 BTC away at my avg transaction!&nbsp; The system practically encourages new vendors to do things like lottery scams, or real lotteries with $1 tickets.&nbsp; Is that against the rules somewhere where I missed?&nbsp; Can I hold a legitimate lottery with $1 tickets and only 30 tickets sold, with one guaranteed winner of $30?<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll just keep chugging along, confident in knowing that I possibly have the BEST stealth of any vendor, combined with incredible speed and amazing communication, but I don&#039;t get to personally benefit any more than if I were a run-of-the-mill regular ol&#039; slow shipper or vendor that requires FE for every purchase, or the typical &quot;click shipped, then sit on it 5 days before shipping&quot;.&nbsp; THAT shouldn&#039;t be allowed, e.g. no one can click finalize for 36 hours.&nbsp; But seriously, what about the $30 lottery?

				I suppose all I can do is restate the fact that bitching about something that everyone has to follow is pretty pointless. Also, careful about your claim to the best stealth here... our customers, we&#039;re certain, would beg to differ.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I jest somewhat, but yea... rules are rules. lol<br /><br />.Hades.
