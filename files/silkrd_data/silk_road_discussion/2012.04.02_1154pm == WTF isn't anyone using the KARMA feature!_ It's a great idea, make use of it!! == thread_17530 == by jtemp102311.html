				I think this karma, and reputation numbers for forums is a bullshit concept in general. I hate those forums that will ban you if your rep gets too low, because if you&#039;re a new user, if you don&#039;t kiss all the other veteran user&#039;s butts you will get ganged up on and banned for sure.<br /><br />But fuck somebody else being able to click a button to say whether they like your opinion or not. Many really good and insightful opinions are unpopular at first.

				Sure, Karma can be used as a decent judge of a user&#039;s character, but not if we go around &quot;fingering karma left and right&quot;. If I see a user with +1/-9, I can usually guess that if I looked in their post history, I&#039;d see some thread where they probably acted inappropriately. If we use it sparingly, those numbers can give us some idea of the particularly nasty people and the especially good ones.

				I give it out, but only for actual helpful posts. People use it to suck the dick of or hurt the reputation of someone they either agree with or disagree with, respectively. Until there is a &quot;see which posts got karma&quot; function, it&#039;s pretty worthless because of how people use it. For it to be worthwhile it&#039;s imperative that we be able to see the posts that were given both positive and negative karma.

People with high karma seem to say the most intelligent and useful things, whereas people with low karma seem to post all over the place, often needlessly or stupidly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Or negatively.<br /><br />I noticed that the people with a high negative karma rating, who also have (some but) low positive karma, often either post all over the place (as you said) or post exclusively negative comments. While their comments might sometimes be helpful or true, because they are clearly intelligent, the fact that the content is 99.9% negative, is what gets them the neg karma. People get sick of others who never have anything nice to say. And I agree that that should be &quot;discouraged.&quot;<br /><br />Usually I find that the people who have relatively high positive and moderate negative tend to be those who are generally helpful and intelligent, but who are also opinionated. Many people don&#039;t like opinions, especially when they make their own look pointless. And they use the karma system to &quot;retaliate&quot; while flying under the radar, and take advantage of not having to be held accountable for that action.<br /><br />People who have generally high karma and next to no negative karma tend to be the &quot;nice&quot; types who don&#039;t post opinions at all. The nurturing types, if you will. Although I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s the right word.<br /><br />There is one person who posted in this discussion, dissing the karma system, who I actually ran across on another thread being kind of an elitist douche. I look at his profile to read his comments, lo and behold -- all of his comments are elitist douche comments. Not a single comment has so much as an agreement in it. He has a couple of +karma, and plenty of -karma.<br /><br />I for one agree with themessenger. I think the karma system is way too limited and almost useless until we have a feature where we can see which posts have a karma rating. Until then, people will use it as a means to ruin peoples reputations or brown nose.

You&#039;re damn lucky I can&#039;t spank your childish asses! Forums are there for<br />EVERYONE! Not just your sorry asses! You&#039;re all &#039;senior members&#039; and set a horrible example for buyers and<br />are a disgrace to Silk Road!<br /><br />And then you little dicked assholes are armed with what I call the &quot;-/karma gun&quot; to act like childish cyber<br />bully&#039;s by attacking anyone you don&#039;t like what they post and provide them with &#039;-/karma&#039; point.Who gives a<br />fuck? Trying to compensate for tiny penis syndrome or what? We don&#039;t even go to forums any more because of<br />little fuck bitches like you! You are the only fucked up thing about Silk Road! Ass holes. Same goes for you<br />little prick vendors that cancel orders because we won&#039;t FE. And I&#039;m not talking about large orders, I&#039;m<br />talking about 5 and 10 bitcoin items! Bull shit on you! We&#039;d rather never do dope again than buy from your<br />stupid asses! And you know WHO you are too! Probably the same bitch punks in forums handing out -/karma like it means ANYTHING!<br /><br />Mom sez after that I have to include this; WE LOVE YOU ALL! And I do love you guys! I just want you to stop<br />acting like punk ass bitch bully&#039;s. You&#039;re embarrassing!<br /><br />Lol &quot;&#039;<br /><br />I posted this here because it mentioned &#039;karma&#039; - a stupid self serving idea for sure. Oh yeah, anyone who doesn&#039;t like what I say and can&#039;t wait for me to check back in - which may be NEVER - just PM me/us. Positive or negative. Because forums are for anyone/everyone to say what ever they wish. NOT JUST WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR! <br /><br />We welcome negative input. We learn something from every person that ever says anything to us, from a child&#039;s words to the punk ass bitches that think their little -/karma&#039;s mean ANY THING! Get us kicked out if you can! <br /><br />Punks!<br /><br />Okay, Mom sez I have to tell you ALL that I do love you again. I do, you just piss me off when you do that controlling bullshit!<br /><br />Have a great day y&#039;all!<br /><br />Dad

People able to give karma are the ones posting everywhere they can and can&#039;t or open useless threads like this one.<br />People with &quot;higher karma&quot; are just asslickers of the ones above.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>However I don&#039;t agree with this. Not that I would give negative karma for it though.<br />People who have karma are not necessarily posting everywhere. They might just post frequently in the same thread. I have 17 karma points (good and bad) several of the bad was form a dedicated troll who decided to wait three days to give me as much neg karma as possible, but that&#039;s beside the point. I don&#039;t post in a lot of different threads. However, I am very active in one very popular thread. It a thread that moves about 5-12 pages a day, so it warrants making more than one post every few days. Karma, on these forums, is just what happens when you&#039;re active in a community.

				I think this karma thing is stupid! A troll can give you negative karma just for kicks. Personally as a vendor I just let my SR page speak for it self not what some troll might want to give out or because someone disagrees with you. Honestly I could careless if people give me negative karma because like I said my vendor page is where the real feed back is from actual buyers

I guess I need 100 posts :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; I haven&#039;t reached the point where I can give karma, but on other forums I always try to give positive feedback when someone seems like a positive person, or just needs to know that someone cares enough to read their post. Somehow all I have managed to get here is negative karma, and it kind of makes me laugh because I know some people enjoy the reaction it gets, but if you are getting bad karma for a good reason, it would be nice to have someone say what you are doing to piss people off so you have a chance to do it more, I mean change the way you post.&nbsp; But like I said, I think it&#039;s just a game and some people play if dif than others. I am expecting some more bad karma for this, maybe even a 420 special on bad karma points. Lol. (only thing about the karma thing that bothers me is when it is given to some dealers maybe just to make them look bad)

				I don&#039;t like it. Basically post count means nothing. A better idea would be the ability to link your buyer and seller account to your forum username and people could see your feedback.
