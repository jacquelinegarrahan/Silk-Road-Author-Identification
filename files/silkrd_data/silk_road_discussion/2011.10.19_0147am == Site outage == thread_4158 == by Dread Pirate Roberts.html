				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />We are terribly sorry for the sudden outage today. We will be back up as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />We are having to rebuild the site from a backup. All Bitcoins in user accounts and the escrow are accounted for and all site data has been saved except for roughly the last 30 minutes of activity preceding the outage. Any messages you sent or activity you engaged in during that window will have to be re-done except for deposits and withdrawals. Also, all of the pictures were not backed up, so sellers will need to re-upload them.<br /><br />There was no security breach or anything to worry about that lead to this situation. We lease server space in different locations around the globe through unaware 3rd parties. We do this to hide the identities of those that run Silk Road in the event of a security breach in one of the servers. Unfortunately, this means we have to deal with some unreliable people who, without revealing too much detail, didn&#039;t keep their promises and lead to our servers being shutdown<br /><br />It is taking so long to get back online because we have to re-download the Bitcoin block-chain through Tor. My hope is that we can get back up by 2 am EST. If we aren&#039;t back up by then, I&#039;ll recalibrate my estimate and post it here.<br /><br />Also, the forum is down for completely unrelated reasons and we are working on that too.<br /><br />Thanks again for your understanding.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJOnhwMAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olmhsIALGppUm3hOxtEuKEekJ43IBz<br />TDBKk89LDT35sVM1bPG/pq+d+F3RxcPC1JubQ70/LVsqeOxlM4Q5nISzcwHQfvFF<br />EI9sPpNJZG7rB1NmD+BKCUrx77GCKjuejVc28P7O6j8Fc+xYCb4poBeW3TlOeNm5<br />mF5YEhqLr25p8V0hVMUhEAiGNYr03L2eJnteR1HknmCWeDAlPNvgaY1E9DPypKQ9<br />uEWGf7DTzR6hJMKcblLtt18OOwMJY123TNwjurVz702u6nHsZqbg89krs1xVEL1l<br />jU2+oePbD3w/z3C2AgoXNSDw/sX8pMFquCT+7CNmUDPX9nzCkYMRwq2ZaFqnai8=<br />=J3SG<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; 2am EST has come and gone.&nbsp; I&#039;m still running test to make sure everything is working as it should on the new forum.&nbsp; I forgot how complicated this site is!&nbsp; My new estimate is 4am EST.<br /><br />...and we&#039;re back!&nbsp; I&#039;ll be checking messages for the next hour or so, so if anything is amiss with the restored site please message me asap.&nbsp; Thanks for hanging in there.&nbsp; We&#039;ll keep doing our best to make sure this kind of thing never happens again.<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; Looks like I spoke too soon.&nbsp; The site is down once more, most likely due to an overload of traffic from everyone getting back on the site and sellers uploading their pics all at once.&nbsp; I will update you here as soon as I know more.<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; I just opened the site back up.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a reprint of the announcement:<br /><br />We have been experiencing technical difficulties over the past couple of days. This is nothing to be overly concerned about. We will be back to normal soon. We are opening the site back up again but this time with image uploading disabled. Hopefully our backup server can handle the traffic this time, but if it goes down again, we will stay down until we can get a more powerful server online. Click here for more details.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Please do not use past addresses for future deposits. Only use the bold address on your account page. We have not gotten to the bottom of it yet, but it is possible that we lost some of the old addresses during the switch to the backup server.<br /><br />One other thing, we are not auto-finalizing orders or moderating past-due resolutions for at least a couple of days so everyone can catch up from not having access to the site.Thanks again for everyone&#039;s patience through all of this. We&#039;ve received far more encouragement than complaints these past couple of days, so thank you for standing behind the site :)<br /><br />UPDATE: Ok, looks like we&#039;re down again.&nbsp; I was pretty hopeful it would work that time, oh well.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been working on a full capacity backup all along anyway, so we should have that up soon, possibly within 12 hours though I&#039;ll post something more concrete when I know.&nbsp; Hang in there gang, there&#039;s a light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; Also, for everyone concerned about missing bitcoin deposits, do not worry.&nbsp; We will get it sorted out and your account will be credited one way or another.&nbsp; Sorry for the stress :)<br /><br />UPDATE 1AM UTC:&nbsp; Nothing much else to add to the update.&nbsp; Just want to reassure everyone that we are doing everything in our power to get the site back up.&nbsp; We are pursuing two separate paths in parallel and whichever is finished first is when we&#039;ll be back up.&nbsp; Hard to say when that will be, I&#039;ll update as soon as I know more.<br /><br />UPDATE 8AM UTC 10/21/2011:&nbsp; The light at the end of the tunnel is getting bigger!&nbsp; We have a full capacity server online and are in the process of configuring it.&nbsp; Two other independent, full capacity servers are in the pipeline to serve as backups, so if we ever have an unexpected outage again we won&#039;t be scrambling to find a server that can handle the traffic.&nbsp; I am so incredibly sorry this happened.&nbsp; Thank you for hanging in there and being so understanding :)<br /><br />UPDATE 1:00PM UTC 10/21/2011:&nbsp; We are sooooo close to going live again.&nbsp; And I am sooooo exhausted :)&nbsp; We&#039;re still doing the final tests and configurations, but I&#039;m going to want to get a little sleep before we go live, so once we are ready to go, I am going to get a few hours of sleep, then wake up and launch so I will have the energy to oversee how it&#039;s going and respond to everyone&#039;s messages that I&#039;m sure will come flooding in.&nbsp; See you soon :)<br /><br />UPDATE 9:18PM UTC 10/21/2011:&nbsp; Got some rest.&nbsp; We are working out some bugs in the new setup, gotta be thorough.&nbsp; We should be able to go live sometime in the next 12 hours.<br /><br />UPDATE 1:18AM UTC 10/22/2011:&nbsp; What an ordeal!&nbsp; The site just went live.&nbsp; The new server is more powerful and secure than the one we were on before the outage and is leased through a much more professional proxy, so I have high hopes that it will last us a long time.&nbsp; We&#039;ve amped up our backup plans none the less and will have multiple independent full-capacity servers waiting in the wings at all times.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to speak too soon, though.&nbsp; This is a new system and if something goes wrong, we may have to take the site down again, but like I said things are looking much better now.&nbsp; Again, I am honored by everyone&#039;s support and patience this week.&nbsp; I love you all :D<br /><br />UPDATE 4:00AM UTC 10/22/2011:&nbsp; You may have noticed the site being down for a minute or two every 15 min or so over the past couple of hours.&nbsp; We figured out the problem was our system running into an arbitrary limit in the configuration.&nbsp; We increased the limit and should be running more smoothly now.

				It&#039;s not that the forum was rolled back - over the last few days the other forum, version 2.0, was active, now 2.0.1 is active. Since 2.0.1 wasn&#039;t active for the last few days no posts have been placed on it. All posts from the last few days are on the other forum. RI, if you changed your password in the last few days you only changed it on the other forum not on this one. If anyone created a user on the forums before the databases diverged your user will be on both. If you created it afterwards it will only be on one or the other. Same goes for posts. This is what all the evidence shows. <br /><br />Why are there are two forums that alternate? 42.

				^ Word! People take webservers etc for granted until they go down. No one appreciates the server admins that make the world go round. Many times people only see an admin&#039;s work when there is a problem. I know how it is SR and while I hope it is up sooner rather than later, I know that these things take time to be sorted out correctly.

				I was able to log on late last night and everything with my account looked perfect! I feared that the site would go down again due to sheer volume of traffic, which is probably what is happening now. Great job SR and nice to see some PGP signed communication about the state of the forums and the site.<br /><br />Keep up the good work SR and lets all keep our fingers crossed for a good outcome.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Not to spread FUD or be distrustful, but I never had and occasion to import SR&#039;s official public key, so I can&#039;t check his sig. I&#039;m sure I was not the first to think of this and I&#039;m sure multiple people have confirmed that the signed messages are coming from the man himself. If this is not the way it works than please forgive my ignorance.<br /><br />Thanks and I wish I could say I&#039;m praying for you SR, but I am an atheist and that would be hypocritical. Anyhow, best of luck, no matter how this turns out.

				If im not mistaken much like mybitcoin when it goes down if a transaction takes place during the outages I know mbc has no way of actually &quot;seeing&quot; that transfer from say from a pool to mbc i would presume it would be the same for mtgox to SR I wouldn&#039;t worrie to much about it thou those guys that are missing there btc hey I COMPLETELY understand how frustrating this is right now I get that but relax guys as much of a inconvenience it is your a unfortunate victim of circumstance and at this time I assume silkroads priority is to resume normal operations first as many of you don&#039;t know what it takes to actually maintain a site like this it is incredible it is back up this quickly and of course when dealing with peoples money frustrating as fuck because I&#039;m sure his inbox is fucking maxed right now <br /><br />there is a reason why i never keep a balance of more then 50btc on SR and it is because of things like this im sure each case will be evaluated and dealt with but it will take a shit ton of time just to get things settled down :)<br /><br /><br />On a side note SR admin I have a bunch of space on a unmetered fractional OC3 connection located at terra-byte being that my mate is staff security is not a issue I could possibly offer you a jail if you need if so message me on SR itself <br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/13555

				Yes, was back up&nbsp; for a while then went down again around an hour or so ago. My guess it that SR took it down to investigate the missing transfers and have the site&#039;s bitcoind or whatever rescan the block chain, so be prepared for it to be down again for at least a few more hours. Just my guess though. Might just be overloaded from everybody trying to log in at once.

If you don&#039;t like hearing the community talk about the outage direct your attention elsewhere i suppose. People are gonna talk about things that may be a little off topic, that&#039;s just part of a forum, but you&#039;re still gonna get the updates you crave as they happen.

				I am happy none of this happened when I was handing out all the samples. I actually am also glad it was up long enough on Tuesday to grab the one order I had and ship it out :P<br /><br />As for the Black market website, I know its like loyalties being divided for some people, but its just another place for people to branch out to. SR took my money for a sellers account here, so I don&#039;t feel massive loyalties to just having my stock up for sale with just them. In fact I was on other sites before SR. It may have been a bit tacky though to through the link here at the moment though.<br /><br />I am sure SR will be back up and running in no time and I agree with other posters that I would prefer for them to take their time. If they are going to do it, they will want to make sure they do it right. I have no idea the logistics required to running a site like this and I am grateful its even up. Ty SR and hope you work out the kinks.

				Jesus H - settle the fuck down everybody. I know some of you are probably tweaking about funds just chill - there is no reason to believe that SR will not make things right. Additionally, systems such as this are by nature some what risky - you should keep that in mind when you make financial decisions. Also a big fuck you to the blackmarket asshat - making an account to make one post, advertising your site on a thread which is about the operational status of another site is greasier than a greek bathhouse attendants arsed sphincter. If individual vendors want to provide their customers with a different place to reach them fine - but to pimp your site like you did is most shameful. Give SR admin some more time - huff some paint if you need to - just relax and remember, the more time he spends writing updates to reassure us that he is working on it the less time he spends fixing the problem.&nbsp;

				On Black Market: I went there when they first got rolling, last time SR was down, and I have to say I got ripped off twice.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t major, best I can remember, but they didn&#039;t have escrow, and the scammers were using names from SR, and selling similar product.&nbsp; I went from there over to OLDB, and found what I was looking for.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did find the owner of BM over on the bitcoin forums, and he was friendly and honest about it.&nbsp; Made me appreciate escrow a whole lot, when SR finally came back up..and I think since then, BM has gotten escrow in.

				I had a thought earlier, to avoid something like what happened with the second crash due to so many users sitting there ctrl+f5&#039;ing every five minutes til they saw it up, then flooding the server right as it got back up and running.<br /><br />So, the idea goes a little like this, SR starts up but doesn&#039;t tell ANYONE but sellers. That way all the sellers can get on, the server won&#039;t be overrun, and they can get their pics and listings back up, check their messages etc. Then, the sellers can message SR and let them know who has pending transactions. Then all the sellers can log off, the buyers who still need to finalize orders and such can then be told that the sights up and they get on finalize, etc. Then tell those with BTC stuck on SR so they can place orders, rinse, wash repeat.<br /><br />All the while they can still be on the lookout for more server space to accommodate the large number of members, and work out the kinks and bugs that may be left in the backup of the site. After its all up and running with all the server space required, and everything working, THEN make a &quot;public&quot; announcement, and hope that the server doesn&#039;t flood.<br /><br />Of course this is a moot point if its more than just a server space problem, but I thought it was a good idea, I&#039;ve take 2 clonapins tho, so it may be an awful idea.

That way all the sellers can get on, the server won&#039;t be overrun, and they can get their pics and listings back up, check their messages etc. Then, the sellers can message SR and let them know who has pending transactions. Then all the sellers can log off, the buyers who still need to finalize orders and such can then be told that the sights up and they get on finalize, etc. Then tell those with BTC stuck on SR so they can place orders, rinse, wash repeat.<br /><br />All the while they can still be on the lookout for more server space to accommodate the large number of members, and work out the kinks and bugs that may be left in the backup of the site. After its all up and running with all the server space required, and everything working, THEN make a &quot;public&quot; announcement, and hope that the server doesn&#039;t flood.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Amazing what F5 can do. The only thing I find a bit problematic, is getting people on accordingly. Sounds like a great idea; limiting the log on procedure to sellers only, and then the buyers. Hopefully there isn&#039;t any outstanding transactions that can&#039;t be fixed. And with the server space, and function, finding an offshore server is imo, difficult and scary. As you may not have total control on it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, I agree. Basically we&#039;d need a new thread where all of us who had to star new accounts on the forums, and who have pending/in transit transaction, post their SR usernames(if you can get on your original account here then your one of the lucky few) so that SR would know who to contact after the sellers get everything back to normal. And if we could be patient and keep cycling our allotted time, and get on only long enough to do what we need and get off, then report to SR when we get off we could still use SR and give the admins the time they need to find server space without having to resort to risky offshore servers. IDK, just my 0.02BTC ;)

I, for one, can wait as long as it takes and I know many on here feel the same.<br /><br />My heart goes out to everyone that&#039;s been tirelessly working on this, As soon as I get some more BTC I&#039;m for sure gonna donate to keep this wheel in the sky a-turnin&#039;

				Any status reports SR ? I appreciate your work but curious as to what stage of progress your In you keep saying your hammering out the issues working on stuff making sure it was bug free makes me wonder if there is a bigger problem ? <br /><br />perhaps I&#039;m just wigging like the rest but i mean and i don&#039;t know the details of the site but if im not mistaken pretty much most of SR is just sql data *most of* if it just needs to be restored whats the issue&nbsp; since pictures are already gone it must honestly just be php and sql data and since there is just a master wallet or wallets and all the site does is move a transparent number around from one user to another till they want to withdraw ...<br /><br />im just confused at what the issue is i do appreciate you giving us more feedback then the mtgox staff did when they had there issue but it would be nice to have a bit more period updates :)<br /><br />cheers and hope your back online again shortly <br /><br />

				SR, thanks for all the hard work.&nbsp; I know how much effort it takes to keep a website like this alive.&nbsp; Idk what kind of tools or your level of administration sophistication you are using to keep things going in the backend, so I hope I am not preaching to the choir, but if you don&#039;t already do it, I think mysql replication over an SSH connection over tor would be pretty awesome and not hard to set up (I assume you are using mysql).&nbsp; Keep a binary log on each slave that logs slave updates, use automysqlbackup nightly (stop and start the slave when you do that) and you will always have up to the second backups even if an evil person starts destroying data or takes the master server offline.&nbsp; Just my two cents.&nbsp; Keep up the excellent work!

				I think everyone will have to be patient while the site admins thread through the bock chains and put people&#039;s deposits where they belong, and make any shopping cart transactions that got stuck in the midst of an DB transaction. They can do it. Mighrt take a day or two.

				I realize that buyers and sellers have different agendas, but I, for one, am going to log out of SR and come back tomorrow some time, and let the DB breathe. Maybe if a few hundred buyers just lay off fro while, if nothing is urgent, it might make the database tuning and other tech shit easier for the admins&nbsp; and engineers while they tune the local network, firewall, TOR proxy settings, and database settings.

				Would take around an hour or so, in your bitcoin wallet you should see the transactions and the number of &quot;confirmations&quot;, you need 6 confirmations I think for the transaction to clear. Just wait it out. To transfer funds to SR just go to your account and send the bitcoins to the address in your profile. You&#039;ll have to wait another hour or so for this. Hope this helps

				&quot;I dont wanna know nuthin except when my BTC are gonna show up!!!!<br /><br />I get it, I do, we all do. This is a new type of exchange medium, the Bitcoin, and was designed so that a central authority is not needed to clear transactions. It&#039;s a peer to peer technology that uses a stream of transaction blocks that can be inspected (by people and the wallet software) so that transactions that are not acknowledged can be completed.&nbsp; It would not hurt, if you are going to be using bitcoins, to watch the bitcoin.org video or read up a little on the transfer mechanism. <br /><br />It takes a finite amount of time to do a regular transfer when both the sending and receiving systems are operational, and it may take longer when a systems is down, and a little longer still for stalled transactions to be fixed by a system that keeps the wallet for you, such as SR. <br /><br />Bitcoins are designed not go missing, technically. SR just came off of a serious outage, so give them a message and some reasonable time to get the transactions sorted. Trust in the block chain.&nbsp; <br />

				Yep, it&#039;s all working for me...and it might be overkill, but I think it&#039;s good to have a backup username here and on main site, stashed w/password, so if things get weird, and you can&#039;t get in regular accnt, u can try the other...

				My BTC transfers to SR yesterday never showed up, but my transfers from today with a newer SR addy did, so it is obviously not just a blockchain download issue, FWIW. Still, I know Silk Road will get to my message detailing the missing transaction and credit my account. I&#039;ll just have to wait a bit more before I get my drugs :P
