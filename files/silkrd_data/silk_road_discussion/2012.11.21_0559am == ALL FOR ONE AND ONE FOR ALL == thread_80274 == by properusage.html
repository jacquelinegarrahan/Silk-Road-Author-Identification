				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My encounters with SR began about 6 months ago, that being said, i have attached myself to one vendor that fit my specific need. My forum account gives me little to none when it comes to credibility however this topic is not invasive when it comes to personal accountability. I think silk road, in this time and place; needs to tighten its circle. Those of us who have joined and conducted our business as we have, subject our selves to danger by conducting our selves as normal. I simply do not want to see any of us be shut down or have our business compromised. Us as a community have already gained an unwanted amount of attention. This attention, in my opinion, will bring a wave of new attention by an age range from children not knowing what they are encountering to veteran street dealers/ buyers who are overwhelmed by what we offer. I suggest we not get greedy, the community we have built is an accomplishment in its entirety. We have a wide variety of vendor and buyers for all classifications of illegals. Not saying new vendors / buyers shouldn&#039;t be welcome but i say we step our screening process up. It&#039;s only a matter of time before the deepweb is no different then clearnet and i morn the day i see any of my brothers or sisters fall victim of our wonderful government. WE are the UNDERGROUND&nbsp; SR has had its glory and. at this point, made too much of a public name for it&#039;s self. That is simply my opinion and that being i said, i am no tech savy but i rely on the things i do here to take care of my family in real life and the day i see something public regarding legal trouble directly linked to SR is a sad sad day, all of this being said , im hammered meaning drunk as balls, i wish everyone safe travels

				your so right, we need to keep it tight and keep it right. too many people up to no good, trying to take advantage of a system like no other. too bad there is financial incentive for DPR to keep the volume of sales running high, so we may not be able to realistically close of the community.

				DPR obviously had an incentive with money however i don&#039;t see him being greedy his money is made the uncharted amount he has made/ could make is not worth his entire community being compromised i vote we all back in to an encrypted corner

				Maybe, it&#039;s hard to say. There&#039;s a good system already in place here.
