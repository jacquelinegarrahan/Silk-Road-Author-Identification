				Very Mature...It&#039;s my duty to make the SR community aware that something isn&#039;t right with you and your games.<br /><br />You opened a big can of worms.<br /><br />Now I get to report you as a vendor and send SR Support our conversation along w/ claims on the forums that you have stolen money from other customers. <br /><br />Now, we both know that, the conversation goes on longer...but here&#039;s a taste. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98656.msg706027#msg706027">Quote from: biologicalmadman on January 06, 2013, 01:51 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98656.msg705835#msg705835">Quote from: AnonymousAddict on January 05, 2013, 11:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I CANT WIN ANYTHING FOR THE LIFE OF ME!!

First of all....I tried like 7 times on different ones and never one or got close. But when they first started out, they had the roulette game for 0.99 cents where 1 in 250 wins 10 BTC instantly and I won...So I thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;(The following below is one of many messages I sent them after I PMed saying &quot;Thanks so much!! I can&#039;t believe I won, you guys are awesome!&quot;<br />- A response after they responded to my win with &quot;Sorry mate. The listing is quite clear, the LAST two digits have to be 99. Close though :)&quot;<br /><br />I respond: <br />&quot;The listing isn&#039;t quite clear then; it states&quot;<br /><br />&quot;SR&#039;s Gaming Commission Real Roulette<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Double 9s Pay 10BTC* <br />Immediate Results. Immediate Payouts.&quot;<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />It mentions that also, &quot;2.) If that last two digits of the transaction id are 99 then you win 10 BTC.&quot; So I realize that part does not match my transaction; but in actuality, it does say &quot;Double 9s Pay 10BTC&quot;. So I suggest you take that portion out and not have it on the post at all or make it MORE CLEAR because I don&#039;t feel that it&#039;s a fair deal now for me seeing as my Transaction #9bbce7❰99❱a6 - therefore I have &quot;Double 9s and should be paid 10 BTC.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to make a whole ordeal about this, but I need to stress the fact that my impression (and most likely others) when they read it..is if you have Double 9s anywhere you get BTC, and also Double 9s at the end you get 10 BTC, based on that second sentence of the listing. I&#039;m confident that you will clear up any errors in both the post within the listing as well as take the proper measures regarding my particular outcome.<br /><br />SR Gaming Commission: &quot;Apologies for the misunderstanding. I see what you mean. I&#039;ll edit the listing to make it more clear. -lee&quot; <br /><br />*He didn&#039;t say thank you or anything after I had to make it clear to him that if I hadn&#039;t pointed that out or noticed it, and come 2 weeks down the road someone comes across it...he&#039;s lucky that it was someone (such as myself) who could possible cause chaos as well as a a domino effect of a all the others who may had &quot;won&quot; and demanded money because of HIS ERROR (which he clearly acknowledged he screwed up) Ya..he screwed up, and now he&#039;s screwing me over. GRRR....anyway, ya they are sketchy and this &quot;Lee&quot; guy is an arrogant, pompous ass. He offered me a 0.99 cent refund and proof he changed the post more clearly in CAPS. Thanks man...how generous of you after I saved your ass. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />

So I suggest you take that portion out and not have it on the post at all or make it MORE CLEAR because I don&#039;t feel that it&#039;s a fair deal now for me seeing as my Transaction #9bbce7❰99❱a6 - therefore I have &quot;Double 9s and should be paid 10 BTC.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to make a whole ordeal about this, but I need to stress the fact that my impression (and most likely others) when they read it..is if you have Double 9s anywhere you get BTC, and also Double 9s at the end you get 10 BTC, based on that second sentence of the listing. I&#039;m confident that you will clear up any errors in both the post within the listing as well as take the proper measures regarding my particular outcome.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bio<br /><br />____<br />SR Gaming Commission(98)<br />Apologies for the misunderstanding. I see what you mean. I&#039;ll edit the listing to make it more clear.<br /><br />lee<br /><br />____<br />BioFog07 <br />Lee,<br /><br />I can&#039;t help but feel somewhat bewildered that after I was under the impression that I won the lottery because of an error in your posting, that I am not receiving any revocation for that? The fact that you are editing the post goes to show that you understand you made a mistake; a mistake which could have caused a huge uproar if it had gone unnoticed for a long time and a customer, such as myself, finally noticed. I urge you to really think about this situation and how someone else may have pointed it out after feeling as they have won, was told they didn&#039;t, and he immediately went to the forums causing many many past customers demanding money. Let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience...<br /><br />-Bio<br /><br />____<br />SR Gaming Commission(98)<br />BioFog, the listing clearly said &quot;2.) If the last two digits of the transaction id are 99 then you win 10 BTC.&quot; That is wholly unambiguous.<br /><br />The change I made was altering LAST TWO DIGITS into all caps and adding &quot;ANY DRAW ENDING IN&quot; before &quot;double 9s pays 10BTC&quot; to prevent someone who did not read past the tag line from misunderstanding.<br /><br />The odds would not be 1 in 255 if double 9s were acceptable at any position. The odds would be approximately 9 in 255, or 1 in 28.<br /><br />If you&#039;re trying to argue that you won the jackpot, I apologize again, but that&#039;s not the case.<br /><br />I will however refund your ticket price to your SR account. We are not trying to deceive anyone. I will go over our other listings to make sure all our games are explained as clearly as possible.<br /><br />best<br />lee<br /><br />____<br />BioFog07 <br />I appreciate the offer of 0.99 cents back but go ahead and keep it. You really put the cart before the horse here but don&#039;t forget that forewarned is forearmed and I simply stated the facts that your lottery post was written in error at the beginning as you clearly said &quot;Double 9s wins 10 BTC&quot;. Now you won&#039;t have this issue with anyone else so best of luck to you and your lottery services. I am sorry to say your statistics are &quot;wholly ambigious&quot; as it does not pertain to two 9s adjacent to one another but quite frankly that clearly does not matter. Best of luck..<br />

				Honestly, I don&#039;t need to waste my time further with you. I simply am wanting to keep the SR community and my fellow vendors/customers safe and scam free. I do not believe that you are practicing such qualities. Thank you for posting the whole conversation as it elaborates the truth behind the situation...I am clearly the bigger man by not going public first as well as not trying to extort you in anyway. I didn&#039;t hound you for the 10 BTC even though you admitted to posting the listing in error which technically, would make me a winner. I understood, you made a mistake, so I moved on. When I started hearing that others are feeling as you have scammed them, that&#039;s why I gave you poor feedback. It&#039;s evident that it hurt your ego more than your stats based on how you are handling this...I apologize in advance if I don&#039;t stay up to date with your thread as I feel no need to stay connected to you or your &quot;business&quot;.

First of all....I tried like 7 times on different ones and never one or got close. But when they first started out, they had the roulette game for 0.99 cents where 1 in 250 wins 10 BTC instantly and I won...So I thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;(The following below is one of many messages I sent them after I PMed saying &quot;Thanks so much!! I can&#039;t believe I won, you guys are awesome!&quot;<br />- A response after they responded to my win with &quot;Sorry mate. The listing is quite clear, the LAST two digits have to be 99. Close though :)&quot;<br /><br />I respond: <br />&quot;The listing isn&#039;t quite clear then; it states&quot;<br /><br />&quot;SR&#039;s Gaming Commission Real Roulette<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Double 9s Pay 10BTC* <br />Immediate Results.

GRRR....anyway, ya they are sketchy and this &quot;Lee&quot; guy is an arrogant, pompous ass. He offered me a 0.99 cent refund and proof he changed the post more clearly in CAPS.

You didnt understand the rules before you threw away your money and that alone says something about your thought process.
