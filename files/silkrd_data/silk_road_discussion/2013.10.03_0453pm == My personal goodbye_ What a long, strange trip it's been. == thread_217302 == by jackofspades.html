				&#039;What a long, strange trip it&#039;s been.&#039;<br />-Grateful Dead<br /><br />I have love in my heart for all of my fellow members.<br />This is not a &#039;good bye&#039; per se, but an &#039;until we meet again&#039;.<br /><br />In the coming weeks and and months, a lot of misinformation and disinformation will be spread.<br />Let us all remember to TRUST NO ONE. Do our own independent research and be smart. <br /><br />The feds think this was a victory but they cannot stop progress. Other Marketplaces are already open and thriving <br />more are sure to come, and this time the owners/operators will have even more knowledge and better equipped security teams to combat LE.<br />The downfall of SR will only make us stronger in the long run. This event has gained media attention on major news networks and websites. Thousands will now be investing in BTC and logging on to new marketplaces (some of which still haven&#039;t launched).<br /><br />SHEEP MARKETPLACE-http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/manager/login<br />Forums-http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/forum/category/general-and-news<br />BLACK MARKET RELOADED-5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion<br /><br />I encourage this community to stick together above all else. We were not loyal to drugs, or crime, or money, or a website. No.<br />We are loyal to an idea. <br />Freedom. <br />Freedom is what brought us here (to SR) and freedom is what will keep us on the deepweb. <br /><br />These are trying times, yes, but impossible is nothing and we will all learn and become stronger. We will emerge better off than before and the feds will need twice as much money and manpower spent to take down the next anon marketplace. <br /><br />LE may indeed charge fellow members, myself included, but i take solace in the fact that the ideologies i share with many, will live on. They can and may put me in a cell for the remainder of my life. I will not lie, im scared and im scared for those who do go down (including Ross). But future generations will continue to fight and eventually win the War on Drugs. <br /><br />Some of my best friends are here, this is goodbye fellow members, but not for long, we may meet again, it may be under different aliases in different forums or it may not be until judgement day.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have all chose this life, and it doesn&#039;t come with second chances. Please be careful. Encourage others and work together. <br />The most important thing is organization, I implore those who remain to GET ORGANIZED. <br /><br />GET FUCKING ORGANIZED. Seriously we can&#039;t always be running and hiding from everyone if we intend to win this war. We need an attack strategy and we need to protect those who protect us. It may be the biggest hippie cliche` ever but &#039;Fight the Power&#039; fight it until revolutionary change occurs. <br /><br />You all came for the drugs, and now its time for the REVOLUTION!<br /><br />R.I.P. SR 10.02.2013<br /><br />A special mention to those who really impacted me and made this community a great place to spend my time:<br /><br />Scout<br />Cirrus<br />Libertas<br />SSBD<br />Inigo<br />Astor<br />Pine<br />Jack N Hoff<br />White Out<br />Colorblack<br />Heatfan<br />Lunarpursuit<br />StExo<br /><br />many others<br /><br />and of course the man himself....<br /><br />the Dread Pirate Roberts<br /><br />good luck to Ross (the alleged old DPR)<br />&nbsp;and more importantly goodluck to the next DPR<br /><br /><br />A virtual toast that all has been and all that can be.<br /><br />
