				Everytime I come here, there&#039;s three or four new accounts posting ridiculous claims or &quot;theories&quot; about why SR is down. It would serve to promote a greater sense of well being if we just stopped people from making new accounts for now.<br /><br />Thanks.

				The problem is that I&#039;m sure there are still legit SR buyers/vendors who don&#039;t user forums who may find themselves here after the downtime and may want to register to message their buyers/vendors....Not really sure closing registrations is a good idea.

				Not everyone who uses SR automatically has a forum account, I know I didn&#039;t until the outage. Thats unfair to all the legitimate buyers/vendors with serious concerns about the well being of their money.

				Just here to echo Breastimus&#039; sentiments. I&#039;m a noob on this forum, but I&#039;ve been an SR patron a while now; I just registered to keep track of my favorite vendors and to keep apprised of the situation. I&#039;m sure there are scores of users like me who&#039;ve registered during the downtime and not made any sort of stink at all. Just a thought! :)

				You can&#039;t close forum registrations, that would be like censorship. That&#039;s not to be tolerated.<br /><br />goblin

				I agree,&nbsp; Close down new registration.&nbsp; And to Goblin......if they can close registration to new members to SR, why not SR forums.<br /><br />To many newbies, whether SR vets or not, are getting on the Forums and causing problems, and completely destroying the whole point of forums---useful info!!!
