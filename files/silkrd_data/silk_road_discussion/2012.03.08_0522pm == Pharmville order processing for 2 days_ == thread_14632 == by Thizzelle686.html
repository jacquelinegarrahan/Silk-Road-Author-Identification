				Hey - I don&#039;t have any advice or tips for you, but I know what you&#039;re experiencing.<br /><br />I just PMed Pharmville regarding my order, which was been stuck at processing since Monday around noon.&nbsp; Like you - I did my homework before ordering and don&#039;t doubt that they&#039;re trustworthy people who are terribly overloaded - but timeliness is a concern that cannot be ignored either.<br /><br />I&#039;ve be re-assured by other members that my order has almost certainly shipped - it&#039;s just a matter of time before it arrives.&nbsp; The mail did come today - Thursday - and nothing.&nbsp; I just want to get confirmation from Pharmville everything went out, a DCN would be nice, but not hearing anything puts me on edge&nbsp; . . . <br /><br />Pharmville posted the other day saying all the DCNs went out, but I never got one, which only contributed to my anxiety.&nbsp; Hopefully Pharville can login for a minute and clear this up, or check their PMs and update us on our orders.<br /><br />I&#039;m not worried AT ALL about being scammed or anything, I have NO DOUBT that they are good-honest-reliable people, but I&#039;d stilll feel better if those of us who haven&#039;t received a DCN, or our pack, or an order-status update could at least hear something from the vendor.<br /><br />When did you order Thizzelle686?&nbsp; First order with Pharmville?

				I first ordered on Monday and they told me that I needed to re order.&nbsp; I placed the re order on Tuesday and haven&#039;t had any update since.&nbsp; It is my first order from them.&nbsp; I also trust these guys and know that they are the best on this site, but none the less it is still concerning when you have your money tied up.&nbsp; With all that being said, I&#039;m sure they will end up taking care of the situation.

				No more DCNs are being sent out. New policy - read their seller page. They&#039;re only necessary if say a week went by and no shipment received. Then just send a PM to Pharmville after that time and you&#039;ll get the DCN. But if you bought on Monday, expect your package today thru Saturday depending on method. If Tuesday, expect Sat or Mon. <br /><br />Pharmville is too busy to answer noob &quot;where&#039;s my order? Did it ship?&quot; questions. It&#039;s just a few guys packing and shipping a fuck ton of orders. Their security (which in turn is your security) is far more important than putting one&#039;s mind at ease for an order that will come in a day or two anyway. <br /><br />So don&#039;t worry. Your older will come. And don&#039;t rate them low when your order arrives because they didn&#039;t answer your PMs. Put yourself in their shoes. They are taking an extraordinary risk to bring you high quality merchandide at the some of the lowers price on SR. <br /><br />Once you get past the nail biting, you&#039;re going to be very happy when the item arrives.

				I would just feel more comfortable if I could see my order go from &quot;processing&quot; to &quot;in transit&quot;.&nbsp; Like I said, I trust these guys but a little discretion goes a long way.

				Exactly. Both Tony76 and Pharmville get the lion share of orders on Silk Road. And they both always ship out with 24 to 48 hours. Rarely if ever make a mistake. <br /><br />PMing on TOR is a slow process. Imagine answering hundreds of PM which because of Tor&#039;s low speed, takes 5+ minutes to respond to each? <br /><br />Seeing processing is much better than having to finalize before a vendor will ship. <br /><br />You order will likely say in transit on the day you receive your order. And your buyer stats will look good because you&#039;ll be finalizing upon receiving shipment. <br /><br />If by Saturday your order doesn&#039;t arrive, title your PM, &quot;Ordered Monday, It&#039;s Saturday and nothing arrived.&quot; This way, by title alone, they will see that it is a real issue and not just another impatient noob thinking this is Amazon dot com.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Don&#039;t sweat it Thizz. I ordered from them for the first time on Saturday and my order sat in processing as well. It didn&#039;t get changed to &quot;in transit&quot; until Wednesday about an hour before my order arrived in the mail. I heard someone else say that they have received an order while their order was still in processing and couldn&#039;t finalize until the next day. I think they just prioritize shipping over changing the status of the order.

				I&#039;m sort of in the same boat as some of you guys. I placed my order Monday around noon-ish, then the next day I read Pharmville&#039;s profile about the order cut-off of 9am, but the wrinkle here is that I am out of town this week, so I put down the hotel that I&#039;m staying at. However, I will be flying back home tomorrow morning, and my order has not arrived yet, so I talked to the front desk and asked them to forward me the package, if it arrives here. I did send Pharmville a PM asking that if it hasn&#039;t shipped then please ship to my house, but I&#039;m afraid that message wasn&#039;t read.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m sure it will work out, I may end up getting it late, but I&#039;m confident it will come. I&#039;ve ordered from these guys a few times before and they&#039;ve been excellent so far. I couldn&#039;t wait for them to come back from that unfortunate death in the family one of them had to deal with. If I knew they were extremely back-logged this week, I would&#039;ve put my home address in there in the first place!<br /><br />Well, I&#039;ll deal with it, I put some other orders in with some other people for some other goodies to keep me occupied while I wait for this order!

				Billy, Billy, Billy.... that&#039;s a tricky situation. Not the smartest of moves either. What if a hotel clerk who&#039;s a do-gooder opens the package? You could then be looking at a controlled delivery to your house. And now you have a man-in-middle as a witness to confirm you were expecting the package and had it forwarded to your residence knowing its contents. Across state lines and all. I could be wrong, but looks like federal jurisdiction.<br /><br />Me? I&#039;d chalk it up to a loss and abandon that package. By forwarding it, you lose plausible deniability. Can&#039;t blame Pharmville on this one. You didn&#039;t factor USPS shipping time properly. <br /><br />Brother, I hope all goes well. But I wouldn&#039;t have forwarded that package. And from a hotel no less? Man, you can&#039;t trust a mofo out in the wild. <br /><br />Tell the hotel, never mind. Seriously. Of it it&#039;s too late, be like, &quot;who? don&#039;t know who that is. Wasn&#039;t expecting a package from anyone by that name.&quot;&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to chance shit coming down on your head. <br /><br />Be safe. Keep an eye out. Peace.

				It&#039;s all good my man. Here&#039;s what I did: I changed my flight from a morning to an afternoon flight so I could hang out and wait for the mail to arrive. So when I went down for breakfast in the morning, I told the front desk I was expecting a package today (I think I said it was a flash drive that I needed for work ASAP) and to please call my cell when it arrives. Sure enough by around noon, the mail came, my package arrived, the front desk called me, I picked it up without incident, and I was on my way back home.<br /><br />For those back home, I simply told them I had to stay for a half day or so more to finish up some of the work I was doing. I put my goodies in with a bottle of Tylenol and got through airport security just fine.<br /><br />You were right about a few things, it was a risky move on my part, but the receptionist was very professional, kind, and accommodating, especially since the night before, there was a maintenance guy in my room 2 or 3 times trying to look for a water leak as the room directly below me had water leaking into his room (the leak turned out to be one of the main water lines in between the floors.....i.e. NOT coming from my room). They, of course, had to turn the water off to repair that, too. So she knew that I had to put up with someone coming into my room several times, which is obviously annoying and something I shouldn&#039;t have to put up with, and having to go without water for several hours. Therefore, if she was going to be difficult about forwarding me a document-sized envelope, then she&#039;d get a mouthful (and formal complaint) from me about the maintenance guys who were bothering me and then banging pipes around until pretty late at night.<br /><br />As far as abandoning the package, it was probably one of the largest orders I&#039;ve placed to date, it was quite substantial so I really didn&#039;t want to let it go. Everything is fine now, but I will definitely be smarter about these things in the future. I was lucky, that&#039;s for sure. Trust me, I have learned from this and won&#039;t let it happen again, I spent a sleepless night learning a few lessons which came from me worrying and the paranoia you turned me on to.<br /><br />Thank you for the advice though, I appreciate you looking out for a newbie like me and your insight regarding this matter. Peace man!!
