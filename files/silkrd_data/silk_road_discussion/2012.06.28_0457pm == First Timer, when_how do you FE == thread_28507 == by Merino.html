				Despite suggestions to buy five books or other items to get on of the FE weeds. I decide to make small purchases of well . . . what I&#039;m really on SR to score. I have plenty of books. I know I have to FE with these vendors and placed my orders, but I don&#039;t see an option to final. Under the &quot;Auto-Finalize&quot; column of my order page it says &quot;N/A.&quot; Does the option to finalize only present itself later? Or am I missing something and can finalize now?

				No, the seller will activate it, you just need to wait. It can take a couple of days sometimes before they log in.

				After the vendor marks it in transit you&#039;ll be able to finalize, then they&#039;ll ship it. So you might be waiting a day or so for them to mark it sent.<br /><br />Do a careful search of the forum for the vendors name before you FE. Even then its a bad idea, established vendors still might not send your stuff. (cough**UKpharm*cough)<br /><br />Buy really small untill you&#039;re out of FE territory.<br />

You are correct with making your first few purchases small. but try to find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require. you can send them a message and ask first. <br /><br />For my first couple of transactions I went with a vendor that required it for everyone. that way I didn&#039;t feel singled out and was treated the same.

				You should never FE unless you trust the vendor enough to FE. If the vendor requires you to FE, just assume youre throwing money at a gamble unless they are an established vendor that will refund you portions of it even though you FEd. Good luck SRing

It even had 14.6 grams in it as opposed to the 14 that I paid for, so I&#039;m a happy customer!!! He really came through even though he may have screwed&nbsp; up in that whole mess from above. I hope he learned from this, because the transaction went lovely! It arrived in GREAT packaging. If you can&#039;t find it after you receive it, you *REALLY* have to look hard to find it. Mad props and great first time experience.
