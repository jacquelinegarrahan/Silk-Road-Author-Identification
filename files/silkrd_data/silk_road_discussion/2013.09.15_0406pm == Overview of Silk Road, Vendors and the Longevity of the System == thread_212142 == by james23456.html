				I&#039;m taking the time to write this post, as it has been something that has been on my mind for a good while now.<br /><br />I have been using SR for a while, and have had excellent experiences with it thus far. Now, as someone who is looking to be a prospective vendor in the future, I have always been curious about the lives of the Vendors who sell the product. I&#039;m not naive enough to believe that every vendor on here is a &#039;gangster&#039; in real life, and lives what I would call a gangsters lifestyle. While some on here may live that life, I also believe that some are just looking to make some cash on the side, and do it part time, whilst also holding down a &#039;legitimate&#039; career, and others doing it full time are just normal people, who happen to be weed farmers or whatever.<br /><br />I come from a background in industry, and it is what I&#039;m presently in, five days a week, full time. I wonder sometimes if vendors have left their original (legit) careers to become a full time vendor on here and make what was once their recreational activities into a full time career? <br /><br />On the other hand, people who have been dealers IRL must think this is a God send to them, taking away face-to-face meets and making the full transaction anonymous.<br /><br />Lastly, I assume that any prospective vendor must be wondering what the future is going to be like for the SR, and whether they will be able to make a full time career out of it, for many years to come. I know I am.<br /><br />And finally, I greatly respect the current vendors on here, who do what they do and bring us great products. <br /><br />It would be great to have your thoughts and opinions on this guys. Thanks and peace to you all. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Nice thoughts although a full time career in anything illegal is never a good idea. The dealers who last longest are the ones who do it alongside a legitimate income so that it doesn&#039;t arouse suspicion when you spend your earnings. We live in the digital age where pretty much everything you do is monitored to some degree so buying expensive things when you don&#039;t appear to have a legitimate career, and not paying tax etc are all things that can be picked up on. You should use it more as a way to enhance your current lifestyle without sticking out like a sore thumb. Live comfortably not greedily. If anything SR makes it easier for people to have it as a side to real employment as you don&#039;t have fiends hanging off a payphone etc. Anyway I am rambling now........ ;D

I have cut down a but on sales outside of SR because SR makes it easier and more professional.<br />I no longer have to deal with people wanting drugs around the clock. It is a part time thing that helps me afford things I wouldn&#039;t be able to with just a job, without being extravagant.<br />

				I have known quite a few &quot;gangsters&quot;. They are all freakin morons. I doubt any of them are on here using proxies, VPNs, and encryption to profitably sell drugs in a safe manner. They&#039;d much rather shoot each other over dime bags. That&#039;s much cooler.

				I know someone who used to sell. Without going into too much detail, it&#039;s mostly just like doing a legit mail-order business; hard work sorting out orders, packing them up (usually with vacuum machines and the like), regular trips to post (though with the added ass-ache of having to avoid a routine). You need to look at it just like any other business; work out how much profit you make for a sale, how many sales you&#039;d need to make to make a decent living, how feasible it is to be doing that much business. For instance I have considered doing some shroom business, but if I&#039;m selling them at $15 a hit (say - dunno what it actually is right now), with a 90% margin (growing myself means bigger profit margins), so $13.50 a hit, but I wanna make $2000/month (I&#039;m not greedy) I would need to sell around 150 hits per month, that means I would need to grow 1.5+ kg shrooms a month (wet-weight) - alot of shrooms! And as a worst-case sceneario, where all sales are 1 hit, I&#039;d be sending out nearly 40 parcels a week. It&#039;d take alot to make it a full-time business...<br /><br />Regarding their personality; They&#039;re not a &#039;gangster&#039;. They&#039;re laid back hippies, who likes to be working for themselves in their own time. They don&#039;t mind the hard work. They like to read and get outdoors. It simply suited their lifestyle.

				I think most people that are vendors are relatively smart. You can definitely tell the ones who aren&#039;t. I saw a review on a vendor named MrNiceGuy007 or something awhile back, someone ordered 3g&#039;s of shrooms, and it took weeks for the package to get there, and when it got there the package reeked of pot. He sent like 3g&#039;s of BlueBerry Kush and 1G of mushrooms, and didn&#039;t even package it right. If I were to become a vendor I would make a set amount of money and leave because when you get greedy that&#039;s when you get busted.
