				It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re WDing. I&#039;ve been through the worst but you be a man, don&#039;t beg and don&#039;t be a scum bag just to get high a little earlier, or just to get money. You give all rec drug users/abusers a worse name than we already have. No need to really bash on you types, you&#039;re either weak or struggle with self-hate or low self-esteem.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed an uptick in vendors reporting incidents; mostly involving threats of 1/5&#039;s or dragging shit out with SR admin and just being petty. Minus 2 or 3 or 4 % points can affect a vendors rep and sales just because you think this is like any regular e-commerce store and feel entitled, or you just scam for cash.<br /><br />I know a lot of you are just scraping by, and a decent amount of you are willing to do scummy stuff IRL to get your DOC so doing it online anonymously isn&#039;t exactly a moral dilemma. But we have a higher proportion of drug nerds and friendly psychonauts who wouldn&#039;t scam a fly I like to think, compared to average street coppers. But I guess being the Big Dog in this game we will attract all types. (SIDE NOTE: I realize not all vendors are innocent in these matters, they scam too, but there&#039;s a lot more of us than there are of them).<br /><br />So when I see long time 98%-100% rated vendors dealing with this shit, they have no smart legitimate reason to selectively scam, and your anger is probably better directed at USPS. Plus they if they do it just enough they are knocked out of the top tier vendors and their rep is shot, absent an SR admins/vendors conspiracy theory. And if you&#039;re just scamming, like I said, you hate yourself deep inside (unless you&#039;re a sociopath or close to it, then no real negative mental/emotion impact for you I guess, fuckers..)<br /><br /><br />So what I REALLY want to say is I think the buyer Blacklists I&#039;ve been seeing lately are a great idea and should spread, and greater restrictions on noobs (I know it can cut into profits, but so does a dupe scammer accounts and clueless noobs and kids ya know?). I believe these things would create less hassle for the adult intelligent buyers (and people who really need meds) as well as less time wasted and around equal or more profit in the long run for vendors.

				I would say that late finalizing or auto-finalizing is more of a problem from the point of view of the average vendor than actual scamming buyers.<br /><br />For some vendors, scamming buyers just comes with the territory. Dealers in meth or heroin are often selling to desperate people. It is very easy for those buyers to turn scammer. For most other vendors I think it is quite rare.

				I can see that totally. As a buyer who gets, the shit, tries the shit, takes 5 mins (15 is SR is slow) I don&#039;t see how if someone hooked u up fat that u&#039;d wait the 17 or 18 days before they get back... It&#039;s so easy not to get an auto-finalize on your rap sheet, might be a little harder for the downer fans but come on.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen auto-finalizers on any Blacklists yet, I&#039;ve seen like 3 just pop up from some vendors, hope they&#039;re included.<br /><br />There&#039;s just an attitude of &quot;this place exists, it owes me, the customer is always right&quot; so I hope some of you I&#039;m talking about who prob won&#039;t comment at least read this. You&#039;re fucking it up for the rest of us. And coop or business where 50% of the time is spent on customer service is insane (unless you&#039;re a call center).<br /><br />I liked the hard-ass approach I&#039;ve been seeing from some venders. Like there&#039;s someone who makes people repeat that they will abide by all their rules etc in the address box just for his own protection or he&#039;ll mostly likely cancel your off that.

				Good to hear some of this, you&#039;d expect it from the H and C crowd, and the users would even cop to that. I just went from seeing no Blacklists listed publicly on profiles to seeing them on half of the few I visited recently. Liked what I saw just hope it picks up. I don&#039;t think private for-Vendor&#039;s-eyes-only blacklists do enough deterrence as listing the customers name right in the pub profile. I&#039;ve seen posts in the forum already from buyers bitching (I go case by case, this guy was petty as fuck)<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s the scummy or annoying customer who gets mentioned more in an angry tones in the profiles, and we as buyers don&#039;t really hear about the auto FE&#039;s because time has passed...<br /><br />I vote for a fast 20 part quiz to be a buyer!

				I know a vendor who just started.&nbsp; They got messages from other vendors warning of certain scam buyers.&nbsp; Those very same scam buyers showed up on the doorstep as the first customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;imagine that .<br /><br />A few threats were already received that if it wasn&#039;t done right they would do this and that in the forums.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is bullying going on in the forums too. But that&#039;s business. . . <br /><br />There are clearly scam buyers cruising the site looking for new vendors to exploit.&nbsp; &nbsp;They know they will bend backwards for the first few feedbacks.&nbsp; &nbsp;The vendors need them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />This just encourages vendors to ask friends to buy their gear,&nbsp; to be able to correct the feedbacks that assholes left behind.&nbsp; Feedback is becoming tainted now.&nbsp; &nbsp;They need to clean it up.&nbsp; Or else everybody&#039;s best friends will be in control of a vendors&#039; product feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;Buyers will hurt themselves in the end.&nbsp; Don&#039;t abuse feedback.<br /><br />Extortion is an old game.<br />There are ways to deal with these people too.&nbsp; It takes cooperation between vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not just the ones in the vendor forum either.&nbsp; That just makes the newbie vendors bait and a red herring.&nbsp; Good practice and training though I guess. .

				I&#039;m not sure there is a way to deal with scamming buyers, since it only takes a minute to register a new account. And there are always some vendors agreeing to deal with new members, so I really don&#039;t see what could prevent a scamming buyer from having free drugs. Sad, but true.

				That&#039;s good news.<br /><br />I often wonder is scam buyers / unreasonable buyers are really just anti-drug people, trying to frustrate the sellers, or even competitive vendors slowing others down with fake accounts.&nbsp; But I&#039;m paranoid and think that way. Don&#039;t mind me. <br /><br />A post above said scammers came as soon as he started selling coke.&nbsp; I think that was competition at work, making a statement about stepping on their toes, otherwise why just coke. Coke users are not all scammers, most have money and jobs and no time for scams.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think street level users wouldn&#039;t be here scamming,&nbsp; because their computer would be at the hock shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-o&nbsp; &nbsp; Oooh. That one hurt.

				An old friend and I were sharing an SR account for awhile, and I recently opened up my own account.&nbsp; As a user who received chocolate smelling heroin from a top selling vendor with a 99-feedback, I was a afraid of leaving bad feedback on a new SR account because I dont want other vendors to think I am a scammer.&nbsp; So I was stuck leaving false feedback to protect myself.

				First off, if you can&#039;t afford it, that should be a red flag to maybe take a break or you have a problem.&nbsp; When Bitcoins crashed a couple weeks ago, I used it as a excuse to give my liver a rest.&nbsp; Maybe SR should have a ratings method for buyers as well to warn other vendors. If it got so bad that I had to start scamming vendors to get my shit, I&#039;d stop. Some times its good to give your body a rest.&nbsp; When you start again, you need less amount then normal to get high.&nbsp; It makes a big difference when you clean out your liver.&nbsp; Also, abuse starts when you need more an more to get high.

				We had a few suspect &#039;no shows&#039; and also a few &#039;buyers&#039; with no actual SR purchase number or date of purchase demanding refunds.<br /><br />Basically people will try it on but by and large most customers receive and pay up as soon as it lands.<br /><br />We always send out, funny enough when buying from other vendors on other accounts it always arrives!<br /><br />Never a no show buying but selling another story.<br /><br />And free samples always land also!<br /><br />&nbsp;::)

				Selling psychedelics we rarely get scammed or threatened and maybe close to 95% of our customers are sympathetic and honest. However, to keep yourself in the game and keep your ratings high, vendors will most definitively need to bow down to these scammers once in a while. Loosing a bit of money to a scammer is better than loosing a part of the market. Sometimes, you have to concede and that sucks.

				The amount of SR opportunists has definitely been on the rise. All in all these buyers are a minority but dealing with enough of them at once really does potentially ruin the experience for the next buyer to come. Essentially the feedback system needs an overhaul which would help alleviate many of these situations but I would have to say scam/ questionable buyers are frequent.
