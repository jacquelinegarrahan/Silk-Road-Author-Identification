				So about 20 minutes ago I gave my wife of 9 years a little green pill. I told her that the pill was a sleeping pill, which I was not lying about that. Little did she know the pill I gave her was actually a 1mg Rohypnol better known as a roofie. In about an hour or so I plan to go upstairs and DATE RAPE MY WIFE! A fantasy a lot of guys like myself have dreamed of. I will be taking many pictures and cumming on her in places she has never let me before. :)<br /><br /><br />+1 Karma Please :P<br /><br />Perhaps I&#039;ll sell some pics or a vid on the road for a buck or two.

It wasn&#039;t something I ever expected anyways. Also, I felt they were trying to hard to preserve the streak when it really didn&#039;t matter in the grand scheme of things. Over-exerting and taking on a potential injury wouldn&#039;t have been worth it. <br /><br />With that being said, that bulls games was intense. Especially the last 5 minutes. Some real bullshit went down, but whatever. I&#039;m kinda glad we lost so we can chill for a bit now.

				With this you could mess with her subconscious and she could develop repulsive feelings towards you. On the other hand, her subconscious may work on your side and she may ask you to be more naughty.&nbsp;

				i think the fact that it&#039;s someone you have a long term relationship with who has a great amount of trust in you makes it a somewhat more despicable action, comparative to the family members who molest their nieces, nephews and grandchildren etc. it blows my mind how you can all be so flippant about rape.

Again I would learn toward yes on this but with each case being unique, such as this one, I would definitely not treat magicbeats the same as any other rapist. Again these are just my opinions.

				&quot;for better or for worse&quot; does that include your spouse acting upon deviant fantasies, drugging and sexually violating you without your knowledge? imo if the other party does not consent then it&#039;s rape, there is no grey area. <br />if your partner drugged and anally raped you in the security of your own home, boasted and laughed about it online or with her friends and offered to share photos would you be fine with it? do you consider your marriage vows as consent for you and her to do whatever you feel like against the others wishes? relationships are about love, compromise, communication and mutual trust. sounds like you don&#039;t value a single one of those things. i feel bad for your wife presuming you&#039;re not just trolling. maybe it&#039;s just my damn xx chromosomes making me all emotional about the subject ::) i&#039;m glad i&#039;m not the only anti rape person on here, was starting to get a bit disturbed at the cavalier attitudes expressed.

				When I saw this thread title, I presumed that the wife was the one who would have asked for it - one of those dark fantasies. Sadly, it just seems like someone who met the person they love, and about to do something completely cruel to that person :( makes me quite sad.<br /><br />Not my place to judge, but I hope you will at least to take time to analyse the emotional effects this will have not only on you, but on your wife. After all, where will it stop now that you are willing to do this? And if you have kids what then?<br /><br />An important thing I recall hearing is that rape never has anything to do with love, just a show of control and power.

				I call bullshit on this one. <br /><br />Even to &#039;advertise&quot; it as an (awesome story) - . . . . that hasn&#039;t happened yet???<br /><br /><br />Just because it&#039;s called a &#039;date-rape&#039; drug, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s an aphrodisiac! - It gets that from the fact that it&#039;s water soluble, and basically tasteless, but really, it&#039;s just another benzo like Valium or Xanax. It doesn&#039;t turn someone into a willing recipient of sex! <br /><br />I doubt he&#039;s doing any of this. <br /><br />He&#039;s just over the 50 posts, and is probably suffering from NAWS<br /><br />Just like the one who wanted to do his stepsister. Morons. <br /><br />They finally find this great site, and this is what they do on it? - Good thing I&#039;m not a mod. I&#039;d flush this one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Newbie Attention Whore Syndrome

				Methinks... if you don&#039;t know their relationship, sexual or otherwise then don&#039;t dis the guy. If his wife is very frigid or doesn&#039;t put out because shes not attracted to him anymore, has a low libido or whatever else then its a little sketchy. In the end, the only thing that would really decide whether it was wrong or not would be: if he told her that he did it, how much would she care? Non at all, kinda, omfg you raped me or maybe she would just laugh. Like honestly Ron and a few others are being way zealous. If I did that to my GF and told her, she would laugh her arse off and be turned on. People have different relationships. I think its fucking rude as shit to rip on him without knowing the dynamics and detail, grow up. All in all, comparing this to child molestation is just fucking retarded... like... fully retarded. Also, I&#039;m a good 96% sure hes trolling but you never know.

				i don&#039;t know. he&#039;s a vendor and this is the kind of pr stunt that would only hurt business unless he&#039;s selling rohypnol to his fellow rapists... and yeah ghb is the more recreational date rape type drug is it not?? this bloke just wants to fuck a warm corpse :o but i can&#039;t see this thread having a positive impact on his vendor image in general.

				When I said rape is non consensual I was imply that consent can be given before or after the fact. It really comes down to: does she care? If she does, then yeah, I&#039;d say that&#039;s rape. If she doesn&#039;t, or actually found it erotic, then no, I&#039;d say that was consent after the fact.<br /><br />You know what I&#039;m saying.

				Lol heatfan. She doesnt know I raped her so its not rape? So you could just rape any woman whos unconsious and it&#039;d be okay, because shes didnt say no? <br />Being unconsious makes it hard to consent dont ya think?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140101.msg953673#msg953673">Quote from: MagicBeats on March 29, 2013, 11:32 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">... cumming on her in places she has never let me before. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Pretty sure that line clears up what she would think of it. If he has to drug her to do the things he wants, there is no consent there. How stupid are some people.<br />The reality is that this is most likely a troll, but the worst part is always the people who think its okay.
