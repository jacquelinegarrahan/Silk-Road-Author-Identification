				You can finalize whenever you would like I believe but you should not finalize till you have received what you purchased ! as for the other questions hopefully someone that has done more transactions could chime in.

And you shouldn&#039;t finalize until you receive the product. A delay is probably either the seller is backed up on orders, or he is just getting the package ready to be shipped, and waiting on the post to pick it up before marking it as &quot;In Transit&quot;.<br />But the way to finalize is to go to your orders (top of page on SR) and click finalize, give it a rating 1-5 and type in a comment/feedback about the product. However, you cannot finalize until the seller has marked the product as &quot;In Transit&quot;. Once he does, a finalize link will appear. But take note that finalizing is final (hence the name), and once you do it you can&#039;t get that money back, which is why you should always wait until you receive the product to avoid getting scammed.

				I would recommend that you dont finalize. I would also recommend that you do a little more reading and study about what Silk Road is and how it operates. Read the forum and get a feel for the vendors you are going to make a purchase from. Choose only high ranking vendors because you will probably have to finalize early since you are new.

There is no point leaving feedback before you receive the product. All of this &quot;Finalizing early!&quot; feedback shit really pisses me off. Anyway, read the listing and the sellers page before you purchase, if it says on either one that they will not ship until you finalize, of course you need to make finalize as early as possible, otherwise just do it when you receive the goods. If you don&#039;t wanna finalize early, then don&#039;t buy from a seller that has this policy. Simples.

				&nbsp; Then you end up frustrated, with no weed. Most of the vendors have policies that make you buy smaller amounts prior to buying in bulk. For both parties&#039; protection.<br />

				What&#039;s worse is the trend of seemingly almost all vendor&#039;s holding international buyer&#039;s by the balls.<br /><br />They refuse to ship unless finalized early.&nbsp; There&#039;s very few Canadian vendors, and the US consider&#039;s Canada International, so i&#039;ve been forced to finalize early on almost all of my order&#039;s because otherwise I would never be able to obtain that product, from any vendor otherwise (since they ALMOST ALL require international finalize early).<br /><br />I make sure I make note of my concern to the vendor at the time of sale, but that won&#039;t change anything.&nbsp; <br />The one time I do end up getting screwed too and trying to inform the forum&#039;s i&#039;ll be met with &#039;you&#039;re an idiot for finalizing early&#039;.&nbsp; Tell that to ALMOST ALL the vendors who would prevent me from obtaining the product PERIOD (as in every vendor of the product requires finalizing early) if I didn&#039;t finalize early

				To be fair, the finalizing process is a tad confusing your first time through.&nbsp; I made the same mistake of thinking you had to rate it as part of the finalizing process on my first order.&nbsp; Maybe the order status should just change to &quot;Finalized&quot; with a &quot;Rate Your Order&quot; option next to it.&nbsp; The problem I have is that no one ever goes back to edit the review later.

Iv never been asked to finalize early touch wood, except on a couple of occasions where iv asked the vendor to do me a favour, all worked out well though. <br />I&#039;m presently wanting to buy some quality H but seeing as the H vendors are international from me they all insist int orders must finalize early, so if i want it then i gotta do it, i don&#039;t like it but no choice. <br />Oh, BTW Pharmakarma, what do mean by setting off security settings? Are vendors protected this way? It&#039;s good if they are cos that was one of my worries about starting vending.
