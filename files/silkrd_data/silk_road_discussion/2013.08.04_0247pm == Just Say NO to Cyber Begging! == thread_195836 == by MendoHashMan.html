				I can&#039;t be the only seller getting messages from these homebums of SR, they say they want to buy a pricey item from me but are a couple dollars short, they don&#039;t ask for a custom listing, they ask me to send them the difference, any time I have done this, I never hear from them again! I would rather give that money to a dirty street bum then some digital beggar sitting in their moms basement! <br /><br />If you are a few dollars short, try your luck at a BTC casino, or have some patience and wait until it is worth a little more, or, the option I will now give people, send me everything you have and if you really are that close, I&#039;ll send what you want... They want me to send money out of escrow with no real guarentee, so why not ask them for the same thing? My stats are great and public info, if you don&#039;t trust me, what makes you think I should trust you? I am not going to waste any more time on custom listings that never sell, not sending money to any beggars, not falling for your sob story! There is no &quot;Take a BTC, leave a BTC&quot; jar on my desk, sorry!<br /><br />Everyone!!! Refuse to support cyber beggars!!! Every IRL store I know would kick a beggar out, make the bum sit on a cold sidewalk and ask for change there! If you are a few bucks short, do what all the other bums do for their drug fix, sit on the sidewalk with a sign, wash some car windshields, blow a business man behind a dumpster, then take the money you made, buy some more BTC, then come buy my drugs!!!<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m a little riled up, but I just don&#039;t get these people that believe they are entitled to free money!

				Ugh yes. The scum of SR. You can find their home over at the Official Spare Coins Thread. Offering free samples is like throwing bread crumbs at a new york park; pigeons descend from every corner grabbing yanking and pulling without a hello or goodbye.<br /><br />&quot;PLEASE SIR CAN I HAVE JUST 0.01 BITCOIN?

				Don&#039;t give in to these... persons. They are panhandling. <br /><br />So they come to you with promises of future opportunity if only you could show them kindness now. Consider, they have been doing this from a point a little after SR started. <br /><br />If you must reply, direct them to go look up BTC faucets. There are a few out there they can try to exploit.

Well in your case...you didn&#039;t fall for it. And you give a great explanation of how to avoid it if you are a vendor... you just tell them that you will make a custom listing for the amount they have. Of course he WILL NEVER buy the listing.<br /><br />He has been pulling this for over a year...and you would be shocked how many vendors fall for it. Not just once..but a few times ...meaning he contacted the vendor and said I want to purchase X but I am .25 short....and the vendor sends him the .25...then he says...&quot; thanks for the .25...BUT since you sent it to me...the btc fluctuated again! And now I am .18 short...and then the vendor sent .18 to him!!! <br /><br />This has happened multiple times as there was a thread about him and this very scam in the vendor thread and a couple vendors came forward to say they got taken.<br /><br />This is TOTALLY different then a buyer being a few dollars short, meaning .05 btc, for an order and someone helping them out. And that is what the Spare Coins thread is all about. Sure there are lying scumbags in there...but I would say 98% of the members just really need the help. And luckily for this thread ..they can get it. Also this thread helps many a vendor as the people could not make the purchase or would need to make one for less if they did not get the few dollars they needed.<br /><br />In this thread these two things were totally blurred. They are VERY DIFFERENT. The one the OP is talking about&nbsp; is a scam attempt. Period. And the OP just didn&#039;t realize that is what it is. It is not someone asking for free shit or someone that is trying to get the vendor to hook them up. In fact he was not a cyber beggar at all. He is a total thief that is a broke dick and is addicted to drugs. And he gets them by scamming members and getting vendors to give him money.<br /><br />

				Are you fucking serious, people contact vendors and ask them to send the alleged difference between what they have and the listing price so they can order then fuck off with the coins? I don&#039;t know what is more retarded, buyers asking for the BTC or vendors actually sending it.<br /><br />

				A nice feature request would be &quot;ignore user&quot;.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I wish certain vendors wouldn&#039;t show up in my search results -so it could be beneficial for both sides of the equation.

				I totally agree Rx. The thing is though, it&#039;s always the same people, now a couple of them are decent, and they use it as a sort of club where they meet and chat. Which is fine, but this mary666 is a proper pauper, scavenging&nbsp; like a vulture. Every fucking day, in and out she will be there, tom thumbing ( bumming). Then the little snake just trotts in and out of other threads, wont bother to read them, just straight in and troll troll troll, and then back the club. mary666 (sic)&nbsp; I hope they can see you&#039;re unquantifiably disturbed, and judgment day is coming.

Me personally I would never post on here asking but that&#039;s just me, and I always buy more coin than I need to make sure I&#039;m not short, then what ever I got left I stoll thru the forums looking for people that are short and seem like they really need it and aren&#039;t just panhadling.

I have given plenty of money and food to homeless people and people just down on their luck, but there is no reason to give money to some teenager who&#039;s mommy didn&#039;t give them enough drug money in this weeks allowance! <br /><br />I met a homeless guy in a popular beach town in California one time, I talked with and hung out with the guy for a while and he told me he has brought in over 200$ in less then 4 hours on a good day, he also told me that a lot of homeless people in the right towns bring in over $100k a year! Kinda makes you rethink that $7/hr McDonalds job! There are people making a living wage just by holding their hand out while other people work 2 jobs and are still falling further into debt and I do not support that!<br /><br />I prefer to buy a homeless person food over give them money, and these digital beggars I try to give them the desired product at a reduced price, but just like the crack smoking homeless people that don&#039;t want food, these beggars don&#039;t really want my product, just my money! If you really are a little short, ask for a custom listing instead of free money! Still might not get it, but I will respect you more!

				Okay, looking through this thread -the comparison has been made to giving money to street beggars. Never, NEVER give money to a panhandler. Volunteer at a soup kitchen if you feel the need but these people probably are making more money than me.<br /><br />Example 1: http://youtu.be/krg5r6n0kr4 (Sorry if video is hard on our Tor network)<br /><br />Thousands more examples where this came from. <br /><br />People who really need the money ie insane unemployable people -just aren&#039;t very good at panhandling. The people who rise to the top of this profession are grifters.<br /><br />I imagine someone who is sophisticated enough to know what a bitcoin is -is also clever enough to make money spinning some story.<br />

				I think there&#039;s a big difference between scam attempts and the spare coins thread. I&#039;ve certainly never asked anyone for a loan (I&#039;m on some grown man shit), but almost everyone I&#039;ve lent a small amount to has paid me back. Surprising really, that in a totally anonymous community, it&#039;s been safer to loan a few bucks here than IRL. I&#039;ve probably lent about 10 different people 0.01-0.2 btc, and all but one paid me back when they said they would, and most sent back a little extra as thanks. YMMV of course.

				I kind of understand how it happens though. I bought enough BTC to cover a purchase and by the time the coins were in I was under $1 short. A few cents is irrelevant - no option to buy!<br /><br />Instead of messaging the Vendor I went to a different Vendor and bought something cheaper. I wonder if the original Vendor would have preferred that or would have preferred a sub-dollar hit. <br /><br />I have no way of knowing because I didn&#039;t beg.

				A lot of vendors do not mind if a buyer is a fraction of a BTC too short. They will make them a custom listing. <br /><br />But those getting up and arms over a &quot;snooty attitude&quot; failed to realize that when many vendors do offer to make a custom listing to fit the budget of these &quot;beggars,&quot; they decline and ask for the BTC themselves. That&#039;s a scam. <br /><br />BTW, watch out for a buyer that goes by the name i3lazd - runs around asking for samples from as many vendors as he/she can. One vendor who got pissed off at this person who sends you their address along with their hand out request, got banned for being mean to him. Banned? Yep. <br /><br />So have a polite boilerplate decline message saved that you can copy and paste each time these scamming beggars as for something.

				I only used the official spare coins page once. I needed like 4 bucks, and a user sent me $40 by mistake. I could have easily ran off with the extra $36, but I sent it back. Not only that, but i paid the guy like 12 or 15 dollars back the next time i bought BTC. Not all beggars are scummy lol
