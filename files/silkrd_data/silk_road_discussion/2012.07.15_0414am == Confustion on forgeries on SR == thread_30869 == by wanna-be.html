However we cannot jump to conclusions like that, I can imagine it to be a genuine question of curiosity. Of course it`ll be clear what the OP`s intentions are if he goes looking for a vendor to provide that for him, till then its a flat cake.

People who are victims of fraud have to repair their credit ratings and prove they were not involved in the fraud for one example. In the meantime they may not be able to get employed (they check credit rating now), by a house/car/whatever and will have bank issues for years to come. This can often take many years for a victim to get beyond. <br /><br />Think people.&nbsp; There has to be some sort of honor among thieves around here.

				It is rather simple when you think about it... virtually everything that is sold here from Drugs to ID&#039;s to Porn is mainly for personal consumption/use that falls into the DPR category of &#039;Do No Harm&#039;. Now obviously meth is not a harmless substance and ID&#039;s could be used by terrorists to do harm but the main purpose and the reason they are allowed here is the &#039;Main&#039; use for these items is of a personal nature. People buy drugs to get high, they buy ID&#039;s to open PO Boxes, they buy Porn to beat off... bank account info, credit card info, etc.. is not harmless by it&#039;s very nature. There is absolutely NOTHING you can do with peoples credit card info that would not do some unsuspecting person harm. Someone said well what about the banks, that doesn&#039;t harm a person right? I think that is debatable. Have you ever lost your wallet or had it stolen... I bet it did hurt you to go and get all new credit cards or wait for the bank to complete its fraud investigation before they give you your money back... which can take weeks. Plus ripping off the bank does eventually find it&#039;s way back to your pocket in higher fees to cover losses.<br />So your original question was: Many kinds of forgeries are available on the road, but there is no identity theft allowed?&nbsp; Why is this?<br />After reading the responses by Christy and the others I think they did a good job of answering you. I hope this ends the discussion as it really serves no purpose to debate or argue about why someone can&#039;t sell this or that.<br />DPR set this site in motion but in the end it is the Buyers and Vendors who make Silk Road what it is... we like it like this... we DON&#039;T want CP, Hitmen, Credit Card info, etc being sold or traded here. It isn&#039;t what we are about. If that is what you are about then SR may not be for you.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />TJ

Now obviously meth is not a harmless substance and ID&#039;s could be used by terrorists to do harm but the main purpose and the reason they are allowed here is the &#039;Main&#039; use for these items is of a personal nature. People buy drugs to get high, they buy ID&#039;s to open PO Boxes, they buy Porn to beat off... bank account info, credit card info, etc.. is not harmless by it&#039;s very nature. There is absolutely NOTHING you can do with peoples credit card info that would not do some unsuspecting person harm. Someone said well what about the banks, that doesn&#039;t harm a person right? I think that is debatable. Have you ever lost your wallet or had it stolen... I bet it did hurt you to go and get all new credit cards or wait for the bank to complete its fraud investigation before they give you your money back... which can take weeks. Plus ripping off the bank does eventually find it&#039;s way back to your pocket in higher fees to cover losses.<br />So your original question was: Many kinds of forgeries are available on the road, but there is no identity theft allowed?&nbsp; Why is this?<br />After reading the responses by Christy and the others I think they did a good job of answering you. I hope this ends the discussion as it really serves no purpose to debate or argue about why someone can&#039;t sell this or that.<br />DPR set this site in motion but in the end it is the Buyers and Vendors who make Silk Road what it is... we like it like this... we DON&#039;T want CP, Hitmen, Credit Card info, etc being sold or traded here. It isn&#039;t what we are about. If that is what you are about then SR may not be for you.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />TJ<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30869.msg347710#msg347710">Quote from: TrustusJones on July 15, 2012, 11:17 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It is rather simple when you think about it... virtually everything that is sold here from Drugs to ID&#039;s to Porn is mainly for personal consumption/use that falls into the DPR category of &#039;Do No Harm&#039;.

				Best way I could put it is this isn&#039;t a place a criminality, it&#039;s simply a market supplying the average person with a product they can&#039;t get since society has banned it.<br />I would probably be wrong if I said society though. Rather assholes pushing society into thinking drugs = crime when in reality it&#039;s flipped: crime feeds off of illegal drugs.<br />Point I&#039;m trying to make is that I sense that you feel this is a place we&#039;re criminals crawl and morals are discarded. It&#039;s not that at all. It&#039;s a market were people come to independently make a choice to buy and use a product.<br />I can&#039;t see any relation to this marketplace and words like &#039;stolen&#039; or &#039;theft&#039;.
