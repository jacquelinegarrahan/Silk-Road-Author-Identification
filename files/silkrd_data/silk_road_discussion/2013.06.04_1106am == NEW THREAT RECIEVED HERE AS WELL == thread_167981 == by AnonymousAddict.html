Then he goes on to say He is gonna report me to crime stoppers and the DEA etc. <br /><br />Unless i agree to send him 5grand in Bitcoins.. Well This is when i knew it was 100% someone grasping for staws, he then FULLY FUCKS UP and says The UK police are already watching you so send me the money or expect to see the detectives soon..<br /><br />Well to the Genius that wrote this, IM NOT FROM THE UK!! Im from the fuking north Pole u low life fuck!! and I work for santa claus, i will make sure when i come into your house this christmas eve, u will awake with a HUGE Vibrator JAMMED up your low life ass..<br /><br />WTF is the deal with these off the wall Msgs these days.. <br /><br />To Scout, should i even bother to Report him? Or is it not worth it? Also how are u guys letting the vendor greengernade daddy88 or whatever his name is sell fake pills? yea he states NOW THEIR FAKE!! BUT SURE DIDNT WHEN HE CAME TO THE SCENE..

				I just saw a vendor site wherr there was a threat left in the feedback. It was a month old. There several more recent feedbacks. <br /><br />This struck me as kind of odd. Didn&#039;t the vendor complain to admnins? Can&#039;t the admins take it down?&nbsp;

But I will report it since u say to . <br /><br />Seems to be a flood of them going to people. I had 3 other members i know, msg me saying almost the same story. A msg claiming they use to vend, but DPR recruited them etc etc.. Fuck these ppl.. Im sure they are on the forums lurking as well..

				Is this the same inadequate fool who has been trying this scam on with motek? Few people have reported this now, along with different threats. What I would say to the people who are using their&nbsp; address, for drops, you know the place you eat, sleep, tuck your kids in at night, please remember the risk you are putting on your loved ones. If possible use a proxy address or a drop box. It&#039;s worth the extra dollar for peace of mind. If you are using your home address, then use PGP always, it&#039;s clear nobody want&#039;s to use their own address, but some people have no option. Keep in mind you will get crackers who will fish for addresses and try it on. Most people should take measures to ensure they have means to defend themselves, as once your address is out there, your a target. Please don&#039;t underestimate the lengths scammers/blackmailers will go to. be safe.

				Since SR has gone mainstream the sheep have started flooding in. Truth is that the drug crowd is filled up of a lot of pieces of shit. Then you add that into the anonymity of SR and they flourish and exploit it. <br /><br />Honestly, if you get any PMs from anyone on SR that isn&#039;t from a vendor that you have an order in transit/processing with, don&#039;t even read it, just delete it.

				Glad you called it as BS right from the get go mate but as someone else rightly pointed out this type of scam is becoming ever more present and the sad thing is it must be working some of the time to keep them coming back for more. Next time you see a thread warning about the latest PM scam attempt, I dunno maybe something along the lines of &quot;send your BTC to this address and be allowed membership to SR2 the exclusive club&quot; and then go to blockchain and see how many people have fallen for it, it is fucking scary I tell you!<br /><br />You will never be sent a legitimate PM from SR asking for BTC and any threats or messages with links should just be reported and deleted.<br />

				You should have told him thank you for the offer, but in order to complete the paperwork involved to transfer the funds you will need 1,500 EUR first for the bank fees before you can reward him with the 5,000,000 USD in bitcoins because he was chosen to be the beneficiary of a recent inheritance.

				LOL ^^<br /><br />Yea depending on what kinda comp your using u may have to hit more than just the prnt scren button, useually fcn prntscreen or alt fcn prnt screen, then go to paintshop and paste it,<br /><br />gives u a copy of the page your looking at. Again some comps are diff an it takes diff buttons to hit.<br /><br />Google it and then your type of comp and it will tell u.. Some times it will be a pain and print a small capture of it, but its very simple... Google will explain it... or if your a visual leaner go to youtube and watch some one do it!!

Actually it&#039;s Ctrl+Prt Sc<br /><br />I was asking why he said &#039;print screens would be good here&#039;? As if it wasn&#039;t available - Some people actually don&#039;t know how to do a &#039;screen capture&#039;.<br /><br />So, don&#039;t feel so superior when you think you know something that someone else doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />It exposes your shallowness.
