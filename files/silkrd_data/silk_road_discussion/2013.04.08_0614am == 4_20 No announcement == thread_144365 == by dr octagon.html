				Just wondering if I have either missed something, or is DPR &amp; SR not officially announing a 4/20 sale this year?<br /><br />By this time last year it was hype city and vendors were marketing hard.<br /><br />Is it a case of leave it up to the vendors?&nbsp; Is DPR worried about possible server load?<br /><br />Apologies if I have missed something obvious.

				With the amount of bullshit that hit the Road last year after the 04/20 sale, I&#039;m not surprised that there isnt another one.<br /><br />What a fucking fiasco last year...<br /><br /><br />If there is one, I&#039;m avoiding ordering until May.

				The 4/20 scams are blown out of proportion.<br />For the most part the sales went well, there were a few scammers each year that made off with large sums.<br />I&#039;d love to know who won the grand prize the year DPR said they would send someone on a trip - I don&#039;t believe it happened.
