				Greetings!<br />Love and Peace to all fellow SR users!<br /><br />I just found out about this website and I must say, wow.<br />An essentially anonymous marketplace. Who would of thought in this post 9/11 world that we live in where there is a war on privacy and security. <br /><br />I know I am new and I have many forums to read to learn how to keep this place growing. I&#039;d appreciate any advice for a new member like myself. Once again there is much research to do on my part and I hope to interact with many of you kind folk!!<br /><br /><br />-Freedom Lover65

				SR is kinda like picking up someone at a bar.&nbsp; Spend some time getting enough info to make sure it&#039;s safe to move forward.&nbsp; Know you&#039;re going to spend some money so make sure you have enough to cover the tab.&nbsp; When you end up closing the deal make sure your protected, and when both of you get what you want make sure to finalize it right.<br /><br />If you&#039;re cool it could turn into a regular thing.

				1, Learn at least a bit about Tor, and its benefits. <br /><br />2. Use the security subforum, read the stickied threads and take on as many of the suggestions as practically possible.<br /><br />3. Stay domestic unless you live in China/Russia/Aus etc. Yes, weed might be cheaper and better but is the payoff really worth all the extra LE checks? <br /><br />4. Use PGP. Vendors have disclosed that, very generally speaking, only 10% at best use PGP to obfuscate their addresses. Chances are if your vendor is busted the police will have full access to your address, regardless of it being encrypted; however if TSR server is busted there will be no way for LE to find out what name and address are attached to your account name.<br />&nbsp;<br />5. Trust your intuition. If an offer&#039;s too good to be true, or a vendor&#039;s profile looks like its been written by a 14yo do you really want them to hold your personal details? <br /><br />A CLASSIC example of this was a weed vendor called greyfoxx who sold really nice weed at decent prices. <br /><br />In his profile he would visciously attack vendors selling average weed for high prices. He sounded like like a psycho, so avoided him despite good reviews posted by customers.<br /><br />He began posting transcripts with customers, and the final straw was posting a customer&#039;s personal name and address on his vendor profile. <br /><br />_______________________________________________<br /><br />I would say if you follow all these you will be absolutely fine. There is a lot of low-hanging fruit as I mentioned above, who do not use PGP, do not read the forums, FE on ounces of weed, accept &quot;free samples&quot;, use skype to talk to random investigative journalists as evidenced in another thread etc etc etc. Don&#039;t be one of them.<br /><br />Good luck :)&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Buy from us :)&nbsp; *shameless self-promotion*<br /><br />Okay serious -&gt;&nbsp; The tips from others are great..lurk around a while &amp; read ,read, read-<br /><br /><br />NEVER FE ! USE GPG favorably in a VM with Linux or Liberte, Tails OS-<br /><br />&amp; read about bitcoin so you will not get burned on price fluctuations (which get less as time goes by).<br /><br />Cheers!

				Thanks to All!!<br /><br />All of you guys have good advice!! I&#039;m sure this will be a pleasureful experience. <br /><br />Im not a weed guy really. More into tripping. :P I have seen Buddhanature sells some pretty interesting items and he is in the top 8% of TSR. I will be trying to get some things from him soon. <br /><br />Once again thanks to all who responded.<br /><br />Peace and good vibes! <br /><br />-FreedomLover65
