				Hello all and welcome to the Grand Opening of the SpookDrFeelgood Boutique! <br />Visit us at: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/61a459a09c<br /><br />Currently we focus upon a single product, tested by a certified and licensed organic chemist as 100% pure MDMA, which is increasingly hard to find.&nbsp; Often &quot;high-grade&quot; or (approximately) 80% pure products are offered, but we pride ourselves on offering only 100% pure compounds.<br /><br />If you have any doubt as to the purity of our product, we invite you to verify further via EcstasyData.org. <br /><br />We are pleased that some have already done so, see for example, http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2470. <br /><br />Our goal is to continue to offer nothing but 100% pure compounds, in fully reliable manner, building trust throughout the market as we go. <br /><br />**Because we are new here, this price is a limited-time offer for the first 3 customers! Each customer may purchase either:<br />1. Up to 5 capsules at the 25% discount (normally $20 per capsule, now $15 for a 140mg strong dose!)<br />2. Up to 1 gram at the 25% discount (normally $100 per gram, now $75!)**<br /><br />Thank you for your interest, and we very much look forward to serving you.<br />

				As soon as the vendor started waffling about having 100% pure MDMA I was put off. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think its even possible to get 100% pure MDMA, and even if it was, we would need more evidence than just what you say to consider trusting you.

Even so, we have had our product sent for independent tests by EcstasyData.org, and they found nothing but MDMA.<br /><br />Please let us know if this clarifies the matter.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />SpookDrFeelgood
