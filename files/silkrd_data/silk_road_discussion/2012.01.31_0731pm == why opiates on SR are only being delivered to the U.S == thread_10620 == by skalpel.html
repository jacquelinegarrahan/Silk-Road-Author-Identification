				I read in Pharmville&#039;s profile that they are working on getting a partnership going with someone in Europe. So keep a look out for that. I think they just got a Canadian partner setup.

				Pharmaceuticals are usually easier to detect by customs and a lot of countries have an aggressive stance against their illegal import. For example, in aus if a small amount of weed/coke/mdma/etc gets seized they may just send you a letter telling you it&#039;s been destroyed. However if they pick up your benzos/opis/adderal the letter is different. In this case, you get a warning and if you try it again, they involve the federal police.

				The simple answer is most of the demand for opiates is in the US, because whenever you go to a doctor for anything they pull out the pad and try to force Oxy/Valium and whatever drugs down your throat because the more drugs they prescribe, the more off the record bonuses they get from pharma reps. It&#039;s also high demand because pharma I don&#039;t think comes up on drug employment tests unlike smoking a pinner joint a month ago that may show up.<br /><br />Where in the EU do you live generally? There are plenty of shippers out of Germany<br /><br /><br />

				it&#039;s the same situation with trying to get Mandrax (methylqualone) shipped here to the US. Most of the good stuff is bought up locally so no real reason for a vendor to wait longer on an international order to clear escrow.
