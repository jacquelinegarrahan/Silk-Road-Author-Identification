				I&#039;m not sure this is the greatest idea. Even if you had built up a solid rep how would anyone know the new owner isn&#039;t a scammer?<br />There would just be too many unanswered questions that would prevent me from doing any kind of business with an account acquired like that.

				Interesting idea.&nbsp; I would like to sell my vendor&#039;s account because I want to start a new one under new ip addresses and implement pgp.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if customers would like the idea, though.&nbsp; I could probably get around $500 for my vendor&#039;s account, but how would we screen against scammers?

Impossible, no.&nbsp; No need to get into it, point being that in an ongoing effort to prevent scams this would seem to enable them. <br />Yes, I see you don&#039;t care. You paid $100. But what exactly did you do wrong with your account that you weren&#039;t able to recoup the initial investment?<br />&nbsp;If it is an unsuccessful account then I guess the rep would speak for itself, even in the event of a hidden transfer.<br />If the account was a success though, the cost of the account should have easily been made up over time in sales.<br />I understand where you&#039;re coming from, you bought it, it has value, you should be able to cash in on that if you wish.<br />I just think if not handled properly it can lead to some really bad business on SR.<br />
