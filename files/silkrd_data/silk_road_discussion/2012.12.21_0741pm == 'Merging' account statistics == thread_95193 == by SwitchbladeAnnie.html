				I was wondering if was possible to &#039;merge&#039; buying statistics between two accounts. I have an old account that I lost the pin to and I really don&#039;t want the whole &#039;less than 10 buys FE&#039; bollocks all over again.<br /><br />Also, this is a throwaway forum account so I won&#039;t be responding to any replies because I can&#039;t remember the password to log back in again.<br /><br />Thanks in advance : )<br /><br />

				Nope, unfortunately you cannot merge buyer statistics between two accounts. But you don&#039;t really need to merge them as you can just reset your pin. If I&#039;m not mistaking, all you have to do is keep entering random pin codes and eventually you will get a message from SR in your inbox. It will tell you the instructions needed to reset(I think you just have to wait a certain amount of time).<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Edit: For clarity.

They&#039;d get half as many of these or less if everyone understood the reset process a little better.<br />1. Enter 5 incorrect PINs to lock it. At this point an automated message will be sent to you by Support, notifying you to reply &quot;in 7 days,&quot; meaning after at least 7 days, to have your PIN finally reset. This message is no longer correct, it&#039;s 3 days.<br />2. Wait 3 days. Not 2 days, not 1 day, and certainly not 5 minutes. Feel free to wait 5, 14, or 30 days, just make sure it&#039;s 3+.<br />3. Reply and wait for new message telling you to log out and in.<br />4. Log in and set new PIN.<br /><br />Why does Support make you wait 3 days to have your PIN reset? It&#039;s in case your account has been compromised, and someone else is attempting to empty your wallet. Assuming any identifying information may be compromised with your account, the one thing Support can do is give you some time to find out that someone else locked your PIN and message them that it wasn&#039;t you, before they can take your money.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />- grahamgreene
