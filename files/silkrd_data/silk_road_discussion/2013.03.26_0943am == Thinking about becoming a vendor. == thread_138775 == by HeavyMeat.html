				Well, I don&#039;t see a whole lot of threads from prospective sellers, so I thought I&#039;d make one. I have access to a few Xanax prescriptions, though, they&#039;re not those nice 2 mg bars (0.5mg and 1mg, but I I&#039;m confident I can transition one to 2mg.) I suppose powder is an option as well? (Sounds messy.) I also have access to prescription Vyvanes (A cousin of Adderall.) I would probably not sell outside the U.S. for concerns about customs. I&#039;m also assuming that there&#039;d be enough demand for these two products (I feel pretty safe in that assumption, though.) My question is, so that I can try to weigh risk vs reward, could this be somewhat lucrative for me? I could probably get this out into the street, but I feel as if that&#039;s even riskier than SR and I figure I wouldn&#039;t make as much, either. I would of course be sure to do plenty of research as far as shipping goes, I would not take this lightly. Obviously, this is pretty small time and I&#039;m not looking to get rich, but just wanting to get some extra spending monies. Thoughts, comments, and/or concerns?<br /><br />Just about any feedback would be highly welcomed and appreciated.

				Well, what prices would you sell at? You already have competitors, do we have a reason do go to you?<br /><br />Also, can you get your hands on Activis brand syrup?

				I&#039;d be competing against the smaller dealers. I&#039;ll start at cost, if needed, to get established. I don&#039;t want to step on anyone&#039;s toes, but I doubt I would even register as a blip on some of the larger dealer&#039;s radars. The majority of people are willing to pay more for a well-established vendor that they can trust, so I&#039;ll have to be aiming for the bargain dealers who are willing to take a risk from a fresh dealer. I&#039;ll definitely be getting my game up to snuff before I start selling, because even the thriftiest of buyers still want top of the line customer service, reliability, and a discrete delivery. So, to answer your second question, great prices and hopefully excellent reviews right off the bat.<br /><br />A large portion of what I&#039;m trying to achieve here is get a feel for what people might be looking for in a new vendor.<br /><br />As to getting my hands on Activis, no go.
