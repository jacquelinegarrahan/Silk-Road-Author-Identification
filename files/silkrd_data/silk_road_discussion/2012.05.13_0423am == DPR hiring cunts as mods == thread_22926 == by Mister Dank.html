				Making Limetless a mod? You might as well hang a big neon sign over SR that reads &quot;COP LIMETED HANGOUT&quot;<br /><br />Limetless is a fuckhole who started trolling me when I said there were cops buying from vendors and trashing thier feedback - he&#039;s LE all day. Now he&#039;s helping to derail my vendor thread. I clearly stated that I only wanted those that have bought from me posting to the thread, but Limetless trolled it anyway. So DPR is making trolls the mods. The fact DPR made him a mod seriously calls into question what this site is about and who exactly is running it.<br /><br /><br />

				Actually, you started being a prick to me when I saw one of your paranoid statements and told you that you needed to get off the crack which was about 2 or so months ago. Since then you decided to throw out the &quot;LE&quot; thing at me so I just rip the piss out of you right back. <br /><br />My response on your thread was justified, I got the report that you made about Uniwiz&#039;s comment but it&#039;s not the job of any Mod to remove someone who is making constructive criticism about you. Unless you are going to be one of these people where you talk about freedom of speech apart from when someone insults you that is? Feel free to be a hypocrite though by all means. <br /><br />And I didn&#039;t troll you actually, all I said was that I wouldn&#039;t remove it so don&#039;t lie. <br /><br />It&#039;s always one rule for you and a different rule for everyone else Dank. I&#039;m guessing that whilst you would like my post saying I wouldn&#039;t remove my comment gone and see that as just, you would consider it absolutely abhorrent and part of a conspiracy that any of your posts flaming me or anyone that you have taken it upon yourself to be such a massive fuck-face too since you have been here to be removed or edited? Weird that huh. Ohhh yeah, I forgot that you God&#039;s gift to this place so the same rules don&#039;t apply. My bad. <br /><br />Oh and as well you state that you don&#039;t like the way SR is run over and over god knows how many times...but you are still here? Nobody is forcing you to be here. You are a bit like a junky that has hit rock bottom in that respect, you hate this place so much but you continue to use it. <br /><br />The Mods aren&#039;t here to serve you and do remove/delete/move whatever thread or post that doesn&#039;t meet your personal standard son. Not how it works. Just like I wont delete this thread even though you piss me the fuck off, isn&#039;t how it works. <br /><br />Anyway that&#039;s all I&#039;ve got to say on the issue. If you have anything else you&#039;d like to say maybe it&#039;s time you grew some balls and PM&#039;d me so we can discuss it like adults rather than you making a public spectical of yourself as-per-the-norm.
