				I really hope this thread can be stickied.<br /><br />Members can post in this thread whenever there is a downtime (to notify everyone) and DRP, admins and mods may post here the time and length of the latest downtime, or the reason of the downtime (hack attack, maintenance, etc).<br /><br />If possible, please post all Silk Road downtime problems here and refrain from starting multiple threads. Thanks every member of the Road here for active participation!

				Last time the site was out, price of BTC&#039;s went down &#039;round 10% or so, then when site came back, so did the price of coinage...and it&#039;s gone even higher still in the last week.<br /><br />Anyone with that kind of knowledge, or the know-how and resources to track such things, notice any big buys and big sells that were in synch with the site&#039;s down and back times?&nbsp; <br /><br />Could be a nefarious, Dr. Evil-like attack.<br />

				Just my fucking luck that every single time I go to the bank to buy bitcoins I come back and SR is down. I was literally at my account&#039;s checkout page when I left, came back 10 minutes later after purchase and I get a 404. So now I&#039;m forced to squat on over $200 worth of BTC and hope the price of coins doesn&#039;t fuck up my order by the time we&#039;re live again. This is the second time this has happened :(
