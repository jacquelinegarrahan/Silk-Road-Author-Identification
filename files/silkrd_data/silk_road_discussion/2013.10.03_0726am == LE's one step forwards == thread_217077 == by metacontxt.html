				If things are as they seem (and there&#039;s always the possibility they aren&#039;t) then this is a major scalp for LE*. No point pretending otherwise. I read someone on here mocking the cops about how they&#039;d spent many thousands of hours and many millions of dollars catching one guy with no stash and &#039;only&#039; $3.5 million in BTC. Seriously? SR was big and bad enough that it attracted Congressional attention. DPR (or whoever that was) could have been caught with 5 cents on him; it wouldn&#039;t have mattered. SR started to really piss off LE&#039;s paymasters, LE took it down, LE earnt their keep bigtime with this bust. This is a backwards step for those keen to see an end to the imbecilic War On Drugs. The message several idiot politicians are going to take home from SR&#039;s demise is that the War On Drugs is winnable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Which, of course, it isn&#039;t. LE busted Al Capone. The 21st Amendment came along anyway. Whether in the short term, as buyers and sellers simply shift to a new market; or the longer term, when 3D printing technology will be able to produce pretty much whatever chemical compound you want it to - LE are not going to be able to achieve their objectives. They won this battle, but they&#039;re fighting a war they&#039;ll never be able to win. This is the one step forwards that accompanies their two steps backwards. Their failure is inevitable, but unfortunately for us all their victories along the way pushes their capitulation ever further into the distance.<br /><br />*Great work, guys! Have a few beers after work tonight - enjoy your victory with a few doses of a legal intoxicant. Some of you might have a few too many and do something terrible like beat up your spouse or run someone over on the way home from the bar. Hang on, nah that never happens. Only deadbeats off their faces on narcotics do shit like that.

				We can only hope that some sort of multiversal karma will catch up to everyone involved in this bust and each and everyone one of them will drop dead tonight. I wish there was a god out there capable of doing that. These people are scum. SR represents the most reasonable and reasonable drug users. People who are doing it safely and respecting other people. People who aren&#039;t violating ANYONEs rights. Good and innocent people with the exception of the occasional scammer. <br /><br />They&#039;ll get theirs. I hope I&#039;m president one day or in congress. I hope their department goes down in flames when prohibition is over and they lose all their jobs and retirement. Government can&#039;t come up with a budget right now? How about this? DEFUND THE DEA.
