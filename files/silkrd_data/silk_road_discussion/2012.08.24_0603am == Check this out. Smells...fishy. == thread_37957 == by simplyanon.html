				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/e2eb518d2d<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking either A - Giving himself feedback why? I do not know, he seems to be a decent vendor, but as there is mention of #4 (heroin, I&#039;m assuming), and this listing has naught to do with heroin, I am curious. <br /><br />Or B - There is a legit reason for this and I am a condescending douchebag of the highest order.

				WTF? I don&#039;t understand the listing. Is he selling a horse cause there is firstly no cost listed and secondly, the only mention of a potential drug (#4 Heroin) is in the customer feedback section at the bottom of the page. Am I missing something here? ???

				The horse looks good.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; And I like the price 0.00. I think Im going to trade for it. I saw it on the internet. It must be true. THEN I&#039;m going to get all f*ed up on #4 h and go crazy. Look for me in the paper and news.&nbsp; ::)

				Well he also sells actual listings for #4 (and a fair amount of other drugs) and his name is Northern Dancer, so I&#039;m assuming he gave out a free sample or something of the kind over the forums or something, and then created that BS listing for 0.00 so that the people who had gotten something from him could go there and leave him feedback for whatever service he provided. The horse and description is just his namesake, and although it&#039;s honestly a bit odd, he appears to be a totally legit vendor.

				Northern Dancer is a fairly new vendor from Canada. He sells Coke, #4 H and ICE (Speed) pills.<br />He sent out some samples to get things going, and I do believe he used this listing for the feedback.<br />I guess it&#039;s just a bit of back story to his name, and to add some colour to the whole thing.<br />I can see why someone, who just happened to stumble across this, would think this listing looks a bit &#039;fishy&#039; though.
