				I&#039;m a first time buyer and bought a product that was up and avalible.. the product is now not available and on the venders page is say If u have a pending order they have enough to put the order through. But this vender will not respond at all. And my order for the past 2days still says processing. Does it take a week to process?.. I kinda just want to cancellation but its a reputable vender. Any help/advice?..

				try to have a little patience and just give the vendor a chance to get to your order, they might be a little behind or only ship a few times a week.<br /><br />you will be able to cancel if its still processing after waiting 4 days i believe

				Right. less then 4 days? or a week?<br /><br />If you do not have a cancel button then it has been less then 4 days. You do not get a cancel button until after 4 days for just such reasons. No buyers remorse.<br />

				Thanks.. I just wanted to get in touch with the vender because I assumed he would ship on the same day as order place(as it says on his page) they actually got back in touch which was key for me. I am away from my house alot and would hate to have missed it. The vender informed me they have shipping days.. I just wish they would have posted it on their page so that I would have known. Otherwise I would have bought from someone else.. but thanks for the help. Not tring to b frowned upon for asking questions. But I have a few hundred tied up soooo I&#039;m going to ask!

				My purchase is going to be canceled by the vendor, because he didnt have enough product, he messaged me and let me know, does this mean im going to loose 4% BTC as mentioned above even if the vendor cancels?&nbsp; I do wish he would speed it up, if they told me they where gonna cancel, why not do it right then, now im stuck with no money, and no BTC, and will be out of time ...fuuuuuuuh :&#039;(

				i believe if the order was hedged then the buyer will lose that fee when an order is canceled and you will get the value back minus the fee, if it wasnt hedged then you should just get the same number of coins back <br /><br />i dont think it matters whether it was marked in transit or not - maybe i wrong, shroom can you provide where you saw that theres a difference between before and after its marked in transit?

I have only ever had to cancel very few orders. When I first started out I canceled an order that was marked in transit and the buyer lost a bit of coin. I gave it back to them out of my pocket and all that, but I just assumed he lost it because I marked it in transit.<br /><br />So if a buyer places an order and the item is Hedged and I cancel it because I dont like their buyers stats or whatever.....they will lose 4%?<br /><br />Is that right? Trying to understand it myself now.

				Yes I have read that before. I still thought I was on the right track with what I said earlier.<br /><br />Either way. I edited my above post to reflect there is a good chance I didn&#039;t know WTF I was talking about. ;)<br /><br />Thanks!<br />
