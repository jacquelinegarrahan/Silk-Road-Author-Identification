				I have an extensive spotless record as a buyer on Silk Road.<br /><br />I suspected I was making a mistake when I did this, but at the time there were no other domestic methadone vendors with stock, so I figured &quot;what the heck? everyone&#039;s gotta get started sometime.&quot; At least, there were no negative reports.<br /><br />On 4/18, I ordered from the vendor TheSource, specifying USPS Priority shipping. Less than 24 hours later the order was marked as &quot;In Transit&quot;. Nothing has shown up. I know it&#039;s been &quot;only&quot; a week, but Priority shipments to my address (major East Coast city) almost always arrive in two days, sometimes three.The profile page for TheSource says he was last seen &quot;7 days ago&quot;. I&#039;ve sent him multiple messages, but obviously since he&#039;s not online, they remain unread. To make matters worse, as far as I can tell, TheSource has never completed an order. There is no feedback from finalized transactions on his profile page. It says he has 100% positive feedback, but there&#039;s no transaction count.<br /><br />All this information strongly suggests that I have almost no chance of receiving my order. I&#039;ve written to SR support, but I&#039;m sure they are swamped at the moment. Thing is, I could really use those tied up bitcoins. WTF? Why do people do shit like this? Up until now I&#039;ve had perfect luck on SR with many many transactions. Sure there was the occasional minor quality issue, but for the most part, vendors have gone out of their way to make things right when minor hiccups occurred.<br /><br />Any suggestions on how to proceed? Anyone else out there stupid enough to have also ordered from TheSource?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />-- Scratch<br />

But I can&#039;t dispuite it for another three days, and then who knows how long it&#039;ll take to reach a resolution? Bottom line is my money is tied up for probably two weeks when its painfully apparent that the vendor lied about shipping the product. If he hadn&#039;t, I&#039;d be able to cancel the order now. This is one area where vendors clearly have the upper hand. All they have to do is mark the order in transit and suddenly the customer&#039;s hands are tied. This is especially frustrating when this vendor has seemingly abandoned their account. Add in the volatility of the value of the currency used here and you get a fucked up situation.<br /><br />There really should be more stringent requirements on new vendors until they have established some credibility by actually shipping a few orders. Dicks like TheSource give them a bad name.<br /><br />Also, why is it possible for vendors to cancel orders that are &quot;In Transit&quot;? This makes no sense. If it&#039;s In Transit then presumably, it is out of the vendor&#039;s hands, correct?<br /><br />-- Scratch<br />
