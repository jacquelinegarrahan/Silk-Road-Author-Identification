				I have for the last two days tried to close a deal with two vendors.&nbsp; One had shipping options avail. (I chose one) and one had no options available to chose from.&nbsp; I tried both individually and together with the same result.&nbsp; I tried to purchase from both sources and I received an error message stating &quot;you must select postage first&quot; or something to that effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;Anyone else?<br /><br />PK

				I would, if I could get on the fucking site.<br /><br />I&#039;ve pissed around with my own listings using a purchasing account, and you have to select a postage, and THEN press the &#039;Go&#039; button underneath it. (I have &#039;Free&#039; regular shipping set up as a postage option, NOT the SR default &#039;domestic - free&#039; option as I&#039;m in the UK so that confused folks, as well as priority options.)<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely not very intuitive.<br /><br />I have no idea about items with no postage charges at all - perhaps do like I did, and create a &#039;Free worldwide airmail - ($0)&#039; option so folks have something to select - and then press go!<br /><br />If SR comes around for me in the next hour or so and nobody else jumps up, I&#039;ll try and place an order on your account and see what happens.

				Yep, I go to finish the purchase and it when I click the &quot;place order&quot; button it just reloads the cart page and doesn&#039;t put it in orders. ..AND YES, I tried Ctl+f5
