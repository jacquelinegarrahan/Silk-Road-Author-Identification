				We&#039;ve had some withdrawal issues over the past few days.&nbsp; Right now, they are delayed up to 5 hours.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been working to expand our capacity to process withdrawals without compromising their anonymity or the security/anonymity of our servers.&nbsp; I believe we have a good solution that will help us get up to speed, but it will delay things a little more as we deploy.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep you all posted via this thread.<br /><br />If any of your withdrawals have gone missing in the past few days, please just message support with the amount and time of the withdrawal and the address.<br /><br />-DPR

				ok, were on the new system now.&nbsp; Withdrawals are being processed about 10x faster, and we should be able to scale out another 10x w/o much trouble if need be.&nbsp; There are a few more things to put into place to make sure this runs smoothly, but all looks good.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience.

				I have only been here a short time but recently it seems many members have been lamenting a lack of oversight and absent moderators, however your recent address of some issues have been done very swiftly compared to some other issues (like the ten days of downtime) and are very much appreciated and duly noted. Take care DPR/company I wish you all the best as I am starting to fully realize the mark on technology and society that SR has made. Stay safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				How does this withdrawal delay affect auto-withdraw?&nbsp; I have auto-withdraw enabled but on finalizing the BTC just sit in my account on SR.&nbsp; Do I need to initiate a withdrawal or is it already in process and the BTC will leave my account once it is complete?<br /><br />It seems that the auto-withdrawal might not be initiated as I could spend or send the BTC p2p while waiting.
