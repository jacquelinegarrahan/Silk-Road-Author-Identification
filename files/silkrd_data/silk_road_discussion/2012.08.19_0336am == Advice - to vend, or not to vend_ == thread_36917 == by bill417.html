				Hi guys. <br /><br />Basically, I&#039;m sick of it. <br /><br />Sick of seeing finalise early. <br />Sick of scammers. <br />Sick of over-inflated prices.<br />Sick of poor-quality product. <br /><br />I can&#039;t help but think how much a &#039;decent&#039; businessman is what people would like on the Road, and yet, for me personally as a Cannabis customer of the UK, I haven&#039;t found a totally reliable cannabis vendor. <br /><br />SO, I&#039;d be looking at selling strains myself, probably only domestically. But, should I go into this line of business? Because at the moment, I simply buy it in (normally 2oz pm) and smoke that to myself. With customers in consideration, this amount would probably need to be tripled or more esp so after initial sales pick-up. And remember, it&#039;s bought in. Often they&#039;re top-line products from West Coast US or Canada, and I&#039;ll usually always try to get at least one Sativa and one Indica. <br />But then there&#039;s the possibility of GYO (grow-your-own). I&#039;ve not actually ventured into this myself, but know the ropes etc. Obviously this carries an increased work-load than simply &#039;bagging it up&#039; so to speak. <br /><br />I&#039;d probably have some simple rules-<br /><br />1) Never finalise early, ever, ever, ever. It&#039;s there for a reason. Funds may always be required in order to order more, but if that&#039;s the case I&#039;d go into hiding like a stealth-beast until finances were sorted. <br />2) Domestic only. Sure, I&#039;ve been mailing things around for years, but for drugs (that are illegal) to which I&#039;d give a (fake) returns address, I&#039;d probably pass on intl orders until I had an absolutely fool-proof system I could satisfy myself using. <br />3) Specific shipping days. Of course, from opening I don&#039;t expect to &#039;feed the 5,000&#039;, but I think if we had Tue/ Thurs/ Sat/ Sun for Order enquiries, processing, picture-taking, whatever admin work etc, with Mon/ Wed/ Fri for shipping product out. Communication is key for me as a buyer, so obviously a priority if I want to make any money. <br />4) Prices. Think I&#039;d be looking at around £10 for 1g - which wouldn&#039;t really give me much % profit, and works better in favour of the customer. That&#039;d also be £30-35 for 1/8, which (in my personal opinion), for stuff that isn&#039;t &quot;street-grade&quot; (don&#039;t know what you&#039;re getting 70% of the time) it&#039;s a good price. <br />5) Customer service. If you&#039;ve found better prices, elsewhere, and you want to negotiate, use the other guy is the likely answer. However, I would always ensure customers were totally satisfied before sending any money over, and offer a discount scheme for returning customers.<br />Eg, 5 + Transactions with me = 5% off all future transactions; 10+ transactions = 10% off. The only prerequisite to this would be 5/5 ratings, so obviously I&#039;d do my best.<br /><br />And to quote Sean Connery in The Rock, &#039;Losers always complain about &quot;their best&quot;. Winners go home and fu** the prom queen!&#039; <br /><br />...<br /><br />So, hopefully, with a bit of luck, I&#039;ll be having plenty of sex with the missus&#039;!

				Don&#039;t do it! More money for me!<br /><br />Kidding. If you have what it takes then go ahead. Just be prepared. Good luck!
