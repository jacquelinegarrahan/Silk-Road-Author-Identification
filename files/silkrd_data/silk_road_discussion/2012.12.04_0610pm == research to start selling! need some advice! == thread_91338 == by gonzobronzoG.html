				Maybe some of you Guys would be so nice and help me with some experience or advice!<br /><br />Me:<br />Im using SR for a while to sort some items as buyer since some weeks I really interested to become a seller!<br />I hope to start with selling at the beginning of next year if I have all infos and all researches are done!<br />I want to sell some quality xtc pills (Ive done this for year&#039;s &quot;the oldschool way&quot;)&nbsp;in &nbsp;germany (first domestic-only/small startup listings) and let it grow if I find a nice way to work with!<br /><br />So, here my Top 10. wanted to know :<br /><br />1. Thats my plan to start with some listings! Do you thing it is enought to start with a sample listing(15x availability) and a small listing(20x availability)?<br /><br />2. online-wallet/offline-wallet/direct trader-deposit ? or maybe some different wallets? whats your chooise? (at the past I used BlogChain wallet)<br /><br />3. Can I simply set availability by creating a new listing or have I to stop it by myself &nbsp;if its out of stock?<br /><br />4. Is 10% SR fee and around 6% esrow fee right?<br /><br />5.What for refund possibility are you &nbsp;offering to buyers? (how often(ca.) you have given refund? since you start selling?)<br /><br />6.In my country it gives a possibility to send registred(trackable) mail to postbox without any need of signing for the recipient and Im thinking about an use of this as 2.(special)posting option especially with the possibility of refund (even so I would not give the tracker to the buyer (because of safety reason)but rather use it as safety-proof that the package did not arrives(and needed to refund) or someone tryed to fool !)<br />what you thing about it?<br /><br />7. Auto-withdraw to the same wallet with different adresse?or to different wallets?<br /><br />8. How often do you change the auto-withdraw adress?<br /><br />9. I like the roads massanger and would use it for simply all communication! but should I leave my mail adress at the info text to go on if SR has a downtime? maybe there are too much guys wich are try to contact directly by mail?<br />(what happens if SR shut down any time and no one of your customers has any ideer to get back to you? maybe providing the email could help to go on!)<br /><br />10. Would you provide some posting-days(maybe Mo./direct after weekend and Thu./for orders wich needed for the weekend) or everyday posting? and how it looks with processing-time? (mybe it would be an option because I have somedays really long to work!or only: so fast as possible)<br /><br />thx for replys &amp; best regards!<br />Gonzo.
