				I&#039;m no chemist. But I love mdma. Particularly the come-up + euphoria.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read some reports on Methylone, but tbh I&#039;m still none the wiser.<br /><br />Has anyone here tried both Methylone and MDMA, but *not* combined?&nbsp; <br /><br />How does the come-up and/or euphoric rush compare?&nbsp; <br /><br />I see that Methylone is pretty much half the price of MDMA crystal, so the common sense part of me suggests it probably isn&#039;t quite as tasty as mdma.<br />Could be wrong. (quite often happens, lol).<br /><br /><br />Any thoughts?

				Fuck RC&#039;s.<br /><br />Android...Senior member in one month? lol<br /><br />But yeah MDMA is far better. Methylone is just too weak and doesn&#039;t scratch the itch like good old MDMA does.

				In my area it was flooded with methylone until Mandy kicked it to the fucking curb, the way it should be.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;m biased against it from all the vendors selling Mdma as methylone.

				Methylone is very much underrated imo.&nbsp; You have to dose higher than MDMA, yes, but the effects are quite similar.&nbsp; It has a strong come up, lots of euphoria, lots of chatting, lots of hugging, closest substance to MDMA you will find.&nbsp; There are rumors about Methylone being sold as MDMA, this is, however, extremely uncommon.&nbsp; If someone wanted to rip people off, they would not put a substance in which is worth nearly as much as MDMA in value.&nbsp; If you got sold a Methylone pill, it would not be easy to distinguish from E.&nbsp; Are you sure you were sold Methylone?&nbsp; Did you test it with a Marquis reagent?&nbsp; One night I did Methylone with 20 other people, and we all had a fantastic time.&nbsp; All of us loved it.&nbsp; Quite a few people even said they preferred it to MDMA, because they said the euphoria was the same, but the crash was lighter.&nbsp; About an equal number of people said they preferred MDMA, and the rest said they couldn&#039;t tell the difference.<br /><br />I have done them both together before, and they mix quite well.&nbsp; One of the best mixes is 2:1 Methylone to Mephedrone, but recently Meph has become overly popular and has been given a pretty bad rep.

				The first rolls i bought were the Chicago mint. A particular &quot;Blue blank&quot; that I got during the fall/winter of 2010 was speculated to be a mix of mdma/mda/?speed? Wonderful pills. I&#039;ve&nbsp; never dosed less than two plus one half booster of the mint press but I always thought they were incredible rolls. They still seem to be in production according to pillreports.com

				I love Methylone and I love MDMA<br />I would not compare both but treat them as separate substances<br />MDMA is great for when you want MDMA<br />but Methylone is great if youre with your loved one or with some really close friends<br />I find that it really lets you open up and everything is very clear. <br />I have a lot of friends who say that they like Methylone a lot better than E pills going around<br />I always have great rushes and everything feels great and soft on Methylone<br />Methylone + N2O is great<br />+ weed is also great<br />+ synthetic cannabinoids the high is just fucking fantastic<br />+ Mephedrone its fun but messy<br />+ shrooms = got crazy visuals and great body rushes. I believe it intensifies shroom trips to the point that visuals seemed very DMT like.<br />next for me to try is Methylone + 2C-I<br />Btw, my Methylone dosages range from 180-220mg <br />Make sure its the crystal also not the powder. Huge difference. I have tried both and I find the crystals to be one of the best things ever.<br />Its also great to chill with some shisha or to take it and go to the sauna or jacuzzi or what. lol<br />What can I say? I&#039;m a fan.
