				Title: <strong>[SOLVED] Where these really Psilocybin capsules?</strong><br />

				A while ago I got some capsules from a friend. They were described as Psilocybin capsules. They had a small amount of brown powder in them. The powder tasted terrrible, as drugs should. Like a sharp earwax. The capsules were 500mg but were only about 1/10 full. I bought 4 of them.<br /><br />I had never tried mushrooms. I took one and another friend of mine took one and we had a really good time. I barely had any visuals but I felt euphoric and we laughed a lot. My friend said he was getting visuals. So I had two capsules left after the first time taking them. I had them stored in a little container at room temperature out of light. They sat there for a good few months. One day, I took them out and the powder inside had started to turn into a sticky goop. It had also darkened in color. I didn&#039;t know if they were still good so I tried just a tiny bit of it. I had no ill effects so my friend and I took them and had the same experience as the first time.<br /><br />So my question is this, what was in those capsules? Was it ground up muchrooms? The dose was tiny, but still had some effects. Gimme your knowledge, please.<br />

				Sounds like it was 4-aco-dmt mixed with some sort of mushroom powder. 4-aco-dmt turns into a blackish goop after awhile if improperly stored. It&#039;s hygroscopic.

				Yep. After looking at pictures, that&#039;s exactly what it looked like. Thanks a bunch.

				I might have encountered the exact same thing from a vendor here awhile back. Some really cheap mushroom capsules that weren&#039;t very potent. I think each one must have been laced with a small amount of 4-aco-dmt. (2-3mg) so you take 7-8 and you get a proper 4-aco trip. <br /><br />So you take some shroom powder, or maybe just a similar legal mushroom powdered, then add in some 4-aco or any other 4-ho series and bam, instant profit. It makes perfect sense because I&#039;ll tell you right now dosing out 20mg of that stuff in a cap otherwise is damn near impossible.<br /><br />I think this seller is still around too. Not on my re-order list definitely unless you&#039;re messing around with an established vendor in the field like Shroomeister.

				Sadly, the only domestic supplier I can find for shrooms is selling &quot;powdered&quot;. Not exactly enticing but was prepared to give it a go. After reading this thread I&#039;m no longer sure. Is there any point?

				4-aco is pretty rare. I haven&#039;t seen it really sold domestically for awhile. But it&#039;s actually a pretty good artificial psilocybin analogue.
