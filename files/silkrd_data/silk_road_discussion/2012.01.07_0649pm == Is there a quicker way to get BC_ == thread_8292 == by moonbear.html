				Whats the easiest and most economical way to acquire bitcoins using a credit card? Using money orders, it takes 2 weeks to do everything needed just to get some bud, and I want to be able to purchase bitcoins in minutes, without paying some ridiculous fee.

				Get-Bitcoin.com, using a cash deposit at the bank takes 24 hours or less, as far as I&#039;ve heard.

				VirWoX. It&#039;s not really economical but it&#039;s fast. Once your account is verified through Second Life, you can depost USD. Then exchange USD to SLL, then SLL to BTC, then withdraw to your SR address. You can place market orders if you need it fast, but limit orders make sure that you get the best conversion rate at the time. Sometimes it can take a couple of hours to fill a limit order, sometimes it takes less than an hour.<br /><br />Only think that sucks is that when you have a new account you can only deposit ~90 USD, and it can take up to 48 hours for the Bitcoins to be withdrawn. But once you have invested $400+ you can deposit up to $700 USD and they seem to process your withdrawals a lot faster! I withdrew 40BTC the other day and it was pretty much instantaneous. SR takes a little while to show the funds in your account though.

				I lend out bitcoins, which can be done within 15 minutes.&nbsp; My interest rates are also quite competitive.&nbsp; My listing is under money-loans.<br /><br />badboy

				Dwolla.com is now introducing instant access to your funds at a connected/linked bank account. You will not have to wait 5 days for the transfer to happen. So going from dollars in your checking account to bitcoins would be pretty fast.<br /><br />rusty

				I know I&#039;m gonna get pissed on for suggesting this... but I&#039;ve used a vendor from eBay for easy PayPal to BTC transactions straight to my SR wallet. Haven&#039;t had any problems.&nbsp; PM me if you want his UN. <br /><br />I realize it&#039;s not the most secure way to go about it (anonymity wise), but if you find someone you can trust I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s anything to worry about.<br /><br />Guy charges lowest prices I&#039;ve seen. At least for this &quot;kind&quot; of purchase ;)<br /><br />CURRENT RATE (X) AMT OF BTC (/)1.5-2%
