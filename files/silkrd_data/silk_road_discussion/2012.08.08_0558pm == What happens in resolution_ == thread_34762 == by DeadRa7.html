				Greetings-<br />Long story short, I&#039;ve got a pending order that I&#039;ve got a gut feeling isn&#039;t going to show due to various factors regarding this particular vendor&#039;s behavior lately-poor shipping, many 1-2/5 feedback, not responding to messages, took down all listings ect. This particular order is valued at over 1,200 USD, and being as I&#039;m not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination I really cannot afford to lose this money.&nbsp; (inb4 don&#039;t spend money here you can&#039;t afford to lose on here, yeah yeah yeah whatever)<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve had two failed deliveries when I first joined which were the two and only times I will ever F.E.&nbsp; Besides that, all purchases have gone very smoothly.&nbsp; My purchasing stats are as follows:<br /><br />Total transactions: 13<br />Total spent: $224x.xx<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 5 months<br /><br />IF I were to be refunded due to a failed delivery, since literally this order is about a third of all the $ I&#039;ve spent on here, it would make my refund rate skyrocket and vendors would no longer want to do business with me?&nbsp; I&#039;m honestly not worried about that as much as losing 12 hundo, especially since half of it isn&#039;t mine. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m jumping the gun, I fuckin hope to hell that it still comes-We&#039;re turning this 1,200 into 4500k and am much more interested in product than refund, but as a last resort I&#039;d like to know what I&#039;d be getting myself into with the resolution center.&nbsp; <br /><br />This fucking sucks :(

				Basically if the vendor doesn&#039;t respond to your messages and gets alot of 1s and 2s then you&#039;ll most<br />Likely get a 100% refund which doesn&#039;t appear in the refund rate. Cheers mate<br /><br />*from my experience.

				No no no no no! This is not what happens. If you resolve it you have to take a polygraph and then if you fail then the VDS (Vendor Death Squad) kick your doors in and we do a bit of wet-work. That&#039;s what the Vendor forum is all about you see, it&#039;s where we discuss who&#039;s gunna get shot next and who&#039;s gunna do it. :P
