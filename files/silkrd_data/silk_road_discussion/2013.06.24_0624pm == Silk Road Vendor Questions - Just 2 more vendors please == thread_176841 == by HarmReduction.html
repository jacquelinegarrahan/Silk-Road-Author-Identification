				I just skimmed through the other thread. You mentioned several times that some people took your survey without identifying information. Given the number of trolls on this forum, how do you know they were all vendors? How do you know they were different people? 10 of your 28 respondents could be one person trolling you with different accounts and making up whatever answers he wants. I don&#039;t see how you can draw any firm conclusions from this research.<br />

				Harm Reduction, so why do you want to know the inns and out&#039;s of a cats bottom again?&nbsp; I respect you as a journo, if that&#039;s&nbsp; what you are. But your questions read like a list of an agency trying to log everything and build up a picture. You say there are vendors informing ( to you) on a regular basis, I hope I haven&#039;t purchased of them. Now if your intentions are to help people, how can you do that when they are anonymous? What is the purpose of such intelligence gathering. I do realize if you were an enemy of SR, then surely you wouldn&#039;t go about it in such a blatent manner. Is this study going to be published then, if so when? Ok you have already published, but does that make your intentions admirable? And what harm did you reduce by this previous study?<br /><br />So My gender, my age, am I employed, my reason for coming here.My purchase history. Did I deal drugs before I came to SR. What drugs were they. What drugs do I sell now.Describe the process of becoming a vendor. Where do I dispatch (send) my&nbsp; products to. are you joking? Any one of them questions on their own would raise suspicions. Coupled together, they are red flags of biblical proportions. No vendor has the right to give customers info, away anon or not. And they should really tell you to mind your own business. You could easily narrow down the field, with them questions, and cause some real harm, which is what you claim to reduce. Most people haven&#039;t had no criminal experience, so you asking these questions won&#039;t alarm them. But you have to admit these results could be used for&nbsp; nefarious purposes. Convince me?

Well said.<br /><br />&nbsp;I wanted to help...then I saw the questions and more then half of them are so intrusive and literally would be giving myself up to LE. And if I was to answer them 100% honest or anyone for that matter..you would be jeopardizing yourself in a way that would not be worth it in any way,shape or form. I would not answer that questionnaire truthfully for $500k. So I believe that anyone that did...totally had to lie. So the information will not be accurate anyways. And any vendor that did answer it truthfully is a total idiot.

				surely OP you can understand why this is so suspicious to us? again i&#039;m sorry if you are just a student trying to do your assignment, but the fact that you linked to your other thread like it was some absolute proof that you couldn&#039;t possibly be LE, when it proves absolutely FA, is even more suspicious to me. sorry but that&#039;s how it is. you&#039;re not trying to question homeless street junkies here, this is people who stand to lose an awful lot if you turned out to not be who you say.

He has already passed an ethics board, which protects anonymity if he knows the identities of those he is interviewing, which he doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; <br />I understand why people are skeptical or suspicious, that&#039;s the nature of this business, but this isn&#039;t an undergrad trying to get an A, not that that can&#039;t be important.&nbsp; I think studies about SR and harm reduction can significantly alter popular perception of us and of drug use in general...
