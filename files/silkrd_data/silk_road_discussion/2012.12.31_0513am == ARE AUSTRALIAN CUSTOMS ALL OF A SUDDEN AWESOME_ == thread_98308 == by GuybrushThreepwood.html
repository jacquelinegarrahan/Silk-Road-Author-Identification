				Sent packages to several people this last month but the recipients claim to have not received their product.<br /><br />Terrible shame if they have as I would hate to lose a solid customer base, but I can not afford to Escrow their money anymore to lose %50 of my shipped orders, that I then have to refund or replace out of my own pocket making the exercise pointless.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;:(<br /><br />Aussie customs are no more &quot;awesome&quot; than usual - I think it&#039;s just this time of year. Today is a national day off for Australia Post employees only, so deliveries wont be happening again until Wed 3rd.<br /><br />I have been seeing that a lot of countries are experiencing delays - I hope that is the cause.<br /><br />I get tired of hearing the Australia Customs is super difficult to penetrate line, it&#039;s no more difficult/ same procedures/ same equipment as most custom boarder security systems.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I understand where your coming from mate, I was new once myself. However, you need to drop the hostility in your posts and look at things from a different perspective. A lot of vendors will take note of posts which are from unhappy, upset buyers. What sort of drugs are you ordering from O/S vendors and how long have you been waiting for a delivery? Have you PM&#039;d the vendor/s in question and if so, what did they say? PM me if you don&#039;t want to post here. We all had to start somewhere on here so don&#039;t think I don&#039;t know how frustrating it can be for a new buyer. However, it&#039;s not all doom and gloom out there in cyberspace. Your main problem is FE. Hopefully, if it doesn&#039;t arrive, the vendor will work with you.

				Thanks W.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I do understand now that I am coming across as hostile, and that&#039;s not my intention, having recently discovered SR and the endless beauty and potential in it, I am slightly enamored, yet annoyed that it could be killed by people not doing the research, as a n00b thats all I have been doing and I cant understand why some people give the game away by not reading the advice columns that were put there to help and protect.<br /><br />Again, I apologise if I come across as hostile, 4 days of wired research and an excitable mind.. I just want others to do the right thing and aussies to be getting o/s products and prices.<br /><br />I still have hope that my two FE&#039;d products come through, vendor stats and comments were good, but if they don&#039;t I will take you up on your offer and again, thanks.

				This happens every year, mail slows down over the Xmas period. Usually it takes around 2 weeks its more like&nbsp; a month now. Yeah Australia Post put on extra staff but the hold up is customs. Everyone orders from overseas around this time and everything has to clear customs before its released into the general mail.&nbsp; Just have to read the seller forums on Ebay to see everyone shipping to Australia is experiencing delays up to a month.&nbsp; If you order from overseas just pick you vendor wisely, don&#039;t go for the cheapest vendor as packaging is far more important than price.

With illicit drugs, in all the mainland states, if your caught with 3g&#039;s or more, it&#039;s referred to the Australian Federal Police to thoroughly investigate. Under 3 g&#039;s is classed as a&nbsp; personal amount. It depends on what a preliminary investigation by the AFP uncovers as to what the next course of action will be. What ever the case may be, Customs DO NOT send out Love Letters for illicit drugs. Tasmania is the exception to the rule in terms of quantities classified for personal use. Under 25 g&#039;s is classed as personal, yes that&#039;s 25GRAMS,&nbsp; and over 25 g&#039;s is a commercial quantity. Lucky bastards!&nbsp; :)

				Thank you for your contributions. <br /><br />It seemed odd to me that some that were sent at the same time as others arrived and we go to extra lengths to package properly so very odd.<br /><br />Since it appears that many people are in this boat it is no surprise that posts like this are being made. <br /><br />As a vendor who wants to ensure their customers can get access to their wares it is difficult to evaluate when one is being scammed or there are genuine hold ups.<br /><br />We want to help these unfortunate Australians have a safe and enjoyable time consuming our wares but it&#039;s difficult when you find a disproportionate amount of n00bs claiming they didn&#039;t receive their orders when regular customers have already taken possession of theirs.<br /><br />If n00bs are predominantly the issue, which was what we were trying to deduce, we will ban any interaction with buyers under X amount of successful transactions.<br /><br />Australia isn&#039;t much different to ship to as the United States or the UK, what makes it difficult is when you get a disproportionate amount of scammers from one location you start to wonder if they understand they will ruin it for themselves as well as their fellow citizens who are honest about their purchases and get blamed for the actions of others.<br /><br />You guys who think it&#039;s acceptable to abuse the Escrow system need to remember we are here to provide a service and it doesn&#039;t just appear in your letterboxes, we work hard and pay a premium price to bring you a premium product so when you scam us we have to start thinking about quantity restrictions etc.<br /><br />On a happier note, Guybrush hopes you all have an excellent year this year, the rEVOLution survives Dr Paul&#039;s departure and continues to grow, and we here at Silk Road continue to spread love and enlightenment through the use of liberating substances and the Free Market.<br /><br />God Bless Silk Road and the Libertarian rEVOLution&nbsp; :) ;) :D ;D 8) :-* :) ;) :D ;D 8) :-*<br /><br />

Not all (some are really trying to do the right thing), but some newbies have the attitude of trying all they can to receive drugs without having to pay for them. It&#039;s fucked that they think that&#039;s acceptable, however, perhaps raising the number of successful transactions required to a minimum number will help weed some of them out for you, hopefully! Your right in saying that Aussie Customs is no tougher to bring through contraband in the postal system than it&#039;s counterparts, the U.S and the U.K. Abusing Escrow is just not on for both buyers and vendors. Try thinking of the other party and finalizing an order which has arrived, to make them happy. I&#039;ve found if your courteous and prompt at finalizing the order, you get looked after in what you buy and receive from them. What goes around comes around and a vendor will appreciate a buyer who takes the time to promptly finalize the order once it arrives. That&#039;s what I&#039;ve found here on SR anyway. Happy New Year to you all (except BiB if he is on here) and have a great 2013!

				One plausible explanation for things going missing that I haven&#039;t seen is perhaps things are going missing from people who tell all their mates they use SR.&nbsp; And their mates (or people their mates have told) manage to get to the letterbox before them. :)
