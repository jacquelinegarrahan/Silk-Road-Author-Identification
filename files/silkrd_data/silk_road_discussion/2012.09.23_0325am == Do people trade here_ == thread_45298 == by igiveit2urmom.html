				Hey guys im wondering about if there is any trading on this site? i thought it was cool all the selling, but was wondering if people actually do trades on here? and is it a big thing or not?<br /><br />Just because sure buying meds is nice, but if i have meds too and was thinking about selling them one day, so i could just use that money to buy the meds that i buy on here. It would just be way easier to see if anyone else would trade you, maybe if they wanted what you had and they had what you wanted. This would be pretty convenient!<br /><br />Or does anyone know any legit forums or websites that people trade their stuff for other persons stuff?<br /><br />any advice would be nice!

				No, because no seller on the website in their right mind would give them your address to ship to, and 99% of people offering deals on the forums are just scams

				you have a decent idea when it comes to obtaining bitcoins anonymously but you need to do it separately from an anonymous vendor account... like was mentioned the point for a seller is to not give away their location. if that was not obvious to you, imo you probably should not become a vendor though<br /><br />then once you have the coins finalized you send them to your buyer acct to order what you want. the vendor account costs $150 but if you have access to something like good H you will have as much business as you can handle and make your money back quickly

Ya i totally get that and that they wouldnt want you to know of their address. Haha damn.<br /><br />But yea i see, but i was mainly wondering because becoming a vendor is too much work for what im looking for. If i had a big stready supply and wanted to just make money ya it is definitely well worth it. But the point of my idea of trading was because I didnt really want to become a vendor, because i didnt want to fork out 150 bucks if im not going to be doing it to make money. Also for the fact that as a vendor i would have to probably have a larger supply and be selling a lot more maybe. <br /><br />I jsut think it would be convenient to be able to trade a person, that way like you could just both make a trade monthly or something like that, and more of as a convenience rather than having to sell your stuff to get bitcoins to buy the stuff you do want.&nbsp; <br /><br />would be cool though if they came up with a legit trading system in here like that you could mail it to some thing that can forward it to the address of the person to where the sender cant see where its going to
