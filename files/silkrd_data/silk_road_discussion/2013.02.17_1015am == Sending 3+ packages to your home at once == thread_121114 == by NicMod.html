				I think this is playing with fire, but people have different attitudes toward risk.

				I do not think LE would be monitoring how many packages come in to you unless they are already watching you. I received 3 packages in one week with no problems, although admittedly they did not contain any drugs. The thing is, they looked exactly as conspicuous as packages I have received that DID contain drugs. The only risk with receiving packages is with the vendors stealth. There is no way a judge would sign off on any warrant with &quot;He gets lots of mail&quot; being the only probable cause.

				I get packages all the time addressed under a business name. The nature of my business brings in a lot of mail from USA and Canada, and these are the only two countries I order from without using a separate drop. The other day I ran into my mail carrier while checking for an expected parcel. She asked politely if I ran a business and I said yes, and told her the details of it. She was friendly and responded with some questions that the owner of a business such as mine should know quite well. So we had a nice conversation and I didn&#039;t have any worry whatsoever when&nbsp; receiving the parcel that contained business of a different nature.

				I think that&#039;s what I was trying to get at.&nbsp; Amazon is kind of in its own world - their packages are pretty distinct.&nbsp; But, ebay vendors ship using the same methods that SR vendors use.&nbsp; So, domestic packages coming to a home address isn&#039;t sketchy as long as they&#039;re packaged with enough stealth to make them look &quot;normal.&quot;&nbsp; I mostly just buy pills, which is another reason I don&#039;t worry.&nbsp; Most of my shipments come in the smaller Priority Mail envelopes, they&#039;re vacuum sealed to prevent rattling, and there&#039;s never any problem.<br /><br />Granted, I might be the guy next week starting the thread that says I GOT BUSTED FOR USING SR, but for now, I feel pretty safe.

I have never had multiple drug orders coming in to a single location at the same time, but if it is vendor stealth that is the worry, there are the forums and the feedback. Also, if it is a vendor that you have received from before that has displayed excellent stealth I would not be worried about that vendors package being caught, and if all the packages are from vendors with stealth you have faith in, I would not worry about it at all.<br /><br />Well, maybe a little. But not as much as if it was a vendor who I have never tested myself before. <br /><br />There have been a couple people saying that even after a package got intercepted, others made it through to the same address with no issue. It would be safer though, as you said, to assume that they will inspect all packages after that. Solution to that could be to have a drop specifically for new vendors, so if their package gets caught then you are not completely screwed and all you have to do is find a new drop address.

				I have done it, but the packages arrived one day apart.&nbsp; I do get nervous and try to avoid doing it. They where all domestic so I figured the risk was lower, but if the first gets intercepted you will have a hard time explaining the rest

I was looking for a vendor where I could buy a good amount of ganja from. I am looking to get prices which would allow me to be able to make some money pushing it where I am from. I go to a really big college and I moved in recently with the rush master and another member of a Fraternity. I party with the fraternity often and all the members love their ganja. They smoke a lot of it and they have a lot of money from mommy and daddy to spend. Id assume several thousands of dollars of pot comes through the frat house of 60 members a week.<br />I checked you out on the forums and people really seem to like your product.<br />I was wondering if you could send me a sample. And I am sure you get asked this frequently (as a vendor myself, I get asked it a lot too). But I am being genuine. I have been on SR for 1.5 years, I am a vendor myself. I am not looking to get free drugs, I am looking for a long term dealer. I don&#039;t mind paying shipping or anything for the product. I just want to sample it to see if its up to my liking or not. Then I can start moving ALOT to the frat members.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Poster isn&#039;t saying &quot;I&#039;m getting a shit-ton of legit packages, plus one from SR&quot; but rather multiple packages from SR inbound at once. If there&#039;s shitty stealth or some other problem and one of the three gets opened, better pray it&#039;s the last one, because I would presume they&#039;ll open every package after that and then the hole just gets deeper.

				If it&#039;s domestic I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much.<br /><br />To be honest I just ordered a load of shit off Amazon and it all pretty much arrived around the same time. Not to mention, it all looked like SR stuff, pretty innocuous. I know many people that don&#039;t know about SR that order stuff in this way. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t seem to be suspicious and I doubt anyone even thinks about it. I think their first assumption will be that you just got paid and bought a load of stuff online.

Blotters I have no issue with sourcing internationally, since as far as I know they do not train drug dogs to detect stuff like LSD. On the fence about MDMA though, I would love to source some domestically but as you said the prices are higher, and international has to go through customs.

				In the start i fucked up and had several packs in my mailbox at one time.. I rarely EVER EVER order international. And i always order shit offline and have for years so thats nothing new to my mail lady.. But now I will only order 2 at the most!!! I dont order weed or anything that has a strong smell, I did one time and decided never again..<br /><br /><br />Iv been here around 7 months and if u normally never receive packages then all of a sudden u do, then it can be kinda questioning .. But at the same time right now USPS ARE ALL SOO PISSED about things they dont really give a fuck!! They just look your name make sure address is right and keep it moving..<br /><br />My mail lady and I know eachother so its nothing ,no biggie that paclages come in, but i dont like ordering from other countrys at all.. <br /><br />Agreed members? No more than 2 packs in Transit and within a couple days apart?
