				This may be in wrong forum.. if so.. I&#039;m sorry mods. :) But.. let&#039;s have a debate.. I&#039;m not sure if DPR has sold drugs before.. let alone even done drugs or even purchased them... but if DPR sold drugs on SR, what do you think they would be? :) also if DPR did drugs (some daily, some every now and then) what do you think they would be? Converse! [Maybe we will even hear from the great DPR himself;)]
