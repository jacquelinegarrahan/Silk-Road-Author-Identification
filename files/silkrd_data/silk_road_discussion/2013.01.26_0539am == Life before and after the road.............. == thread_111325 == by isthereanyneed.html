				Just thinking about stuff as you and I do not know how I survived before SR, buying shit weed having to put up with what ever strain I could get (most of time did not agree with me) and just dealing with dickheads who did not know the difference between sativa and indica or had never seen a&nbsp; cured bud in their lives.<br /><br />Its worth the extra money and risk I just worry this will be taken away from us, if SR was around years ago my life would of been so much better I can not begin to explain.<br /><br />What was your life like before you discovered SR and how has it changed since you discovered this wonderful place?

				I had to wait until festival season each year to acquire uncommon drugs such as LSD and MDMA.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not losing any money on Silk Road considering festival tickets, gas, parking, etc.

				i actually use less since im here..... because silk is missing that social atmosphere that surrounds street drugs...<br />its kinda interesting. i dont eat every shit up anymore. I used to take everything my dealer gave me. even if he did not have the slightest idea what was in the pills.....i just took it.. cause it got me fucked up. <br />now im a lot more clear headed.&nbsp; there is no social side here..&nbsp; no pressure.....and i think that makes it wonderful.

				People often ask me how I look so young, if only they knew the secret to my youthful looks and ways was smoking a high grade cannabis each and every day a sativa through the day and and a soothing indica at night most people would be shocked to realize that good quality cannabis actually improves health I hate having to lie but I don&#039;t think the people where I live are ready for the truth just yet they would most likely die on the spot from their tiny brains self com-busting trying to get their heads round the fact they have been lied to all their lives.I always knew in the back of my mind somewhere that weed had Hugh potentials for healing.

				I love the Silk Road. I&#039;m far beyond happy to know about this. It&#039;s changed my life for the better. Now i really never have to deal with all the bullshit that goes with the RL dealings.<br /><br />I live in a non-mmj state so getting good bud was always touch and go for me. Getting shit-weed or weed that was simply OK was easy to find. Shit attitudes/people were the norm. The good connections never seemed to last long, they either quit or moved. Having to dodge the police each time i went to get bud was always added stress.&nbsp; Now i can have it delivered, choose the strain i want, and get a good deal, along with a good attitude? Fuck yeah!! :)<br /><br />SR Rules!!

				I was uneducated before SR...didn&#039;t knew so many about substances,darknet,tor&nbsp; .I was a google idiot maybe still I&nbsp; am...but when a friend convinced me&nbsp; to take acid...whoooaaa<br /><br />I&nbsp; heard bad stories about acid and refused every time someone gave me...bla bla <br />A friend&nbsp; convinced me to take and I was amazed ..He took the acid from a festival .<br />I was so amazed and liked so much that I began to look for more..and never stopped <br /><br />He vague&nbsp; told me about an .onion website from where you can buy anything you want .This was back in the summer of 2011. <br />I managed to find this website...first I found BlakMarket and a week I thought that is the website lol. I was not impressed about BM...but a week later when i found SR that was a real shock .The offer was so vast <br /><br />So the life before acid was shit and life after acid is&nbsp; SR.<br /><br />The life after finding SR made me to learn , read more&nbsp; in the chemistry field. <br />The acid made me another person. I am more connected to the world .<br />SR is my psychedelic garden <br />

				for me personally, sr has been a godsend. i would not have access to any psychedelics otherwise, aside from the legal ones. without access to psychedelics, i would not be healing from a decade long chronic illness. they can be incredibly powerful psychotherapeutic tools when used as such. i am truly indebted to this community for giving me the opportunity to heal. i&#039;ve got nothing but love for all of you! :)

				The road has been a godsend to me too.&nbsp; I only smoke weed, never having an interest in anything else.&nbsp; But the thing is, I had gone many years without any weed. I&#039;m 49 and my days of having &quot;hip&quot; friends are long behind me.&nbsp; As is viewing a journey into a sketchy part of town as an adventure.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Now I buy top-quality weed safely. Over the fucking internet.&nbsp; This absolutely rocks. <br /><br />And while this forum has its share of dickheads and delusional windbags, most people here seem really, really cool. I&#039;d share my bong with any of you.<br />
