				So it appears as if all (or at least some) of bitcoins rapid climb in value has taken a crash back down to more normal levels. As a vendor deflation hurts you much more then it hurts us buyers and i am sorry about the potential financial stress it may have put on you. I really appreciate your efforts. Hopefully you got your coins out early and enjoyed some of the potential gains or avoided heavy loses. We all need to remember to watch the amount of bitcoin we have on hand that bitcoin as it is still fairly young and as such has its share of volatility. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Blacky

				Well I will be honest ive made some good money with BTC rise when people let their orders go to auto finalize and i also made some big losses yesterday quite a few orders at a loss i sent out today, but thats the name of the game. I got to take it on the chin and carry on. <br />My page&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0319a1315a

I am glad it worked out ok for you, but i am sure a few people ended up getting burned. I know i spend over 500 right at bitcoins peak which i&#039;m sure could end up being a loss for some vendor. The good news is that despite the volatility historically bitcoins are still a decently preforming investment, so holding them for awhile can gain you back some value.
