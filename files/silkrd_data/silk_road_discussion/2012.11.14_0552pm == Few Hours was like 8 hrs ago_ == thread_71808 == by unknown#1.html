				Dude, as a SR new user, I&#039;ve learned a very important lesson this past week. Don&#039;t rely on this site much, don&#039;t rely on the downtime being short, expect downtime, PGP, and that if DPR says a few hours, he really means few days.

				His post said all users will be allowed on with the next 24 hrs.. You still got 16hrs left b4 you can start your bitching.. Hold off!! For now only vendors can get on so they can get shit straight, update listings, and get packages out to people who have been waiting almost a week for there stuff.. All of this is completely understandable, so hold your tongue for a few more..

Ive been here for around 1.5 years now (forgot my old account password) and its the same attitudes just different screen names.. You have people from all walks of life coming here, your going to get a lil bit of everything.. And when it comes to a drug community, do you really expect the most competent, polite, and responsible people to be apart of it?? Not all drug users are the opposite of this but your view on reality is highly misconstrued if you believe most of them are what I described above...

				The site&#039;s being hammered like crazy, did you expect that after a week of tweaker&#039;s without their drugs (they really should find a real life source in case this sort of thing happens) that the site wuold load like lightning?<br /><br />SR is up and you just need to be patient, refresh, and change your identity.<br /><br />Most importantly, you need to stop fucking bitching, it&#039;s been going on for a god damned week now, grow up ...

				The reason you thought the site would be up at noon is because people don&#039;t know how to stop spreading bullshit not once has DPR said it would be up at noon and why would you listen to anyone else except an admin?&nbsp; no disrespect to mods or anyone else i&#039;m just saying the only two people that i know for sure with first hand knowledge of when the site will be re-open is inigo and DPR.&nbsp; The sites up, vendors are finishing up their buisness before the doors open, it&#039;s fixed.&nbsp; So please stop spreading chaos and false rumors on the forums

				FFS can&#039;t you just be happy that there is actual progress at this point?&nbsp; The sellers need time to get shit sorted before millions of bitchy buyers hop on and start complaining their shit hasn&#039;t shipped or that there&#039;s nothing for sale.&nbsp; Being patient now will make what comes later less annoying!&nbsp; Chillax.
