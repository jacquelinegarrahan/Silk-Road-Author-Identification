				1) means that he wants u to give the money free before he sending something!<br />So if he want he send something, if he dont he didnt!<br /><br />2) there are many ways, different on where u r from!<br /><br />3) jep, but if i where u search for an Vendor witch not bother u to Finalize Early, stay in Escrow and read the Forum what is discussed about the Vendors and then buy, not earlier!<br /><br /><br />And a Tip at the Side, if ur Vendor wants 4+ Transactions for not to FE, buy 0.15 Ebooks or so, and u have bought for that 0.6 BTC a bit more Safety for not waste ur money in FE Never Deliveries !&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />greets Zero Gravity

				on FEing:<br /><br />This is where they ask you to release funds early from escrow. The normal protocol is that you release the funds when the product arrives<br /><br />However as you are a new buyer, almost all vendors will ask you to finalise early as there is no guarantee that you won&#039;t just lie and say you didn&#039;t receive the package.<br /><br />It is ultimately your choice whether you do or not. Many people are very skeptical of FEing now because of a recent scam by one of the sites most trusted vendors that cost the sr community about $250,000<br /><br />Yet at the same time, it is seen as necessary for new buyers to prove themselves, and after you have a few purhcases vendors will trust you more and allow you to stay within escrow<br /><br />I would look at the guys feedback and make sure that he is 100% legit and has a lot of transactions before you order. Even so, there is no guarantee that you won&#039;t be scammed, it is unlikely, but it does happen. And as you are a new buyer, if you claim you didn&#039;t receive anything, SR admins will obviously side with the vendor as he has an established reputation<br /><br />So your choice is to either take the relatively small risk, or find a vendor that will allow new buyers to FE (you might be hard pressed to do such a thing)<br /><br />However when you have a few transactions under your belt and you are still asked to FE, be very wary.<br /><br />How many xanax did you want? I&#039;ve got a few spare that I can send to you for free if you like
