				So we know how much experience they have on the road and so new vendors know if they would be a good candidate for giving a sample to.

Not sure why people do it as in this anonymouse world where anything can be a scam, it means nothing!<br /><br />But, it also gives the polite man and his cop buddies a good way to find out who&#039;s worth the effort to bust!

				Hi, guys&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Haters gonna hate much?<br /><br />I post my stats in my signature so vendors have some idea of my track record when I leave reviews, inquire about potential purchases, or just shoot the shit.<br /><br />Yes, it can be faked, but vendors will see your real stats once you place an order with them. If they see you faked your stats, they won&#039;t be very likely to deal with you.<br /><br />Some newer vendors give out free sample to get reviews and generate a buzz. If people see that a person has a history they are more likely to offer them samples and/or take their reviews as meaningful.

				For new vendors and samples and to show off, which IMHO is completely fine. <br /><br />It&#039;s cool, too. Buying drugs and being able to anonymously show everyone how much you spend on it&nbsp; 8)

				oh, I was just being sarcastic lol.<br />But seriously, I just do it so others can have a good idea of my credibility, and kinda a proud thing to be like &quot;hey look i have no refunds or auto-finalization&#039;s!&quot;<br />I don&#039;t see why I shouldn&#039;t, I guess.
