				First off you can&#039;t just go to a &quot;bent&quot; doctor and get mass a amount of scripts for controlled substances anymore. There has been a new system that records everything, it&#039;s impossible to get around. Now, what you can do is find a &quot;bent&quot; doctor to write you scripts of meds you don&#039;t really need, i.e. oxy&#039;s etc. what they will do is write you the max amount allowed of each medication they prescribe a month. <br /><br />Now to find these doctors you have to start &quot;doctor shopping&quot; which means hitting up every pain management in your area till you find a doctor willing to do this. No, it&#039;s not cheap but there is no other option unless you start talking to junkies. Like that other guy said when you&#039;re looking for what you are, this is really the best way. <br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for real mass amounts of prescription drugs what you need to do is go to places like India and find someone to sell you a custom synthed kilo of w/e you want. There&#039;s also Mexico where you can go to the small mom and pops pharmacy&#039;s and just offer cash for meds, they will usually accept but they will charge a lot more then what they did 10 years ago when you could go pick up gallon ziplock bags of oc&#039;s for nex to nothing, it&#039;s not like that anymore over there.

				I&#039;m meaning around 500-1000 and I understand the U.S. Has regulations over how many you can be scripted but do foreign countries? The main friend I have who does this He has over 5,000 Xanax at one time , all In prescription bottles to his name? Can anyone shed any light on how he has that if there&#039;s regulations? Another thing is if I found a bent doctor that would just do the maximum allowed wouldn&#039;t I be able to have multiple people I use go in and get scripts under differant names ? Or would It be possible to use fake or frauded&nbsp; Identifications ?

				Sounds like you have no idea how this works.&nbsp; Do a lot of research before you go to doctors and try to get scripts.&nbsp; Many crooked doctors are constantly getting busted and if they snitch about you or the LE find something odd about your file, prepare to get questioned and possibly go to jail.&nbsp; They are taking this shit real serious nowadays.&nbsp; My friends doctor got busted for this so it&#039;s very real.

				You dont have to find a bent doctor, a mate of mine has found a really shit doctor who doesnt give a shit about his patients and will prescribe them anything that they say has worked for them before, he now gets script xanax and all the sleepers and pain meds he says he needs, looking for a lazy uninterested doctor will be easier to find than a bent one id say!

				Go to florida pain clinics. the statewide pharmacy database is non existent there so you can hit up ten clinics a day if you have the cash, then hit ten different pharmacies. shits pretty well known way of buying bulk. the great part is you can transport all the meds out of state because the scripts are legit. netflix has documentary&#039;s on the shit

				Go to an NA meeting, look for a Dr. (pain clinic) that advertises in the back of the phone book, on benches at bus stops, etc, most doctors that roll like that aren&#039;t the most straight up
