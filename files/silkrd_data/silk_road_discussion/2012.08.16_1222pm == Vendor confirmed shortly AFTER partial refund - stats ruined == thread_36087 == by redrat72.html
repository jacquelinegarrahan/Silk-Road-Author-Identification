				hello,<br /><br />like some of you, I have been stiffed by vendor &quot;High Supplies&quot;. ordered a substantial quantity of coke (about 800 $) and got nothing. after going into resolve mode, finally had to agree to 50% refund or otherwise it would have auto-finalized.<br /><br />as it turned out only a few days later, the vendor was officially declared a confirmed scammer, account gone and whatnot. what remains is a loss of about 400 $ (nothing I can do about that) but also ruined stats. doh. my 20+ transactions have been flawless so far, however due to this one incident I now have a quite high return rate that must look very unattractive to other vendors. so I&#039;m here, no coke, 400 $ gone and my stats f***ed up for I have done nothing evil and nothing wrong :(<br /><br />upon consulting SR support, they were very helpful, but couldn&#039;t correct my stats due to DPR being the almighty master over the user data and not allowing his brave helpers to access user data. <br /><br />I am posting this to see<br />1) if there is some input on how to avoid situations like that in the future<br />2) if maybe DPR is reading this too and willing to help me, pleeeeease Dread Pirate Roberts!!<br />3) to make a mark for future transactions with other vendors so I don&#039;t have to explain my stats all over again<br /><br />feedback of any kind is very much appreciated!<br /><br />cheers<br />redrat72<br /><br />PS: forgot to mention that I also got ripped of before via the dreaded FE trick by &quot;Noriega&quot; and &quot;iDesign&quot;...<br /><br />

				As far as I know, once an order is put into resolution, you don&#039;t have to worry about auto-finalize anymore.

				I thought it was a given that you make a little research about the vendor before buying from him. If there&#039;s something suspecious about him you shouldn&#039;t risk it and order from him.<br />Buy the way i was in your exact situation a few months ago and you are right about the stats. They are unchangeable. I had to change my account then.
