				its long been rumoured the only way to stop SR and other such sites is to screw with the currency.......also and maybe im just jumping head first into conspiracy territory but could it just be coincidence that this happens shortly after 2 GB police officers where killed by hand grenades thought to have been purchased online......more reason removing the Armory is a bloody good idea<br /><br />MtGox · 974 like this.<br />35 minutes ago · <br /><br /><br />Temporary suspension of all GBP Deposits via Barclays<br /><br />&nbsp;It is with regret that we have to inform our British users that you will no longer be able to deposit British Pounds (GBP) to our Barclays bank account from now on.<br /><br />&nbsp;While we have not yet been formerly contacted by Barclays or any of its representatives, we are as for today, unable to accept any GBP deposits into our Barclays account. Rest assure that we are doing our best to get to the bottom of this situation as well as being able to resolve this matter one way or another with Barclays or via other British and/ or European Banks.<br /><br />&nbsp;Meanwhile, please note that you can still use our Polish EUR Bank account for both Deposits and Withdrawals as well as our Japanese GBP account for deposits and withdrawals (additional fees may apply).<br /><br />&nbsp;On Behalf of the entire Mt.Gox team, please accept our apologizes for any inconvenience this temporary suspension of GBP deposits may have caused.<br /><br />&nbsp;Regards<br />&nbsp;Mt.Gox Co.

				let hope they approach more risk taking UK banks like cooperative, HSBC, even santander and Natwest should be accommodating, they are all desparate for cash flow.<br /><br />bad new, hope its a temporary blip, UK folk can get bitcoins through REPUTABLE and currently successful vendors here for ukash, LR and other forms of digital payment, athough may incur more fees :(

				HSBC? That&#039;s a laugh. HSBC wont be touching anything shady for a long time. They have been closing accounts that they can find any grounds of being suspicious without notice to meet the UN&#039;s book-worms coz of all the shit that happened with the Blow money.

				I just tried to make a deposit and was told by the guy working there that the account has been closed. I&#039;m screwed now. I have no way of safely purchasing bitcoins. FUCK! It was so convenient to just walk in and pay with cash like that. How else do you UK folk purchase your coins? I could do with a method that doesnt sting me with service charges. The drugs here are already expensive and i could do with not having to fork out more money. Cheers

				I thought that was going to happen eventually. Intersango, Mtgox, who next?<br /><br />Limet is correct, HSBC won&#039;t be touching anything questionable for a longtime, if ever again, Barclays decided to follow in their footsteps. I don&#039;t really understand why the majority decide to deal with these major BTC exchanges, that deal with major banks, to deal with, in most instances here, illegal contraband - Not good. Before anybody contemplates making their first purchase here, they need to learn which methods will work best, learn how to mix/tumble/fog your coins to limit their taint, to keep your transaction anonymous. That&#039;s the keyword here: ANONYMOUS, your dealing with an anonymous market, so you need to take every single precaution you can to keep yourself anonymous.<br /><br />I tried to help out but got inundated with PMs on another thread, few I helped, the ones with a decent post count that have been registered a while, but the rest I left be, it wouldn&#039;t be wise of me to try to help someone registerd today with a post count of 2 lol! What most don&#039;t realize there are plenty of other opinions out there, take your time, do your research, realize this and it will become clear. Good luck! :)<br /><br />P.S. Why doesn&#039;t an SR member start up their own BTC in the mail service? Looks there&#039;s a gap in the market here, or is there already one?

				There was a &#039;decent&#039; cash in the mail service.<br /><br />Until the dude who ran it took off with the cash. Left a bitter taste in many mouths. Narrowly missed being caught in it ourselves.<br /><br />As per the previous post, does anyone know how this effects withdrawing money from Mt Gox?

Logically, if your money is already in your account this should not be an issue.Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but when a bank terminates an account, they need to give 30 days notice to complete any transactions. I believe this is what happened with Intersango. However Intersango are a UK based company, and MtGox is a Japanese company, so different rules may apply.<br /><br />Btw, Mtgox are stating it&#039;s a *temporary* suspension, the same thing happened with Intersango over the summer, before they closed for good. If you&#039;ve already got a transfer processing, before this announcement, I&#039;m pretty sure it will come through, it might be delayed though. If your insistent on using MtGox and are in the UK, they&#039;re saying:<br /><br />&quot;Meanwhile, please note that you can still use our Polish EUR Bank account for both Deposits and Withdrawals as well as our Japanese GBP account for deposits and withdrawals (additional fees may apply).&quot;<br /><br />You don&#039;t always need to use sterling, it will just be more expensive, and slightly more time consuming.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry for everybody that is in this situation, and I sincerely wish everyone the best of luck!&nbsp; :)
