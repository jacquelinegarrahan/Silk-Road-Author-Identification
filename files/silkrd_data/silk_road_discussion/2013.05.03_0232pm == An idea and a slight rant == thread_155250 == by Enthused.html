				As everyone knows it&#039;s bloody hard to get on Silk Road but as a vender I&#039;m starting to worry as I can never get on! I signed in at 5.33AM UK Time and haven&#039;t be able to since, Surely DPR could create certain times where access is limited just to venders for a few hours a day, Just to allow venders to get on and sort out orders etc. I agree that money is made through the buyer but if there is no vender to &#039;Transit&#039; those orders then no money is made on the venders half and SR&#039;s half. I&#039;m not saying at all that DPR hasn&#039;t/isn&#039;t doing a great job! As this guy is my hero, DPR is someone I&#039;d follow and support through anything. I really hope this gets sorted as I&#039;m sure there are a lot of venders wanting to sort out their business and get there coins out of there before it drops anymore!<br /><br />D

				I find refreshing is working for me. Sometimes I timeout or can&#039;t connect two maybe three times but I wait a few mins and keep refreshing.<br /><br />Not sure if new identities are helping or not I don&#039;t click &#039;use new identity&#039; too often and I&#039;ve been getting pretty good access mostly from refreshing.<br /><br /><br />

				Ha! That doesn&#039;t work for me at all! It just keeps timing out, I&#039;m sure pressing &#039;Use a new identity&#039; just makes the entire wait longer :/ Does reinstalling work?

				I have a hard time getting on SR too, I can&#039;t seem to get in using tails at all so I have to use the tor bundle.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a dsl (that sucks and is slow) and cable internet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can never get on with my slower connection during high traffic times and even when i do connect during off hours I get alot of time outs.<br /><br />My faster connection works fine but the login screen takes a long time to load, like 30 seconds or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />So you think it could it be your internet connection?&nbsp; I don&#039;t use wireless and I imagine that can help.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Ah, this is interesting:<br /><br />The satellite connection I use terminates in either Italy or France (I can choose the LNB and host route) and SR is just fine. <br /><br />I just switched to a wire line fiber circuit which routes within the BT UK core network and I can&#039;t access SR at all.<br /><br />Funky. <br /><br />Maybe there is not so much of an attack going on at the exit nodes near the SR servers , but at the entry / exit nodes of SR users. This could explain why DPR is having such a mare of a time counteracting the attack and why some get access at times and others not. <br /><br />Enthused - can you spin up an Amazon EC2 instance based in the Asia Pacific region, route a VPN locally into it and then use TOR via that IP route? This should be OK security wise and could prove the theory. Fuck it, I&#039;ll give it a go tonight and let you know. <br /><br />Erl. <br /><br />

				Same story here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I think there will be benefit in the future to use &#039;relay&#039; feature in TOR. <br /><br />I used it between a server at the office (running the relay and great access to SR through selecting a path manually until I find a good and fast one. ) and then over to my home<br />Machine.&nbsp; <br /><br />It links to the office relay and I get on fast and keep the same path or tunnel for a Long time until it goes bad Nd I have to manually find another good and fast one.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I hope this gives some ideas.

				Doing this would be admitting barely accessible SR is the new norm for the foreseeable future. Rather than provide a work around to assist with the accessibility problem, all resources should be focused on actually solving the problem ASAP.

				Ya no doubt.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only answer is more bandwidth and mirror sites like all the big sites do.&nbsp; <br />You gotta wonder how the other sites manage attacks and what&#039;s so different here. <br /><br />I&#039;d be willing to pay for a monthly account that is fast access.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure other would too.&nbsp; Then, the free version of the site can be for tourists and window shoppers. <br /><br />&nbsp; Real buyers and vendors can enjoy pay-for-access, or go with the free site of hey don&#039;t want to pay. .&nbsp; &nbsp;Sounds fair.&nbsp; The pay site wouldn&#039;t get attacked as easily, because you lock out the attacker by canceling his account and using dynamic addressing for the front door.&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; It&#039;s all been said I guess already. <br /><br />I just want in so I can spend my money.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m starting to see a trend here.&nbsp; Whenever there is a sale or cheap coin prices, this happens to slow buyers down. It&#039;s like clockwork.&nbsp; Or like clockwork orange. (!)<br />

				This thread reads like no one knows there is s DDOS attack going on. How does limiting access to vendors help if no one can even load the login page? The bigger problem with your suggestion is that DPR is never going to create an elite class (vendors) who take priority over the more numerous subjects (buyers). What you are suggesting, though well intentioned, is exactly what SR is meant to fight against.<br /><br />As for buying more bandwidth and mirroring the site: Are you smoking your own product? This isn&#039;t amazon.com. Can you imagine the number of LE that would show up if they could get the location of the SR server? Should he just order 5 or 6 industrial size bandwidth pipes to his house and hope no one notices? Maybe see if CNET will host a mirror? lol<br /><br />

				Tested some theories out last night and no conclusive results I&#039;m afraid. <br /><br />I think the DoS attack has multiple initiation points and multiple attack points both at the TOR level and onion routing level and that they are moving these two around a LOT. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think this is the work one individual or small collective, unless botnets are involved and they&#039;ve worked out a way of silently running a tor circuit and exploiting that. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also noticed that the TOR network seems heavily reliant on a single point in the US this morning, which is somewhat unusual.
