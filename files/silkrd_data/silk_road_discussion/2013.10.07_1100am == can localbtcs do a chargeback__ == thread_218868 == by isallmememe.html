				i just went and ordered £30 worth of btc on there and as soon as i did the transfer and clicked to confirm payment i scrolled to the top of the page to watch for the notification to tell me i got payed. i immediately spotted that 0.445 btc was in my wallet and thought to myself &#039;fuck me that was quick, that was seriously fucking quick&#039;. then i realized i had only bought 0.3800 btc and that was more than i bought. before i could even think &#039;wtf is going on?&#039; another 0.3800 btc went into the wallet and it was apparent that the first 0.44 was already in there. now i know my wallet was empty, it always is as i always transfer it out as soon as i get it. so i dunno where the other £35 came from. at first i transferred the 0.38 out that i bought cause i wasn&#039;t sure i wanted the bonus in the same place, but as soon as i did that i thought fuck it, i can transfer it somewhere else if i want, so then i transferred the rest to the same place. so far the 0.38 has turned up where i sent it, but the rest hasn&#039;t. it was like 1 minute between each transfer but its been about 10 minutes now and the rest hasn&#039;t turned up.<br /><br />what you all think is going on, and is it likely i will get charged back for it? ..i was under the impression btc transfers were final.
