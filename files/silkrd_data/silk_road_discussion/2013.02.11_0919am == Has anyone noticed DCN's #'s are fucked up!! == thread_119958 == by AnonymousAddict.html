				The last few packages i got have eaither shown the tracking as deliverd but has not been&lt; then shows up a day or to later&gt;<br /><br />aND NOW i had APACKage sent priority friday and i got it saturday from west to east coast&lt; which was amazing i have never had a priority pack come in less than 24hrs from coast to coast.. But i just happen to look at the dcn # on usps out of curiousness and its showingits still going and being scanned through sort facilitys and all, like its still on the way to me. But i already got it.<br />It must have something to do with the new tracking.. cause i have NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS. <br /><br />Like i got something sent from AUS, International express. I tracked it, and Monday i saw my mail lady and 3 hrs later i check the usps site and it said &#039;Slip left no recipient was home to sign&#039; WTF? So i called and it said clear as day it was in my P O. SO i called up there the next morning (THIS WAS NOT DRUGS BTW JUST CASH) And the&nbsp; PO SAID no they did not have it and i know my postal women very well, i use to be involved with lets say someone close to her. <br /><br />So the PO says the truck is here,maybe its on it, so i had to SLOWLY EXPLAIN LIKE TO A CHILD my tracking showed my fucking package was there, ,she of course said call back.. So i call back 3 hrs later, and she says nope no Package for,u..So then sas maybe its coming ups or fed ex sir? I HAD TO TELL HER AGAIN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL!!!&nbsp; SO she says wait then hold on, then comes back and repeats my address and says yeah we have it just came in today ...<br /><br />WTF?? IT CLEARLY SHOWED IT HAD TRIED TO BE DELIVERD WHICH I KNEW WAS WRONG AND THEN SAID IT WAS AT MY PO...THE LADY SAID since it was express after it clears customs they have only 2 days to get it to u and they messed up and marked it anyway so they wuldnt have to regund the money..and also the tracking is messing up...<br /><br />HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THIS?&nbsp; I was thinking FML CONTROL DELIVERY IS GOINGDOWN...but its all good

				Yes, I agree since the tracking change, the DCN has been a little qwerky. Hasn&#039;t been extremely bad as far as the ratio of packages ive sent out but hopefully it&#039;ll smooth back out soon.

				XXX<br /><br />I was thinking it was just me.. They have made it worse not better..I mean the USPS//THE DCN #s were much better. At least they were correct and accurate.. Now i have #s saying there in sort centers and still updating like their getting scanned that day but are already at my house...<br /><br />I hope this is not how its gonna be full time with this Tracking..<br /><br />NO ONE ELSE has noticed this?
