				I have noticed recently that a few vendors tend to undercut competition but require excessive shipping costs. This means that their product looks cheaper at first glace, but when you do the maths (sale price+shipping) they can often end up being the most expensive offer. This is the case with &quot;gotmilk&quot;, who offers equivalent quantities of Armodafinil for slightly cheaper than everyone else, but then asks for ฿0.18 worth of shipping while some of his competition offer shipping for free. Though I don&#039;t really respect this business practice I have nothing against it per se: vendors have the right to engage in whatever activity brings them more money. <br /><br />However, I do believe there would be a very simple solution to this: modify the API when navigating the marketplace so that the quoted prices include the shipping options. This both gives buyers a better idea of how much they will actually be spending and could also curb this business practice.<br /><br />Does anyone agree with me?<br />Or do you just have no fucks to give?<br />What do you think? <br /><br />N.B.: I have nothing against &quot;gotmilk&quot;. Everything I stated about him or his goods is factual information.
