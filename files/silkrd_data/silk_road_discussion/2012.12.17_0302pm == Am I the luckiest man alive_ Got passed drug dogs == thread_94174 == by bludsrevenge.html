				Someone fucking explain this to me. I was in line to board a train a few minutes ago with no luggage other than my backpack filled with the usual. Ya kno, some clothes, headphones, my passport, 3 kilo&#039;s of cocaine, and a heat sealer with bags. I was going to seal up the cocaine, but I figured, why waste time now, I have things to do, a train to make. So I left them in nothing but Saran wrap and plastic bags. They check my ticket and I go through the door. That&#039;s where it happened. On the other side of the door there was three dogs and officers with K-9 drug unit on all of their clothes. Needless to say I freaked the fuck out. For some reason I started shivering and sweating at the same time. This being the second scariest moment of my life. I continued to walk passed the dogs, which all followed me with their heads as I walked by and on to the train. NOTHING HAPPENED. That is unless they have a group of cops waiting to arrest me when I get off(this literally just happened I am on the train now), which is highly unlikely. Needless to say there is only one thing a sane person would do now in this situation. Get up, go to the bathroom, and do a line out of my little &quot;to go kit.&quot; <br /><br />As a side note, I just realized I have an ounce of some beautiful home grown super lemon haze in my bag also, but it is sealed up the way it is supposed to be.

				Thats .... wow I wouldn&#039;t even have the balls to get off the train with it.<br /><br />I hope to god for you that everything turns out ok and my thought&#039;s (I hate to use the word prayer&#039;s ... since i&#039;m atheist) go fully out to you man.<br /><br />If it were me, i&#039;m such a pussy as soon as I saw the dogs I woulda dropped my bag and ran like a nuclear bomb just went off and I was trying to escape the exclusion zone ! <br />You&#039;ve got balls of steel in my eyes man lol.<br /><br />122345 has a point though, I don&#039;t understand how you wouldn&#039;t do everything to conceal the coke right before getting on a train to traffic it, and bring along a heat sealer that&#039;s gonna make your case look even worse.&nbsp; Shoulda used the heat sealer BEFORE boarding the train :D

				Aparently dogs sense semells in a completely different manner. When we smell a stew or soup, we smell the whole mixture. Dogs sense it as: Carrots, Meat, Celery. When they smell the air they have the ability to smell just about anything, even vacuum&nbsp; sealed. Aparently, the training is sometimes manipulated to the point of the dog sensing when the controller wants a bark, at which point, the dog will give it and probable cause is set in motion. Also the dogs must be actively in search for a drug, instead of sitting quietly with his master.<br /><br />

Otherwise they just let the world roll by.&nbsp; <br /><br />You got lucky. Don&#039;t forget it.

Controlled studies have shown as high as 40% false positive rate, which you won&#039;t hear in any LE PR campaign. They want you to believe those mutts can detect residue in a bag from 100 meters away, but this is not the first case that I&#039;ve heard of someone with quantity walking right past them.

				it won&#039;t end well. you should not have done those lines. when your body cleans from coke it will be in your armits with sweat and dogs can smell that. when im high and sweating when i go past the police dogs they always start barking at me like crazy. just hope that there won&#039;t be any police when you walk out.

				I&#039;m still on the train, getting off in about an hour. I&#039;m not worried about anything. Again big lessened learned. To the person who said I was going to smell, I have been doing this long enough to know how to mask the smell of my cocaine sweat. It is the fact that I have been doing this so long that made me cocky. I am completely sober and ready to go home now. Usually I wouldn&#039;t be transporting 3 kilos over the country on a train. What happened was I was on vacation in Florida. I was going home today and the coke was supposed to be delivered to my house turns out the smuggler, who I am friends with was going through Florida before the delivery. I figured why make him work so hard. I had my heat sealer with me as always because I usually carry weight for my own pleasure on me and It is an easy wey to not get smelled out so I thought easy. Then I decided, &quot;what the fuck is going to happen to me, I have been doing this flawlessly for so long.&quot; This was my stupid mistake. I deserve the hate it just was a fucking dumb ass move<br /><br /><br />I wrote this last paragraph right before the cops got me. Everyone should know I figured it out. Im not the luckiest man alive. I&#039;m god. It&#039;s that simple. That can be the only answer.<br />What happened is the train stopped at the stop before where I was getting off. Two tall white cops come over to me and ask me to get off. At this point I am saying to myself that I had a pretty good run as a free man and I was trying to mentally prepare myself for the 14 inches of my new cell mate, bubba&#039;s, dick in my asshole. They take me off the train and I don&#039;t say anything about the backpack, hoping that it wouldn&#039;t be connected to me when discovered when everyone got off the train later and the bag was still there. I told them a box I had was all of my stuff. They bring me into the little police security room in the train station. They sit me down and tell me to wait. I waited for a while then a police officer comes in with my backpack which I had ditched asking me if it was mine. I figured I might as well say yes because if I say no they will look through it find the coke, fingerprint the bag, and connect it to me so I had nothing to loose. The cop puts the bag in front of me and says, &quot; we recieved two phone calls about suspicious behavior coming from you. I kept getting up to go to the bathroom every few minutes, which apperently constitutes suspicious behavior. Also apperently someone said, &quot;I stunk like drugs&quot;. The officer then proceeded to ask me what I was doing which I replied, &quot;I am sick, what is it a crime to be sick?&quot; He then told me to take a shower and that I just smell like shit, no drugs. He told me to wait and I did. Then he came back and told me he was giving me a ride to my destination. He apologized for the mess because as he said, you never know with these terrorists these days and added a remark how because I was white I was obviously not a terrorist. I just arrived safely and sound. That is my story how a cop delivered me my lost cocaine and then drove me and the cocaine to my house for my use. God Fucking Bless America<br /><br />As a side note I really don&#039;t understand why they didn&#039;t look through my backpack. I&#039;m not going to complain or anything, but what if I had bombs or some shit. Also if someone said this story to me I wouldn&#039;t believe them, so I don&#039;t care if you believe it or not. This was one crazy fucking day and I am lucky to be able to use my iPhone right now to post this, as opposed to the bubba dick I would be receiving by now. Thanks to everyone who gave advice.

				I&#039;ve read articles that dogs might not like someone when he&#039;s nervous or uncomfortable too because they can smell somehow this from sweat. best bet while smuggling drugs through dogs would be to put in someone elses luggage who has no idea that he&#039;s carrying drugs. and later retrieve it somehow.<br /><br />For example you meet some average or bad looking girl and play that you&#039;re in love and want to travel to colombia&nbsp; with her. Then put vodka bottle in her luggage (dissolved cocaine which can later be retrieved by chemical reactions) and get tickets your first class lets say hers 3rd class and tell her there were only two left. And well if she gets caught you don&#039;t know her or have no idea whats in that bottle its not yours.

				Well now I know my story wasn&#039;t so magical. I went to finally weigh out the product and one of the packeges was clearly cut open with scissors and some amount of coke was taken. About an ounce. It would seem I now know why I waited for so long in the police security room. They were having a fucking party. I&#039;m just thankful they weren&#039;t any more greedy and only took an ounce. This explains why it went so smoothly. I bribed the cop without even knowing it. The loss sucks, but it&#039;s better than jail any day.<br />By the way, I take the train all the time and not once have I seen a k-9 drug unit checking out passengers. If I knew that the dogs would have been there I would have been a little smarter.<br /><br />&nbsp;Youv gotta admit I&#039;m pretty damn lucky he didn&#039;t just take it all.

Not saying it isn&#039;t true but it sounds too good to be. How the hell did they found the coke in your bag? It&#039;s not like any dogs barked at you, you had a pretty good run at the k9 checkpoint. So because you were moving a lot and going through the bathroom some no-life passenger reported your &quot;suspect&quot; behavior, thinking you were a terrorist or something along those lines? Please tell me you are joking, or there are people who really have nothing better to do of their live than to watch someone go to the toilets... <br /><br />Also, that racist cop...wtf

				I&#039;m sorry to say that I don&#039;t believe a word of this anymore and it&#039;s just a complete troll thread.&nbsp; I also almost don&#039;t feel any sympathy (even if it was true, because the myriad of mistakes you claim to have made, not to mention labeling yourself as &#039;god&#039;, you need a kick to your ego bud (kid?)<br /><br />Anyways, only reason I posted again in this thread is to respond to 12345&#039;s remark about taking benzo&#039;s before doing something illegal thinking they&#039;ll help you get away with it cuz you&#039;ll act more relaxed.&nbsp; Yes you&#039;ll feel more relaxed, but benzo&#039;s change how the smooth muscles in your face function.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a very small change but most cops have been trained to look for it when they&#039;re talking to you and if they have been trained, they will know with certainty that you&#039;ve taken a benzo.&nbsp; There is NOTHING you can do, no amount of training, or experience with benzo&#039;s (i&#039;ve used them for well over a decade) because they alter the smooth muscle in your face.&nbsp; Smooth muscle is one of the 3 types of muscles and it is INVOLUNTARILY controlled by your autonomic nervous system.&nbsp; That is to say, you can&#039;t consciously change how this type of muscle contracts or expands, and benzo&#039;s affect the autonomic nervous system (by depressing it).&nbsp; <br /><br />Think of if it were possible to change how your heart (which is a muscle, a different type but also involuntarily controlled by the nervous system) muscle contract and expands through conscious thought, you&#039;d be able to kill yourself easily without even necessarily meaning to, it&#039;s completely controlled by your nervous system and you have no control whatsoever on how smooth or cardiac muscle react.&nbsp; The only of the 3 types of muscle you have conscious control over is skeletal (the three types are smooth, cardiac and skeletal).&nbsp; These muscles in your face are also altered (relaxed) when you take a benzo and you can with practice control them enough so that this type of muscle doesn&#039;t appear to be under the influences of a benzo, but the smooth muscle in your face cannot be consciously controlled ... no matter how hard you try, or how smart you think you are.<br /><br />At ports of entry (airports, train stations, etc.) officers are almost always trained in identifying this because many people trying to smuggle something (or blow up a plane) use them in an attempt to ACT normal, but they won&#039;t look normal.<br /><br />So don&#039;t take a benzo before going to the airport or train station unless you have a valid (and recent, not like a script from 2004) prescription bottle of them on you when you&#039;re at the train station/airport thinking it will aid you in acting normal and getting away with smuggling.&nbsp; In most train stations/airports there is at least one officer trained on identifying if you are under the influence of a benzo, and if you are they&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve taken anything (already knowing you have), so lying to them is gonna immediately put up a red flag and you don&#039;t want that lol !<br /><br />This isn&#039;t me being paranoid, it&#039;s something you have NO control over and could be the only thing that get&#039;s you caught.&nbsp; So i&#039;m begging you guys not to take a benzo BEFORE having to confront someone of authority at a train station or airport, feel free to take em on the bus/train/plane once you&#039;ve been let on, but not before,&nbsp; I&#039;m quite certain what &#039;ve said is true, and just warning you guys cuz I would never wish to see someone locked up for trafficking all because they took a benzo to try and act ...normal while having 3 keys of coke in your backpack.&nbsp; Especially if you&#039;re boarding a plane/train returning in a foreign country.&nbsp; There are countries whose prisons are so violent that you&#039;d be wishing it was just Bubba raping in an American prison.<br /><br />Anyways, just a warning, be careful if your smuggling across borders, none of us want to get caught :(

				From my experience, drug dogs do not work when around a lot of activity.<br />I went to a rave one time, and right before that someone wiped the left over table that had cocaine all over it, and thought it was smart to then pat it off on the knee of my jeans.<br />When in line and passing through security, 2 drug dogs literally a meter away from my knee were standing there and never even reacted. I don&#039;t think I could have even had a stronger scent of cocaine on me if I tried.<br />It&#039;s very hit and miss imo.

				You&#039;re lucky but don&#039;t risk it again.<br /><br />A dog is only as good as its handler. I&#039;ve been sniffed by dogs at festivals with quite a bit before and was let straight through. Been through multiple airport scanners with half an ounce of weed I had no idea was in my hand luggage and been patted down and let through when intentionally taking a couple of grams through. Had a police van pull up and ask which way a guy they were chasing ran when smoking a huge joint and they didn&#039;t b bat an eyelid.<br /><br />It&#039;s not big or clever though, sooner or later your luck will run out so don&#039;t gt lazy or be as stupid as I used to be.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

				Cant beleive anyone would be so gullible as to beleive this.<br />All this security is largely a bluff - the only way they catch you is prior intelligence of pure random good luck. Theres no way police you would get caught on a train and if you did the cops would do their worst on you. You would by now be banged up enjoying bubbas company.

				I also have a success story from getting past sniffer dogs- maybe not quite as risky as this one but still very very risky.<br />Last year my friends and I went to a popular British music festival, we go every year and had been several times before. We took a whole bunch of Weed, Diazepam and Ecstasy to sell there, luckily we had bagged it up several times and put the stuff in with our tents.<br />Anyways, we were driving down in two cars, myself and 4 of my friends, two of my friends drove in the car infront. So we pull up at the festival and just as we are going through the gate to the carpark (with ques of traffic behind us) I see three guys standing in plain cloths with sniffer dogs, the proceed to waive my friends infront who are carrying no drugs into the car park and single us out for a random search.<br />I was absolutely shitting myself, trying not to shake as they had the dog jumping all around the car right next to the 500 ecstasy. I was sure we were going to be busted because we had only just put out a spliff maybe 20 minutes before arriving.<br />We all just talked to the guy calmly, trying not to show how fucking terrified we were and the dog didnt alert them to anything - so they let us on our way.<br />I still don&#039;t know how that dog didnt smell any drugs in our bags or atleast the green from the spliff we had been smoking but my guess was that they must use &quot;trainee&quot; sniffer dogs at festivals and the like.

				I found this website and this to me explains it.&nbsp; <br />http://www.cannabisculture.com/node/8634<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Some police, however, fail to properly guide the drug dog during an “air sniff” of a vehicle’s exterior. After interviewing captured cartel members I learned they had great confidence in their masking techniques because they had seen US Customs and Border Patrol walk their dogs past a trunk full of sticky Mexican bricks without alerting. It must have been the excellent packaging, right? No. Those people drew an inaccurate conclusion from an accurate observation. The truth is – and many expert K-9 trainers agree – that only one out of ten K-9 teams in America are efficient enough to reliably detect contraband. Said another way, most K-9 teams in the US just suck at their job, so the load of green slipped past the police because of a poorly trained dog, not because of any special masking efforts used by the smugglers. Another reason contraband is undetected by dogs is the handler’s failure to present the drug detecting dog to permeating “scent cones” that emanate from the marijuana’s hiding spot.&quot;
