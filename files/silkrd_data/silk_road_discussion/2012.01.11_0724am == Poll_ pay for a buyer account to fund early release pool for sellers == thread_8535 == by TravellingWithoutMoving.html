				buy accounts to fund Escrow / finalise early pool suggestion:<br /><br />- buyer account +-$40<br />- all deposit goes into the seller escrow / finalise early pool<br />- seller is paid early from the pool<br /><br /><br />- unsure what the criteria would be for sellers to have access to the finalise early pool, hopefully some new vendors are allowed access to this too...<br /><br />- i would be prepaid to buy an account if it helps achieve the above, $40 might not cover all purchases but the % of bad sales to good ones is low (?)<br /><br />&nbsp;:D<br />

				I wish that the sellers that can&#039;t manage their working capital die a slow painful death :) There&#039;s been so much whining and bitching about this issue (guess what folks, running a business takes raw work, management, AND capital), I just can&#039;t believe it.

				Sellers just have to chip in for the cost of their accounts once. Buyers get charged money every single time they make a purchase. Now you want them to pay for the privillege of paying the higher escrow amounts SR is implementing for smaller orders. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t have the capital to hold on until money comes out of escrow then you should adjust your expectations to match reality and just sell your wares as you have the money to restock them. If you can&#039;t afford to keep them in stock while waiting for escrowed funds to clear, then it is unreasonable to expect to be able to sell constantly. When your local dope dealer runs low on product and still has his re-up money out on the streets, the local heads don&#039;t get together to fund him/her. You&#039;d also be asking SR to pay out funds to potential scammers who would normally not get shit if they had to wait on escrow. That 40 dollars is pretty damn steep also for first time buyers trying to feel out the site. Get your game on track and stop trying to take money out of the pockets of the customers who enable all merchants to make money here.

				Why the fuck should we as buyers do this?&nbsp; Vendors make good money, I&#039;d guess 40-60% (depending on item) of a sale is profit.&nbsp; Finalizing early shouldn&#039;t happen, so why encourage vendors to ask for it.&nbsp; I think if anything the pool should be for buyers who have been scammed, and no vendor should touch it.<br />Be nice to your dealers, but never pity them or think they are worse off than you.&nbsp; And keep your self protected. , but don&#039;t make people pay for a buyer acct. especially if it is going straight to the vendors, the get our money by us purchasing from them. <br /><br />Also if this pool existed the dealer gets paid right away, so how does this help anything? (please let me know if I&#039;m looking at this incorrectly)

				On one side, paying for buyers accounts would be better for seller safety. However, it would probably significantly decrease the number of new people coming to the site.

				I&#039;m not a buyer, but for me paying for seller account is a serious restriction to start business. were from I can get those BTCs, chain of exchanges I do not know much about it. serious time consuming task to learn all related to exchanges questions. I would be glad to see if payment for&nbsp; seller acc can be charged form first sales.

				If Each Time I Bought something, I was given opportunity to Purchase some kind of Insurance ( if Transaction went belly Up, I would get all my BC&#039;s Back) I would do it. I would also be willing to Pay a set percentage of 1-5% for each Purchase. I&#039;m here to stay. If it means paying something, then I&#039;m cool with it as long as it&#039;s reasonable.

				This only works if the buyer is getting something for their &quot;membership&quot;, like a discount on every purchase.&nbsp; If the buyers uses their membership a lot, they come out ahead, if they don&#039;t, they come out behind.&nbsp; It works for Sam&#039;s Club, REI, and Costco.<br /><br />Maybe in this case, paying buyers never pay escrow; it&#039;s paid out of the pool.&nbsp; &quot;Free&quot; buyers always pay escrow.<br /><br />The problem lies within the complication of such a system.&nbsp; Simple is good.<br /><br />I went off on a tangent there.&nbsp; For me to pay, I would have to get something that people who don&#039;t pay don&#039;t get.&nbsp; Unless everyone paid.<br /><br />Tangent.

				If the sellers really want this Early release pool then just triple or quadruple the sellers account fee they pay when they sign up. It is getting ridiculous that the buyers should be the one to shoulder all the burden of paying and paying again just so the sellers can make more money. <br /><br />I have been around sites like this for years (yes the first site like this was set up around 2002 - 2003 and is still around today) and they only survive if the burden is split between buyer and sellers. If a buyers account fee is put in place I would never pay it!

				i agree to some degree with an initial cost for buyers. start with read only and pay an amount to start the buying process. this will increase the trust in buyer from the seller perspective.&nbsp; (that&nbsp; will really suck for people who forget passwords or have to make new account for technical reasons!)&nbsp; im all for reducing the ever rising %&nbsp; for the small buyer. i wouldnt think a a lot of buyers are bulk.&nbsp; seems like vendors get sketchier in bulk shipments.&nbsp; this to me is a mirror image of how the middle class carries the economical system..
