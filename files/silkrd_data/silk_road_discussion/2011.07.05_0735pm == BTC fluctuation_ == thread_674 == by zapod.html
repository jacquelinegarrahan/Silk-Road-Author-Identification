				I&#039;m sure this has been covered before, but is there anything to be done about the delay between price in BTC on our listings and the real rate of exchange? I priced one tab at 10.1, but now it&#039;s at 8.6: while that dollar may not seem like much, considering I just sold out of a sheet, that&#039;s 100$ that I&#039;m not going to be getting :-/

				i thought that when you look at the bottom of the sr page it shows a bitcoin average but when you actually do a order it uses the exact mtgox current price. i know i read that somewhere.

				Nothing other than you building in some kind of margin that allows for some movement.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of rough - the recent steady depreciation has hurt since I had about 6 orders out before it started.

				lvlbrained: I don&#039;t think it does, as my prices in USD (AND BTC!) were about 1USD lower than when I had made them :-/

				yeah, the calculation for pricing is weird.&nbsp; When the huge drop happened in June (not the hack crash, just the 30-to-ten crash), my prices wouldn&#039;t even come close to keeping up with the declining BC price, even on a rolling 24-hour period.&nbsp; When prices were recovering the next day they still wouldn&#039;t catch up, and there was a good 25% of arbitrage in there.<br /><br />The calculation for your listing is a little strange too.&nbsp; If you edit a price it edits at the BC value when you actually listed it, so you might refresh to your listing and see the price is still higher or lower (sometimes by a lot) than you intended.
