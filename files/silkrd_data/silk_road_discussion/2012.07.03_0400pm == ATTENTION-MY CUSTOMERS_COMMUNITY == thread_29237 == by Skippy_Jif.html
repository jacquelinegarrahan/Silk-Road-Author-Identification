				I just wanted to say first that this is the kindest group of people I have met. It means a great deal of respect that so many people are willing to go out of their way to wish my grandmother well. I truly mean that from the bottom of my heart!<br /><br />She isnt doing too well and the doctors say that the cancer has metastasized to her head. We don&#039;t know how long she has if this stageof treatment doesn&#039;t work. She has lost a lot of weight and her mental capacity has declined to the point she hardly recognizes loved ones. I am still optimistic though.<br /><br />With the above being said orders will be slower going out, but they will still get out fairly quick. If youre are in a rush and need EXPRESS i will do the best i can, but i cant promise it will be shipped that day. More likely the following day because i need time to package and get to the post offfice before closing. I apologize for the inconvience. I am trying to answer to all the communities PMs, but my time is limited. I will be answering during my lunch breaks and at night. So, please bare with me during this time(I know SR COMMUNITY will).<br /><br />Thank you guys &lt;3
