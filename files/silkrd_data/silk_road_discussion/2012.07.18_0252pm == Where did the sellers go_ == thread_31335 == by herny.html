				wtf is OP and others talking about?<br />i don&#039;t know about other drugs but there&#039;s now 1000+ cannabis listings up.<br />when i joined SR a few months ago it was way less.<br />SR has been groing constantly, and the rise of the bitcoin price shows that more and more people are getting into cryptocurrency and sooner or later they will hear about silkroad.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think any actual vendor or client here will take the random speculations from the gawker article serious.<br />it&#039;s just so they have something to tell that people on clearnet find interesting. if anything, this article will send MORE people to SR, just like their last one did.<br /><br />not every vendor has a constant supply of goods and silkroad vendors get busted just like regular vendors do - when they buy their stuff. I don&#039;t think LE ever found a vendor through SR.<br />when your favorite vendor isn&#039;t available at the moment just find a new one.
