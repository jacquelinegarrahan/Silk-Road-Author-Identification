				Sounds like you want to give up the fight and give it to another platform.<br />That does not seem the right way to me...<br /><br />A well known vendor has created a SILKROAD FORUM BACKUP using the same forum machine.<br /><br />Please PM me for details as the hidden URL is only posted in the vendors roundtable right now!<br />I will answer each PM as fast as possible.

				Well damn the forums for eating my post. It was lengthy.<br /><br />Summary.<br /><br />I applaud any and all work done towards keeping up the impetus we need to keep together. I simply joined, said hello, and left. I did not take the time to peruse the user list. If Happy is over there....it saddens me a bit, because his less than exemplary behavior in this time is accruing him bad forum karma which makes me ill at ease with his posting style.<br /><br />That said. I will not poopoo anyone&#039;s ideas and applaud people who know more about software programming than me doing the good work.<br /><br />I will land where the portion of the community whom I am most comfortable with lands. I am hoping that is somewhere together eventually, but I accept that may not be the case. In the meantime I applaud people who are trying.<br /><br />Cheers.

				I&#039;ve been conversing with some refugees from the Official Spare Coins Thread over on Sheep Marketplace and I&#039;m afraid that their forum software is terrible. The market there is also confusing and very poorly explained. It all looks very nice but, Goddess, it&#039;s clunky to actually use.

				Lib - good call on that man, thanks. <br /><br />And Cirrus is right.. please don&#039;t be delusional about these forums being up forever. Either whoever paid for them will stop, and ohyeah.. there&#039;s the small issue of that the same seizure notice posted on the forum main URL (I personally did NOT see it.. but multiple people seem to have seen it) and then it was taken down. <br /><br />Please do not be delusional.. these forums are not only being watched by LE up the wazoo, but also probably compromised by them.

				I have made it on to the BMR forums same name as here. I am also testing out Sheep and the deepbay... The deepbay is fucking dead. So speculation how long do you think these forums will last and remain active? and why do you speculate they were not taken down with the site?

				Firstly, why is people giving Liberatas so much shit? Only for himself and Cirrus there would be no Mods left and the reason I loved SR so much was because it felt like a real community where everyone&#039;s input was acknowledged. You guys are the only ones that stayed while DPR&#039;s ship is sinking and deserve a bit more appreciation.<br /><br />So i decided to try out Sheep Market first because after looking at BMR I was instantly put off by the interface. Its not very user friendly and it&#039;s just not nice to look at. I quite like Sheep though. The interface is very similar to SR and it is much much quicker. I have not seen too many veteran vendors over there yet but my go to weed gut The Herbalist was there straight away so I was really happy. Placed my first order on Saturday and it arrived today (1 Day). I have seen a lot of people freaking out because they think there is no escrow on Sheep. I can tell you that they do have escrow, otherwise I would not have ordered.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t given BMR a proper chance so I am gonna buzz over there now to have a proper look and to see what vendors have migrated there. One thing I really don&#039;t like it the fact these sites sell guns, but hopefully in the future they will get rid of this. <br /><br />Silk Road being brought down has only publicised the fact you can get anything you want online. I am very intrigued to see what happens to DPR. Personally I believe that he didn&#039;t take out hits on people. I live in the UK and even I know what the Feds are like. Very pleased that he pleaded not guilty, a very interesting case lies ahead. It has been made even more interesting since his mam came out and said she has admissible evidence that DPR didn&#039;t order the hits.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks again to the Mods for sticking around. Are you&#039;s planning to move over to BMR or Sheep? Maybe even get SR 2.0 going? Well whatever you guys do, It has been a pleasure to have you here.<br /><br />Stay safe my friends,<br /><br />ProEvo

				Why are people going to Sheep??&nbsp; It has no history, no escrow, etc.....&nbsp; For all we know this is a setup by the FEDs to collect more information..&nbsp; If it is, they will have all addresses and see all transactions.&nbsp; Pretty easy bust for the FEDs.
