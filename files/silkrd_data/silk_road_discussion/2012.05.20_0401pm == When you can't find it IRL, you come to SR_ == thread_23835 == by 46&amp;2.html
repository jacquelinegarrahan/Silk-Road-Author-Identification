				IRL for weed and hash, SR for other drugs.. Where i live is very difficult to find good MDMA or Ket outside the club or rave scene, and impossible to find drugs like 2C-X, mescaline or some RC.. Hereabouts there&#039;s only good or shitty coke and perhaps H, but this is not my drugs of choice unlike the others mentioned above&nbsp; ;)

				Lack of real life hookups is what brought me here.&nbsp; I was always at least one middle man away from product meaning I had to wait for my friends to get around to buying drugs.&nbsp; Buncha real life slackers. <br /><br />Now I buy from the dealer, and if I plan ahead I never run out.&nbsp; Life is good on the Road.

				No reason to shop IRL anymore. I only have one hookup for decent weed and the stuff on here is both cheaper and better than it anyway. Everything else is impossible for me to find and even if I did it would likely be of shit quality for too much money.

				I use opiates. The prices here are crazy compared to irl. Good news is I have an abundunce of coin, so paying a premium and not fucking with people is the plus here.<br /><br />I pay 25 @ most for a r irl, on sr you pay 36+ shipping, so its kinda overpriced but at least I dont have to worry about getting ripped off as much. <br /><br />Im watching our h prices fall, I will probably start buying more h when prices get a little lower. I think 300 for a gram of tar is a ripoff.

				I moved to the country for a job. Then I lost my local hook-up for Heroin and was stuck driving an hour and a half back to the city. I had to score off the streets at that point and one day when I got back to my car after an unsuccessful pass through the park I said to myself, &quot;there has to be a better way&quot;. <br />So I sat in my car and ran a few google searches for &quot;online drug sales&quot; or something like that, and a news article about SR came right up. SR completely blew my expectations away.

				I always check the quality &amp; price IRL first. Then check what it is on SR. 90% of the time SR is significantly cheaper AND better quality so I just wait a week or 2 for good product then all my friends are amazed at how good the stuff i get is compared to local sources

But I totally agree with you on how overpriced the majority of other things are on here. My guess is there are a lot of really rich or desperate people on here that can actually afford the prices those greedy pill pushers set on their wares. Pretty sad if you ask me. :-\

				Lol Bing is far from overpriced here and so is MDMA. The quality of Bing I get from here would cost around £110 a g in the U.K but I get 2.5g for about £150. Them sort of prices are enough to give me a stiffy any day. MDMA is the same, I get 1g for say £35 when I would have to pay £45 IRL to get the same quality. <br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a deal, it&#039;s a steal, it&#039;s sale of the fuckin&#039; century!&quot;

				The reason everything is cheaper here than in IRL is that i live in Norway and then everything is shit expensive including drugs.. One gram of mdma cost about 1500 nok which is 150£.. Prescription pills i have noticed is very expensive on here though.

				Pot2Peer is my goto for weed now.<br /><br />SR for psychs, so far it&#039;s all been A+ from SR, which IRL I&#039;m usually disappointed in psychs more often than not. Poorly grown shrooms are the norm for local here, majority of LSD is weak, or fake in several cases, and when I did find a legit hookup the prices and quality were always up and down from the same guy even. 25i I had never even heard of til SR, and DMT I had been searching for years and never found anyone local to have, only time I did it was with a lawyer in Miami.<br /><br />IRL I still get adderall, because the prices here are laughable. I don&#039;t delve into prescriptions much at all but many of my friends do so I know the availability and prices since I often find them for them, nearly all on SR are vastly overpriced though.<br /><br />Xtc I can get slightly cheaper here unless I buy in bulk, as I&#039;d trust an SR vendor more than I&#039;d trust my xtc connect, and MDMA locally is usually cut, fake, and always hard to find either way.

				I came here for the acid since i have to get in a different city then i live in amd worry about it being legit or not. First time i got it was amazing the second time it wasn&#039;t the best. Might have been my fault for not storing it correctly during the summer. Anyway here I know what i&#039;m getting is legit. If i buy it in bulk its a great bit cheaper.<br /><br />I started to read up on stuff on this website a bit more then i had read about before. So now i&#039;m wanting to get mda,2c-b,25i and more . I love this site cheers to all :-)

				The most dangerous aspect of drug use is the violence involved when someone tries to rip another off, and getting product that isn&#039;t what your told or is cut with something else causing an OD or other unintended effects.

				i get skunk IRL cos its cheaper than here and 9 times out of 10 is good quality. occasionally its soaking wet but shit happens and i&#039;m not comfortable with having anything that smelly coming through the post, regardless of vacuum sealed or not. everything else (including hash) comes from the Road, sick of paying £100 for a gram of &#039;blinding gear&#039; when it obviously ain&#039;t. and i&#039;m out of the E circle now so i don&#039;t know where to get any IRL

				Hey! Any other old fuck meth heads still alive out there? I just finished close to 10 grams of 4 or 5 different vendors on &#039;The Road&#039; and not a single shard felt like the meth I always got on the street. What&#039;s that you say? You know, &#039;smash you directly in the groin area&#039; make you want to fuck your door jam if necessary because you just HAVE too! <br /><br />None of those 10 grams from every US and 1 Euro vendor I tried had it. Most were beautiful - some were HUGE beautiful chunks of shards - not one single one felt like anything but my wanting to do back flips - not out of fun but because it was 100% SPEEDY and 0% &#039;euphoria&#039; and &#039;aphrodisiac&#039; feeling meth. <br /><br />I did accidentally stumble upon a small (maybe .25 gram) shard right in front of my 7/11 store that when I did it - well I couldn&#039;t wait to get out of my pants. I didn&#039;t feel like cleaning my God damned house! I did feel like doing back-flips, but out of euphoric joy. Unfortunately those 2 young ladies have never surfaced again or I would not buy any meth on &#039;The Road&#039;. I love this place! I love it, I love it, I LOVE IT! But I don&#039;t smoke that shit so that might be why I continue to follow 5x5 reviews of stuff only to find it&#039;s good running crap and that&#039;s it! <br /><br />If I want to clean my fucking house brothers and sisters, I&#039;ll pop a couple of my 20mg Adderall and not blow several thousand dollars thinking any second I might rape my door jam or something only to find yet another disappointing sample of SR &#039;go fast&#039;. <br /><br />No to &#039;go fast&#039;! YESSSS to &#039;go fuck&#039;. I don&#039;t know what else to say or even where to say it. <br /><br />Thanks for your time - times and I hope you find what you&#039;re looking for here. I have not!<br /><br />:(&nbsp; :(&nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp; ???

				I buy my weed from friends. Everyone has weed, buying weed on SR is only for those that want very good weed that isn&#039;t locally available, imo.<br /><br />On the other hand I buy almost everything else here. I&#039;ve bought street molly and xtc, and the molly was decent and the xtc was ho-hum. I bought street acid once but didn&#039;t get to try it, so no comment there. I&#039;ve been given other drugs by friends, but they were all prescription meds so commenting on quality is pretty useless.<br /><br />I also shop around greynet RC vendors but usually the service and quality here is better. Strangely, the &quot;shadier&quot; site is the most trustworthy most of the time!

				Well you cant beat the MDMA prices on here. Where I live (Eastern US), Molly is $90-$120 per gram. If you ask me, that&#039;s fucking ridiculous when you can get vastly cleaner stuff on the road. I only have 3 transactions, but so far this place has been a lot better in terms of quality than alot of the stuff I&#039;ve had IRL. All hail Silk Road!

				I make a judgement call, usually.&nbsp; If it&#039;s something I can wait for, and I can&#039;t easily get IRL, then I pull the trigger on the road.&nbsp; If I need it now, and obviously if I can get it IRL, then I&#039;ll do that.&nbsp; Mostly for things I would &quot;commonly&quot; use.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then there&#039;s more obscure substances--things that simply aren&#039;t available in our area, and have historically been hard to find in our area, or hard to get quality.&nbsp; SR saves the day in those cases, because the quality is pretty much assured (if you buy smart), and it gives us a chance to introduce certain things to our local community and social circles.&nbsp; Acid, in particular, comes and goes and is very volatile in terms of availability and quality.&nbsp; From the right vendors, SR provides a much better choice.<br /><br />Of course, for the not so common items, I pretty much always investigate the substances online and on SR before I look to get it IRL.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t hurt, and it sometimes provides me with a good alternative price-wise when I have my heart set on something in particular.

Weed is rather abundant here, and it&#039;s always dank, so I really don&#039;t have much of a use for SR when it comes to marijuana. However, I prefer psychedelics - drugs which are very uncommon here. I&#039;d be lucky to even get my hands on some &quot;LSD&quot;, and even then it&#039;s probably just a very low dosage of it, or not even LSD at all (hence why I put the quotes).<br /><br />tldr; I buy my psychedelics on SR - they&#039;re very rare where I live. However, weed is abundant here so I have no use for buying it online ;D .

				HAHA Limetless that is hilarious about Bill Gates and to be honest he did steal most of&nbsp; his early work which made him the big bucks like DOS and other aspects of Windows OS which is a horrible OS if I do say so myself. When I read your comment I&nbsp; just pictured him walking in apple matrix style with his cardigan and pulling out two DE .50s and laying waste to his competition..

				weed quality has plummeted in my area lately - a rather large US city - and hookups are getting less and less reliable.

				Any drugs in my area are piss poor quality. I can get weed anywhere but i choose SR because nothing here can compete with the quality (and sometime its actually cheaper on SR). Coke round these parts is just terrible.

				sr provides this connectivity which was only a dream or fantasy to us who remember 20 years ago, and what it meant to network and search and hunt for that connection and connections to score weed, etc. old habits die hard and irl connections have obvious perks, but this alternative avenue to score is awesome.

				I can get my ganja and shrooms in real life but I wasn&#039;t able to obtain LSD until SR, never really have been around people who ever even talked about the stuff.
