				And i&#039;d agree on this. <br /><br />You can look at the SR bust as a big win for DEA, FBI and all, but is it really?<br /><br />It seems that about 1.2 BILLION worth of merchandise changed hands trough this website in 2 years time before it got busted. Let that figure drop - that is 1.200.000.000 dollars. And it basically got busted mostly due to some errors made in the beginning when the site was just a pilot project of sorts. Added to that was a technical fluke that lead to the whole assassination deal (if that proves to be true)<br /><br />So yes, I firmly believe this will be done again soon, and be done better. Given the media exposure to the darknet and natural growth of SR and similar site, i believe a good, secure, platform could easily make a full million in transactions in the next year. Even with much lower commissions that we had on SR, this is an enormous financial opportunity - taking only 1% commission is good for $10 million in revenue a year. <br /><br />That might take a million dollars to pull off, but by the end of the year anyone that really gets it right could be raking in millions in profit. Obviously there are talented people that are really, really good with cryptography and anonymity that will pull that off for that kind of pay. <br /><br />Lets be real here: the next person to pull it off will do things better, and probably be enjoying cigars in cuba from the profits, i&#039;m sure they&#039;ll take bitcoins there some day :D

				They will never be able to stop the free market! It&#039;s like playing wack-a-mole, once you hit one a few more pop up right away. Good luck fighting a losing battle, sorry ass scrubs. Get real fucking jobs. How about you go after rapists, thieves and murders, instead of people that simply want to get high and left alone. Fucking fascist, neo-nazi, police state we live in.

				Remember when Napster was taken down. It was such a victory for the recording industry stopping people from downloading free music.

The main thing though was that Napster, whilst peer to peer for transactions, had a centralized architecture, single point of failure which was easy for it&#039;s opponents to decapitate. Bam! One day a hundred thousand napster fans were left high and dry. Sound familiar?<br /><br />But the cat was out of the bag, the infrastructure was still in place and importantly the fancy had been tickled and the demand was there, so learning from mistakes a true de-centralized peer to peer model was born. 10 years later it&#039;s almost unstoppable with more users than ever. <br /><br />Peer to peer, decentralized, highly anonymized - possibly layered on TOR but possibly big enough to be it&#039;s own network, Internet optional. It&#039;s coming.<br /><br /><br />

				The napster analogy is interesting. They had their design flaws too, which ultimately allowed the network to be shut down.<br /><br />But moving forward a decade in technological progress, we still download our music, movies and tv shows through torrents on a huge scale. Despite efforts to first take down trackers, and after that indexing sites, this system is still going strong and there is little sign of its downfall (without a lack of replacement).<br /><br />It mostly is a matter of someone taking a bullet to prove vulnerability, and someone else stepping up and presenting a solution that no longer has this vulnerability. <br />
