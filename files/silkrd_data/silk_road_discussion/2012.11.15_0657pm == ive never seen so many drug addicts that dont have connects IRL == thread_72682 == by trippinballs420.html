				I can get everything I NEED in real life. The quality however don&#039;t come close to the what you can find on the silk road!<br />Real life drug dealers (in my experience) are shit! The quality of the drugs they sell is way lower, they are always weirdos and there never on time.

				Sorry to disappoint you, OP, but there are some cities where the drugs you&#039;re looking for aren&#039;t flowing, especially if you haven&#039;t the right contacts. And indeed, if you want quality...I don&#039;t see the point of putting my money in some dirty schwag, if you can get amazing buds on SR. That being said, I&#039;m not complaining about the site being down, just a lil&#039;bit about the lack of information here.;)

				i understand that, but every drug addict i know IRL is resourceful as fuck, as was i when i was in my junkie days, but ive never seen so many addicts not able to find their DOC nearby where they are and most have a stash of subs or benzos in case they ever cant pick up or get money. im just saying its kinda ridiculous. people dont really have a right to complain, as much as we&#039;d all like to believe that SR is a legitimate business, the fact of the matter is its not. its not like you are investing your money with bernie madoff who is supposed to be doing legal things with it but instead robs everyone blind, we are dealing with a drug marketplace that ships illegal substances over country and state borders. you should understand that you are taking quite a risk getting them shipped to you anyways.<br /><br />DPR is not held to a standard by some government agency, to put it very simply he is one of the largest middlemen in the drug trade today. this isnt a legitimate corporation. hell if i was DPR id be chillin on a beach on some island that doesnt have extradition, not sitting in a basement with a bunch of computer shit 24/7. dont do illegal shit if you dont understand you have the risk of losing your freedom and any money/assets you have that are tied up in the illegal shit.<br /><br />while i would like an update from DPR im not gonna bitch about it, even if he did get popped by LE who gives a fuck. like damn that sucks, guess ill need to find somewhere else to get my acid, but it doesnt make or break me. i have shrooms growing in my room so its not that big of a deal to me.

				I totally agree with all you said, SR isn&#039;t granted for sure. But I had discoreved some of the best weeds I&#039;ve ever smoked on this site, and thanks to SR I also had the possibility to get my hand on acid and MDMA for the first time :) My point is, I sincerely hope that nothing&#039;s going wrong with DPR and/or the staff, and that we will see the road again soon :)
