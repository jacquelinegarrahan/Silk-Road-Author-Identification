				Hmmm that&#039;s strange there is people getting on, as I&#039;ve just tried again and got the same capcha as when I tried a couple of hours ago and it&#039;s still just going to a screen saying.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;We are currently doing server maintenance. Please check back in 6 to 8 hours.&quot;<br /><br />EDIT: So actually this was all my bad and stupidity, I just bought a new laptop and had just installed Tor on it didn&#039;t have the SR address anywhere but knew it was on wikipedia used this one http://silkroadv5p5cbl6.onion/ which I found on there, got to what I thought was the SR page and it asked for my pin number as well as my login details, thought nothing of it as haven&#039;t been on site for so long and last thing I heard was about a scam with fake listings or something to that effect, so thought it might be an extra bit of security.&nbsp; Anyway I filled the whole thing in pin and all and was redirected to the &quot;..server maintenance&quot; page, but just now as I seen nobody else having the problem thought better check it out and low and behold yup it&#039;s a phishing link posted on wikipedia, luckily I&#039;ve managed to get on site and change my password before I was locked out.&nbsp;
