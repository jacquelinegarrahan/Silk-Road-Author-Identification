Just don&#039;t get thinking that means you can start buying grams of LSD....you are fucked if you are caught with that. :P

I am more concerned about the spiritual well-being of fellow SR user Gary Oak and just want to try and cheer him up a bit here. Also forgive me if I sound like a&nbsp; hippie : I am actually not so big on that &quot;peace and love&quot; tofu mumbo jumbo. In fact, I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to shoot any motherfucker that gets in my face.<br /><br />Bro: consider yourself lucky to live in the psychedelic&nbsp; mecca that is San Francisco. I had the privilege of living there for a few years until the big earthquake in &#039;89. It freaked me out so much that I moved as far away as I could from the San Andreas Fault. It&#039;s a decision I&#039;ll always regret and I have many fond memories of my time there. Part of the allure of living by the Bay is the fact that some day, without any notice, that whole city is going to slide into the ocean. Considering it&#039;s fragile location it&#039;s inevitable.<br /><br />It is def the most liberal and tolerant city in the U.S.A.: consider the ethnic and cultural diversity and the various unique communities scattered within it: San Francisco is Jeffersonian democracy in action. If your a straight guy there are more single women available, if your gay you can be open about it, and it is very supportive of drug users and harm reduction programs (including medical marijuana). It&#039;s no coincidence that psychedelic pioneer Alexander Shulgin lives just an hour drive outside of the city.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I am really sorry to hear about your depression Gary Oak, but I would personally rather admire the awesome scenery of the Golden Gate bridge than jump off of it. Forgive me for making an assumption here but you may want to reevaluate your drug of choice b/c if your whole reason for living is based on one particular substance it sounds like you might&nbsp; have an addiction. Speaking from my own personal experience I can say with a degree of certainty that addictions are very seldom life affirming.<br /><br />You might want to sample all the various psychedelics that are readily available in San Francisco or here on SilkRoad particularly the organic ones like magic mushrooms,mescaline, and DMT . Take one of these and go for a walk in Golden Gate Park on a sunny day or trip around Chinatown and North Beach.These substances may help facilitate or reawaken an awareness of the beauty that surrounds us everyday but which we might have forgotten and become disconnected from. A few good trips just might be the perfect prescription to help cure you of the what sounds like a heavy case of the blues.<br /><br /><br />Now regarding the actual topic of this thread re: the anxiety of waiting for packages. Just use some common sense and space your orders out accordingly so they don&#039;t attract too much attention. Having a dozen small boxes from Amsterdamn all arrive at the same time is def going to raise some red flags with the Postal Service.<br /><br />I was actually considered ordering a carton of cigarettes from Moldovia (?) selling on SR for a mere 5 Btc ( a carton goes for about $100. U.S. where I live)&nbsp; a week ago but&nbsp; thought that this obvious big bulky item entering the country would def be noticed by Customs (who would apply punitive custom taxes thus defeating the purpose of the purchase) and would be a major heat score. It would totally compromise my mailing address...so needless to say, and despite the temptation, I won&#039;t be buying those any time soon. <br /><br />**User&#039;s Don&#039;t Lose Drugs!!**

I&#039;ve ordered plenty illegal stuff that could get my head cut off in these part way before I was on SR. I don&#039;t think my mail services gives much of a shit or very many of them would know what weed smells like. What I am afraid of though is LE operations against this site and them tipping off my local PD.

				Yea, i really shouldnt have sweated it, all my orders arrived at once, and not a single fuck was given that day. I think its easy to overestimate LE, They have a lot more going on than to worry about shit like this.

				To me, I don&#039;t care about the chance of losing the money. It&#039;s only paper. The chance of getting busted sux. But I got that deniability thing down to a tee. And I know about asking for my lawyer and the bullshit that cops come up with to try to scare you.

				After several months of success on the road my confidence has definitely gone up, whether that be a good thing or a bad thing. I still do find myself stalking the fuck out of my mailman though.<br /><br />Sellers depend on high feedback in order to increase profits/gain new buyers on this site so naturally they are going to go the extra mile to make sure your package is shipped stealth, and in a speedy manor. That makes the &quot;freaking out&quot; phase a little shorter. I can&#039;t think of anyone in their right mind who would NOT be scared ordering illegal substances in the mail. Blending in with all the other business and bullshit mail is what SR vendors do best! <br /><br />But I&#039;m sure as many others, I am addicted to the rush of the entire thing now. There&#039;s no going back. This is the future!

				Been doing a lot of thinking about this subject and I have come to the conclusion that we ARE making a difference... look at the LE who patrol this site... investigating us... trying to bust us... they are making LITTLE or NO difference in the grand scheme of things... yes some of us will be busted... could be me... don&#039;t really care to be honest. I mean i would love to do this for 20+ years and stack up tons of green backs and retire but I am not stupid... I have already done time on some really smart crimes so I KNOW what LE is capable of but when you look at the big picture, the population (other than LE) will continue on long after I am gone from this planet. People WANT to be free... it is who we are and that desire will ALWAYS override the desire of the Government to repress us. The ID, the EGO, that part of us that makes us feel special, the part of our brain that makes us think we are the only ONE who understands needs to be controlled... we need to work as a force to overcome LE and continue this work onward. Some of us will go down, we will be martyred for our efforts... hopefully future generations will honor us for the efforts we have put forth not only for our work but for the liberties we have sacrificed being the first..<br /><br />Look beyond the here and now folks... look at the freedom SR provides... don&#039;t admire the site... admire the cause... and carry it on... at all costs.

				One thing to do is order lots of &quot;legitimate&quot; (I hate being forced to use that word like that!) stuff from lots of places. Near, far, signature required, no signature.<br />Be sure and gab it up with the postal worker when signing about all of the things your into and all of the purchases you make and how long you&#039;ve been waiting for this to come and all of the stuff you&#039;ve ordered or bought on ebay or whatever.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t mention anything illegal......of course.<br /><br />Then they &quot;know&quot; you and like most humans, especially those seeking cushy government jobs,&nbsp; won&#039;t think twice about it again.

				Ordered something from sr for the first time today, and even though the customs worry me a a bit it&#039;s not delivered too my address anyway, and the slight chance of a monetary loss is obviously a risk i was willing to take the minute i clicked buy.. I wouldn&#039;t be worried even if i ordered to my own address either since i would just deny i know something about it

				I&#039;m pretty new as well, and I can tell you I did experience some of what you&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; I have an anxiety disorder and my anxiety works in mysterious ways, often times surprising me that I find/don&#039;t find something to make me anxious.&nbsp; But the first time I used a cash deposit to a bitcoin exchange, I got this feeling of dread right afterwards.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t shake the feeling that I might be ripped off, really.&nbsp; At that point, there was nothing to fear from LE.&nbsp; But, I just swallowed a couple Klonopin, and hoped for the best.&nbsp; <br /><br />Surely enough, the transfer worked and I was overjoyed when I saw my SR account balance rocket up.&nbsp; Since then, I haven&#039;t been too anxious about SR at all.&nbsp; I&#039;m a medicinal Cannabis user in a non-medical states with little to no friends with drug connections.&nbsp; So to be honest, I had a shit load of anxiety about just being able to find the damn stuff!&nbsp; I&#039;ve found SR effectively removes this anxiety for me, so that&#039;s awesome.&nbsp; Stay safe, be smart, keep cautious.

				Sure, we all do, to one degree or another.&nbsp; I avoid paranoia, and fight off preoccupation with secondary aspects of these transactions that aren&#039;t really illegal.&nbsp; Some people get all caught up in trivial aspects, then neglect the simple basic and obvious advice to just not *tell* anybody else about it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like fooling with Tails and liberte linux and other digital doodahs, but I&quot;m not sure if any of that will ever really matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;But at the same time, I know there is one really dangerous thing I do do, which is give out my fucking address to a total stranger, and much as I study and attempt to find replacements for &#039;me,&#039; it&#039;s hard.<br /><br />It&#039;s not for the faint of heart, and I do operate on the theory that you should not do the crime if you cannot do the crime, but that is small comfort of if you are sitting in the holding tank in some loud crowded jail somewhere...on the other hand, life is short, nothing ventured nothing gained...

				Giving out my real name and address to a seller is like giving my business card to my street dealer.
