				So FE&#039;d early at the behest of an AA++ vendor and package hasn&#039;t arrived after 1 month. Yeah shame on sirlordvader for FE but I was confident. <br /><br />Anywho although they dont have to give me a refund I&#039;ve been polite all the way through the process and flicked them an email offering a solution and in the process asking for a 50/50 refund. <br /><br />Sound fair to peeps?

NEVER FINALIZE EARLY FOR ANY VENDOR, FULL STOP. SR Support WON&quot;T help you as they consider any finalized order a receipt of your package having arrived and you being satisfied with it all. Read up on the use of Escrow and in situations such as the one your in, the SR Resolution Center. Had you done so before placing an order, your 50/50 refund proposal might well have been accepted or decided upon by SR Support in the Resolution center. This is a perfect example to demonstrate the importance of following the guidelines set out by DPR. Why take a risk when there is the option to avoid that risk altogether.

				If your order hasn&#039;t arrived after a month, asking for a 50% refund sounds fair to me. FE has weakened your position but a courteous vendor would still consider your request.

				Like the others have said....never FE for any vendor or for any reason whatsoever! Always use escrow, it&#039;s there for your protection.
