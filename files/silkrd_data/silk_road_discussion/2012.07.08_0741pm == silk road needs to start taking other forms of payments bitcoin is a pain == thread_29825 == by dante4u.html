				No it doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Every illegal website that takes anything other than Bitcoins gets shut down very quickly or becomes fully of scammers and idiots. We have a certain level of intelligence, connoisseurship and quality here that goes hand in hand with Bitcoins.

				My thoughts are that this system works just fine for everyone involved.&nbsp; If some vendors or buyers are unhappy with the methods involved in using Silk Road, then they should (and probably already are) sell their goods through other avenues.&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s a pain, yes, but it&#039;s the price you pay for enhanced anonymity on the financial side of this service, and it&#039;s not *that* much of a pain once you get your payment system worked out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nothing is 100% safe and secure, but that&#039;s not really a good excuse to add a level of insecurity to the process.<br /><br />I say--Don&#039;t try to fix it if it ain&#039;t broke.

And you can&#039;t lock everything....not democratic. I can say what I think though because everyone can have their say.....always love being democratic. ;)<br /><br />But yeah OP, here is some basic algebra that I learned quite fast when I started dealing drugs and doing illegal shit for cash, it may help you -<br /><br />Profit = Illegal action + risk - risk-minimization. Risk minimization = risk x square route of not being retarded. Prison = Risk-minimization - Shit going tits up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asking for payments other than BitCoins is not compatible with any of those equations and therefore they are not compatible with anyone seeing a business with any longevity. <br /><br />That is all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>am not telling you to use other payments apart from bitcoin am saying sr could offer sellers other ways to get paid nothing wroug in that dont see how you could go to prison if other sellers took payments apart from bitcoin<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Really? You really think that DPR and co should allow another payment method on SR when pretty much every other payment method is infinitely easier to trace back to the seller and would thus be easier to take the site down? Is that REALLY what you are trying to say to me because only 5-O would suggest such a thing unless you are insanely uninformed. ANY other payment method would allow the tracing of those that receive it. You can trace people through BTC if you try hard enough and people don&#039;t use it properly. <br /><br />If you are some sort of Pork Product then you are a pretty shit one if I&#039;m gunna be straight with you. I mean come the fuck on, how dumb do you think we are? If you aren&#039;t a Pork Product then I think it would be best you do a bit of background reading before you express your opinions on how to improve SR because you don&#039;t have the right facts to hand. Do you not think that BTC is the sole form of payment for a reason or just because DPR + co think it&#039;s super-duper fun that way? If you do then it&#039;s a case of no-dice I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s security.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>am going to start selling on sr soon if i was a cop i could not do that<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wrong again, LE can do controlled sales and they do it all the time, they just need authorization to do so. Come on mate, you need to seriously sharpen up if you intend to sell here.
