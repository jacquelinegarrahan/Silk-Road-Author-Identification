				I was able to get the main page to load ONCE today also, after about 10 tries. However, there is definitely a problem and to assume that Tor is the problem doesn&#039;t fit the symptoms I&#039;m seeing. As I mentioned, I did get the main page to load ONCE, after SEVERAL tries. Yet I wasn&#039;t able to follow any links and all subsequent attempts to load any pages on the site are failing. (With way more failed attempts than I could possibly count.) Yet the forums are a totally different story, as well as every other site (either clear or hidden) that I&#039;m visiting via Tor. So, that means like a 99.999% failure rate for trying to load http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/ and 0% failure rate for all other domains accessed via Tor. That pretty much makes it apparent that Tor, per se, isn&#039;t really the issue here.<br /><br />I suppose it&#039;s also worth mentioning (though I see there&#039;s already a thread about it)... the one time I was able to get the site to load I noticed the BTC:USD exchange rate was way off, and Silk Road was valuing bitcoins at less than half of the rest of the internets. And I know this is not directly on-topic, but it just seems relevant in the sense that it points to some issues with the site itself, rather than Tor.<br /><br />Anyway, just to be sure, and out of sheer desperation, I tried the many suggestions offered here in the forums: like changing identities, trying new routes through Tor, restarting Tor, reinstalling Tor, and even the ubiquitous &quot;reboot&quot;. All to no avail.<br /><br />From the emerging pattern of sporadic &amp; scattered connectivity, this feels kind of like a DoS attack. Or maybe the site made the news again, in a big way. Hopefully it&#039;s nothing more serious.

				I Yesterday I had this issues, but I just reloaded everything and it worked great. I have done everything I can think of and still have been able to log in 1 time out of about 30 attempts.. Obviously, the market is having an issue. (probably had somewhat of an issue this entire weekend) so, nothing to do except wait til its fixed.. Ill also keep trying all the tricks..
