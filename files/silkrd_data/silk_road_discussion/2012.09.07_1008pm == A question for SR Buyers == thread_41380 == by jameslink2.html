				I am going to start with a bit of an explanation. When you fan a vendor, the vendor can not see that you are a fan or even see his fan list. There is no way to make a special for fans or return customers, that only they can see, without sending a message to each person.<br /><br />So, as a buyer, would you object to a vendor sending out a message containing special hidden listings/sales? <br />Only to people who have bought from me in the past, not a blast to everyone.<br /><br />Would you consider it spam or a good thing?<br /><br />Thought it better to ask and get a community feel before I do something like this.<br /><br />Note: It was the suggestion of support that I message people with specials.<br /><br />

				Yeah I think that&#039;s a great idea. Its kinda like how some stores require club cards and you get deals.<br />What kind of products do you sell through SR?<br /><br />And if you do this, make sure to send me those special deals too ;)<br />-Pilot

				Or a compose pm to &quot;my fans&quot; option in the messages tab .Even though you don&#039;t know who has fanned you, they would all get the PM you sent.<br />nice idea jameslink

				I think its a good idea. I have fanned a few vendors before I realized there is no reason to do it, unless I am missing something.

				as a buyer, I don&#039;t mind it.&nbsp; I already have one vendor that I&#039;ve gotten messages from regarding sales.&nbsp; He rarely has listings, so its nice to get a heads-up when he has restocked

				i would really like that. shows the seller remembers me, was happy doing business with me and is now trying to establish a deeper customer relation. loving it!<br /><br />@ zero effect: if you didnt fan a vendor, you wont see his listings as he goes into stealth mode. he will just seem to have disappeared.

				I would like it too.&nbsp; I have, in fact, received 2 listings for &quot;fans only.&quot;&nbsp; In one case, I purchased.<br /><br />It can be time consuming to search the listings and sometimes you have to be quick before it&#039;s sold out.&nbsp; So, yes, I would see this as a convenience.

				This is a great idea. :)&nbsp; this is also what tony did right before he scammed everyone..<br /><br />I&#039;m sure since you won&#039;t be asking anyone to FE you won&#039;t have any issues with that though..<br /><br />Actually, maybe Tony just sent it to everyone who had purchased from him.. i don&#039;t remember if the &#039;fan&#039; option was implemented yet.<br /><br />Either way i&#039;m sure it will be a great success for you and i wouldn&#039;t be upset if a vendor offered me a deal.. :P<br /><br />Have a great day.

				I work with several vendors who do exactly this, and guess what... It works great! Customer loyalty is very important when it comes to the long term financial health of your business. This isn&#039;t spam, its targeted marketing, and is too personable to really be called an &quot;ad&quot; and more fitting to be called a &quot;loyalty program&quot;&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Anyway, you can think of those messy grammar/text viagra emails that some people get and wonder how they make any money at all (well if 1% of people are stupid, and many more than this are, then there is a big market if you are sending mass amounts). Now if your selling Viagra (sildenifil) as a vendor, then it is completely appropriate to send them a message for discounted viagra beause of their loyalty, and their likely interest in one or more of your products.<br /><br />Do it! And always do what you did here and ask us here on the forum for advice when implementing any new marketing or other plans that you are having doubts about.<br /><br /><br />Best of luck!

				Thanks for all the great reply&#039;s. I just wanted to make sure I was not about to Piss off my clients&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />For those that asked, I sell Magic mushroom spores and cultures. If anyone is interested in a copy of the message drop me a line on SR and Ill send you the special.<br /><br />

				Just want to agree with everyone that its a good idea. My biggest pet peeve with SR is lack of communication between vendors &amp; buyers so anything that helps this would be a good idea in my book. <br /><br />I would compare it to your regular IRL dealer tossing in an extra bit of product when they can.
