				It&#039;s not as simple as just hiring someone. DPR would need to find someone he can REALLY trust. If it were you would you hire just anyone for the job? You cant just go out and hire a professional programmers for your black market. + If your not talking about programmers, what can staff really do? Sure support is pretty slow but its not the biggest deal. While on the road, remember this is a luxury of the best sort, not a given, appreciate it for what it is :)

				If they were smart they would establish a multi tier support system with a ticket system. <br /><br />Experienced members like myself help newbies for free every day.&nbsp; Why not keep doing it for a small fee or support-for-credit on the site.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />No money out, no passwords or security issues .. . Lots of old timer members willing to help.&nbsp; Just no organization or management.&nbsp; Anyone can call themselves &#039;sr staff&#039;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Who would verify it anyhow?&nbsp; A few mods and admins ?

				A extra mod or two wouldn&#039;t hurt, if for no other reason than to keep on top of the spam posts.&nbsp; Also a 24 hour wait period for withdrawing BTC would help eliminate some scams, the most recent for example.

				The mod approval process is unbelievably stringent.<br /><br />The biggest problem DPR may have is finding people willing to open up THEIR info as wide as he requires to verify you<br /><br />He doesnt just make sure you&#039;re a legit online name ... he scours your true identity before he approves<br /><br />Peace

The best defense is knowledge and I hate to say it but those mostly being scammed are green as grass newbies who do not use these forums to educate themselves. If more people took the time to do some reading before jumping in at the deep end or being seduced by too good to be true offers there would be far fewer victims. The number of newbies finding their way to SR now is growing all the time and the sheer number of those who demand immediate gratification with no investment of time effort and energy to learn the ropes is also growing.<br /><br />READ READ READ READ and then READ some more!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Love your work samesame!! +1 for what you do. :) You are so right. The influx of new members who don&#039;t comprehend the consequences of being caught ordering drugs online is staggering!!&nbsp; THIS IS NOT A GAME and shouldn&#039;t be treated as such.&nbsp; The need to make a purchase today, right now, is a sign of immaturity and impatience ,an illustration of the sort of behavior conducive to life changing mistakes being made. <br />I&#039;ve come across some fantastic newbie&#039;s here on the Forum who are legitimately interested in learning how to safely use SR. Those guys should be encouraged as they are putting the effort in. Others feel as though they can join up and then immediately start a thread such as <br />&quot;Newbie here.&nbsp; What is bitcoin, how do I order, can I send stuff to my address. etc, etc.&quot; MESSAGE TO NEWBIES - Follow SSBD&#039;S advice.&nbsp; ;D

				I agree with Jediknight.<br /><br />I, personally would love to be hired.<br />In fact i cannot think of a more perfect career for me.<br />While i realize this is a long shot, a guy can dream cant he hahaha.<br />Theyre doing a great job as it is, but SR will only see growth.<br />Eventually we will need more admins or at least trusted soldiers.<br />I am learning all i can on my own every day all day, but id<br />love to be trained and be given certain duties on SR.<br />
