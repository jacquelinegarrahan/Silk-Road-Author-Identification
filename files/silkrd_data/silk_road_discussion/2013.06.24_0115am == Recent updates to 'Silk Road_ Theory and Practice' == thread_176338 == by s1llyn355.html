				There is a Silk Road guide, which is considered by some to be &#039;the&#039; definitive guide to SR.<br />It is entitled &#039;Silk Road: Theory &amp; Practice&#039;&nbsp; .. it&#039;s actually an excellent read... <br />you can find it here: http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road<br /><br />Why am i drawing your attention to this?<br />Well.. because it&#039;s been updated recently.. At the top of the article it tells us that the most recent<br />update was on the 19th of June.<br /><br />And what does it say ?<br />What interests me are two particular paragraphs in which the author seems <br />to be recommending attacks on SR.. <br /><br />&lt;quote&gt;<br />My belief is that SR can be taken down; however, I am not sure LE (law enforcement) has permission to use the tactics necessary - explaining the lack of suggested attacks or realistic attacks in the leaked FBI Bitcoin paper and summaries of the leaked Australian SR paper (respectively). My two suggested attacks are<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. DDoSing the SR site, rendering it unusable (and congesting the overall Tor network)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. fake buyer &amp; seller accounts leading up to a single large scam.<br /><br />Attack #1 would make the site simply unusable, and can be done on any address SR runs on since the address has to be widely known or how will the buyers &amp; sellers know where to go? This would require a few dozen nodes, at least, although I’m not actually sure how hard it is to DDoS a Tor hidden server. <br />Attack #2 would require a fairly substantial financial investment, but depending on how effective the final step is, may actually run at a profit. Repeated, this would massively destroy buyers’ trust in SR, especially since there are usually only a few hundred active sellers at any point. (pine, commenting on how the competing black-market Atlantis does in-browser encryption which I criticized as security theater &amp; Hushmail redux, points out the Eternal September version of this scenario: the more newbie buyers who are too lazy or arrogant to use PGP (~90% of users, according to the Atlantis administrators) the more attractive an attack on SR becomes to pick up all the buyer addresses being sent in the clear and the more feasible a mass raid becomes.) Fortunately, I don’t think LE is authorized to engage in cyberwar (#1) or mass entrapment &amp; fraud (#2) - and who knows, maybe SR could survive both. We’ll see.<br />&lt;/quote&gt;<br /><br />Attack #1 has already been suffered here.<br />Attack #2 might already be &#039;work in progress&#039;.. we don&#039;t know.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know when the quoted paragraphs were added to the article.<br />I have no access to the document history..&nbsp; so i can&#039;t diff the various versions.<br />Were they added before or after the DoS attacks suffered by SR ?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />The worst case scenario is that this is putting ideas into Officer Dibble&#039;s head.<br /><br />Attack #2 is worrying.&nbsp; If LE sign up with seller accounts.&nbsp; They can drag net <br />hundreds of buyers in one sweep within a very short time frame.<br />And then announce to the media that they&#039;ve dealt a crushing blow <br />to buyer&#039;s confidence in using SR.<br />Using PGP / GPG correctly will not save you if you&#039;ve used a <br />public key supplied by Officer Dibble to encode your name and address.<br /><br />We recently had a case of a new vendor, offering &quot;sweeties&quot; to children,<br />i.e offering free drug &#039;samples&#039; .. but only to buyers in the USA. <br />(Why?.. because it&#039;s too much trouble posting samples to Canada, Europe or Australia ?<br />Or because the DEA doesn&#039;t want the complication of prosecuting foreign<br />nationals ?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.. but in general.. odd behaviour from &#039;new&#039; vendors isn&#039;t<br />a good sign.<br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s a good idea for buyers to stick with the established, long term vendors.<br />i.e. those with over 6 months history here.&nbsp; &nbsp;And yes i know that this suggestion<br />disadvantages new,&nbsp; struggling vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp; But buyers should prioritise their own<br />security first.. let vendors look after their own businesses... you don&#039;t have to do <br />that for them. <br /><br />best wishes.. be safe.<br /><br />s1llyn355 :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m posting this on behalf of gwern, who is still trapped in the newbie forums: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176844.msg1270250#msg1270250">Quote from: gwern on June 24, 2013, 06:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&gt;&gt;&gt; Well.. because it&#039;s been updated recently.. At the top of the article it tells us that the most recent update was on the 19th of June.<br /><br />Yes; that update was for adding a link to my de-anonymizing of the active SR vendor Casey Jones (specifically, http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1gxiv7/srrelated_bitcoin_seizure/caoxlmg ).<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#039;t know when the quoted paragraphs were added to the article. I have no access to the document history..&nbsp; so i can&#039;t diff the various versions. Were they added before or after the DoS attacks suffered by SR ?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />You can check revisions in the Internet Archive: http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road The paragraphs in question were originally added 16 September 2012 (you can verify this in the first October archive: http://web.archive.org/web/20121006004502/http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road ), that is, before the DoS attacks. I&#039;m a little proud of &#039;calling it&#039; like that.<br /><br />I&#039;d also point out that later on I write:<br /><br />&quot;SR&#039;s administrator stated (http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/21/3675278/silk-road-operator-says-fail-whale-not-feds-brought-down-notorious) the downtime was due to &quot;record&quot; numbers of users; but if large numbers of legitimate users can accidentally take down the site, clearly a full-fledged DoS attack is feasible. A real DoS attack by a single attacker in April 2013 degraded access for a week and essentially blocked all access for ~2 days (http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1d569v/the_dread_pirate_roberts_discounts_all_items_on/), prompting SR to suspend its commissions for several days to encourage purchases.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				about Attack #2. You really believe that if in one month 50 new vendors appear, the whole SR community will try them??&nbsp; Why just not stick to your favourite vendors, established a long time on SR. How can you lose trust to SR if you do business with 5-10 vendors that you can even FE on the built trust.<br />Yes fake feedback from fake buyers, can push someone to try out. but here we have forum. If one order is not received we will know it.&nbsp; if more than one, then we will see a panic thread. <br />Dont forget escrow. This is what makes SR a place to trust.&nbsp; So in worst case the buyer will go to resolution center. and not do business with that vendor again.<br /><br />And I really believe that someone BIG is behind SR. someone lets this exist. And someone wanted me to meet Silk Road this year. Cause i have always been searching for buying drugs online. and all the results were these herbal legal buds shit. why now? <br />I am thankful to that though, my life has changed from the day i found SR. But i cant accept that this was not a result of manipulation. Really with all these huge amounts of drugs consumed globally, I dont understand why would LE focus on us, the buyers. I can only think one reason. To make us go to the streets again, to buy THEIR drugs.<br />Well, the streets have always been too dirty, now at last we have a chance to bring quality home. We will not anyone ruin this! <br />STICK TO YOUR FAVOURITE - PROFESSIONAL VENDORS.<br /><br />fuck the police - fucking robots

				here&#039;s a potential defense to Attack #2.<br /><br />There are certain groups of people who use (snail mail) remailing services.<br />Travellers.. divorcees.. debtors .. travelling salesman/businessmen <br />.. exchange students..&nbsp; agricultural workers..etc.<br /><br />For example .. some people take 6 or 12 months out of their career to go travelling in asia/africa/europe..etc<br />.. naturally, their address may change, month to month .. so they have their mail sent to a remailer<br />and periodically they instruct the remailer to send any newly arrived mail to address X or address Y.<br />Remailers are legitimate businesses offering a legitimate service to meet a real &#039;remailing&#039; need.<br /><br />.. i&#039;m sure you can see where this is going..<br /><br />The trick.. i think.. is to hire a remailer who is outside of the jurisdiction of your local police force.<br />...If you&#039;re in the USA.. perhaps there are options in equador, panama or&nbsp; mexico.<br />If you&#039;re anywhere in Europe.. try Turkey, Spain, Greece or Italy.<br />If Officer Dibble gets hold of your remailer&#039;s address in .. say... Athens, Greece.. <br />you can be sure Officer Dibble can&#039;t simply pop over there with a search warrant.<br />When you create an account with a suitable remailer.. <br />..use a fictitious name .. Miss Sally Ann Fields (or whatever)<br /><br />PROs<br />Vendors will now not know your real name, nor your real address.<br />Officer Dibble.. even if posing as a vendor.. will not know who you are, or where you live.<br /><br />CONs<br />Your SR mail may take considerably longer to arrive.&nbsp; <br />You may need to press that resolve button to buy extra postage time.<br /><br />What would be ideal.. is a (snail mail) remailing service which:<br />.. does not keep a history of account setting changes.. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (ie. does not store changes to your postal delivery address, or postal name)<br />.. which encrypts its database data ... (so the NSA can&#039;t &#039;hack&#039; their way in)<br />.. which allows payment via bitcoin/litecoin.. <br />.. provides a web interface that clients can log into, to see newly arrived mail..<br />.. allows clients to select, for each item of mail.. a forwarding name and forwarding address.<br />and..<br />.. which would notify you immediately that any inquiries were received from Officer Dibble.<br /><br />Possibly this ideal remailer already exists.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know..i haven&#039;t sufficient research to find out.<br />If this does exist..please tell me.. i will be very grateful !<br />If you do any research on snail mail remailers.. and make some interesting discoveries.. Please let me know.<br />(PM me or post a reply to this thread, or both)<br /><br />Whether this service exists or not.. if you&#039;re looking for a good business idea...<br />here&#039;s one that&#039;s guaranteed to have a wide field of customers.. and one <br />that will serve the SR community, and a libertarian agenda, in a significant way.<br /><br />Best wishes.. be safe!<br /><br />:-)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

LE.. might simply ignore foreign buyers .. because it&#039;s a legal and logistical headache<br />to prosecute foreign nationals).&nbsp; Good !<br /><br />But, as you have rightly pointed out.. <br />..there is a price to pay for this increased security:<br />1. your package now has to cross customs .. twice.<br />2. you have to pay the international shipping and remailer&#039;s fees.<br />there&#039;s also another cost.. which is the increased delivery time..<br />(it could turn days into weeks)<br /><br />There are pros.. and there are cons.. but this is a valid defense to Attack #2.<br /><br />A simpler and cheaper precaution.. is to stay away from new vendors and<br />.. i personally... view any vendor that says &#039;USA only&#039; with suspicion.<br />From a jurisdictional point of view, that&#039;s exactly what LE (posing as a vendor) would say.<br /><br />Best wishes.. be safe.<br /><br />:-)<br />

Lets start with attack #1.<br /><br />While DDOS attacks are common place, and performing one on a tor hidden service is not impossible, it can be defended against as we have seen. SR has suffered more than one major DDOS and manged to keep the site alive. A government sponsored DDOS could take down SR but SR has many avenues of communication including reddit. SR would simply change servers and url&#039;s. Should the attack continue the responsible nodes would be identified and ignored. Should the government continue an lengthy attack on SR, other markets are standing by to receive customers. <br /><br />Attack #2<br /><br />The 500$ account buy ins and feedback system would help defend against this attack. LE would need to spend a large portion of money to set up these accounts but it would only take a few buys before feedback and forums exploded with cries of scams and non delivery. <br /><br /><br />It is imo that Silkroad itself is no longer the target... SR is not alone in this game. LE knows this. Closing one market just shifts the user base to another and brings more markets to light. LE will likely focus on something they all share in common, and this is cryptocurrency and shipping. I would expect legislation that would attempt to destabilize the currency and make it&#039;s use difficult, although in the long run I could not see it being successful. I expect legislation protecting mail from search and seizure to be overturned or severely diminished. Time will tell. In this case the jack is out of the box and the idea has bloomed. SR was a pioneer in this expiriement and it has proven succesful. Others will follow. &quot;Drugs in the mail&quot; for the masses is here to stay for the foreseeable future.

				LE has unlimited funds on the drug war.&nbsp; Recently there was an incident where LE set up a vendor account, shipping domestic, waited for the escrow release and then made the bust.&nbsp; Brings to me the question whether it is better to order international rather than make it easy to make it easy for LE to bust within their jurisdiction.&nbsp; Then again, the drug war is global and all they have to do is pass off the info to the area needed, which is what i believe they call a &quot;joint effort&quot;.&nbsp; The trick i&#039;ve seen is just get the mail man used to the fact that you receive a shit load of packages a day from all around the world.&nbsp;

Although it depends on whether LE are actually serious about reducing drug markets online or just want a symbolic victory. If they only care for the symbolic (looks good politically, but has no actual effect on the market overall), bringing down an individual marketplace like SR would be a priority. As we know, this would disrupt things only briefly while people moved to another marketplace. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think option 2 (LE posing as vendors) would work. People have their own vendors they trust, and it doesn&#039;t take long for untrustworthy vendors to be identified. LE would have to send real drugs in the post to build up a reputation, then after building a large customer base, start their arrests... Can&#039;t see LE sending real drugs in the post to people. That would be pretty controversial with the public once it became known!

				I believe on the last SR exposure broadcast style, there was some computer cat&#039;s from various institutions claiming it would take way too long to attack this situation virtually.&nbsp; Then it moved onto an interview with a global feddy type stating that they&#039;re just sharpening the mail seizure tech because that&#039;s all they really can go on for now.&nbsp; Of course as mentioned before, allocation of funds and political motivation will be what really fuels their tactics on the new war on drugz v.4.7 premium edition ;p<br />&nbsp;:o 8) ::) :P
