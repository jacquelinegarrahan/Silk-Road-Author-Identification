				I think the topic was already discussed long time ago.<br />Anyway I want to say again: If SR wants to live for a long time<br />kick off weapons and everything can be used to harm other people !!<br />Why we need such things here ? it is a small percentage and most of the people <br />are just disturbed or afraid or simply don&#039;t want to raise unwanted attention to SR ...

				It is not unthinkable that even drugs could be used to harm others. What&#039;s to stop me from buying heroin and injecting a lethal amount into someone I&#039;ve kidnapped (disclaimer: all of this is purely hypothetical, I have no will to hurt anyone and am just showing examples)? How about buying benzos and using them to date rape someone? How about buying mushrooms, grinding them up, and sneaking them into someone&#039;s food before they have to drive a long distance or maybe even a pilot. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think we should splitting hairs here, I am not against weapons themselves or even vending weapons. I think the way SR is right now is pretty close to perfect.

				This IS splitting hairs !&nbsp; ;)<br />the right answer here is that even water can kill if you use in big amounts but<br />the weapons are made to kill !<br />Anyway if something else is made to harm someone should be banned too.<br />Why not to separate oranges and apples if apples are poisoned ?&nbsp; :)<br />why to associate drugs and death ? <br />that&#039;s bad for (most of) us...<br />Lov &#039;n Peace

				I think everyone should have access to guns/weapons<br />weapons don&#039;t kill people,<br />homeland security agents kill people<br /><br />so why bring more homeland security here?<br />I have read a lot of stuff on FBI and DEA capabilities here and on a few other boards, and people all seem to agree that those initials don&#039;t really have capability coming out of their ears.<br />However, the NSA is a different story. They have capability coming out of every orifice!<br />the lawmakers who want to bring down the Road will have a hard time doing it...unless...they can call us terrorists. then we get to see what the NSA capabilities are.<br />so...everyone should have a gun. I have a few. If you can&#039;t just go to a gun shop where you live, buy one through a TOR site. Just NOT HERE.

				If someone wants a gun they are going to get it, period.<br /><br />Would you rather someone get it in a safe manner, on the silk road, where they have a minimal chance of being robbed or assaulted.<br /><br />Or would you rather them go get it off the streets from a random stranger who could easily rob/assault/kill/maim/rape, etc them?<br /><br />Removing guns from the SR is just going to ADD to the violence. <br /><br />It&#039;s common sense. If someone wants something, they&#039;re going to get it, regardless.<br /><br />The SR is not contributing to violence. The SR is a community where people can get what they need/want to get in a safe manner, versus being forced to get it from a potentially dangerous/deadly situation. In my eyes, if you&#039;re for removing guns and other weapons off the SR, you&#039;re also in favor of putting people in dangerous situations to get what they want. Just because it isn&#039;t on the silk road isn&#039;t going to change their desire of wanting it or not.

				It&#039;s kind of a non argument, because no one is going to take the risk buying any serious firearms through the site. I wouldn&#039;t anyway. As far as brass knuckles and stun guns though, I don&#039;t see the harm in having them on the site.

				My fear is that big news story if someone kills someone else with a gun they couldn&#039;t legally purchase, but bought if off of SR. Drugs are one thing, perhaps tolerable by politicians and society in general. Murder is another matter. Yes, you can kill someone with drugs, but guns are MADE for it.<br /><br />Do what everyone else does if they need a gun - post an ad on Craigslist without using the word &quot;gun&quot;. Beretta products, things that go boom, that sort of wording.

It&#039;s not like SR is some media site trying to gain the trust of the everyday average joe. It is what it is, and people will use it for what they need regardless of how the media views it.

				to me it doesn&#039;t matter about people being killed by this or being hard to get IRL, the point is that the DEA can&#039;t shut this place down, but the NSA could. the NSA doesn&#039;t go after drugs, they go after guns, period! there are sites that sell guns. I support that! buy guns! it is not only (in the US) a right to bear arms, it is a responsibility! More guns= less violence, period! but there are places to buy guns that do not jeopardize the store by poking the NSA with a stick and daring them to take action. if those same politicians brought up Silk road as a terrorist organization rather than a drug store, who knows where we would be by now, but it probably wouldn&#039;t be here debating whether or not we want the site taken down by those who actually could.<br />Brass nuckles, knives, anything that you can buy at any truckstop across the US isn&#039;t going to get their attention, but they still shouldn&#039;t be here because they open the door to having bigger things for sale on the road.<br />

Either the NSA can&#039;t shut down SR, because they would have by now if they could<br /><br />2. They are already using a backdoor that the Naval Research guys put in Tor and are using it to keep track of all us. In which case I don&#039;t think they would go after the site or users directly, since that would give away that you weren&#039;t anonymous. But they would use it to find out who we are and go after us in other ways so as not to reveal they have a backdoor thru Tor.

				If it makes any of you feel any better, I actually used to work for the NSA.<br /><br />The organization consists largely of men age 20-28, seated several meters below Fort Meade, Maryland, in front of massive computers capable of listening in on every single cellphone conversation in the world.<br /><br />And what we&#039;d do is spin through the dials until we&#039;d find someone having phone sex, and we&#039;d yell &quot;GOT ONE!&quot; and everyone else in the room would come over and listen and laugh their asses off.&nbsp; Oh, and the most hilarious phone sex would ALWAYS be in German.<br /><br />Really, as long as America doesn&#039;t give a shit about Silk Road - that is, as long as the media doesn&#039;t cause a shitstorm, leading politicians to believe that they can gain votes by taking down Silk Road - everything will be ok.&nbsp; We must be as plain and nondescript as the plain yellow envelopes that we send through the mail every day.&nbsp; We are the Yellow Envelope Corps.

They do have some pretty substantial resources at their disposal for this sort of thing but it really depends on a case of time and energy and reward and I think at least for now there is enough sense of futility as it wouldn&#039;t be hard to stand up another site and it isn&#039;t a substantial threat in some way they are just going to let other agencies worry about dealing with it.

				With the recent passing of the NDAA in congress, this state is slowly becoming a police state. We need more guns on SR. People need to stock up to protect themselves from the government that is going to be soon strolling the streets like it&#039;s from the book 1984.<br /><br />You may have to zoom in on the picture to read it...<br /><br />http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvo1b7zvi61qlscd2o1_500.jpg<br /><br />&quot;This bill for the first time in American history authorizes the US military to detain, torture, and even assassinate American citizens on US soil -- no right to a trial, no access to a lawyer, the government need only accuse you of being anti-government or connected to terrorism for the NDAA provision to apply to you&quot;<br /><br />Just my opinion, I want more guns on SR, for my own protection

				Not everyone can purchase guns legally, and perhaps some also don&#039;t want to have it documented that they own a gun, this would make them a target for a multiplicity of reasons.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you can pick and choose which contraband you will allow for sale and what you will not, once you start doing that it&#039;s no longer an open or free market.

				Firstly nobody said anything about trafficking in humans, secondly I suspect that wouldn&#039;t be allowed by the site rules anyways.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a matter of &#039;it&#039;s all illegal bad stuff who cares?&#039; it&#039;s a matter of you can&#039;t pick favorites, it&#039;s either an open and free market or it&#039;s not, when you start imposing your ethics or morality on someone else by deciding what they can and cannot obtain then you are undermining the very principle that this site is built upon.<br /><br />So I guess heroin couldn&#039;t be used as a killing tool?<br /><br />Guns are nothing more than a bunch of metal (or composite material) they on their own are inanimate objects. It&#039;s the people operating them that do the harm. Just like it&#039;s the junkie pushing the plunger and overdoses (to their own demise) that kills them. I see no difference, you can kill yourself, or others with a number of substances on here, or cause them great harm if you are malicious enough so whats the justification for determining which are &#039;ok&#039; on what is supposed to be a &#039;free&#039; market.

				these sort of threads will get rehashed as long as there&#039;s silkroad type websites. <br />They&#039;re pretty tired libertarian/ anarchist arguments. Organ and people trafficking, CP and assassination necessarily harms others. Weapons, poison and drugs are different shades of the same grey in that each has the potential to harm others. In the &#039;real world&#039;, the vast majority of people don&#039;t buy an unaccountable firearm unless they need it for a crime. In the &#039;real world&#039;, the vast majority of murders aren&#039;t committed with heroin and the vast majority of recreational drugs are used without direct harm to others.<br /><br />cyanide&#039;s a super useful one carbon building block, you can make drugs with it. coinchipz doesn&#039;t seriously want any, or nicotine. the sale would fall through after a series of bullshit excuses. <br /><br />

				In the &quot;real world&quot; the vast majority of people live under conditions where a very small group has been enabled to both live parasitically from the energies of the masses while simultaneously retarding the engine of wealth creation that would lift even the poorest from poverty should it be allowed to run at it&#039;s optimum speed, whatever that might turn out to be.<br /><br />In the &quot;real world&quot; these criminals are enabled by having the manufactured consent of those they prey on as no minority could victimize the majority without somehow gaining their consent first. In the &quot;real world&quot; this consent is rendered even more sinister by the fact that unlike the consent of an invading force using outright fear to gain a begrudging consent they shove in one&#039;s face the &quot;legitimacy&quot; gained by the fact that they were willingly thrust into this position by the horribly misunderstood process of democracy.<br /><br />In the &quot;real world&quot; people&#039;s best intentions are systematically converted into the very rope that will hang them but not before forcing them underground just to partake in activities that without the &quot;unintended consequences&quot; (are they really unintended?) of prohibition would harm very few but the actual partakers. They need only irritate the wrong person to find themselves wearing the label &quot;terrorist&quot;, to find themselves being beaten by those who &quot;protect and serve&quot;, to find themselves railroaded in a kangaroo court or worse, hauled away in the night without the rights of habeous corpus all in the name of &quot;national security&quot;.<br /><br />In the &quot;real world&quot; people&#039;s own will to control their fellow man, to decide what he should have or really needs to have or not have as his property, is the source of their problems, and the vast majority of them are blind to this fact.<br /><br />In the &quot;real world&quot; this power is invariably turned upon those who created it with ill conceived but good intentions.

The very essence of what Silk Road is aimed to circumvent. Take the time to read up on the origins of the name of the site. If you haven&#039;t already it&#039;s basically a set of trade routes where any and everything was for sale over in the Asian and Middle Eastern areas. It&#039;s often credited as being one of the most significant factors in the growth and development of the civilizations over there due to the fact that it was a free and open market.<br /><br />When you understand that this can only occur in a truly free market (this sort of growth and thriving) then you can understand the value of what SR offers now. Sure for now it&#039;s mostly drugs and contraband, in the future who knows what it might allow for but the possibilities are endless, unless we start putting limitations on them now, like preventing purchases because someone presumes to know the intention of a buyer and that what they are acquiring has potential to cause harm. However this is the very thinking that let to many countries becoming more and more &#039;police states&#039; and what many of us come here to avoid.<br /><br />And MANY people buy undocumented firearms specifically for the purpose of avoiding being a target by LE or it being documented with any agency or law enforcement body. Who&#039;s guns do you think are going to get seized first if they were to implement something like that? Bet your ass it would be the same people who are all on paper with them right now.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather have an undocumented firearm through private sale than any other way.

				This is a difficult question. <br /><br />At the end of the day, I want my high-quality drugs and I don&#039;t want to spend weeks and months going to shows just to network with drug dealers. <br /><br />I have an informed opinion on the matter and I don&#039;t think guns will really change anything on the SR. First, guns on the SR will likely stay within a country since it&#039;s likely hard to ship guns across borders. <br /><br />Second, the American government doesn&#039;t seem particularly well equipped to track arms sales. First, many guns are available for sale at local gun shops. Second, many guns can be sold more readily at local gun shows. <br /><br />I do wonder what the market is for guns on the Silk Road. It seems like responsible people can already buy guns for the most part (at least in the United States). I wonder whether a criminal element will buy guns on the SR, though it seems like most criminals who buy guns to use them already have arms dealers. Combined with the Silk Road&#039;s transaction fees and the fact that bitcoins create much more of a papertrial than cash f2f transactions, I can&#039;t imagine that large scale arms dealers and organized crime rings will come to the SR to do business. Though I could see them meeting on the SR. <br /><br />I say, &quot;why not?&quot; There&#039;s already heroine, meth, and pcp on here and everything hasn&#039;t gone to shit. Are guns really that much worse? I bet there wont be many guns for sale at a time and it&#039;s unlikely that guns bought on the SR will be used in crimes much more than guns bought by other means. <br /><br />My only worry is that we&#039;ll get some nifty guns like fully silenced glocks or something on here and the walmart crowd will come on the SR to check them out and realize that they can scam weed out of sellers. But that isn&#039;t a problem with guns so much as it&#039;s a problem with there not being a good system to review buyers. <br /><br />P.S I know some might find this disagreeable, but could we ban some &quot;guns&quot;? I&#039;m fine with any arms, but I would stop using SR if there were any fragmentation or incineration granades, anti-tank weaponry, any anti-aircraft weaponry, land mines, or mortars. That&#039;s just too much for me.

				..i would tend to agree with most of the points in post above...<br /><br />organised crime / org gangs ...are supposed to be organised and aren&#039;t gonna waste time in front of a screen doing what they think is nerdy....its a completely different league...<br />i somehow think the mix &#039;n mash of things for sale adds some sort of variety....<br />another comment is , there haven&#039;t been much guns for sale anyways....not that i&#039;ve noticed....i mean there aren&#039;t 10 ads are there -so really don&#039;t quite get what the fuss has been about with these threads...etc.. {or have i missed something....}<br /><br />its my guess, individuals think that it attracts too much attention and with the SR being reported here and there -and when its seen that a gun can be bought it would draw attention to SR and hence be closed down quicker.<br />so if i had to choose between drugs and guns, well obviously the clear winner is drugs.<br />if its means moving guns off into a sister site to diminish the attention, then as long as i have access to that site then perhaps thats acceptable.<br />

				I support gun ownership and I do think they should be allowed here but I also agree that guns will lead 2 intense police attention and more infiltration of LE.<br /><br />The problem lies within the geography of the gun trade. Naturally, the seller must get them from the source country which would most likely be the USA, Russia, and China. Guns within those countries can be sold for twice thier value in war ravaged states. <br /><br />So most orders are going 2 be technically international arms smuggling. That will surely attack a great amount of scrutiny. In addition what if someone uses a weapon from SR in a crime then honestly tells the police officer interrogating him where he got the knife?<br /><br />SR does make very much off weapon sales but they do cause heat with gov agencies all over the world who otherwise wouldn&#039;t be interested.

				I am an international village kind of guy - I have lived in many countries with all kinds of rules and regs.<br /><br />Let me say that I understand completely the Euro frustrations with Americans and their gun obsessions.<br /><br />I also understand completely the American frustrations with euros who don&#039;t understand the need to feel secure and prepared for any eventuality.<br /><br />Let&#039;s just say that in this case, both realities are true. <br /><br />I personally am more or less a pacifist. I do not agree with violence, even though I hold quite radical politics and would like to see all governments overthrown.<br /><br />But the realities on different sides of the pond are quite different. In Europe I would not want to own a firearm, In the US I would.<br /><br />(I have not enough direct experience of&nbsp; other countries to have a reliable opinion - I have spent time in many other countries but recognize my opinions there are relatively subjective. In Australia or SA for example, I think I might saw towards the USA point of view but I am not certain)<br /><br />There are several points to consider.....<br /><br />The USA is one of the most advanced countries in the world on so many levels, but it is also still the wild west in so many other ways. Many states have a feeling of utter lawlessness....many cities too. It is a case of the bad guys having weapons, so I gotta have them too. Plus the added factor of a relatively high level of corruption in government from local politics through federal - it&#039;s enough to make anyone want to safeguard themselves and their families, just in case the worst happens. And there is a constant discussion on all levels from the lowest classes to the highest classes about &quot;what if&quot;....<br /><br />Make no mistake, the USA is still a tinder pot and despite it&#039;s position at or near the top of league tables in so many areas of life, it also represents the worst of things as well. if the shit hits the fan then it will be every man for himself.<br /><br />Europe is so so so much more refined (or if you think that word is too heavily weighted - then lets say it is so so so convoluted), in terms of its politics. despite the fact that most Americans think they were the ones that won the war for Europe, nearly everyone in Europe has a direct connection within one or two generations to the war. We all lost loved ones. Nobody really wants to go down this route, and everyone will bend over backwards to prevent it. <br /><br />If the shit hits the fan in Europe, the battles will take place in debating chambers and polling booths. Nobody has an appetite for the the kind of armed conflict that many disenfranchised Americans would relish.<br /><br />This goes a long way to explaining the different attitudes to this on each side of the pond, but there are so many other subtleties that I would have to write a book to cover everything.<br /><br />Still, I vote for no weapons on SR.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well If you are in the US then perhaps you have justification for arming yourself, but you have no problems getting weapons. There is no need to tarnish a whole community with your transactions. If you live in the US and you can&#039;t get a gun then you are a retard. I am not even American but I know places I can go buy guns in a flea market if i need to - no questions asked. I even know places I can go to buy Uzis and AK47s with very little questions asked, and I live in one of the most anti gun states in the US. I value something like SR very much and I would not like jeopardize it by bringing unwelcome attention or making it a scapegoat.<br /><br />If you are in the EU then why do you need a weapon? If you are a gangster then you already have the contacts. If you are a revolutionary then you need the contacts AND the backing- getting your weapons from silk road is not gonna cut it, and armed over throw of the governments of your country is the absolute last resort and will lead to heavy losses. The reality is you are a probably some kind of fantasist who thinks having a gun is gonna make you some kind of player. well this is not the case. If you are a dickhead now, then all that will happen will be you will become a dickhead with&nbsp; gun. Best case scenario is you get more self esteem, and pull more chicks, worst case scenario is you will end up being another Anders Breivick. Whatever your political beliefs I am sure you can see that this was a major FAIL for all concerned.<br /><br />If you are a revolutionary in the EU and you want to change the system then this is probably the least effective method. If you wanna be a G then believe me, having a gun does not make you a G.<br /><br />Either way, I hope you can see that whatever your political beliefs, trading guns on SR does not benefit anyone, and is more likely to shut down this nice little operation, rather than aid you in your quest.<br /><br />If you want your guns, get your guns somewhere else. And get them in a way that only one or two people know you got them. and you don&#039;t affect everyone else&#039;s trading by doing so.<br /><br />Whether you&#039;re in Europe or the US ( or anywhere else really), give me a shout when you get them and I&#039;ll happily come shooting with you for a day or two. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want no guns, not right now thank you..... Please don&#039;t screw up a great way for me to get some nice pot, or a few trips, please.<br /><br />Ed<br />
