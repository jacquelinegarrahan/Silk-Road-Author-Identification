				You answer your question yourself.. most vendors are located where shipping methods work the best.. if you could send drugs easily by mail from production centers to distribution hubs cartels would be out of biz.. somebody has to pay bribes on customs and enforce big chunks of land. Explanation is that the volume of mail from Peru or Ecuador to USA is like 0.001% of the regular mail that travels inside USA, inside EU, and between those two.

				Developed Western countries have higher drug consumption as well. Also, most Latin American cartels aren&#039;t very technologically apt. People involved with them have better things to do than sell relatively smaller amounts on SR. Internet penetration is certainly increasing in developing countries, but their idea of using the internet is often just going to an internet cafe to use Facebook. Tor is beyond their current level of computer literacy.

				Isn&#039;t it obvious? It&#039;s because the west is the most technologically advanced, has the best resources and products available. How is someone in a war torn country in the East going to have access to Tor, a laptop, and a reliable and secure postal service when many of the people living there don&#039;t even have democracy, clean running water and a proper shelter?

				a lot of developing countries have non existent or really slow internet just for clearweb, it&#039;d take ages to use tor. then computer ownership and internet access from home isn&#039;t anywhere near as common as it is in europe/north america. you got language barriers, corrupt postal systems, no way to cash out bitcoins, mail would get profiled. it&#039;d be shit, look at la fuentes success rate if he&#039;s still vending... china works because they ship crazy amounts of legit packages all over the world so it doesn&#039;t stand out like colombia for example.

				one reason i can think of is that english is not widely understood in south america. a would be vendor would have a hard time learning how to use pgp and what&#039;s the best stealth techniques etc by reading the forums because everything is in english. not to mention customer service lol
