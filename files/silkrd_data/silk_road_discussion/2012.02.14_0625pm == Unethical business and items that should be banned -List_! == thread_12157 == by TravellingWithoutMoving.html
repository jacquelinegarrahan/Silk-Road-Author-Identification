				Things become grey when you consider whether something is &quot;most likely&quot; used for ill purposes. <br />The line for me is pretty black &amp; white, i.e. involuntary victims must be involved in the production or use of the product/service.<br />Note the words involuntary and must.<br /><br />Correct me if i&#039;m wrong, but Cyanide, bomb making materials, and radioactive chemicals have non harmful uses?

				I don&#039;t mean to cause any conflict here but why exactly do you want things banned so much?! <br />An excerpt from something you said yourself in another thread: &quot;...so long as firearms are allowed and discussions on cyanide and where to source it {which 99.9% of SR forum think is fine..}...&quot; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12043.msg114269#msg114269) - if most people seem to take an agorist view on items such as cyanide, why are you looking to get it banned? Simply because you personally disagree with it? (I use cyanide as a representative example in this case.) I understand that you may have moral views on guns etc. which may cause you to disagree with them being listed, but just because you disagree with them doesn&#039;t mean they shouldn&#039;t be available to others who do agree with them. One may argue the point that listing guns may draw added LEO attention to Silk Road, and one may indeed be right, but that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that there will be any increased risk to Silk Road - if they can&#039;t bust us now, what would make one think that they could bust us then?<br /><br />Getting back to the disagreeing with a particular product - I myself have an issue with heroin because of how the abuse of it by a member of my extended family has impacted on those I love, and personally I would never use it. However, I wouldn&#039;t like to see a ban on the sale of heroin because it would go against the agorist ideals of Silk Road, and because it is every person&#039;s personal choice what they do with their own body.<br /><br />Cyanide, for one thing, should definitely be available - if this is an issue about suicide / poisoning, there are plenty of ways to do both without using cyanide. It also has many other uses apart from the historical &#039;holocaust era&#039; use. Silk Road is supposed to be an agorist marketplace, and this is an agorism-centred community, not a restrictive government-led nanny state. SR/DPR stated as much regarding defeating government restriction in his State of the Road address. Why substitute a government-imposed restriction for a restriction imposed by another entity?!<br /><br />Radioactive chemicals and bomb-making should also, in my opinion, be available for anyone interested in them (though sending them through the mail would be incredibly unethical due to the harm they would / could cause to unsuspecting people whilst being moved to their destination.)<br /><br />Again, I just felt I had to speak up on the issue - I fully respect your point of view, although I disagree with it completely. I am, however, curious as to the reasons behind it?<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				- cyanide -i don&#039;t , it was an open ended question ....and virtually nobody had any opinions....so it must mean to 99% of SR&#039;s think&nbsp; that cyanide is ok....<br />{sorry for the confusion...cyanide doesnt belong here...i never claim to want to do harm to any vendor nor buyer...thats not supposed to be the reason we are here<br />&nbsp; for...}<br /><br />- guns, lets just say it has its place...ultimately is not my decision to allow their sale, hence one can express an opinion but one of&nbsp; my last posts beg the question &quot;..what does DPR think..&quot;, why would i say this....because sometimes you have to take into account everyones opinions and i see merit in both sides so to speak...or<br />&nbsp; when you have to cater for everyone there has to be a compromise since its a double-edged sword...<br /><br /><br />

				The fact of the matter is that this issue is entirely up to DPR.&nbsp; We are all &quot;renting&quot; his private property at the moment, and he could decide to ban listing anything at any time.<br /><br />Be thankful he usually asks for the community&#039;s input before he makes decisions, and that we have been able to influence the course of a lot of the features and changes that have been made to this wonderful place.<br /><br />Do I think cyanide SHOULD be listed?&nbsp; Personally, no.&nbsp; If people want to get together in the forums and discuss sourcing it, that&#039;s up to them and I&#039;m sure that&#039;s not a big deal because it&#039;s just people talking.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR&#039;s policy since day one has been that no products whose sole intention is to cause harm against a human being&#039;s inalienable rights, or is the result of/is used for theft purposes, is to be listed.&nbsp; And just some common sense things.&nbsp; No fake currency (Secret Service can stay where they are), no weapons of mass destruction, no stolen credit cards or financial information, no child pornography, etc.&nbsp; I think a product whose sole intent is to cause harm to another individual or to commit suicide with, like cyanide, has no place being listed on SR (have you ever SEEN what someone looks like after cyanide poisoning!).&nbsp; Any drug you COULD O.D. on intentionally does not mean you WILL.&nbsp; the recreational intent is by far the most common.&nbsp; A gun can be used for self-defense or to protect your property, and on a worldwide scale is used far more for this purpose than to commit murder.&nbsp; You can&#039;t take recreational cyanide, and you can&#039;t give someone cyanide for recreation purposes.&nbsp; It&#039;s a kill-pill.&nbsp; Death (horrible death, if you know what it does) in your palm.<br /><br />If you read through the seller&#039;s guide there is already a pretty comprehensive list of items that aren&#039;t supposed to be on here.&nbsp; I encourage any community member who sees a seller deliberately breaching DPR&#039;s right to his property and to dictate what goes on this market, to inform him directly.&nbsp; He is not a fool, and the choices he makes are what he sees as the strongest for both the survival of SR, and his own survival.&nbsp; This is no game we are playing here.&nbsp; This is a long-standing war that has been raging on and off since the first coffee bans in 1500&#039;s Europe.<br /><br />We have breached a centuries-old defense line with what we are doing here.&nbsp; Every peaceful, mutually-beneficial transaction we make that takes all chance of violence out of the equation literally spits right in the face of the violent state and its legions of worshipful blood-money-paid minions who perpetrate its outright lies and legalism.&nbsp; We have taken most of the guns out of the equation, which is amazing.&nbsp; Unparalleled.&nbsp; There is no reason to risk this and attract hordes more state-resources aimed at the worst kind of violence, just because of a few idiot buyers and sellers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anarcho47

				...thanks for prev post...read it when was originally posted, can the banned list / items not be mirrored on the forum when its easy to get to ..what do you think?!<br /><br /><br />cut &amp; paste from the sellers guide over on SR:-<br />&quot;Restricted items<br />Do not list anything who&#039;s purpose is to harm or defraud, such as stolen items or info, stolen credit cards, counterfeit currency, personal info, assassinations, and weapons of any kind.<br />Do not list anything related to pedophilia.<br /><br />Practically speaking, there are many powerful adversaries of Silk Road and if we are to survive, we must not take them all on at once. Additionally, if you try to please everyone, you will wind up pleasing no one. So certain things are restricted just so we don&#039;t scare too many off.<br /><br />On a moral level, we take the high road, pun intended ;). Those who seek to control the behavior of their neighbors through force are immoral. Silk Road exists to circumvent that force and provide a safe-haven where civilized people can come together in peace for mutual benefit. To allow listings of items designed to defraud or harm innocent people would be to stoop to the level of the very people we are standing up to.<br /><br />If you are unsure about a listing, just drop us a line and we&#039;ll let you know. &quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Both Grahamgreen and Anarcho47 summed it up perfectly. <br /><br />Let&#039;s stay away from &quot;banning&quot; things as a community. Leave that up to DPR. <br /><br />We don&#039;t EVER want to get into a situation when a majority&#039;s sensibility can disenfranchise a minority. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like, don&#039;t buy it. And if enough people don&#039;t like it, it simply won&#039;t be sold. <br /><br />Otherwise, if we try to rule by committee, you may find your drug of choice on the ban block.

				I&#039;m sure Ianfleming was being somewhat tongue-in-cheek but his post combined with BenJesuit&#039;s immediately afterward point to an important contrast I think needs to be addressed: <br />-Don&#039;t sell people<br />-If you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy it<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s at all justifiable to have human trafficking involved in this website and I doubt that anybody here would argue with me. So that implies that the Line is drawn somewhere, right?<br /><br />Well even if we say that Line is &quot;don&#039;t hurt anybody&quot; it begins to get fuzzy right away: obviously weapons hurt people (save the &quot;arm the world like we were Swedish so there&#039;s no more crime&quot; argument, please). Obviously drugs hurt people (save the &quot;every drug is great and we should put acid in the water supply&quot; argument, please). Obviously that GORGEOUS guitar up for sale on the road now hurts people (save the &quot;Ozzy didn&#039;t make that kid commit suicide&quot; argument, please). Obviously . . . . . .&nbsp; <br /><br />With that point made, I&#039;ll stop joke-exampling :) <br /><br />The logical train of questions that follows the above logic : <br />1- If this isn&#039;t a democratic issue, can we still democratically decide how to decide it, if not democratically? <br />2- In that case, wouldn&#039;t the only solution be to essentially elect someone to decide for us?<br />3- To prevent this from becoming a weird dictatorship or something wouldn&#039;t it be better if we elected a GROUP of someones to decide for us? <br />4- How do they decide, if not democratically?<br />5- Is that not the impetus for the problems that drove us SR Weirdos underground to begin with?<br />6- Rallying against that happening, is the only other choice sheer anarchy?<br />7- If we embrace Anything Goes anarchy - I mean *really* anything goes, not just &quot;it&#039;s absurd we can&#039;t take certain chemicals&quot; - how long would it be before human traffickers and stuff take over the Road and it becomes its own worst nightmare? <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but I simply cannot agree with the thinking that seems to imply that there are no real criminals out there doing real terrible things to real human beings. Or that we should do anything to foster that.<br /><br />Just your Local Friendly Neighborhood Shredmod trying to keep this discussion going.

				I think chemicals of any sorts should be able to be sold here in the interest of those with the love of chemistry.&nbsp; Cyanide is used in a lot of organic chemistry reactions, and I&#039;m sure there are some home chemist here who might have reason to buy certain chemicals through illicit alleys.&nbsp; And if someone buys it for other reasons, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll find a way anyway but I don&#039;t think a lot of them would think to come here first...

				SR cannot readily facilitate the logistics of trafficking in humans. So that argument is moot. <br /><br />What&#039;s left?<br /><br />Child pornography. Those crafty degenerates might list their horrible filth in such a way that you wouldn&#039;t even know it was child porn. But in their little private club(s) on TOR will say, &quot;look for the listing by **** titled Rudolf the red nose rein deer HD. It&#039;s going for about 10 BTC. Be sure to use the code word KIDZRUS in the order box otherwise your order will be cancelled.&quot; And none of us would be the wiser.&nbsp; There&#039;s lots of ways these monsters can conceal their trade on SR. <br /><br />Though, it doesn&#039;t hurt to have a rule against selling CP on SR even though they can easily get around it. <br /><br />What else is left then?<br /><br />Ah right, stuff sold in the Armory. Same thing as the child porngraphers, they can conceal their listings and require code words in the order box to validate. <br /><br />So putting up all sorts of prohibitions is just to soothe our collective conscious. But without a way to investigate and enforce what is prohibited from being sold, the prohibitions amount to nothing more than a polite request. <br /><br />I mean, sure, we can draw a line, but it has to be VERY specific and not based on personal sensibilities. You know, there are some people who wish Meth, GHB and heroin weren&#039;t sold on SR but are perfectly fine with most strains of Sativa(weed) and shrooms as these things are all natural. This why I&#039;m saying, we need to be careful with giving place to the idea of the prohibition of things. <br /><br />I not saying a line can&#039;t be drawn. I&#039;m just saying, be very careful with the stick you&#039;re using to draw the line. Be mindful of hypocritical positions. <br /><br />Lastly, we probably don&#039;t need to worry so much. For the &quot;bad&quot; things that can be sold, there is hardly a market for it on SR due to the difficult risks in moving such items and the fear of a controlled delivery. Those things work best when conducted face to face and seeing before buying. While everything on SR is sold on a trust basis (with escrow helping to maintain trust), it will be hard to trust someone selling Anthrax or Sarin Gas if the seller isn&#039;t known or referred by a trusted someone in that particular underground community.&nbsp;

To buy and sell drugs? Yes that too. But they are not thinking of the full situation. Silk Road has to exist because the &quot;democracy&quot; at work in the world prevents us from openly purchasing our drugs of choice or drugs we always wanted to try. And all because of the sensibilities of a few convinced a majority that these drugs are bad. (OK some are. Especially if abused. I&#039;m not going to kid myself).<br /><br />But that&#039;s the point. Democracy sort of sucks. It invariably disenfranchises a minority. <br /><br />But all that aside for a sec, the main reason why some want to impose a whole host of limits on SR is because they are afraid of losing SR and think some things being sold will hasten SR&#039;s demise. <br /><br />Now that I get. And let&#039;s face it - we all share that fear to one degree or another. <br /><br />But I place my faith in Dread Pirate Roberts. He has the highest LEO price on his head more so than any of us - vendors included. He will obviously do all he can to ensure SR&#039;s survival as well as his own survival. So if DPR makes yet another market to traffic in unmentionables, he&#039;s doing so not only based on his agorist principles, but also after assessing the risks to himself and SR. <br /><br />BTW; stock up on drugs. &#039;Cause you never know. *big grin*

				Human trafficing requires face to face meetings within a trusted sub community. Anonymity doesn&#039;t work in that sphere of crime. Rep and vetted referrals are a must. <br /><br />Imagine an SR listing. &quot;Pretty, tanned, dark haired, A cup boobed, Thai ladyboy will do everything up to and including bareback. And she/he cooks. Mostly Ramen though. But learns fast if S&amp;M applied liberally. Has all shots and no STDs&quot; Asking 10,000 BTC. Willing to stay in escrow until delivered and sampled for fit.

But what I found to be the crux of that debate is that people were simply afraid of losing SR. They had the fear that more &quot;heat&quot; would be brought down on SR if guns were sold. It was an unsubstantiated argument based on fear alone since there is no precedent to draw on. And of course, there were also those who tried to inject their sensibility against guns into the discussion. <br /><br />At the end of the day, what was exposed by all that discussion about guns on SR is an acute lack of faith many have in Dread Pirate Roberts to protect SR from LEO attack. As if LEO hasn&#039;t been trying all along and DPR was just lucky Silk Road is still up.

				I was quite scared at first that this place wouldn&#039;t last long, I&#039;m still a n00b and I don&#039;t know very much about technical issues but I think I&#039;ve been convinced that DPR knows what he&#039;s doing and that we can survive almost any attack by LE.<br /><br />I am not really for banning anything from SR and I don&#039;t think we have the right to make that decision, but I did think that the comments on another post concerning this re the legality of SR do have some relevance.&nbsp; If SR sticks to drugs then we are all a bit safer, if things like hitmen and child porn are openly sold here then it increases the potential resources that LE could muster against SR, stronger laws and more resources could be applied and our relative safety will be diminished... <br /><br />Limiting what can be sold here will limit potential LE actions against SR.<br /><br />That said I doubt it would do much good anyway, since we will get stained with what ever is on Tor by the press anyway, even if we stick rigidly to drugs we will still be accused of facilitating human trafficking, cp and hitmen. <br /><br />Rationality has never been a strong point of anti-drug campaigners.

				I&#039;d say whatever the people running the site prefer, since it&#039;s their baby. As for ethics, even hiring a hit man could be justified under some circumstances. I personally feel that anything extremely dangerous or objectionable like poison chems or &quot;terror tools&quot; or illegal exploitation of human beings esp. children would draw unwanted attention from the pigs, so for that reason restricting such things is probably wise. It looks like, for whatever reason, I don&#039;t see anything like that offered.

				hold on...<br /><br />who are you to stop me selling my soul if i want to? cencorship is a dangerous road to go down. My understanding of SR&#039;s stance on this subject is the harm principle. If it doesnt directly harm other people, its fine by them.<br /><br />that rules out child porn, CC details and arguably weapons (though thats controversial)<br /><br />if i want to sell my soul, i can sell it. If i want to sell my spleen and someone will buy in anonymously, you have no right to stop me. <br /><br />thats what brought us all to here, dont try and enforce your views on us all and ruin it. <br /><br />
