				Not gonna say &quot;noob&quot; - OK, fine. <br /><br />Is the feedback rating in parenthesis next to the vendor&#039;s name (a la ebay)? If so, how come they are all 98 or 100? <br /><br />Is there a way to view only vendors who have NEVER been accused of scamming? <br /><br />Is there a way to sort by price? It seems like a mish mash sorting affair when looking at the list. <br /><br />Anybody know the penalties from getting caught receiving small quantities of Adderall in the USA without a prescription? I can get weed locally, so I personally am not going to take that risk, but Adderall is not something I can procure myself. <br /><br />Am I going to have a hard time getting a fair price being that I&#039;m completely new without a history? <br /><br />If you have the time to answer one or more of these questions - thank you. If not, please just move along instead of flaming me. Thanks! <br />

				first, dont conduct business on the forums - only use listings on SR - or else you will likely be scammed <br /><br />there used to be an option to sort by price but it was removed because it never worked correctly <br /><br />read the rumor mill to determine who you can trust... vendors can falsify their own feedback. most of the scores are high because the rating system is whack and everyone expects to get a 5/5 unless the order goes VERY wrong - most vendors prefer the opportunity to make it right first to keep their score at 100<br /><br />however, just because its not 100 doesnt mean much either because there are too many buyers who try to use feedback extortion to attempt to scam vendors and so they should be told to fuck off but they leave bad ratings so read the rumor mill for vendor reviews<br /><br />its a federal offense, but the risk is limited if you do everything safely. spend a couple weeks reading the forum before ordering, especially the security section. small quantities are morel likely just to be confiscated then to have a controlled delivery<br /><br />youre gonna have a hard time getting a fair price for adderall period, just because demand is high and supply is low - it wont matter you are new except some might request you finalize early which is forfeiting your protection against being scammed so look for vendors who allow you to stay in escrow if possible, if not use one with TONS of positive reviews on the forum <br /><br />------<br />BP, nice of you to offer help but please do it respectfully, you calling everyone noobs in an insulting manner comes off at least to me as disrespectful. plus he can just post his DOC openly and get recommendations imo

				Micro - thank you for your most thoughtful reply.<br /><br />I have another question if you, or someone else can donate a few minutes on encrypting my &quot;name and address&quot; PM to the vendor. I downloaded the PGP bundle from a link here, and I&#039;m left with &quot;Kleopatra&quot; on my desktop - I opened it and it&#039;s not really clear. Is there a step-by-step guide to not only encrypt my &quot;name and address&quot; - but what also what is the purpose of the vendors encrypted &quot;--BEGIN--......&#039;end&#039;---&quot; at the bottom of the vendor page, and what am I to do with this information?<br /><br />Thanks in advance. I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m actually spending all these hours even considering ordering a few Adderall over the black market. I must be fucking insane or stupid.&nbsp;

				i wouldnt recommend dealing with BP, he just scammed a member <br /><br />that begin..end thing is called the vendors public key. you need to read more in the security forum like i said - it will answer your questions, if you dont understand what public and private keys are you are far from being able to use a pgp program. <br /><br />id recommend you look into gpg4usb which is an easier program to use -you can get it (and a tutorial) from this site: gpg4usb.cpunk.de<br /><br />just unzip it onto your bootable usb (look into tails or liberte) - no i cant explain it all to you, read the forum <br /><br />then you import the vendors public key (copy the entire public key and paste it in the text box then click import) and then you type your addy, select the key and encrypt using it - can be done in as little as ten minutes once you understand the concept of encryption <br />
