				Are you using Google Chrome or Epiphany on Liberte?<br /><br />It seems that having &quot;AppleWebKit&quot; in the user agent causes the redirect.<br /><br />You should only use Tor Browser over Tor for many reasons:<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/<br /><br />But if you don&#039;t mind compromising your anonymity, simply changing the user agent to look like Tor Browser, or even changing AppleWebKit to &quot;Apple WebKit&quot; should solve the problem. Let me know if it doesn&#039;t.<br />

				I can verify that it was happening to me when I was trying to log into the forums on Friday. The URL kept changing to &quot;learntoplayniceorgoaway.onion&quot;, so I gave up on trying to get onto the forums that day.<br /><br />Not getting that problem today, though, so that&#039;s why I&#039;m here.&nbsp; :P

				It is still happening, I can only log on via firefox. Tor browser will not work, chrome will not work.<br />That is why I have not been on. Using other computers still gives the same problem, something very fishy is going on. I tried 3 different machines, It is my account.

				You mean the URL I am using to log on<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to<br /><br />I am using firefox right now because I cant get on with tor browser.<br /><br />Why am I seeing the redirect lol, I never spammed anything. Some people have been saying that I have leaked my location but I never did any such thing, I think someone has accessed my account.

				Why would it redirect your Tor Browser but not the thousands of other Tor Browsers that people on the forum use? It makes no sense. Did you change the user agent or something?<br /><br />Anyway, when I use the Chrome 28 user agent, I can access the forum just fine.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				This shouldn&#039;t have to be said, but it&#039;s best to avoid using the .to proxy when browsing anything on Tor.&nbsp; Use Tor Browser Bundle, or something like Liberte or Tails.&nbsp; That .to proxy is risky because whoever runs the proxy can see your IP address whereas using Tor helps to keep you anonymous and hidden.
