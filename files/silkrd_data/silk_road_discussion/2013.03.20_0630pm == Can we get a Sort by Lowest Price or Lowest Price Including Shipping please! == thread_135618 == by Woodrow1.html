				We have current sort by: newest, seller rank, and best selling.<br /><br /><br />It would make it a lot easier to find what we are looking for...&nbsp; Also make prices more competitive.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				Pretty sure that will never happen, and for good reason. It will likely cause a mess of people listing stuff for super cheap, and have the real cost in the shipping. Kind of like the crap you see on amazon or ebay. Prices will be competitive based on the market, not the ability to sort by price. That&#039;s the short of it without getting too far into it. Take your time, do your research and you will find the right vendor with the right price for you!

				I want a quantity filter for Cannabis -- Little drop box when a Vendor lists product of whether it is Gram, 3.5, Quarter, Half, OZ, QP, HP, LB+ <br /><br />So I don&#039;t have to scroll thru all them piddly gram shits when I&#039;m looking and trying to compare QPs<br /><br />Edit: Or a search box for buyers that is like the Domestic but it says &quot;What can I afford&quot; which would filter anything that is under your current account balance amount.

Why the fuck not?&nbsp; The sort option for lowest price used to be on here over a year ago im pretty sure... Prices seem higher now also it seems<br /><br />As for the people showing low prices but high shipping...&nbsp; Ebay has a lowest price which includes shipping so im not sure what youre talking about.&nbsp; &nbsp; They could add shipping just like ebay does.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway its a shit load easier to sort through items with more sort options.&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking through it now is like looking through a cluster fuck.&nbsp; I dont even want to try looking at the weed section lmao...

				They are probably not adding the feature because a lot of the Vendors who pay them 500 bucks per account DON&#039;T WANT THIS FEATURE!&nbsp; I am not a vendor and I WOULD LIKE THIS FEATURE but I can easily see how vendors would NOT want this feature to be added.&nbsp; Any vendor who thinks that their product is superior to others and is charging a premium for it will suffer because of this feature because his product will be buried at the bottom of the listings.

				At least a &quot;select quantity&quot; option should be considered.&nbsp; Trying to scroll through 20+ pages for weed is a bit much if you ask me.&nbsp; And yeah, I sort them by newest and scroll all the way to the end before I buy.&nbsp; Found some good deals that way.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think of a single reason why this shouldn&#039;t happen&nbsp; Protecting dealers or whoever from the &quot;free market&quot; is crony capitalism.

				Yes this would help.&nbsp; It would also help to have vendors input units (like grams, ounces, etc) so we could sort price per unit.&nbsp; It would not be easy to implement though because people use different units for different drugs (for instance think about LSD or non-drug products on here).<br /><br />Still it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to add IMHO.

				This should also speed up the system.&nbsp; If you can find what you want within one or two pages your not spending more time on the site hunting for what you want.&nbsp; Anything to help speed up the site is welsome.&nbsp; It&#039;s slow as dog shit lately.

				How about a feature that let&#039;s you narrow it down to the vendors rating % such as &quot;show me the cheapest prices of vendors between ---% and ----% rating.&quot;<br /><br />Would be super easy to find cheap stuff that&#039;s quality this way!
