That is when the forum manipulation will begin, and little noticed censoring may occur. Or perhaps that moderator will go through the motions for a couple of weeks or months and build up a rapport with another member - who just so happens to be one of their colleagues - which will lead to them being recommended for a moderator position themselves, a decision which will most likely be supported by the community at large because &quot;well, they&#039;re just such a great person, right?&quot;<br />This is the deepweb. We are all anonymous here. To be frank, NONE of us have ANY idea who anyone else is, nor do we have any idea who may have been tasked with forum manipulation. I could be LE, you could be LE, absolutely any of us could be LE and there is nothing to be gained by burying one&#039;s head in the sand and ignoring this very real, very dangerous fact. I&#039;m not a paranoid person, and I have no real reason to be. I never see the bulk orders I place on here; I have no contact with the people receiving them, apart from an anonymous payment system. The only personal drugs I use are alcohol, caffeine, an occasional cycle of ephedrine when I&#039;m working out and the occasional viagra when I want to have a better night than usual. None of these will get me in trouble with the law in my country - the latter two might possibly get me a fine, yes, but no record or any other such madness. As such, my &#039;paranoia&#039; is aimed entirely at attempting to ensure the continued freedom of expression that we all enjoy here.<br /><br />We don&#039;t need more moderators; in fact I would argue that we need less. I appreciate the current moderators volunteering their time (and would encourage all users to donate something to them, if they can) but we must ensure the security and freedom of this forum, not leave ourselves open to the possibility of censorship and oppression should the wrong person &#039;get the job&#039; so to speak. We all have enough of that in the real world.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				More mods is the last thing we need around here. In fact I would go as far as saying the people who keep suggesting it are LEO trying to get their partners in. More mods will do absolutely nothing. This is a anonymous board you can just make a new account. We have mods here now, Guru is doing a great job. Ignore the fucking spam it&#039;s that simple.

				as long as you are talking about smf mods that cut down on spam/censor specific words and not Mods as in users who can manually delete posts, then I definitely agree. The last thing we need are more people who will delete threads that THEY believe to be irrelevant, or posts that they just don&#039;t like. Or systematically post hundreds of posts a day across all threads all the while, removing posts that they find offensive.<br /><br />I 100% support any smf add-ons or mods that reduce spam!
