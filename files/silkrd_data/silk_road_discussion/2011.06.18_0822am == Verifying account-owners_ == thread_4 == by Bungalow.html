				Hello Silk Road Admins and Welcome Back!<br /><br />I do have a small question, however. What prevents a scammer/LE to just make a new user with some already-established SR name over here and start posting. I think there should be some form of verification that account X on silk road is the same person as account X on SR Forums.<br /><br />Just my two cents.

				totally agreed!<br /><br />I&#039;d think of a quick solution like:<br />make this board invite only. generate invitation codes with the SR userbase and send messages on the site with the invitation codes. otherwise it&#039;s going to be a chaos soon ...<br /><br />your work and engagement is greatly appreciated guys!

				I believe that is the point of PGP keys =) There is really no reason why people should not use them, every bit of security helps.<br /><br />Some sort of code generated from SR to verify a forum account sounds like a good Idea though.

				Someone stole my name on BlackMarket to scam people.<br />So while SR is down I had my account on OVDB i was trying to sell on.<br />Well, People started saying that maybe i wasnt the real &quot;listentothemusic&quot; on OVDB,<br />and that maybe i got upset about my name getting stolen and made a big deal so i could scam a few more people on OVDB.... <br /><br />Needless to say, verifying owners accounts is hard. Unless you go through a screening process like on OVDB. I just put in my SR profile which is where I have my feedback a list of all my current legitimate accounts. It also helps my buyers be in contact if SR is down.

				Well, I think this thread could solve this problem since the goals of PGP are confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and authenticity.&nbsp; If any one seems sketchy on here and out of character we can write it here and have another known legit vendor can verify them via encrypted msg over the PM, then post results here. May be slightly tedious but it will help ::)

				Everyone, be careful with what you sign. Some could just copy and paste your signed statements to another forum, and they would look legit. PGP signatures include a timestamp, but sometimes people don&#039;t check it, so in a case like this it&#039;s better to leave a plain-text timestamp in the message, and _always_ some context. For example:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />The account with username &quot;paine&quot; at the Silk Road forums (profile: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=275 ) is controlled by the person who controls the account with username &quot;paine&quot; at the Silk Road market (profile and public key: http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/8514 ).<br />Date: 2011-06-19 07:16:01+00:00<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJN/aJHAAoJENTQiXA4HwQiNmoQAK1CloiKzdYmKJzrV5TLvyuj<br />DTrOoVCvK8sJVva9uglahYrpTHFSvYcT5mGe0wICfTnqGVyVewasFs0msZ+Xstg4<br />LsxaMCN0PWdtP/f9eWgDGCDWhjjlCIJez7u8BYZH+24A1jhMQDV7kcaIbtsANVuJ<br />WVlFX2Wj0EeW5wUPhYxB3IhL1rvuhSsrtn38ceGQy9mMNqAUrGBVmVBtsx7qSuCE<br />HWExqYTfJck8yiYrhW8cQRTlw9DkaEKQMN9fmW/Sy8bzsxtwJ+B8ux1VTp5nJVWz<br />QXTye6wibQY8bx6k2ot6E3IcDuPUVn1dOn0o5+HS0uts3md+DjlamqWIV0GB1fRY<br />tsBiDE1tATFM78zmUzXoFjk6fXpcW98/Tw7a45P6Ri7fsvoAER+xpDuOcqSgcnAG<br />Mv08WJKp/cAkBEtao7otFOc3xKtCIy1moOH9APfgnYVOH7b3nZrmli4hKIONuDMv<br />6odul7l5CnlP/n8wDNqj5FePjyeUCENbmtAx8pnhiG1BHBGBfSqRILJRDO0CLeMr<br />aQRjNAdTxfCKg3sRfEzjaJ0c21KUDuIpRnN+aSJzV1HBaRZA+8M0bpbkdIFnbPgr<br />2N4drVfshsY8FOOwn6QcPpd5Lzw+VaEaplx80sMfBfo/gBi7J5knlt/J78kVmdLs<br />NlJxfYs4BjRBQj9SxWfO<br />=zMzU<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />It&#039;s more work, but it helps protect your reputation.<br /><br />(or maybe I&#039;m just paranoid ::))
