				was working 45 minutes ago. but now its down.<br /><br />i wonder whats going on. <br /><br />on a side note (im aware im preaching to the converted here in this great community, and many here could articulate my thoughts in a much better way but i just wanted to say, that<br /><br />&nbsp;i feel it was positive universal karma in a MASSIVE way that this whole &#039;dealing 2.0&#039; emerged in the past few years.<br /><br />&nbsp;I find it remarkable and quite significant that this online global networkhas sprung up ,to enable&nbsp; trading in mind altering substances, plants, herbs and medicines of all kinds in a open and more informative environment. These substances should never have been demonized in the first place. and as a result many poor souls who need medical/mental health to improve their lives are now spending the rest of their lives in federal prisons !! . we must be in a modern dark-age? im inspired to walk down to my local shops with a fur skin vest and a viking shield for some reason haha!<br /><br />&nbsp;the universe/higher self/god / whatever the mysterious power that lies behind this all, it has prompted much needed debate around the world in how we should be handling individuals freedom to ingest all the seed bearing plants and herbs to use and synthesise how we wish to. (i dont mean give heroin and acid to 6 year olds, i mean informed, improved management via government and community ) in 100 years it wont even be an issue. i hope.<br /><br />im not sure how many of you have noticed lately, but there has been a huge push in advertising for &#039;multi vitamins&#039;. its excessive. i grew up around hippies so even tho i love science/chemistry etc, i was always averse to all those multi vits etc. well a few months ago my family GP who is clearly western medical practitioner shocked me by warning me DO NOT TAKE ALL THOSE DAMN Multi-vitamins you see on tv. (i know there maybe exemptions in serious medical recovery etc)but what he said confirmed what i felt all along. generations from many countries have lived to very old age by simply eating the right food and getting lots of sun . and now what pisses me off is these new mini bright coloured candy looking packages of multi-vits for children!!!! WTF, i never saw that shit when i was growing up! that is such bull shit. legalized government sanctioned medicine suppliers feel more insidious than the dirtiest junky dealer hangin out on a street corner. those global pharma companies get away with the worst shit hidden right in public view. Oh yeh i just remembered now they have Ibuprofen for kids/infants.&nbsp; fucks sake, i never saw this shit growing up.<br /><br />surely there are naturopaths and other health professionals who could suggest alternatives to giving your babies that ?<br /><br /><br />ahh sorry for ranting folks. ive been depressed with work and had no one to talk to about this shit thats been irking me!!.<br /><br />I am a bad bad writer. my grammar is shocking so i do apologise!<br /><br />ill shut up know.<br /><br />hope SR gets back up soon!<br /><br />Generally speaking, there seems to be a definite &#039;changing of the guard&#039;

				dont knwo if its tru.....<br /><br />If you were using Startpage on the clearnet (i.e. not through Tor) or you accessed onion.to through a browser other than TorBrowser (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, IE, etc.), then yes, Startpage and onion.to will know your real IP address.<br /><br />However, if you&#039;re using the Tor Browser Bundle (Vidalia) and searched using Startpage in the upper right hand corner, then no, Startpage doesn&#039;t know your real IP address. Similarly, if you access onion.to with TorBrowser then they won&#039;t know your real IP address either. It just means you&#039;re being routed through two different Tor nodes, the one your TorBrowser is currently using and the one the onion.to site runs you through.<br /><br />Sorry if that&#039;s a bit unclear, I&#039;m severely sleep deprived at the minute!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />- grahamgreene

Oh, let me rephrase that, you outright reject the use of PGP despite it being recommended by every respected security orientated person here, you call astor a fool which he is not, you probably don&#039;t even follow any other guidelines for that matter regarding security. A king, you are only king of the fools. There is a reason DPR signs important stuff with his PGP code.<br /><br />The whole &quot;No PGP for the king&quot; is total bullshit especially when nearly every vendor uses it and knows it&#039;s purpose. There is also a reason those who use PGP can be seen as those with a generally more secure approach to accessing SR and purchasing drugs. So don&#039;t try lecture me or call my reasoning for that out because for everything you think you have on me, there are many things I can point out on you as you&#039;ll find out in the upcoming vendor audit yourself. As a note, if I wanted to track you down IRL, it wouldn&#039;t take long and you&#039;re not the only vendor at risk here and something I have messaged DPR about to make a bannable offence if the practice continues.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />DPR signs important stuff because you nut jobs always yell &quot;FBI FBI&quot; when he does not. And he actually forgets about 80% of the time.<br /><br />Also, About the ONLY thing pgp is good for is to post a forum message and to prove you are the one with the Key to send it. <br /><br />If pgp gives you security, then you are the fool.<br /><br />My stance on PGP is well known. ITS FUCKING WORTHLESS.<br /><br />But this thread is not about pgp. It is about the nut jobs that claim SR is taken over every single time SR go&#039;s down. <br /><br /><br />Also it is LAUGHABLE that you believe through tracking you could find me....that shows how LITTLE you know about true security. I do not doubt for one minute that you are a genius when it comes to computers....but when it comes to real life drug dealing, you know...the shit I do, you do not know shit. In fact you admit such.<br /><br />And you CLEARLY do not know a fucking thing about USPS tracking. If you think that from tracking, you could see the ZIP CODE from where I ship, it just shows how little you know. <br />

Vendors can provide tracking on every order here if they wish without any security risk.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure in America there are work-arounds for providing tracking without putting themselves at risk, for every problem in the drugs game there are clever solutions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The fact this nerd said he could track me down in real life...just shows what a loser he is. As soon as he was called out on it...he brings up tracking! <br /><br />He knows NOTHING about tracking, nothing about real life security. He knows about computers. PERIOD. And he should stick to that. I have no problems with the things he says in here based on computers. BUT when it comes to real life security he is useless.<br /><br />

Do you think if you send a package to the white house, the DEA etc that you&#039;ll be safe? They can trace almost all mail no problem, they traced that ricin despite being made in a clean room with no DNA and no other evidence on the envelope, they just traced it back from 1 letter.

I only commented about tracking because YOU said that you could hunt me down. <br /><br />I am sure I have mailed packages to the DEA. As long as the finalize fast and do not ask stupid questions,I am fine with it.

Though I have about 200 times in the last 16 months.<br /><br />Using pgp to send a message is secure in the sense you said. Meaning you are 100% correct that only someone with your key can READ the message. And everyone would assume only you know your key and you do not have it written down anywhere. I don&#039;t disagree with that at all.<br /><br />BUT I am ONLY talking about using pgp for Addresses. The fact is that I HAVE to read it and write it down, and that is where the security risk is. Once I open it, then it is just like anything else without PGP.<br /><br />And ALL of the people that preach pgp are doing so based on the fact that one day SR will get compromised and if you do not use pgp for your address, then your address will be on the servers.( I do not believe that) BUT....THAT IS IT! And I agree that if you use pgp for your address when placing an order that yes indeed your address will never be on SR in anyway. <br /><br />I for one do not think SR will get compromised. And if I am wrong, and it is, then I do not think an address means anything. In fact I KNOW it does not. Not one person would ever get prosecuted or have anything happen to them based on an address found somewhere on the darknet.<br /><br />The fact is,&nbsp; the security threat for the buyer will not be protected in ANY WAY with PGP. It gives a total false sense of security. And actually adds nothing.<br /><br />I will give you an actual case where it is useless. Unlike the so called Guru&#039;s on here that always say what if...I will tell you what happened.<br /><br />So these idiots always say to only use a vendor with pgp. O.k, fair enough, so you believe their total bullshit and you do that and you believe you are totally safe. Now what happens when that vendor that uses PGP decides to write every address down and save them? How did your pgp help you there? It did not!!! It did nothing for you. And that lies the problem with pgp.<br /><br />The fact is that pgp gives buyers a false sense of security and offers no true security. If you want REAL security as a buyer, then you should only deal with a vendor that would never do something so stupid(as to keep anything at all ever) a vendor that has proven over a long period of time that they should be trusted, and a vendor that knows what the fuck he is doing. <br /><br />A PROFESSIONAL.<br /><br />But there are ALWAYS going to be security risk, and the fact is we have to send drugs through some sort of mail, and that is hands down the biggest security threat. As a package with drugs in it with your name on it...it a lot bigger threat then an address on a some server from 5 months ago.<br /><br />The real and only risk for a buyer is when you get the package. It is all about the package. If a vendor gets pulled over going to the post office and they find all his packages, does PGP help you? If&nbsp; a vendor writes everything down and has a drug house....does pgp help you? If the vendor you use, is a druggie himself and been in trouble before, would you want him with your address??? Does pgp protect you from them?<br /><br />I could go it to a lot more detail but this is not the place, and any one with a brain would understand what I mean when I say that PGP is WORHTLESS. All that matters is the person that is opening the pgp. Worry about that guy.

THAT IS IT! <br /><br />I for one do not think SR will get compromised. And if I am wrong, and it is then I do not think an address means anything. In fact I KNOW it does not. That not one person would ever get prosecuted or have anything happen to them based on an address.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That depends on the size of the order, or the order history. LE will probably be interested in people who have purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of drugs. And in any case, LE doesn&#039;t throw away intel. Buyer addresses will definitely get filed away and can be used later to build cases.<br /><br />This is where your opinion differs from most people here, who don&#039;t want to take that risk.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So these idiots always say to only use a vendor with pgp. O.k, fair enough, so you believe there total bullshit and you do that and you believe you are totally safe. Now what happens when that vendor that uses PGP decides to write every address down and save them? How did your pgp help you there? It did not!!! It did nothing for you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We &quot;security gurus&quot; have repeatedly pointed out it doesn&#039;t protect you from that, just as PGP doesn&#039;t protect you from every threat you are potentially exposed to on the darknets, like if LE takes over a server and sends an exploit to your browser.<br /><br /><br />On a related note, regarding this downtime, you say it&#039;s nothing and the server has gone down many times before. That&#039;s true, but the FH server also went down for maintenance many times in its five year history. It only mattered the last time it went down, and a lot of people got pwned (we&#039;ll see what comes of that), but you&#039;ll never know which time that is, so it&#039;s important to be cautious each time something happens.<br /><br />It&#039;s incredibly careless to believe that the SR will never be compromised, as you said, but that&#039;s in line with your general attitude about the technical side of security, it seems.<br />

				RxKing - just because a security measure can be defeated by having poor security in other areas does not make that security measure useless.&nbsp; PGP is hardly worthless, as you claim.&nbsp; Sure, installing GPA and encrypting your address doesn&#039;t create a shield around you that keeps away LE forever lol.&nbsp; But, nothing can do that (and if someone has an LE shield generator - contact me NOW!).&nbsp; Using end-to-end encryption for your communication is still a good idea that certainly can&#039;t hurt.&nbsp; It removes many middle-man worries from the situation, and puts the focus on the vendor.<br /><br />This said, yes, the most important thing is using a trustworthy vendor that has firm security policies in place.&nbsp; We, for example, decrypt and then promptly print addresses and never save anything to disk.&nbsp; The only records we keep are paper copies of tracking w/ recipients initials (no address, nickname, or proper name), and those are kept in a hidden/secure safe and destroyed in a high-security cross-shredder as soon as the transaction is finalized.<br /><br />And seriously - it is nothing short of dangerous to suggest that were SR compromised by LE, addresses would not be used against people.&nbsp; They would 100% be added to a watch list and kept indefinitely.&nbsp; Sure, as a small timer buyer with no criminal record it&#039;s probably not going to matter.&nbsp; But that&#039;s definitely not everyone here I am sure.<br /><br />---<br /><br />On the original topic:&nbsp; SR...

				LOL, all you say is true, but who is talking about pgp protecting you for something encryption has nothing to do with, such as a vendor writing down your information on a piece of paper, or buying drugs online? I was only referring to the security pgp is advertised to provide - assuring you that only the person you send your message to reads it. That&#039;s all it does, no more no less. PGP is an encryption for sending information. And it does that very well, that&#039;s what I was arguing. Who said it was anything more? That&#039;s like saying, since I was using pgp encryption to encrypt a message while I was driving 100MPH down the road in my car, I am safe from a cop catching me and giving me a ticket. Just because we use pgp encryption in the process of a transaction on SR, doesn&#039;t mean that we&#039;re safe from every possible security breach during each step and in every other facet of the transaction besides sending an encrypted message. The only safeguard pgp protects us from is the actual sending and receiving of an encrypted message. Anyone who thinks it is anything more is not too bright.&nbsp; That&#039;s why we talk about stealth packaging, going to many post offices to send multiple packages, and other safeguards. Because we know that other possible breaches of security require other solutions. And everyone on SR knows about most of these, especially stealth packaging. So when we talk about PGP encryption providing security, we&#039;re not talking about security for buying something on SR, we&#039;re talking only about security in sending and receiving a message - that&#039;s it.<br /><br />QM<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=198415.msg1425683#msg1425683">Quote from: RxKing on August 08, 2013, 05:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=198415.msg1425618#msg1425618">Quote from: QualityMeds on August 08, 2013, 05:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">how does PGP not provide security?! Are you MAD?! Of course it does, it is very effective, it&#039;s impossible for anyone who doesn&#039;t have my private key to decrypt a message that was encrypted with my public key.<br /><br />QM<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok I will address this one more time. Though I have about 200 times in the last 16 months.<br /><br />Using pgp to send a message is secure in the sense you said. Meaning you are 100% correct that only someone with your key can READ the message. And everyone would assume only you know your key and you do not have it written down anywhere. I don&#039;t disagree with that at all.<br /><br />BUT I am ONLY talking about using pgp for Addresses. The fact is that I HAVE to read it and write it down, and that is where the security risk is. Once I open it, then it is just like anything else without PGP.<br /><br />And ALL of the people that preach pgp are doing so based on the fact that one day SR will get compromised and if you do not use pgp for your address, then your address will be on the servers.( I do not believe that) BUT....THAT IS IT! And I agree that if you use pgp for your address when placing an order that yes indeed your address will never be on SR in anyway. <br /><br />I for one do not think SR will get compromised. And if I am wrong, and it is, then I do not think an address means anything. In fact I KNOW it does not. Not one person would ever get prosecuted or have anything happen to them based on an address found somewhere on the darknet.<br /><br />The fact is,&nbsp; the security threat for the buyer will not be protected in ANY WAY with PGP. It gives a total false sense of security. And actually adds nothing.<br /><br />I will give you an actual case where it is useless. Unlike the so called Guru&#039;s on here that always say what if...I will tell you what happened.<br /><br />So these idiots always say to only use a vendor with pgp. O.k, fair enough, so you believe their total bullshit and you do that and you believe you are totally safe. Now what happens when that vendor that uses PGP decides to write every address down and save them? How did your pgp help you there? It did not!!! It did nothing for you. And that lies the problem with pgp.<br /><br />The fact is that pgp gives buyers a false sense of security and offers no true security. If you want REAL security as a buyer, then you should only deal with a vendor that would never do something so stupid(as to keep anything at all ever) a vendor that has proven over a long period of time that they should be trusted, and a vendor that knows what the fuck he is doing. <br /><br />A PROFESSIONAL.<br /><br />But there are ALWAYS going to be security risk, and the fact is we have to send drugs through some sort of mail, and that is hands down the biggest security threat. As a package with drugs in it with your name on it...it a lot bigger threat then an address on a some server from 5 months ago.<br /><br />The real and only risk for a buyer is when you get the package. It is all about the package. If a vendor gets pulled over going to the post office and they find all his packages, does PGP help you? If&nbsp; a vendor writes everything down and has a drug house....does pgp help you? If the vendor you use, is a druggie himself and been in trouble before, would you want him with your address??? Does pgp protect you from them?<br /><br />I could go it to a lot more detail but this is not the place, and any one with a brain would understand what I mean when I say that PGP is WORHTLESS. All that matters is the person that is opening the pgp. Worry about that guy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
