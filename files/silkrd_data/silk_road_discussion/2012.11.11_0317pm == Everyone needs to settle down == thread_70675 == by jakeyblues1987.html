				I am a diehard supporter of SR and only if SR stated they were gone and not coming back would I then go to a different source.&nbsp; People need to settle down, listen to what the admins are saying and take their word for it.All websites need work done at various times. The problem is most sites do this at off peak hours but since this is a worldwide site, there are really no offpeak times to shut the website down. Im sure these guys are working around the clock to fix any problems that are occuring. If its up today thats great. If its not up tomorrow Im sure we will have an update as well to the status. These admin know people are freaking out. But I am personally getting tired of people saying they are looking for other sites and if people know of any. SR is the most secure site for doing the things we do. 99% of the other sites are either scams or undercovers. I really do not know if SR went dark for good if Id even go to another site. With that being said lets all just stay calm, remember why we are here in the first place and lastly thank people like Inigo and DPR, who are taking time away from there family and who are more than likely going on no sleep whatsoever, and keep the faith in them. I know I do. Thanks guys for all you do!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~ Jakey B

				AMEN!<br /><br />It is frustrating that the site is down for this long. No one wants it like this....and no one more then DPR. Making crazy post and acting like an idiot helps no one. There has been an update saying things should be back up by Monday.<br /><br />DPR will make an announcement later today(we hope). He is very busy obviously and is trying his best to get the site up. Everyone needs to show respect. If it was not for him then none of us would have this. <br /><br />Everyone have a great Sunday. Go get high, relax,&nbsp; get high again and be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Agreed people need to chill down a bit, but I do see the point in people being panicky, especially on the vendor point of view. Some people here have massive amounts of money either sitting in the escrow system or simply invested in major stashes of drugs. Some of us simply don&#039;t want to deal with the shady drug dealing world and don&#039;t want to be working at the street corners, so SilkRoad offers a safe and secure way of selling any products. <br /><br />There are people that have thousands of dollars invested in drugs here. If SilkRoad goes down, some of us will be broke as hell...so I guess it&#039;s only normal that people get stressed out by a 72 hours offline period. <br /><br />Let us hope it&#039;s back as quickly as possible, I need my SilkRoad fix lol

				I love SR too, HOWEVER, centralization of anything will lead to a terrible situation in the long run.&nbsp; It is the &#039;putting all your eggs into one basket&#039; scenario.&nbsp; For instance, look at how when Mt. Gox got hacked everyone went into panic mode and btc dropped like a rock on all the exchanges.&nbsp; If tradehill had been just as large as Gox then the hit would not have been nearly as bad.&nbsp; And it doesn&#039;t have to even be a hacker or gov entity shutting SR down, like what if the room with their servers caught fire?&nbsp; <br /><br />The point is yes lets not bitch that SR is down because we know they are tirelessly working to get their cash cow back on line, but lets hope some equal competition comes in the near future because we all know that SR growth is exponential and it&#039;s in question that they will be able to keep up.

				DPR could even just set up a second seperate site. Why not?&nbsp; <br /><br />It would also give LE twice the amount of shit to try and deal with too hehe:)

				Am I the only one who remembers in silk road&#039;s early days when SR would be down for extended periods of time?&nbsp; This is nothing new and I wouldn&#039;t be freaking out at this stage.<br /><br />Give it some time folks :)&nbsp; This is a hidden service done by hidden people, this isn&#039;t facebook maintenance.&nbsp; True revolutions tend to have setbacks, but ultimately they succeed.

I think perhaps the operators of SR should look into redesigning the site so that users do not need to maintain bitcoin accounts on the site. When buying something a buyer would transfer bitcoins from a wallet controlled by them to a bitcoin address specifically for that transaction. Then the funds go into escrow and as soon as they are finalized they transfer to an offsite wallet of the sellers choosing. This way if the site is unavailable the only bitcoins tied up would be those in escrow at the moment. It might even be possible to write a doomsday script to finalize all transactions and send the bitcoins to the sellers in the event the site disappears for good.

An &quot;automatic withdraw&quot; option. As funds land in your account from finalisations, it automatically gets sent to a nominated BTC account.
