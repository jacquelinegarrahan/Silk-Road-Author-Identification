				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />First, thanks for all the nice messages about Ben&#039;s situation.&nbsp; I saved them and will show them to him when he comes back.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he will be touched by the kindness of many of the people that he works so hard to please on a daily basis.<br /><br />THE GOOD NEWS: Every order is shipping!&nbsp; All of the Express orders and some of the older First Class orders got shipped on Wednesday.&nbsp; The balance I packed all last night and I&#039;m heading out around noon and putting the balance of them in the mail.&nbsp; So, if your confirmation says it was shipped on Thursday, please don&#039;t start checking for it until maybe 5pm to give it time to get sorted and into the system.&nbsp; &nbsp;If there are any orders that had address problems or any other issues I will *definitely* be contacting those people today so that they can decide if they want their order shipped tomorrow or to cancel it.&nbsp; I think there&#039;s just one order like that, but I have to go through them now and make absolutely sure before dropping them off so that I don&#039;t miss anyone.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you&#039;re a one man show, you have to be your own double check system and I already double checked the quantities before sealing up the packs, now I am going to send out the confirmations to make sure that there&#039;s no one left unshipped at the end.&nbsp; I hope everyone is satisfied with this outcome and I guarantee you that it was the best I could do with only one person.<br /><br />I also got through around 1/3 of the pm&#039;s last night and I will be working on them a LOT today so a whole lot of people should be getting replies today as I am pretty quick at answering pm&#039;s.<br /><br />I hope everyone has a great day and I will continue to update the status until all the pm&#039;s are answered and there&#039;s nothing left pending.&nbsp; If you just have a comment for Ben, pls send that to his Forum account under &quot;BadBen&quot; and not to the general Pharmville pm in box as that will allow me to answer the questions about pending issues and any problems a lot faster.&nbsp; Thanks!<br /><br />I hope everyone has a great day,<br />Alex<br />
