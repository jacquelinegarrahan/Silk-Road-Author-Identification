				So I xferred bitcoins to my Silk Road address<br />14K5txMuPXM6kDC3W5ZTmg5qzGA6Z8n5qY <br />4+ hours ago.&nbsp; In blockchain.info and block explorer it shows the coins already in there and confirmed!&nbsp; This address is a year old so is it possible it&#039;s corrupt?&nbsp; I know Silk Road users can send me coins by my name but it looks like transferring to my address is not happening.&nbsp; This was $300 worth so if someone could help me I&#039;d be very grateful.

				you can change the value they charge you to hold &amp; dispense your coins just move the offer to 0.000200 and you will have your coins usually in 5 minutes but if you don`t offer to pay a little for there services then you will be waiting forever

				when you send bitcoins, it is optional to include a fee for the bitcoin miners that confirm the transactions. the fee is usually very small, but the higher the fee, usually the faster the transaction will go thru.

				Why use the service if it takes that long? What about just using MT Gox it takes like 2-3 hours for a transfer, I&#039;m guessing for security or to stay anonymous?

				old SR address are &quot;supposed&quot; to work, but most members who report having issues such as coins not appearing when they should evidently are using them it seems<br /><br />generally think its best to click get new address to reduce the risk of these problems&nbsp; <br /><br />might need to contact SR support, not sure if it will resolve itself but there are a couple other threads on the forum that me be of help first

				SR support is busy, they cant respond instantly to every message - just have a little patience <br /><br />your money isnt lost as long as you used a correct address to your acct, even if it was old<br /><br />please just post one thread about a certain topic in the most appropriate category

				Yes you&#039;re right microRNA I shouldn&#039;t &quot;spam&quot;<br /><br />but it&#039;s been nearly 24 hours and no response from the SR support team.&nbsp; Im sure you can understand I feel like I lost $300 which can be about a lot of anxiety.<br /><br />But you say I will receive my money which makes me feel better.

				When I was researching how SR works I found every detail pretty much step by step and had no problems. Maybe you should read everything again and I can&#039;t stress enough to take your time as this can be very confusing for beginners.&nbsp; :) Best of luck to you. <br />ML

				Did you get them yet, OP? I had sent coins roughly around the same time as you. I know this because mine were taking quite awhile to come through and so I checked the forums to see if something was up and I saw your new post. Mine took quite a few hours to come through, but did eventually make it. I think there were other posts mentioning it was unusually slow that day. Hope it works out for you. I&#039;m curious what&#039;s the longest people have waited for a transfer to SR to go through?
