				<br />Ok this is a multi part post so bear with me (And I have done alot of searching before making this post so be nice)<br /><br />I’m going on a trip around europe. I’m hoping I can use Silk Road while i’m away to source party drugs, mostly mdma, cocaine and maybe hash if I can’t find it easily. I figure it would be much easier and more reliable to use SR rather than scoring stuff off the street. How do the prices on silk road for european vendors compare with street prices?<br /><br />I figure I can have stuff sent to my hostel or use post restante, unless someone has a better suggestion?<br /><br />All my orders would be within europe, are there any countries that I should avoid ordering from, ie if i’m in Portugal would it be a bad idea to order from the netherlands or germany? <br /><br />I’ll be travelling via trains and buses and will probably have small amounts of stuff on me, is it common for police to use sniffer dogs at borders or within countries to check buses/trains? Or would it be safer to just mail stuff to myself at my next destination.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br />

				The only flaw I see with your plan is the estimated times in transit.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest you to consume everything every time you cross a border, because although &quot;drug sniffs&quot; aren&#039;t occurring very often, they still do happen.<br /><br />Because if you&#039;re going to move around a lot and if you have a schedule then some shipments can come late and can really mess up your plans, because you can&#039;t consume it all in time or you have to leave before it arrives in the first place.<br /><br />SR really isn&#039;t imo for quick transactions and people who are on the move. For me it&#039;ll be the stress that would get me, because sometimes packages to get lost and dealing with all the drama of resolving, while you know that you have to leave the place you are at.<br /><br />I would only consider using SR as your hook-up in Europe if you&#039;re either:<br />*ordering from the same country you are in<br />*you have more time than 1-2 weeks in your &quot;spot&quot;<br /><br />Otherwise you can really can get screwed for €.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

But only in places that I will be staying for a week or so.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">use domestic only</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So is ordering domestic the best way for europe? I thought that it would be relativley safe ordering from within the EU. Its a little annoying because it seems like 90+% of vendors are in UK, Germany and Netherlands.

				I live in EU myself, well North-East Europe.<br />Usually packages get to me in like ~5-10 days(from EU). There can always be delays.<br />Domestic should be next day/max 3 days.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Come to Ireland!! Yeah session on! We have a few domestic vendors on here too supplying most of what you&#039;d usually find! Same thing in every country would be the same, just use your current domestic location to post to and it will be safe as it ever will be!
