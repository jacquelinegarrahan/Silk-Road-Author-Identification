				Friends, it has come to my attention that there are doubters and paranoid users spreading unfounded accusations and inferences about the security and lifespan of SR. <br /><br />Please allow me to dispel the nonsensical bullshit that is being smeared throughout the website. SR will not go anywhere anytime soon. It has become clear to me that any attempts to take down or compromise the security of SR has been futile. I type this 4 years since SRs conception. <br /><br />The recent FH takedown has shook the foundations of TOR. It has taken may of us by surprise and has been the biggest security blow that TOR has taken in its lifespan. However t is clear to me that if you are using your security wisely then you have not to worry. If you are unaware of the best security practices then please refer to the Security forum, and allow me to breakdown a few essentials for you.<br /><br />1. Encrypt, Encrypt, Encrypt.<br />Use PGP or GPG for communicating sensitive information on SR and life in general. It is not possible for anyone to intercept this information if you follow instructions correctly (use search now if you don&#039;t know ho - Privnote is not enough anymore). This alone would have quenched any worry about using Tormail in the past and will protect you even if SR is infiltrated.<br />2. Use a couple of burner wallets before sending btc to your account.<br />3. Always be smart about withdrawing btc from your SR account and consider leaving it there if it&#039;s less than a couple of hundred bucks. <br />4. Change up forum accounts if you are dealing with large amounts of orders here.<br /><br />It has become clear that SR will not die out. It is the strongest and most well connection underground drugs website on the net. The idea has become mainstream and there are many many similar underground markets emerging (however you see this as good or bad it is the reality). All mail cannot be intercepted. All TOR networks remain anonymous if you are careful. This proves that the torch of mail order will never die. If anything happens to SR it will merely be passed on to the next person and the next one after that. It is clear that there are enough marketplaces on TOR and the clearnet to satisfy our needs. They cannot all be closed and efforts will be lost and discouraged for police that have limited resources. <br /><br />If you are a vendor then considering moving to a counrty with decriminalised laws to avoid criminality and improve likelyhood of leniar penalties if caught. So long as there are countries that do not share the same draconian laws as the US/NSA etc. then it is impossible to stop SR. Warrants will be ignored and resources wasted for trying to stop us. The energy behind this steam train is too powerful.<br /><br />Keep calm and stay safe. Read, educate and learn from the forums if you are new.&nbsp;

				Why does it matter my friend?<br />Soon or later LE will bring SR down but then, 10 new web-markets will rise up from the ashes.<br /><br />It&#039;s the beginning of the revolution!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br /><br />BPM

				Hey mate, <br /><br />Although I think its good to dream... Theres really no knowing... Its really not as simple as you make it out to be, and just because SR hasnt been compromised/taken down yet, that doesnt mean it wont...<br />I hope you understand that the risks are real.<br />Simple enough to make your own judgements, but shit can get real in an instant...<br /><br />Although I do strongly beleive, the net is (one of) the futures of the drug trade.<br />The idea has been put out and has been put to work. We will prevail.

				IMO the road is going NOWHERE anytime soon....It has been around for SO long and the DEA and HLS accounced SO long ago (over two years ago) that they were dedicating every resourced to shutting down the &quot;most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online&quot; That was over TWO years ago. Since then, the site has done nothing but improve drastically! I remember a year ago how slow this site was and it ALWAYS timed out, now there are hundreds of times more users and the site runs just as fast as my regular internet, it has handled every single attack thrown at it and it just continues to grow bigger and stronger every day. If they had a way to take it down it would have been done well over a year ago and security just keeps getting better on here.....I bet hundreds of people sign up here a day.<br /><br />I know my only problem as a vendor is I have trouble staying in stock sometimes as their are so many customers!

				This is the best place on the TOR network and the internet as a whole!&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t buy here very often but I do stick around because of the community here.
