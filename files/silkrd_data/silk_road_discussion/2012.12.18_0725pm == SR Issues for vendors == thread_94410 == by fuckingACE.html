				Ok, Before you guys start working yourselves up into some mad frothy frenzy screaming about how much you love the site and want to burn ad crucify anyone that has a bad thing to say about it.. Let me just say one thing, I love this site. But there are however problems with it. So I want to know if it safe for me to sell on here. I don&#039;t want conjecture or reams of people repeating the same thing. I take my freedom seriously. So please only reply if you have learn t to hold your own opinions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ok I want to know the following:<br /><br />Could the most recent attack (the phishing images on products) be LE harvesting BTC addresses. <br /><br />Could the last DDos have been LE<br /><br />Is it safe to list products on here and if so, how can I mitigate the current attack on my listings? ma by not include fotos or something?<br /><br />Should we all be holding off until DPR tells us whats what?<br />&#039;<br />Should we be thinking that there is a big enough problem to stop using this site altogether?<br /><br />Now my 2 cents.. Vendors fees went up a&nbsp; fold amount, I know this attack is not DPRÂ´s fault, but I also think that when you ask for more money from your customers you have to offer a better product.. The money we are paying in fees and commission needs to correspond directly to the quality of the anonymous sales platform that DPR is offering. Both in features and security. I do not currently feel this is the case, so as a paying customer I would like DPR to please sort it out. The same as when I go and buy a car with a flat tyre I expect them to fix it.. Simples. <br /><br />ACE<br /><br /><br />

Instead of being &#039;&#039;thankfull &#039;&#039; for that you hear all screaming&nbsp; <br />SR IS GREAT, SR IS GOOD, SR IS WONDERFUL....DPR IS FUCKING GOD<br />If/when DPR is still running this show (what I doubt) he better get his shit together and really invest so it will work as it should.<br />I LEAVE, TAKING MY CLIENTS WITH ME
