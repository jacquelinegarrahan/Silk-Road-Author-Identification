				ok heres my story<br /><br />i purchased an item with international tracking.&nbsp; i was required to FE (stupid i know, i don&#039;t wanna hear it :p)<br /><br />so i purchase, he marks it &quot;in transit&quot;, i FE.. a few days pass and i receive no tracking number, even though on his vender page it states he supplies tracking numbers right after he confirms the purchase.&nbsp; so i write him asking kindly for my tracking info.. i don&#039;t receive any reply whatsoever...every i check his vender page it says &quot;last online: today&quot; so i guess hes just ignoring me?<br /><br />what are my options at this point?

				It&#039;s hard to tell. Give it a few more days. You know you should never have FE so no need to point that out. He might just be busy. Go to your &quot;Sent Msgs&quot; and see if he has even read your msg.

				so who do i talk to if i don&#039;t receive any communication or product?<br /><br />i mean it should be easy to prove he did not ship anything if he cant supply the tracking number which i paid for , so i should have a prob getting my money back.. right or no?

				If you FE&#039;d you can&#039;t get your money back, at least SR support can&#039;t do that for you unfortunately. <br />Try to communicate with him again, if he doesn&#039;t respond change your feedback, if he doesn&#039;t respond again its time to report him on Scam thread. But be sure to give him enough time, and for your product to arrive. When did you order?

				Hey buddy,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if you FE&#039;d (which you said you did), the SR team will not be able to do anything.&nbsp; They specifically say in that post everyone can get to from their account page, that IF YOU FE THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP you.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know it sucks, and I am very sorry to hear you might have gotten scammed, but unless you completely trust the vendor, NEVER FE... EVER.<br /><br />I personally refuse to buy anything that &quot;requires&quot; FE (I know some very legitimate vendors require FE sometimes, so this is just a personal rule I go by)&nbsp; I know sometimes vendors are running short on cash on hand because of all of their money being tied up in escrow, but still you have to realize the nature of the business and the website.&nbsp; The reason SR is so successful is because it offers you a safety net (escrow) to place a &quot;buffer&quot; between you and the vendor ( and also works as a safety net for the vendor, since he/she doesn&#039;t know you from adam)<br /><br />I hope you get what you ordered, but if you don&#039;t... well it will just have to be taken as a fairly pricey lesson learner.<br />-AAfive<br /><br />PS:&nbsp; I have FE&#039;d before, but I wasn&#039;t asked to, and it was a vendor I had done business with on numerous occasions.&nbsp;

				At least;<br />&nbsp;edit your review of the vendor -&gt; account -&gt; view feedback -&gt; edit<br />&nbsp;Post a review under vendor&#039;s thread, if he has one. Do a search in the Rumor Mill section. Top right corner.<br />&nbsp;Report the vendor in the scammers post in the Rumor Mill section.<br /><br />You can&#039;t help what happened but you can help others.<br />Everyone gets taken at some time, hopefully we learn from it.

A few days is more than adequate to have waited for the tracking number and/or replies to your messages, however I would say given you have fe&#039;d if this does turn to shit as you know there&#039;s not much you can do about it.

				yea im not so much pissed because i knew what i was doing when i FE.. <br /><br />its been 7 days since i ordered and his page says he sends the tracking order right away after he confirms the transaction..<br /><br />&nbsp;well its been about 7 days now and every day i log in to his vender page it says he was last online &quot;today&quot; so he is just ignoring me at this point.. <br /><br />&nbsp;its funny i have ordered from him in the past without any tracking info, but i got my product.. <br /><br />what makes me mad is the lack of communication..<br /><br />if i dont get the product i will reveal him on these forums, but until then he has the benefit of the doubt<br /><br />im afraid to edit the feedback this early as i dont want to piss him off if he hasn&#039;t sent me the product yet... lol<br /><br />lesson learned i suppose :)
