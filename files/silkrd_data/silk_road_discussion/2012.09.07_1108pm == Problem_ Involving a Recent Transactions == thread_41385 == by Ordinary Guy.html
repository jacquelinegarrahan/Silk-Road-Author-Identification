				There are numerous reasons that can cause a delay. Probably a case of a lot of transactions needing to be verified by the network.<br />You can check pending transactions in the network by going here - This is a clearnet site - ( http://blockchain.info/) and then searching for your address. If the transaction is listed here then it&#039;s a matter of waiting until it gets included in a block before it will show in your client.&nbsp; :)<br />

				<br />from there FAQ<br />Where is my money?<br />&nbsp;<br />If you have made an order and are unable to locate the payment into your account then please check your emails first - for some exchanges (e.g MTGox) we are unable to make direct deposits and instead email coupon codes. If you are unable to locate this email or have other concerns then we urge you to contact support straight away with as much detail about the transaction as possible so that we can investigate.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you merely need to track a payment please put the OrderID into the form on our homepage to get the current status.<br /><br />or are you talking about after you tranfereded it to your SR wallet<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
