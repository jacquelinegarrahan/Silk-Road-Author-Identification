				My friend is about to start a job that test frequently for the typical drugs that people do. I wanted to hook him up with a little Methylone and he is wondering if this will show, and if so, for what drug. Thanks people of the road!

				I believe it could show up as mescaline, not that this is something on a 5 or 7 panel, but they certainly need to know which test they will be taking. Now before I get blasted for this I said I believe, which I had read off a post from the Doc a couple of days ago and if memory serves correct he said the chemical compound is more similar to mesc than the mdma which it is passed for..

				A guarantee it will create no false positives. My close friend gets drug tested all the time via his parole.

				i&#039;ll second what La Blue is saying; buy an at home test kit and try it out for yourself. <br /><br />If you in a situation where your being scrutinized, stay safe and just abstain. <br /><br />For what its worth, bk-mdma is so easy to import and cheaper than amph. no one is going to blend the two and call it methylone, the other way around.....maybe. occam&#039;s razor.

				Thank you La Blue Girl. I will be looking at that. It sucks how some test it will show, and other ones it don&#039;t. I guess he should do some research on exactly WHAT test is administered. <br />I believe you had a positive. I also believe others that said they were clean on theirs. It&#039;s the test that the place uses that determines what comes up as positive or negative. It&#039;s good to know that some DO show positive, while others come out negative.

				I checked out the test. Very cheap and looks accurate. Thanks for the 411. I&#039;ll have him buy 2. One for when he&#039;s coming down off M1, another a week later to see what is reads. Good lookin!

				I used to be under the impression (from an unreliable source) that Methylone could test positive for amphetamines. A bunch of people convinced me otherwise until I saw this thread.

The reason being methylone is 100% out of your system(except for hair) in 1-2 days MAX!!!!! With daily use it can last up to 3 days MAX!!!<br /><br />So it couldn&#039;t have been the bk-mdma. It had to have been something else you had done. Maybe your drinking water was contaminated. Maybe your test got switched with someone else&#039;s. Maybe one of the sheriffs didnt like you so he did some amphetamine and pissed in your cup. Doesn&#039;t matter because it is impossible that bkmdma would have any remnant in the body as you said 9 days later!!!!<br /><br />Blksheep we&#039;r done here,<br />Chaos 8)
