				Okay so here is a list of&nbsp; Psychedelics i have done in the past few months and how i felt on them. please share some of your&nbsp; Psychedelic Experiences how much you took, weight, and how you felt.&nbsp; i weigh 183 pounds and i am 6 foot one inch<br /><br />LSD- took about 10 hits this month, dropped 6 at once the other day at about 830 am PST , it hit me so hard i had to stop doing my job(tech support over the phone and on computer for verizon){i do my job on all kinds of&nbsp; Psychedelics. most of the time} by 915 am i could not see straight so i took a bath as i was sitting in a ball in the corner of my bath waiting for the water to get warm i was feeling and fighting with the fears of death something i do when my mind is having a hard time dealing with&nbsp; Psychedelics i have taken. as the water got warm and the bath began to fill&nbsp; i was starting to enjoy myself it felt like a being born again into water it was very intense for a few minutes (felt like a lifetime tho)&nbsp; but 945am i was up and ready to go day tripping&nbsp; got my 3 half wolf huskeys and went for a hike before i got out of car i took other 4 tabs and went to hike in the snow to this rope swing i made over a river about 30 min drive and 20 min hike from where i live. my puppies had a great time for about a hour or so running and playing in the water while i was swinging and being a child =]. after i felt good enough from taking other tabs i got ready to go home frozen to the core because i was in the snow and wearing skateboarding shoes ha i felt sober enough to drive back home. after a long day of mind fucking myself and questioning everything i think do and feel. i was ready to smoke some weed and relax so i do just that. and then fell asleep about 1130 pm.<br /><br /><br />25c NBOMe - I really have been abusing this drug and just stopped, i have had over 50 tabs to myself this last month and a half. This drug is really fun minus the violent come up. i take anywhere from 3 to 5 tabs at once of 1000 ug do not take that much unless you have been dealing with the drug and know how it makes you feel. my wife had a very bad trip on these the other day... but to each is own. i really love this drug its super fun feels like MDMA during the come up and then you get pretty cool visuals also keeps you pretty&nbsp; clear headed also could be a Psychedelic i take everyday if i did not have some control. because its very cheap to buy. but if you have never tried give it a chance.<br /><br />DMT - Like i have said before there is not even words for this one DMT is beautiful and always sakes me to my very core. i try to keep a gram handy in case it ever turns into one of those times that DMT is supposed to be used. this month alone i have smoked about 200mg am saving the rest for new years. I love Sharing DMT with people that have never tried it and hearing what they think... my 1st time i smoked DMT and blasted off to the muti verse i could only see energy and what a beautiful sight that was. PLEASE SHARE ALL DMT&nbsp; Psychedelic Experiences i love hearing stores...<br /><br /><br />Psilocybin - I ate about 7 grams of mushrooms on my birthday this year on Dec 6th that is and it was very fun. i have had my fell on them when i was a youth tho i ate to many all the time so i only do these about once a year. but once i was 16 and i took about 30 grams at once and man there is not even words if some one has for that kind of shroom trip please share with me. =]<br /><br />Mescaline - I have never had but about to get some and try some Please share with me what you guys think of it if you have tried<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I made a small cup with my right hand, had a small puddle of liquid LSD in it, kinda like I caught some rain drops from the roof in a storm.&nbsp; <br />I put the puddle in my mouth and proceeded to walk into Disneyland in Anaheim CA with 6 others.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember space mountain, and I remember my friend completely losing it and being paralyzed.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I remember dosing at our apt. in Northern California.&nbsp; I remember buying the bottle of whisky.&nbsp; I remember struggling to get away<br />from the people calling the cops on me and running.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember everything else since then because I haven&#039;t dosed.&nbsp; errr...&nbsp; To each their own.&nbsp; I was young and a bit crazy...&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; I had many good trips.&nbsp; But too often I mixed with other substances and did really dumb things.&nbsp; I don&#039;t regret any of it.<br />And when I say to each their own, I mean I never, ever judge anyone for their choices.&nbsp; I am not afraid to admit the stupid choices I made.<br />I do hope I am not judged because of them.

				I had a breakthrough trip on salvia this past summer. Don&#039;t remember it that well, sort of like a half-remembered dream. I do remember being in a completely different reality. I tried as hard as I could to see real reality but it wasn&#039;t possible. My mouth kept slowly opening and something was trying to climb out. I kept closing it though so it couldn&#039;t get out. I wonder to this day if I was sitting there in my chair slowly opening and closing my mouth (I was alone so no idea). When I finally came back to reality I was very euphoric and happy. It was not a frightening or bad experience in any way (never had a bad salvia experience personally). I would say this was a level 5 trip on the scale.<br /><br />I also had a salvia trip that wasn&#039;t quite breakthrough, this one was probably a level 4. With my eyes open and focusing my mind on reality I could live in reality but when I closed my eyes and let my mind wander I would be transported to an open deck on the back of a house an a tropical beach. Again euphoric and happy.<br /><br />My other experiences with salvia I didn&#039;t experience hallucinations, just a strong high and the usual strange salvia body high (which has never bothered me).

				dmt has shown me facets of reality i never would have been aware of otherwise. i always feel rejuvenated and energized after smoking dmt, almost like taking a long nap. i find it very healing... never fails to wash away negativity and restore balance within me. god bless the spice of life. without it, who knows where i&#039;d be? :)

				Cooking and eating bacon on lsd, one of the most delicious things I&#039;ve ever experienced. It&#039;s odd because usually I can&#039;t stomach anything when I&#039;m tripping, but this one particular time...<br /><br />Of course that&#039;s not really the most amazing thing that&#039;s ever happened to me while on lsd! But it was strange! :P

				Iv only taken Shrooms and just today got in my first 2 hits of LSD,SO super excited to try but kinda nervous..<br /><br />Shrooms- I was still a Teen and me and some buddies went to a field we knew had cows and the farmer wasnt feeding them the Chemicals that fuck up the whole process ..Anyway its about 4 of us out in a huge field about 3:00am with little flash lights and brown bags . We all were about a hour or 2 into collecting when out of nowhere a fucking shot gun goes off and we hear bird shot hitting the damn trees beside us, so at this point we all felt it was time to leave..lol.. So we all go back to where it was we were hanging out washed the shrooms off, I didnt know about shroom tea then so i just poured some Ranch on 3 or 4 caps and down the hatch they went..<br /><br />Well about we all decided to take a walk down the dirt road we were staying beside which also was right dead on the river and it was a full moon..So everybody else starts speaking of how there effects are kicking in and im getting super pissed at this point, well about 15min later i sit back on the dock we decided to relax on and i look up, and as soon as i do ZOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! its like the full moon came right dowin front my face so i could almost climb up on it, So sitting there with a shit eat grin on my face for a good hour in the pitch black other than from the light under the moon and stars we decide to get up and go back to our chill out spot, I remember one guy with us had never ever done any drug or anything before and some how we talked him into shrooms and the house we were in had some remodeling going on so there was wood chips and debree all over the floor and out the blue the kid starts Freaking out and running around yelling; There after me!!!&#039; the ninja chips are coming for me!!! LMAO!! any way this is the first time i bother&#039;d to take notice of the floor and needless to say there were no Ninja wood chips but the shredded wood from saws did look fucking awesome and it look like they were just moving around. After sitting around all laughing and Bullshitting we decide to load into a Van and take a ride, I think it must have been dec or later in the winter cause i had a blanket on me in the back cause there was no heat.. Well shortly after putting the blanket on me it started to feel almost like it began to melt to me and i started melting into the Van seats.. I cant remember where the hell we went or what we did, next thing that pops in my mind is me parting my way and getting into my truck and driving home, and when i pulled up i just sat there and stared at my Cd player lights for a good 30min or so and finally went in and some how got to sleep. The next day i remember feeling kinda depressed and felt like shit!! But after a Hot shower a xanax and a 40MG OC all that went away.. I hope to come back and share a good story about my LSD i just got today as well..

				One of the times; we&#039;re tripping out, driving down the highway, listening to music, laughing our asses off and a state trooper pulls us over, he probably thought something was up.&nbsp; We are tripping like crazy and when he comes up to the car window its like it just shut off, everyone was totally straight, I gave him my license and registration, he comes back, everything is ok, we pull off tripping our brains out again, that was wild.<br />Another time I had already dropped like 4 or 5 hits before noontime and I&#039;m going down the road and see this giant praying mantis head peeking over a bridge looking at me, I&#039;m like &#039;whoa&#039;, but I kept on going, kinda looking out the corner of my eye seeing if it was gonna do anything. That was nuts.<br />Whats really wild is when your handing paper out to people and just by handling it so much you get to tripping without actually doing any.&nbsp; You handle it enough and you do literally get a contact high.
