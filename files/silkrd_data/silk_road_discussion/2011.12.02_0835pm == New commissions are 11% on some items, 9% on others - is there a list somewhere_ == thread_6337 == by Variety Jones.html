				My prices are all fucked up - things I had listed for 62 bucks are now 64.58.<br /><br />The new commission seems to be a sliding scale - an item I list at $50.00 totals out to $55.50 - or 11%.<br />$100.00 listings go to $109.00 or 9%<br />$200.00 listings go to $216.00 or 8%<br /><br />As someone who lists competitors pricing and sells for exact amounts, the secret sliding commission scale is making rather difficult to make sure the final price is the one I want to charge.

				Do you recall when SR wanted to double the commission fee, but didn&#039;t when all the vendors protested? I think the resulting decision was that he was going to implement this sort of proportional commission but I&#039;m pretty disappointed that he didn&#039;t announce it. Instead he just changes it and lets us deal with not only figuring out what&#039;s going on but how to manage it.

				..another seller commented...&quot;waiting for thousands (of $$&#039;s) to clear...&quot;....would as much as 10% count or matter....

				When I asked if the commission fee was changed SR replied &quot;We did change it briefly, but it is back to how it was before now. We are going to make a few changes, but you will be made aware before we do next time.&quot;
