				I believe the DragonCove on BMR is a scam artist.<br /><br />I purchased personal quantities regularly from DragonCove. My last order was supposedly shipped on tuesday sept 24th. His orders ALWAYS arrive 2 days later. His vendor account was downgraded or suspended that thrusday or friday (26th or 27th). I still have not received my order or any communication from DC. I have a feeling he was caught or was a fed vendor. I also have now had two other orders that have not showed up that were due to be delivered a last week. Both orders were for personal amounts and I have only ever ordered personal amounts of anything. So either all three vendors were busted or because of one vendor bust my shipping address has been &quot;compromised&quot;. all over orders of two grams, a few suckers, and a copy of windows 8 OS disk.

				Also, he messaged me Tuesday morning the day my order was to be shipped out and said he just changed his PGP key yesterday and asked me to send it to his new one. I did, then deleted the key. Was all VERY strange to say the least...<br />
