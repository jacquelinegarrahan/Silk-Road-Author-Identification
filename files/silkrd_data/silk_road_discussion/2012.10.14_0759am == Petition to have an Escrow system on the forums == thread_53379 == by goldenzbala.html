				Why should SR provide an escrow service for non vendors to sell things? If it&#039;s for sale from a vendor you can use escrow, if it&#039;s not a vendor don&#039;t buy from them :)

				You guys are HARSH!! Although funny too. <br /><br />I think goldenzbala just isn&#039;t clear on how SR and the SR forum work. So yeah, what he asks is at best ignorant, at worst stupid (which is funny either way) <br /><br />goldenzbala - you should never do &quot;business&quot; with anyone on an anonymous forum. This is where you are posting right now. There is no accountability or trust, you may as well throw your money to out the door and hope the wind blows it back in. <br />The actual SR site is the only place you can (somewhat) safely make reputable business transaction with registered vendors. <br /><br />Also, the Silk Road admin has to get paid so doing transactions offsite is not allowed.

				If the forums get escrow, it should have a 25% flat-rate fee. Buy a vendor account for a better rate, or be a douchebag forum scammer and get fucked in the ass.<br /><br />Perfect solution! :D Rate might be too low, though.

				You&#039;re right. A 50% fee would be better. 25% goes to the support-team, 25% to the Road, and 50% is what the vendor is left with. :D

				The SilkRoad Marketplace is the place to sell and purchase. The SilkRoad Forum is the place to discuss whatever. If you want to become a vendor pay the fee, get a vendors account, pay DPR his well deserved commission on all of your sales, and conduct your business properly. If you you choose to conduct &#039;business&#039; from this forum, in the name of trying to scam DPR out of his vendors account fee/comission, and you get scammed as a result, you only have yourself to blame. goldenzbala, you are a first class face palm.

				I didn&#039;t make my self clear enough. I meant on the armory forums. I know a few trust able vendors who have there own websites but are still unreliable and I do not use the ORIGINAL SR. The armory closed down so I assume all the business goes on the armory forums where people actually exchange tor emails and websites and also images so for the people who replied you&#039;re either an idiot or misunderstood. 0/-15 because of the elementary minded folks on these forums...

				Don&#039;t buy things on the forums! You are simply asking for it and going to get what&#039;s coming to you... which is probably nothing.<br /><br />There&#039;s an old adage that a fool and his money are soon parted. It seems to be especially relevant in onionland.

They would NOT have misunderstood you if you had posted this topic in the correct forum and mentioned that you meant &quot;escrow for The Armory forum&quot;. There is a reason that we have a number of separate forums rather than having every topic posted in one large forum - namely so that threads are categorised into their respective subject groups.<br /><br />You cannot claim that people here are elementary minded when you fail to give them the information that they need in order to know exactly what you mean. This is the Silk Road discussion forum, hence it is logical to presume that you were talking about an escrow system for this forum.&nbsp; ???<br />Please say you understand that, at least?!&nbsp; ???<br /><br />- grahamgreene
