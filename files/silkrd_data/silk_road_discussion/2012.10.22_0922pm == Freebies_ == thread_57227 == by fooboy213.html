				I do not have a vendor account.<br />I posted a thread seeing if there was interest in buying some precursors I have.<br />There does not appear to be enough interest to justify getting a vendor account to sell them due to the current cost of vendor accounts being much higher than I would receive from selling the precursors.<br /><br />Is it against the rules for me to offer these items for free or a &quot;buyer pay shipping&quot; type arrangement in the Product Offers forums without a vendor account?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m looking to find a good home for what may be useful to someone rather than struggle through potentially difficult disposal.&nbsp; I honestly could care less if I see a penny for them.<br /><br />If it is not welcome here, could anyone make any recommendations on where might be an appropriate forum?

				depending on the precursor, they are a particularly dangerous thing to give an address out for and accept <br /><br />instead of just a drug for personal use, it actually suggests that person is manufacturing - so a perfect way for LE to determine people of further interest<br /><br />just dont be surprised if you dont get much interest

				Not only what micro said, but you cant pony up $150 because it would not be worth it.<br /><br />So you are willing to take a risk and not even profit $150.<br /><br />Sounds fishy. I would advise all buyer to not deal with anyone who doesn&#039;t have a vendor account.<br />
