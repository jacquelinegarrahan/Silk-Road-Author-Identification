				Since SR is protected by escrow, should I feel safe buying from sellers without ratings? Are there any scamming possibilities that escrow is vulnerable to that I should be aware of?

				It is always possible for a vendor to create fake ratings by &quot;buying&quot; his on stuff. So better ask for a small quantity, just because there is an escrow system it does not mean you get all your btc back if you are scammed. Am I wrong? Correct me!

				correct.&nbsp; You &quot;may&quot; and I stress may get all your btc back if a trade with a new seller does not work.&nbsp; But it is also possible that the complaint is resolved by dividing the escrow funds 50/50.

				There is nothing wrong with new vendors and many may be great vendors in the end.&nbsp; The one rule with a new vendor is to start small, order a sample or two of their various products and rate them based on your experience and quality of product.&nbsp; Then slowly move up to larger quantities once you feel you have enough trust.

				The other thing that new sellers can do (and, so far, haven&#039;t seen a lot of) is offering discount samplers and advertising this in the Product Offer subform.&nbsp; That&#039;d be the best way to quickly legitimize yourself.

				It&#039;s kind of a catch 22.&nbsp; We are afraid to buy from new sellers, but if no one buys from them they will never get ratings and become established.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest sending them a message and discussing your purchase as well as purchasing a small quantity to start.&nbsp; Get a feel for the seller to determine if you are comfortable buying from them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had positive experiences with established sellers as well as new sellers by simply getting a feel for them before purchasing.
