				I think this is a good step towards adding some disincentive towards scammers trying to advertise through SR.&nbsp; I think maybe we should go a step further and add some rules about sellers stating that they only accept payments outside the escrow system.<br /><br />Question: will any of the bid amounts be released to the &#039;SR public&#039;?&nbsp; Just out of curiosity.

				I would suggest seeing the demand of new seller accounts. If there is high demand for new seller accounts it may be good to allow more per period. This is after all a free market which probably would be bad to limit SR to those who can afford to be in the vendor club.<br /><br />The problems I could see arising would be vendors who can&#039;t pay up to join, and will try to do deals outside of the system. It&#039;s not a good idea if you&#039;re a buyer, but if the vendor can provide a price point that is too good to pass up to the buyer, they could circumvent the system. Just my $.02.<br /><br />I do believe it&#039;s good to limit the number of new vendors but you should definitely consider the demand for new seller accounts, and evaluate if changes need to be made.<br /><br />Keep up the good work SR.

				This is a good step.&nbsp; L.E.&#039;s main mechanism for getting involved will be on the seller side, since the buyer side is the weakest in terms of information.&nbsp; Also it will discourage scammers from getting into the game (although I&#039;m sure it&#039;s already pretty hard to scam inside of the escrow structure - any transaction outside of escrow has nothing to do with SR and the responsibility lies solely on the participants).<br /><br />It would also be interesting to see what the bidding is up to.&nbsp; If a seller is serious, he&#039;s not going to mind throwing down a few bitcoins to get into the game and you are more likely to get sellers who have good sources (or are their own source) providing services and products.&nbsp; This will increase the overall quality of goods on SR, which is of course to the benefit of the customers.<br /><br />Bottom line - I like it!

				while it initially seems like a good system (certainly better than nothing/no new sellers), i dont really understand what this system is supposed to accomplish wrt LE, firstly what i don&#039;t get is<br /><br />1.) what good would LE have to create fake buyer accounts? e.g. they&#039;d be going after buyers, which seems like it would be more work than its worth (so you busted some kid for getting a personal supply).&nbsp; is this really the approach we think LE will take ? wouldn&#039;t it be more profitable to try to a.) take out the sellers firstly or if not, take the site offline<br />2.) what&#039;s to stop LE from bidding high enough to create seller accounts?<br /><br />or am i misunderstanding the approach with respect to LE (or is this purely to make sure sellers trying to do business on SR are just legit and not scammers)

				The way I see it, You arent able to provide the best product if you don&#039;t even have the money to pay for an account.<br />Not having money leads to poor products, poor packaging, and less care. Someone who pays for an account has an added devotion to their sales. People who like making money wouldnt spend money unless they knew they were going to provide their everything to make more. Maybe they are trying to clean up from the people trying to nickel and dime in a field that should have only the most dedicated selling. Let&#039;s be honest with ourselves, would you rather buy from someone who is going out to buy from their person once an order is made, or from someone who is full on dedicated and ready to sell to you in hand.

				To be honest I will not spend my bitcoins on an auction just to become a seller here so I can be scammed further by having sent my product to fake addresses provided by fake buyers. Or buyers who claim they newer got my package and with the help of the escrow system&nbsp; get their money back while I lost my product and paid for the postage or else, I get a negative rep.<br /><br />Sellers are the one who needs protection, not the buyers who are protected by the escrow system and the rep system, both favors the buyers not the sellers.<br /><br />Sellers will try to find other ways outside SR if a pre-payment is needed.<br /><br />IMO it&#039;d be better to charge every transaction with a minimal amount of bitcoin this would take back on bogus buys.<br /><br />Unused seller accounts that never listed anything could be deleted, these are already being sold here and elsewhere.

				@JackDan<br /><br />The unfortunate truth of the matter is that the &quot;brick and mortar&quot; risk (artificial consequences imposed by moral legalists) lies entirely on the buyer.&nbsp; Unless you are flashing a driver&#039;s license when sending off your product, there is nothing to tie a seller to the outgoing package (other than city of origin, in which case you could make a bi-weekly trip to the nearest larger urban post office).&nbsp; The buyer assumes all of this risk, the risk to the seller is purely a financial one.<br /><br />This is the reason prices are a bit higher than on the street.&nbsp; The seller needs to cover shipping costs, packaging costs, and the off-chance that there are a few scam buyers on SR.&nbsp; That being said, I have 8 transactions so far and no one has tried to scam me yet (although 7 are still in transit thanks to the CP strike).

				I too hope that a referral system will be added as a way to gain a seller account, because this auction system would be disappointing in itself. It does seem to minimize the presence of scammers, especially if seller accounts are lost by people who receive too high a proportion of complains, but IMO enhances the presence of LE by relying completely on financial resources and not on a network of trust. If the only sellers wanted here are the biggest then I may as well sign out now. I don&#039;t plan to make my living by selling drugs, I just came here to sell a few obscure items I couldn&#039;t safely offer otherwise, pick up a few items I haven&#039;t been offered before and to see what might become of this novel new concept. Besides, my spending money has been invested in RCs, not bitcoins, so I would have to sell to buy a seller account. Maybe there needs to be another trading site for ordinary people like me. And I do see this as a trading site, since bitcoins seem to be primarily FOR drugs, at least at this point.

				This is bullshit, so some of us already with accounts who were going to turn into sellers now have to buy a seller account? All this will mean is every big seller will be law enforcment because they can afford to buy all the accounts. Seriously wtf silk road, you are basically setting up every single buyer to be caught in one massive web. I reckon this is just about silk road making more money. <br /><br />And what about sellers being scammed? Happens an awful lot more than you realize. If this is what silk road is doing now i may as well set up my own server you get me? For the price of an account i could buy some old hardware to make a web server. <br /><br />Jesus Christ this is shit. <br /><br />And yeah i know i don&#039;t got to sell here and all that stuff, just sayin it&#039;s a bad idea yeah.

				1 scammer can make 20 buyers account and make bogus buys, although if the price is deducted from his account when placing an order sounds much better, because every account will have to have some Bitcoins that will be on hold during the whole transaction.<br />I overlooked this one before, but still don&#039;t know if this is how it works on SR or not.<br /><br />So the seller can loose his product and postage cost every single time a transaction occurs (I doubt that a seller will take the buyers reputation points into account, because there are a lot of one time buyers and &quot;one nick name for one buy&quot; buyers). Or he loose his reputation.<br />The buyer can loose an address if something goes wrong (fake seller, LE).&nbsp; So what can the seller do with an address that might be:<br />- completely fake (in case the scammer&#039;s goal was to make the seller lose his product and postage cost)<br />- a safe address (unlinked to the buyer)<br />- the buyers home<br /><br />If there was just a small amount for personal use, the fake seller or LE might have opened a telephone book to point out a random address with much less effort than faking sells on SR, he has about the same chance to find something illegal in that random house he pointed at in the phone book, as in that address he got from the buyer.<br /><br />For bigger amounts nobody should use his own address IMO, but that is obvious.

				Oh and guys i don&#039;t think you considered something, if you have to buy an account you&#039;re no longer anonymous. When you purchase bitcoins you usually do it with a card, bank account etc. These coins can be tracked to see what you buy with them, if it&#039;s a silk road account then you&#039;re screwed. This is why bitcoin washing services exist, to disguise the connection between the individual coins and what they are used for. <br /><br />So buy your bitcoins in cash, with disposable credit cards or something else. <br /><br />This is a mistake silk road, and yeah i&#039;m pissed cause i wanted to sell and i have this kind of moral issue with buying an account to sell illegal shit. You guys could of at least given all existing accounts the option of upgrading to sellers for free. <br /><br />Oh and what if people buy accounts in large quantities and resell them? The same person winning every 48 hours, i&#039;m guessing silk road won&#039;t give a fuck, they make money anyway lol

				Even if one party decides to buy up all of the seller accounts and resell them, big deal!&nbsp; in the end, people with some money are able to pick up a seller account, it doesn&#039;t matter if it changes hands 2 times or a hundred.<br /><br />The LE excuse is just a weasly one as far as I&#039;m concerned.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure the bids aren&#039;t that high (it would be nice if SR could publish results - not users, mind you, just &quot;winning bid amount&quot; - to give the next round an idea of what to look for.)&nbsp; This would actually benefit SR I&#039;m pretty sure becuase the benchmark would climb for a while and there would be more BC coming in for the site.&nbsp; Even if LE is picking up accounts big deal.&nbsp; They don&#039;t bust buyers like they do sellers, and there is no link back to the seller anyway except through SR.<br /><br />As for purchasing bitcoins, it is an absolute must that you purchase them with an anonymous CC (prepaid gift card that requires no ID), or are generating them via a mining program.&nbsp; There are coin shuffling services out there too that let you mix in with a ton of other transactions so it&#039;s virtually impossible to link the origin of the coins.&nbsp; I believe SR already does coin mixing within the site but a second round wouldn&#039;t hurt.<br /><br />@Greenhamster - sounds like you are frustrated but it&#039;s no reason to flip out like 4chan kid.&nbsp; This is a new thing.&nbsp; SR just came out with it.&nbsp; As with everything else, I&#039;m sure he&#039;s open to suggestions (he has an entire forum section devoted to that), so positive results would probably be more attainable by stating the benefits of adding a service instead of throwing a type-tantrum and vomiting all over this forum.<br /><br />I think having an escrow fee on the buyer side makes sense&nbsp; Even 15% or something just to tamp constant scamming.&nbsp; A buyer rating system is ideal as well from a seller perspective, so that scammers can be flagged asap and the community can know about it - other than that if you are a seller and you have issues with a customer, post his username and your story in the Rumor Mill section of the forum - sellers check there all the time.<br /><br />As to the risks - a seller can be out his product, sure (I&#039;m not mitigating the financial liability at all).&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying that so far my experience has been solid so I dont&#039; have to jack my prices up to accomodate a 50% rip-off rate.&nbsp; There is also arbitration whereby SR will mediate a dispute.&nbsp; If you are a reputable seller chances are you are going to at least have your side of the story honestly considered.&nbsp; This whole thing is a work and progress and it seems to be off the ground solidly.&nbsp; There will be many kinks along the way and that&#039;s not counting personal security issues, just keep feeding in suggestions and hopefully the good ones will be adopted over time and we can have an even better, more secure and mutually-beneficial community than we do now.

				Good sellers and good buyers do fine...but as the man said: buyers take the huge legal risk, sending out addies...nothing else compares...escrow protects both sides...I haven&#039;t heard of bunch of fake buyers going to all this trouble, just to get a few btc refunded.&nbsp; &nbsp;The serious problem is fake sellers who take the btc and run...all you have to do is trot over to Black Market and see...this place works just fine and the owners are doing a good job, and the reason for the bidding is to prevent the bullshit sellers from hopping on here to make a free buck...again: the sellers hold the buyers address...there just aren&#039;t now, nor are there going to be, a bunch of people going to all&nbsp; this trouble, just to lie about not receiving product.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t receive product, and even so, I&#039;m hesitant to post negative feedback...this isn&#039;t ebay...we operate on the fringes of internet society, such as it is...and we presume a bit of goodwill, or we wouldn&#039;t be here...worrying about packs of bad buyers taking advantage of sellers..use gpg, pm each other, the auction is a great idea, that and the reputation/feedback...it&#039;s working...people are worried this will get like ebay with bad reps being posted..this isn&#039;t ebay, and there are some serious reasons buyers act right on here...

				in my opinion, seller accounts should be bought for an expensive amount (over a grand) ,and once they have proven themselves,they should be re-imbursed.that is the best way forward(IN MY OPINION)....well maybe not a grand,but 500 bucks at least..or maybe seller accounts should just be bought without re-imbursement....500 dollars a pop for a seller account....which is peanuts for a drug dealer but alot for a scammer....make this place a bit more upper class.lol<br /><br />buyers should only be allowed escrow on there 2nd go with a verified supplier...but escrow compulsory for all new sellers from the 1st go...that will protect old time sellers/verified sellers from people that just want to get goods without paying...<br /><br />so basically;<br /><br />verified sellers-buyers entitled to escrow on second purchase onwards<br />new sellers-buyers entitled to escrow on first purchase onwards<br /><br />so new sellers will be most at risk of getting scammed but that will soon subside once they have good feedback and get some rep behind them and move onto the verified seller status

With the recent surge of new members there are alot of potential buyers suddenly added to my circle. After 3 days I already have 59 btc in my account (not all profit and still in escrow but still). <br /><br />I think that if you have small quantities to sell youre better of selling it to your irl friends.

				And just to clarify, even simply SELLING the seller accounts would be better than this auction system (although I don&#039;t support that either for the same reasons).&nbsp; But at least with that the seller accounts would be available and (hopefully) reasonably priced for new sellers to be able to jump in without having to pay a premium auction price or having to wait around and hope they land an account.<br /><br />This auction thing just shuts the door in their faces.

				with utmost respect to g4bb3r, I think things have changed. A small number of idiots can ruin it for the rest of us. <br /><br />Small time and casual sellers are awesome. The problem is that it is hard to tell legitimate small timers from flakes and scammers.&nbsp; Maybe in the future Silk Road could have a per item price to allow for this. The point is that Silk Road has issues with big promises and less than stellar follow though. I do not want to see a few big sellers muscle out legitimate small timers. Even worse though is unreliable or untested people ruining the taste of Silk Road for new and potential buyers. Putting up $100 bucks to say &quot;I believe in myself&quot; is really not a lot to ask. Make it a refundable deposit based on good feedback if you want (thought the shill feedback system would have to be looked at).<br />

				Hi Everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m new here, obviously... I just heard about SR today, and sought it out. How marvelous. I feel like this is Diagon Alley in Harry Potter... OK, I&#039;m actually older than 30, so don&#039;t go thinking I&#039;m some knucklehead teen. Anyway, I wanted to comment about this new auction to upgrade to a seller account.<br /><br />&nbsp;As I see it, there are several issues that are trying to be dealt with here.<br />1) trying to keep the quality of goods for sale high, as opposed to having many sellers who are pushing junk or worthless items, so as to attract more buyers because the quality of the market here is high. <br />2) preventing a rapid surge of sellers who flood the market, creating &#039;chaos&#039; for buyers, increasing competition for sellers, driving down profit margins, which could discourage other sellers from competing, and making it more difficult for buyers to ascertain who are &#039;good&#039; sellers since many of them may have little or no feedback. <br />3) encouraging sellers who would sell on SR for a while, as opposed to the one-off seller who is here today, gone tomorrow, and contributes little to the community. <br /><br />I do not think that this should have any bearing on trying to weed-out bogus sellers who are looking to con someone, from the legitimate sellers honestly looking to do business, because the buyers are already protected by the escrow system. It would not be in the seller&#039;s best interest to try to pull a fast one regardless of whether they have paid to upgrade their account or whether they upgraded it for free. <br /><br />First, lets deal with the first point. I think that it is important that the goods sold on SR be of a caliber that would attract people to shop here. If a high percentage of the items for sale are believed to be low value, questionable quality, or &quot;junk&quot; items, it will not be in the buyer&#039;s interest to sift through the listings to find the few unique, rare, or high quality items available. I think that having a system in place, such as paying to upgrade your account to sell, would do well to keep the quality of goods on SR high, which is in the buyer&#039;s best interests, as well as the interest of the seller&#039;s who offer these quality, or difficult to obtain items.<br /><br />Second point: The fact that only one new seller is accepted every 24 hours means the community will grow slowly, and not spike with fly-by-night sellers who may not be around to help SR grow in a month or two. I think this is a good thing. But it also means that a potential seller might have to wait several days to become a seller, which makes it more difficult to become part of this system. So in addition to the &#039;auction&#039; method for a seller membership every 48 hours, I think it was a good idea to also have the ability to just &#039;buy&#039; a seller licensed account outright. I think that the fact that you have to purchase the account upgrade will limit the growth of sellers enough that there will not be a rapid influx of short-term sellers.<br /><br />Now, about the last point. I think that while SR is still in its infancy, it would be better to have committed sellers who build a good reputation here over several transactions, rather than many sellers with few transactions who perhaps have a brief history here before they disappear. To encourage that, I see how having a monetary contribution would mean that a seller would have to conduct several transactions to make back their investment, encouraging long-term relationships. <br /><br />But I think we&#039;d all agree it would be nice to see SR have MORE goods, not less, with MORE variety and diversity, be it from sellers in different locations around the globe, or in type of goods, or in quality of goods, or whatever. In order for that to happen, there needs to be MORE sellers. And I think that strictly speaking, the fact that one has to pay-to-play, so to speak, will turn away a certain number of possible sellers just for the fact that you are starting off at a loss before you even get going. <br /><br />So let me introduce a twist to the idea, and tell me what you think... the money you spend to upgrade your account is refunded. It could be a nominal refund, on a per-transaction basis. For every satisfactory transaction, 1 BTC or 0.5 BTC (whatever) is refunded. It could be that 100% of the original investment is refunded, or it could be that only part of the total investment will be refunded. That I&#039;ll leave up to the accountants of SR to decide how much profit margin they wish to keep. :o)<br /><br />The point is, it wouldn&#039;t seem so negative to pitch in 10 BTC to become a seller, if you thought that you would have some of that cost returned to you after each successful transaction (regardless of your profit margin). This would a) set up a good seller habits for new sellers, who are seeking satisfactory feedback on transactions to earn back their investment, and b) encourage longer term sellers if they realized that they would need to sell at least X amount of items to recoup their original investment cost. This would discourage people from signing up for seller accounts if they only wish to sell one or two items. This would also increase the average feedback of any given seller, since they would seek to stick around selling at least for enough transactions to recoup as much of their original investment as they could. And of course, that is better for buyers, because then a buyer would have more information to use to choose reputable sellers.<br /><br />Something to think about.

				The buyer is already protected in the current system with the escrow. The buyer will lose the opportunity to choose from a variety of sellers with this new auction system because it discourages small-time sellers (like myself) from starting out if they&#039;re forced to pay $100 or so to even start selling here. The ONLY PERSON who benefits from this new scheme is SR himself, as he&#039;ll be making probably close to $100 per day.

				My primary worry about this is that law enforcement have an unlimited budget to spend buying up all of the new seller accounts. Law enforcement HAVE spent TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars buying opiates from SINGLE (insecure) vendors prior to busting them. Dropping a hundred grand on monopolozing the new seller accounts is not out of the question for them. And I worry that although this system will combat scammers, it also puts a dollar value on law enforcement being the only ones with new seller accounts. And that is a price they are probably willing to pay if it results in SR turning into a massive reverse sting honeypot with no real vendors selling on it anymore. It could turn SR into a massive intelligence asset for the feds, and intelligence assets of that high a strategic importance are easily worth some big bucks to agencies with unlimited money (that they take from you via taxes, woot! Don&#039;t you just love being forced to pay for your own oppression?)<br /><br />I don&#039;t think SR is selling out, and in theory this is a good method to combat scammers, but in practice I think it is more or less equal to offering the site to the feds if the price is right.

				I don&#039;t see why everybody&#039;s arguing about LE and scammers. SR never said this new system will keep out LE. He never said it will keep out scammers. It&#039;s just a money grab on his part. So if you&#039;re trying to point out the new system won&#039;t do that, don&#039;t bother, he already knows.

				Money grab is fine and actually perfectly in line with Agorism considering nobody is forced to sell or buy here. However, I wish he would do his money grab in a way that isn&#039;t likely to result in the feds buying every new seller account. Selling out to the state is not compatible with Agorism, and I don&#039;t think that is what SR intends to do, but I do think that will be the end result. I suggest instead that you charge a % of each sale, and allow vendors to load an account that let&#039;s them cover the cost or the buyer cover the cost, or some combination. If you want to combat scammers, you should split sellers into ranks based on when they joined and their post counts and then make the ranks scarce by not letting new people trivially obtain them, then prune the ranks of scammers. This will result in scammer to legit ratio decreasing over time in favor of legit, but does not open up the very serious potential of law enforcement to legit ratio increased toward law enforcement over time.&nbsp; Silk roads best strategy is certainly to let anyone sell. It still favors law enforcement and scammers who can make a shit ton of malicious accounts for everyone who is legitimate, but at least it doesn&#039;t lock out legitimate people and open the door for law enforcement if they are willing to pay the price. Also, by splitting the members into ranks based on their join date and current reviews, you could probably limit law enforcement and scammers even more so, particularly if law enforcement did not start mass registration of accounts prior to the Gawker rush. Accounts should indeed be scarce commodities, however it is imo foolish to make the qualifier financial superiority, because this will certainly tilt things towards law enforcement rather than combating them.

Second most likely is that it is law enforcement PSYOP trying to get you to close registration. Third most likely it is actually a crazy person or maybe an anti-drug extremist who thinks drugs are already poison so who cares if they cut them with poison. The third threat is pretty serious, but making accounts costly wont prevent a determined extremist. Test kits are helpful but they are actually not likely to be enough to detect low dose poisons. To really combat this drugs need to be GC/MS tested at least, NMR is another option. Unfortunately most people don&#039;t have access to this sort of analytical equipment, and it isn&#039;t very safe to have a go to guy who gets products from every single vendor to verify their quality. There are testing services in the Netherlands and a few other places that do advanced analytical testing for free + take anonymous samples. Obviously the person selling product can not post the results themselves or they will just post fakes, but you could have a sub-forum for buyers who get product to post the test results if they choose to send in samples for testing themselves. Unfortunately, even the testing centers in Netherlands require you to actually ship the sample to be tested from Netherlands, and then there is the issue of &#039;we can&#039;t have a dude in the netherlands who gets drugs from a fuck load of people to send in for testing, or else he will end up getting busted&#039; again.

				$150 USD for a seller account is entirely reasonable.&nbsp; Auctioning seller accounts is a bad idea from everyone&#039;s standpoint.&nbsp; All the new seller accounts would be going to people dealing in hard drugs and higher quantities.&nbsp; This would completely cut out marijuana distributors.&nbsp; And eventually when the prices for seller accounts become low enough for marijuana sellers to enter the market, these type of sellers are going to be selling in quantity.&nbsp; People (such as myself) new to Silk Road don&#039;t want to buy in quantity.&nbsp; We just want a taste.&nbsp; We just want to get our feet wet.&nbsp; Newbies won&#039;t be comfortable dropping $110 on a quarter from some anonymous person.&nbsp; So from this standpoint, you are boxing out the buyers and sellers.<br /><br />It should be noted that there is a severe shortage of variety in marijuana that can be gotten from US based merchants.&nbsp; Especially for those who just want to buy a couple of grams.&nbsp; For this reason you should not limit yourselves to one new merchant per day.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying you have to open the floodgates, but I&#039;m suggesting something more measured.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was expecting this thread to on and on with peoples grievances with the proposed auction system.&nbsp; But Silk Road not only did you come in and address those concerns directly, you appealed to us to find a solution.&nbsp; That shows strong leadership and the people here place a high amount of value in being listened to.&nbsp; We all have high hopes and expectations for this marketplace and when we hear things like &quot;auction system&quot; and &quot;limit 1 per day&quot; our hopes are quickly dashed.&nbsp; When I first read about it, I thought, &quot;ok, the person(s) who operate this site think they&#039;ve reached it&#039;s potential and want to start milking this for what it&#039;s worth.&quot;&nbsp; Then I read about how some crazy guy made threats.&nbsp; To go to the extreme of having an auction system and a limit of 1 per day made me think you were just using this nutjobs email as an excuse to milk.&nbsp; Time will tell.&nbsp; <br /><br />$50 alone would be enough to deter scammers by my estimate.&nbsp; But for such an illegal operation, a 5% middleman cut doesn&#039;t quite do you justice.&nbsp; I have no problem paying $150 (If I ever decide to sell weed.&nbsp; No plans as of yet).&nbsp; This website deserves it and will improve it&#039;s integrity.

				So you claim someone told you they would post poisonous substances, ok so lets deal with this stupid justification. If a person wanted to do this we have to understand why. <br /><br />1. They&#039;re an anti-drug extremist<br />2. They&#039;re law enforcement trying to shut down open registration<br />3. They&#039;re just nuts<br /><br />In the first instance you won&#039;t stop an extremist by charging cash, they&#039;ll make enough money to do it anyway. Secondly law enforcement wouldn&#039;t send poisons but could always buy every account anyway to track customers, third the nuts person will also find the money to carry out such a plan. <br /><br />Basically your justification is a lame one, and i have no doubt it&#039;s made up.<br /><br />You also still have not figured out a way to protect SELLERS! Sellers take big risks being scammed for quality product. Maybe make buyers pay for accounts huh.

				It&#039;s definitely a PSYOP. If I were you I wouldn&#039;t have even mentioned it since that is exactly what they intended. Remember that bitcoin has the potential to be seriously disruptive to the power&#039;s that be and they will do what they can to fuck with it. Couple that with the power you have over the exchange rate (you saw the gawker spike - shit, silk road is probably the only real backing bitcoin has atm) and it&#039;s really not surprising that they&#039;re trying to discourage users.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think charging for accounts will help regardless of whether the threat is legitimate. Anyone who was actually determined to kill would not be dissuaded from that just because they get charged to do it. Law enforcement would also have no problem paying for an account. It will however deter genuine business from small sellers. The time it would take to start making a profit by selling my prescriptions just wouldn&#039;t be worth it imo. And I especially wouldn&#039;t want to pay knowing that such a terrible idea can&#039;t last.<br /><br />Whistler&#039;s idea is a stroke of genius though. I&#039;d have no problem paying a retainer to be used as collateral until I have a reputation that can speak for itself. As for monetizing the service you provide, just take a slice of each sale and call it a transaction fee.

				I was tracking down some btc today, and I saw it had dropped in value again,&nbsp; and I finally realized what a motherfucker that must be for sellers, and even when I dispute their reasoning,&nbsp; I listen.&nbsp; I think you should charge/auction memberships to all, buyers included.&nbsp; I could see charging xtra to be a seller, as that&#039;s where most of the scams seem to lie, but I don&#039;t like the idea that sellers are at the mercy of both the btc system, and an unscrupulous or naive buyer who immediately thinks the seller hasn&#039;t shipped when product doesn&#039;t arrive on time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Charging buyers to join would eliminate the bad ones, and maybe downgrading escrow to where it&#039;s limited when sellers have a certain amount of points, or eliminating escrow when both buyer and seller are in agreement that seller is known and trustworthy.&nbsp; I know my sellers, and if you had a place I could click, when making transaction, to eliminate escrow, I&#039;d click it.&nbsp; Leave it open and anonymous, like everything else, but this might relieve some of the strain on sellers lately...

				isiredsami - yeah except there is a glaringly huge difference between the state and SR.<br /><br />You are here 100% voluntarily.&nbsp; nobody is standing behind your computer chair with a gun at the back of your head, saying that you have to be on SR and SR forums or you&#039;re dead.&nbsp; SR is not your property - the owner of SR can change it however he wishes and you either stay or go, his changes will reflect his desire to keep people around doing transactions because that is the only way he makes money from SR.<br /><br />The government uses these excuses to do exactly what you say, except there is no voluntary aspect to it.&nbsp; You either do, or you get kidnapped and locked away, or hospitalized or murdered, or your property is stolen from you.&nbsp; This isnt&#039; legislation on SR this is somebody doing whatever he wants with his property, no force involved.&nbsp; I had a seller account before and he&#039;s not going back and retroactively charging people to use it now, it&#039;s a &quot;from here on out&quot; situation - which is completely fair.&nbsp; He could insist that every prospective seller send in a picture proving he has blue hair or eats dog food from a can if he wants.

				phubaiblues hit the nail on the head. buyer accounts should be bought for a small fee.....$50 a pop for a buyer account of something like that....maybe even the same price as a seller account....there goes multiple accounts out the window....buyers should also have a &#039;meter&#039; next to there username which indicates how many successful buys they have had and how many sour ones

				Most of us here--buyers and sellers--are grateful for what SR does, and realize his position is not easy either.&nbsp; But the reality is, something needed to be done to prevent fake seller scammers from easily joining and wreaking havoc among the buyers.&nbsp; He did that.&nbsp; All I&#039;m saying--as a buyer--is that there might be other ways of spreading the burden around.&nbsp; And perhaps a way of lessening the burden on sellers who have proved they are legit, by making it more difficult for fake *buyers* to join easily also.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t realized this was a problem until lately, and it seems it&#039;s in areas other than the ones I follow.&nbsp; But good sellers protect us buyers in many ways: in the packaging, in the labeling, in pm-ing us when packages are late, in posting gpg public keys so we don&#039;t freak about our addresses: all kinds of ways.<br /><br />I get defensive when buyers are attacked, or when sellers want private forums...but the best way to avoid those outcomes is by accepting that some of the seller complaints are legit, and supporting them in finding ways to make this a good safe place for all of us....we&#039;re in this together.&nbsp; It&#039;s a new venture, international, disliked by *all* governments, and hopefully a harbinger of a future where we won&#039;t need to operate in the shadows, where what we put in *our* bodies is *our* business.&nbsp; <br /><br />So it seems one of the biggest problems facing sellers is caused by abuse of escrow system, and I don&#039;t see why there couldn&#039;t be a way where after one transaction, where both parties are in agreement it went well, where buyers couldn&#039;t have a way to bypass proxy and let seller get paid.&nbsp; The sellers I deal with won&#039;t rip me, so if pkg goes missing, I don&#039;t feel they burnt me.&nbsp; This would let legit sellers and buyers just do business, and only new sellers and buyers would be &#039;under the escrow gun.&#039;&nbsp; <br /><br />And I *want* SR to make money.&nbsp; Damned straight.&nbsp; We can have dreams and hopes and political views all day long, but this is a business venture, and needs to be profitable.&nbsp; SR takes risks--provides service.<br /><br />On the other hand, tho, the auctioning/selling of seller accounts is a good idea, and needs to stay.&nbsp; Nitpicking at SR&#039;s posts to prove inconsistency of ideology isn&#039;t fair...we all jabber about all kinds of things on here.&nbsp; That was something needed to be done, and he did it.&nbsp; Well done.&nbsp; What we want to do now is continue improvements, and find ways to get rid of bad buyers, or at least make it more costly for them to join: that will get rid of the fly by nite scammers, and whatever fee, even retrocative so as not to be hypocrite, is fine with me.&nbsp; This site, so far, has survived quite a bit, and we need to help it along, when we can.

				@isiredsami - I feel like you&#039;re confusing what he didn&#039;t say with saying something false. True, SR didn&#039;t say he wanted to make more money. i think we all know he&#039;d like to make more money. Most people like making money. Why does he need to spell that out? But what is also true is that this policy was in response to an actual, not fictional, problem. The market was becoming flooded with bogus seller accounts, seeing if they could walk away with a few BTC before a pattern emerged of their scamming. Now that someone has to invest, they&#039;re more likely to actually be here for the long haul. That makes sense to me. Where&#039;s the fiction?<br /><br />I also wouldn&#039;t mind charging a small fee for buyer accounts, since buyers are capable of scamming too. Making people invest a small amount of money into a semi-private anonymous marketplace is a stabilizing force.

				Letting the market decide is fine, but why not have a screening process too? This isn&#039;t, strictly speaking, the free market; this is a privately owned marketplace that we participate in because the people who own it allow us to. They set the rules and we choose to participate. We choose to participate based on them making the overall quality of the site satisfactory for buyers and sellers. If we don&#039;t like it, there are plenty of other places on TOR to get your drugs from.. I agree we shouldn&#039;t be overburdened by rules and regulations, but I wouldn&#039;t call a small one time fee for entrance into a privately owned marketplace overburdening.

				Sr has the rep, because they&#039;ve set up an escrow system so buyers couldn&#039;t be ripped.&nbsp; Other sites don&#039;t do as well.&nbsp; And SR does seem to be aware of problems and requests, and changes if they seem wanted by all sides.&nbsp; I agree that large quantity sites are totally different, money is a bigger deal...but that&#039;s not the case here, and what we have works.&nbsp; I tried other sites, didn&#039;t like them, lost some money on one, so I came back here.&nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t pay the fee but I admit I respect and agree with it in terms of profit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sellers are here for a reason.&nbsp; You know the deal before going in, take it or leave it.<br /><br />Since people pay it , that to me shows its a &quot;far market value&quot; at least to enough where it&#039;s working charging.<br /><br />One solution to sellers who don&#039;t want fork over money to get started but are legit might be letting them work it off.&nbsp; It&#039;s alot easier to pay in product than cash for most.&nbsp; Why not let them work it off?&nbsp; Seller account is 160? The guy has to move 160 in retail volume through escrow, that will then go directly towards his sellers account.<br /><br />Sellers would have to actually have REAL transactions and feedback to get on board fully.&nbsp; Sure, he could fake a 300 dollar sale and do it in one transaction but that it would still make him pay for it.

				@marketmaker - In a scenario where a seller has to get x dollars in sales to become &quot;legitimate&quot;, if he were to buy the product from himself, he would not only have a &quot;legitimate&quot; seller account but a positive feedback score to boot, attracting some of the 28,000 or so members who are not registered on the forums, now that the waters have been tested.&nbsp; Same result as if he had just bought an account for the roughly $100 they are going for, but now he also has a feedback score.<br /><br />Scammers generally don&#039;t like putting a whole lot out there.&nbsp; Legit sellers are probably going to be more likely to do a solid bid for a seller account than a scammer who is just trying to skimp some BTC from the unsuspecting user-base.&nbsp; I think the way it is is great - still a lot of room for competition but also keeping away fly-by-nighters.&nbsp; SR&#039;s quality will increase as the seller-base grows, and prices should come down a bit on the buyer side.&nbsp; But this way we already have a ream of established sellers carrying basically every mind-altering product available, and new sellers have to be extra legitimate to pass over that benchmark.&nbsp; This forces not only quality of product up, but quality of overall service by sellers on SR, including shipping, which is a biggie.&nbsp; If someone has to compete with the best walking right in the door, this is good for the buyer.

				The cost of a seller account is purely market based - it&#039;s an auction, and is therefore fully driven by outside demand.&nbsp; The price is whatever the highest bid is. <br /><br />$140 for a seller account is not bad.&nbsp; I will have done almost 100 transactions by mid august.&nbsp; That is $1.40 per transaction, in less than 2 months.&nbsp; That is less than the SR market fee!

				I see this new seller account fee as being problematic not just for myself, but for the community in general.&nbsp; What I have seen in this thread have been cost analysis done on a most base level, to simply state that because you are nearing 100 transactions and the new seller account fee (which wasn&#039;t in place at your time) is 141 dollars, it essentially is $1.41 for each transaction!&nbsp; This is the cajolery I expect on late night infomercials not on open market forums.&nbsp; The second dubious element is the arbitrary valuation of the seller&#039;s account, sure there is an auction where we can bid a &#039;fair&#039; price but this auction block is directly underneath and is firmly entwined with the 11 btc price-tag in pretty bold print.&nbsp; I understand that scammers are bothersome and measures need be taken to eradicate them, but it seems in this process honest the small-quantity high-quality seller or seasonal sellers are left to face the monochrome readouts after inputting &#039;insignificant&#039; digits.<br /><br />I understand this is primarily to keep out unsavory resellers, but couldn&#039;t it also act to serve certain avaricious resellers monopolistic hopes?&nbsp; If they&#039;re able to buy up new accounts as they come to market, keep competition to a minimum, couldn&#039;t they make back what those accounts cost and more by controlling every items price?&nbsp; I know this is taking things to an extreme, but who&#039;s to say otherwise?&nbsp; Well I guess you need to pay to ride this train, and with all the swaying and clattering going on, I am weary of paying to ride the luxurious Orient Express in hopes of peddling my quality nonetheless scant wares...<br /><br />I would think a fee re-evaluation or a &quot;sample transaction&quot; means of verification would be as efficacious and cultivate a richer more diverse marketplace.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />peaches

				Really people, if you don&#039;t like the cost involved, then do what you have to do elsewhere.&nbsp; It&#039;s as simple as that.&nbsp; They are offering the option of either a one time fee or bidding on an auction.&nbsp; It all comes down to the question, would you rather spend $0 standing on a street corner amongst crack heads, heroin junkies, and narcs, or pay ~$100 and sit in some coffee shop anonymously with your latte, biscotti, and laptop amongst book worms and corporate execs?&nbsp; If it&#039;s worth it, which it seems to be to a number of members, then people will happily pay.&nbsp; And even if there is a charge, I would still think it to be a free open market.&nbsp; The word free does not necessarily mean without cost.

It sounds like you&#039;re just trying to make more money. Although on the other hand, you might find you get more by leaving things as they are and having people pay a set price for a seller account.<br /><br />And who says only the more dedicated and professional will get these positions? That&#039;s crap!<br /><br />goblin<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Goblin...This post is a year old..LOL<br /><br />You really need to pay a little more attention to what you are reading before you post!
