				I provide a service that is the safest fastest and most convenient way to use SR on your mobile. I stand by my service and would be happy to discuss how it works and compares to some other solutions for that as well as the ramifications of each or any. I also professionally develop Andriod and iOS apps.<br /><br />It makes people uneasy, but people want to do this, (get on SR from their mobile.) Tell yer kid he can&#039;t smoke weed and he&#039;ll just sneak around in shadier situations to make it happen, am I right? Let&#039;s discuss the trade-offs of different policies in different situations so more people have thought out more scenarios. I think that is how to protect the community.<br /><br />Am I going to tell you there are no risks to take into consideration? Certainly not. Security and convenience are inherently at odds with eachother. Security is obviously more important to most of us here. Sure we&#039;d all feel much safer if everyone only logged in from their mother-in-law&#039;s basement, browsed only with an OpenBSD+TRESOR system, and stood up to interrogation techniques like Jack Bauer. You guys can get mad when n00bs ask about their iThings but do you think that discourages them and thus you are safer? Maybe that one guy gives up on the idea out of fear thanks to your warning but you haven&#039;t really taught him anything and the curious and enamored are going to keep coming asking for it.<br /><br />Most of us have a suspicion and distrust of most large establishments. Apple is a popular target of paranoid contempt. Rightly so? Sure. But what about Microsoft? Symantec? Trend Micro? The list is practically endless All of them are in positions to violate so many n00bs and therefore us. The reason SR is great is that the model holds up well in the case of partial breach. Of course this place is already crawling with LE. We must remain cognizant and diligent. There are digital networking risks and physical risks to using a portable unencrypted device with a proprietary operating system.<br /><br />Your iPhone is tracking your location. That is all. Apple does not send anything about your browsing activity off device except of course the traffic itself. AT&amp;T cannot eavesdrop on anything you send to a secure site. The government and plenty of others in positions to abuse power could, if they set up an authorized man-in-the middle attack. They have to be on to you and set that up in advance and not just call AT&amp;T after-the-fact. That is because of the flawed SSL CA model and you can alleviate that by checking certificate fingerprints manually against a copy you received from a side-channel.<br /><br />Tor does not rely on SSL at all. There are no CA&#039;s to betray your trust but that is the simple reason for the gobbeldygook.onion names. (it IS the fingerprint.) You can never set your tor hidden site up at a human-memorable name of your choosing. Tor is slow enough on Verizon FiOS how do you think it performs over 3G or GPRS? Like garbage, that&#039;s how. My service handles the tor while what you are doing is connecting to a server of mine via SSL. It is not technically much different from gateways like web2tor except it&#039;s not free and bogged down and you are connecting to a random legitimate business&#039;s highly secure server and slipping in with gobs of legitimate traffic. Both web2tor and tor installed on your phone will still allow your network operators to see you are on the tor, even if they can&#039;t see what you&#039;re up to. With my service they will even be totally unaware that you are even using tor.<br /><br />If you do use any gateway such as mine to get on SR, you are trusting the operator because he could evesdrop or even withdraw your BTC. I will not. Can you trust me? I assure you. Do I expect you to? Not really. I made it for myself in an afternoon, if it helps anyone else out, great! I&#039;d be happy to give anyone the source to run it themselves for free if they have the inclination. It&#039;s not hard and it runs on any OS supported by tor and apache. it&#039;s not a new actual program its all in the configuration of apache and tor/polipo

If you must use your cell phone then root it and install Orweb as your browser, which is made to run through Orbot. <br /><br />I&#039;d stick with the Tor bundle on your PC, or better yet, create a Tails USB drive.&nbsp;

				(rubs eyes and blinks) Did I just see a picture of Murray Rothbard????<br /><br />The list of evil OS developers collecting everything they can forgot to mention Google, the maker of Android.<br /><br />Anyway, I run Orbot rooted so it &quot;transparently&quot; proxys everything. You dont need Proxymob that way.<br />I use Firefox but it should proxy the stock browser too. At least that&#039;s what I&#039;m told.<br />I still would never connect using the cell network. Only a wireless router.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have as much tech knowledge as has been displayed here already.....but I&#039;m always learning.<br />So I ask those who know....is my setup &quot;safe&quot;?<br />Is it actually doable to to root Orbot over 3G without instantly giving up your ID?<br />Even with a wifi do I need to shut off virtually everything else the phone is running for fear of a leak or is transparent proxying covering me? Like using a special profile set up or a custom ROM, which I haven&#039;t tried yet. Just stock with root access.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Is that safer?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hahaha none of it&#039;s safe, right? :) Arguably, by some marginal amount, perhaps safer. How/where tor+ploipo are set up is much more important than wifi+cable vs 3G. There are so many other factors and the network itself is not a very important one. Every single network can be assumed to be under LE control.<br /><br />There&#039;s no right way to use these devices. There&#039;s always a tradeoff and unknowns. In theory, I&#039;d feel safer with all the software configured and working on the jailbroken iPad, but securing a jailbroken iPad is a whole &#039;nother ball of wax for another message board entirely. If you&#039;re on your home network and want to keep your iPad stock, you can run tor/polipo on your PC/Mac and direct your iPad through that. However, your wireless is then the weak link there because polipo and the browser, they talk unencrypted. Your wireless net better be locked down damn good. Don&#039;t forget you gave your neighbor the password too. Does he watch your traffic now? Even without the password, WPA2-P is magnitudes weaker than TLS (modern SSL) or each individual layer of the onion&#039;s encryption. (in my opinion anyway) but it&#039;s seldom just a case of stronger vs weaker. &quot;Attack vectors&quot; can be different. ie. TLS is strong and saddled with a broken trust model in every shipping OS/browser but that&#039;s an example of &quot;the man&quot; socially engineering our security out of us.<br /><br />This place isn&#039;t a success because people can get away with it, it&#039;s enough that most believe they can. We aren&#039;t still free because we&#039;re security experts. We&#039;re small fish with the benefit of dumb luck, for the most part. Are you just a lowly pothead hoping that officer Barbrady doesn&#039;t stumble upon your doings, or you&#039;re an established drug kingpin trying to evade the supercop who&#039;s currently gunnin&#039; for you with a major hard-on and already hot on your trail? Most of us are a lot closer to the former I think. If it&#039;s the latter, you need to hire experts not ask the peanut gallery. I&#039;m sure that expert would say you&#039;d better stay the hell off of them fancy new mobile devices. They are toys, after all.<br /><br />There&#039;s a million factors here. When people slip up it&#039;s usually not because the FBI hacked their 256-bit n00b-crypt, and darn I shoulda went with l33t-crypt 2048 and only browsed from inside a lead box. Information &quot;leakage&quot; is more likely how they&#039;ll get ya and it will betray you through your encryption and your nuclear bunker. Browsers volunteer so much information about you and your computer in the name of convenience and nifty features. Nifty and convenient is pretty much the driving force of the mobile gadget market. Polipo does what it can but you&#039;d have to analyze and tweak everything to be sure. Any applications you use simultaneously while browsing via tor increase your risk of leakage as well as improve the effectiveness of traffic analysis techniques and that goes for PCs or phones.<br /><br />It&#039;s all give and take. Be careful pay attention learn and do the best you can. You can&#039;t live your life in paranoia though, if you can&#039;t accept risk this is the wrong place to be. Anyone who thinks they are &quot;safe&quot; because they did this and this and this is probably just deluding themselves out of a paranoid denial of risk rather than a healthy avoidance of. Or, if they are safe, that and that and that was actually a well thought out and very particular plan for them which may or more likely may not apply to anyone else.<br /><br />Be careful who and what you believe. All success can be attributed equally to pure genius or dumb luck
