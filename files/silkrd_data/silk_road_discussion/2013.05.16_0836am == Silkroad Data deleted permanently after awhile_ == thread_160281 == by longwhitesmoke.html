				IIRC, that is said to be after three or four month.<br />in case you need to use the resolution center, the admins can still see the deleted messages in this time frame, after which it should be completely wiped.

				Was worried for a second when I misread the title as &quot;Silkroad deleted permanently after awhile&quot; <br />Agree on the 90 days rule. I think vendor feedback is also the same.

				It appears that old accounts are (or were) deleted after some time. I believe I signed up for my first account in early 2012. I looked around but the selection of items for sale wasn&#039;t nearly as extensive as it is now and the prices were outrageously higher than what I could get locally, so I didn&#039;t end up purchasing anything. I tried to log in again this year and wasn&#039;t able to. This was before the current &quot;silkroad&quot; onion address, and back before the address was listed all over the web. I&#039;m not really sure what happened but it certainly appears that they thin out old accounts.

				I have an old account that I hadn&#039;t logged into in 6 or 7 months. I was recently able to log into it, because it still had like .0001 BTC in it, because the interface used to only show two decimal places, so I couldn&#039;t withdraw everything. One interesting thing is that there was no BTC address associated with it. It looked like a new account that says &quot;click here to make a deposit&quot; instead of showing an address.<br /><br />So I think all data associated with the account really is deleted after the time periods listed. <br /><br />As for being &quot;archived&quot;, I wonder what that means, since the account gets archived after all data is deleted. It may just be to preserve the name so someone else doesn&#039;t create an account to impersonate an old account.

				I&#039;ve seen a vendor with 83 complete orders who has been inactive for 1yr+ and has posted new listings, and they have 0 feedback comments on their page. Does feedback become deleted for vendors who have been inactive for a given time?
