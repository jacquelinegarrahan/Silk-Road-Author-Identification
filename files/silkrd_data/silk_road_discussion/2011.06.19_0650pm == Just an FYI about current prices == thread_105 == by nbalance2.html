				Prices on SR right now are inflated because MTGOX was either hacked or someone sold a ton of coins, so BTC were trading at all the way down in the cents/few dollars per coin range--so that&#039;s why an 1/8th of weed right now is priced over $100.

				It said on the mtgox support page that they will be resetting the price back to $17.5 at around 1am tonight.<br /><br />I think its a bad idea for SilkRoad to continue using mtgox for its price conversions since they have proven to be untrustworthy with security.<br />

It looks like a wealthy MTGOX account was hacked and the hacker sold thousands of coins for $0.01. They&#039;re rolling back all the transactions to just before this occurred and everything should be back to normal in the next 12 hours. So after MTGOX fixes everything and SR syncs its exchange rate with them, the prices should be back to normal.

				If you&#039;d be really good you&#039;d write a page that takes in all BTC Exchanges and BTC-OTC, that would give you a halfway decent picture of what&#039;s going on. Also Bitcoincharts does fumble too, as they said bitmarketEU was lower than mtgox which is not true with current exchange rates. But that&#039;s just my take.

				I&#039;m confused.<br /><br />SR&#039;s prices are currently set at an exchange rate of 1BTC=$17.50USD.<br /><br />Are vendor&#039;s accepting this rate? With MtGox still down, it seems unusual for SR to establish an accurate exchange rate.<br /><br />Am I missing something?

				We are trying to stay on top of things but give us a couple of days. We did end up canceling some orders that were made witht eh invalid pricing. We do follow though on sales, even at our own great loss (as shown by Black Friday) but we consider orders when the system is down as exploits and do not feel obligated to honor them. Ordering 20 1/8th&nbsp; for $5 each is not going to work. <br /><br />More information on our user page and FAQ<br />GreenCo<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1647

				I don&#039;t understand how this could have negatively affected you, if the all the price did was skyrocket down... either you have your listings pegged to the value of a bitcoin, in which case your prices would be extremely high and no buyer in their right mind would buy, or you have it set to a flat bitcoin value, in which case you still get the same number of bitcoins, and they should be the same value (assuming the market recovers) when you cash them out.<br /><br />Or do you mean you are holding off on filling orders right now until you see how the market reacts to this (I wouldn&#039;t blame you if you did)?&nbsp; I&#039;m confused.

				Yeah, I don&#039;t really give a shit about the value of the Bitcoin, since the cost in Bitcoins is scaled to the USD list price. The day-traders can panic about it being devalued, I just use it as an intermediary to USD. What are we, FOREX traders? No.

				GreenCo are not speculators. They do everything in dollars and switch out. During the weekend Bitcoin went to zero and now it is at like 13-14 on trade hill. Silk Road auto-adjuster is still down. <br /><br />Silk Road has been down 4 times in the last 10 days and for more than 50% total downtime. GreenCo lost tons and tons of money in escrow and shipping delays. People bought 1/8ths for 1 and 2 btc that are now worth like $15-20 and still stuck in escrow <br />GreenCo members have been on Silk Road since the first week, but this was pretty hard on them.<br /><br />There are plenty of people who see bitcoin as an investment. It is probably a good one, but GreenCo has to pay people, buy food, pay for their kids&#039; college. It&#039;s a business to them. <br />

				@techlord it certainly does. However Buyers chose when to make the deal, Sellers have to wait 5-10 days to get money out of escrow and have less choice about starting conditions. That is a much harder prediction. Even if you are a bitcoin investor and think value will generally go up crashes are steeper, more dramatic, and less predictable then climbs. (I am talking historically and not just for bitcoin but stock market, gold, tulips or anything).<br /><br />Risk is fine if you are using small amounts of money to buy something you want.

				Quote hasn&#039;t been working for me so I&#039;ll just copy paste:<br /><br />&quot;Would &quot;respectable&quot; sellers offer partial refunds or credits to buyers that overpaid because the market went bull? Yeah, I didn&#039;t think so.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s a good point. I&#039;ve overpaid for bitcoins, then had to buy MORE bitcoins because the price had changed while I was waiting for funds to transfer. but that is not the seller&#039;s fault so I just deal. Everyone takes losses at times, it&#039;s just the way the market is. just like if you buy into the stock market. I would never intentionally try to screw over a seller, just as I wouldn&#039;t want to be screwed over.

				If the value of BTC dropped in half in the period from when the order was placed to when the payment was taken out of escrow then the seller is out a fucketload of cash.&nbsp; You&#039;re right, buyers would not care, but if it meant losing a reliable source then I know I would be concerned with the situation.&nbsp; We can&#039;t all be bastards all the time. Going the other way, sellers could be generous with their measuring if the BTC price doubled after the order was placed.&nbsp; And their is plenty of evidence around that we have sellers who are top notch.

				Just to be clear, it&#039;s not the volatility that concerned me, it was the discrepancy between SR&#039;s exchange rate and the popular market exchange rate, which at the time was nearly 40%!&nbsp; <br /><br />SR has fixed this issue (Thank You!) so I am no longer worried.

				Sorry for the confusing and offputting $100.<br />Our 1/8oz (3.5g) price is $50-60 usd depending on strain and what not.<br />Any other price is due to some other glitch, downtime, delay in the auto adjuster, or some other contributing factor outside of our direct control. We try to manually get around glitches when we can. Prices are weird now because MtGox and the Silk Road auto adjuster are both down.
