				Hi all, I&#039;ll make this as brief as possible. <br /><br />I contacted a veteran vendor (don&#039;t want to name names) on SR to have $500USD converted to BTC last week. After the vendor&#039;s 10% cut and deposit fee, it ended up being $444. A few hours later, I had 84.57 BTC in my account. <br /><br />Later that day, I bought an item which was $210USD exactly. <br /><br />Here&#039;s what&#039;s confusing me...If I had $444 sent to my SR account, I should have been able to buy 2 of the item I mentioned, right? That would be $440. Well, after buying the 1 item last week, I was left with 41.18 BTC ($192) in my account. What happened to that remaining $50 bucks? I just don&#039;t get it, how did $444 turn into $402???<br /><br />Thanks in advance everyone!<br /><br />After a little research, here&#039;s what I&#039;ve found. My vendor based our transaction on the BTC rate being 5.10. I checked and the BTC market high for the past 7 days was 4.78 with the average being 4.68.&nbsp; (Our transaction was less than 7 days ago)<br /><br />Does this mean my vendor took advantage of me?

				Very likely a shift in the value of bitcoins while you were ordering.&nbsp; Its quite a volatile currency.<br /><br />SR prices are set in USD and the prices in bitcoin tracks the value on the exchanges.&nbsp; When the value moves about so do all the bitcoin prices.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t like holding onto Bitcoins for very long at all,&nbsp; for this very reason.&nbsp; The 2-3 hour window to move them onto the SR bothers me and I always have to buy a few more just in case the values shift while I am waiting.<br />

				Does everyone put up with this? My balance has remained at 41.18 sine I made my purchase, so maybe &quot;vanishing&quot; wasn&#039;t the correct word to use. But I just don&#039;t find it acceptable that $40 is literally nowhere to be found.

				that is why you shouldn&#039;t buy your bitcoins until you are ready to purchase something. there is just way too much fluctuation in the market. <br />

				I did account for hedging and I bought my item within MINUTES of the Bitcoins hitting my account. <br /><br />After conversing with the vendor, they discovered an error on their part. They just sent me the difference. <br /><br />Thanks for the info everyone, problem solved!

				Dood, ฿84.57 - ฿-43.39 = ฿41.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There is a fee added to each purchase when you order.<br /><br />~Digi
