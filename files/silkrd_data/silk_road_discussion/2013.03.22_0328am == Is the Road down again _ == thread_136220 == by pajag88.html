				Yes. Again.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry DPR, but what&#039;s going on here?<br />&nbsp;<br />We know there&#039;s no shortage of money coming the Roads way, so why isn&#039;t there a more stable infrastructure for the site? If it&#039;s closing due to security updates, let us know- keep us posted. A lot of people have A LOT of money just floating around, and because&nbsp; this is virtually an unregulated marketplace I feel like there needs to be more communication. I also believe that there&#039;s either a lack of motivation, or a breakdown somewhere down the line and someone&#039;s negligence has lead to this colossal traffic jam. My paranoia is telling me that SR has made enough money, and has started to let the Road slowly kill itself in order to avoid any legal ramifications. <br /><br />I guess that just leaves room for BMR and sites alike to step in and fill the void. Even though those sites would have to dramatically change some major security flaws before I would even think about using them.<br /><br />Just a small voice from one of those peons making you millions-

				BMR actually gets a really bad wrap here on SR for obvious reasons. <br /><br />They have become more legit than in the past, but still would rather not rely on them.<br /><br />There are plenty of vendors that operate both on BMR and Silk Road. Like i said though, BMR is not near as reputable. However, it works and the site is accessible and prompt.

				Lots of new people! I got on this morning and had messages from about 5-8 NEW customers, so new, they are asking what a bitcoin is and why they couldn&#039;t just mail me cash! I send them to the forum and give a little info, but this slowness is most likely being caused by the hoards of new people coming on! More customers for me!<br /><br />BMR is a great backup I sell on both sites and in times like these it helps me keep calm seeing all the sales coming in on there because people can&#039;t get it on here! BMR is becoming much more legit and there is even a new beta feature for exchanging BTC for the currency of your choice!

But on the downside, there are a number of scammers, just don&#039;t FE ever and you should be fine! Also, there is no auto finalize, so be sure to release escrow when you get your order!<br /><br />I might make some admin mad, but I know all you buyers that are freaking out will love me for this, so here you go! http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/

				Sr will be back online soon. Back in Nov is was down for a week, and that felt like an eternity.&nbsp; `that was due to an influx of newbies joining.&nbsp; A lot of my friends have been reading and learning about BTC and i&#039;m sure the word of the road is spreading like a wild fire! If there&#039;s anything i&#039;ve learned from the road is to be patient. <br /><br />Official update from DPR himself : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=136275.msg926501#msg926501

I would and that is how I feel about this, I am still coming back to SR, but I need a place that is accessible to do what I need to do right now. And it would relieve some system stress if we didn&#039;t have 10 million new members showing up at once! It&#039;s like we are all pushing and shoving to get through this little door while there is another wide open door right next to it!

				I understand what your saying but i dont agree with your analogy this is a silk road forum so by posting that here you are kind of taking customers away from silk road im just not so sure thats something you should be doing on the silk road forum... however that is only my opinion and you are free to do as you wish i mean no offense.

If people spent more time searching the dark web and not just using tor for SR and SR only, they would be able to make their own choice. People on here are all about the freedom of choice right? so now each person can make their own decision! And also, BMR works in some markets that SR refuses to touch and will scare off some of the less criminally inclined people, ie. stolen private info, weapons, poisons, and more, there is nothing not aloud there except contract kills and that used to be ok! so maybe you still shop SR for your drugs, but go to BMR to buy a gun or paypal passwords or stolen credit card info. <br /><br />I had to start there because I didn&#039;t have the funds to buy a SR seller account at first. During an extended outage I got a bunch of SR refugees as we called them and then I was able to buy in here. So I have some love for the place that got me started, but the business there is painfully slow and I make all my money here.... When I can get on that is!

				Back on line too, but sometimes seems it doesn&#039;t want to work for me.<br />Why does SR have to be advertised on TV.? <br />I found my way here threw Youtube, I dont watch TV, I live on the net anyway.

				Down again, enough time to write a response to a message, but not enough time to send it!<br /><br />I think this should get out of the media all together, I learned about it by working on a weed farm and talking with people. Then I did months of homework before joining the site, I don&#039;t understand all these people that think they can just send money to my paypal or bank account, don&#039;t they know this shit is illegal? There is no such thing as stupid questions... just stupid people!
