				Last night I packaged up a bunch of orders to send out today, and now with the problems again with SR, I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s even safe to ship these out yet? If something were to happen, and SR doesn&#039;t come back up, I&#039;d be out a lot of money. What are some of you other vendors doing? It sucks because I have a few customers that have been waiting since last Wednesday, but I just can&#039;t afford to be giving shit away!

				I&#039;m shipping orders out. It&#039;s a good faith effort toward my customers.<br /><br />My problem is that I can&#039;t log, not last night, not this morning. I know there are orders waiting and it&#039;s immensely frustrating. I want to take care of my people. I hope customers know that us vendors are really, really trying! Like for two hours now, I&#039;ve been hitting that &quot;Try Again&quot; button.

				I&#039;m sending mine out. Hopefully SR comes back up so I can receive the coins for it, but either way, the consumers will receive at least.

				It&#039;s a difficult situation. if it were me I would wait another couple of days and if it&#039;s all over then at least send them half their order and split the loss because just like you they were innocent victims and actually did their part too. BTW, I transferred 150 BTC into my SR wallet while the power was out, it sat in the address until yesterday when it was sent off to some unknown BTC address, however when I sent a miniscule payment today just to even see if my wallet&#039;s working and that showed up. SR support contacted me bizarrely asking for the SWR address I deposited the money into when I had given that to them in the first email with the blockchain info, it is still the same address as my account. I replied to them in 9 minutes, four hours later I heard nothing back before it went down again. I think it&#039;s fairly safe to assume I&#039;ve been ripped off by the one site I trusted more than anyone, being a Libertarian and knowing DPR claims to be this also, but greed poisons men&#039;s souls, let&#039;s hope it hasn&#039;t been taken over by hackers who don&#039;t care about anyone or anything but themselves!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72666.msg593932#msg593932">Quote from: Thirty_Rox on November 15, 2012, 04:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Last night I packaged up a bunch of orders to send out today, and now with the problems again with SR, I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s even safe to ship these out yet?

				Due to the inconsistency and&nbsp; complete doubt instilled within me over the past week for Silk Road, I will not be sending orders to new customers until the site returns to normal.<br /><br />I&#039;m already risking the BTC in my Silk Road wallet.&nbsp; In addition to that, I&#039;ve lost multiple sales and customers due to the outage.&nbsp; I won&#039;t be losing any more product until everything is figured out.<br /><br />There should be an explanation given as to what has happened.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t need to have specific detail; but at least information given to the customer base here would be nice.<br /><br />The site has been great while it lasted; but with all the media attention it has gotten, I feel like it is becoming a target.&nbsp; Something is quite suspicious when the administrator, DPR, has stated that the site has returned to normal and then, less than 12 hours later; the website is down once again.<br /><br />Something feels wrong.&nbsp; There have been many times in my life where I wish I had listened to my intuition.&nbsp; I think if no explanation is given for what is really happening, I will be moving to a site with less publicity and less malicious attackers.

				I am shipping all orders I received before 3am eastern today (11/15). I am still waiting to get paid from 2/3rd&#039;s of last week&#039;s orders too so the risk really adds up.<br /><br />When the Road does come back up I may have to remove all my listings until the system has proven itself again. If any of my buyers do get a chance to log in please do me the favor of finalizing early. I would never ask this of you if the escrow system was stable.

				I shipped all orders that I got &quot;confirmed&quot; before and during the &quot;blackout&quot;, it&#039;s easier to replace product than customers.

				I guess I&#039;ll ship. It just feels like the right thing to do, after all the customer actually laid out the coins, he&#039;s done the&quot;paying&quot;, so how can I deny the product? My reputation is important to me, and I like doing the right thing.<br /><br />goblin

				i&#039;m not shipping anything out. With the last outage I had 8k in escrow. The site came back on and customers finalized but it didn&#039;t matter cause I received half of the 8k in payments in hours of the site going up and withdrew and my withdraws aren&#039;t on the block chain. So this time I won&#039;t ship the 8k in sales I made yesterday. I&#039;m out about 16k still no money. I&#039;m not gonna send out another 8k in escrow if&nbsp; I have gotten paid from when it first went out. Sorry to my customers but that&#039;s 8k lost because of sr. Until they make it right than I will ship
