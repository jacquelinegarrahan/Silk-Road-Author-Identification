				Successful ZipZap payment yesterday late afternoon, checked status after 5 hours - &quot;Order execution failed!&quot;, multiple unanswered emails later, Rachel writes back to say the problem was forwarded to their tech support people, early afternoon today and just had my 6th confirmation. I&#039;ll call it a glitch because every previous time it was super fast - I go straight to my SR address.

				There was no info given that compromised anyone&#039;s security so I have no clue what you&#039;re talking about. And if the tech&#039;s name is fake then all the better. Bitinstant is a legal entity so what&#039;s the problem?

				I hope I&#039;m not jinxing myself here, but I&#039;ve never had a problem with BitInstant/ZipZap or anything. I&#039;ve done BitInstant to BTC addy, to Email, to BitStamp, and to Mt.Gox and the longest I&#039;ve ever had to wait was about 5 minutes before posting.&nbsp; I try to send smaller amounts($200 or less) at a time though. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s why but mine always post quick. I hear about so many issues, just glad I haven&#039;t had them yet. I don&#039;t know how large these transactions that have problems are, nor do I care as it&#039;s none of my biz, but possibly that has to do with any issues.&nbsp; Yesterday I did a transaction and it was complete to BTC address within minutes.

				Well this was the first time I&#039;ve experienced issues with BI. I was being a bit impatient, but that&#039;s because I really needed to purchase something with express mail ASAP. I feel like they would have eventually sent the BTC anyway at a later time had I not contacted them first.

				I&#039;ve never had to deal with that so I don&#039;t really know how I&#039;d react, probably not good though. I imagine it&#039;ll happen to me sooner or later but I hope not. I&#039;m gonna keep monitoring posts about these situations though so if it does I have an idea of what to do and what to expect. Thanks for sharing something we can all learn from.

				That&#039;s good to hear. I &#039;ve been a buyer on SR for over a year but until a month or so ago I used a different method to get BTC. I had no funds on hand one day so I had to use BitInstant and have been ever since. They seem really good but I just would hate to be missing cash and be clueless as to a course of action so I always check out these threads.

				As of recently, about the last month, bitinstant has been doing this very often. The bitcoin is getting more and more popular and so is there service. This is what I assume is causing the problems I have now had 2000$ disappear on several occasions. Don&#039;t worry they will work it, though it might take time.

				After a few emails BI got back to me and sent my order to their tech support people who pushed it through. All in all it took just under 24 hours to get my coin. Again, this was a first for me with BI - usually they&#039;re really quick - so I&#039;m gonna chalk it up to a glitch.

				LOL. I called once a while ago then realized that using a fake name, etc. when placing an order but calling with my cell phone (oops - caller ID) wouldn&#039;t help my anonymity! So i preferred to do the tormail thing and wait. Next time I&#039;ll probably just restrict my # and call. It probably would have been a lot faster that way.

				I haven&#039;t been having any problems using Bitinstant lately. I set up a free wallet at www.blockchain.info and from within the wallet I click &quot;Cash Deposit.&quot; This option uses Bitinstant to complete the order. Every time I do this the coins are in my blockchain wallet in 20mins. There is an Anonymizer option for 1.5% fee which draws all your coins from a general pool. I just bought 48BTC last week with this method. And what is also nice, once you click to send your coin to your SR wallet, at www.blockchain.com you can follow all the Confirmations. SR takes up to 2 hours for your coin to show up, but you can at least watch the confirmations adding up.<br /><br />Edit: When I just looked at this method it shows me this error<br />&quot;ZipZap deposits temporarily disabled, please email support &quot;

Once, my order wasn&#039;t going through because I used two different names... one on the BI website, one with MoneyGram. They realized this and still process it. I&#039;m sure they enforce it, but not for each and every transaction.
