				I&#039;ve been noticing a trend in some buyers.&nbsp; They&#039;re leaving feedback without trying the product!&nbsp; Guys, it&#039;s great you leave feedback about how the seller shipped the product, but we&#039;re also interested in how good their shit is!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				also remember that 4/5 is like 80%, which sucks<br />GreenCo has over a dozen pages of feedback and a total of three 4/5 - but they are totally unhelpful on improving the service<br />1 is blank, &quot;leave feedback here&quot;<br />another is &quot;not the sellers fault. 5 stars on the product quality and packaging.&quot; -what the hell? why mark down then?<br />the third is something like &quot;got mangled by postal machine, stayed together and was delivered ok&quot; The last one I think they should get a 6/5 not a 4<br /><br />Remember people the % rating drops a ton even with one 4/5. If someone deserves it tell them why.<br /><br />No need to rush, try the product, contact the seller if you have any issues at all. I know GreenCo will do whatever it takes to get that 5/5

				I&#039;m more concerned I won&#039;t get any feedbacks at all... as a honest seller I think I&#039;m in a disadvantage (people will tend to leave feedback more when int&#039;s negative and it will be skewed against me).

				The problem is that you are holding up money in escrow. If for whatever reason you aren&#039;t at liberty to try it for a couple days, then I feel bad holding onto the money longer.<br /><br />There&#039;s also trying to review it objectively which is sometimes hard. Maybe I didn&#039;t enjoy the product that much, but was it cause I drank 10 beers before partaking? Or maybe I didn&#039;t enjoy the effect due to personal preference and someone else will love it.. Or maybe it&#039;s just differences in how people&#039;s bodies process it.. do I give it a mediocre rating when the seller did everything else perfectly?

				To me, the feedback on the seller&#039;s page is to determine shipping speed/quality, packaging quality, discreetness, responsiveness, legitimacy, etc... not to gauge product quality.&nbsp; The forums are here for that.&nbsp; Besides, many products (like pharmacy pills) don&#039;t have a &#039;quality&#039; scale - either they&#039;re what the seller advertised or they aren&#039;t.&nbsp; So a 4/5 for that vendor might be on a different scale than a 4/5 for a coke vendor, if the buyer factored the quality of the coke into his rating.<br /><br />Perhaps there should be a second rating for &#039;product quality&#039;, for those products where it matters, but for right now I think the forums are the best place for this, as it allows more details to be given (which is important for such a subjective thing as &#039;quality&#039;).

				Product quality should be as described. Some people want &quot;marijuana mids&quot; and it&#039;s cool that funky has and advertises it. Like buying a used car I guess, if it&#039;s like they seller said it would be you can&#039;t ask for more. You could review &quot;low quality pot -as described 5/5&quot;. <br /><br />Descriptive reviews are more helpful to buyer and seller than just the number. That said, I am going to strangle the next person who gives GreenCo a 4/5 and writes &quot;perfect&quot;

				You can release the funds upon receiving the product and leave feedback later.&nbsp; You do not have to leave feedback at the time of releasing the funds.&nbsp; I release the funds on receipt of the product (i only purchase chron so i know if it is what is, not like L or molly).&nbsp; Once i have toked a bowl or two i come back and leave the feedback and give a description of EVERYTHING.&nbsp; &nbsp;After my short review on the vendors page i seek out if they have a thread and will post a review there.&nbsp;

				Thanks for throwing that out there Anarcho, i make sure to give specifics on the package for that reason.&nbsp; If i have an issue with packaging i try to message the vendor and give them possible suggestions, i feel if i am receiving the package they are at least doing something right packing it as it is though hah.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				1) Don&#039;t be a dick. <br />If you had a significant problem with the transaction, then message the seller and try to work things out. Being a dick on feedback just because your face didn&#039;t turn numb doesn&#039;t help other buyers. Or worse, if something wasn&#039;t the seller&#039;s fault (like postal strike, etc) don&#039;t knock THEM a point).<br /><br />2) Don&#039;t talk about packaging. <br />Was it &quot;good&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;? That&#039;s all the details necessary. If you want the seller to improve how he/she does it, then PM them. <br /><br />3) Remember it&#039;s all relative.<br />I don&#039;t personally pay attention to product ratings. I had one guy leave feedback for my seller that said the stuff was shit, and not worth the money. Yet another said it was worth every penny. It&#039;s all personal taste, literally. And personal preference. Was it the best I have ever had? No, but the timeliness, shipment, smoothness of communication, and privacy of transaction made up for other things. I agree, that the forum should be used if someone out there is selling shit product.<br />

				happytree&#039;s right.&nbsp; Don&#039;t abuse of feedback system.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve problems, sort them out with pm&#039;s.&nbsp; Generally feedback should be 100 per cent, and come here to forums to bitch about quality and such.&nbsp; I don&#039;t pay much attention unless it&#039;s stone negative.&nbsp; And the comments show why: no shows, or weeks jacking around, and lying in pms, then they deserve negative feedback.&nbsp; I generally keep it to: showed up on time, good vendor, or, lately: &quot;finalized early, trusted shipper&quot; and that&#039;s enough for anybody to know this shipper is good.
