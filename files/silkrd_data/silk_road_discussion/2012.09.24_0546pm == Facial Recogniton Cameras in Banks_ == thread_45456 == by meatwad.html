				Has anyone thought about this?&nbsp; Does anyone know if banks use facial recognition cameras?&nbsp; If they do, then that would certainly throw a lot of the anonymity out the window. What do you guys think?

				Yep, that me, Steven Johnson.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; &nbsp; No but seriously, especially BOA and Wells Fargo, do they use facial recognition cameras at their locations?

				its not illegal to go to the bank...<br /><br />its more likely you would be figured out by purchasing the coins, say on mt gox which cant be accessed by tor.<br /><br />so you should be breaking the link from purchasing to sending to SR. even then once they reach SR they are tumbled again. <br /><br />so if they figured out you bought btc at the bank thats all they would know... and its perfectly legal to buy btc

				Back in real life in non simulated environments, image recog is complete crap.<br /><br />It is good for standard, fixed situations without too many variables. e..g where everybody is forced to put their faces straight into a camera, or snapping car license plates. But it&#039;s easy to gull. Just search my posts using the right keywords, I&#039;ve posted on this subject at least ten times on how to defeat it.<br /><br />tldr; face location technology is great, facial comparisons are completely pants and defeated by the most elementary measures, false negatives and positives all over the place.<br /><br />In fact, the majority of biometric technologies are just fucking digital scarecrows to bully frightened peasants into toeing the line. Harsh, but that&#039;s basically what it is.

				great point, pine... as always :) posted a nude pic of you on the image thread, hope you dont mind <br /><br />interestingly if you want to mess up the facial recognition software all you have to do is smile the entire time.<br /><br />now a state like NJ or something has banned smiling for your drivers license because it fucks with their facial recog software lol

				Banks don&#039;t use facial recognition. Period. There is no regulatory requirement to do so and if there isn&#039;t some statutory or regulatory requirement, they wont spend the money. That isn&#039;t to say that if LE subpoenaed the &quot;tapes&quot; that they couldn&#039;t run them through facial recognition, but they won&#039;t, and that&#039;s not how you&#039;re likely to get caught.<br /><br />I&#039;d worry more about a suspicious activity report being filed than my face being caught on camera. Wink, sneeze funny and piss off a bank teller and you could have a SAR filed. There are no dollar minimums. However, practically speaking, 99% of bank employees are lazy shits and you&#039;d have to have an obvious pattern of shady money movement to garner this sort of bad attention.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_activity_report

				Hmmm. I saw a live demo of satellite facial recog a few years back. I&#039;ve no doubt the system was on its best behavior and tuned to give the best possible response, but it was impressive to say the least.<br /><br />Hell, even playing what facebook initially came up got my friend the phone number of an anonymous girl in a nightclub photo.<br /><br />This stuff is its infancy. Your bank may or may not have it or something like it. I would question its usefulness in a bank, unless it was tied into a records check for live risk assessment or some such, but even then, pretty overkill. What would the benefit be? Over here, you&#039;d be required to tell your customers somewhere in some unlocatable small print. <br /><br />But, as always, if someone can create a system, someone can break a system.<br /><br />Thankfully.<br />

				Ok, thanks guys.&nbsp; Current and Future technology is starting to scare me, especially with the ways that law enforcement/our govt chooses to use it against us.
