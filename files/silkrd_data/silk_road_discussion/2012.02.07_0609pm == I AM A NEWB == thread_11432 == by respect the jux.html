				I am a newb to silk road, the only reason I am even fucking with this site is because I just moved 2000 miles away from my city and I have no sources for anything. What do I need to do to convince vendors that I am a legitimate buyer? I&#039;ve acquired bitcoins, I&#039;ve placed 2 orders, I am willing to finalize early with a reputable vendor, but the 2 vendors I have placed orders with are not communicating with me through messages. What piece of the puzzle am I missing here? I have downloaded GPG, still figuring that out. Can some one please educate me? I have used the forum search looking for info for new buyers but I haven&#039;t really come up with anything relevant.

				Hello ! And welcome on SR !<br /><br />Finalize early is not a rule, some vendors accept to work 100 % in escrow even for new buyers. When a seller wants you to finalize early he writes it on his profile, or sends a message to ask for it. Are your orders marked &quot;processing&quot; or &quot;in transit&quot; ? You can&#039;t finalize before it&#039;s &quot;in transit&quot;. <br /><br />In any case it&#039;s never a good idea to finalize early, after a few months on SR and about 20 transactions I finalized before receiving the product only one time, it was for small amount and with one of the top seller. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11432.msg106509#msg106509">Quote from: respect the jux on February 07, 2012, 06:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">is it typical for a vendor to send some kind of confirmation message.. like hey, here&#039;s whats gonna happen.. ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, some send message and others don&#039;t ! It takes time to answer all messages, some sellers seem too busy to do that if they consider it&#039;s useless. <br /><br />WL

				Do not finalize early! You will get scammed that way. Just make an order and be patient. Also take precautions with the address you use to receive them. There isn&#039;t much else to it. Getting here was the hard part :)<br /><br />Welcome to the Silk Road.

				Thank you so much for the info, I have made contact with one of my vendors and everything seems kosher, wasn&#039;t asked to finalize early or anything. I&#039;m starting to get the hang of this, and again thanks for the help.

				I&#039;m a new member too. I just made my second purchase this morning and the vendor has yet to send me a message or process my order. I think this is due to the high volume of sales made over customer appreciation weekend. The vendor has a bunch of orders in front of yours that he still hasn&#039;t been able to process yet. Just wait a few days and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll hear from him or have your order processed.

				The only tip i can give you is check the buyer before you buy. Check the feedback, check the forum and still there is a chance you will get ripped off (e.g. Holland). I&#039;m also not a fan of finalising early, if btc should drop thats the risk the seller should take. They are selling their stuff at 2,3 times the street rate (wich i don&#039;t have a problem with) but they should take the risks involving escrow.<br /><br />In your case the seller is probably too busy after a hectic weekend, so just have patience. Unless if you didn&#039;t check and double checked you probably got ripped off&nbsp; ;)
