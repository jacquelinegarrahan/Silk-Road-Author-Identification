				It seems like a bit of an inane question (maybe it is!) but I am interested as to what drugs Silk Roaders take and indeed buy on here or are planning to buy on here. <br /><br />So far I&#039;ve bought crack and heroin - all of which have been excellent quality and vastly superior to anything I can get at home. The price on SR is definitely high but the high price it is most definitely worth it. I&#039;ve also bought some crystal meth simply because you cant really get it where I am and I&#039;ve been wanting to try it for years. I can&#039;t say I was blown away by it to be honest. I&#039;m not sure if I would do it again. I am considering ordering some DMT as I&#039;ve never done it. Has anyone tried it? I also have always wanted to do PCP so I may order some of that even though I have no idea how you take it. <br /><br />As for the other drugs - weed, extacy, cocaine, acid, ketamine, speed, mushrooms etc - Ive kind of done all them as much as I want to in this life and won&#039;t be taking any of them again. Although I have been considering buying some cocaine and washing it up into freebase. However I have never done that before and don&#039;t want to fuck it up. Is it hard? <br /><br />Even though I dont bother with pills and all that any more I&#039;d still be very interested to hear about quality. For example is the quality of an extacy pill you can get off here far better than you can get at home? Same as the weed? And cocaine? I only ask because in terms of crack and heroin its way better on here than going to local dealers. <br /><br />I just hope the quality of product on here remains high and I think it will simply because if it isn&#039;t people will go back to the dealer down the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />&nbsp;

Richard Pryor famously did just that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27679.msg301934#msg301934">Quote from: Bottrop on June 21, 2012, 07:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just hope the quality of product on here remains high and I think it will simply because if it isn&#039;t people will go back to the dealer down the road. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />From the various products I&#039;ve tried from Silk Road vendors, as long as you research it properly, the quality is impeccable. And that&#039;s where the detail ends I&#039;m afraid. There&#039;s alot of loose talk goes on on this forum about what your real life tastes and interests are. Too much.<br /><br />I already know a bit about &quot;you&quot;: the likely area you live, that you have a dog, that you are unusually well educated and articulate for a crack and heroin user. And you&#039;ve not even been posting for very long!<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m not a big fan of threads that encourage people to reveal personal details. However innocently it&#039;s intended, it helps any LE reading the forum to build up psychological profiles of users and then try and use that information as part of a police interview. If the police guess which forum name you use during a police interview, but pretend they somehow &quot;knew&quot; all along, it would be a very effective way of terrifying people into co-operating. That&#039;s how these people operate.<br /><br />So no more personal questions! But tell us everything about yourself if you must. I don&#039;t recommend it though.

				I smoke cannabis pretty consistently, I also do a variety of prescription meds depending on what I need them for. I&#039;m extremely interested in psychedelics and hallucinogenic drugs. I like the thought of shaking my reality up a bit.

				I think PCP is the only drug I am curious to try. I have done almost all the others, besides a lot of the research chemicals, but there are too many of them to try all, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />

I don&#039;t remember the exact mix but you take .2 of PCP and you mix it with lactose or dextrose (visit shop that sell things to make your own wine) lactose is better. A cap of this mix can gave you 7-8 lines, if you drink 12 beers it&#039;s like you have drinked 24&nbsp; :) this boost your tolerance for alcohol, after two years of doing this i was able to drink 24 beers like this was only one .. only one advice this is an addictive drug, but this is manageable.

				&nbsp;I do a lot of molly, lucy, and RCs. I dabble in opiates but I have to be in the right mood for it. Honestly, I&#039;ve never freaking done coke. I&#039;ve done at least 10 different drugs but not once coke. I feel like a loser... How does coke compare to speed?

				I love LSD, MDMA, pills, K, coke, alcohol.<br /><br />LSD is my favourite. I&#039;m currently waiting for some DMT to arrive from SR, and really looking forward to trying that.<br />I&#039;d love to try Ayahuasca as well, so that will be my next purchase here.<br /><br />I can&#039;t smoke weed...it drives me up the walls with paranoia, so it is not worth it!

				Sheesh, I sometimes wonder whether I&#039;m the only genuine Silk Road user on here! <br /><br />No negs from me though, it&#039;s either love or nothing. Not unless negs are the new +1&#039;s? In which case, I&#039;m doing quite well already!
