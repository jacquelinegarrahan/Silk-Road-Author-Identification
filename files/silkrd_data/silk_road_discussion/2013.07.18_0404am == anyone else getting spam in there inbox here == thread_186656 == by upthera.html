				You should go into your forum profile settings and change it so that it doesn&#039;t show when you are online.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve done that, you won&#039;t receive these spam messages anymore.&nbsp; (and they&#039;re scams, so just delete them!)

I got your contact from the International web site directory. I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to it&#039;s esteeming nature and the recommendations given to me as a reputable and trust worthy person I can do business with and by the recommendations I must not hesitate to confide in you for this simple and sincere business. <br /><br />I am Wumi Abdul; the only Daughter of late Mr and Mrs George Abdul. My father was a very wealthy drug dealer on Silk Road,the economic capital of the darkweb before he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outing to discus on a business deal. When my mother died on the 21st October 1984, my father took me and my younger brother HASSAN special because we are motherless. Before the death of my father on 30th June 2002 in a private hospital here in Abidjan. He secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of 12.500.000 (Twelve Million, five hundred thousand Bitcoins) left in a suspense account in a local Bank here in Abidjan, that he used my name as his first Daughter for the next of kin in deposit of the fund. <br /><br />He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of bitcoins his business associates supposed to balance his from the deal they had that he was poisoned by his business associates, that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose, (such as buying drugs from Silk Road). Sir, we are honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways.<br /><br />1) To provide a Bank account where this money would be transferred to.<br /><br />2) To serve as the guardian of this since I am a girl of 26 years.<br /><br />Moreover Sir, we are willing to offer you 15% of the sum as compensation for effort input after the successful transfer of this fund to your designate account overseas. please feel free to contact ,me via this email address <br />wumi1000abdul@yahoo.com

				Yeah. I was getting spam too. It was something about like.... free bitcoins.... ? I forget. They were also spamming threads with links n shit. From what I can tell they made two different accounts to do it because it was all the same shit. (I&#039;m assuming the one he was using to spam the newbie discussion section got banned or something?) I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m sure you all saw it too, but yeah he inboxed me a couple times under different accounts with that BS. lol
