				To Dread Pirate Roberts:<br /><br />You are a direct reflection of how amazing silk road is. My first purchase on the road was such a hesitant one as I was almost certain this place was a scam. When those first X pills arrived from the NL, I was happier than a 5 year-old on Christmas. My life has not been the same since. No more did I have to be nervous about getting robbed or worried about cops. For the past week, the up and downs of the site have made me uncertain about the outcome. The constant DDoS attacks have made me consider possible LE tactics in an attempt to shut this place down. You have continued working nonstop with up-dates as to the progress you have been making in the counter-attacks. I&#039;m no computer-whiz. I may&nbsp; be more savy than mos of my friends and family t but I have no idea how a DDoS attack works but it is my impression that it is the only way LE could shut this place down (or try to at least) . But your hard work and determination beats any accomplishment I could say I have made it my life. And I am so grateful. You have made such a difference on my life. You have changed the way I go about and getting my drugs that I WILL get Silk road or not and&nbsp; you have DIRECTLY made it much safer and more reliable. There is no amount of praise and gratitude I can give to you for the life difference you have blessed upon me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

				Yes, thanks DPR for your relentess efforts to keep SR up and running and for creating such an amazing concept.&nbsp; This site has probably helped a lot more people and prevented a lot more good than bad and most of the people that use it are good people that I have dealt with, over 120 buys and sells as both a buyer and seller.&nbsp; This site helped me generate enough money to help a close friend/family member for some medical bills.&nbsp; I had an opportunity, I was reluctant to take the risk, but it was the only way I could generate the cash due to my connections to help my close friend get a procedure done that has made her life better.&nbsp; True story... some people just make money but I take risks because I have responsibilities and some times you have to take educated risks take the necessary precautions and press on.&nbsp; SR has been an amazing place for me personally.&nbsp; I truly appreciate all that DPR has done to create this amazing platform.&nbsp;

				Without the road I&#039;d still fear drugs -- i.e. &quot;if I take it, i&#039;ll be hooked and eventually die&quot; -- this kind of thinking was silly.&nbsp; I now understand most mainstream drugs better than I ever could have had I decided to stay in my box and not explore the wide range of ways to alter your consciousness.&nbsp; And all from the safety of my room, I never had to go to some sketch side of town to cop a product I didn&#039;t even know if it was any good.<br /><br />I&#039;ve experienced the highest of highs, lowest of lows, and had a number of ordeals to conquer in order to gain new respect for some of the &quot;hardest&quot; drugs out there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten hooked, and kicked a habit all within this one year I&#039;ve been on the road.&nbsp; Without DPR, obviously many of us chemical explorers would not have been able to access the substances to do this.

				I guess I&#039;ll throw down too, DPR I have been here (under other different accounts since mid-2011, and I have watched your baby expand from from an underground gem to the wide-spread, much needed, spearhead of the drug revolution it is today. MUCH has changed, but its morals have always been there, and those morals, set by you and you alone (as far as I know) keep everybody here safe, and keep many government agencies off our backs, it very well could be a reason that we are still up and running 4 YEARS later...a feat that is extremely amazing, and I personally cant even believe it, even though I&#039;ve not only seen it with my own eyes, but also participated in it. DPR please keep going on, I know you have enough to retire and live a pretty good life, but please you started this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep with it, your intelligence alone can keep it going, your experience is unmatched, nobody else can even come close to it, and many of us rely on you and the road for our own ways of life, many people for income, such as myself, but many also for their life-style choices that are continued safely only because of you...I know many people who used to have to buy cocaine from the hood, and will have had at least one gun pointed at them every time they picked up a bag...but those days where violence and drugs are connected that closely could be over. DPR I would fight for you way before I fight for my own country, because I believe in what you took a stand for, and are still fighting for. Thank You.

				The DDOS attacks might also be from competitors trying to get a piece of the clients :)<br /><br />And they masquerade as some guy DDOSING the place in order to blackmail DPR into giving him money. Of course they know DPR won&#039;t give him any money but that&#039;s not the point. The point is to make us think SR is DDOS&#039;d by LE or a blackmailer when in fact, the people who run other drug markets on TOR are the ones behind the attack. But we can&#039;t suspect this.<br /><br />I did see lots of stuff all over the place: bitcoin forums, btc-e, IRC. When SR was under DDOS the conversations were always the same:<br /><br />&quot;Damn, fucking SR is down for a week now. Good thing we have Atlantis no?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;SR is down :( too bad. Well, I guess Atlantis works bla bla bla&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not accusing anybody of anything. I&#039;m just saying it&#039;s a possibilty.<br /><br />If I started a hidden drug market on TOR, that&#039;s what I would do :)<br />That&#039;s how business usually works.<br /><br />Not that it&#039;s ethical or anything, it&#039;s just the real world we live in. Forget about ethics and morals.
