				Blockchain was posted on another topic: https://blockchain.info/address/1F48CymZsof76oZob8UiCAaz7P4yUdnz7M @ time of posting this (11:54 GMT) he&#039;s so far earned just under 50k. (70k @ 17:26) <br /><br />I&#039;m now down 4.7 btc &amp; kicking myself so hard for falling for this shit. I wasnt prepared to invest until i contacted &quot;DPR&quot; on the main site and he replied. And at that point i jumped at the opportunity and sent this fucker 500$ because i thought that the user DPR couldnt have been unregistered and it was him. I nearly sent 1500$, so thankful i didnt. Some have lost much more then i have. <br /><br />If i&#039;d have JUST gone to sleep when i got home last night at around 4am I would have woke up and seen the hype about it on the forums. After seeing the message i stayed awake to see how this develops as i really wanted one of those apparent 250 spaces *facepalm* ... And&nbsp; i just went ahead with it after receiving a reply from &#039;DPR&#039;... There&#039;s SO many events could have changed this for me and i wouldnt be down 500.. The butterfly effect just raped my wallet hard :-[<br /><br />IM WELL AWARE OF THE FACT IM STUPID AS HELL. PLEASE DO NOT REMIND ME!<br /><br />EDIT: I dont feel AS bad about my situation as i just noticed one person sent this guy over 29,000$&nbsp; :o&nbsp; :o :o

				Scammers tend to try to trap people with their greed - I think the next big thing will be people who pretend to have an early investment opportunity for the successor to Bitcoins - I have been keeping my ear to the ground but haven&#039;t heard anything yet, fingers crossed.<br /><br />Naturally it&#039;s easy to fake legitimacy when everyone is faceless, are you comfortable with verifying PGP signatures? That should put off most people who make some claim of officialdom - I particularly enjoyed an e-mail I received yesterday from a supposed FBI agent which ran JohnBrownfbi @ aol dot com. Seems legit! :-)<br /><br />I can&#039;t predict the market better than anyone else but any mining rigs should be profitable for the time being, although it is possible the Bitcoin will come crashing back down to earth. The ones I invest in are SYNERGY and NASTY - by all means send me a message if you need help using the site.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=141275.msg967092#msg967092">Quote from: Arcturian on April 02, 2013, 11:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=141275.msg967051#msg967051">Quote from: fugitive189 on April 02, 2013, 11:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=141275.msg967021#msg967021">Quote from: Arcturian on April 02, 2013, 10:57 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Blockchain was posted on another topic: https://blockchain.info/address/1F48CymZsof76oZob8UiCAaz7P4yUdnz7M @ time of posting this (11:54 GMT) he&#039;s so far earned just under 50k.<br /><br />I&#039;m now down 4.7 btc &amp; kicking myself so hard for falling for this shit.

				You&#039;re not stupid! Happens to all of us at some point I&#039;m sure. I fell for the torwallet scam because I used them before and nothing happened.

Think of what you still got, and be thankful you were smart enough not to invest your whole $1500!!!<br />You still have your life and I&#039;m assuming and nice pad with access to a computer and your $1,000. Fuck em, and don&#039;t fall for it again!<br /><br />Good luck buddy. Bitcoin scams happened many times before and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll happen many times again in the future.

Such a shame<br /><br />Its cool, i&#039;m not terribly mad about it, the blow was made alot easier to handle because i paid with the coins i got from my sellers bond (money you paid to become a seller). Yesterday i applied for the bond &amp; received the same amount of BTC i paid in (18.80). Except they were around £10 when i paid. That few hundred was turned into 1,200 :) So that was nice, definitely would have been alot more pissed if i just purchased em. The only bad way to look at it is if it hadnt have happened i&#039;d have £320 to blow to the wind right now, but i wont dwell ::)

I need to invest before all the shares are gone.<br /><br />I was thinking of putting around 10k into it. But then I took a few breaths and checked the forums .<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK THE FORUMS FIRST!!<br /><br />People on the forums are lifesavers

				I can understand how somebody might fall for purchasing a drug from a shady seller if their prices look good.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand how somebody good so eagerly go ahead and invest $500 on an anonymous website to a stranger in hopes they&#039;d make more money off it.

				Wait wait.. Wait a minute.<br /><br />I have THREE kind of these messages in my inbox, all 3 different usernames and deposit addresses:<br /><br />The first message is from &quot;SR Staff&quot;, the second message is from &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; and the third is form &quot;STAFFInigo&quot;<br /><br />Since i lost 2 btc last week with the SRAdmin scam, i didn&#039;t fall into the &quot;STAFFInigo&quot; message again. It&#039;s OBVIOUSLY a fake, because of the no spacebar in the name.<br /><br />But..... are you guys telling me that &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; and &quot;SR Staff&quot; are scams too? How the f*** can a scammer get access to an account with a SPACEBAR in the username. And wasn&#039;t &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; the offical vendor support account????<br /><br />..?? Can please anyone confirm that they are all scammers ? Or is &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; real ?

Of course it was a stupid thing to do but it wasnt some kid asking for coins, saying he&#039;ll send back more. It was a very detailed article and what it talked about made sense. My belief is that this was in planning for quite a while. He had various accounts planned and ready to go (Which by the way as italianmafia stated, bypassed the username restrictions). The deal breaker for me was when the user &#039;DPR&#039; replied to me. Now how could a scammer have that user name...? Couple that with peoples excitement / eagerness to get on board this limited time &#039;project&#039; &amp; you have a recipe for a shit-storm<br /><br />And boy, did a shit-storm occur <br /><br />But like i said.

				For me I knew it seemed fishy, because I got three from different sellers, plus the math just didn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />0.1% for $500 = $500, 000. So SR makes 2.5 mil annually but they value themselves at 500, 000. <br /><br />That&#039;s what made it seem way to fishy for me. <br /><br />Also, I have NEVER ever EVER in my 4 years as a buyer and couple months of a vendor got an email from an SR admin that was not from the standard SR Support account. <br /><br />Also if the same person made all three accounts I estimate he actually made closer to $130, 000.....rat bastard -__-

				WOW. 70k? That is downright ridiculous. When I got that message I laughed, and i did not even bother informing SR Support because there was absolutely no way anyone would fall for that. Did anyone try and go to the Forum link where it said DPR was addressing the investment thing? Did it go to a fake website or something? I tried to go to the link but it just went to a invalid thread or something. <br /><br />I feel for all your losses, just try and be more safe with your money.

I find the moderators have very fast response times, and are extremely helpful. <br /><br />Sorry if I offended anyone, just trying to show that expecting a refund from SR is impractical. Not like there is an insurance paid for protection from scam like this, so why would it make sense that they cover it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				wait a minute, this part about not getting a response by admin for 9 hours on whether or not this was an investment scam (previous post)<br /><br />First of all, this is the first rule of grifters. Anything that takes time, like an investment, isn&#039;t going to work. If you&#039;re going to scam people, you have to do it quickly and get out, before the mark realizes he&#039;s been taken<br /><br />You mean to tell me that people couldn&#039;t wait 9 hours to find out if an investment was legit?. If there was anything like a proper investment in SR, it would be on the website and it would be long term, like months and years, not 1 day<br /><br />This, of course, is the same principle that Silk Road is based on between vendors and buyers with the feedback system and for the most part it works. As a new vendor, I had a really tough time getting started but as people started finding out I&#039;m legit, the orders are pouring in now. But people didn&#039;t go for me until they were sure it was legit, and that took at least a couple of weeks<br /><br />the only thing that&#039;s happening in one day is Bitcoin itself, going from 100 to 125 dollars

I would think they might block words like Vendor and Support from usernames now, but I don&#039;t think its reasonable to expect them to foresee this. <br /><br />And I think they must have just gone along the vendors and sent them. They probably messaged a few vendors, saw people were falling for it, and kept messaging other vendors by individually selecting them.<br /><br />Even if it took them 24 hours to message all the vendors that&#039;s still a potential 6000+ an hour. <br /><br />But I totally agree that SR should ban usernames which include such words (Admin, Vendor, Support). Also someone mentioned that all SR staff messages should be in a different font and colour, also a very reasonable suggestion. Hopefully they will implement it, but honestly if you stay aware its easy to stay safe. Its like when the internet was first getting popular and people fell for the &quot;Oh I am a doctor stuck in Nigeria send me $5000 and I will&nbsp; give you $10 000 in 3 weeks&quot;. Live and learn, <br /><br />My sympathies though to everyone, I remember back when BTC was worth $4 and I got scammed out of 10 BTC, I was so pissed. Can&#039;t even imagine how you guys feel. <br />Plus being a single mother with kids to feed I am always way more cautious about these kind of things because of how tight money is. <br /><br />I am wondering, did EVERY single vendor get this email? That IMO would seem a bit fishy, but still possible.

Clearly, it was not DPR. Think about the % fees...not worth his time at all.

A business which grants us access to a free market built on Agorist ideals and principles in which people are free to trade whatever products they wish without government oversight. As it is a free, largely unregulated market, each participant must exercise caution and take responsibility for their own actions.<br /><br />It would seem you have been so wrapped up for so long in a world of regulated businesses and markets where you have legal recourse against any whom may wrong you that you cannot comprehend the concept of an Agorist marketplace, nor recognise the absolute need for absolute personal responsibility when trading in one. It is people that need to do their due diligence or they will lose money, not Silk Road that needs to work to actively protect the foolish.<br /><br />Give me one good, valid reason - backed up by a logical thought process - why Silk Road administrators &quot;need to take responsibility&quot; for the actions of somebody that saw an opportunity to perform a confidence scam and took it. Just one.<br /><br />If I were to con you into sending me a lot of Bitcoin simply by registering a new account that tries to make itself look as official as possible and creating an elaborate story around it, would you honestly expect Silk Road to reimburse you for having the wool pulled over your eyes by a smooth-talking conman?!&nbsp; ???<br /><br />- grahamgreene

It was first proposed by libertarian philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III in 1975.<br /><br />&#039;They&#039; are not calling something else Agorism &quot;these days&quot;, nor is Agorism a label for a theory that goes by many names; the ideology of Agorism has in fact been around since the mid-70&#039;s, and has a clear definition as an individual philosophy.<br />Your comment clearly showed absolutely zero understanding of Agorism, and I would bet 50 BTC that my post was the first time you&#039;d heard of it.<br /><br />Please do &quot;type in bold letters clearly, and spell everything out&quot; - it&#039;ll be interesting to see how you manage to type in bold on this forum. Spelling everything out should be easy enough though because you&#039;re typing it. You&#039;re literally spelling the words letter by letter - I mean you are LITERALLY spelling things out as it is. Feeling stupid yet?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />You really did respond like a child to my previous posts. No, no, I take that back; it is an insult to children everywhere. I certainly hope that this isn&#039;t how you conduct yourself when doing business on Silk Road. If it is, you won&#039;t last long. That&#039;s just a bit of friendly advice in the hope that potential buyers won&#039;t have to receive the same kind of rambling, pig-headed responses that I have.<br />Funny though, you actually remind me of mtljohn.

Dread Pirate Roberts would also agree, I&#039;m sure.<br /><br />However - and not to burst your little fantastical bubble here, but.. there would be no need for Dread Pirate Roberts to perform a confidence scam as he/she could abscond with the funds held in escrow and in user accounts at any time, thereby making a confidence scam about as pointless as your presence here.<br />Given that fact, I consider it highly unlikely (though again, not impossible) that Dread Pirate Roberts is behind the scams. It could also be the entire cast of &quot;Cheers!&quot; for all we know, or &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Maybe try following those leads up?<br /><br />In the interest of fairness though, and to show you how much of a big ol&#039; silly-billy you are, it&#039;s also entirely possible that the entire site is run by a Law Enforcement Agency. That is why we encrypt our sensitive communications, obfuscate our finances, utilise Tor and Bitcoin, trust nobody but ourselves and never reveal our true identities. It&#039;s also the reason we need to have a high degree of - all together now - PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. People do not lose their money if they know that they have to take responsibility for their actions, and act accordingly.<br /><br />It&#039;s been a pleasure rebutting your illogical rambling. You now have the esteemed privilege of being the first person to be placed on my Ignore list.&nbsp; :)<br />Oh, and just so you know, there&#039;s a &#039;Modify&#039; button at the top right hand side of every post you make. You might want to consider using that in future to avoid looking so.. well.. crazy.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Adieu.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
