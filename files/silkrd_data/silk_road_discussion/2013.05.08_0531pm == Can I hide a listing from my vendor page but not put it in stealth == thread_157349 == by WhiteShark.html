				So basically I want to do something a little different that I have not seen before. I want to put a listing for a free hq, and hide it in a random category. <br /><br />Then whoever finds the listing (by chance) will get the free hq. Just thought it would be kind of fun.<br /><br />Obviously I can&#039;t have it on my vendor page because it will defeat the purpose. <br /><br />I know you can put listings in stealth but this will also remove it from the main pages where I need it to be for people to find. <br /><br />Any ideas or is this thing just stupid?

Perhaps you could create a stealth listing and start a thread where you post clues that people could use to figure out the URL.<br /><br />For instance, if the URL were http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/eghd4cb967 you could release a clue for the 10 character unique item URL; for example:<br /><br />&quot;This popular children&#039;s poem character is a delicate chap and really cracks me up - what is he (3 letters)?<br />(First two letters of this word are the first two letters of the URL)&quot;<br /><br />Just an idea! :)<br /><br />Libertas

It would be better for you if a potential customer wins. :)<br /><br />Libertas
