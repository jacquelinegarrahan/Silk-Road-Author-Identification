				I could really use some advice here.<br /><br />Last week I got a letter from Canadian Customs saying that they intercepted and are holding a letter addressed to my mailbox that they found to be suspicious. They want my permission to open&nbsp; it. If I don&#039;t comply within 30 days, they will pass it along to Canada Post and they will then follow their own protocols in dealing with these type of matters. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t and don&#039;t intend to sign it. I&#039;m not sure what the contents of the letter is. My guess is either adderall or codeine pills.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone been through this before. I&#039;d really like to learn from the experience of others who have been through this. I&#039;m trying not to panic or over-react but I am concerned.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Let it ride.&nbsp; If you acknowledge the packages as being yours, you incriminate yourself.&nbsp; Just suck it up and accept the loss.&nbsp; I had a shipment of valium lost due to a US customs letter . ..&nbsp; c&#039;est la vie.&nbsp; I no longer buy from anyone outside the US.

				Thanks Mouseer53,<br /><br />So what happened in the end. Did the matter just &quot;go away&quot; or were you actually approached by any kind of LE, denied that it was yours and the matter was dropped. I realize of course that we&#039;re talking two different countries.

				yes i would definitely say just dont reply as to avoid incriminating yourself. if you give permission you claim the package as yours and the contents become your responsibility pretty sure<br /><br />if its just a small batch i am confident you wont be worth the effort and limited resources, its a common occurrence to find even more serious drugs. probably just confiscate and destroy (enjoy themselves) the package. i have heard of numerous customs letters, all with no consequence, even people ordering to the same address sketchy packages that still arrive after the letter about a completely illegal drug<br /><br />if you end up with someone at your door somehow with the package in the future and have to say something, maybe that you have no knowledge of a package/ werent expecting anything and possibly they will return it to sender or suggest/push for you to take it then i would refuse <br /><br />i dont know how that works exactly and if people ever refuse to accept a package, but i wouldnt want to accept it if you think something is up

				Realize you did not order anything. What&#039;d you do with such letter? I bet you ignore it.<br />So pretend it&#039;s not yours, that would be best, IMHO.

				Hey Shoehorn;<br /><br />Sorry to hear about that - I&#039;m currently shitting bricks right now waiting on an order (small amount) placed almost 3 weeks ago coming from NL. <br /><br />How long did it take for the letter to arrive after placing the order? We talking a &#039;personal amount&#039; of pills? Was it coming from a &#039;flagged&#039; country?<br /><br />Good luck man... hope that shit just goes away...

				What others have said.. Totally ignore it and take the loss.. No need to incriminate yourself...&nbsp; Most likely, you will never hear about it again.

				Thanks to all who replied. I need to&nbsp; lawyer-up for an unrelated matter so I&#039;ll get an opinion and some guidance there. Also, in another thread, I mentioned that some of my computers are dirty and asked about cleaning them. I got some really good advice. I used to work in IT but not in an area that would be helpful in this case. But thanks to those also who responded and gave me good advice. The problem with cleaning them is that if they seize all of our computers, my wife&#039;s computers, which have never seen TOR would also be seized as well and she needs the for her the university courses (distance) that she&#039;s taking. So if the police did come, I&#039;d have really no choice nut to raise my hand.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t think about that before I posted that thread.
