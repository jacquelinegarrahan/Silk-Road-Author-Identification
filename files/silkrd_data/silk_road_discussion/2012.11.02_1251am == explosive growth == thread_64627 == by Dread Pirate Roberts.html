				Hey gang,<br /><br />Just want to keep everyone in the loop.&nbsp; We are in uncharted territory in terms of the number of users accessing Silk Road.&nbsp; Most of the time we&#039;ve been able to keep up with the demand, but we ARE behind the curve right now.&nbsp; Being the largest hidden service ever to exist and having limited options for expanding infrastructure due to the need for security means we may stay behind the curve until we can find a way to accommodate the demand.&nbsp; There are several paths we are currently pursuing and we hope to be back on track very soon.&nbsp; Please be patient and try using the site during off-peak times.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />DPR<br /><br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Another solution has been applied and so far seems to be working.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor the situation and work through this.&nbsp; New registrations are temporarily disabled.<br /><br />I know this has been a frustrating experience for everyone.&nbsp; We aim for 100% accessibility and uptime, but have not met that goal these past few days.&nbsp; I want to reiterate that we are in UNCHARTED waters.&nbsp; Silk Road has gone through many phases and we have grown stronger each time.&nbsp; This won&#039;t be the last time we are challenged I can assure you.&nbsp; This much I can say:&nbsp; we will overcome this obstacle and any other set before us.<br /><br />Also, for the time being, you may have to update your bookmarks by adding index.php after .onion, so silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages becomes silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/messages

				Yeah its been slow of late, but other times just as fast as ever. Dont jeopardize the safety of SR though for numbers or ($$) which im sure you wont, im happy with a slow website as long as its a up and running website. Keep it up !&nbsp; ;D Good thing your doing, I think everyone is realizing what a great place this is, word of mouth spreads fast.

				if overload is easily detected server-side you might want to think about instituting a rolling redirection to a &quot;site too busy&quot; page that is triggered by login session modulo some number.<br />Just like a rolling blackout copes when demand is 110% of supply, it would preserve the experience for the many and temporarily black out the few, for a few hours at a time. This would be better because the site is used in multi-step transactions and it is very frustrating to get half way through something and then see site unavailable after a long pause. Did the form submit? did it not? etc.

				I can get into and use the forums just fine, but the SR website- not so much.&nbsp; It seems as the issue has only been over the last 3 days as prior to that, I would have issues with logging on every other day or so for about an hour (during peak times only) but now it appears that I can&#039;t even log on to the site at all.&nbsp; I have been trying on off-peak times (for the past 48 hours) and feel that others have also and that is why it is still difficult getting on even then.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine what some of the vendors are going through.<br /><br />That was just my experience as I listed above and is NO WAY meant to downplay the importance of ALL THE STAFF and their hard work on this site.&nbsp; Like DPR said, this is unchartered territory and I trust in him and the site as it has been around this long and helps many people in many ways.&nbsp; I am sure LE want to sink this ship asap and any way to keep that from happening is OK with me.<br /><br />A BIG THANK YOU to all!

If you go flashing money up and down someone will find it suspicious and all it takes is a snitch to put the whole operation at stake. I&#039;d already see the most out-of-sense suggestions such as cloud computing, hosting it somewhere... well, I&#039;m programming a market myself and the biggest issue is where to put it to work or how. You can&#039;t simply host it somewhere, with such amount of bitcoins the host may well pick it up and run or may trace your onion traffic or get suspicious, etc. This is a REALLY complicated operation to keep, believe me.

				I know nothing about computers, so this may be an incredibly technologically ignorant post, so I apologize in advance. But what about a waiting list of some kind? The server only allows a certain number of people to be logged in at one time. If you try to log in and the server is full, you&#039;re on a waiting list. If your browser is inactive for an hour, you&#039;re automatically logged out so as not to clog the server needlessly. You can always log back in anyways, so no big deal. I don&#039;t know, just a thought. It might be a temporary solution as you try to increase server size or whatever.

				a Temporary solution that may help would be turn off all images.<br /><br />it would actually be very easy to implement, just put everybody in inconginto mode.<br /><br />could be done in one command.

				I agree with all of the suggestions on this thread. First and foremost, cut off new user registration first for sure until you get some stuff handled. Roll back to a more simple listing scheme like what SR used to look like. We don&#039;t need this to look pretty, just work:) Possibly make the pictures smaller on the listings, or yes, totally get rid of them for a bit. That would be cool if vendors had a higher priority for access, but that would also suck for all of the people that are wanting to buy from us. Thanks so much DPR. You&#039;re a fucking legend man:)

				This site serves a global market, supports users who are connecting from many different time zones and no one really knows where the majority of the active connections are coming from, it&#039;s hard to know when exactly peak demand is. Could the peak hour time be posted in UTC in this thread or stickied somewhere so users know when peak demand is a when connections will be slow. This would allow people to better plan their time when they could connect and place an order, or process them whatever the case may be. If there is a concern giving out this information, perhaps it could be shared in the vendor forum so at least those that do need to get on and get orders out can plan their time when they can connect. Would it be possible to release that information?<br /><br />MJMuse

				The problem with this explanation is it doesn&#039;t fit the symptoms.

Until proven otherwise I am considering the main site compromised. Even if it is still secure, if it&#039;s not functioning correctly it is useless to me. The timing of these issues worry me as it coincides with the hurricane that swept through the NYC area and knocked out a bunch of datacenters in the area. I&#039;m hoping that is only coincidence and not a sign for LE to home in on.<br /><br />The only other time I&#039;ve ever experienced timeouts that took this long to actually error out was when I was personally trying&nbsp; to find out if I could code a website that could run a timing attack vs someone else using tor when we were trying to figure out if it was safe to use. I was not successful but I did only give it an afternoon or two then said the hell with it when another project caught my eye.

				I&#039;m not even getting the login screen (though Vidalia succeeds in opening a connection to SR)<br />Personally I don&#039;t think the site is compromised, what would be the point of stealing a username/password if nobody can log in?<br /><br />If nothing else (and this is a bad idea, kind of like the draft :&lt;) SR could assign user accounts designated times of day (and probably stop new signups for now). People would be able to pick times that suit their time zone as long as there aren&#039;t too many accounts on the same time interval. First come, first serve.<br /><br />I hope DPR and the admins can get some more infrastructure soon though.<br /><br />(If it&#039;s DoS, to hell with whoever&#039;s doing it, though in general it seems to me that would be widely detectable in bandwidth patterns on the Tor network. The etiquette is not to DoS through Tor anyway, though if there were a way I could see the government doing it. I hope it&#039;s not DoS)

				I do not know what the answer is. I would like to say deny new registrations until bandwidth is increased, but I know this goes against any thing SR stand for.<br /><br />All I know is I rather have 10 people reliably viewing my listings, then 10,000 that cant even log on.<br /><br />While denying new registrations could work short term, I think it would just become a flood gate of sorts. As soon as DPR were to feel like &quot;ok, we are good...open regs&quot; ...then the system would quickly become over loaded again.<br /><br />It is sad to say, but I have grown &quot;comfortable&quot; with the fact that I need 2 hours to process orders, instead of the 20 minutes it would take me to get all the info I need off the site.<br /><br />While the site is completely down and out at the moment (and that is no good at all) I recommend to other buyers/vendors that you simply plan accordingly when the site is up.<br /><br />I have a &quot;SR Rhythm&quot; where ... i click a link....then move to another page..do some other stuff....come back.....copy the info....click a SR link.....go to another tab....etc.<br /><br />Its sad, but that is how its been working for me for quite sometime now.<br />

My surprise is that it&#039;s only 22 million since that just shows how young this market still is as literally the sky&#039;s the limit. Based on IRL demand there&#039;s no reason that figure can&#039;t be in the billions. Although I would imagine if DPR were to keep up with the exponential natural growth rate and turned SR into a&nbsp; multi-billion dollar empire he would hit infamy on the Forbes richest criminals list next to all those cartel heads and would easily make the FBI&#039;s 10 most wanted. He might even become public enemy #1 because of his ability to hide in plain sight compared to those transient cartel bosses who are constantly on the move in order to survive. :(<br />&nbsp;<br />At any rate, if he wanted to avoid that type of heat he&#039;d have to hit the brakes at some point ... since there&#039;s a ceiling where further expansion would just increase marginal exposure and cost would outweigh benefit. I&#039;d also imagine that if SR were to expand into the billions there would definitely be new markets springing up to try and grab a piece of that action and they would have to offer some sort of competitive advantage to make them worth using so it could be a win-win. Black Market Reloaded has a leg up now since even though it sucks ... it still exists as the only legit SR alternative.

If the site had indeed outgrown it&#039;s server, I wouldn&#039;t be getting almost instant loading of the login page+ captcha, both of which require available cpu resources to serve up.<br /><br />This basically shows the problem isn&#039;t an overloaded cpu due to hashing. <br />The login page and captcha both load so quickly that it&#039;s obvious the bandwidth isn&#039;t an issue.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The login page is the most served object on the site, since it&#039;s served to everyone. Thus it&#039;s probably cached in RAM, especially if the site is using memcache or varnish. However, other things have to be encrypted and served at the time they are requested. So actually what you are experiencing is perfectly consistent with the idea that the CPU load is the limiting factor, and not the bandwidth.<br /><br />Edit; the captcha has to be encrypted and served on the fly, but you&#039;ll notice that it usually takes a few more seconds to load than the rest of the page, so again consistent the hypothesis.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyone using varnish or memcached on a darknet site deserves to be busted because they would be caching ssl encrypted content BEFORE it gets encrypted. Caching mechanisms being used like that with ssl are totally insecure even on a site that isn&#039;t under law enforcement scrutiny. Even if full disk encryption is used, if access to the operating system is gained, you can then use the disk like normal because it&#039;s already mounted.&nbsp; Do you really want your buying history, pending orders, fan list, etc stored in plain text on a server that&#039;s got a giant bulleye on it constantly?

It&#039;s considered the &quot;corporate stable&quot; branch of the browser based on Firefox 10 with some backporting of security fixes and such. Every time the ESR gets updated, the browser bundle will prompt you to update the release once the browser bundle developers ensure compatibility with the browser bundle.<br /><br /><br />And food for thought, some of use run our tor clients as relays to get more speed out of tor (never as exit node!). With several million people knocked offline in New York, I&#039;m willing to bet we have still lost a chunk of tor capacity due to network outages and people not having power. Tor will often try to use these much smaller relays if the big relays are providing a very dirty circut.

				Apparently you haven&#039;t seen the Comcast forums today. Most of the NE USA is offline on Xfinity. That&#039;s the majority of the high speed (10 MB/s+) internet connections surrounding the jumping off points for transatlantic traffic. If you look at the network map, NY is being avoided like it has the plague while the client tries shooting through Canada instead to cross the pond. There are also pages of complaints in the forums for two of the top 3 wholesale bandwidth suppliers concerning lack of connectivity on several backbones. In short, the internet has gone a bit pear shaped and diced the onion at the same time.<br /><br />

				The nature of how the site has to be setup to keep it running is something a lot of people don&#039;t take in to account.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure if this were hosted out on the clearweb someone running a site like this would have a lot more options in bumping up performance and scalability and all the options would be immediately available.<br /><br />Considering the security aspect and the nature of TOR, a lot of scalability and redundancy options are probably wiped right off the table, no matter how much money you toss at the problem.<br /><br />May be rough waters now but I&#039;m sure it will get back on track at some point.&nbsp; If logging on to SR is your biggest problem today, be happy.

				Seems like this is likely, at least in part, fall-out from the blow-up of Nicolas Christin&#039;s &quot;study&quot; and apparently incessant promotion of it in what are fairly &quot;mainstream&quot; media outlets: NPR Marketplace, Forbes, Wired, etc.<br /><br />Anyone remember the X-Files on Dateline?<br /><br />No one holds the magical crystal ball, but it is the opinion of the ILF that one of the worst things that can happen to us right now is mass media exposure. <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s time to consider getting deeper underground, whatever that means to the admins, roundtable, and community.

I understand people are pissed but this will happen to this site because its the underground of the interwebs and people wanna know whats so good about it so you get mad influx of ppls.<br /><br />Steps to make silkroad secure.<br /><br />1. Invite Only / No selling of invites.<br />2. TorCloud type of service.<br />3. Get rid of accounts which are not active. <br />4. Compress Site into a craigslist type simple format<br /><br />Invite only someone that you trust &amp; will be a regular SR member.<br /><br />ALSO have a donation SR account for upgrade of server equipment etc..<br /><br />

				There should have been a limit placed on memberships a long time ago.<br />You just can&#039;t expect that offering the products this site offers without any limitations would not eventually have serious connectivity issues.<br />We have now perpetuated a site threatening loop - The more people - the more attention - the more attention - the more people..and on and on it goes...<br />There needs to be a temporary holding pattern on signing up any new members.<br />Once the ship is stabilized you can then start allowing a certain amount of new members each month.<br />It really doesn&#039;t matter how much you beef everything up - If one of the statistically major variables (member total) is constantly fluctuating and could increase exponentially on any given day thanks to a single news article then how can you ever hope to stabilize?<br /><br />

If they pass they get the one time code to create an SR account. Also maybe throw in a few questions to approximate mental age (basic psychological methods) to limit teenage substance abuse.<br />Hopefully we can simultaneously cut down on the explosive growth while improving the quality of SR users. I&#039;m not an elitist but I think its a pragmatic way of cutting down on users who don&#039;t know how to follow rules and compromise vendors packaging stealth and waste time and money by submitting an incorrect address. SO this way we don&#039;t close of SR to responsible users but weed out those who make the rest suffer and also reduce the total volume of traffic.<br /><br />I hope SR can take note of some of our suggestions because at the end of the day I don&#039;t think DPR and co. are in this only for the money. These guys are obviously intelligent enough to make plenty of legal money, so they&#039;re doing this for more than just a commission. SR should be faster and better but the users should also be more informed on how it works. We should all work towards a better SR.<br /><br />A big thank you to DPR and co.<br /><br />A big thank you to all you vendors who make this place so awesome and to you buyers for keeping this place afloat. <br /><br />I love all you guys. I&#039;m so glad that there are so many like-minded people who can come together to make the world a better and more free place. And I&#039;m not just saying this because of the sweet cannabis I&#039;m smoking right now ;)

				It&#039;d be nice if we could get an actual reason for the site being offline and not some half assed excuse. The number of users grew so much in two days that things went from working most of the time to not working at all.. ever? Not likely. But I suppose the admins don&#039;t owe us any real explanation, after all we only have hundreds of thousands.. probably millions of dollars tied up in this site.. no big deal.&nbsp; Fucking ridiculous.

				I think this is going beyond heavy traffic and therefore the site being inaccessible <br /><br />first no catpcha - then i was able to login without the captcha somehow, and now the pages only have the top banner but the rest is blank<br /><br />i dont think growth is an explanation for these problems <br /><br />and now just as i post that, the rest of the site comes back visible thankfully

When I put my info and tried to enter it lags out every time. Later it said &quot;site is down for maintenance,&quot; with the SR logo on a white page. Now it&#039;s saying &quot;404 - Not Found.&quot; Just letting you guys know so if it&#039;s happening to you also, you know you&#039;re not the only one.

If they pass they get the one time code to create an SR account. Also maybe throw in a few questions to approximate mental age (basic psychological methods) to limit teenage substance abuse.<br />Hopefully we can simultaneously cut down on the explosive growth while improving the quality of SR users. I&#039;m not an elitist but I think its a pragmatic way of cutting down on users who don&#039;t know how to follow rules and compromise vendors packaging stealth and waste time and money by submitting an incorrect address. SO this way we don&#039;t close of SR to responsible users but weed out those who make the rest suffer and also reduce the total volume of traffic.<br /><br />I hope SR can take note of some of our suggestions because at the end of the day I don&#039;t think DPR and co. are in this only for the money. These guys are obviously intelligent enough to make plenty of legal money, so they&#039;re doing this for more than just a commission. SR should be faster and better but the users should also be more informed on how it works. We should all work towards a better SR.<br /><br />A big thank you to DPR and co.<br /><br />A big thank you to all you vendors who make this place so awesome and to you buyers for keeping this place afloat. <br /><br />I love all you guys. I&#039;m so glad that there are so many like-minded people who can come together to make the world a better and more free place. And I&#039;m not just saying this because of the sweet cannabis I&#039;m smoking right now ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then the forums would be overblow and inaccessible. the reason why we can get on here now is because only like 5% of SR users actually come to the Forums

That wouldn&#039;t be smart.<br />Point 2 and 3 are things I mentioned in my post as well.

I like your idea (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=64627.msg563682#msg563682) a lot and I hope something like this does get implemented. Ultimately though, like you said, the Silk Road is a business and DPR is in the business of making money. I&#039;m not sure of the logistics of this site and why it&#039;s being bottlenecked, but I do know that he&#039;s going to do everything in his power to keep a steady supply of customers. <br /><br />Certainly worthy of DPR&#039;s attention though and I hope he reads it. It would require quite a bit of labor on his part, but with enough trial and error, it might just work. <br /><br />

				I am also noticing very quick responses, but have been seeing the maintenance page on and off for an hour (convieniently when I click finalize).&nbsp; But anyway, I finally got to release the funds, so I&#039;m out for now.&nbsp; Freeing up resources for others.<br /><br />Which is my point--when you as a site user get a timeout or unable to connect error, you are still using resources on the Tor network, and probably the SR servers as well in most cases.&nbsp; So when you hit reload, you are essentially doubling (or more) your per-user resource strain.&nbsp; Keep in mind that *everyone* is likely doing the same, and &quot;everyone&quot; is a record number of users right now.&nbsp; So my advice for the community, is if you aren&#039;t a vendor, or a buyer trying to finalize an order, just lay low and try again in half a day or tomorrow.<br /><br />There&#039;s only so much the admins can do--it doesn&#039;t mean the users are entitled to continously hit reload, and ping the servers more than once, or maybe twice per request.

				I don&#039;t know a lot about how networking and such works, but maybe make two servers, one for purchases under x amount at server 1 and purchases at server 2 are over x amount.

I really feel for all the vendors right now, not being able to answer messages, process orders, cash out etc. I spared this thought when I couldn&#039;t login and release the funds out of escrow earlier today, fortunately I managed to do this an hour ago. Just tried to login now, and SilkRoad is down again, nevermind I&#039;m sure your trying your best DPR, you have 100% of my support through this difficult time&nbsp; :)

				I think we should use my idea. of instituting a forum only account for the first few days. That handles the server load problem, forces buyers to educate themselves and just generally gives them time to acclimate.

While yes this would flood the forum with newbies, a simple solution would be to have a subforum specifically for these &quot;forum only&quot; accounts which is the only area they can post. However they would still be a allowed to view the rest of the forum, hence allowing education, while simultaneously segmenting the clueless( for the first 1-3 days) from the actual SR members. There you could have a few very very very dedicated mods. I&#039;m assuming half of the first page on the newbie forum would be stickies. This is a sort of time delay for DPR and the rest of Silk Road. This would allow stats of the amount of incoming members, while significantly reducing the traffic from these users, allowing DPR and the rest of the SR staff to put in extra servers in the case of mass registrations

				I just want to say thank you for providing this service. The fact that there are so many people using this service is a testament to the power of the Internet and its ability to unite a group of like-minded people despite massive efforts to infiltrate and subvert us. We will prevail, that much I am confident.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any suggestions for the influx. I&#039;m just glad there&#039;s so much competition. It keeps prices down and it makes it less likely that LEO will come after a small fry like me.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Thank you. You are doing god&#039;s work.

				i still dont feel that actually solves anything still imo<br /><br />all it does is delay the traffic and only temporarily for the period of time they are required to wait on the forum - and then you have a constant stream accessing SR again...&nbsp; while subsequently causing many more issues. <br /><br />by re-directing the traffic it would just flood the forum servers likely causing the same problem as on SR now, and also requires tons more effort and work to implement and moderate the new section - all time and effort that should be spent handling the issues on the market... <br /><br />imo the best option has been implemented - temporarily disable registrations while handling the situation and being able to focus effort on the problem - not the forum<br /><br />and registration has been closed for a number of days already JPM... read DPR&#039;s first post in the thread

				If this was Ebay or Google HQ, then expanding the infrastructure would be the way to go. The problem is this isn&#039;t any of those and at some point it will be hard to hide the Silk Road service when its generating a lot of traffic even if its hidden behind the TOR network, I am sure their is a tipping point when LE can go a traffic analysis to work out exactly where the SR servers are located.

				I think this is one of the better ideas perhaps it was good or fate that what happened happened, but I think that closing registration will make vendors and current users appreciate SR more and perhaps take it more seriously now that the fact that once you go your gone, <br /><br />Although that new users cant join this is seriously for the best, SR has gotten so much attention from obviously people of all kinds some smarter than others but there are plenty that ive seen who dont seem up to par ex people who give info of packaging / spreading the word of SR to everyone in the world online in places that shouldnt be, this small change I think people will take SR more serious, those who are here will appreciate it even more than they do now knowing the exclusiveness, I say keep it closed!!! <br /><br />

				While putting in place a registration fee would probably help with decreasing growth, I think it&#039;s a little unfair. I&#039;d assume growth means that people are becoming more relaxed with their position on drugs. Are these new registrants buying?<br /><br />More poeple would make the road a larger target, but in the event of the SR being lost forever, statistically, there would be more individuals willing to devote themselves to making another one.<br /><br />I suppose we are an army in a war for drugs and every new recruit helps...

				Have not read all 18 pages so I&#039;m sorry if this or something similar has been suggested but how about splitting Silk Road into two different sites. Maybe prescription drugs on one site and everything else on the other, that is assuming prescriptions make up about half the sales? You could pay another group to set the second site up, or you could even sell it as a franchise of sorts, which would mean extra cash and would halve your workload. Admittedly it would be inconvenient for all involved, but I don&#039;t like the slow website and the no new people alternative either. I&#039;m from Australia and have been anticipating a boom in the number of aussies using SR so the prices and variety will improve, and I&#039;m sure there are other members from smaller countries who have the same hopes I do.<br /><br />This was thought up and written in ten minutes, I&#039;m sure there are more things to consider, I don&#039;t even know how to setup a regular website, but you get the idea..

				Anyone else receiving a &quot;404 - Not Found&quot; when accessing SR?&nbsp; It seemed problems were fixed over the weekend but now I can&#039;t get the site up anymore. Just curious if it is me or another temporary outage. <br /><br />To add to this thread, I think we should all just be appreciative the site exists and let SR staff figure out what is best, we do not know what problems are actually occurring or what it actually takes for SR to remain online and safe. Remember, a slow site is not good for DPR or anyone else, temporarily stopping new registrants is a good idea but also limits new vendors from coming aboard. Without competition vendors have less incentive to give good prices and services. Staff will figure out the problem but for now we just have to wait. Limiting SR registrations for the time being is a good idea but limiting it &quot;forever&quot; is not and hurts buyers. Just my opinion.

				To the owners of SR - This may be interesting and or important: Other drug sites running on the Tor network also aren&#039;t connecting just like SR. Maybe some government or hacking group is attacking the site for the past two weeks? I know something like this is happening. It just can&#039;t be explosive growth because other drug sites aren&#039;t connecting as well.

				I don&#039;t think splitting up SR into separate &quot;departments&quot; would help at all. It would still have to be hosted on servers. Splitting it up wouldn&#039;t do anything except make it more complicated for buyers and sellers. It would be like shutting walmart down and re-opening 2 smaller stores. It&#039;s just going to mean buyers have to go to more effort to buy a variety of products, and in the end it doesn&#039;t accomplish anything.<br /><br />I hope SR is back up very soon and stays up for for a long time!<br />

				Keep it up DPR you and your team have done wonderful things with silkroad and I am sure you guys will continue to adapt as silkroad continues to grow.&nbsp; This is becoming the front lines on the war and drugs whether or not it wanted to be.&nbsp; As Marc Emery sold and continues to sell millions and millions of cannabis seeds to overgrow the war on weed.. silkroad is a platform for drugs to reach millions of people that may not have had access to them before, or they did but were meeting in a alley somewhere getting some bunk drugs...

				Explosive growth or not, October killed me financially via Silk Road.<br /><br />I had to wait a month on product that more than likely will not make it. That&#039;s fine, because that&#039;s the nature of the business.<br /><br />The caveat is that for the last week of October and the first week of November, I could not access Silk Road past the home page. Definitely not good for business.<br /><br />Now, to be honest, I am exploring all of the deep web to have a back up plan for all my bulk illicit needs.<br /><br />When you have a family, a forum, and a website as revolutionary as the Road, I try hard not to get attached. However, there are vendors I have come to depend on but since I cannot access the site, I will have to siphon funds elsewhere.<br /><br />I really and truly hope DPR rectifies this, or the TOR network is improved. The holiday season is normally a boon for me, but without product I am dead in the water.<br /><br />Now does anyone mind PMing me alternate private seller, invitation only, whatever you call them forums to find alternative bulk situations. I would be greatly appreciative. Hell, I am surprised I am on the forum now.<br />I spent

				The main SR site and the Forums here were almost unusable for me unless it was 3am.&nbsp; If anyone wants to go to the trouble, after installing version 0.2.3.24-rc of the &quot;tor&quot; program they both work the first try every time.&nbsp; I downloaded the source for 0.2.3.24-rc from the torproject.org site, compiled it and installed it, then deleted the version of &quot;tor&quot; in the browser-bundle&#039;s directory and linked the newer one I just installed to the same location (so that when the tor browser starts, it executes the updated one instead of the broken 0.2.2.39 it came with).<br /><br />Warning: I had to go d/l, compile, and install one of the required libraries &amp; fuck with it a bit to compile tor v0.2.3.24-rc, so if you&#039;ve never compiled and installed a program from source in Linux, you probably want to just wait for them to update the browser bundle. Thought it would be helpful for some people that are fed up with SR not working though.

				The address is still the same right? just with the index.php added... I have been having problems all day long connecting. Changing ip&#039;s, restarting tor, using different versions of tor, different routers, nothing fixes it. Just sometimes it is up and sometimes it is not. Tor works if you can connect here on the forums so ... it is the main site that is either too busy or down. But like I said on another post, nothing we can do about it. It&#039;s either up and good for a few hours or down for most of the time these days. Changing identities (tor) does not do anything either, at least for me.

And a couple of other bugs that I didn&#039;t really understand, to be honest.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know precisely what the dir mirrors are used for, but they sound like they&#039;re what direct you to the guards that end up connecting you to the SR site. It may be that somebody is DoS&#039;ing the Tor network.&nbsp; The website itself seems fine -- I mean even after not being able to connect for 10-15 mins, when I finally could, I was still logged in. I don&#039;t know how that could be unless the server was up the entire time and Tor was the problem.<br /><br />I guess it could still be the webserver... I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t make websites or anything, so I could be wrong.

With open registration, once a noob makes it to the forum and reads up they can figure it out fairly easily.

				For a reasonably easy way to scale I&#039;d say SR should split up into smaller sites. Eg. a site for weed, a site for psychedelics, a site for E, etc. Then every now and again synchronize data and stats across sites (and different physical servers). This would not be a permanent solution because at some point they would outgrow their capacity too. But scaling sideways is usually easier than scaling vertically. And the main SR page would just be a static page with links to the relevant sub-sites. Kind of how MMORPGs do it with different shards or worlds.<br /><br />Just an idea.

				It&#039;s obvious that we need to start weeding some people out. Here are some ideas i&#039;ve had.<br /><br />Charge a fee for both buyers and sellers.

Accurate numbers are difficult to acquire, however the report notes that the number of registrations for the Silk Road forum rose by 7762 on February 12 to almost 20,000 by the beginning of May. The number of forum posts rose 97 per cent to 199,538 over the same time.<br /><br />The number of legitimate users of the Silk Road marketplace could be much higher.<br /><br />Each element of Silk Road transactions is wrapped in security. The site operates as a hidden service that hides its server IP address, while users connect through the Tor network which is constantly tested for security holes by thousands of users. Users buy drugs, weapons and other contraband through the untraceable BitCoin online currency.<br /><br />Silk Road users further boost security by discussing techniques to hide drugs from customs and postal services, and by vetting the integrity of sellers and their products. <br /><br />This information sharing was so effective that the report notes existing &quot;forensic examination of posted items and packaging yields no information&quot;, pointing to the sophistication of postage techniques.<br /><br />The report said the impact of the open discussion on the security of the marketplace &quot;cannot be underrated&quot; and suggests law enforcement agencies should heed the lessons and use &quot;power to the crowd&quot; to combat the Silk Road.<br /><br />This would involve an audit of police skills across Australia to map strengths and weaknesses within police cyber units and improve training. It would compliment the previously stated priority given by Australian police for &quot;reducing cross-border barriers to law enforcement and prosecution&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They simply don&#039;t know what to do anymore, this is not what they are trained for. When the PR people are basically saying to the public &#039;we need to audit our skills&#039;, AKA we don&#039;t think we are up for the job, sorry, but that whole drug illegality thing you had going on, it&#039;s not workable anymore. It&#039;s game over for them. And wow what busts, 1 g of cocaine, i mean it becomses so fragmented that... well read their report... <br /><br /><br />

				What&#039;s going on here? that&#039;s what i thought when I was looking for some kind of official crisismanagement going on, but this looks like George W. on a bad day! There is some serious shit going on, and why is that just not communicated on the website. <br /><br />That&#039;s all I gotta say, I hope the guys behind the scenes, DPR and the others that shall intelligently remain nameless, know _exactly_ what&#039;s going on. This server must be state of the art and high end and equipped with all the monitoring facilities and climate control cryptocurrency can buy. And i&#039;ve done some shopping, there is large areas of this Earth that are more or less without law. Take a look at some rumanian providers, and the sites they host.<br /><br />I just hope I don&#039;t have to get used to BMR, cause i kind a liked the green camel. But it&#039;s time to get busy on it, or at least pretend your doing something about it...<br /><br />At least have some kind of messaging going on, have somebody do that, to keep updates about reachability. You cannot measure the number of requests your server gets and where the bottlenecks are? The whole tor network seems very repsonsive to me, i have VPN servers in 8 different countries, so it can&#039;t be country related / or tor related). <br /><br />all right, that&#039;s my two cents on the matter.

				Hah.&nbsp; No.<br /><br /><br />Silkroad does ~20million in annual transactions, and according to that article $2million in commisions&nbsp; Now, this would be fine to support a normal website with millions of hits a day, with much room to spare.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I built a comparable marketplaceish type platform that was load tested at 500 hits a second on an average transaction page(similar for search and messaging).&nbsp; &nbsp;This costs roughly $1800 a month on a cloud host.&nbsp; Thats 21k a year.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not bad.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when one adds in the complexity of doing encryption, making sure no traces are left, etc... The computational complexity goes up exponentially.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />Multiply that 21k figure by 15(maybe even more, and we have a shockingly high figure of $315k a year.&nbsp; Now take into consideration that servers purchasable via bitcoin may be twice as expensive as commonly used cloud type hosting companies.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its not cheap.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				what kind of encryption are you doing? They rely on Tor completely to keep them anonymous and that&#039;s pretty much free... at the endpoint, at the hidden service they are not going to do shit. So basically now the cost of encrypting the OS becomes cost prohibitive, every xbox360 is encrypted on the level of the system bus, it is impossible to know what&#039;s going on inside that machine (well almost). Besides, when the cops actually reach the server, who is going to care about encryption... They need to get their act toegether and get some mirroring going on, something... No i don&#039;t think anything that can be bought for hald cold cryptocurrency can be standing in the way of this site operating fine... But who knows what;s going on behind the scenes...

				You&#039;re funny.<br /><br />There is a difference between encryption, and having a locked down platform that only allows you to run programs that have been signed with a special signature(stored on die with the CPU).&nbsp; The xbox 360 game executables are encrypted, but are de-cryped in order to be executed.&nbsp; This is a simple one time operation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once the game binaries are decrypted, it is loaded in an un-encrypted state into RAM, and executed as normal.&nbsp; The de-cryption on the xbox happens once per game.&nbsp; &nbsp;With a webserver it happens once per PAGE LOAD.&nbsp; &nbsp;See the difference?<br /><br />A hack exists for the xbox 360 to load fully unmodified powerPC linux(xbox360 uses the power architecture).<br /><br />The tor SOFTWARE is free, but doing the encryption/decryption uses many cpu cycles.&nbsp; A server that might be able to handle 10000 requests per second of plain un-encrypted http, may be able to only handle 100 or 1000 requests if those requests have to be encrypted.&nbsp; And what?&nbsp; &nbsp;If the cops reach the servers and they are encrypted with transparent disk encryption, it is very unlikely that they will be able to access the data. (unless the webhosting provider somehow has your root password)<br /><br />Also again, maintaining a coherent transactional environment is not just about the internet/TOR facing webservers, its about having a reliable datastore as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would be willing to bet that in addition to having issues with webserver load, the amount of available database transactions per second probably isn&#039;t enough either.

				A quick check on a relay node&#039;s stats (I asked somebody): currently 133 active connections/clients/onion-routey-thingies, constant 500KB/s up, constant 500KB/s down, constant 7% CPU usage (recent performance-geared consumer level processor).&nbsp; No noticeable memory usage, so that&#039;s negligible for Tor I guess and won&#039;t impact a server beyond the usual RAM-intensive requirements involved with serving up web pages.<br /><br />Even if the simultaneous requests to the server exceed a couple hundred a second, if 1MB/s combined up/down results in a consumer CPU sitting at 7%, I&#039;m sure a server with a dozen or more cores can handle dozens of megabytes per second and still have spare resources for the usual web server load (since the data coming in &amp; going out is what needs to be encrypted/decrypted, it stands to reason it scales with the bandwidth, yes?)<br /><br />The forum here says the most users online ever was 169 (bottom of the page).&nbsp; Apparently this guy&#039;s (consumer-level) computer is handling 133 active Tor streams at the moment and still has resources to burn. Despite the no doubt much higher load on SR than the forums here (2x, maybe even 3x the users -- honestly I really have little or no idea though, in truth), I doubt it&#039;s anything that would bring the server to its knees.<br /><br />BTW, if the Xbox360 is like the PS3, the entire hard drive is encrypted and keyed to the specific hardware in its specific PS3. The drive cannot be accessed as anything but random garbage with any other hardware, even a same-model PS3.&nbsp; The decryption has to be done for every read/write, I would think, otherwise you could just rip the contents of the drive out of RAM with a little tinkering as soon as the PS3 loaded the decrypted data for execution.&nbsp; Not really related, but I tend to ramble when I get going, heh.

				Right, the data stored on the hard drive, and game data on the disks are encrypted.&nbsp; &nbsp;The actual code being executed is de-crypted by specialized hardware designed to do so.&nbsp; The front side bus is most certainly not transparently encrypting and decrypting data to pass off to the cpu.&nbsp; hah.&nbsp; Simply doing on the fly decompression of data that is being read in a linear manner is a relatively efficient operation which the hardware was speced out to do.&nbsp; &nbsp;What I said was the binaries are de-crypted once and loaded into ram, where they are executed normally.&nbsp; Things like textures and maps and whatnot have to be de-crypted as the game is moving along, but then again they are probably also compressed, and decompression/decryption can happen in the same pipeline.<br /><br />On the other hand, trying to do the same thing on an active database server doesn&#039;t work out to well for the hardware involved, because of many random read and writes to the data.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the dataset fits in ram its not that big of a deal for reads, but writes will still suffer heavy performance degradation.<br /><br />What is that particular reley node doing?&nbsp; That load seems offly low for something that is serving anything other than static content.<br /><br /><br /><br />500kb a second doesn&#039;t seem like a lot for 133 active connections.&nbsp; Also even if that is correct, which it way well be, that points to the fact that SRs database is probably what is suffering from too high load.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also you have to keep in mind that this forum is has very simple data structures associated with it(at the database server level).&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s going to be able to handle many, many more hits a second on comparable hardware than a complicated ecomerce site.<br /><br />I do have suspicions that the heavy load is coming from database load, and lack of efficient caching techniques. <br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />The xbox360 uses a specialized hypervisor to do I/O with specialized transparent encryption.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you could theoretically get access to the hypervizors address space, you could access the data.

Accurate numbers are difficult to acquire, however the report notes that the number of registrations for the Silk Road forum rose by 7762 on February 12 to almost 20,000 by the beginning of May. The number of forum posts rose 97 per cent to 199,538 over the same time.<br /><br />The number of legitimate users of the Silk Road marketplace could be much higher.<br /><br />Each element of Silk Road transactions is wrapped in security. The site operates as a hidden service that hides its server IP address, while users connect through the Tor network which is constantly tested for security holes by thousands of users. Users buy drugs, weapons and other contraband through the untraceable BitCoin online currency.<br /><br />Silk Road users further boost security by discussing techniques to hide drugs from customs and postal services, and by vetting the integrity of sellers and their products. <br /><br />This information sharing was so effective that the report notes existing &quot;forensic examination of posted items and packaging yields no information&quot;, pointing to the sophistication of postage techniques.<br /><br />The report said the impact of the open discussion on the security of the marketplace &quot;cannot be underrated&quot; and suggests law enforcement agencies should heed the lessons and use &quot;power to the crowd&quot; to combat the Silk Road.<br /><br />This would involve an audit of police skills across Australia to map strengths and weaknesses within police cyber units and improve training. It would compliment the previously stated priority given by Australian police for &quot;reducing cross-border barriers to law enforcement and prosecution&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They simply don&#039;t know what to do anymore, this is not what they are trained for.

				I guess it depends on how the servers where purchased.&nbsp; &nbsp;If someone at SR wanted to put a bunch of hardware in a colocation facility, it would definitely be necessary to have all the filesystems on the servers encrypted, because in the event that one of those members happened to be traced back to SR, they would clearly not want the fed to have access to all the silkroad data.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I have a strong suspicion that any legitimate company that is accepting payment in bitcoin is under heavy scrutiny by the fed, and other law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; &nbsp;That being the case, the list of companies is not very large, and it would not be out of the question if the FED somehow managed to require said companies to do packet inspection on people paying with bitcoin.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once that is done, a list of people running tor hidden services could be assembled.<br /><br />If SR was smart they would have the database filesystem&nbsp; If not the filesystem, then some sort of custom written compression/decompression system based on some secret data that is not readily accessible on the filesystem.&nbsp; <br /><br />That way if some of the servers were seized,&nbsp; nothing would really happen from it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Are you saying that 133 connections and 500kb/s is the load on the silkroad entry node?

				I like the cut of your jib techguy.<br /><br />The fact is that remotely monitoring any service causes delays...add TOR and the delays are even greater (and what if the team accesses these services via satellite?&nbsp; ADD A LOT MORE TIME LOL).&nbsp; So say a service on a box somewhere freaks out and stops responding, in a perfect world you receive a text or an email the instant it stops responding.&nbsp; I really, really doubt this is the case for SR unless they have a homemade app to check the site every 5-10 seconds and relay a message, even then why the fuck would it go to anything but TOR?<br /><br />Sooooo...SR being a hidden service that only exists within TOR (and clearnet forwarding sites :() I doubt there is truly real time monitoring going on for a lot of reasons.&nbsp; Maybe the guys running the site are out for drinks right now, who the fuck knows...we don&#039;t get that kind of info here nor should we.&nbsp; Patience is a virtue.<br /><br />And of course maybe LE finally hacked the planet, nobody knows until the article runs.&nbsp; I enjoy the downtime right now because checking SR gets fucking addicting.

				It occurs to me: I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to determine from packet inspection at the server machine a given client is connecting via Tor.&nbsp; Honestly even if it is, I don&#039;t see how it would be the least bit useful, since the server has as much access to the network streams it&#039;s handling as it pleases without deep packet inspection or having to look at IP and/or TCP headers.<br /><br />By monitoring the packet stream in the middle while it&#039;s still in the Tor network (e.g. what all our ISPs probably do these days), sure you could tell it&#039;s Tor traffic.&nbsp; Pretty simple.&nbsp; But the entire point of Tor is transparent proxying: shouldn&#039;t the only indication that someone&#039;s using it be the fact that the IP of the exit node their traffic is coming out of has an entry in the Tor directory mirrors?&nbsp; If it&#039;s obvious even after the stream is routed out of the exit node, then Tor would be trivial to squash altogether.

				Presumably peak times are during the evening in either Europe or North America; Australians will probably luck out time wise.<br /><br />Saying that, it&#039;s 2:30 am +10 GMT (Australian East Coast) and not a connection is to be seen :(

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=69563.0<br /><br />This link has good info. Feel better now. The FBI thing is more about large foreign transactions, money laundering and terrorism funding. Bitinstant does have some responsibility to comply at this level just to operate. That said with SR being pretty large it may be an issue they are in the middle of. <br /><br />In the meantime it may be best to keep a mtgox acct. and withdraw when you are ready to buy. It also keeps your funds stable. BTC will surely devalue if SR goes down. It is a factor in stabilizing that economy.<br /><br />Fingers crossed.

				I thought I would chime in here. I do not know the configuration of SR or what they have configured behind the scenes. However, I do know about server loads and balancing the loads.<br /><br />Due to the way Tor works it would make load balancing a web service difficult. In most cases a load balancer would use the address of the requesting party to track a session, something needed for sites like SR.<br /><br />They would have to use a load balancer that follows the session information and balances the load across multiple servers. The servers would have to then communicate to the database or database cluster depending on the size.<br /><br />This in and of itself causes a list of security issues on TOR. The load balancer would have to communicate via TOR but the back-end systems could not be on TOR. If they were the lag would multiply. If you configure the back-end web server and databases without TOR then you open a can of worms with security concerns and you would have to work extra hard to make sure there are no security/information leaks. A single leak could compromise your anonymity! <br /><br />So, I can see how a load spike could cripple the site and it would take a lot of work and testing before a properly balanced design could be implemented.<br /><br />&nbsp;
