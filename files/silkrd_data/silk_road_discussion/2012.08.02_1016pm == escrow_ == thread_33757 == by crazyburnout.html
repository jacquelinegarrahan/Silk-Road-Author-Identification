				Hello and welcome;<br /><br />In short, what happens when you buy something on Silk Road (by placing the item in your cart, then paying for it using Bitcoins after having entered your pin number - don&#039;t send out any money if you don&#039;t recognise that) - the funds go to Silk Road themselves I believe. Here, they take a ~4% fee on the transaction(s) you made and paid for. <br />Once a seller has marked the item as &quot;In transit&quot;, you (the buyer) will have two options - to finalize or resolve. <br /><br />Finalizing is the act of releasing the funds to the seller. It&#039;s basically saying &#039;I&#039;ve received the product safely so there&#039;s the money&#039; sort of thing. Or more so, SR is saying that, I don&#039;t know! <br /><br />But that&#039;s basically what escrow - the act of the funds going to somewhere third party, but only being released to the seller once you&#039;ve received the item. They will still be removed from your account whether you&#039;ve finalized or not. <br /><br />Be wary of new sellers. If they&#039;ve less than 35 transactions, they&#039;ve NO-RIGHT WHATSOEVER to ask people to finalize early (this basically means releasing the funds early before the overall deal is complete - ie - product received). Make sure you report these offenders to Silk Road and they&#039;ll usually give them a message as one-chance-reminder about the Seller Contract, referencing the Seller&#039;s Guide, which must also be adhered to. <br /><br />Hope this helps.
