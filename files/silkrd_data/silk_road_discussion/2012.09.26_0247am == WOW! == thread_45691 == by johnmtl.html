				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />So I had a recent client who purchased some product and left me a 3/5 rating.<br /><br />I just noticed that now I am at 98.9% and not 100% positive feedback like I was prior to the feedback.<br /><br />I contacted the client and asked him if everything was alright and if he was happy with his buds as soon as I saw the 3/5<br /><br />I asked him why he chose to give me only a 3/5 and he said &quot;he expected it to be better&quot; even tho he left a positive note in the feedback.<br /><br />I&#039;m not upset about him leaving a 3/5 if its deserved, but everyone else who has received the same product has left a 5/5 it kinda erks me.<br /><br />I guess SR needs to make a more intense feedback system so peoples points get across, but ratings don&#039;t take a hit unless its warranted.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I hate it when customers do that with reasons like its cutted for sure or the weight isnt enough.<br />If they contacted the vendor and work things out so that everybody is happy there wouldnt be a problem.<br />But instead they dont contact the vendor and give it a bad rating and the number goes down.<br />Not that it bothers me that much but if you number is going below the 60 or 50 i think customers are <br />going to think twice to order something with the vendor.<br />I agree with a better system but i think that is gonna be difficult.<br />

				Maybe he just didn&#039;t understand the significance of feedback ratings on this site. People who are used to just rating things on amazon or rating a movie, etc probably just don&#039;t realize.

				Well that&#039;s just stupid, I may have only gotten your sample tonight but even before smoking it I could tell it&#039;s fairly nice bud! Shit, my fingers got sticky just taking the buds from the vacuum sealing to one of my jars! ;D I grinded up one of those tiny buds of M39 and packed a bowl and it&#039;s been about a solid 2 hours now even after smoking wax earlier in the day, nice! ;) Definitely not a 3/5, fuck that bullshit, should be more like 6/5. :))

				I think there must be a small percentage of buyers that like to take the feedback rating system into their own hands, as if they were reviewing a movie.&nbsp; Seems he gave you 3 stars!&nbsp; Sounds like he received good quality bud in a smooth transaction.&nbsp; I think all reliable SR vendors deserve Oscars!

				A 3/5 and the feedback is... positive?<br /><br />So, he expected it to be better, and docks you 2 points for that? This seems a little excessive, especially considering he didn&#039;t talk with you first.

				Hey John, <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about your rating - My guess is the buyer didn&#039;t know it would affect your overall perfect score. I can vouch for you personally though: to anyone reading this thread; John is really good for communication and delivery. The product is about as top line as you can get and if it&#039;s not then he tells you straight up before you order. If all vendors and buyers had John&#039;s ethics then there would never be any problems with dishonestly or scamming. <br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for my latest order to arrive - gonna be a good weekend!

				Only two words needed to deal with a situation like this, and that my friends and fellow vendors is &quot;Fuck it&quot;. People are going to be pricks, that&#039;s just life. I was at 97.6 and when the maintenance tweaks happened I went down to 93.4 for some reason. Don&#039;t give a shit though, the rating system is unfair IMO and my feedback speaks for itself. I&#039;d rather have a customer read my feedback and make a decision based on what others say than just a number. <br /><br />So to reiterate - Fuck it.
