				So was wondering how much the media has helped out our community by providing us with new people, and helping expand vendors client base.<br /><br />Personally i found this place after digging though the deepweb by chance.<br /><br />Just curious to see the results!

				I think the media has led many of us here. Like they say theirs no bad publicity. if you go off on a rant about how bad a place is because its easy to buy drugs, then everyone wanting to buy drugs will go there no matter how bad you slant the story.

				I was an avid reader of the bitcointalk.org forums for the longest time. I kept catching references to SR. I would look into it a little bit and then get lazy at the part where I had to download Tor to access it. Then I came accross http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable and it motivated me, I HAD to explore this beautiful place for myself.

				Friend.<br /><br />He buys his MJ from here since all he can get near home is shitty shitty shwag.&nbsp; I wanted to get LSD, since it&#039;s been dry for years.&nbsp; He told me how to get on the road, and the rest is history.

				I spent an age looking for all these secret forums out there. Someone off topix mentioned about Silk Road being taken down and busted after the Gawker article. I was annoyed that yet again I missed out and never looked it up as I believed it to be down or one big honey pot. Several dodgy and downright dangerous deals made me do some more research. I was of course delighted to find it alive and kicking. <br /><br />In fact just a quick look at the above results show that most people probably heard of it directly or indirectly from the Gawker article. Is he an employee here? He&#039;s a damned fine salesman ;)

				WoooHooo, post #100<br /><br />I found it while digging around on the deep web. I came looking for something else and stumbled across SR. Realized the opportunity it offered and signed up to be a vendor.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Now I am hooked, this is just too much fun and it gives me a reason to have more shrooms.

				I saw a CNN article that was originally posted on Reddit and decided to do some looking around. I only had to go to the Wikipedia page to find the URL, and downloading TOR was easy. 10 minutes later, I was on Silk Road.<br /><br />I am glad that I personally found out about Silk Road but I think it&#039;s best that the site stay underground for the time being, which means no mainstream media. I know we can only control what the mainstream media does to a tiny extent, but let&#039;s not go looking for things to give the media something to talk about. As the SR &quot;seller&#039;s guide&quot; said, it&#039;s best not to take on too many powerful adversaries at the same time, and SR is still very small and new.
