				All of my go to guys for purchasing bitcoins are currently sold out.&nbsp; I need to get $1,800 onto my account today.&nbsp; I prefer to do a bank deposit, but I may be willing to look at other alternatives if they are safe.&nbsp; If I cannot do $1,800 through one vendor I would consider $900 through 2 separate vendors.

				What services do you use that are out?<br /><br />If you have a Bank of America nearby, I&#039;d definitely recommend CryptoCurrent or BlueSky.&nbsp; Those are my two go-to&#039;s when I&#039;m in an area that has BoA.&nbsp; If not, Bitcopia will take Wells Fargo deposits, but has a 1k limit.&nbsp; You could cover the rest w/ two transactions w/ one of the BitInstant-esque services.&nbsp; Can&#039;t remember the names of all of them and don&#039;t even know if BitInstant is still in business, but just do some searching on here.

				There are some trustworthy people I use to buty BTC on the BITCOIN-OTC irc channel that accept many different kinds of payments. I am sure you can split it into 3 sellers of BTC and be done with it.&nbsp; If you want to know some users that I trust send me a PM. everyone who needs to turn there money into BTC should be on the OTC at least as a backup. Its a quick alternative to having your money tied up in an online market or people who want to have more anonymity and less of a paper trail. plus there is a circle of trust and rating system that the true sellers and buyers are apart of and you can see every transaction, rating and notes about your potential buyer or seller. but of course use cation and ask around the channel or just sit in. you&#039;ll be able to tell who is serious and who is not. oh and NEVER NEVER mention SR, its taboo in that channel. Hope this helps

				I typically go to BST, but I also have a few other email contacts that I&#039;ve used on a consistent basis.&nbsp; I got around to placing my order a lot later than usual and they all are typically sold out by the morning.&nbsp; I ended up going with CryptoCurrent and the transaction was extremely smooth!&nbsp; They&#039;re now added to my list of go to exchangers.&nbsp; Their website only allowed me to do a $1,000 deposit, but you can email them for larger orders.&nbsp; They replied to all of my messages within about 2-3 minutes.&nbsp; The entire conversation took maybe 10 minutes to get everything setup, they gave us the option of which bank branch we preferred too which was pretty cool.&nbsp; I emailed them back while the teller was counting the money at the bank to let them know I just made the deposit, and by the time I made it back to my car I had my coins in my account.&nbsp; Super smooth transaction and extremely quick!&nbsp; Thanks everyone!
