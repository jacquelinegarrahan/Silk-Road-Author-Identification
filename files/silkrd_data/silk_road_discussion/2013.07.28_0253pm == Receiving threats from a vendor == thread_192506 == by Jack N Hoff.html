				Come on Jack...<br /><br />You are smart enough and I don&#039;t think you get sooo annoyed but such acts.<br />Your reputation is far more away that they think and I am sure that if they try their best to &quot;destroy&quot; you fame maybe they will succeed preventing 1-2 newcomers from buying stuff from you..<br /><br />Big deal!<br />Just ignore them. That&#039;s the best you can do.<br />Keep on smiling and let them try...<br /><br />All the best to you my friend<br /><br />Adamiz

				I second that, obviously jealous because you&#039;re doing something right. Trolling, I&#039;ve never seen one post that&#039;s been mildly offensive by Jack.<br />The questions answered, and the help you&#039;ve given the community, are invaluable. Forever my jack reign.

				The fact the guy made a grammatical error, is irrelevant. Why do people hijack and drive the thread off course? A member is being threatened and all you can say is that the protagonist&#039;s&nbsp; English is sub standard. I give up.<br />
