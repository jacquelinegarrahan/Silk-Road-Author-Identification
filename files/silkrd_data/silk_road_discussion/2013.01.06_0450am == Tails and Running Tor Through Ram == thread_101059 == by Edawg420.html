				So I&#039;ve been doing some reading and i would like to up my stealth...but there seems to be some warnings about a middle man attack.&nbsp; I am curious if someone has a good post that can describe the best way to make a USB that runs as its own Operating System and Tor Browser?

				I think the post i read you linked informed me on how to make a tail...i am well informed on how to do that, what i guess i want to know is, 1st is it more obvious using a tail than just using and regular IP and not pretending to be one?&nbsp; Then secondly, if i was going to use a tail and i had access to a computer how likely is it to be traced back to the person using the tail?

				Yes, that&#039;s basically what Tails is, bust I still don&#039;t understand your questions.<br /><br />is it more obvious using a tail than just using and regular IP and not pretending to be one? <br /><br />Are you asking if you&#039;ll stand out more for using Tor? Possibly, in China or Iran, or if LE is looking for a Tor user. Otherwise, no. ISPs don&#039;t generally log your browsing activity other than the amount of bandwidth you consume.<br /><br /><br />if i was going to use a tail and i had access to a computer how likely is it to be traced back to the person using the tail?<br /><br />As likely as using Tor in any other situation. Tails doesn&#039;t increase or decrease the effectiveness of Tor.

				That&#039;s again not even a sensible question.<br /><br />Data on your hard drive doesn&#039;t call attention to you, but it does matter after you&#039;ve called attention to yourself. <br /><br />It&#039;s safer to use Tails and not leave data on your hard drive.

				It&#039;s &quot;Tails&quot; not &quot;a Tail&quot;<br /><br />Tails is an operating system that you can use to access Tor.<br /><br />Brecause of the above, this question makes no sense. <br /><br />&quot;Well does the activity of me using a tail draw more attention than leaving data on a hard drive per say?&quot;<br /><br />Read some stuff on the Tails site and learn more about what it is.

				+1 karma to astor and tor12345 for trying to cut through the confusion.<br /><br />TAILS stands for The Amnesic Incognito Live System<br /><br />It&#039;s not a general term. It&#039;s a linux live distribution made specifically for security as it runs from a ram disk, automatically uses tor for all network connections, and does not store any data persistently. It is actually safest to run TAILS from a CD/DVD as this is a RO media and there can be no accidental or maliciously saved data. <br /><br />Would using TAILS draw attention to you? No one uses TAILS unless they have a reason to. So in that sense, it&#039;s like putting a bank vault in your home and a 50-camera surveillance system and armed guards. Anyone who knows will assume you have some reason for the precaution. That said, the only thing anyone can tell remotely is that you use tor. And locally nothing is stored. Whether using tor in and of itself is suspicious is a question for another thread.<br /><br />The point of using TAILS is that you will leave NO incriminating data behind.<br /><br />And switching from https to http will not protect you from MitM attacks it will only ensure the attack works flawlessly.

				Your question&#039;s already been answered pretty well, but I seem to have more patience than most for explaining... so to really answer your initial question: Tor offers no protection from man in the middle attacks.&nbsp; A Man in the Middle (MitM) attack is when you try to connect to, say, your bank&#039;s web site but a hacker has arranged it so that you connect to his computer instead.&nbsp; How he does this is a bit beyond the scope of your question -- it suffices to say that it requires a nontrivial knowledge of internet routing, but don&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty rare.<br /><br />So anyway, you connect to his computer.&nbsp; His computer then connects to the real bank site.&nbsp; Now the way SSL/TLS (HTTPS) works is that any data communicated between you and the person you connect to is private.&nbsp; But you&#039;re connected to the hacker&#039;s computer, not the real web site -- so... yeah.&nbsp; It being private between you and the hacker doesn&#039;t do a lot of good in this case.&nbsp; The hacker also transparently sends all the data you send to him, right to the bank site.&nbsp; The bank site thinks it&#039;s you, and sends stuff to the hacker (who sends it on through to you, so that you don&#039;t notice it&#039;s not the bank site).<br /><br />The only defense against this are the certificate authorities.&nbsp; They&#039;re basically companies that have been empowered to sell these certificates -- if you have one, it&#039;s supposed to prove that you are a specific domain (google.com is a domain).&nbsp; So your computer should *hopefully* warn you about the MitM attack described above by telling you the certificate of the web site doesn&#039;t check out, but the problem is... it&#039;s not all that hard to get around these certificate authorities and end up with one that says you&#039;re somebody who you aren&#039;t.&nbsp; Neither Tor, nor TAILS, does anything to protect against this.<br /><br />So as eddiethegun here points out, not bothering with any encryption and connecting via standard HTTP (not HTTPS), is only going to make it even easier to perform a MitM attack.&nbsp; If there&#039;s another meaning to Man in the Middle attack, I certainly don&#039;t know it.&nbsp; If that wasn&#039;t what your initial question was about, maybe try describing what your concern is instead?

				i didn&#039;t wanna come out and say it but, it would be more obvious for me to use a Tails rather than say a home computer to check tor info and browsing because i would just cause more attention to myself??

				not sure if it is what your asking, but if you would like to run tails only in the ram, runs faster and you can quickly wipe the ram.&nbsp; when the tails boot menu appears (where it says Live and Live (failsafe) )<br />hit tab and enter the boot parameter toram&nbsp; at the end.&nbsp; remember tails will need at least 1.5 or 2 gig of ram to load the os into.&nbsp; no persistence this way,&nbsp; which is good, just use a whole drive encrypted usb for the purpose of saving any information.<br />using tails or liberte doesnt make you more suspicious, just a little more secure.<br />never connect to tor from your home or phone.&nbsp; always from a bar, coffee shop, ect, and change it up!&nbsp; if there are only few people in your area and many many fewer using tor in your area it is easy to narrow down where tor traffic is coming from.&nbsp; cant tell what you are doing just that you are doing.&nbsp; especially true for vendors to be careful this way!
