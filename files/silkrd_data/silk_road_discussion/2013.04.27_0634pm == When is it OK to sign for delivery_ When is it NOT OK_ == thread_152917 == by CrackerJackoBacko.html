				There are a lot of things that go into this. Say the vendor makes it known that you have to sign for the package. Well, you are automatically taking a risk right there. If that package was intercepted and they do a controlled delivery, they have to have you sign for it and if you know you will have to sign for your goods then you will probably do it and have law enforcement busting down your door in the next minute. From what I have heard from a number of reliable sources is that if they have no other evidence to give them reason for a search warrant then they have to get you to sign to enter and search your house/apt/whatever and if they do have evidence they probably dont need a controlled delivery to come in. Anyone can send anyone anything in the mail and put your name on it. If you accept it with your signature then thats like admitting.<br /><br />The most important thing is know your vendor. They should make it apparent if it requires a signature. If your not expecting a signature and the postal man shows up asking for one. Definitely dont sign. I never accept anything that requires a signature and never have had to bc I avoid vendors that do.

				Thanks, guys. I particularly enjoyed railroadbill&#039;s response.<br /><br />I figured this...just wanted to make sure. And a search didn&#039;t yield decent results.

				I think it&#039;s OK if you know your mail carrier. If it someone else other than your regular mail carrier. Definitely, NO.

Of course be cautious and use your common sense though :) on bigger orders if you want a guarantee of reship/ refund in the event of being lost, the vendor may ask you to sign, and thats fair enough
