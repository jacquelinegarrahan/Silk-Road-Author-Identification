				So,<br /><br />I placed an order 2 weeks ago with vendor InfiniteSource. His SR account appears to be deleted and he is named as a suspected scammer in the forums.<br /><br />Order still has not arrived.<br /><br />I just accidentaly clicked on &quot;Finalize&quot;, vs &quot;Resolve&quot;, on the order, mainly due to my own carelessness, and also due to the proximity between the two buttons.<br /><br />Is there anyway to get these coins back from this scammer who no longer appears to have an account?<br /><br />Recommendations anyone? Admins?<br /><br />I clicked Finalize and the coins appear to have been released, but the SR account InfiniteSource doesn&#039;t appear to exist anymore. Might it be possible to retrieve the coins because of this?<br /><br />At the very least, this is my formal recommendation to move those two buttons further apart. :)<br /><br />UPDATE: SR Support is awesome! They&#039;ve returned the coins!

				There should be a confirmation when you&#039;re about to finalize. When you click finalize you should get a &quot;Would you like to finalize?&quot; with the alternatives of yes and no. Maybe this function already is there, but if it isn&#039;t this should do a lot to prevent miss-clicks.

There is no reason for funds to be returned under non-banned circumstances because the resolution center exists.

				It also depends.&nbsp; If the scammer transfers all the BTC away from the site before they&#039;re shut down, then there is nothing that can be refunded to those who made the mistake of finalizing early.

				Why to the fuck isnt there a &#039;ARE YOU SURE&#039; after pressing the button?&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems like such a simply thing to add for something that could EASILY happen on accident!

				I agree, there should be at least some more space between the two options, I did the same thing a couple of days ago, everything worked out very well..&nbsp; But still, it might not the next time.
