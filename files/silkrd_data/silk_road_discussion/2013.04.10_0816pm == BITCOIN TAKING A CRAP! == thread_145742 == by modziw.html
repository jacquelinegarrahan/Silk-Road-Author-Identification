				Might actually be hello more free money, plus proving this isn&#039;t a bubble. Price has dropped drastically to ~10-110 on some exchanges earlier and already back up past $150-160 from all the demand. I believe what&#039;s happening is a DDOS or attack on BTC artificially but the attackers are about to realize the BTC is here to stay :)

				Following up on the attack idea, here&#039;s what someone posted on another forum:<br /><br />An insider email was leaked onto r/bitcoin a couple weeks ago. Basically a group of rogue traders on Tor organizes a planned DDOS of MtGox at a specific date and time - thus locking out everyone from creating new trades - while simultaneously creating a sell off over 4 hours. The fact that no new trades can be created combined with the price dropping precipitously causes a panic, which grows. At the height of the panic, they buy back in (because they are the ones controlling the DDOS, so they get to make the profitable trades). Everyone else loses their ass who reads the price manipulation as true market price and panics. More people need to understand this because no one is actually panicking at first; it&#039;s price manipulation through the DDOS dropping the price, not actual mass sell off. Still people just blindly look at the price of MtGox and don&#039;t consider this as a possibility even though it&#039;s happened frequently over the last few months. Information is power.

Maybe but I doubt this is what actually happened(I could be wrong). A DDOS attack is when a massive amount of computers are directed at one site to force it to it&#039;s maximun possible connections, either making the site crash or keeping other people from connecting. I don&#039;t know if it is an actual organized DDOS (malicious attack) or an unorganized DDOS (massive amount of people signing in at the exchanges because of the panic of watching the price drop from $250 to $105) It could easily have been both a malicious attack and an unorganized clusterfuck of people panic trading.<br /><br />I feel asleep with BTC at $250, woke up today and it was at $130 then noticed the low on Gox was 105. $145 drop within a few hours is the most volatile I have ever seen BTC at and as of right now as i am writing this it has gone back to $180 (correction--- just checked the ticker at $165, it is probably going to be all over the place for a while and all of this is from Gox. I&#039;m not watching the other exchanges as closely as I should be) from the low of $105 earlier today.<br /><br />My advice to everyone is to not panic. Stay calm, the price is fluxing all over the place, I&#039;ve watched from $130 to $190 back down to $160 so just try and relax. I for one am not going to panic sell and will only panic buy if I see it crash well below $70 (which so far as I am writing this it has not) Either way it goes, don&#039;t be like me and do panic trades.

The low was $105, but that&#039;s still higher than BTC had ever been in its history until like 10 days ago, and it was higher than most of the prices at which people predicted crashes.<br />

				You would think that Gox being the most popular exchange would get use the money they make to expand their server capacity so no one can take advantage of their limited bandwidth but maybe that&#039;s what their in the process of doing as we speak (also $127 now that I&#039;m looking at it)<br /><br />The past few months and including today is the most volatile I have ever seen it, I just never expected a $145 drop within a few hours and BTC not only surge past it&#039;s previous record of $30 in 2011 but also jump more than 7 times it&#039;s 2011 record within 1 month.

				OK So I went to MtGox, and read this in The NEWS Feed.<br /><br />This is exactly what is happening and we are 100% right guys...DDOS<br /><br />Copied and pasted..<br />*********************************************************************************<br />It&#039;s been an epic few days: What happened?<br />&nbsp;TOKYO - JAPAN - April 04, 2013<br /><br />Dear Mt.Gox users and Bitcoiners,<br /><br />It’s been an epic few days on Bitcoin, with prices going up as high as $142 per BTC. We all hope that this is just the beginning!<br /><br />However, there are many who will try to take advantage of the system. The past few days were a reminder of this sad truth.<br /><br />Mt.Gox has been suffering from its worst trading lag ever, 502 errors, and at one point some users were not able to log in their account. The culprit is a major DDoS attack against Mt.Gox.<br /><br />Since yesterday, we are continuing to experience a DDoS attack like we have never seen. While we are being protected by companies like Prolexic, the sheer volume of this DDoS left us scrambling to fine-tune the system every few hours to make sure that things don’t go beyond a few 502 error pages and trading lag.<br /><br />Why has Mt.Gox become the target of a DDoS attack? <br />It is not yet clear who is behind this DDoS and we may never know, but these actions seem to have two major purposes:<br /><br />• Destabilize Bitcoin in general. It is not a secret Mt.Gox is the largest Bitcoin exchange with more than 80% of all USD trades and more than 70% of all currencies. Mt.Gox is an easy target for anyone that wants to hurt Bitcoin in general.<br /><br />• Abuse the system for profit. Attackers wait until the price of Bitcoins reaches a certain value, sell, destabilize the exchange, wait for everybody to panic-sell their Bitcoins, wait for the price to drop to a certain amount, then stop the attack and start buying as much as they can. Repeat this two or three times like we saw over the past few days and they profit.<br /><br />What can be done? <br />Believe it or not, there is pretty much nothing that can be done. Large companies are frequently victims of these kinds of attacks. Even though we are using one of the best companies to help us fight against these DDoS attacks, we are still being affected.<br /><br />There are a few things that we can implement to help fight the attacks, such as disconnecting the trade engine backend from the Internet. By separating the data center from the Mt.Gox website, we will continue to be able to trade.<br /><br />What can you do?<br />Like our favorite author here at Tibanne says… Don’t Panic!<br /><br />“Panic-selling is a wide-scale selling of an investment which causes a sharp decline in prices. Specifically, an investor wants to get out of an investment with little regard of the price obtained.

We all hope that this is just the beginning!<br /><br />However, there are many who will try to take advantage of the system. The past few days were a reminder of this sad truth.<br /><br />Mt.Gox has been suffering from its worst trading lag ever, 502 errors, and at one point some users were not able to log in their account. The culprit is a major DDoS attack against Mt.Gox.<br /><br />Since yesterday, we are continuing to experience a DDoS attack like we have never seen. While we are being protected by companies like Prolexic, the sheer volume of this DDoS left us scrambling to fine-tune the system every few hours to make sure that things don’t go beyond a few 502 error pages and trading lag.<br /><br />Why has Mt.Gox become the target of a DDoS attack? <br />It is not yet clear who is behind this DDoS and we may never know, but these actions seem to have two major purposes:<br /><br />• Destabilize Bitcoin in general. It is not a secret Mt.Gox is the largest Bitcoin exchange with more than 80% of all USD trades and more than 70% of all currencies. Mt.Gox is an easy target for anyone that wants to hurt Bitcoin in general.<br /><br />• Abuse the system for profit. Attackers wait until the price of Bitcoins reaches a certain value, sell, destabilize the exchange, wait for everybody to panic-sell their Bitcoins, wait for the price to drop to a certain amount, then stop the attack and start buying as much as they can. Repeat this two or three times like we saw over the past few days and they profit.<br /><br />What can be done? <br />Believe it or not, there is pretty much nothing that can be done. Large companies are frequently victims of these kinds of attacks. Even though we are using one of the best companies to help us fight against these DDoS attacks, we are still being affected.<br /><br />There are a few things that we can implement to help fight the attacks, such as disconnecting the trade engine backend from the Internet. By separating the data center from the Mt.Gox website, we will continue to be able to trade.<br /><br />What can you do?<br />Like our favorite author here at Tibanne says… Don’t Panic!<br /><br />“Panic-selling is a wide-scale selling of an investment which causes a sharp decline in prices. Specifically, an investor wants to get out of an investment with little regard of the price obtained. The selling activity is problematic because the investor is selling in reaction to emotion and fear, rather than evaluating the fundamentals.” (Source: Wikipedia)<br /><br />I understand that many of you have a lot at stake here, but remember that Bitcoin, despite being designed to have its value increase over time, will always be the victim of people trying to abuse the system, or even the value of Bitcoin decreasing occasionally.

				Anybody know what the current situation is with bitinstant? <br /><br />They apparently were flooded with orders and could not keep up basically because they instantly fund your account but they themselves do not get the money you deposited to them for a few weeks which I could definitely see some problems with that in the current state of BTC flux and this started&nbsp; when the first DDoS happened to Gox at the start of this month so.... Anybody know if it is a good idea to use them right now or are you still dealing dealing with delays? No point using an &quot;instant&quot; service if they&#039;re having delays.

				There is something fishy about this and I believe the DDOS is the biggest red flag in it. The price will return to normal in the next week or so but there will be a crash...sometime but something tells me we&#039;ve probably seen the lowest btc will ever be today at $105 on mtgox.<br /><br />The price will rise again and keep going until 20/4/13 at least and to those who sold during this flash crash never ever ever play poker.

				People need to stop selling bitcoins on MtGox, it&#039;s dangerous that they have such a monopoly on sales, whether this was result of DDoS or not, its just not right that trade of a decentralized currency is so centralized on one company&#039;s servers, especially a company has such poor infrastructure.<br /><br />Forget MtGox, spread the BTCs across more exchanges to strengthen the currency.<br /><br />And don&#039;t worry about the crash, the worst thing you can do is sell off, either trade them or hang onto them and you&#039;ll be glad you did this time next week.

				It&#039;s already back up to $180. I hope no one panicked and sold all their BTC if they bought them in the last week. I think BTC will continue to rise in here.

				MtGox<br />Hi everyone, just a quick update on the situation and what happened last night.<br /><br />First of all we would like to reassure you but no we were not last night victim of a DDoS but instead victim of our own success!<br /><br />Indeed the rather astonishing amount of new account opened in the last few days added to the existing one plus the number of trade made a huge impact on the overall system that started to lag. As expected in such situation people started to panic, started to sell Bitcoin in mass (Panic Sale) resulting in an increase of trade that ultimately froze the trade engine!<br /><br />To give you an idea of how impressive things were here are some numbers that we would love to share with you guys:<br />- The number of trades executed triple in the last 24hrs.<br />- The number of new account opened went from 60k for March alone to 75k new account created for the first few days of April! We now have roughly 20,000 new accounts created each day.<br /><br />Due to these facts we have been busy working on improving things since last week and our team has been working around the clock to improve Mt.Gox to catch up with the demand. We will continue to release several updates today and in the coming few days to improve our system overall performance.<br /><br />Also please note that we may have to close the exchange for two hours in the next 12 to 24hrs to add several new servers to our system.<br /><br />Thank you for your understanding and continuous support!<br /><br /><br /><br />I think it is time to buy....

				It&#039;s important to point out again that there was no &quot;correction&quot;, no mass cash out by early adopters, and no overall loss of confidence in bitcoin. It was a technical failure. Huge lag caused a panic, just like several times before.<br />

Basically a group of rogue traders on Tor organizes a planned DDOS of MtGox at a specific date and time - thus locking out everyone from creating new trades - while simultaneously creating a sell off over 4 hours. The fact that no new trades can be created combined with the price dropping precipitously causes a panic, which grows. At the height of the panic, they buy back in (because they are the ones controlling the DDOS, so they get to make the profitable trades). Everyone else loses their ass who reads the price manipulation as true market price and panics. More people need to understand this because no one is actually panicking at first; it&#039;s price manipulation through the DDOS dropping the price, not actual mass sell off. Still people just blindly look at the price of MtGox and don&#039;t consider this as a possibility even though it&#039;s happened frequently over the last few months. Information is power.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Be careful when looking for explanations of market movements. I am not saying this is not the explanation, but most market participants know that trying to corner any market is a very rare and hard event to pull off. Now I&#039;m by no means a tech expert and there are many things I do not understand about BTC and the operations of MTGOX that could make cornering the market possible, but if you are looking for an explanation to justify your market position, I suggest you don&#039;t. Whenever you start looking for reasons for your trade, you fall into a slippery trap. The reason for the sell off might be what you think it is, and it might not. If it&#039;s not, you become married to the idea that this sell off is not real. Then when the time comes to act you might hesitate because you have the idea that this sell off isn&#039;t real. Those who hesitate in the markets, lose.

				What made that explanation plausible to me -- in fact, even likely -- was the 40 minute lag. I honestly didn&#039;t think traders alone could cause it, but apparently MtGox&#039;s infrastructure is that laughably inadequate.<br />

In the financial world exchanges like NYSE, MTGOX make very small fees and have high overhead costs. They make a living only by increasing trading volume, whereas market makers earn fat spreads between where they buy their coins and where they sell their coins to their retail clients. As long as they are good at managing their risk, Coinbase will most likely stay a market maker instead of taking on a low margin business like an exchange.
