				So in about 40 days me &amp; my best friend will be moving into a dorm at a major university &amp; we&#039;re looking to make some quick cash.<br /><br />we&#039;ve decided that we&#039;d buy &#039;shake&#039; by the oz, roll 1 Gram joints and sell them for $15 each. Overall, we&#039;d make a pretty killer profit if everything goes as planned.<br /><br />my question to SR users: Would you be willing to buy $15 dollar grams of some flame on a regular basis as a college student? Keep in mind these are already rolled joints, on point weight wise of some dank bud.<br /><br />P.S - We both have experience selling bud &amp; around our area its about $15 - $20 a gram

				I&#039;d prefer to roll my own joints and would be weary of someone selling 1g joints. The cynical side of me would think they are shying on the weight by pre-rolling them.

				big sticky juicy buds.&nbsp; it&#039;s the only way your making money......best product (shake no matter how good will never be the best product people want bud porn to show off to their friends)&nbsp; at the lowest price.&nbsp; if you can&#039;t provide that don&#039;t bother because you&#039;re taking way to much risk for little to no profit.

				If the shake is still very top shelf you could use .5g joints as some kind of incentive or as a freebie to increase loyalty (assuming you&#039;re looking long term) but as said above you will make the most money from selling big potent buds. You&#039;re not gonna be the only people selling green there and if all you got is shake joints no-one will buy them unless as a last resort.

				No way would I ever pay $15 for a joint, unless it was pure hash or something lol. <br /><br />The most I would pay is $10 and that&#039;s only if I knew the product was fire. You could do 1gram J&#039;s for $10 and something like 2.2gram blunts for $20. <br /><br />With the prices of shake on SR you would have absolutely no problem making some serious cash off this.

What you&#039;&#039;re referring to we usually call &quot;trimmings&quot; and that is more or less given away for free or just thrown out.<br /><br />He said the J&#039;s would weigh one gram, which is why I said I&#039;d pay no more than $10 for it, even then it better be shake from some really dank weed.

				thank you for all of your opinions. When I say shake I&#039;m referring to what James Harden said.<br /><br />Anyways, after taking in your opinions we&#039;re debating on offering .08 pre-rolled shake joints (will weigh if buyer requests) for $10 &amp; also selling buds for $15 a gram<br /><br />For all the people complaining about the prices.......in my area a GRAM of DANK bud is mostly in the $15 range.<br /><br />I would like to sell some low grade hash since there is literally none in the area I will be living in. How would i go about selling that? How much does is usually go for by the gram?<br /><br />PS - Please try and put yourself in the shoes of a naive college student living on campus looking for a quick easy fix, it seems that some of you are taking this on from a personal point of view. Personally I don&#039;t even like joints and there&#039;s no way in hell I would buy a pre-rolled joint but where I will be living that&#039;s all people smoke.

I&#039;ve decided to offer .8s for $10 to avoid the problem of people feeling like they&#039;re not getting their &#039;bang for their buck&#039; at the $15 price.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No problem! Good luck with it and be safe.&nbsp; You also might want to consider investing in a good scale and buying some speed (amphetamine sulphate) on the road (one of the cheapest items on the road).&nbsp; You can then capsule them up and sell them individually.&nbsp; Of course don&#039;t lie to anyone and tell them it&#039;s something it isn&#039;t, just say &#039;it&#039;s speed&#039; or whatever.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#039;t read any of the other posts in this thread, but I did see &#039;MDMA&#039; when I was skimming, and you could also make a killing off of MDMA.&nbsp; It would be a good idea to buy both MDMA and Speed from a domestic vendor if possible.<br /><br />Basically, college campuses are gold mines, like I said though, just be safe!

You can find it for a fairly cheap price on here, especially if you buy in bulk.
