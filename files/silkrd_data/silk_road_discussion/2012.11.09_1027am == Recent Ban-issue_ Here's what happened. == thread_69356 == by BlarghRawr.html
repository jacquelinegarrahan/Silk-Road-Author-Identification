				One of the mods or admins did an IP-ban on the spammers. Due to the way in which tor works, the hidden-service running on this onion-site treats all connections as localhost(127.0.0.1) which means that everyone who was trying to get in... was banned. The fix is because someone with access to the database cleared the offending IP-ban.

				The admin or mod should have known that IP bans make no sense for sites on tor. Strange way of combating spammers.

				Talk about freak me out<br /><br />I was like WTF did i do to get banned... without even a warning?!<br /><br />Then i figured thats what happened when even as a guest i couldnt get on or register a new account <br /><br />just to confirm, as Blargh suggested, there is an option to ban by IP and in order to prevent the spammers from posting another member with privileges to ban for some reason must have decided to try to ban their IP, but since we all appear to be on 127.0.0.1 it ended up banning everyone

				Yeah, I was like wtf too, wondering what I said to get banned.&nbsp; But then I tried logging in through different machines and as a guest and it wouldn&#039;t let me either so I figured it was a bug.&nbsp; Glad to see everything is working
