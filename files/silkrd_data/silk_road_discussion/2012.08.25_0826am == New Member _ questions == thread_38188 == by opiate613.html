				hey everyone, how&#039;s it going? im a new member here i apologize if this is in the wrong section . I&#039;m happy to be part of the solkroad community and I want to get some orders in as soon as possible. I just finally found a place to get bitcoins from in canada who i can actually just literally hand cash over to and watch him deposit into my account. But I had a question , I am trying to buy H and it seems most vendors want new people to FE , which i dont blame them. But i have been reading about people getting ripped off. is there some people who will provide me with h on this site that won&#039;t rip me off if i FE or is there dealers that don&#039;t make you FE ? just looking for suggestions. thanks in advance

				also another question. i dont know if this makes snese. Say i want to buy .5 of something and it is 12 BTC . does that mean they will only sell that amount is there? like if i only had 10 BTC would they still be able to sell me anything? or would i have to message them and hope for a response? sorry about the questions they are most likely really obvious

Once you pick out a vendor or two try to buy small samples to help your transaction history and to test a vendor. And you can always ask a vendor to do a custom listing but I doubt any H vendor would want to do that. I heard that NoGenRx out of Canada has great gear and is a reliable vendor. Good luck!!

				I have made 3 transactions on SR so far. First one was a no show(my fault) and next 2 went perfect.<br />Can I just give the name and address when I put my small order in cart or do I need to send an encrypted<br />message also? I haven&#039;t quite figured out how to use encryption 100% correctly...but I can read pretty well and I know what<br />to expect from sellers description.<br />Thanks

You could message the vendor and work something out, the vendor might make a custom listing for you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38188.msg430947#msg430947">Quote from: headkase on August 25, 2012, 06:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have made 3 transactions on SR so far.

If the vendor doesn&#039;t say encryption is a requirement on their profile page or listing, then it&#039;s safe to assume it&#039;s not required.
