				Just finished reading a published paper on revealing TOR hidden service locations. The author listed four methods using network analysis and dos attacks. The attacker would need control of only a few nodes. This very well could be LE trying to sniff out Sr server location.&nbsp; The paper was published in 04, not sure if infrastructure changes to tor have been made to combat this or not. In the end, tor was never designed for hidden services. SR should pack up and move to i2p.

				i2p is not totally anonymous, tor is better for hidden services at this point...<br /><br /><br />From the i2p website...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I2P is still a work in progress. It should not be relied upon for &quot;guaranteed&quot; anonymity at this time, due to the relatively small size of the network and the lack of extensive academic review. It is not immune to attacks from those with unlimited resources, and may never be, due to the inherent limitations of low-latency mix networks. &quot;<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t speak to the validity of what you&#039;re saying - I&#039;m not well versed in Tor<br /><br />It&#039;s just nice to see someone speculating intelligently: a theory with some real thought behind it instead of the stupid ramblings of people who don&#039;t know shit about how this stuff works.<br /><br />And of course this thread doesn&#039;t have half the activity of the fear mongering ones. :/
