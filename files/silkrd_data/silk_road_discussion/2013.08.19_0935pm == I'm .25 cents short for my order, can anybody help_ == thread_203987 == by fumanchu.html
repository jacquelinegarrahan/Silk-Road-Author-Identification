				Hey guys,<br /><br />Heres my sitch:<br /><br />I just went through a lengthy (and pricy) process of acquiring BTC, and unfortunately I undershot the amount just slightly... I&#039;m trying to order 7g of hash, and I&#039;m literally about 25 cents short... I&#039;m kicking myself for trying to be cheap/conservative and not putting another dollar down. <br /><br />If anybody has got some extra change leftover in their account that you&#039;re not planning to spend anytime soon, can somebody help me out with about 25 cents worth of BTC? I&#039;d greatly appreciate it.<br /><br />My name on SR is: chutney1<br /><br />Thanks for your time guys

				Just asking the folks who might happen to have cents left over in their account from a previous order that they&#039;re not really planning on spending, thats all. <br /><br />I&#039;ve helped out people on the form twice before in similar situations (granted, one time it was only for like $2.10 and the other time was a dollar something), I&#039;m happy to help people out with pocket change that&#039;d be more of a pain in the ass to exchange back into USD than it would be to put a smile on someones face and help them out with some small change so they can get their order through successfully.<br /><br />Lots of people do it on here, in the 2+ years I&#039;ve been here, I&#039;ve seen a lot of awesome community people helping out others who miscalculated/underestimated the fees they&#039;d have to pay for BTC, and consequently ended up a buck or two short and can&#039;t get their order placed.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not your thing, thanks anyways.
