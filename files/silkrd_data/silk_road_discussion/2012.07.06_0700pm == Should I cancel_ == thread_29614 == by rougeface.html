				So I was communicating with this vendor and everything was great, they were very prompt with answering questions and made me feel comfortable about placing an order with them.&nbsp; So I went ahead and placed the order but haven&#039;t heard anything since.&nbsp; The order is still in processing, I have 6 hours left until cancelling becomes an option.&nbsp; The vendor hasn&#039;t been online in 2 days, but hasn&#039;t responded to messages I left 4 days ago.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of cancelling because I would like to get my money back and order some more product as I don&#039;t really have time to wait on it.&nbsp; Vendor only had 1 previous transaction, but in talking seemed legit and on the ball.&nbsp; I am new here, this is only my second order, so I was wondering if cancelling at this point would seem rushed, or do people agree that it would be the right thing to do?&nbsp; Kind of a noob question I know, but I would appreciate any answers.

				I am not defending this vendor&#039;s authenticity because I have no idea who you are dealing with, but I can give you some general knowledge that might help you out. These vendors are not machines, this website is not amazon.com. You aren&#039;t dealing with a corporation. Most of these vendors are small teams of people, or simply one person, and they ALL have lives outside of the silk road. They ALL encounter problems, small or large, and these problems can appear at any given time. The last thing a vendor needs is for us buyers to constantly message them, especially after our orders have been placed. <br /><br />Check his review threads, read his feedback, open a thread about him in the rumor mill to see what other users have to say about him. BE PATIENT. Like I said, these sellers can get very busy at any time.

				well, it wasn&#039;t wise for you as a newbie to be buying off a guy with just 1 transaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />make a few small purchases off reputable, long time SR vendors.&nbsp; feel it out a little before you decide to take risks on new vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />you always gotta trust your gut, and if you&#039;re feeling like you should cancel when the option is available, then you should just do it.<br /><br />do you mind if i ask what drug you&#039;re trying to buy?&nbsp; and is it a small personal order, or are you getting bulk?

				Well I ended up cancelling, getting my money back and placing an order with another vendor.&nbsp; I gave the first vendor 5 days to reply, and nothing.&nbsp; I am looking for Adderall 20 mg XRs.&nbsp; I&#039;m not taking them to get high, but using them to study while I finish off my last year of an engineering degree, so I didn&#039;t really want to wait any longer.&nbsp; They are kind of hard to come by it seems, so I did want to give the first vendor a chance to get back to me, but I figure 5 days is long enough.&nbsp; I want to keep a good reputation on here, as I think this site is the coolest thing I have come across in a long time.
