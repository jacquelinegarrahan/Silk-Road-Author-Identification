				I don&#039;t think it is safe to order from vendors who don&#039;t sell anything illegal... anyone agree? one way i thought drug police could ruin the road would be to make fake vendors accounts, but they can&#039;t sell illegal drugs, however the could sell other things like baggies and then get addresses to people using/affiliated with SR.... comments?&nbsp;

				And then what??<br /><br />Get a warrent because you bough bags. <br />&nbsp;wouldnt a LE just make a vendors account, accept orders, collect addresses, just never send any drugs?...that&#039;s if they were interested in addresses tho. Which I don&#039;t think they are unless you are a vendor.

				The one that seems like a giant security hole to me is cashing out bitcoins for cash.&nbsp; Especially vendors that only do bitcoins, as bitcoins are not illegal.&nbsp; You have to give out your address to do cash through the mail.&nbsp; If you are a vendor and you are doing this it would be a good idea to get a separate buyers account to transfer bitcoins to first.&nbsp; Otherwise it would be very easy for LE to harvest your address.&nbsp; I am afraid that by posting this I may give them ideas :-/.

				i don&#039;t know where your from but the U.S is full of Do Gooder bureaucrats... im not worried personally but for someone who buys 500 e of here and moves them... i might be a little more worried... you are right about kilos of cocaine though... i stay away from even getting people small amounts of raw because they think you know somebody they want...
