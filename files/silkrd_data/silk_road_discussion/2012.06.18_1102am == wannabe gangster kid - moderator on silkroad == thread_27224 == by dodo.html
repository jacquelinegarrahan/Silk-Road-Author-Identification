				How can it be that a kid like limitless is a moderator on SR forums? I already wondered about this when I saw some posts from him for the first time. I have not even realized he is a vendor until I saw his badass signature.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just looked on his vendor page today and look what I have found:<br /><br />http://image.bayimg.com/hapebaadd.jpg<br /><br />Someone complaining about the product he received and it looks like that this internet gangster kid limetless has threatened the guy now because this bad review. This is just fucking hilarious.<br /><br />If this guy who posted the complain on his vendor page should read this thread, please make the message your received from him public.&nbsp; Everyone should see what a big faggot kid this is. Just look on his vendor page, look what kind of crap he is offering there. He is trying to rip you all off, wake up kids. I don&#039;t understand how someone like this can be a mod here.<br /><br />in before: little cocksucker junkies trying to defend him in the hope to get some of his crappy research chemicals, go on ...&nbsp; ::) ;D

				I&#039;m not defending anything or anyone but...<br /><br />yep it&#039;s a trend here now! If u think he is like that why don&#039;t u post it with the real username instead of creating a new one?<br /><br />how can u say he is a kid? do u know how old is he?<br /><br />&quot;He is trying to rip you all off, wake up kids&quot; Are u the grandfather here on SR?<br /><br />If you were trying to make a point I think u really missed it.... at least with the info u gave<br /><br /><br />

				Are you talking about this feedback:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First of all product is POWDER, definitely NOT crystal like stated in listing. This is the main reason for a poor rating. This vendor is straight up 100% lying to people saying this product is crystallized. Its not even worth paying for a purity test to be done, its obviously not as pure as stated.<br /><br />Product was sent UNLABELLED! Who the hell sends out RCs unlabelled after all the accidents that have happened? Limitless, you are a ticking time bomb. You will really hurt someone because a simple fuck up. Go out an buy some cheap labels and print some labels or something. Number them. DO SOMETHING. Bags that were used are strange, very hard to open and very thin (2mil or under). Item was not sealed in any way other than the bags&#039; zippers (no heat seal). Product was not concealed very well at all inside envelope, if it was inspected it would definitely be seized. Product took over 2 weeks to get to USA. Product weighed in at 1.06g.<br /><br />Overall, Limitless totally missed the boat on this one. Hes basically tossing powders in an envelope and mailing them out... no thanks to that!<br /><br />UPDATE 1: I&#039;ve updated the thread because limitless has messaged me and threatened me or something. He told me that I am being suspicious because I believe he is ripping people off by calling this product crystal. I also updated the original review to make it clearer, I was very angry when I was writing it! lol.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, I read that this morning and had a laugh. So its apparently not pure because it is in powder form, probably crushed up for shipping which is normal practice. But still, its definitely shit stuff. The proof is that he doesnt even need to test it. <br />Next this guy cant keep track of his own shipments so needs to bag the seller. Cmon, how easy is it to know what you have ordered. Maybe writing whats in the package with a big marker right near the address. He then has a little whinge that it wasnt packed properly but expects crystals which will be easily felt through an envelope???? I class good shipping as successfully getting to me. It could have the best packing in the world, but if it doesnt get to me then its useless. <br />Then threatening by saying that he is being suspicious? Fuck man, thats a hard core threat. Wouldnt mess with this guy......<br />Like I said, I had a laugh this morning. And no, havent ordered from Lim and am not after any freebies.

				Ahhhh I know who this is. Anyway yeah, this guy said the product was crystal when it actually clearly is, it&#039;s just micro-crystal not huge crystal like MDMA/Meth/Rice-Crystal drone etc etc. If you really want to get into this and people would like to see what I mean then just ask on here and I&#039;ll take a snap of the product and we can even have a vote to keep it all democratic. <br /><br />Another complaint this numb-nuts said when I confronted him about it was that &quot;The bags were hard to get into and it went everywhere&quot;....errrr sorry Mr Butterfingers LOL. Nobody else seems to have a problem with them. <br /><br />Anyway, nobody else seems to have a problem with either my M1, my packaging or grasping the concept of micro-crystals. Just you. Who decided to give me a 2/5 and then decided to get-wide when I said change it or I&#039;ll put you on the suspect/irresponsible buyer list on the Vendor forum....go figure. In fact my M1 has got some pretty decent feedback and reviews. Off the top of my head I know Sollemnis did one and there are others floating about I believe. <br /><br />Oh and if you want to know who this numb-nuts really is, his name on the Road is CoryTrevor, if you are vendor reading this don&#039;t bother selling to him he will be a bitch.

				Oh and WHY would you label something that is illegal. I have ordered the following things from here and they have NEVER been labelled. Methylone is illegal in the states so if John-Q-Law opened up the package (which got to you safe and sound I might remind you) if I label it with with &quot;METHYLONE, M1, BK-MDMA&quot; or anything like that I have basically done half Mr Piggies job for him. <br /><br />Cocaine (lots and lots I may add)<br />Ketamine<br />MDMA<br />Cigarettes <br />Ecstasy Tablets<br />MBDB <br /><br />None of these have been labelled EVER and I ONLY buy from the top sellers so please OP, if you want to go and have yourself a little bitch fit....fuck off and rail against them too. :)<br /><br />Also If you want to talk shit about the purity you can fuck off till you have proof, send my stuff to a lab for HPLC/HNMR/GC-MS analysis, I know EXACTLY what it will come back with and say and I know EXACTLY how pure it will be. You are basing your speculation on fuck all and you don&#039;t seem to have any grasp of the fact that just because you recrystallize something till the end of the earth and make shards the size of your fist doesn&#039;t make it purer.

				This is the most ridiculous thing I&#039;ve ever read. WHO THE FUCK CARES ABOUT THE BAGS? I&#039;ve found them easy to open... You based some of your feedback over the baggies used? <br /><br />You call Limetless a kid, yet you haven&#039;t even got the intellect to spell his name right. It&#039;s Limetless, not &#039;Limitless&#039;. His M1 is the bollocks mate, I can vouch for that. It was that good, I even made a detailed review of it... Just to say thanks for the good quality! His packaging is one of the best I&#039;ve seen, why did you leave information about his packaging techniques on the feedback? You&#039;re not suppose to do that dipshit...!<br /><br />Read my review if you like, my grammar was terrible in it because I was buzzing of my nut. I&#039;ve ordered twice since, making a total of 3 orders just for the M1!<br /><br />Coming from a guy who has been doing drugs since he was 15, I know quality when I see it. I&#039;m even going to finalise my current order for the M1 now, to try and explain how much of a fuck wit you are on his feedback page. <br /><br />Fair enough, maybe you weren&#039;t completely satisfied (I don&#039;t know why) but even so, you should always contact the vendor to resolve the issue. I know that in my area if you spoke to someone like this, you&#039;d get the shit kicked out of you.

				wtf who is this dodo joker?! i am currently going through with a purchase from limetless and everything so far has been flawless, coms, transaction, providing pics etc.. (apart from something that&#039;s the royal mail&#039;s fault which has meant a couple days of delay, but nothing bad.) i also have no doubt that when it comes, the produce will be exactly as he has described. <br />not sure why someone would make a thread like this, especially when you, supposedly, haven&#039;t dealt with him, and one review out of his many is slightly bad... <br />also naming whats in the bag on the bag, is the dumbest thing ever. Surely you must remember what you ordered...

				Also, this is a new account made by the buyer IMO. Hence why I&#039;m speaking to him as if he were the buyer. Because my instincts tell me it is.
