				patience can pay off, not always but sometimes, I&#039;m still convinced this was NOT captcha time-out problem, but I changed my password to something a little harder to guess and brute

				Holy shit, bro. You were hacked and that money is long gone. This has NEVER happened before to anyone ever. (I&#039;m talking about the login refreshing after trying to log in.)

				Lmao, man. You need to order some benzos while you&#039;re at it. I guess you&#039;re new--SR isn&#039;t a clearnet site so it doesn&#039;t work as well as one. I use SR daily and I get a load time error at least once a day. Just keep refreshing or come back in an hour and try again. I&#039;m sure a more knowledgeable peroson might be able to explain why it happens.

				why wouldnt u be able to log in? try not to use any other sites to get onto SR. as far as login failure, somtimes the page just times out for me, im assuming b/c so many people are trying to get on at the same time, usually i reload the page and login after. sometimes captcha wont load at all, so reloading the page is necessary. you should have your bitaddress so as far as your money goes, u can check if its still there through blockchain
