				Move this if its in the wrong place. <br /><br />I just withdrew a couple BTC to another BTC address. I dont do this often. In the past after I have done it the BTC address shows up in the &quot;Account History&quot; tab.<br /><br />This time the transaction shows up; the coins are out of my accnt, BUT the place where it shows the actual BTC address I sent the coins to is **blank** literally.<br /><br />Just curious if anyone can speak on this. Is this a bug or a feature?<br /><br />PS - I am not &quot;freaking out&quot; about &quot;where are my coins...where did they go?&quot; <br /><br />....yet :)<br />

				This place is quite today. <br /><br />Anyway so uhh yeah, it looks like when I copied the BTC address it had some formatting that came with it (i guess) and then I sent it and now its gone forever. <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t appear that it made it to the other end, and my silly ass didnt copy the BTC address to check the blockchain with as I figured if I needed it I would be able to find it under Account history.<br /><br />Fuck. Lesson learned I guess. Could have been a much more expensive mistake I suppose.<br />

				Contact SR staff if you haven&#039;t already, of course. <br />That is really strange though,&nbsp; gotta be a reason for it.

				IIRC, SR has always left that field blank for withdrawals. If you really want to figure out the address you sent the coins to, you can use the timestamp and amount to search the blockchain for the transaction. Go to http://blockchain.info/blocks and find the first block created after the timestamp for your SR withdrawal, then search within it for the amount you withdrew. If SR&#039;s bitcoin client is functioning correctly, you should find your transaction in the first block or two after the date and time shown in your account history. Hope this helps.
