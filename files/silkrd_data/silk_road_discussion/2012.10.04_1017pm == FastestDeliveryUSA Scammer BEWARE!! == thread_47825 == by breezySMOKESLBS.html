I tell him 600 with express included. He agrees and I set up a custom listing. A few days later he places an order with an OBVIOUSLY FAKE address and a message inquiring about when I would ship the TWO ounces...we clearly made a deal about ONE ounce. Anyway, this address looked fake, and subsequent thorough searches showed that it in fact was a FAKE address. So now I&#039;m sketched out, but seeing as he only has 8 successful transactions I&#039;m guessing maybe he&#039;s just a newbie buyer. So I confirm the order and ask him to send me the real address OR finalize early and I&#039;ll send to this fake address ( No loss for me if he really wants it going to a made up address...and coming back). He decides he&#039;ll send me his REAL address- a new place this time. Then one hour later, he sends another message with a lot of obscene language telling me to just cancel the order, and accusing me of scamming because I asked him to FE.&nbsp; <br /><br />SO I CANCEL HIS ORDER- like he asked and even after receiving his money he goes off on a tangent calling me multitudes of disgusting things and repeatedly accusing me of attempting to scam him...<br /><br />I think anyone sane can clearly see he&#039;s either a total newbie or some sort of failure at scamming.<br /><br />He also told me he had 15000 dollars spent...even though I could see his buyer history, and it wasn&#039;t even a 1/15th of that&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m in the process of adding him on some sort of blacklist or beware list on the vendor forums.<br /><br />-Cheers<br /><br />-FDUSA

Did he think somehow he could claim it at the post office and still claim a full refund because it wasn&#039;t actually delivered? Judging by his language and general demeanor I&#039;m guessing he&#039;s just not that bright and was trying to pull a quick one with some imaginary scheme of claiming the product AND claiming the refund.
