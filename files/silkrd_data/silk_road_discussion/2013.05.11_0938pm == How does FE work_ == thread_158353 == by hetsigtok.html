				I made an order a couple of days ago and I did FE and I cant seem to find where I can update my review on the vendors page.&nbsp; Is it possible to change your review after you have finalized?

				How does FE work?<br /><br />Typically the person would release money and then come to cry on forum when they get nothing for it after a week or two. Then I imagine the person walks around the house saying &quot;I fucked up! I can&#039;t believe I was that stupid to give a stranger cash before I saw the product! I wouldn&#039;t even do that for someone I did know! I&#039;m an Idiot, Tina eat your meat&quot; for a few days to months depending on the amount.

				Be sure to actually go back and update your feedback after you do or do not receive your order too I dont know how many times i see people leave &quot;FE will update later&quot; only to never update later leaving us all wondering what really happened

				I agree with the others. The SR escrow system is there for a reason. It works. Please don&#039;t finalize early, for your own sake as well as that of others.

				Oh jeez - this old chestnut again&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Ding ding ding.. Congratulations, you&#039;re customer number 1000 to spark this debate!<br /><br />IMO the rules and guides about FE are a little outdated. Its happening whether its supposed to or not, so a great way to deal with it would be to offer some information on how to check a vendors credibility more thoroughly instead of trying to fight it. I wouldn&#039;t be here on the road right now if I hadn&#039;t FE&#039;d a few times to eventually deal with the only vendor selling a pure version of my main product, and yeaaaah I got burned one time out of 4, but hey - now im high and im happy&nbsp; 8)

It is not said that just because you did FE you _surely_ will get scammed. I did FE on my first purchase (I wasn&#039;t even asked to but I did it willingly since I had a problem and I didn&#039;t want to cause problem to the vendor in case I couldn&#039;t resolve it in time for auto-finalization to come) and the order did come without problems.<br /><br />Naturally it&#039;s much better to never ever FE, however it is also true that in some (few, but it can happen) cases you have no other option, and in this case it is not said that you will automatically lose money, at all. I think that if you have to FE then you should use intelligence and: A) don&#039;t do it for bulk orders but for sum of money you can accept losing in case something goes wrong, B) try to establish a contact before with the vendor and talk with him/her (in many cases if you do this also if the vendor states he requires FE, if s/he feel that you can be trusted he will not require FE anyway; the forum can also help in this), C) consider well the feedback and how many people who did FE (in case) have updated the feedback with successful shipments.<br /><br />So, OP, even if you did FE (but remember it&#039;s better if you don&#039;t do it in the future, less risk) it is not said that you got scammed and you will not receive your order, at all.
