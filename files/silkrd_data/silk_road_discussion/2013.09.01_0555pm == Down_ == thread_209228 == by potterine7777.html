				I&#039;ve been wondering the same thing...I keep getting page time outs and yesterday (only once) I got the SR home page but it said &quot;The Silk Road is temporarily closed&quot;&nbsp; It was odd because it didn&#039;t specify that it was &quot;down for maintenance&quot; and it didn&#039;t provide the link to the forums for explanation like it usually does.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t stay down long, but I&#039;ve had trouble intermittently accessing the site and navigating from page to page.&nbsp; I&#039;m good with it as long as it&#039;s not another attack...lol&nbsp; I just assumed it&#039;s because of all the changes and tweaking DPR is doing to the site.&nbsp;

It&#039;s Tor, itself, causing the problem. I requested another circuit network (stop/start tor), and SR is running really fast and smooth once I get in. This may have to do with the huge influx of Tor users this week since they are likely not running relays yet and taxing the network a bit.

				I&#039;ve been able to access both the marketplace and forums, but only after a few new identities and a reconnect to tor. I think its an issue with tor because I had some difficulty connecting to the tor network; for some reason it would fail to connect then it would retry a couple more times before finally making a connection. Maybe this has to do with the recent spike in tor usage. <br /><br />Also I noticed that deposits are delayed. Anyone else notice their deposits being slow?

Btc fluctuations can be dramatic on the budget.

No trouble vending effectively. <br />Here are some tricks:<br /><br />Put on your tinfoil hat :-)<br />Make sure silkroad is allowed on noscript (may not really matter)<br />Go to a Https website (you trust) in a browser tab to make sure you have a good Tor connection.<br />Once it loads fully, then, pretty quickly attempt to load SR on a different tab.<br />Once you do so, do Not look at a different tab until SR loads. Keep you mouse curser on the page SR is about to load on.<br />Keep the cursor moving on that page. (apparently, if you click over to another tab or stop moving your cursor, The page gives up trying as hard to load as it assumes you are not really there anymore).<br />Be patient and keep trying if it does not work. I don&#039;t think clicking &quot;try again&quot; (on a failed connection page) works as well as hitting a link/bookmark, or, &quot;go&quot; or &quot;enter&quot; in the address bar.<br />If this is not working, even when you are patient, you can try right clicking the green onion icon to try a &quot;New Identity&quot;.<br /><br />If you get to the log in page and the captcha has letters but no numbers, reload the page until it has both.<br />Once you are in, stay active or you may start to get a slower and slower connection. If that happens, be patient and speeds should pick up again.<br />If SR gets really, really slow; look forward to getting logged out and having to re-log in. I think of that as SR (or Tor?) clearing out the bots. Afterwards things usually run fast again.<br />If you took my &quot;Put on your tinfoil hat :-)&quot; comment seriously at the beginning, you might want to keep it on. Experts would probably tell you you can take it off now, though :-)
