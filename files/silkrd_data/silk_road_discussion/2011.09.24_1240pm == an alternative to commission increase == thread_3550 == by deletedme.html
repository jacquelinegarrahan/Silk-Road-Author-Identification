				Here&#039;s a simple way to increase SR revenue without raising the commission:<br /><br />Advertise! <br /><br />advertisement -&gt; volume increase -&gt; massive BTC influx for SR.<br />For the rest of us the benefits are obvious:&nbsp; &nbsp;more buyers, more sellers, more competition,<br />lower prices ... higher BTC rate.<br /><br /><br />Silk Road, are you ready for this? I think it&#039;s time. <br /><br />everybody else: what do you think of this? Please vote.<br />

				As a seller, I think it&#039;s not a question of good/bad but of *who* are the buyers you advertise to. Sellers don&#039;t want noob buyers as much as buyers don&#039;t want noob sellers. We also in a sense have a &quot;responsibility&quot; to be the frontiers and develop the anonymous marketplace concept.<br />Voted &#039;Good&#039;. Advertise, but only to small closed groups.

				My only concern with advertising is that we may get flooded with LEO and other malicious folks taking advantage of the member increase.&nbsp; It also puts pressure on vendors to quickly move larger quantities, maybe before they&#039;re ready to do so.<br /><br />I dunno about you guys, but anyone I trust I&#039;ve &quot;advertised&quot; through word of mouth, just how awesome SR is.<br />I think building a TRUSTED user base is more important than $$$.

				advertising among your friends is good, but eventually limits the userbase to a number of closed circles. Advertisement has to be wise (e.g., don&#039;t go put up posters in schools), but in the end there&#039;s no way around it. <br /><br /><br />I remember SR before the infamous gawker article. It was great as a place to buy some acid, but, to take one example - there was no coke, and that despite a large and well-voiced demand (several threads in the old forum). And look at the coke section now! and that&#039;s just one example.<br /><br />larger user base is better for all. that&#039;s kinda obvious.<br />

				taking the possible growth rate of SR into account, it&#039;s doing pretty good.<br /><br /><br />gymclasshole user/66035<br />has been a member for 23 hours<br />was last seen: today<br /><br />093809 user/66498<br />has been a member for 3 minutes<br />was last seen: today<br /><br />thats like 450 new users signed up today, if that is a user count number?

				Yeah, that&#039;s 150k+ new users&nbsp; in a year if that&#039;s the actual pace.<br /><br />That&#039;s a lot.&nbsp; I think SR is probably going to burn himself on this new commission thing, but we&#039;ll see.&nbsp; If volumes drop off I&#039;m hoping he responds by at least making it tiered so the per-transaction amounts to a window of BTC versus forking over $60.00 for a $500.00 purchase.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty huge.&nbsp;

				I think those numbers ar right, if you go onto SR marketplace, go&nbsp; your&nbsp; profile and play around with the number in the address bar, there is a member for every number between 66035 - 66498<br /><br />not sure if this is another security flaw or what??
