				There was the option to allow the money to be auto-sent to an outside wallet if there was a problem, but I never set it up.&nbsp; Did anyone who had money on SR get the refund?<br /><br />Just curious.&nbsp; If you did, that means an admin was able to login and hit the panic button.

				I am really curious of this as well. I hope that panic button immediately canceled and refunded all orders and cleared all address data. Some people are insinuating that the SR logo behind the seizure notice is a sign of a kill switch being activiated?<br /><br />I heard that some peoples coins hit their accounts, but I am not sure.

				They nearly hit my account but they appear to have been seized, the block chain won&#039;t update and having googled the error message it seems to be what LE do when they seize them, I really don&#039;t know to be honest.<br /><br />

				Excuse my ignorance, but in other words, you will not be getting those coins through the auto-withdraw system?<br /><br /><br />Second question, this is more for peace of mind, all the btc in my account (kind of stupid for leaving it there), escrow aside, is it safe it&#039;s permanently gone, or by some chance, I don&#039;t know...miracle?<br /><br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				I had quite a few in my account on SR and i had set up the auto-withdrawal but checking today on the safe address...well it&#039;s a nice round 0...<br />so i guess no...<br />btw, Meerkovo are you moving to BMR or sheep or atlantis?
