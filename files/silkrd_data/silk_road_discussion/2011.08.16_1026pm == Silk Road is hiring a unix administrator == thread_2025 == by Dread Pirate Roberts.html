				This kind of makes me a wee bit nervous. Wouldn&#039;t it make sense for you to hire someone that you know and trust? The paranoid me jumped out of his shorts when he saw this ad. What if someone says hire this guy! and that guy is LE...<br /><br />I think that you should find someone that&#039;s in your inner circle. LE would love a way in, and I think you just gave them one....<br /><br />Maybe i&#039;m wrong, but if I were LE and I had some cred here, I would be&nbsp; running to my bosses. &quot;look, they need a IT guy, we have a way in now...&quot; I hope my thinking is crazy... but this makes me nervous....

Its a risk either way you look at it. It all depends on the work that they are doing, etc. The real only way to protect you is make them a partner instead of an employee, that way they have just as much to lose as you do if the wrong info gets into the wrong hands. Making someone a partner that you can trust is probably the safest way to do it.<br /><br />You have a big dilemma, thats for sure. You need help, but dont know who you can trust. I hope whoever you find is trustworthy.

				I think it&#039;s an ingenious idea. Why have a chain of command (so to speak) that can be traced back to you? As long as SR&#039;s got the keys to the server&#039;s, it&#039;s a great idea to have a resident geak help out with day-to-day running of the site. I mean we tend to think of SR is this untouchable jedi master ninja guru, but in reality they&#039;ve a life that for the most part probably doesn&#039;t involve SR. You think they have lunch w their loved ones and say...&quot;ah you guys wouldn&#039;t believe what happened at the office today...someone tried to sell fake heroin so I had to ban them...&quot; No, it&#039;s more than likely very secretive w hardly anyone who really KNOWS...and that&#039;s the way it should be imo.&nbsp; <br /><br />I respect and have a lot of faith in SR. It&#039;s not blind, it has been earned.

				A random advisor could still be in the position to trick you into installing something dangerous. For instance they could work with some sort of software developer, install a backdoor and host it on the actual real hosting site, and tell you to install it. Instantly rooted. I think it should be someone you semi-trust, not some random. Not someone CLOSE to you per say, but someone that you have known for a while, has a history in the scene, and you are pretty confident they are not LE. Hope this helps.

				I see a lot of issues from both sides of the coin, most of which people have already brought up as far as SR&#039;s liability.&nbsp; However as a potential candidate for this position, one would have to ask oneself some tough questions: are you willing to get directly involved in administering a site that&#039;s under a lot of heat right now and for its foreseeable future (senators, DEA, etc)?&nbsp; If SR does get compromised by LE, you&#039;re looking at potentially MANY more serious issues than just being a buyer or even seller on the site (seems like you could be considered a &#039;trafficker&#039; by actively running the site).&nbsp; Just the headache and paranoia of being so closely involved wouldn&#039;t be worth it for me, although I&#039;m sure some people wouldn&#039;t mind the added stress.<br /><br />I take drugs to relieve stress and paranoia, I guess the question is: will the additional drugs one gets from working for SR offset the stress of working for SR?&nbsp; :P&nbsp; ;D

				this makes me really nervous. giving anyone access to part of the site would make it VERY vulnerable to backdoors, etc. also on a related note I think way to much info is stored, every transaction address, order, usernames, etc are all saved for every sale. I know some of this is needed but I think only like 2-3 weeks worth should be saved. <br /><br />also the above poster was right, in the US a cop can do ANYTHING while undercover (drugs, lie, sex with hookers, etc.).

				LE can only do drugs and hookers if their lives are in danger or they are under duress. In a relaxed setting with no dangers or pressures, it is illegal for LE to participate.

I am not trying to highjack (or hijack) this thread, my comments about removing previous transaction history (as naive as they may be) are valid. Especially if a new person is going to be in charge of security as I don&#039;t want them being able to see what I have ordered or where it was sent to. I think many of us are here to throw ideas out there in order to try and make SR as safe as possible. What would give you the impression that I am naive? Also, you attack me for hijacking a thread when your entire post has no relevance whatsoever.<br /><br />I have been asking my programmer friends if they are interested in interviewing for this position but they are hesitant due to the risky nature of the job. Will the compensation be above and beyond a regular 40 hour/week administrator job? I understand completely if you don&#039;t want to make that information public.

I made an order with someone who didn&#039;t use PGP and sent an unencrypted address. I now realize that is was a huge mistake and haven&#039;t done it since. <br /><br />Every post I have seen from Bikerbum is flaming someone for giving their opinion. Yes, I am looking out for my safety and I am also looking out for the safety of SR. Creating the poll about removing guns had nothing to do with my safety. It was aimed entirely an protecting SR from potential LE intervention (but I won&#039;t get into that here.) Here is some more speculation: if your friend is too highly suspicious and paranoid to order from SR what makes you think he will want to work as their security administrator?<br /><br />SilkRoad, I suggest emailing the crew over at Bluelight or Opiophile and ask for suggestions from them as to how you should go about hiring someone for this position. They are likely qualified and knowledgeable about how to hire someone with regards to safety and anonymity.

				<br />Since there is reasonable assumption that SR’s servers are in Europe somewhere, Sweden or possibly Norway.&nbsp; Have you folks considered contacting the enlightened staff over the Pirate Bay? Such a position is much to tempting for the legal community, every limp dicked cop and three letter agency (CIA, FBI, ...) will try for the job. Good luck SR.<br />
