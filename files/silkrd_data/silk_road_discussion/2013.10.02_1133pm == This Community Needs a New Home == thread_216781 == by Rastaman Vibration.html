				I love nothing more than belonging to a community so tight it survives the end of the original reason for its organization. Our voice is already stirring up Sheep Marketplace to include escrow and vendor feedback.

				What&#039;s the URL for BMR? I was easily able to find Sheep&#039;s URL through my Tor browser&#039;s search engine, but the search term &quot;BMR&quot; brings up only unrelated stuff.

				BMR shows it stands up to the test of time, Sheep on the other hand... who? BMR has hundreds of vendors, sheep has dozens. Easy choice. If we split up we fall apart, if we all migrate we will survive. I personally will not be selling on sheep, bmr is the original and its been waiting for its time to shine, give a dog a bone and give them a chance. The platform is not important, the community is. And we go to sheep and they close down in 2 weeks then what? we know BMR will hold up.

				I strongly advice against posting contact information on a forum monitored by LE. I started a topic asking vendors to migrate ASAP. <br /><br />--<br />I suggest all vendors go to the black market (until a better alternative is available). BMR&#039;s biggest problem at the moment is low quality product and low quality vendors (including a lot of scammers). Their system seems alright and has escrow + rating.&nbsp; Sheep market doesn&#039;t have escrow so that&#039;s a big NO NO.<br /><br />In my opinion, BMR is the place to be selling at the moment. If we get the good vendors from SR on that site, it will drive the bad vendors away in no time.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t also &#039;t care much about the FBI watching this forum, browsing through our PM&#039;s. There are only a very few BIG vendors on SR. I mean, common, where I live they don&#039;t even make a bust if they aren&#039;t sure they are finding a few million X pills or more than 1000kg of cocaine.&nbsp; So even if you managed to make a 100k profit, your still a small fish.<br /><br />Also, the whole investigation is actually a big failure;&nbsp; they wasted almost 3 years of resources (while the world economy was collapsing) to find a guy and confiscate less then 3 million USD in bitcoin. Way to go! And they increased street crime because addicts (for example heroine users) will get their fix anyway so I guess they&#039;ll just rob a store and kill the manager because you took their bitcoins.&nbsp; I suggest everyone stops paying taxes because LE is clearly promoting total anarchy.<br /><br />Silkroad was actually one of the biggest solutions on &quot;the war on drugs&quot; because it disarmed the &quot;soldiers&quot; involved. Governments are&nbsp; just to stupid to see it.<br /><br />To finish I would like to say to the FBI fags reading this topic, it&#039;s not you against one man, it&#039;s not you against 1 website. It&#039;s you against 150 000 individual buyers, get real you&#039;ll never win. DPR I wish you the best of luck but don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ve really started something and in my opinion you changed the world forever. <br />--
