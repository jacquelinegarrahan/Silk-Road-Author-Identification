				SilkRoad has said that the SR bitcoin accounts are accounted for. Assuming that&#039;s the case, we have nothing to be worried about. Given how bitcoin works, so long as SR still has the btc address information, your transferred coins will be ok. SR doesn&#039;t have to be up and operational for the accounting to work out since btc accounting is decentralized the way that it is. Unfortunately, anything you transferred to that address is now &quot;locked up&quot; until you can access the account that controls that address. <br /><br />If you fell for one of the fake SR URL&#039;s earlier, your account might be queued up for getting compromised. I&#039;d message SilkRoad here ASAP and log in and change your password the very instant that SR is back up.<br /><br />To sum it up: The good news is your btc will xfer just fine thanks to decentralized accounting. The bad news is that its locked up in that SR based address until SR is back up and you can access your account.<br /><br />FYI: I&#039;m in the same situation of having btc sent to an SR address while SR is down. I&#039;m not worried, just childishly impatient.

				Yes, your coins have been stolen and are being resold on MtGox by the owners of Silk Road right now.<br /><br />Or, maybe they aren&#039;t like every other Bitcoin bank/business/exchange and are legitimate.<br /><br />One of those two...
