I would expect that sorta shit on fbook but this site was based on Libertarian/Agorist principles, who the fuck do these mods think they are censoring people they personally find offensive? fkn embarrassing

Mods like scout, nomad bloodbath and samesamebuttdeliverance were even deleting my posts because they felt butthurt and thought my harmless nonsensical rants were offensive. Anyone else worry these newblood creampuffs (samesame joined in sep 2012) have no idea what the fuck this site is about? I would expect that sorta shit on fbook but this site was based on Libertarian/Agorist principles, who the fuck do these mods think they are censoring people they personally find offensive? fkn embarrassing<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh dear you really are an angry individual, how sad for you. If having one thread deleted has sent you into such a tail spin I&#039;d hate to see your reaction to something really serious. I won&#039;t be drawn into a flame war, I think you are doing a more than admirable job of making yourself look like a total wanker all by yourself. And since you are so obsessed with registration dates you registered in Dec 2012, what have you contributed to the community in that time apart from posting spam? good work mate, really gives you credibility doing that.
