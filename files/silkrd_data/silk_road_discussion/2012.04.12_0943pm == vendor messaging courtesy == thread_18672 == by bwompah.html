				I ordered something relatively small from a vendor over 48 hours ago and it has yet to be shipped. Their listing for the product I ordered has now been taken down, though other listings remain + more have been posted since I made my order. Since the thing I ordered is about to be discontinued by Endo, I&#039;m a little nervous that they ran out of stock and are just planning to cancel my order and then I&#039;ll be kinda fucked. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to be that pesky buyer. Am I right in waiting it out a few more days before sending a message? I don&#039;t care if it takes a while to get here, I&#039;m just going to be majorly disappointed if I end up not getting anything at all, lose some coins in the process, and then this product is off the market for good before I can find another vendor. <br /><br />Just curious what protocol is for something like this. Is there a usual amount of time you guys wait before contacting a vendor?

				First, it is totally cool to message the guy and ask him whats up.<br /><br />Second, it doesnt mean that you will not get your shipment, the fact that the listing is down is only indicates the vendor has no more of that product for sale, it does not mean that all of the product that sold is gone.<br /><br />Third, two days is a little long, it could already be in the mail and he simply has not hit the button yet. <br /><br />Bottom line, message the guy and see whats up.

				Thanks for the reply, Trax. I&#039;ll probably message him tonight to see what&#039;s up. Just wanted to make sure it wasn&#039;t out of line somehow--I&#039;ve never had any issues with slow(ish) shipping before.

				Yeah, I&#039;m sure he just was running low and took it down. The only reason for my concern is other people leaving feedback today on the same item saying it got there in a day or so whereas mine has yet to ship. I also sent this vendor a message a question about possibly combining shipping on a few of his listings but never got a message back, so I went ahead and just ordered the one thing I wanted most. It&#039;ll probably come through and is just taking a minute. Haven&#039;t had it in years and it&#039;s basically my DOC, so I&#039;m just overly excited, I&#039;m sure. <br /><br />Thanks again for the replies, though. I always appreciate the SR camaraderie.&nbsp; :D

				Just out of interest what did you order dude? <br /><br />And yeah you shouldn&#039;t ever hesitate on messaging a seller if you have a queery. I wouldn&#039;t mind anybody shooting me a question about anything I sold, helps put peoples mind at ease and it shows that you give a fuck about your customer. Only thing that might annoy me is if I got the same question over and over again. That would be a vex.

				I message all of my vendors..<br />I want to know if they&#039;ve posted to my country and if I can trust them before buying.<br /><br />Ofc. I don&#039;t spam them with stupid questions.

				With a vendor I&quot;m not familiar with, I normally message them before hand and see how long they take to respond. If they take more than two days to respond. I don&#039;t deal with them. Anyhow if it remains in processing over 4 days, you will be able to cancel your order and get your coins back.

				Hmmm a Vendor I am currently dealing with is starting to annoy me now, he is slow as shit in responses and isn&#039;t very good at speaking English which, when you have Google Translate isn&#039;t the best. And my package hasn&#039;t arrived. 5 days from NL to the U.K, this normal?

Everything I&#039;m reading on the forms says this vendor can be slow, but always manages to come through, so I&#039;m gonna try to hold out on canceling for another day. We&#039;ll see?

				For what it&#039;s worth, the vendor from my original post ended up never once responding to any of my messages and then cancelled the order after about a week of no contact. It was pretty lame, but no big loss--I just won&#039;t order from them again. Fortunately it wasn&#039;t something I wanted/needed immediately, so I was able to get it from a different vendor and there were no issues. <br /><br />I won&#039;t hesitate to message any vendors in the future (without just whining and nagging them, of course). I figure it&#039;s part of their job to respond to buyers&#039; reasonable and respectful inquiries, and if they aren&#039;t able to communicate at least a little, then they probably aren&#039;t a top quality vendor.<br /><br />Thanks again to everybody who responded to this thread. I&#039;m glad someone else found it helpful, too. SR&#039;s community certainly has scammers and trolls, but most people on here just want everyone to get good products and have a great time. It&#039;s fantastic.
