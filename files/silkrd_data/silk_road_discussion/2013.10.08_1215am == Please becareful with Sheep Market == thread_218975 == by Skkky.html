				Theres been a lot of main stream media promoting Sheep and you have to ask WHY??&nbsp; &nbsp;Just Google &quot;Sheep Market&quot; and see how many articles and reports are available basically promoting it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This can be the biggest bust in history if this site is run by FEDs. <br /><br />http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-04/goodbye-silk-road-hello-sheep-marketplace.html

I really amn&#039;t sure if they really know what they&#039;re doing however. When I asked support if they had a coin tumbler/mixer earlier, they asked me to explain what one was. Nuff said, really.

				Sheep did not come out the day SR was shut down... it just became popular on that day for obvious reasons.<br />It was around well before the shutdown, not as long as bmr, but it didn&#039;t just spring up as a result of what happened here at SR.

				pretty sure it has escrow..... when you order something you have various options in regards to raising a complaint or finalizing etc.<br /><br />also this is from the help page<br /><br />&quot;15) See the Orders. The order has been submitted and is in transit. If 21 days inactive customer automatically receives money vendor.&quot;<br /><br />that would imply their is escrow....<br /><br />*edit* LOL II read what I pasted from the help page a number of times... over and over.. and yeah.. its err.. open to interpretation but it sounds like its saying if the customer is inactive the vendor gets the money.. same as SR... i.e auto finalize... <br /><br />I think the problem is just english may not be the first language.<br /><br />where/why are you saying no escrow ?? what are you looking at ?

				I think language barrier is most definately an issue with the Sheep folks. Noticed other grammatical anomalies and confusing statements. If they really do have escrow fo sho, then I might be game... Their interface is must less of a clusterfuck than BMR, I hate searching that site.

				BMR AND Sheep have scammers, over time they will raise vendor prices, but most vendors dont have $600 to gamble at the moment to get on a market that they do not know will succeed or not after all the&nbsp; money was seized. You will get scammed on BMR, The road, or sheep if you do not practice safe buying. that is why there is ESCROW! it is the best security, if you FE, you should not be buying anything unless the vendor is well known. please understand bmr is a great place, not as flashy and not as many pretty lights as sheep, but look at SR. If you pick sheep because of its interface, you deserve to go down with that ship. 99% of vendors prefer BMR, and i have been the BMR spokesman as i have been around since BMR came up, it was always the fallback plan, now the gullible heard over to sheep because of a fancy design instead of looking at the important things, like not loosing money or going to jail. BMR will improve, sheep will crash. Think of how many markets we have seen recently? how many have made it? 1... BMR. Good luck guys, especially if you trust sheep, i will not be found there.

				Everyone needs to give sheep a chance. All I have heard the last few days is &quot;oh the feds run this, the feds run that&quot;. To be honest they probably are not running anything! Just the fact that the sheep supports first language is not English is enough for me to believe its not the Feds. Also sheep does have escrow. Got some green off the Herbalist on Saturday and it arrived Monday. It is a little confusing the escrow system but works fine.<br /><br />Just give it a chance. Bmr looks like something my nephew designed. Terrible interface, it was enough for me not to join.<br /><br />Also some of the vendors have been registered on Sheep for 6 months so its not just popped in the last week. Be interesting to see the updates on bmr, surely they need to address the interface? Anyway time will tell.<br /><br />Stay safe brothers,<br /><br />ProEvo

I had heard of sheep before The Fall, but hadn&#039;t been there... hadn&#039;t been to BMR either though....<br /><br />I am a little wary of Deepbay, but only because they were all over this thread like thrush the day after the takedown - transparent desperation. It could be that they were simply doing no business and needed the commerce badly, or it could be more sinister than that... we&#039;ll see....<br /><br />The bottom line is this; these market places ONLY work because you don&#039;t NEED to trust the website owner. I didn&#039;t trust SR any more than I trust Sheep, BMR, or Deepbay now, when I first started. But if you always use PGP/GPG, if you use TOR correctly, if you get you delivery system tight, then it&#039;s FAR less risky than street-deals and I don&#039;t see what the FBI or any other LE would get out of running them - they wouldn&#039;t get any busts. They didn&#039;t even bust DPR through technological hacking, but through classic detective work.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t think that the people running a market not being from an English-speaking country is an issue. I&#039;m not racist, and I do alot of business with non English-as-first-language people IRL. It may even be a bonus, since the FBI clearly had a much easier time nabbing DPR as he was in the USA. My biggest problem with them is they seem to have no kind of idealistic/political views about what they&#039;re doing; no statement of purpose or mission statement or anything. I enjoyed the fact that DPR wasn&#039;t JUST running a black-market, it felt more political than that. BMR, Sheep, and Deepbay, just do not feel as radical, just much more mercenary. <br /><br />Right now none really stand out. All have pros, all have cons. Only time will tell how it pans out...

				I LOVE how that one guy who said he would never be found there now has it in his profile sig that he is a vendor there! LOL SHEEP IS AWESOME! They speak good enough english, today when dealing with support it didn&#039;t sound broken at all and I HIGHLY doubt they are in the USA which was BY FAR DPR&#039;s fucking most stupid mistake.<br /><br />NO ONE LIKES BMR! SHEEP HAD LIKE 70 DRUG LISTINGS BEFORE THE ROAD WENT DOWN NOW IT IS CATCHING UP TO BMR AND GUESS WHAT? SHEEP LOADS GREAT AND BMR HAD TO NOT LET ANYONE ON THE SITE BECAUSE THEIR SERVERS WERE SO FUCKING SHITTY BEFORE THE ROAD WENT, YOU ACTUALLY THINK THERE GONNA HOLD UP? THEY HAVE TONS OF UPGRADING TO DO BUT FOR NOW SHEEP IS WINNING. I HAVE LITERALLY GOT MORE THEN 10x THE BUSINESS ON SHEEP THEN BMR BECAUSE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE SAID, A FUCKING KID COULD DESIGN THAT PIECE OF SHIT INTERFACE! PEOPLE ARE TRUSTING SHEEP MORE WHICH IS PATHETIC BECAUSE BMR HAS BEEN AROUND SO LONG BUT IT FUCKING SUCKS! THE FEDS CAN&#039;T SET UP SITES LIKE THIS, I AM SORRY BUT YOU GUYS ARE MORONS FOR THINKING THEY WOULD AS WHAT COULD THEY ACCOMPLISH?
