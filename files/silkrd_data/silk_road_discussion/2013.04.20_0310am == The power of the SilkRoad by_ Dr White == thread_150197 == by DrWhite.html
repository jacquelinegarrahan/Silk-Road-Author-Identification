				Greetings Fellow Silkroaders!<br /><br />SILKROAD IS NOT just a darksite....It is NOT about money. This Silk Road is bigger than any of us. In fact it us bigger and more powerful than anything like it could have ever dreamed of.. Zuckerburg? i got a big FUCK YOU for you right here.... Facebook kisses the government&#039;s ass. Facebook is about control. SR is about Freedom.<br /><br />We may be part of the Darknet, but we are the opposite, we are the light. Vendors and Buyers alike....The conceptions of what is right is right and wrong is created my humans, by politics, by the whims of society. Whether you are a buyer or seller, you are more important than you realize. Freedom to express one&#039;s self it the greatest gift in the world. Societal stereotypes KISS MY ASS.<br /><br />I hate talking about me but....I must present an example.<br /><br />As you probably already know I want to get the best possible product for my customers. Too often coke is cut with addictive and life ruining substances. Cocaine in its HCL form is relatively harmless...unless you go crazy with it. I want to give the best possible product that I am capable of.&nbsp; It is the same with my weed. I have literally seen the best and worst in the world. I have seen that the concepts of good and evil have been man made. <br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen, <br /><br />I am a well educated man. I have a PH.D&nbsp; I hold a Major in clinical physiology with a minor in social psychology.&nbsp; I was NOT born into wealth nor privilege. I was almost homeless twice.&nbsp; I have slept on bunks in homeless shelters and I have also slept in the best five star hotels. I worked my way up from nothing yet&nbsp; I went from being dependent on society to being a unifying force for the benefit of society. There was a time that I was angry at the world for not giving me what I deserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;I lost my entire family because I became so unified with a cause that everything else became secondary. My Mother and Father are afraid of me because they think/know I am a drug dealer. I have been a drug dealer since I was 18 years old. However, not in the traditional sense. They have said I chose the easy way out&nbsp; my dealing drugs. Anyone who has been in the hustle knows that there is NOTHING easy about dealing. The stress, the time spent waiting to re-up etc.&nbsp; Yet, everything in my being tells me this is my path and I cannot ignore the path I am on. Despite my education...this is all I have ever wanted to do. I understand that drugs can and do destroy lives....but so does alcohol, cigarettes and many other substances. This life is all I have known, with the exception of med school. Med school taught me discipline and hard work. I understand the effects of drugs. I have seen person after person addicted to prescription pills. They ARE worse than illegal drugs. Don&#039;t let anyone tell you different. I saw a person literally mutilate themselves and almost bleed out with a fork because the withdrawals from a variety of prescription pills drove them crazy. Can one man solve all the problems that plague humanity? <br /><br />Finding one&#039;s true occupation is often not simple. Some people fall into a profession at a young age like it has been laid out for them like a red carpet. Every man that has chosen this path truly knows that it is far from the easy way out. My whole adult life I have watched people live normal lives, have normal jobs and live normal lives. I have been bound by a double life. My mother and father have never accepted me for the person I am. I was arrested years ago, for drug dealing.. I was sloppy but I loved it...I would never take it back. Even though I lost my family.<br /><br />Everything in life is a give and take it seems.....<br /><br />Would I take anything back?<br /><br />&nbsp;Not in an instant. BUT.... living a life of invisibility/double life.....it simply takes something from you...your ability to form true relationships is hindered, ultimately you have two choices. <br />1.) remain invisible (which means you can never form true relationships)...Living a lie.<br />2,) Tell your greatest love who you are and risk exposing yourself. (loose lips sink ships) Hoping that person will accept you for who you are.<br /><br />Humble Beginnings:<br /><br />I was not raised with a specific religious framework. Yet i believe in God.&nbsp; I have always been outside the bounds of what is normal. This is what drew me to be one of the biggest contributors to what the dark net is today.<br />Understand that SR is a collective. We are a unified force against what is against us. We do not fight our fellow human being but we simply fight the ignorance and disdain of what people do not understand. Things will change, just as they did with politically motivated movements such as the prohibition. This will take time....BUT things will come around. <br />Friends, Vendors and buyers alike....you are not doing anything wrong. You have been bound by what politicians and society has deemed wrong. Every man should have a choice. I am a physician, I have been with people on their death bed discussing all the things they should have done.&nbsp; Like the SR Motto says: &quot;Stand tall&quot; You are a beacon of light for the oppressed. Drugs are not the issue. The issue is the slow but effective choke hold the government has and will continue to wrap around our necks. <br /><br />DO NOT look at me as a right wing wacko....I have NO political affiliation. I simply evaluate and report. Quite simply...this is the issue. <br />WHERE DOES THE OPPRESSION STOP?<br />1.)Drugs<br />2.)Guns<br />3.)?<br />4.)?<br />5.)?<br /><br />Feel free to fill in the blanks and send back to me....I would appreciate the input.<br /><br />See what I have seen and the possibly of a dystopian society is not so far way.<br /><br />A little more about me....<br /><br />My Coke:<br />Is it expensive for me to buy? YES! but people should have the best....My margins are relatively small but I sleep well knowing that I am not fucking up your brain with weird cut shit. I&#039;m sorry but fuck that and fuck levitimasole. I cannot help what my customers do with my pure product and that is simply how it is. Please people understand that pure product is the way. It is not about quantity but quantity. Pure HCL can allow you to do a small bump and be rolling for hours. <br /><br />My Weed:&nbsp; I get the best locally homegrown weed at a great price. As far as my&nbsp; lower grade...My mexican weed, it is sourced from the best source I can. I cannot guarantee the ingredients, but I offer the best i can. If I detect any harmful components i pull that product.<br /><br />The Future:<br />SR will eventually evolve into a pure drug market where cut product does not need to pollute us anymore. IMO SR was created for a divine purpose....Freedom, choice and the ability to use proper judgement without the government holding our hand...A place where people do not have to go out on the street and buy from scumbags who put god knows what in there as a filler. . . I personally feel that marijuana will be legal very soon.&nbsp; SR is evolving....<br />Just so you know, I do not smoke marijuana. In fact I dont not do any drugs whatsowver.&nbsp; Not because I feel my product is inferior...I have a responsibility. I was built to serve the SR community. I do not allow anything to get in the way. This is what I was built for. I keep my mind straight because i have deviated in the past.&nbsp; <br />I believe I was built to serve. I have lost everything because I have given everything to the darknet... I have lost everything, my family, my friends, even romantic relationships. Despite the dark nights I cannot feel regret. Everything about&nbsp; SilkRoad feels true. Everything about is seems right.&nbsp; I cannot help but feel it is the tip of a very large iceberg.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;SR may collapse...from the pressure of LEO....It would take a massive amount of resources but it is possible... That is not what is important. What IS important is the momentum that has been generated. They can possibly shut down SR, but in its place 10 more will pop up. You can deny a human&nbsp; need but the human spirit can NEVER be underestimated.&nbsp; Historically this has taken place time and time again.<br />It was not until I truly felt purposelessness that I found the strength to identify my true strength and true purpose.&nbsp; Not everyone is ready for SR, most people should never know about it. Many will abuse it just as they do today. I am sorry to drag on....you are probably tired of my ranting....but be vigilant. SR is not just about vendors and buyers.... it is the fact that vendors and buyers can interact...without the help of society...without the help of government and make their voices heard...no matter how muffled they may be right now.&nbsp; <br />Before SR i was living a life most would think is successful and prosperous.&nbsp; a life many people lead. This life was unfulfilling and empty, true relief and healing is blocked by pill popping. An effort that may relieve the symptoms of one&#039;s suffering but provides no true healing. The medical system is broken my friends. <br />My life was filled with so much sadness for a much time before joining SR. Even after joining this community I for some time believed I was contributing to the deterioration of mankind. <br />I hid from myself for so long yet, it was the complete disconnection of who I conceptualized myself as that I recognized that I was living a lie.&nbsp; <br />If you have understood nothing I have written then strive to understand this...Without bad in the world we would not understand the value of good. Without good we would not understand what is evil. <br />My name is Dr. White.&nbsp; I am a drug dealer. My profession is what it is. I have no guilt nor fear only caution.&nbsp; People seek to destroy what they do not understand. I have lost everything as a result of my choices yet I have gained everything.&nbsp; I have seen how others live, and the insight and wisdom cannot be valued....one cannot put a price upon what I have learned.<br />Remember, you are not alone. Remain vigilant, do not hate those who wish to destroy us. Good will always prevail. Remain vigilant. Perhaps the government/media complex is against us but we are the voice of millions, the voice of all those who feel oppressed. We WILL be heard, we have been heard, we will NEVER be silenced.<br />What once started as muffled cries of uncertainty have now become utterances of disdain and distrust towards those we have elected to protect our greater interests. This fact remains regardless of poitical affiliation. <br />I have been with the darknet&nbsp; and SR from its very inception. So it can be said I will act in it&#039;s best interests from the beginning to the end. When I say end...i mean end..I would die for the principles it is based upon...So would my associates.<br />Our enemies have the resources&nbsp; and manpower. However, we have the intelligence and anonymity. DO NOT worry, most of the people working on bringing down SR are now uninterested. They are unmotivated. There are too many of us now. There are a few zealots that are adament. These individuals either 1.) Feel they are doing the right thing 2.) Have something to prove (insecurity). We outnumber them now and their power is waning. Fear has spread throughout LEO. <br />There are those who have been so corrupted by the govenment/media complex that they will do anything they can to compromise their own fellow human being for the sake of a pat on the back and perhaps a promotion.&nbsp; Vendors take a great risk to ensure that the SR gears keep turning. The buyers contribute equally. This train will NOT stop...LEO? if you wanna come after come after somebody...come after me.<br />If you do drugs...I dont give a shit....If you don&#039;t do drugs....I don&#039;t give a shit. I don&#039;t care if you buy from me or not.&nbsp; Will the government stop this war on drugs....perhaps soon, perhaps not for a while. I have lived my life by my own rules, for judgement against one self only brings guilt and misery. Guilt and misery cannot serve you an it cannot serve anyone else. If you are a part of this community, stand tall!.&nbsp; You are giving people the power to choose without outside intervention. If you are a vendor, you are integral. If you are a Buyer, you are integral.&nbsp; The underground is not dead, it is just getting started....<br />God Bless all of you who read these words...Long live the Silk Road.<br />Remain cautious, remain vigilant.<br />Regards,<br />Dr. White

				welcome drwhite.&nbsp; I could not agree with you more. I like tk reflect upon the three quotes I copied below when I start to feel as if I am immoral or doing skmdthing wrong strictly because I am an addict and need a chical to feel happy or cope with life. I have always been one who a<br />mired law emforcement and looked up tl them. as a child i wkuld ask for a cops autograph and belonged to the tj hooker and c.h.i.p.s fan club. it doea indeex bothrr me k owing most law enforcement look at me lime a pos who deserves to have my life taken from me because I have a mental health issues. every addict knows we do jot wake up every day happy and pleasee that we are addicts and use drugs. most of us hate it but what is the alternative? wake up and hate the fact we are alive and be miserable and hate life? its that or take drugs. Why does that make us bad people? <br /><br />when we all see the war on drugs is a failure and how many innocent people die and suffer from violence from real criminals cause these imkral drug laws are in place and keep the cartels in power. These politicNs are educated intelligent people. they do not throw good money after bad. they keep these laws in place cauze they profit from them.&nbsp; who is the criminal here leos?..<br /><br />most leos&nbsp; are sworm to uphold the laws even if they do not agree witb the laws and fear speaking out cause they have families to think of and a pention and value their jobs but there comes a time you have to fave facts. it is the crooked gov officals thay put your life in danger forcing you to uphold these imoral laws so they can get richer. this is why LEAP .&quot;Law enforcement againsy prohibitioN&quot; WAS CREATED.&nbsp; a group of cops..dea agents..federal prosecuters and judges.governers and senators who are against this war on drugs and want all drugs legal and taxed. even president reagens chief drug czar is a member now. tbe same man who came up with the just say no campaign. please dknt be robocops. be human beings who can see right from wrong and imoral from moral and dont judge a person by what goes in his mouth .but judge him by what comes out of his mouth. for what comes out hurts others. what goes in hurts only him or her self. and in the end that is what matters to good people and to the lord. do you hurt others in your pursuit of happiness Nd good people dont hurt anyone. <br /><br />thanks for the good read drwhite.<br /><br />“Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution the time will come when medicine will organize itself into an undercover dictatorship. To restrict the art of healing to doctors and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic.” ― Benjamin Rush 1878<br /><br />Vices are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property. Crimes are those acts by which one man harms the person or property of another. Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others, and no interference with their persons or property. March 1, 1875.<br /><br /><br />A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man&#039;s appetite by legislation, and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes..-Abraham Lincoln,

				Yes, OP is right. I&#039;m only the little Shocky, but even I use the site to sell what I produce. Not drugs, but poetry.<br />But I honestly would not be interested in selling poetry any place else. The Silk Road is a place to buy and sell as you please, which means even my small contribution makes this a better place. <br />This is truly a libertarian section of the world, which for all of history, was impossible until now.<br /><br />Even if Silk Road isn&#039;t here forever, value and treasure it. This place is a gift.

				Preach on Preach on<br /><br />I didn&#039;t even read all that, because from what I did read it sounded like mine own thoughts, so I already basically know everything it says and I&#039;m sure I agree.<br /><br />I will give it a proper read over when I get more time.

				Thank you Dr White. Every word you wrote was necessary. I can relate to your life in many ways, (not the PHD part of course) but the important thing is the content of your message has reenforced my ideals and i will continue to be a beacon of light. I will never turn my back on any SR member as long as they are true and of good intentions. I Have a lot to learn but i see the light, This thing of ours is not meant to be hidden but shared with the ones who want to see the truth and make there own decision. thank you so much. And i know im only one person but I promise to spread the word of the true meaning of what we are really doing here in hopes that all you have sacrificed will not be in vain. thank you again

Supply and demand. Profit and success.<br /><br />The market for drugs is fucking enormous, bigger and more appealing than any other market on the planet that doesn&#039;t involve free money. We want the drugs, they have the drugs, we have the money, the cycle goes on forever with the wheel of time turning on, with or without SR.<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit irritating when socialist/anarchist/whatever types try to dress up dealing drugs and weapons as being some kind of rise-against-the-machine type of thing.<br /><br />When someone is online ordering crack, the last thing on their fucking mind is using their purchase of crack as a weapon against the government.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong Dr White, you seem like a cool dude who&#039;s been through things, but most people really just want some crack. And that&#039;s all there is.<br /><br />Good post though, obviously you&#039;re relatively passionate about getting people high.<br /><br />Respect yo
