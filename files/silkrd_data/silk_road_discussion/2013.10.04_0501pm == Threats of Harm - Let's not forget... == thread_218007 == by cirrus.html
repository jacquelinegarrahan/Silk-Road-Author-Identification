				I know there are a lot of emotions we&#039;re all dealing with right now in light of recent events but we have to remember what we stood for here.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I could say it any better than Libertas&#039;s message: <br /><br />&quot;Dread Pirate Roberts - as a persona - has singlehandedly kept world governments at bay for two and a half years. This idea that this one entity can successfully thwart the phenomenal resources and bloodthirsty power of numerous governments for so long is something that should be taken to heart, and never forgotten. We have the power to fight these agents of oppression, to fight the governments that task them with that oppression, and with the fires that Silk Road has stoked in our hearts and minds we must do just that.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts has shown that free people can engage in consensual free-market transactions for any good or service that they desire without societal or community breakdown, nor the need for enforcement from jackbooted thugs. Silk Road as an experiment has shown that the idea of the free-market is one that works, and works exceptionally well.<br /><br />We must stand on the shoulders of this tragedy that has befallen us and raise high what still remains - our sense of community, freedom and justice. No doubt we will all regroup elsewhere, and I look forward to seeing all of you again, still free and still engaging in free trade without government interference into your personal affairs.&quot;<br /><br />This is who we are and we are better than a mob of vigilantes. Most of you are aware of this and realize how much bigger all this site was than just a place to buy drugs.&nbsp; Until this site breathes no more I&#039;m going to make sure we remain true to what we stood for. <br /><br />I stand with you to the end... your humble servant,<br /><br />Cirrus

Turning to violence will only hurt the progress that&#039;s been made here. It gives the public a way to dismiss us as nothing more than mobsters and common criminals. <br /><br />They tried the whole using violence for progress in the US in the 1970s. It backfired spectacularly; we ended up with the war on drugs and Regan. It&#039;s taken 40 years to start swinging back in the other direction. Learn from that.<br /><br />Violence will only make things worse. Non-violent resistance is a much stronger force for change.

				The last thing we wan&#039;t to do is to take a step backwards. DPR has a special place in my heart for what he has accomplished in the last few years. Killing people, especially feds, is just ridiculous. I firmly believe that DPR would not send messages, especially when talking about killing someone, unencrypted. He is a very smart guy and all the details of this case just wreak of bullshit! I just hope that DPR doesn&#039;t have to spend the rest of his life in jail.

				Forget violence, folks, that could never do any good. Only criminals and criminal organizations, including the FBI, use violence.<br /><br />HOWEVER, a bit of anxiety/stress can be sent their way by doxing and making these &quot;law enforcement agents&quot; (unthinking oppressive goons) realize that the many large-scale dealers they fucked over are royally pissed off and might consider the idea of revenge. It&#039;s extremely unlikely that any of them will, but it&#039;s the IDEA itself that it could happen that serves as revenge. Let their actions have at least SOME repercussion.<br /><br />Perhaps that would force them to stop and think about what they are REALLY doing, in addition to &quot;enforcing the law.&quot;<br />

				The fact that you&#039;re even thinking about threatening feds. What do you think that would get you? You think drug dealers threatening them would make them back off? Threaten them and you get more heat, you&#039;d give them an excuse to go all in. Please, for the sake of everything SR stood for, drop this stupid idea of threatening/scaring feds and move on. Cartels and criminal organizations silence authorities, we stay ahead of them.

The affidavit said they published msgs between him (meaning Stexo?) and DPR that were encrypted? I&#039;d be curious to see this

If anything, antagonizing them is just going to make them more zealous. That&#039;s naive at best. They&#039;re gonna double down if you start going after them thinking you can frighten them into leaving you alone. They may be goons, and they may not be the sharpest tools in the shed, but they&#039;re not retarded. They&#039;ve been pissing off &quot;large scale dealers&quot; for decades; trust me, they&#039;re not losing any sleep over it.<br /><br />The best approach is to move on. We can continue this movement without violence or any other form of aggression/intimidation. That&#039;s how the war on drugs will be won: peacefully. If you really&nbsp; want policy change, then you need popular&nbsp; support.<br /><br />How long have the various mafias been battling the feds for? Where has that gotten them? They don&#039;t seem to have any fears in enforcing the RICO Act.
