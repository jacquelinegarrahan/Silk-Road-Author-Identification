				who can&#039;t connect to SR??? I haven&#039;t been able to in about 3 days...no matter how many times I use a different identity or try reloading the page/opening it in new tabs/ whatever, it ALWAYS times out...Is anyone having the same issue? Or does anyone have any ideas/suggestions of what the hell is going on?

				No your not the only one its been happening to me a lot too, this is what I do and it works, first of all try completely closing all windows inc tor then try and again if this does not work try restarting your comp this normally fix&#039;s things if it does not just be patient and wait 30 mins or so sometimes there is nothing you can do if the site is under maintenance.

				You Windows users have been trained like Pavlov&#039;s dogs to respond to every computer problem by rebooting. :)<br /><br />Rebooting won&#039;t solve a connection problem through the Tor network. This is all you can do:<br /><br />1) Refresh the list of relays<br />2) Get a new identity (build new circuits)<br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t work, the problem is probably not on your end and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />Look in the log file (onion icon -&gt; Message Log). Usually the error message will give you a hint as to what&#039;s wrong. If the error message ends in &quot;try again later&quot;, then the SR server is down or appears to be down. If it says something about waiting too long, then your client has built a circuit to the rendezvous point but the SR server didn&#039;t connect (within some time frame), which is most likely because it is overloaded.

				That&#039;s because it has nothing to do with Windows.<br /><br />I should write a tutorial on troubleshooting common Tor connection problems. It would go something like this...<br /><br />First check if your internet connection sucks in general. If you&#039;re having trouble connecting to clearnet sites, fix your internet connection.<br /><br />If your internet connection is good, look at the error messages. <br /><br />If you see: Closing stream for &#039;[scrubbed].onion&#039;: hidden service is unavailable (try again later).<br /><br />That means the hidden service descriptor isn&#039;t published, which means the server is most likely down. When you see this error message, the connection dies very quickly, in 3-5 seconds.<br /><br />If you see: Tried for [usually 120] seconds to connect to &#039;[scrubbed].onion&#039;. Giving up<br />or anything about an introduction point, a rendezvous point, or rend desc (the rendezvous descriptor)<br /><br />That means either you or the hidden service failed in establishing connections to each other. <br /><br />Read up on how that works: https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en<br /><br />At this point you can refresh the list of relays and get a new identity (build new circuits).<br /><br />If you still get an error along those lines (and/or the error includes words like &quot;waiting&quot; or &quot;timed out&quot;), the hidden service is having problems, either because its internet connection sucks, or because it is overloaded from users, or there may be other reasons, but at that point there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />Try again in a few hours.

People just forget the first steps. You first have to kick your machine, sacrifice a chicken circling it with the fresh blood (virgin maidens are way too hard to find nowadays, and are overrated anyway), then reboot and restart TOR. This 100% proof solution has been posted on the internet since before the dawn of time (ie on usenet)

				Theoretically, if we can access the forums without any problems/lag but keep getting timed out trying to access SR in the same instance of Tor Browser (different tabs), doesn&#039;t that suggest that the problem is on their end? <br /><br />Also, I seem to have better luck in the late hours of the night when fewer people are probably accessing it, maybe it&#039;s overloaded or at its peak or something
