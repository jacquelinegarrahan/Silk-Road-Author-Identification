				Was just wondering what the rules are of selling another vendors product on SR? So for instance re-selling the same gear in another country and naming their name? is this allowed? <br /><br />It would be without the vendors permission, i will not be doing this just wondering whats the rules!<br /><br /><br />thanks.

				I&#039;d be happy to have people buy my products and sell them anywhere they want. Why would anyone mind? It is very important, though, not to &quot;cut the product&quot; or sell other stuff and pretend it is from someone it is not from - while using their name.<br /><br />

				Pretty common for people to buy a vendor&#039;s product and then offer it domestically.&nbsp; Everyone wins.

				Agreed. I buy my UK pills from a guy who imports them from the Netherlands. He risks customs and he makes the profit.

				No harm in this at all. I buy my MDMA from thegreenmachine who imports cloudsurfer&#039;s MDMA into the USA and then sells it at a mark up. I would gladly pay the extra money to not have to deal with those meddling customs agents.

				I buy LL&#039;s MDMA from deadmaufive. I still deal with customs but it&#039;s a great price and it&#039;s actually available in personal amounts. Win for me.

				I don&#039;t know the exact percentage but possibly even a majority on here are resellers. Except for producers everyone is a reseller anyways. People buy my product for $28 a gram and resell it for $75 a gram. I don&#039;t mind, I&#039;m getting the money one way or another.

				Personally if I were to sell a product such as Cocaine and state that it is &#039;XYZ&#039;s Cocaine&#039; I wouldn&#039;t do so without at least having a conversation with them on the subject.<br /><br />Felix
