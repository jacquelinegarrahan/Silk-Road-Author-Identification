				Admins get labor day off? Some idiot who had no intention other then to harm me has revealed my stealth in detail on my feedback.

With support giving the green light to idiots to make purchases to fake address, with the only intention to harm me, or make false claims. Some retard made an order to the middle of a national forrest, and I told him &quot;support might confiscate his funds if he continued to play games.&quot; An hour later support messages me and tells me they don&#039;t give a shit who orders what to where, and if I &quot;intimidate another buyer I will be banned.&quot; I submit a ticket and 17 hours later the feedback that is putting people at risk is still sitting in the exact same place.<br /><br />Sorry for being angry, but its obvious that whoever is running support is playing games.

				Dont forget to cradle the balls!&nbsp; Ya it funny ive been hearing more and more like this, SR just wants the money. They dont care what happens afterwards it seems. But i would suggest to tread lightly and speak to them in a nice manner, if you have to kiss a little ass so be it. Whats the saying, youll attract more flies with honey than with vinegar! You know what i mean, whats crazy is vinegar actually attracts more flies than honey. But you get the jist. Good luck man glad to see someone worried about other peoples interests and safety.<br /><br />OMG! &quot;you can water off a ducks back all you want dude&quot;!! Priceless a real LOL for me +1 buddy you deserve it

				I have to agree with HH on this one. It&#039;s not only his vending that&#039;s being jeopardized but all 18 of the packages he sent out using the same stealth and their freedom. <br /><br />1 hour response on the threat about &quot;SR staff confiscating&quot; but 12+ hours on a feedback post revealing his stealth that is CURRENTLY BEING USED on packages?<br /><br />

				wow i agree that is messed up because that would lead to so many more resolution issues if SR support tells vendors to let the orders be where ever they are asked to go....that is stupid and will really make things a pain in the ass, that bothers me cause dont get me wrong i like that SR&nbsp; support does protect the buyer where it can but the sellers deserve the same protection too because without them the customers would have no reason to be here.....this issue DEF. needs to be looked at and taken seriously that really has me concerned ...i hope they get back to you man

I understand the hatred towards me. But no one deserves to have their freedom put at risk, just so you can sit back and smirk as I fidget.

				Just saying, I think this might be a bit of an overreaction. <br /><br />I agree that it is putting you at risk to reveal your packaging methods, but at the same time it&#039;s not like the dude told everyone the return address on the package that he got from you. I doubt that because your &quot;stealth&quot; has been revealed, that it will have any effect on your other customers. At least I hope so.<br /><br />Regardless, I hope this all gets sorted out and that HH can come up with some better &quot;stealth&quot; methods that will not be revealed in the future.

				I&#039;ll shoot a message over to an admin to look at it, but if you sent the message to vendor support it&#039;s essentially doing the same thing.&nbsp; I still am wondering why if this was such a concern that you would draw even more attention to it here instead of trying to handle it through private messages on the main site?&nbsp; &lt;unsure&gt;

				It&#039;s not the forum admins who perform the vendor support function on the main site.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have any access to such.&nbsp; I hope it all works out for you.&nbsp; Though honestly, if it&#039;s just the feedback currently on your first page of feedback, that&#039;s not very revealing.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty standard method.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure your product probably came packaged in a similar way.&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;m wrong, but I wish you the best either way.
