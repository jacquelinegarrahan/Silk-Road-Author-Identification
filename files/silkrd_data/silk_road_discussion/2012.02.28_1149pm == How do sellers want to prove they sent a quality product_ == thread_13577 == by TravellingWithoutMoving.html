				1. Sellers get DCN for sent packages, which will indicate if the item was delivered. <br /><br />2. Sellers are backed by their reputation and most recent feedbacks.

				They don&#039;t &quot;prove&quot; they sent a quality product. If your products quality is lower than expected then write a review reflecting that, post it on the forums and take your business to a more trustworthy vendor.

				DCN&#039;s would be best wherever possible without tracing back to anyone. Of course you have to check it from somewhere and checking over Tor can flag the package. Wifi at Starbucks or something.....<br /><br />Short of living in Holland how could you ever prove quality? Weight maybe but quality can be subjective anyway.<br /><br />Reputation of both seller and buyer is the best tool. It&#039;s far from foolproof in an anonymous setting but still fairly reliable and the only thing we have without lifting prohibition.<br /><br />So.....say a well known, reputable seller is being accused of slipping a new buyer garbage.<br /><br />Its quite possible for a seller to selectively scam a newbie like that but it can&#039;t happen too many times.<br />The seller will arouse suspicion here if a pattern forms of all newbies making the same complaint.<br />And every newbie who&#039;s legit will only be an unknown for so long. He will establish a rep as a buyer eventually.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s the reverse, a well known, reputable buyer claims the package never showed. <br />Its possible for him to selectively scam but again, how many times before sellers require early finalize, effectively busting him back down to newbie rank?<br /><br />Back before most societies were led to believe they were protected by government agencies......your word was your bond. Your reputation was your most valuable asset.<br /><br />Well, no agencies exist here to &quot;protect&quot; us short of escrow. Buyer (and seller) beware is the rule of the land.<br /><br />In reality, its that way even with, especially with, &quot;government protection&quot;. Look at the failures on their record and the increasing money they throw at a lost cause and the police state it creates.<br />And failures don&#039;t get people fired or ideas scrapped. They just get more funding and more draconian.<br /><br />Buyer (and seller) beware IS the natural law of the land regardless of what anyone says they are doing to &quot;protect&quot; you.
