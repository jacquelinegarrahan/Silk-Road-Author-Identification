				I recently ordered some Blue Defqons from vendor &quot;Schizofreen&quot; and the order has been in processing for 4 days now. He and his listings are all gone. I have made numerous attempts of contacting him via PM&#039;s and still no answer! What should I do at this point? Do I lose all my money if cancelled? Everyone&#039;s input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

				He probably canceled it himself or so. If you can`t find him he`s in stealth mode or no longer a vendor. If you cancel you will get most of your money back.

Then he won`t appear on SR listing, but his vendor profile will be accessible if you remember the url to it. Vendors usually go into stealth mode to avoid detection or when they have run out of items to sell. The fees that goes to SR is what will be charged while the rest will be returned. It depends on the value set by the vendor. There is a list in the &#039;state of the road thread&#039; that explains it.

So I just did a cancel today and I estimate something about 0,4-0,5 bitcoins that go to waste. I guess that&#039;s just the risk you take. I noticed the blue defcons were getting a lot of hype in different circles, so the &#039;sold out&#039; status was a valid possibility. Just sucks cuz I really wanted those pills :-p&nbsp;
