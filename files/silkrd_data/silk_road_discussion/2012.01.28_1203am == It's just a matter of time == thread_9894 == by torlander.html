				In 1770, a large number American colonists were ready to break away from England. At that moment, the town meeting of Boston chose John Adams to serve in their cause. Adams accepted, but had to face the consequences: He was about to stand up to the King of England and defy him. Being chased and imprisoned was expected. Death was a distinct possibility. Then, he had to go home and tell the wife. This is his account of that night:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When I went home to my family in May, 1770, from the town meeting in Boston, which was the first I had ever attended, and where I had been chosen in my absence, without any solicitation, one of their representatives, I said to my wife, &quot;I have accepted a seat in the House of Representatives, and thereby have consented to my own ruin, to your ruin, and to the ruin of our children. I give you this warning, that you may prepare your mind for your fate.&quot; She burst into tears, but instantly cried out in a transport of magnanimity, &quot;Well, I am willing in this cause to run all risks with you, and be ruined with you, if you are ruined.&quot; These were times, my friend, in Boston, which tried women&#039;s souls as well as men&#039;s.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Shit is always hitting the fan. The Silk Road was started because SHIT IS HITTING THE FAN. Governments around the world steal from their citizens, imprison, and execute them over fake crimes invented by the legislature. Shit always hits the fan— it&#039;s what you do when shit hits the fan that shows who you are. John Adams made his decision, and the Silk Road admins made theirs.

				all crime is fake. It&#039;s all a human creation. Even murder. Animals may not murder each other for fun (for the most part, but look up homicidal african elephants) but they will if they are competing for survival. NOT SAYING MURDER IS RIGHT. Just pointing out that law, and it&#039;s basis on morality, is completely fake. <br /><br />And no, he&#039;s trying to compare us standing up for SR and our rights to the Revolutionary War. Although, it really is applicable, after all, who do you think wrote the 2nd amendment?<br /><br />But i am anti-gun on sr, there are other markets for those tthat wish them, on TOR even.
