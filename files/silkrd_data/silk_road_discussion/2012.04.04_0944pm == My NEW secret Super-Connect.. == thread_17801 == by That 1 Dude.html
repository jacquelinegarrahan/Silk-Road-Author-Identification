				It is not the same in my case.. for now at least. <br /><br />A few dealers have heard about it, like its some urban legend, but are far from computer savvy enough to find a way here. Tho some customers would surely be creating accounts in no time if they found out they could cut me (the middleman) out.<br /><br />So for now SR will be my nameless mega-connect. that somtimes takes the shape of your friendly neighborhood postal worker&nbsp; ;)

				same boat here I dont sell from SR purchases but no one I know has heard about SR nor do I think will they ever hear about it, I see it strange how some people can think so lightly of it when anyone that isnt supposed to hear about it does would go batshit over something like it, <br /><br />SR is still a fairly small venue 200,000 globally is like the smallest blip it is still a secret in my eyes

Personally, I can&#039;t imagine anyone asking me where I got my product from, but I only deal with certain types of people. The other types are cut off quickly if they show certain behaviors, one of which are too many questions.

				I told my girlfriend and roommate about SR when i found it. I also told two close friends. One didn&#039;t really seem to care and another took a bit of interest. My friends do other drugs but not at the level of interest and commitment that i do i guess. <br /><br />I plan on selling some of the stuff i get on here, and I&#039;ve told some people the same thing you did. &quot;I know a guy bringing some good shard in and he gets it from Holland&quot;<br /><br />I have a test kit and have always sold nothing but good MDMA so even if people don&#039; t believe its coming from EU most ppl are confident that if im selling it, it&#039;ll be worth buying<br /><br /><br />As someone else said, I&#039;m a firm believe in loose lips sink ships. <br />So lets keep the masses away from this. History has shown us things like this going mainstream does not go good in the long run..

				keeping users at bay are going to be difficult, personally I will never say a word to friends but the sites growth shows no lie, in the 7-8 months SR has been alive in 2011 there were 9000 users, its been just barely 4 months into 2012 and we have about 8500 and counting, numbers do not lie SR is definitely getting bigger but I guess I am going to be selfish and keep it for myself :)

				I&#039;ve told a few people, but these are people that also do drugs themselves and some to a higher degree than I do. The 4 I have told are all educated, street smart, have families, and legitimate incomes to where spending a few hundred bucks a month is not jeopardizing putting food on the table. Now that I myself have a family and stable, producing career I no longer am interested in driving down to visit with any of my old connects, many who are in shitty parts of town and having to carry a gun to buy pills, x and weed when I actually used to smoke it is no longer a rush to me. The security that is provided in buying this way is undeniable, and I find it utterly fascinating that the forums here are so supporting and civil. <br /><br />I care deeply about my friends and their families and see telling them about SR as sort of a moral obligation in that I am exposing them to what I consider a very secure way to still partake in things they enjoy doing. <br /><br />Just a few reasons why I appreciate this place.

				I discovered SR after reading the Rolling Stone article, standing around killing time at a Walmart. How many people do you think read that the same way I did? I think a whole bunch did. The article just explained that one needs Tor to access it. So I searched Silk Road on Wikipedia and I found a detailed page outlining everything about it. Downloaded the Tor bundle installed that bitch typed in the url Wikipedia gave me. Here I am.

				Well, when I was coming through with DMT, oil, and other various cannabis concentrates, and sharing them with my brother, he got a hunch I was getting it outsourced because almost nobody deals with that type of stuff locally. SR is definitely something I keep very secretive, simply because of the mantra, &quot;loose lips sink ships&quot;. No one had to tell me about SR, I found it out on my own. If people are computer savvy enough and do some very slight digging on the clearnet, they can easily figure out how to get on SR as well.

				I would never tell anyone about SR, partly because I don&#039;t want to share my connects/business advantages and partly because people in my area just don&#039;t get the whole &quot;you can buy drugs on the net easier and safer than from some hood-rat on the street&quot;. They don&#039;t believe it because they are too close minded to believe it. The &quot;we know best&quot; mentality defeats them. <br /><br />

				I simply tell them the global origin of the product and what is known about it from my own lab analyses, there is simply no need to explain further.&nbsp; When people ask uncomfortable questions, simply tell them you don&#039;t want to answer.&nbsp; If they ask a *lot* of uncomfortable questions, it may be time to evaluate your trusted circle.

				I first heard about it about a year ago, kind of like an urban legend thing. Some guy at a party mentioned to me that there was this thing called the Silk Road where you could get any drug you wanted, but he didn&#039;t have the details. Computer geek that I am, I researched thinking it was just bullshit, and here I came. I usually don&#039;t tell people that I use SR. What I usually tell people that I only kind of know is that I just have this one awesome dealer in my city who &quot;places orders&quot; internationally. I tell them that he&#039;s in the black market and they get all excited and shit haha. So that&#039;s how I explain why it takes me a while to get their shit too, I tell them my dealer places orders. So basically the same system as SR but I don&#039;t tell them everything.<br /><br />Except every time I use MDMA with a group of people, I end up telling them where I got it because I just love everyone too much to keep any secrets ;D

				I&#039;ve told more than a few people that I know won&#039;t go all gonzo and create any problems - SR is just too cool to keep it a COMPLETE secret. And I&#039;ve done a group buy with a couple of them. I just feel that nothing I say nor anyone I say it to in my circles of friends and colleagues will make any difference to this wondrous place. Besides, once I explain all the conniptions you have to go through in order to buy here (Tor, BCs, PGP, etc.) not one person is interested in following up themselves.

				I&#039;ve mentioned it to a few friends. Most think I&#039;m crazy (there correct of course) the others find the learning curve to much to handle. and then there&#039;s those silly folks that don&#039;t want to risk incarceration (That&#039;s me also)&nbsp; <br />I said i was crazy though....can&#039;t help myself, plus i love the community. What can i say &quot;birds of a feather flock together.....peace

				Indeed. I don&#039;t think any of my friends would nut up and place an order. <br /><br />Yet here in this one place there are so many like minded, brazen, pioneers of the drug trade. I salute you!

				Yes.. Dazzled Newbie indeed. I just hope by the time I am a seasoned SR veteran I am not putting down excited happy people in their own threads. Tho I am sure one day my orders will become a secondary thought and just part of my every day average life. But for now I am going to be pumped up about this great new adventure in my life. <br /><br />

				It may be greedy (or subconsciously caring- I have a few friends who enjoy the occasional opiate) of me, but I don&#039;t tell my friends about this place. Instead, I get my stuff from &quot;my guy&quot; named Eric. He travels hundreds of miles, from parts of Canada all the way down to Florida, to peddle his wares. Sometimes he&#039;ll have MDMA when he visits my town, sometimes psychedelics... The lie grows more and more elaborate each time someone asks.

				I told my one friend and instantly everyone knew. One thing, they&#039;re all to retarded to be capable of using this consistently. Plus, they&#039;re far too greedy to every finalize early. Growing up as a nobody, I learned to let go of my ego and to sometimes say &quot;fuck it.&quot; <br /><br />Egotistical, common dealers are not capable of letting go of themselves and thus would never finalize early or even know WTF GPG even is. <br /><br />I think the biggest roadblock though for sheeple/randoms is buying BTC. The whole idea of economics and essentially money laundering is FAR too complex for normal randoms. My point is simply that these common idiots just don&#039;t fucking get it, and won&#039;t get it unless you hold their hand. Besides being computer savvy is totally &quot;lame and nerdy.&quot; All power to us!

				Its funny... Before I got my first bitcoin I mention to a friend we could do a group buy on a HP and get a deal..<br />I tell him its off a site.. he instantly says &quot;oh yeah silkroad?&quot; He says he found it and quit when it became to tough to join..<br /><br />Now I&#039;m stocked with the rarest/best shit in town.. and he&#039;s on to me.. <br /><br />He&#039;s a great dude, good dealer, and what I fear will be my new biggest competition.. <br /><br />The plate is big. We all can eat. But we know the same people and It just gets weird. So I say treat SR like you would any GREAT connection.. ON THE LOW! I fear the public eye for so many reasons, but honestly it boils down to this.. I love my friends.. I love this site.. but If they see me get non stop on point delivery, each time they get more and more comfortable with the idea of mail man/dope man. <br /><br />This outlook will change with different people and different people&#039;s goals. I want to make money, and free drugs for myself.. That IS THE ONLY reason I risk my freedom. Friends who buy from time after time will soon want the SR price.. I just should have kept my cards closer, Now its stricktly a guy named ______ that moves from coast to coast picking up this and that.
