				Hey folks, check the top-sticky in the rumormill section, it should have some info about reporting these guys. :)<br /><br />Also, toss a donation to microRNA and moksha for their work as spambusters. The reason you don&#039;t see an even worse flood of this shit is because those two, and the other mods as well, keep a tight lid on it most of the time. Unfortunately, they can&#039;t be around at all hours.
