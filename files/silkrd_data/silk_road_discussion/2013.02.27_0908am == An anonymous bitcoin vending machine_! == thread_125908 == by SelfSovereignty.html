				Somebody on the forums here had this idea recently and asked for comments on it... Seems someone beat him to it: http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57570925-38/need-bitcoins-this-atm-takes-dollars-and-funds-your-account/

				Hopefully for the purpose of anonymity and convenience bitcoin vending machines get implemented this year. The machine that dude made is tiny though. Seems like someone could easily nick it

				People would freak out thinking there is a camera on them or inside the machine, the LE would somehow fuck things up eventually, it would have a good run but it would end up with people freaking right out. Cant see it ever taking off.

				I love the idea but I just don&#039;t see it as economical at this point.<br /><br />$1k to $1.5k for the machine. What business owner aside from one of the bitcointalk nutters would buy this?<br />It&#039;s such a niche product. Very few locations would get more than nil use. <br /><br />It&#039;ll have it&#039;s day I just don&#039;t think that day will be for a few years.<br />

				Seems like a good idea to me, however, it would unfortunately take a large amount of time for them to be distributed widely enough for it to be a viable option for most people. :/&nbsp;
