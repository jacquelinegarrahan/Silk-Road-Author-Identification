				I hate the search function on Silkroad, if I for example<br />where to search for amanita. It will search up everything<br />that contains the the letters a-m-a-n-i-t-a.<br /><br />And putting it in quotes &quot;amanita&quot; doesn&#039;t help either.<br /><br />Damn stupid search function if you ask me.<br /><br /><br />--<br />Mr.T <br />

				+1 man. I can&#039;t stand it either. If it isn&#039;t telling me I&#039;ve searched within the last 5 seconds then it gives results back that are far too broad or it only lists the first 30 results for a term excluding multiple pages of results in the process.<br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t hate the player, hate the team.&quot;

				Yah the forum search pretty much sucks.&nbsp; Most inconsistent search ever.&nbsp; Different results from minute to minute and very little flexibility to find what you want.

				I agree something needs to be done about the search function... But does anyone have any ideas? set them out on the table so we can discuss them :). There are many things that I love about the silkroad and one of them is for the most part they listen to the threads about trying to improve the site(could have been put in the Technical support section but that&#039;s not that big of a deal).

				Absolutely terrible!<br /><br />And I mean that unapologetically. <br /><br />No reason you have a place where you help facilitate every single product having to do with whatever you want to feel good and you have a lousy search function.<br /><br />Whether clearnet or darknet, a sucky search function COSTS money, not makes it.<br /><br />I hope those that have the power to control this, understand it.

				I&#039;ve mostly adapted to going through heaps of irrelevant search results to get to the few I&#039;m actually after, or else abandoning searches altogether, but it does still annoy me that you can&#039;t run any kind of advanced search whatsoever - no boolean connectors, nothing. If you want to find posts on MDMA preloading, you&#039;re either gonna search through a thousand MDMA threads or a thousand preloading threads, or both, because we can&#039;t have people searching for &quot;MDMA preloading&quot;. Ugh.<br /><br />And I can&#039;t help but wonder if the huge number of people who start threads on topics that have been started a hundred times before are at least *partly* due to the known crapitude of the search feature.

				I&#039;m posting this on behalf of gwern, who is still stuck in the newbie forums: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176844.msg1270250#msg1270250">Quote from: gwern on June 24, 2013, 06:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I agree. The search is *awful*. Here is a real example: I was searching for the user &quot;Truckin&quot;, which turns up nothing. I discover the actual user name is &quot;-Truckin-&quot;; ok, that&#039;s a seriously crappy search because &#039;Truckin&#039; is obviously a substring of &#039;-Truckin-&#039;. But whatever; I search for &#039;-Truckin-&#039; - *zero* hits. The user has 30 posts! WTF?!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And back to me: <br /><br />I don&#039;t think the SR team would need to code anything to make improvements: these forums are basic Simple Machines software. Perhaps it would be possible for the admins to enable the &quot;Advanced Search&quot; features, or to at least try adjusting some of the settings. Unless they&#039;re worried it would slow performance heavily it couldn&#039;t hurt to try. <br /><br />One note: when you&#039;re searching, make sure you&#039;re searching from the MAIN SR FORUMS PAGE. If you search from within a thread or board, you&#039;ll get results only from that thread or board. If you return to the front page of the forum you&#039;ll get results from the whole site.

				Yes the vendor search function can be frustrating as well and that should be one of the most functional pieces here.&nbsp; For people wanting to make buys they come here and put in the vendors name to see of any ongoing scandals.&nbsp; Often the rumor mill section is getting quickly posted in and old posts dropped to the bottom swiftly so being able to use the search to find a week or few day old thread or post is important.<br /><br />People are always instructing newbies to make sure they do this but it is sometimes nearly impossible with the current search.&nbsp; We should be able to search for any unique part of a vendors name and be shown all of the results pertaining to that vendor - and these searches should be case insensitive.
