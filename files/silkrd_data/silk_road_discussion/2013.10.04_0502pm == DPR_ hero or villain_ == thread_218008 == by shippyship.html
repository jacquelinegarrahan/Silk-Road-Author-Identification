Of a fictitious man with a fictitious wife and kids (although that aspect was unbeknownst to DPR). Also keep in mind this is the 2nd time DPR unsuccessfully solicited a M4H. I fully support his claimed ideology, but I don&#039;t think he truly did; he just pushed it on you all to make a cool $80 million while laughing all the way to the bank. <br /><br />Had the aforementioned aspects not been part of the arrest warrant, I would consider him a martyr for the good fight; I just can&#039;t justify that position now, and I don&#039;t understand why an overwhelming majority of the Road holds him in God-like status. The grim reality is that all he did was amalgamate his skills to fill a niche market void that ultimately lead to his downfall due to carelessness.<br /><br />This was originally going to be a response to a soon-to-be-dead thread, I am quoting Cirrus (a moderator) who was wildly accused of being LEO for correctly not providing details on the primary agent responsible for the Road&#039;s demise. Then I decided I wanted some community feedback on my opinion. Am I off-base or on-point? You decide.

				Without the killer hiring he would be a hero. We don&#039;t know how hard the FBI agents tried to make him do this however. He may have been manipulated by them all along and we only see the part which makes him look bad. Anyway, that&#039;s no excuse for murder. <br /><br />In a country like the USA it&#039;s not a surprise however, as they are constantly killing people in other countries, and those people are not always bad guys. So many people there think they&#039;re some kind of cowboy in the wild west.<br />

				@dread, I guess the definition of aggression is subjective. Are you making the statement in a roundabout way that: murder for theft is in-line with Libertarian ideology?<br /><br />@Bazille, I don&#039;t have the first hit details in my head (nor if they were mentioned in the arrest warrant by anyone other than DPR to redandwhite) but the 2nd attempted hit of the family man appeared as those DPR sought the debtor of FriendlyChemist with the intention of having FC wiped out.

I&#039;m taking my &quot;accusations&quot; directly from the arrest warrant, not the media. Time will tell if those accusations are legitimate, but there is no reason to believe otherwise.

				Nobody says I&#039;m a criminal. As some black guy in the 90s or 2000s put it &quot;It ain&#039;t considered a crime unless they catch you.&quot;<br /><br />Other than freedom fighting fuck-the-system conjecture and speculation, I don&#039;t think anything in the arrest warrant has been proven false as of yet. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty of public evidence available to circumstantially substantiate quite a bit of it as well. I give credence to the arrest warrant allegations not because I believe the gov&#039;t is honest, but because misrepresentation of facts in that could be substantial enough to have the case thrown out. It&#039;s more likely to be accurate for self-serving reasons rather than selfless dedication to stellar investigative work.<br /><br />As far as the Muslim thing goes, they deserve it. If the FBI / DHS / CIA can set them up to a point where they agree to engage in terrorist activities, it would be even easier for a genuine AlahuAcchchchcbar terrorist to get them to join their cause. I&#039;m fully supportive of nixing potential future terrorists.<br /><br />What we know as fact is that DPR is being independently charged in Maryland for soliciting murder for hire, exclusive of the federal charges. There has to be pretty credible evidence to indict someone on such serious charges. <br /><br />If you fail to acknowledge my points, you are a sheep blindly following your beloved leader, because he made you believe he believes in the same things you believe in.

				shippyship,<br /><br />So if the charges are &quot;serious&quot; enough, you&#039;ll automatically believe it?<br /><br />Misrepresentation of facts is far from the only tactic that is employed by the IC. You don&#039;t know who we are talking about here. The criminal organization(s) we are talking about are very good at creating legends, make-believe scenarios, planted evidence trails, unverifiable claims, etc.<br /><br />DPR is no more a &quot;beloved leader&quot; to me than the FBI are a &quot;beloved law enforcement agency&quot; to you. Let&#039;s leave the ad hominems out.<br /><br />All I&#039;m saying is that you are giving undeserved credibility and authority to the very same goons that wouldn&#039;t hesitate to break into your house and arrest you and steal from you if they so much as suspect that you have a stash of weed.<br />

				We have no reason not to believe the charges. What part of the arrest warrant do you specifically discredit? Everyone here knows DPR was the sole proprietor of SR, everyone here knows what SR is all about. A majority of the warrant we can corroborate due to our knowledge of SR, we can&#039;t conclusively tie them to RWU, but they certainly did a solid job of connecting the dots. Are you simply claiming that the murder for hire aspect was fabricated because that doesn&#039;t fit the image of DPR you hold so dearly? I&#039;ll readily admit some of it may not be true (inaccuracies / misinformation), but with such a high profile case they have a lot more to lose via fabrication than they have to gain.<br /><br />I&#039;m no more a fan of the po-lice than you are, but I&#039;m also not a fan of psuedoLibertarians who let greed get the best of them and lost sight of what this was supposed to be all about in the first place, while putting hundreds of vendors and thousands of large scale buyers in jeopardy as the result of carelessness.

				DPR had the greatest of intentions if he did indeed choose to have someone assassinated.<br />It was for the benefit of the whole community , not himself.<br />The target had a number of users and vendors details. Imagine all the years in prison they would serve, the families it would ruin.<br />&nbsp;He was doing what he thought was best and I stand by his decision, although his choice of assassin was regrettably poor.<br />Just because the leader is gone , this war against oppression and free market will go on.

				for starters i&#039;m gonna point out that i have been on the wrong end of a fucked up accusation by LE on more than one occasion. that together with the crap i hear from politicians and the media on a daily basis means i no longer have faith or believe anything the feds or the govt say anymore. and i mean to the point that i wouldn&#039;t even be surprised if osama bin laden was innocent. i mean how many times do we have to witness their law be total bullshit before we start waking up to the fact they will do anything, say anything and even charge people with anything if it suits their agenda?<br /><br />secondly i say to all the non violent, peaceful protest types, that i respect what you are all trying to achieve, and i wish i could be 100% behind you. but sometimes there does come a time when violence is necessary. not that i advocate the types who use it willy nilly to serve their own personal interests, but there does come a time when there is no other way, you just gotta do what you gotta do sometimes. that&#039;s the reality of life.<br /><br />i&#039;m certainly not gonna judge dpr on what its been said he might have done. especially considering who it is that&#039;s saying it. and even if he did, well i&#039;ve not been in his position anyway, so i&#039;m still not one to judge.

				I&#039;m not pretending to know what *actually* went down, but from what has been detailed... DPR did not know whether the admin was a rat or not, it was conscious speculation on DPR&#039;s part. Maybe he thought &quot;Hey, this guy&#039;s been disloyal already by stealing bitcoin from me, so why wouldn&#039;t he rat on me?&quot; It&#039;s certainly logical, although the timing raises some questions. One would assume this admin to be one of DPR&#039;s most loyal contacts, given the fact that he organised the deal through him and that this admin had enough information to threaten Silk Road. He must have found out about the bitcoin theft almost simultaneously to the arrest. The FBI would not know about the stolen bitcoin... So I guess they just got *really* lucky that he found out *right then*, and then ordered a hit through the exact person he should be suspicious off. Something seems a bit off to me there, but who knows?<br /><br />Something else to remember is that this person was arrested (and their life ruined), based on what we know, because of DPR&#039;s willingness to trust strangers on the dark web. Further, the murder-for-hire element to this story is going to paint an incredibly typical (of criminal enterprise) image to the world, an image we know not to be true, and one that DPR actively fought against. Silk Road was supposed to eliminate violence from the drug world, if only in this small microcosm. We all believed it had done that. Not quite, apparently.<br /><br />I sympathise with DPR because he seems like a nice guy who got in over his head. But once you start making mistakes, and then trying to kill the victims of those mistakes because you think they might talk about your mistakes... Not cool. One good effect of this is that it&#039;s quelled the oftentimes cult-like reverence of the guy, when clearly it was his work (and not him) that was so laudable. I thank him for creating a model that people will no doubt continue to follow.

No jury. Just a big fat bomb.<br /><br />Now here&#039;s your homework kids: write an essay explaining the difference between Obama using a drone to protect his people versus DPR using an assassin to protect his people. Anyone who writes more than 500 words on it without just writing gibberish gets an A.

				DPR is a hero.<br /><br />What about the assassinations, you say?<br /><br />Well, you&#039;ve got to crack a few eggs to make an omelette.<br /><br />You can&#039;t have a revolution without spilling some blood.
