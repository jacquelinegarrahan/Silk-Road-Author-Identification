				it keeps me up at night.. thats why i want to spend on drugs now and not have a break.<br /><br />if it ever goes down perhaps one day a high group in the Los Zetas drug cartel opens a web hosting company and future tor websites specialising in drug dealing can be hosted from that as i figure they are about the most untouchable kinds of people the US knows about but cant do much about

				If I had to speculate how long it would take for the U.S. government to be able to shut down SR, I&#039;d say forever. TOR sites are outside of U.S. jurisdiction, so Senator Schumer is more than welcome to cry to Michele Leonhart and Eric Holder all he wants. Of the $60 billion or so of annual drugs sales in the U.S. the DEA stops about 1% of those sales. Barry and Joe are far more concerned with turning the heat on legit dispensaries complying with state law. More than likely they&#039;ll just camp some LEO here and use it as a honeypot to snare large scale operations. Trying to take on Silk Road is like fighting a Hydra without a torch. Farmer&#039;s Market got busted because they were stupid enough to let people pay with easily traceable methods like paypal. Likely the only reason the investigation took two years was because they wanted to ensure they got as many worthwhile busts out of it as they could. Saying Silk Road is similar to Farmer&#039;s Market is like saying a Corvette and a Cavalier are similar, they might be in the same general category since they&#039;re both made by Chevy, but you definitely wouldn&#039;t put money on the Cavalier in a race.

				If the gov&#039;t has the power to take down SR, not having SR would be the least of my worries.&nbsp; even if they did, BMR would be right there to take over and I&#039;m sure others would sprout up.&nbsp; people are even working on decentralizing the creation of darknet markets, I think the project is called BitWasp.&nbsp; also think of how long it took them to catch (execute) Bin Laden (assuming they were trying the whole time)&nbsp; - who knows how hard they are actually trying to take down SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />For all the people scoff that the idea that the feds are helpless to stop us all-powerful darknet drug users, I think that is a reckless attitude - plan for the worst, hope for the best. The US gov&#039;t is a formitable enemy to say the least, with enough money there isn&#039;t much that can&#039;t be done - good thing they are out of money and soon won&#039;t be able to print or borrow more either :)<br /><br />I think bitcoin is much more threatening to the powers that be, at a much more fundamental level.&nbsp; compared to bitcoin&#039;s potential threat, SR is nothing.

				The only reason they would want to take down SR is because it is in competition with their own business model.<br /><br />The federal gov in the US is bringing the drugs in and making tons off of it.&nbsp; If SR starts to in any way cut into their<br />business and they are not profiting, that is when you will see SR go down.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the US it is a winning proposition.&nbsp; They bring in the drugs and make $ from its sale.&nbsp; Then they lock up the &quot;criminals&quot;<br />in their private prisons and make money from that.&nbsp; If they could make as much money from drugs being legal, then the drugs would be legal.<br />It is all basic economics.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Put the pitch forks and torches away.<br /><br />OP is right, it will be by conventional means that SR eventually goes down -- human intelligence.<br />Doesn&#039;t matter that they can&#039;t find the server by technological means. This whole operation is only as secure as its weakest link.<br /><br />And besides the ex-girlfriend factor, how in the fuck do you think DPR is cashing out over $2.2 million a month in BTC? He can&#039;t. The total monetary base of bitcoin is around $120m. <br />NO bitcoin business other than Mt. Gox pulls in revenue like this.<br /><br />He&#039;ll get caught for money laundering or he&#039;ll get ratted out.<br />He&#039;s no dummy so I presume he&#039;s just banking all that BTC in an offline wallet and making big plans to buy an island someday far in the future, when the bitcoin economy has some actual size.<br />And for what it&#039;s worth DPR, I do hope you make it to that island. I&#039;d like to have a pina colada with you someday :)

				There is no reason to speculate on who will win in the contest between SR and the State. Thanks to DPR the experiment is underway and we will all find out eventually. SR and bitcoin are an experiment in using technology to return some privacy to the individual. Privacy that has been eroded by the very same technology that now allows the government to track every penny you earn and everything you do with your body.&nbsp; The US government is going to expend allot of resources to shut SR down , not because of the money or drugs involved , but mostly because the existence of a place like this is a challenge to their authority. Even if SR does get shut down - if the vendors escape punishment it will be a validation of the model under which SR operates and there will surely be other sites popping up to replace it.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been away for two days and when I come back someone has posted this Jesus thing in capital letters (DON&quot;T DO DRUGS, I LOVE YOU, SAVE YOUR SOUL, SR IS DOOOOOOMED!!!!!!! and so forth) and now this. Did anyone miss me btw? Probably not. This is my first post so I haven&#039;t even checked this Jesus thing yet, I will find it and give him a piece of my mind.<br /><br />Soooooo........<br /><br />quote author=chasezip2201 link=topic=93486.msg659905#msg659905 date=1355470030]<br />Anyways, whats your estimate especially with the growing popularity only more and more attention will fall on it.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be long before we see CBS reporting about this &quot;guy who overdosed on whatever bought from the mysterious underground website SR run by the most dangerous criminals&quot; ect.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />[/quote]<br /><br />This has already happened pmsl with Ryan West. SR is still running. Not to mention that crackpot Fiona West stirring up trouble with her tabloid-style rant on how &quot;easy&quot; it was to stockpile guns from BMR. BMR is still running. SR is definitely on LE radar and in time they will get more effective in engaging with SR, but at the moment I think it&#039;s more likely to be attacks on servers, malware from LE vendors in the Electronics dept. (only buy from trusted vendors like deeo/NQA etc), overloading the site, and attempts at hacking into well known vendors&#039; accounts like has just happened at BMR. It has occurred to me that this BTC spammer on the forums is LE. This is the sort of problems we can expect, nothing major just yet. (It&#039;s possible they are testing the security on the forums.)<br /><br />Hasselhoff hit nail on head. If LE can shut down SR it will represent they have the ability to attack Tor network. The AFP is going after bikies because new legislation supposedly created to deal with them is also deliberately worded in terms that allow LE to go after anybody they don&#039;t like, including civilians with no connection to the underworld. Same logic applies to SR. (Unlike the drivel that conspiracy theorist journalists are spouting, there&#039;s nothing seedy about the underweb.) I wonder if we turned the tables and hacked into police DBs would they be offended by that.<br /><br />Another thing, LE is more likely to play games like alleging that they have &quot;caught&quot; DPR, and kre-8 a temporary drop-off in orders as everyone panics and doesn&#039;t know which vendors&#039; accounts have been compromised. And monitoring the resulting chatter, not to mention spikes to specified destination urls or TorMail addresses. Oooooh that&#039;s right, they can&#039;t even do that. Welcome to TheOnionRouter, assholes.<br /><br />btw, what chOsen said, I&#039;ve been saying for years. It&#039;s well known LEs put drugs back into circulation again, in AU and in U.S. It&#039;s the perfect business, as they harvest drugs for free and then sell what&#039;s not theirs to begin with, right under the nose of the public. <br /><br />Bottom line, SR can expect attacks by LE but if everyone uses a bit of common sense they&#039;re currently quite limited in what they can. At least currently. So at moment, keep buying and selling, just don&#039;t use your real name (even though a lot of people say use your real name and address to avoid it being marked as undeliverable), consider mail drops and don&#039;t go blabbing about it to your gf for godsakes. Only problem I have is when people don&#039;t use their real nics, like the OP for this thread. It sends a red flag. Apart from that, everyone take a goddamn chill pill, and get back to doing whatever it is that rocks your boat, drive safely, don&#039;t forget to eat. Piece out ya bastards ;)<br /><br />btw, congrats typtap on becoming Hero Member. Ya bastard ;)

				Even if something did happen anytime soon (Which is unlikely) I&#039;m sure there would be another one starting up in its place. I personally would help any way I could and I think most if not all SR would agree. The government can go fuck themselves. Were not hurting anyone. It reminds me of the picture of the guy holding the sign that says gun sellers are accomplices to crimes and the guy next to him is holding a sign that says spoons made me fat. Besides that the government has already made numerous attempts to shut it down. All of which didn&#039;t even phase SR.

Nobody dissociates from someone because they pirate movies occasionally. But if that person occasionally drops acid, or occasionally does meth or MDMA or god forbid RC&#039;s or heroin, I&#039;d bet a good half of the people you talk to offhand would refuse to further your relationship past anything more than acquaintance level. That&#039;s the sad reality of it; the public, indoctrinated as it is, believes drugs to be a REAL threat, not something intangible like piracy. Drug addiction has real effects on people and they don&#039;t understand that legalization and education on the dangers and merits of different drugs is the only way to truly combat dangerous drug addiction. It is going to be a very long time for that to get through the skulls of the centrist-conservative-leaning majority in the USA. That&#039;s just the way things are.<br /><br />Which brings back what someone said about television; if it WAS found out that some teenager who had everything going for them OD&#039;d on some drug they got from SR, and the media publicized it, I have no doubt that there would be media backlash enough to warrant a major investigation. Whether that would amount to anything, I don&#039;t know. But the power of the people seems to be severely underestimated in this thread. Everyone&#039;s talking about how the goverment is either this giant evil mass of conglomerate power or some sort of dying shell of a former self, but no one is mentioning the real power that the media can have in this issue, and how easily it would be to spin the public opinion and therefore change what the government can and will do.<br /><br />Think about it: what MAJOR power is going to stop the government of any nation from seeking to destroy SR? I doubt that any government will understand that the nature of this site is truly benevolent. What will happen if the government shuts it down? There might be some scuffles between nations remarking upon the idea that any one government can control the endless recesses of the darknet. But will wars erupt? will people die for this? I doubt it. The world will eventually go back to normal. <br /><br />That being said, I think that it would be extremely hard for any force to do any reasonable damage to SR, the foundation is relatively sound given what it is accomplishing. But can they make it hard to run this operation? I think so. Will they? I don&#039;t think anybody knows for sure. But like people have said, people who are saying that there&#039;s no way it could happen are living in a dream-world. I don&#039;t think anybody can guarantee anything in this regard, for sure.

				The rash of &#039;The end of the world[SR] is nigh&#039; is due to the onset of Xmas. The prophets have been sent by the keepers of the &quot;Faith&#039;&#039; , that amazing super human ability to believe something, when every bit of reason, intelligence, intuition science even, sais it aint so.

With maybe the exception of NPR or some independent presses, there will be a general concordance of &quot;this is evil and must be stopped&quot; AS SOON as it&#039;s found that a teenager&nbsp; has died. One thing I&#039;m debating is whether or not a death as a result of research chemicals or a death as a result of some of the &#039;harder drugs&#039; like meth or heroin will cause the most media focus. On one hand, the media can report that &#039;dangerous, untested drugs&#039; are being sold offhand to children &#039;with no system in place to stop it&#039;, because it&#039;s not like the mass media gives a fuck about genuine reporting. On another hand, they could cite some bullshit claim about the resurgence of heroin in the United States as causal of an increased popularity of SR, or of the inevitability of another rise in methamphetamine use due to mass dealing on SR. <br /><br />None of them are pretty for the state of things, but there are a few things that I think we can be sure of: <br /><br />1 . Nobody will EVER be able to stop the smuggling of drugs through the mail. Smuggling has existed since even the notion of prohibited merchandise has been around. If SR is put to pasture, it would be rough, but there would be no way for them to stop the premise of getting drugs through the mail. The whole premise of the site will still be intact.<br /><br />2. Even if there is media upheaval from some major reporting of SR, there is very little chance that data on the average user of SR will be able to be captured, and even if it is, I seriously doubt that individual governments would be able to do anything with the information. In such a situation, it would be the distributors that would catch the most of the flak.<br /><br />3. There is always the chance that, due to recent circumstances regarding the policies of the international drug panel ( I forget it&#039;s actual name ) and what I inevitably see as a complete legalization of marijuana and reformation of drug policy in general that public attention will be shifted away from drug abuse and towards more fruitful things. In which case, if the public really doesn&#039;t care about the issue, the inevitable press of SR will have less effect.<br />

				You went from talking about them using molecular laser scanning already in airports and mail to referencing some obscure marketing article from a tech firm...<br /><br />I agree that theoretically the technology is possible.<br /><br />Actually being able to deploy such technology on a massive scale to prove effective is where I disagree.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I am not seeing how a marketing article from a company who likely hasn&#039;t even developed the technology they are requesting funding for in the press release shows how it would happen today.<br />

Nobody dissociates from someone because they pirate movies occasionally. But if that person occasionally drops acid, or occasionally does meth or MDMA or god forbid RC&#039;s or heroin, I&#039;d bet a good half of the people you talk to offhand would refuse to further your relationship past anything more than acquaintance level. That&#039;s the sad reality of it; the public, indoctrinated as it is, believes drugs to be a REAL threat, not something intangible like piracy. Drug addiction has real effects on people and they don&#039;t understand that legalization and education on the dangers and merits of different drugs is the only way to truly combat dangerous drug addiction. It is going to be a very long time for that to get through the skulls of the centrist-conservative-leaning majority in the USA. That&#039;s just the way things are.<br /><br />Which brings back what someone said about television; if it WAS found out that some teenager who had everything going for them OD&#039;d on some drug they got from SR, and the media publicized it, I have no doubt that there would be media backlash enough to warrant a major investigation. Whether that would amount to anything, I don&#039;t know. But the power of the people seems to be severely underestimated in this thread. Everyone&#039;s talking about how the goverment is either this giant evil mass of conglomerate power or some sort of dying shell of a former self, but no one is mentioning the real power that the media can have in this issue, and how easily it would be to spin the public opinion and therefore change what the government can and will do.<br /><br />Think about it: what MAJOR power is going to stop the government of any nation from seeking to destroy SR? I doubt that any government will understand that the nature of this site is truly benevolent. What will happen if the government shuts it down? There might be some scuffles between nations remarking upon the idea that any one government can control the endless recesses of the darknet. But will wars erupt? will people die for this? I doubt it. The world will eventually go back to normal. <br /><br />That being said, I think that it would be extremely hard for any force to do any reasonable damage to SR, the foundation is relatively sound given what it is accomplishing. But can they make it hard to run this operation? I think so. Will they? I don&#039;t think anybody knows for sure. But like people have said, people who are saying that there&#039;s no way it could happen are living in a dream-world. I don&#039;t think anybody can guarantee anything in this regard, for sure.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Am compelled to give A Riotous Defect +1 for well composed article, I mean post.

				Personally, I don&#039;t really worry about SR getting busted.&nbsp; I live in the United States, and I don&#039;t believe that our government, or any government sees shutting down SR as a wise use of resources.&nbsp; I believe this for the simple reason that shutting down SR won&#039;t stop vendors from selling.&nbsp; Even if SR were to be shut down, you could still place orders with vendors through Tormail, BMR, or any other website that would pop up in an attempt to mimic the success of SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s really not a battle worth fighting.&nbsp; Not to mention, SR has probably fueled quite a number of drug busts.&nbsp; All it takes is one mistake and the DEA can be knocking down your door.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Also, although SR has grown tremendously over the past year, it is important to keep in mind that SR is only responsible for a tiny fraction of the drug trade.&nbsp; Authorities are better off focusing on criminals they can actually see, instead of chasing ghosts on the deep web.

				Also consider that the SR is just a tool for vendors to do their business, its something many people over the world are capable of building and even if SR did go down, another online black marketplace will pop up in its place.

Technology has matured beyond the capabilities of law enforcement. This is the essence of crypto-anarchy: no amount of guns in the world can solve a math problem. They have all the guns, but smart people create encryption and routing protocols that provide (practically) unbreakable privacy and anonymity. SR is just the beginning. Wait until something like BitWasp or its successor takes off, when anyone can download a zero-install software package similar to the Tor Browser Bundle, but it&#039;s an anonymous market platform that can run as a hidden service off their own computer. No programming or internet hosting knowledge required. Just extract and start accepting orders, safely, securely, anonymously.<br /><br />Despite increased law enforcement and penalties, more people can get a wider variety of purer drugs than ever. I think we&#039;re winning.

				In an open and free market, businesses operate for 1 reason.&nbsp; To make a profit.&nbsp; That can be seen as greed I suppose.<br />If it is true that all human actions boil down to being in self interest only and therefore greed.&nbsp; But from a market perspective,<br />SR is here to make a profit for the owner and provide value for its members.&nbsp; The profit is shared amongst the vendors<br />and the administration, while the value is shared amongst the buyers.&nbsp; When the value that is offered by this marketplace<br />is no longer there, then the business will no longer operate.&nbsp; I guess if you look at providing a value proposition to the <br />markets as greed, then it is greed.&nbsp; I do not necessarily see that as greed.&nbsp; Are all businesses that operate either IRL or <br />on the darknets greed?<br /><br />

				when SR is busted is not really relevant ....it will be, no doubt.<br />The reality is that within a week there is a new market or we all go to the next best thing BM or whatever.<br />What I think is important that what you do here (or in another place) has meaning.<br />That could be you making money, making money helping people, selling because you feel good doing that or making people happy that you are selling what they want/need.<br />Just for greed, just to get as much money as you can without the need for it -what greed is in my opinion- its no use.<br />When you are really hungry and want to eat badly in my idea you are not greedy...you&#039;re hungry.<br />When you are not hungry but keep putting food on your plate you cannot even eat and make sure others don;t get that....thats greedy <br />Well, being here also brings frustration which&nbsp; others find a good reason when expressing that to bring you down.<br />The frustration wanting to log in and not able to ....<br />When its greed you loose money, you can be annoyed or irritated by that.<br />When not able to contact customers who need what you have, waiting desperately for you to ship the order (and that in the real sense) that is frustrating.<br />Today, again, for 8 hours trying now and 1 time connected and kicked of is not good.<br />And yes, new ID 10x, TOR working fine for everything TORmail, SR forum except SR login.<br />SR busted/going down, no doubt. You see it crumble by the day. Everytime there is something, wile back the big down time, took ages to fix. <br />All little things we don&#039;t even know because it is hidden for our eyes and now with the photo&#039;s and all.<br />One day a smart hacker comes in and fuckes it up big time.<br />I&#039;ve been here some time as a vendor, long enough to see the difference in attitude over time.<br />Even the customers change. When I started there were &#039;&#039;normal&#039;&#039; questions in the messages.<br />Now often they are so rude that I don&#039;t even want to answer them...I do but tell them i will not sell to them :-0<br />A customer ask me something, I say I cannot do that and he give me an attitude you will not believe. <br />If you see the energy around it, all the things that happen ...its coming down, no doubt.....<br />.<br />&nbsp;

Let&#039;s say greed is a kind of FORCE in our psycho-physiological system.<br /><br />To be able to control a force, one has to have might over an other force which can work diametrical to the first: 2 forces with opposite qualities.

That doesn&#039;t mean that greed can&#039;t lead to very negative consequences. Greed is an instinctual driver which is OK in animals, b&#039;coz the haven&#039;t free will. So the greed in animals is controlled outside their own will, &quot;from an other instance&quot;, if you will.<br /><br />The real problems arise in humanity - but we haven&#039;t reached that level really, we are more on a level of intellectual animals - where greed can be pushed for consciously. This is the reason why you will never find such perversity and monstrosity amongst animals, like you can find amongst humanity. At that level, greed can corrupt a character so much, that you can&#039;t speak of a human being anymore. This is where things turn really ugly.<br /><br />Does this meet your direction of thinking?<br /><br />Hulk</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Hi.<br /><br />Basically it does.&nbsp; Like I said in an earlier post about businesses being in business to make a profit.&nbsp; That isn&#039;t really greed.&nbsp; If those running the business<br />begin to do things outside of the normal rules, like price fixing and price gouging, that is where we see greed some into play.&nbsp; &nbsp; Otherwise it is <br />a mere drive to exist in the world of today.&nbsp; Right?

				If Silkroad gets taken down another will spring up to take it&#039;s place.<br /><br />Packages may get intercepted more, so packaging will evolve.<br /><br />The pirate bay is still up and accessible by many methods even though ISP&#039;s&nbsp; must block it by law.<br /><br />Even if they take the internet down then the technology may be developed to create a peer to peer internet using wireless.
