				Hi i bought an item on SR, sent my address using his PGP and the BTC has left my account.<br /><br />when i go to orders it says it is &quot;processing&quot;<br /><br />i understand there is some kind of escrow system and i need to finalize and i have no issue with doing it now and the seller may be waiting for me to do so as i have no feedback?<br /><br />could someone explain please either how to finalize or if i even need to? is it possible there is no escrow with this transaction? i am not sure if the transaction is waiting on me to do something or not, thanks.<br /><br />

				Do not finalize the order before the package arrives to your door unless the seller has a very good reputation.&nbsp; Finalizing will release your money out of limbo and into the sellers hands.&nbsp; If you&#039;re confused as to what is going on then communicate with the seller to clear things up.&nbsp; If the order has only displayed processing for a few hours then don&#039;t worry about it, the seller probably just hasn&#039;t logged on yet.&nbsp; Just give it some time and if nothing happens then shoot the seller a message and ask whats going on.<br /><br />Sun.<br /><br />Also, read this if you haven&#039;t already.<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide

				the seller has around 20 pages of good feedback so i trust he is legit.<br /><br />how do i go about finalizing? i cant see an option anywhere.<br /><br />it has been &quot;processing&quot; for about 2 days now.]<br /><br />edit: i think i have worked it out, i can only finalize if the seller has marked it as shipped?

				I&#039;m glad this was summed up. I&#039;m about to make my first buy on here and was also curious about the way the escrow system worked. I was afraid I would not know how to use it properly. Awesome.
