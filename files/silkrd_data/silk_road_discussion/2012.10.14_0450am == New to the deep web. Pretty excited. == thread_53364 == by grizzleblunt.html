				Hey Silk Road! Just wanted to introduce myself. I first heard of Silk Road through a &quot;wired&quot; magazine article earlier this year while I was doing time at Victorville FCI II for bank robbery. I was automatically intrigued.<br />I found out about the &quot;deep web&quot; just yesterday. I can&#039;t wait to do some more exploring. My interests are ez money making, and I would also like to learn the art of hacking. If anyone has any pointers for a complete newb, plz feel free to PM me or leave a comment below. Any tips would be appreciated, as I am completely new to all of this.

				By the way BlarghRawr 1) how the fuck is anyone suppose to find me with the very vague info I gave? There are countless bank robbers that have been released this year from Victorville. 2) I&#039;m not buying or selling on here so why would anyone even be interested in me?

Right now, they&#039;re just not sure how to accomplish it.&nbsp; <br /><br />It almost goes without saying that Silk Road is being discussed at the very highest levels of every major law enforcement agency, both in the U.S. as well as abroad. See the following thread for more information:&nbsp; Australian LE Report on BC/SR - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38319.0<br />&nbsp; <br />Everyone who posts on here is a potential target. LEA scours this board looking for information -- everything goes into a database. You have to consider that everything that you say on here goes into a record, which, even if not immediately useful,&nbsp; may well provide the missing piece of the puzzle at some future time. That&#039;s why discretion is the watchword here. <br /><br />Learning the proper tools and techniques (e.g. TrueCrypt and PGP) are a large part of keeping you safe, however, in and of themselves they are not sufficient. The one thing that is indispensable on here is a proper, security-oriented mindset.&nbsp; The best cryptographic tools in the world cannot protect you from yourself. If you are indiscreet, eventually that will prove to be your undoing. <br /><br />

That reduces the list of possibilities to a few hundred people max. And that is just in your first post. If you get sloppy at a later moment and reveal some tiny detail about yourself, it will make the list even shorter.<br /><br />Then all LE has to do is go to your ISP and ask who of the guys recently connected to a Tor node.
