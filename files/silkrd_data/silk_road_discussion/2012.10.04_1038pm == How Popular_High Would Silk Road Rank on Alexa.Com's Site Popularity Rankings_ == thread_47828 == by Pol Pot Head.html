				I am pretty sure Silk Road is by far the most popular site on the .onion domain, but since the TOR Network is very small compared to the Clearnet, I don&#039;t think Silk Road would rank extremely high (as in anywhere near the top hundreds in popularity) compared to clearnet sites in terms of daily traffic, page visits, and number of individual users visiting. <br /><br />Still I would expect Silk Road to be around the popularity of Encyclopedia Dramatica (ED) if not more popular than it. <br /><br />https://encyclopediadramatica.se/Main_Page<br /><br />Let&#039;s see ED has about 12.9 million page views on its front page.<br />The current version of ED has been around since April 12, 2011 which was about 1 year, 4 months ago (or 16 months). <br />16 months translates to roughly 1.25 years.<br />Each year has about 456.25 days (365 days/ year * 1.25 years&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;456.25 days).<br /><br />So let&#039;s do some simple math to figure out the number of average daily&nbsp; page views ED gets on its FRONT PAGE: (note that the site has a total of hundreds of millions of total views from all of the views or individual clicks on its over 10,000 articles):<br /><br />12,900,000&nbsp; page views (divided by)&nbsp; 456.25 days<br />&nbsp;= 28, 274 page views per day on Its FRONT PAGE <br /><br />I think the site has around 500 million total page views (of all its 10,000 + pages) so doing some simple math we can calculate that the site gets roughly <br />1 million page views in total per day.<br />And yet it is only ranked at around 24,000th in&nbsp; popularity on the Clearnet (given that there are so many other very popular sites on the Clearnet).<br /><br />Here are the stats for ED on Alexa.com<br />http://www.alexa.com/search?q=stormfront&amp;r=site_siteinfo&amp;p=bigtop<br /><br />So a better question would be this: how popular would Silk Road and its forum rank compared to some other relatively well-known&nbsp; Clearnet sites (like Encyclopedia Dramatica, Uncyclopedia, Stormfront, and AnonIB)?
