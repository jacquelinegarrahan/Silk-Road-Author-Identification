				First, we had the attacks on Mt. Gox and Bitfloor. While Mt. Gox was under attack, Bitfloor seemed to be the main alternative for BTC trading. Then Bitfloor closes down permanently. We then start getting DDOS attacks on SR shortly after a new market (Atlantis) opens up. I have even had trouble accessing the SR forums today at times, so I&#039;m wondering if they might also be targeted. And to top it off, I have been getting &quot;Bad Connection To Database&quot; errors today when trying to access my Tormail account. It&#039;s as if someone wants to interrupt all business and communication on SR and &quot;push&quot; people to BMR, or the recently opened Atlantis. Your thoughts on this would be appreciated.<br /><br />EDIT: I also failed to bring up the fact that during each major attack, BTC values plummeted the first time, and have risen significantly the past two days. I know I&#039;m stating the obvious here, and my views may be too simplistic, but often times the easiest explanation is the correct one.

				If you&#039;re involved in DDoS attacks, the last thing you want to do is establish a pattern or organization, unless you plan on a one time massive assault.<br /><br />The main DDoS draw back is that it takes cost and/or time to constantly keep up an attack. What could look like patterned attacks could just be different assholes and skiddies having their jollies, or competitors trying to make SR more volatile they get more biz. The only groups I could see doing planed/organized DDoS against SR are anti-drug techies (which there aren&#039;t many of) or LE. But not much use comes out of these things except for frustration, we&#039;re still going to use this site.

				I was just leaning towards Atlantis trying to lure SR people to their site. Think about it. SR for me, aside from the ability to purchase drugs, is so addictive, I STAY ON IT during my free time. It&#039;s more addictive than Facebook every was. I think I&#039;m not alone here. So, following that line of thinking, what happens when you take away someone&#039;s most prized toy? That someone is going to find another toy. Maybe not permanently, but a substitute nonetheless. So what if LE set up Atlantis as a HUGE sting operation and then orchestrated the attacks in a way that people from SR would go into &quot;SR Withdrawl&quot; and give Atlantis a shot? Just a theory.<br /><br />And I mentioned Atlantis in the OP for the reason stated above...DEFINITELY NOT to promote the site.<br /><br />EDIT: Gotta love the &quot;If I don&#039;t agree with you, I&#039;m gonna -1 you&quot; attitude! Oh that hurts so! ::evil grin::

				Well, it seems you are more knowledgeable on the subject of &#039;THAT SITE&#039; being brought up. I wasn&#039;t aware it had been mentioned so many times. And with that being said, I can see where you&#039;re coming from. On the karma note, I wasn&#039;t implicating anyone in particular. I could really care less...it&#039;s actually funny to me because I just told my buddy here, &quot;Watch what happens after I post this.&quot; I am really just dying to have SR back! Haven&#039;t been a member but a month or so and have made 5 purchases. I&#039;m addicted! <br /><br />EDIT: Tried the site ONE LAST TIME before I turned in for the night and BINGO! I&#039;m in!

				DDOS was on mtgox fucktard, and they do that to drive the price down so they can buy low. Attacking SR doesnt benefit anyone.

Gox causing BTC values to crash. It was even predicted the day before on the Alex Jones radio show. And attacking SR most definitely DOES benefit SOME, although not your average user. Nice Sense of Entitlement though. Anger issues MUCH?
