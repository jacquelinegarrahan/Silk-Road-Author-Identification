				Tired of spending hours per day keeping up with your Silk Road inbox?&nbsp; Spend more time corresponding and lest time waiting for page loads with the new bulk reply feature!&nbsp; Bulk reply will serve up the 10 oldest unread messages in your inbox ready for viewing and replying.&nbsp; Send all of your replies with a single click and get the next 10 served up on the next page load.&nbsp; Keep going until you are all caught up in a fraction of the time it used to take.&nbsp; Talking to your customers is fun again!!!!

				As your newest vendor, i want to thank you for everything that you are doing here. It was extremely stressful for me trying to get everything set up to see that seller registration had been closed. Now i am extremely happy. I hope to vend here for a very long time.<br /><br />Stay safe and thanks again!

				Sweet!<br /><br />Started on my PMs this morning, saw this new &#039;Bulk Reply&#039; linky thingie. Clicked on it, and was instantly transported to a world of rainbows and puppy dogs.<br /><br />After using it for a while, all I can say is, hot damn, does it ever speed up responding to PMs.<br /><br />Also, I think it made my penis a bit bigger.&nbsp; :)

				Thanks for this, can we maybe get a bulk reply for orders dispatched or an auto written letter for orders? I used to send them to customers just to let them know their order&#039;s been sent out &amp; how long to expect it by etc but I&#039;ve had to stop due to it being too time consuming.<br /><br />Maybe the ability to get a bulk replier for your last 10 dispatched orders/orders sent on the same date. Obviously not a bulk reply to anyone as that&#039;d creat a great potential for spam.
