				my friend placed a small order&nbsp; on Monday 2 days before site went down and was in transit the same night regular snail mail from east coast Canada to the west coast Canada he used this vendor numerous times before that&#039;s how I no it was coming from east coast. He never once used pgp for his hole 9 months on the road but received every order no problems. Was very respected vendor so 99.9% it was actually shipped but he has still not received anything is it safe to say LE has got it or should give it more time was in transit Monday evening late so I would guess Tuesday would be day one at the post office.

It takes 3-5 business days for mail to make it coast to coast in the US, but it gets delayed sometimes for much longer. I can&#039;t speak for Canada.<br /><br />The key words in all of this are &quot;small order.&quot; It&#039;s possible that the vendor marked it shipped a day or 2 before he mailed it (search these forums and you&#039;ll find several examples of that). So if he marked it shipped when he printed the label, but hadn&#039;t made it to the Post Office before realizing he would NEVER get paid (i.e. when he realized the site was shut down), he wouldn&#039;t have mailed it. High volume vendors were usually online daily.<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s in the mail; maybe it&#039;s not. I wouldn&#039;t lose any sleep over it. Is it really worth the Canadian [insert name of Canadian federal police here] to arrest your &quot;friend&quot; over less than 50g of weed? Isn&#039;t weed practically legal in BC anyway?&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />Next time, get some Beesters
