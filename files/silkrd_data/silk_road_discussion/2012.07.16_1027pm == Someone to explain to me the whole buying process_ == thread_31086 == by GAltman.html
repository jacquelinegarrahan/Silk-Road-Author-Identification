				Hello all,<br />I was wondering because I am very new to Silk Road, how would I buy something on here? I feel like it is so confusing. Can someone just explain/list out all of the steps that I would need to take to buy something successfully? Thanks,<br />GAltman

				this is what i did/is doing, altho atleast if ure in US there may be easier/safer ways to fund your account than this-<br />register an account at somewhere like www.bitstamp.net , login and register a deposit, then wire-transfer the selected amount to the address they give. Then wait 1-3days for the bitstamp account to receive the wire and fund the account.&nbsp; When funded, buy bitcoins with the dollar in bitstamp before sending them to the Bitcoin address found under the Account tab on Silk Road. Then wait few hours for coins to appear in my silk road account before I pick a drug, enter name/address in the box and click send before I sit back and wait for drugs to fall in my mailbox:]<br /><br />some more info in the &quot;How does it work?&quot; link in bottom of SR market site, aswell as many more here on the forum concerning everything from getting your account funded thru numerous ways, aquiring bitcoins etc. to ordering as safe as possible.. better keep reading forums a bit first=)<br /><br />welcome and goodluck^^

				It is much easier if you break it down into parts...<br /><br />1. Get bitcoins ( we only use bitcoins on Silk Road, there are plenty of threads as to why so DON&#039;T ask) find a thread on how to buy bitcoins, it really is very easy. Hell go to Google and search for &#039;buy bitcoins&#039; read the wiki... it is really not that hard.<br /><br />once you have your bitcoins the rest is REAL easy... transfer them to SR and buy what you want...<br /><br />Like I said... work on buying Bitcoins first and the rest will fall into place.<br /><br />Message me if I can help.<br /><br />TJ

				1) Set up an account.<br /><br />2) Buy a Green Dot Moneypak.&nbsp; Load about 300-500 bucks on it.<br /><br />3) Find a reputable bitcoin trader in the &quot;Money&quot; section of SR.&nbsp; BTC Buddy, Sugar Mama, Rapid Exchange all have a great reputation.<br /><br />4) Exchange you MP for btc.&nbsp; The vendor will deposit the coin straight into your SR account.<br /><br />5)&nbsp; Find something you want to buy.<br /><br />6) Message the vendor to see if he/she has any special requirements for a new buyer that may not be listed on their vendor page.&nbsp; Search for a vendor who will not require you to finalize early, preferably one selling something other than digital goods.&nbsp; Order some real product, something more tangible than a download.&nbsp; Do some research- these vendors do exist and are plentiful enough that you should have no trouble finding one.&nbsp; If you are asked to FE, politely decline and ask that the vendor please refund your money.<br /><br />7) Add the item to your cart.<br /><br />8 )&nbsp; Import the vendor&#039;s PGP key into your PGP program.&nbsp; Use GNuPG/GPA for Linux, or use GPG4WIN or GPG4USB on Windows platforms.<br /><br />9) Create a message so the vendor knows where to ship.&nbsp; Something like:<br />Please ship to:<br />Your name<br />Your address<br />Your City State, and zip code<br />(Say thank you)<br />(Copy your PGP Key)<br /><br />10) Encrypt your message with the vendor&#039;s public key.<br /><br />11) Open the encrypted message, copy and paste the contents into the address field on the order form.<br /><br />12) Enter your secondary password (PIN) into the required field.<br /><br />13) Click the &quot;submit&quot; button, or whatever the last button on the bottom of the order page reads.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember what it reads at the moment.<br /><br />14) Check SR regularly for a change in order status.&nbsp; It will change from &quot;processing&quot; to &quot;in transit&quot; once the vendor has shipped your item.<br /><br />15) If ordering domestically (US to US), you should receive your item somewhere between 3 to 7 business days.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes longer, but not usually.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t receive it within 7 days after the vendor has marked it as &quot;in transit&quot;, then message the vendor to see what&#039;s up.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ordered internationally, it will take longer.&nbsp; How much longer?&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; A couple, maybe even a few weeks, but international orders shouldn&#039;t take , on average, more than a couple of weeks.&nbsp; Be respectful and remember to use common sense and courtesy.<br /><br />16) Begin checking the mail when you think the package should arrive.<br /><br />17)&nbsp; Receive the package on the day it arrives, take it inside, inspect it to make sure it&#039;s what you ordered, and finalize.&nbsp; Ideally, you should be able to test the product at the time you take delivery, but this is not always feasible.&nbsp; You can go back and edit your feedback later if you find out it&#039;s shit, but give the vendor the benefit of the doubt and don&#039;t make him/her wait to get paid.<br /><br />18) If there is a problem with your order, message the vendor to see if you can work out an amicable solution privately.&nbsp; Do not immediately run to the forums and and cry scammer.&nbsp; You&#039;re dealing with another human being, and people make mistakes.&nbsp; Give the vendor an opportunity to make it right.&nbsp; Do not try to extort the vendor with bad feedback- it will only end poorly for the both of you.&nbsp; Try to work it out.&nbsp; If you are not able to come to an agreement, then, and only then, should you post your subjective experience in the forums.&nbsp; At this point, you should also change your feedback to reflect your experience.<br /><br />Check the forums for consistent, reliable, hard-working, and ethical vendors.&nbsp; Message them, see how long it takes them to respond.&nbsp; Read their reviews.&nbsp; See how they act when buyers report honest findings.&nbsp; Do they threaten to disclose names?&nbsp; Tell people to fuck off?&nbsp; Or are they calm, cool, collected, and willing to right a wrong?<br /><br />When you finally order, try to keep it domestic.&nbsp; Customs is just another potential risk that you can avoid.&nbsp; Keep your orders small, spread them out two or three different vendors.&nbsp; When you have a good experience, remember that vendor and rate him/her highly in the forums&nbsp; Cultivate a relationship, and use them again.&nbsp; Being a repeat buyer and a good customer will often get you a freebie tossed in, and sometimes extra weight in product.<br /><br />Good luck...&nbsp; Hope you get to enjoy the Road as much as I have (and still do)!

				I&#039;m pretty much a newb but I&#039;d say that I understand just about all the basics fairly well (Still didn&#039;t get to learning about PGP which is NECESSARY imo for anonymity).<br />I&#039;d have to disagree with all of the above stated methods (although they could be used with no problems at all). Your country seems to play a big part in this too. I am talking USA here.<br />Wiring money to buy bitcoins is an annoyance and it takes some time. Also direct link back to your personal bank account. And even worse right after buying the BTC transferring them straight to your SR account! What you&#039;re doing is:<br />Bank wire &gt; BTC vendor service &gt; Silk Road. Pretty easy and vulnerable links there eh?<br />Ive heard that getting a moneypak works pretty well and it&#039;s extremely anonymous. I wouldn&#039;t have a problem with doing this at all. The only thing I have a problem with is the amount the vendors take from you. I haven&#039;t done the exact math calculations but the method I use seems to take less money away from you! I honestly wouldn&#039;t mind trying Moneypak one day. Seems really simple and such an easy process. Literally you buy the card (just like buying a gift card), load it up, exchange it with a vendor for BTCs, $ is right in your SR account. Takes away the frustration of having to anonymity the process on your own! If it were me, I would only use this for larger payments like $200 plus. Because like I said the fucking fees seem like a bitch. I think it&#039;s like $6 for the card alone. Then for example, lets say you need $200. On a particular, well-known moneypak &gt; BTC vender&#039;s page it says the rate for $200 is 15%. THATS 30 FUCKIN DOLLARS! So pretty much all in all your spending $36 just to get a measly $200 into your SR. Or should I say $164 when the process is done.<br />The way I do it is bitinstant. Found it to be the absolute best and probably the most affordable with great security if done the proper way. The bank option is probably the easiest, fastest, and no identification information is required. The only thing that I could think of your personal information being comprised is through the security cameras in the bank. But I mean wtf, I feel like its not a big deal, for so many places have cameras. Hell even if you go to the store to get a moneypak I&#039;m sure theres cameras where you live.<br />I tried both the moneygram option and, as stated, the bank deposit option. I did the moneygram option first not knowing what the hell to expect or do. I couldn&#039;t find any info on the actual process of sending a moneygram. Never did it before. Long story short. You get on the phone, give out info needed for the deposit. Bad part is the lady on the phone shocked me by asking for my info. Gave her the real info but didn&#039;t mind. Went in with the mindset of testing it out. Once you get off the phone you just give the RL cashier the money and PEACE!<br />Bank was much easier and laid back. You just fill out a fuckin deposit slip. How much easier could that get? I mean I could legit fill out all the info at the comfort of my home (just jack a couple of those deposit slips and bring them home for future use). Then just go into the bank. Give money and the slip. Get receipt and be out. Could even do it through the drive through if you really wanted to. No IDing. No sketch things. Banks take deposits, what....millions upon billions a times a day?<br />After you did that process (I choose to put it into a mtgox account) I buy the bitcoins. ALL of this of course is being done on either a VPN, proxy, the tor network, or a combo of them. I pretty much have stayed connected to a VPN for over a year now ALL the time 24/7. Look into it. It&#039;s one of those things to me that are just &quot;why the hell would I not do that?&quot;. Even if I&#039;m not doing any darknet or shady, illegal things on the web I like to have the security of a VPN knowing that I am a truly free user of the internet system.<br />After I get the coins on mtgox just keep transferring them wallet to wallet to wallet. Then a BTC randomizer. Just keep fucking with the trace of it. Use blockchain.info and what not to track your payments.<br />It could get annoying to keep transferring and waiting for the funds but in my book its worth it.<br />Look into:<br />instawallet<br />easywallet<br />torwallet<br />bitcoin fog tumbler<br /><br />These will all help you with the above stated for anonymizing your bitcoins.<br />I dont have a problem with the above methods but the first stated (bank wire) seems to me, to have a deficiency in security and anonymity. The second method stated above (moneypak) seems awesome and I would love to do it too because it provides such great anonymity and barely ANY hassle. But the fees altogether just seem to add up to WAY to much that it&#039;s worth taking the time to anonymize yourself.<br /><br />Shit I&#039;m getting jumpy...time to rip the bong. Wrote a good amount there but if you got any questions Ill have to remember to look back lol.

(startpage.com for the anonfags like myself)<br />Wiki - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br />I have to say though the process of bitinstant wasn&#039;t explained that well to me. Even on the internet I could only find 1-2 articles specifically on bitinstant bank deposit to mtgox. In reality its not complex at all but I always like to know as much as possible before I take action. Its one of those things you just have to do and get comfortable with for yourself. Test out different methods and see which you like best. Maybe a walmart is closest to you so moneygram is the best option, or maybe you have a BOA right down the street to make a cash deposit.<br />Just test it out first. Do a couple of small transactions and buy some BS or fun stuff. Get some cool ebooks or play the lottos if you want to test your BTC out without making any truly illegal purchases.<br />The one thing I would recommend researching into is anonymizing your bitcoins overall. I still urge to learn more about that. Its the only other thing besides your address that would link you to SR and your purchases. Be wise!

				http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road<br /><br />I studied that article for about a week...haha&nbsp; :P Although, I didn&#039;t do everything like she did (used a different method to buy and transfer BTC, and I used a more straightforward way of PGP/GPG).
