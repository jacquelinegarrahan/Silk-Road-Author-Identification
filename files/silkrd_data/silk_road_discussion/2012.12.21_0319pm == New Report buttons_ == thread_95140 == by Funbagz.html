				Looks like SR just put new Report Item and Report Vendor buttons, or do these come available when my account reaches a certain age.

				We are always trying to improve SR and we have just added this new feature... When your reporting a vendor or item, please give a detailed message as to why. There will be a place for that when you click on &quot;report vendor&quot; or report item. If you don&#039;t put in the reason, we don&#039;t know what to look for, (unless its pretty obvious, then again, it may be obvious to you but not to the staff).<br /><br />This is not to replace the SR support messaging system. Please continue to use the messaging system like you were, but if your reporting a rogue vendor or see something that needs special attention, please use this new feature This is going to help us, help you and make SR a safer place.<br /><br />We will constantly improve and update the system, so if you see any changes, this is probably the reason. Remember, the resolution system is the same. The messaging system is the same. This will help us get to an issue much quicker. Please use it responsibly.<br /><br />~Flush

				Yeah I noticed it too. Pretty cool, but I have a feeling there&#039;s going to be some members reporting items/vendors for stupid ass reasons that will only slow down SR support.

				Is there some sort of function to automatically remove listings once they are reported X number of times, or are they investigated on a case by case basis?

				They should put me in control of that report button and let me do some regulating around this bitch for obvious reasons, I&#039;m always right. It&#039;s a fact at this point.

				Im just noticing it also.. Yea Im sure Vendors are gonna be making BS accounts reporting on each other or just dumb stuff.. I hope it helps somewhat. Maybe you should get those scammers out of here with a 55 rating and other just as low or bout the same.. Its clear they are screwing ppl over and over and im guessing its the newbies that dont realize how to utilize everything thats for them on&nbsp; here..

				Yeah, I see a lot of ways this can be abused but you&#039;re right a lot of the scams happen to new buyers trying to get btc or they FE.. at least with this option right in front of your face now support might get to them a little sooner.

				Could this be implemented in a way that only allows users with X number of transactions to actually report listings and vendors? that could cut down on the competition reporting other vendor listings from shill accounts. also, are you able to report a listing more than once from the same account? I don&#039;t think you should be able to for the same reason, but I haven&#039;t yet seen an actual announcement about how the new feature works. Maybe I will put up a listing to get some of these questions answered.<br /><br />let&#039;s find out how this feature works<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/afefdece46

				Just because someone reports something doesn&#039;t mean we are going to do what they say.. We look at each one and investigate. If it has merit, we take action. if not, we move on...<br /><br />~Flush

				Im digging it. <br /><br />Already used it on 1 obvious scenario...more to see how it works then point anything out. <br /><br /><br />Very cool. there is a 2nd screen to it where you pick a radio button and then can fill in the text with your details.<br /><br /><br />Very cool. Our own SR NARC button. ;)<br />
