				one downside of closed registrations is it has already prevented a few vendors i know of from being able to register accts to begin selling<br /><br />something definitely needed to be done to get the site functional, so for now this is great for the current members<br /><br />but should it move to invite only or remain closed, we also need to allow new vendors to join in order to provide product as the old vendors stop for whatever reason

				I&#039;m a newbie myself, so as much of a right as I have to make suggestions... I think some measure of temporarily slowing down the growth of SR would be prudent at this point. Or some sort of new deterrent implemented to keep out those who aren&#039;t serious. I like Looselucy&#039;s idea. Some kind of a small initial deposit to create an account, which could be refunded after the first successful transaction, or a week of being a member, something like that. <br /><br />But I trust that DPR and the SR staff have their own solutions. They are the brains of the operation, after all.

				I propose a limited buyer account system:<br /><br />1. Registration remains open<br /><br />2. When any user (whether they want to buy or sell) first registers, they have the following restrictions (let&#039;s call it a restricted account):<br />&nbsp;- cannot message vendors<br />&nbsp;- cannot favorite vendors<br />&nbsp;- cannot add items to cart<br />&nbsp;- cannot deposit/withdraw BTC<br /><br />3. To move from a restricted account to a regular buyer or seller account:<br />&nbsp;- user clicks a link on their account page to start the unrestricted process<br />&nbsp;- user must scroll through a buyers guide or such (should cover PGP as well) and check an &quot;I read it&quot; checkbox<br />&nbsp;- user is provided a public key and a unique message to encrypt, and must paste the PGP encrypted message into a form<br />&nbsp;- if the message decrypts properly, the user is now a standard buyer account, and can attempt to become a seller if so desired<br /><br />My reasoning behind this is to still allow curious people to browse the site, but to force serious buyers to have some baseline understanding of the site. The guide that new users have to read should cover how to use the site (adding/withdrawing funds, checking out, account settings, finalizing/feedback), how to pick a reputable vendor and avoid scams, how to use PGP, and how to become a seller. Requiring a test PGP encryption will increase the average security of the community as more people use it. The account unrestriction process as a whole will slow down people making fake accounts for scams and such. There should be a new forum category for newbies to post in that have questions regarding the process as well.<br /><br /><br />

Registration remains open<br /><br />2. When any user (whether they want to buy or sell) first registers, they have the following restrictions (let&#039;s call it a restricted account):<br />&nbsp;- cannot message vendors<br />&nbsp;- cannot favorite vendors<br />&nbsp;- cannot add items to cart<br />&nbsp;- cannot deposit/withdraw BTC<br /><br />3. To move from a restricted account to a regular buyer or seller account:<br />&nbsp;- user clicks a link on their account page to start the unrestricted process<br />&nbsp;- user must scroll through a buyers guide or such (should cover PGP as well) and check an &quot;I read it&quot; checkbox<br />&nbsp;- user is provided a public key and a unique message to encrypt, and must paste the PGP encrypted message into a form<br />&nbsp;- if the message decrypts properly, the user is now a standard buyer account, and can attempt to become a seller if so desired<br /><br />My reasoning behind this is to still allow curious people to browse the site, but to force serious buyers to have some baseline understanding of the site. The guide that new users have to read should cover how to use the site (adding/withdrawing funds, checking out, account settings, finalizing/feedback), how to pick a reputable vendor and avoid scams, how to use PGP, and how to become a seller. Requiring a test PGP encryption will increase the average security of the community as more people use it. The account unrestriction process as a whole will slow down people making fake accounts for scams and such. There should be a new forum category for newbies to post in that have questions regarding the process as well.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, this is a much better idea than using some kind of invite system, or requiring a fee to set up new buyer accounts. Just adding a few hoops new users would have to jump through in order to become full members would accomplish all that&#039;s necessary, without doing anything extreme like invites or fees.

				also, perhaps turning off the images on the website by default for users with an option to &quot;show images&quot; more readily available (as in over an image) will speed up the website. Even scaling the image sizes down would be good. taking the image of the &quot;login&quot; part back to text only will also help speed up the website.<br /><br />when a user comes into the main page and category listings most of the images they see they dont need to look at and stopping that mass download of images on the main page will significantly speed up the site

				I think you guys are too willing to throw away your anonymity.<br /><br />Look at the BTC vendors. And the Vendors of other materials that want to cash out their BTC with one of them.<br /><br />I&#039;m posting under this name to piss you off, yes. But when I do business with a BTC Vendor, I never use the same account twice. I make an account, do my business, and never use it again. It would be foolish for a vendor to NOT do that. I don&#039;t know a vendor of any good on SR that wants to get IDed even one way, much less bi-directionally. Only a fool would want to correlate their seller name with their BTC cashing name. Or buying name. Or do the same thing twice. You kill anonymity with a pattern of any kind. We have that nailed technologically, so other more tangible methods are all LE will bother with. Is the BTC vendor LE? Is SR? Ohhhh spooky..... Any one of these can fuck you. Don&#039;t link yourself.<br /><br />That&#039;s what makes this business possible; 1) you can&#039;t follow the money, and 2) you can&#039;t rat out your supplier. That is how LE finds suppliers. The buyers rat them out (or a sub category, the buyers are LE), or they follow the money. Both ends are broken. If you start linking it up, it loses it&#039;s usefulness and only morons will remain a part of it. Taking away a vendor&#039;s ability to make a random fake account without any permission, invite, or correlation will really hurt a vendor&#039;s desire to be here. Not to mention the fact that lots of people prefer obtaining BTC here to begin with... No names. All the suggestions I see intrude upon these crucial disconnects. If I saw it happening, I&#039;d be very concerned that SR had been compromised and was trying to strengthen it&#039;s ability to narrow down identities.<br /><br />I have to buy something before I can sell my BTC to a BTC vendor?<br /><br />I have to deposit BTC before I can get BTC the only way I know how because I&#039;m a noob?<br /><br />The suggestions I&#039;m seeing are clearly not well thought out. Big surprise...<br /><br />These suggestions would utterly destroy the backbone of how this place runs. Your perspective is not all encompassing. You&#039;ll need to get a big-picture view of what is going on before you can contribute. &quot;Me me me want want want&quot; isn&#039;t the only thing that matters. It takes brains to do this...<br /><br />This isn&#039;t my only account. Vendors need to come and go, at least their names do. You don&#039;t want to build a list too long... I don&#039;t abuse anything. It&#039;s essential to my business, and that&#039;s not just this name...<br /><br />

				I will be very disappointed if registration does not open again.<br /><br />I&#039;m a long time researcher and have heard about this community for some time. Thought I&#039;d come check it out. There are handful of things I&#039;d really like to find that have never been available. Hopefully I can find a solution here.

				And I think any buyer with over 100 transactions should get his gear purchased by SilkRoad on every 3rd transaction there after. With xpress shipping.<br /><br />Well look at that. I would be one of those buyers...LMMFAO!<br /><br />Bikerbum

				I think it should now be &#039;pay to play&#039; vendors *and* buyers both.&nbsp; Keep out the shills and the ripoffs...or at least slow them down....I gotta hand it to the bosses ...they keep trying to find ways to keep us in escrow, and to eliminate the scammers...but this place is just to juicy a morsel for the thieves...but now that we&#039;re known, and have enough people to ensure plenty of dough to the owners, I definitely think it&#039;s time to start charging to sign up....too many otherwise, have several accounts, and it takes a while to know who you can trust, and who is just a shill for the vendors...

				I&#039;m glad they closed registrations, and if they haven&#039;t, they definitely should.&nbsp; There are assholes who have posted the SilkRoad Url and instructions on how to get here on youtube and everywhere else making it a breeze for idiots or law enforcement to get on and get closer to shutting it down.&nbsp; It was meant to be mildly difficult to find to weed out the morons.&nbsp;
