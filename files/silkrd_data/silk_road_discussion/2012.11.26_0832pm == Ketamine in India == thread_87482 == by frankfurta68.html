				I am making a college trip to India very soon and wondered if it is possible to get Ketamine &quot;over the counter&quot; there. If there are can anyone recommend any places?<br />

				I&#039;ve asked my regular sources there and none have it but some i don&#039;t deal with do. I&#039;ve heard that if you go to a pharmacy and they don&#039;t have something or want you to have a prescription first, a little &quot;gift&quot; to the person for their help will go a long way. The only time i&#039;ve seen it for sale from india its been in liquid form for injections, same with pakistan. I know its around but i doubt a tourist is going to run into any big time powder ket merchants.<br /><br />Even if you found some powder, how do you get it back? They watch for that and india is somewhat suspect. Not as much as pakistan but more than europe.

				i don&#039;t want to bring it back but there is about 150 of us going and I know almost half of them do ketamine. I could find a seller who will do me 100g and sell it all and pay for my trip plus a little ket for me :) I&#039;d be really interested to know if anyone has experienced over the counter kets in India! :)

				yeah, just bribe a pharmacist or veterinarian and see if they can help you out.&nbsp; ur most certainly gonna get liquid but its super easy to cook into a powder.&nbsp; pour the liquid on a flat glass or ceramic plate and either pop it in a microwave for 30 seconds (or until all liquid is boiled off) or double boil it for 10 minutes (or until all liquid is boiled off).<br /><br />back in MY day that was the only way to get more than a 20-sack of K.
