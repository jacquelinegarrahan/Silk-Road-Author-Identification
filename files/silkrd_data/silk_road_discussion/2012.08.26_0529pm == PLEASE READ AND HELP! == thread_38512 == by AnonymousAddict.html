				I was just wondering can i just use the SR account # and put it in and bitinstant insted of sending them to a wallet? I mean why have the money sent to a wallet then to Sr if you can just post the SR address in at bitinstant? I was thinking About using the send to email option, insted i just watched the video of lady bytes on bitinstant and used the same page address she uses for a wallet, its called block something, but iv got a wallet set up now..Again though why send to the wallet then here when it would be just as easy to send them direct to my SR account?

				If you bought your BTC totally anonymous with cash, never revealing your identity, then I don&#039;t think sending the funds direct to your SR account should be much of a security issue.<br /><br />If you are some how connected to the BTCs because of your purchase method I would mix or tumble them before sending them to SR.<br /><br />Not sure if this is proper advice but it is what I have gathered so far. Simply sending the coins through another wallet isn&#039;t going to help with traceability. Play around at blockchain.info and you can follow the path of coins around. This will give you some insight to how things could be tracked back to you.

				In theory you should be fine transferring directly to SR, but paying the small fees to go through a tumbler or a fog service definitely makes it easier to sleep at night.

				I&#039;ve often wondered this. Is there any way someone can know (by looking at the block-chain maybe) that a wallet address is a Silk Road wallet?

				I don&#039;t think your SR wallet necessarily has its own bitcoin wallet. SR can have as many or few wallets as it wants but keep its own math on who holds which coins. It wouldn&#039;t be hard for someone to withdraw coins from SR and see which wallet they came from and what other activity that wallet has had.<br /><br />People have identified large wallets they believe to be owned by SR.

				Just in-case there&#039;s anything linking you to those coins, I&#039;d put it through a tumbler first (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion).<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;d direct the deposit at your Bitcoinfog address, then send to SR from there.<br />

				I dont use bitinstant i use an Australian service were i deposit cash at a bank and i choose to get coins sent directly to my SR account, the only thing that ties me to the SR account would be the camera footage from the bank. Im only purchasing personal amounts so im not worried at all about LE going to any effort to trace where the coins came from and even if they did they would only get the footage and would need alot of investigating to track me down anyway.<br /><br />At the end of the day it all depends how safe you want to be, if you want absolutely no evidence (advisable with big purchases) then use a service like bitcoin fog and tumble the coins, if not then take it easy and deposit straight to SR, but i would never ever use a credit, debit or bank transfer to purchase coins and then send to SR, only cash bank deposits.
