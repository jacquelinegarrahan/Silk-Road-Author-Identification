				Hey<br /><br />Just wanted to know the quickest way to get in touch with a moderator?<br /><br />I purchase or athought I was buying bitcoins forms a vendor called TopSecret today, I was assured that once the funds were collected from western union the coin would be sent to me but they haven&#039;t and ever since I&#039;ve gotten notification that the funds were picked up they have stopped responding.<br /><br />Here I was buying from a vendor with rating on SR was safe and I think I&#039;ve just brunt 300usd.

				Sorry to break it to you but it looks like its going to be a 300usd lesson for you about doing business on the Road. Unfortunately SR Admins can&#039;t do much except ban his account if he does prove to be a scammer. Hopefully your post will prevent other users from doing business with this guy.

				Hey,<br /><br />Just wanted to provide an update. Topsecret has made contact and provided what appears a genuine reason. We have come to an alternate arrangement which is that I will receive items. Would have used the coins to buy directly from him/her.<br /><br />I will keep everyone updated as I&#039;m hoping this works out well after all!

				Sounds like topsecret needs to be reported for acting outside the rules of SR. OOE sales are a big NONO because SR loses his cut.

				This is a perfect example of what NOT TO DO!<br /><br />I have read a lot of these type of post (over 50) and every single one that I have read the OP comes back in and says something like &quot; oh never mind I just got it&quot; or something like that. And it is never because the vendor read the post in here.... it is because the buyer panics.<br /><br />First thing...The mods can&#039;t do shit for you. It is not there job. If you have a problem on SR then go to SR!!! Contact support on SR not in the forums.<br /><br />Second thing if this happens to you and you make a post like this...do yourself a favor and delete the post! I am glad the OP got it figured out. But it go&#039;s to show you that if you relax and you are patient then 99.99% of the time everything will be fine.<br /><br />The other .01%...... Your fucked.

				In my case its been over 9 days and they still never got back to me. I contacted SR and they suggested i use the voucher to buy from somewhere else first. I did and it worked a treat!<br />I do feel a little guilty now in case something bad had happened to them. :-[<br /><br />
