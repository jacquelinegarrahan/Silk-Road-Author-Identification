				http://gawker.com/5926440/are-authorities-closing-in-on-the-online-drug-market-silk-road<br /><br />I&#039;m yet to see conclusive proof either way that SR is in trouble but shit like this being published tends to make me kind of nervous. It&#039;s talking about a DEA investigation, DPR&#039;s mysterious absence, and a man who is supposedly tony76 being arrested in Canada. Not really sure what to make of it all. Thoughts?

				I think people forget that journalist and agencies like the FBI and DEA sometimes work very closely together, especially if said journalists lean towards the law-and-order perspective. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the FBI and DEA constructed the information they gave Gawker so the article was written to make people on edge.

				I personally think Gawker sucks. Anonymous hacked them awhile back and I believe it was for a good reason. I&#039;m not a member of Anonymous but I find myself leaning more and more toward their cause by reading a bit about them and fucking around here with archo-libertarians. I think on their principles there should be more of an Anonymous presence here. <br /><br />

				Sadly SR will eventually go down and using btc/tor will be a thing of the past......BUT the bright side is somebody out there with the skills and balls (like DPR) will create a new &quot;SR&quot; using a diffrent median than btc/tor. Im really not worried this is a great thing while it lasts and I hope the next thing will be just as good :)

				I still wouldn&#039;t be worried unless you&#039;re some bigtime vendor who regularly makes huge deals. The DEA isn&#039;t looking to bust small time buyers experimenting with different drugs for recreational. How often do you hear about DEA raiding houses to seize 2 or 3 tabs of LSD? Rarely, if ever... but how often do you hear about the DEA busting huge coke shipments?

				It&#039;s kind of eerie to read something in an article that I just read on the forums earlier in the day&nbsp; ;D. I can&#039;t wait until they name drop me! (writes a user who goes by the name Mr. California). <br /><br />Seriously though, obviously the DEA is investigating us, they have to push their lame and worthless Anti-drug agenda, as well as try to prop up their failing War on Drugs. <br /><br />Personally, I kind of like reading Gawker, but stupid stories like these kind of ruin it. They probably just trot back here every time they&#039;re short on stories.

All of this time and not a single report about us on a major American news network. The muggles would eat this story up, it&#039;s obvious the gub&#039;mint is trying to contain this story.

				I am just not sure if they can actually take down SR without taking down the TOR network and somehow banning or controlling bitcoins. The organic non decentralized&nbsp; nature of the market place makes it extremely difficult to pin-point ring leaders.<br /><br />I have no doubt LE is buying off SR for intelligence purposes, but they will only be able to take dealers down, or at least block their efforts&nbsp; and with a great deal of resources spent doing it. SR will remain existing, and if you are a vendor its relatively easy to evade authorities (which I will not elaborate on)<br /><br />Personally I think the bitcoin hoarding is going on by the feds to make it difficult as possible for vendors and buyers.

				I guess it would be easier to shut down the peaceful folk on Silk Road and shout to the world you&#039;ve had a &quot;major breakthrough in the War On Drugs&quot; than to actually have the guts to go for the vicious violent bikie gangs/organized crime/South-Central American Cartel scum that truly profit from the misery of others.<br /><br />Just fuckin legalize it.&nbsp; Yeah, it would probably hurt the Road and cost us all a bit more for our drugs but I&#039;m okay with that if a whole lot less people die.

				It&#039;s clear what happened. Some bloke at Gawker saw the news article that was done a few weeks ago (they mentioned that the DEA had an ongoing investigation on SR) and then right after that article, I noticed a few threads saying that DPR was MIA.. <br /><br />So, that gawker guy/girl saw both of those (with the thread that asks if that canadian bust had anything to do with sr) and made a stupid article about shit we already knew.. they are grasping for news, obv... There was absolutely no substance to that article at all...Just to spread fear or to get people to read...and there was nothing published that wasn&#039;t already here in the forums. why doesn&#039;t gawker just post the onion url to the forums? it would be much better news, lol..

It could be an attempt at an intersection attack, which is why you should never mention when specifically you are going to be posting here or not. I think DPR already knows that but others should be wary too. <br /><br />I also think we should have a emergency channel separate to the Internet itself, using Numbers Stations to communicate basic information. Numbers Stations are a special kind of radio station, basically impossible to find from what I&#039;ve heard, but anybody can pickup their signals. Not sure about the communication distance, but it seems to me that if the radius was large enough, then for a couple of hundred bucks the Silk Road could have a back-up channel on the mainland and in Europe. Getting the equipment might not be so easy (to obtain it anonymously I mean), I&#039;m pretty sure the government keeps a close eye on this stuff. But China... enough said.<br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t be anything like the utility of carrying an entire forum about of course, but a tiny amount of information in the right place and time in an emergency could be absolutely pivotal to SR resilience e.g. DPR: ohai Ima alive! or &quot;In the event of SR blackout, here is the new address + this message is signed with my zillion bit PGP key sig to prove this is legit&quot;.<br /><br />Also, Numbers Stations sound totally badass when you listen to them on a receiver or pickup a stray signal on some piece of equipment, there&#039;s no reason why James Bond types should get all the fun! :D <br /><br />Protip concept for anarchy: I suspect it is possible to effectively DDOS police radio channels for pretty much forever. Also most police use the same encryption as the taxi companies. None. Anybody can listen in. <br /><br />Lastly; on the subject of MG and WU, apart from their exorbitant fees, I&#039;ve read that the forms they have you fill out are specially treated paper such that it&#039;s super easy to leave prints. Has anybody else heard this? In any case, when filling out app forms, always use gloves.<br /><br />-- Paranoid Pine

				Alright guys, here&#039;s proof that this deuchnozzle was doing it for fame/traffic. Straight from his own mouth, talking to a presumed Australian reporter. Listen to the pure naivite in this guy&#039;s writing. And the &quot;reporter&quot; (?) too. LOL Straight from the comments section about 4 hours ago.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EileyOrmsby yesterday<br /><br />I hardly think my (Australian) article you linked to was &#039;sounding the alarm&#039;. It was a balanced look at Silk Road in the context of the call for reform to the so-called &#039;War on Drugs&#039;.<br /><br />I&#039;ve since written several articles on Silk Road (including one on the greatest disappearance of all - that of Tony76, with an estimated $100-250K of users&#039; money) - see my blog All Things Vice for another angle to the Silk Road story.<br /><br />(not sure if links are allowed: [allthingsvice.wordpress.com])<br /><br />3 replies to EileyOrmsby<br />[Adrian Chen]<br />Adrian Chen 4 hours ago<br /><br />Ah, wish I had seen that before I wrote the article. I was just reading about Tony76 in the forums today, actually.<br /><br />I do agree scammers are going to become a much bigger problem as Silk Road blows up (even more than it already is.) But I find it hard to believe that at some point one of the admins or higher-ups aren&#039;t busted and that brings the whole thing down. As we saw with Anonymous and LulzSec, these guys might talk big game but they often have pretty shoddy OpSec.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				also for the record I don&#039;t really care if everyone shits on me but the reason I made this thread was to point out that there was a new article from one of the first news sources to publicize SR. I found it of interest and apparently I&#039;m not the only one. I wasn&#039;t aware that DPR hadn&#039;t stopped posting because I don&#039;t frequent the forum all that much but I should have checked that, sorry.

				This article doesn&#039;t even propose any new information.<br /><br />It&#039;s just rehashing things we&#039;ve known for ages in a sensationalist way.<br /><br />And then at the end, he tries to bash SR for the paranoia that he himself is helping to perpetuate.<br /><br />Classy move there Adrian, you really are a good reporter. What a great, great, article. <br /><br />&quot;And these lateset ripples probably are just another wave of unfounded paranoia that sweeps periodically through this dark corner of the web, fueled by the mind-bending substances traded there and the anonymity that makes the whole thing possible.

				If anyone is still trying to read the article from a browser that blocks scripting, try pasting the address (www.gawker.com/ 5926440/ are-authorities-closing-in-on-the-online-drug-market-silk-road) into the Firefox search bar on the upper right. It should be set to use Startpage if you are using the TBB. Once on the results page, simply click the &quot;View by Ixquick Proxy&quot; link below the appropriate result.<br /><br />As for the article, I just don&#039;t see how the author came to the conclusion he did. What exactly made him think that the feds are &quot;closing in&quot; on anything? I don&#039;t see one shred of evidence in that article, other than some rumor from MDMA dealers that was going around for months already. Look, we all know that every relevant federal law enforcement agency is investigating this place. They&#039;ve already busted buyers and vendors (same goes internationally), and as far as I know, that&#039;s what they will keep doing for a while. It&#039;s possible that some day, they will try to completely take down SR, but not until they bust a shitload of users first.<br /><br />Either this author has real intel from some confidential source that he can&#039;t even mention, or he is basically assuming that, like, it&#039;s been a year since the last article, and by now the cops tooootally should be on Silk Road&#039;s ASS, brahh. In case of the former, I doubt he&#039;d risk tipping SR off to a huge investigation that penetrated it all the way to the top, even in there was no classified information being revealed in said vague article. Like someone else said, it&#039;s not like Gawker is Reuters or the New York Times. I doubt the author wants to risk being investigated himself, publicity be damned.<br /><br />Assuming this article is just baseless sensationalism, it&#039;s probably a good thing. We should all assume that SR has been a fed honeypot this whole time. Don&#039;t get too personal with anyone and PGP everything! Don&#039;t tell anyone about Silk Road anywhere under any circumstances, and certainly not over any piece of technology such as a cell phone. Don&#039;t write anything down involving SR; keep all notes encrypted. Last but not least, completely destroy all SR-related packaging material. Don&#039;t wait until you have a reason to be secure, because then it will be too late.

For example, if you read the newspapers and information points in deus ex, you&#039;ll notice several predictions have actually gone from fiction to fact since the game was published, and not in a vague general way either.

The author claims that SR is being targeted and being closed in on by law enforcement agencies because of the few threads/posts that state that SR is under LE control and that DPR went MIA. Its all bullshit, DPR came back and replied on threads day before yesterday and so.

				The article sums up random speculations that have been posted since i joined SR and most likely long before that too.<br />Anyway, even if it was true I wouldn&#039;t care.<br /><br />PGP will protect me, and I&#039;ve taken greater risks IRL to get high.<br />No matter what rumors appear, people will continue to use SR no matter how risky it is because it&#039;s still the safest way to do business.

You do the stories the publisher wants/allows you to do. There are tons of (especially the young and motivated) journalists who would love to do the investigative stories, but aren&#039;t allowed to. The papers they work for can pretty much destroy their career, if they don&#039;t behave. <br /><br />Also there&#039;s a famous example in the USA, Christopher Hidgens, former Editor of the New York Times. He compiled a shitload of evidence that the reasons for the Iraq-war were not legit (*before* the war). He wasn&#039;t allowed to go forward with his story, so he quit the NYT(!). When asked about his opinion about the NYT and if he considers it a quality news-source (in a 2hr cspan interview) he said something like: &quot;Yes, the stories they do are of high quality. But that isn&#039;t the issue. The problem is not what they report, but what they decide to NOT report.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh yeah. There&#039;s no question. I was watching an interview of Michael Hastings on TyT, the rolling stone reporter that embedded himself with McChrystal in Afghanistan and got the general fired for insubordinate comments of the CiC in &#039;10. He was discussing his time at newsweek from &#039;00-06 and how a story like his rs article would have been buried and neutered in a rag like newsweek. Instead of a responsibility of reporting facts to their readers, chief editors like Jon Meacham are chosen because of their commitment to feeding the myth of American exceptionalism, having swallowed the myth whole themselves and proven their toolness to their corporate masters. Doesn&#039;t matter if the MSM rag is left, right, or center ... their executive editors all share this trait as a req of the job. This fit in perfectly with Chomsky&#039;s MUST READ Manufacturing Consent and the chapter on media filters written prior to the birth of the internet but just as valid today on how media filters are implemented that affects public perception and limits choices. Great stuff in understanding the nuance of effective propaganda at present.

He seems content to surf on the fumes of past notoriety with his rather baseless and poorly researched update.<br /><br />I guess what your grandma didn&#039;t take into account is that &quot;you&quot; in this case is the spectacle of the Elephant Man.

Heroin definitely wont aid in the robbing of banks or running over your enemies too, in fact it&#039;d be quite detrimental to either of those actions. So really, why all they Hype about the Heroin?

				Multiculturalism is the cause of racism. Thats why most people won`t have the balls to say &#039;hey, you`re black&#039; or use the word &#039;nigger&#039; publicly in the presence of black people. Thats why some people will use it against you, claiming your being racist and so on for using those terms/stereotypes. These terms have no meaning at all, and the only people giving it a meaning are people who are all hushed up about it. The slave owners didn`t call their slaves niggers because they had immense hatred, its because that is the term they labeled them with. Even people who were nice to slaves/set them free called them nigger. Its absolutely ridiculous. So a black man can call someone a cracker and the dude being called that can`t say the other is a nigger? Thats retarded, and I frankly don`t know why I even bothered explaining it. I`m asian.&nbsp; ::) They called asians yellows because they had a tint of yellow, not because they hated them, just like they called the Indians &#039;red-people&#039;.

Who the fuck gets offended from being called a cracker? &#039;Nigger&#039; might have been the common term to refer to blacks during slavery, but it evolved into something far more ugly because it was used during this period when they were treated and subjugated as an inferior race. As a minority, you really should know better. Even if you personally don&#039;t mind being called a chink or a gook, there are plenty of your ethnicity with a little more dignity that think otherwise.

Human history can be mapped out by one group of people kicking-fuck out of another group of people and coming off handsome for it. Look at the Greeks, Romans, Angevin Empire, Holy Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire, British Empire, Spanish Empire, Portuguese Empire, and look what the Americans did to the Native Americans. It&#039;s obviously shit but come on, this is just what Homo-Sapiens do and it&#039;s just our way of competing with each other the same way that animals do in the wild. The difference is that we have added abstract thought into the mix. <br /><br />Possibly the darkest example is if you look at how World War 2 pushed medical and technological advancements far faster than what it would in times of peace. I&#039;m not saying that World War 2 was a good thing but you can&#039;t deny that it pushed advancements that would not have occurred in that time if it didn&#039;t happen.

Seriously?<br /><br />You sound really ignorant of the historical context of epithets used to demean a different race, paint them as the &#039;other&#039;, and cast them as less than human; subhuman savages no better than barbaric animals in the case of &#039;nigger&#039;. Whereas the word &quot;cracker&quot; has never been used at any point in history to subjugate those with fair skin as an inferior race. Who the fuck gets offended from being called a cracker? &#039;Nigger&#039; might have been the common term to refer to blacks during slavery, but it evolved into something far more ugly because it was used during this period when they were treated and subjugated as an inferior race. As a minority, you really should know better. Even if you personally don&#039;t mind being called a chink or a gook, there are plenty of your ethnicity with a little more dignity that think otherwise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, you know why? Because that term is a joke. The only places where all these terms are felt to be demeaning are the UK/US. You can come to my country and call anyone chink/good, they`ll just walk away. You can even directly tell them what you mean, they`ll still walk away. They`re smart enough to know that those terms don`t apply to them regardless of their history or such. I`m not ignorant, YOUR ignorant for not realizing that we`re in the 21st century where all of these terms don`t mean shit, other than identifying a race. You know I had black friends, and they were ok with people addressing them as nigger, you know why? because they identify with that term. They even use it themselves to call friends of the same race, but they don`t limit themselves to that. They even call me nigger saying, &#039;whats up my nigger&#039;. The term has evolved and become a socially acceptable word, and the only people still offended by it are people like you who think it should be hushed up due to historical contexts of it. And who the fuck are you to say no one gets offended by saying cracker? You`re being one-sided and no white kid or guy would like to be called that in a jeery way right?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31093.msg366168#msg366168">Quote from: jpinkman on July 24, 2012, 02:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As a minority, you really should know better.

If anything the Asian population is the biggest of all races in terms of numbers. Just because they are a minority in America/UK, doesn`t mean what you said applies for Asians all over the world. Nigger, chink, cracker/etc are all terms that are by the general public in the US/UK/etc are deemed inappropriate, and frankly its people like you who prolong its non-existent meaning.&nbsp; This is 2012, not 16-1900s. I can`t even believe what you even said. I`m more shocked that you assumed Asians are a minority, and that I naturally should &#039;know better&#039;. If anything thats more offensive to me than being called Chink/gook or whatever term you can think of.

				They&#039;re always having this fight on Gawker and now it&#039;s here. Must be lots of Gawker commenters on here. Something I never liked about Gawker is there were always a bunch of people self righteously offended about this and that but the upshot always struck me as an attempt to control others. &quot;I&#039;m so right and you&#039;re so wrong so comply with my orders now.&quot; I find this aspect of people as troubling as all the nasty things people say about each other. Yeah, people aren&#039;t really all that nice as a group. That&#039;s why this site is cool. We can do what we can for ourselves and just hope that we are left in peace to do it.
