				Does anyone have any experience buying addies from a reputable website? I&#039;ve recently realized how wonderful they are, but they&#039;re ridiculously overpriced here on the road =(&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated. (i&#039;m located in the states)

				Waay before SR I tried various Websites to Buy Hydros, Speed and Oxys...same thing over and over..Sent in Money via Western Union and never received anything. This was to the tune of nearly $1,000 bucks. Point being that your right it&#039;s more expensive on SR, but Odds are in your favor you&#039;ll get something for your money. So it&#039;s your choice...gamble to supposedly get cheaper drugs from a Website or pay a Premium and get your stuff for real.<br /><br />oppy

				My buddy has a script of 120 a month for 20MG IR&#039;s, i&#039;ve been seriously considering buying his stock and offering them for sale on here for a very competitive price, but am hesitant to do this simply due to the need for a vacuum sealer, supplies and the $ for the vendor account...im about to start a thread about the matter and offer prices...if there is enoughinterest, I&#039;ll probably do it.

				One online pharmacy I use stocks adderall, but it has received mixed reviews in a couple of the online pharmacy discussion forums.&nbsp; Curious to find out for myself, I ordered a few on top of another order i was already placing.<br /><br />What i received was a chalky pill stamped AD on one side 30 on the other that crumbled easily and def wasnt The Real Thing (I think it was ephedrine based on the effect).<br /><br />If you dont want to pay SR prices, my suggestion would be to make some new ADHD friends, or look for a source based in the USA (like an e-mail vendor). Its trial and error until you find a good source.
