				It&#039;s too popular and brazenly illegal. Two US senators have added the persecution (err, prosecution) of SR and it&#039;s users to their [campaign] crusade. It&#039;s only a matter of time before people will be publicly crucified; heads on spears will be placed throughout the media. At first it will probably be the bumblers and a few unfortunates who get skinned alive. The web site might get attacked or worse, cracked. Later, the Tor network might be compromised if the NSA / cyber-warfare guys are commissioned to demonstrate their usefulness.

				SR is the only place i shop (i&#039;m sure I&#039;m gonna get my SR card in the mail soon... Like a costco card, but totally imaginary!) but i&#039;ve looked around BMReloaded... It&#039;s like the Khyber pass only non-muslims are allowed! Not as many vendors and only 30% of the illicit drug sellection, but a viable option if you&#039;re after a different atmosphere!<br />&nbsp;<br />If SR did shut down I think it&#039;d be about 30 seconds before the mega geeks got another place up and operating! They&#039;ve probably already built it on contingency... I would!

				Another possibility is the SR honchos could be discovered through conventional means and recruited/replaced. The market might be allowed to continue to function so that people could be identified, monitored and persecuted as needed.

				Chin up people!&nbsp; In June 2011, the UN Global Commission charged with investigating drug policies declared the war on drugs a &quot;complete failure,&quot; largely blaming the United States.&nbsp; The pendulum is swinging the other way.&nbsp; Global usage of cocaine, opiates, and Canny are up high amounts since 2008.&nbsp; The severe punishments and criminals associated with them are going to decline.&nbsp;

				Sorry to be a buzz-kill but the power of positive thinking might not actually do much to stave off the boogieman in this case. Friendliness and loyalty is much appreciated as is personal morality and a sense of justice but I think it is a mistake to assume that because you are a good person and not really doing anything bad that you will not be targeted, tortured and destroyed. The opposition is not personal or even rational, it is a blind mindless system of corporate profits, politician status, government authority, etc. Sorry.

				I don&#039;t know if it is consciously acknowledged by the Establishment but a [possibly legitimate] concern is that virtually no one is inherently competent to manipulate their motivation system by exploiting the various chemical loopholes of their nervous/endocrine system. Those who do not burn their spirit to the ground or tie it up in knots probably become quite unique - that is to say, not easily manipulated and pretty much on their own.

				[Seriously off topic but] you may be under-thinking it. An unmotivated or motivationally damaged person is pretty much useless (or worse). People in general, if pushed or bullied can become passive-aggressive saboteurs, they&#039;re slow, they break things, they hurt themselves (what I call mad Gilligan syndrome) and in extreme cases will just sit down and die.<br /><br />Back on topic, I think experimentation with drugs is dangerous and exploration should only be undertaken with training and support. Even under these favorable conditions, I think most explorers will be damaged in some way, possibly mutilated. It shouldn&#039;t be done in public view.

IMO they are the ones we really need to worry about the most. They don&#039;t like competition to spirituality, because they have merged it together with a political power structure and at the higher levels they are able to use it to manipulate people like their puppets. Of course other people get high on the concept of their nations society being a single collective entity / organism, and they are just as dangerous because they don&#039;t care at all about individuals only the good of the swarm.<br /><br />These are the two political philosophies fighting for control of the USA, and neither of them like drugs for their own reasons. The Religious People don&#039;t like them because they are told not to like them by their spiritual leaders, and their spiritual leaders do not like them because they can offer competition and mind expansion. The Swarm does not like drugs because they can decrease worker effectiveness and since The Swarm thinks everyones resources are everyones resources, they want to make sure that Bob doesn&#039;t as an individual do things that could potentially take away from what he can contribute to The Swarm. <br /><br />Both also enjoy free slave labor and huge amounts of both of them have jobs only because drugs are illegal. The Religious People like this because they can use the court system to indoctrinate people toward their religion (ie: force them to go to religious meetings like AA, and many other things like this) and The Swarm likes this because they create a huge amount of jobs for The Swarm. <br /><br />In USA the first faction call themselves Republicans and the second faction call themselves Democrats. <br />

There are two things that I take into consideration. First, SR is pretty near the pinnacle of security when it comes to cyber crime. Tor hidden service, Bitcoin with mixing sort of built in and highly suggested, GPG highly suggested, probably a somewhat hardened server, many people using hardened linux distros, etc. Most cyber crime groups are not using anywhere near the security we are, they are picking up wires with fake ID&#039;s, using web proxies or VPNs, trusting safe-mail to keep their communications encrypted, using non-hidden servers and everyone on windows etc. And those are the people who are actually better than average when it comes down to it. The only people I see using better security than is suggested and partially enforced on SR, are super l33t hackers with botnets bigger than Tor is who are also well versed with crypto, programming and computer security concepts, and intelligence agencies (and usually there is significant overlap between them and the super l33t hackers).<br /><br />Even if you think of mail traffick groups who are not on the internet our security pwns them, most of them are not using vac seals at all (instead using strong cover scents) and they generally package shit in such a way that it fits the profile used to look for drug mail. <br /><br />So compared to everyone else our security and protocols are really pretty high end. Why would the feds encourage that? Not to mention SR can&#039;t break GPG or trace Tor or mixed bitcoins etc anymore than anyone else can....<br /><br />which brings me to my next point.<br /><br />The technology we are using really isn&#039;t enough to prevent someone who really knows what they are doing to fuck us, especially if they have some money to throw at it. Tor hidden services can be traced fairly easily, even Tor clients can be traced pretty damn fast by an attacker who has 50 entry guards (what was it, 11% chance of not being deanonymized after one year, if the attacker can watch the end point and they own 50 entry guards?) I mean there are a lot of methods for seriously hurting the anonymity provided by Tor. Even if people are using open/cracked WiFi + Tor (which I highly doubt many do) there are a lot of potential ways to narrow in on a person using open WiFi that they would need to be protecting themselves from. <br /><br />GPG is great encryption, but it doesn&#039;t prevent you from being hacked and having your plaintexts/private keys stolen. And even though many people here are using above average computer security (linux distros, security oriented linux distros, isolation techniques, etc) a lot are still not. And nobody here is using cutting edge computer security techniques I doubt more than 1% of people here have ever written a mandatory access control profile and probably nobody or very close to nobody here is using physical hardware isolation for Tor/firefox or air gaps for encryption. Plus even if you don&#039;t look at the computer security component, an open market is pretty easy to nym flood with human-intelligence-bots for address harvesting. <br /><br />So in the end I doubt SR is run by LE, but I also doubt it could withstand them if they had the slightest clue what the fuck they were doing. If they have some Tor zero day and have managed to pwn 150k+ people it would be a pretty epic operation, and really it is not out of the realm of possibility.
