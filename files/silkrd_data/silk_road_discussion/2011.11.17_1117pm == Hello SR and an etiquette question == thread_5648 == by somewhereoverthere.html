				Hello Silk Road community, I&#039;m quite pleased to be here! I have a question regarding communication etiquette using the SR messaging system. When sending a message to a vendor, is it expected and/or understood that said message ought to be encrypted using the vendor&#039;s public key, even if it doesn&#039;t contain any &quot;sensitive&quot; information (addresses or transaction specifics for example?) I imagine different people will have different tolerances regarding privacy, but don&#039;t know what the accepted standard is. My gut says encrypt everything, but I don&#039;t want to create additional hassle around casual messaging. Thanks for your help!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Somewhereoverthere

				I don&#039;t mind either way, and prefer to err on the side of caution (and therefore use PGP). Then again I&#039;m not a high volume vendor so I have time that others don&#039;t. <br /><br />I&#039;d say check their profile for an indication for one way or the other. If they&#039;re in the top 30 (arbitrary number) they&#039;re probably really busy and would save them time if it&#039;s just a regular inquiry. <br /><br />Most vendors are very accommodating and would communicate with you in the way that you prefer.&nbsp;

				I do not require it. I offer my public key for those that want to use it. It really is a good idea to use encryption with anything that could be incriminating but it is up to the buyer&#039;s discretion. I always respond to inquiries in the same fashion that they are delivered. If someone uses pgp to message me, I use it to reply if I have a key for that user. If someone messages in plain text, I respond in kind. Most vendors that do require it will say so in their profile page. Generally it is a good idea to check there before messaging a vendor.

				Thanks for the replies and advice, I&#039;m learning the ropes. I&#039;ve noticed that some people don&#039;t specify a preference in their profiles, but since the PGP key is there, why not go ahead and use it, eh?<br /><br />Regards to all.

				^^^agree with that from personal experience. I was using pgp even for basic questions and one vendor came back in simple text and said it&#039;s a pain in the ass which I can see because if his key is like mine then it&#039;s fucking loooonnggg and not easy to type or remember. So I would use encryption for things like giving out your address for shipping and other things as already stated above. I think it&#039;s better to use that method and if a vendor wants everything encrypted they&#039;ll let you know.
