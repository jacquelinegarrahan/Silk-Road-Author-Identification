I was sending some bitcoins directly to another site user and if I did XX.1 it would say insufficient funds, but if I just did XX.00, then it worked fine.

				This is because 0.01 bitcoins or something are taken as payment for the transfer, thats probably why you couldnt transfer all of your bitcoins.&nbsp; Also, it takes 6 confirmations for the bitcoins to show up in your wallet, th, sr or w/e.&nbsp; This usually takes 30min- 1 hour.
