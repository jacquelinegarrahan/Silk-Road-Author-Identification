				ALARM BELLS&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)<br />Started ringing when i got this so i was going to delete but i thought for some weird reason not to so reread it a few times, then i tried to play along and try get more info but the fucker is worse than a blue arsed fly, one subject then another trying to divert..&nbsp; Heads up people.<br /><br />And any new vendors reading DONT EVER DO ANYTHING OUT SIDE OF TOR!.<br /><br />As this person is trying to accomplish, by suggesting no escrow use skype or meet up, what the fuck?.<br />I&#039;m dumb when it comes to makin a website ect <br /><br />but not so dumb to come here vend and fall for crap like this. <br /><br />So Mr,&nbsp; &nbsp;at first i was sellin a black mother fucking credit card to a BTC MINER, and dying for a reply here ya go.<br /><br />Its now on the forums CHEERS.<br /><br />&nbsp;:o<br /><br />brickstobricks&nbsp; &nbsp; um... okay then? bye&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 day&nbsp; &nbsp; read<br />&nbsp;<br />UK Stealth(97)&nbsp; &nbsp; lmfao go fucking stuff ur dick in a blender.&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 day&nbsp; &nbsp; read<br /><br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey man I need to know asap what you want to do. I have a few people interested. if that price was too high let me know and I can possibly work something out. But I can really afford to wait around brotha &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 were from batch 1, 4 were from batch 2. so 6 are the silver ones and 4 are the black. They run 74 overclocked and I can show you how to do this or 69-72 gh not overclocked. People are selling these for over 25,000. I&#039;m not a jackass. I know I payed 1300 apiece for the first 6 and a little over 3000 apiece for the other 4. I&#039;m not going to charge some extreme price. And if you buy all ten I will definitely cut you a deal. Now yes I know there are many scams with these units but I can post pictures, skype, whatever is needed to prove. Only problem is I can&#039;t and will not allow escrow on these. Easy way to get ripped. I would go through all the trouble of meeting you in person before I allow escrow on these babies. and hopefully you understand why. Running all 10 units gets you 700,000 mh. sadly the bitcoin difficulty just went up today... a big jump. But there is still room for profit. If you buy all 10, you can have them for 15,000 straight up. you can pick them up, play for me to fly down, or I&#039;ll ship all with tracking. 150,000 for 10 avalon miners is a hell of a deal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />UK Stealth(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;info on miners &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sounds good man. but im confused, do you want the card or the miners? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />UK Stealth(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yer course il buy but you need to come up with a beeter plan than these few messages, if you get my drift i have been scammed before so not gonna let it happen again, no matter how much your plan says buy it. so send me more info i have to go away for the weekend will be back on monday should give you enough time. regards uk stealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can overclock anything brotha. and the business world is fucked up. i use to praise my job. turns out they were a peice of shit. i was up and pretty high ranked. two people below me hated me out of jealousy. pretty much i was framed for stealing money.... I never ever ever did shit like this. wouldnt even consider it. had to do 2 and a half years in the system and have a record. cant ever get a job. so when I got out bitcoin was still cheap and that became my way of making it man. I love it though. I hooked up machines and generated money. no job, no nothing. fucking up there systems meaning doing this card stuff. Ive been running them for 2 years. yet to get caught. me, and my 2 buddys i grew up with. and decisions on what? you want to get stuff from me? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />UK Stealth(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kewl but you confused me here, Avalon is with out a doubt the way to go, not sure how you managed to overclok em though, apart from that, can you explain more about this you wrote.<br /><br />but i work with bank of america for about 17 years and stopped after i got into a pretty big dispute. ever since then ive been into bitcoin and fucking their system up. how you mean fucking there system up, IM all for that as they TOOK my home a couple years ago, when they was all jetting off into the sunset :(.<br /><br />Please give me more info so i can start making more informed decisions.<br /><br />Respect UK Stealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ha thats true. im a dumbass for even thinking this would work! and im a miner. nerdy type guy lol. and everything is avalon. butterfly is shit. yet to get my stuff. 10 avalon. 8 of them can be overclocked to 74gh. but when you normally run them they get 69-72 gh. those we could skype and even meet in person. its nothing illegal ha. but i work with bank of america for about 17 years and stopped after i got into a pretty big dispute. ever since then ive been into bitcoin and fucking their system up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ha thats true. im a dumbass for even thinking this would work! and im a miner. nerdy type guy lol. and everything is avalon. butterfly is shit. yet to get my stuff. 10 avalon. 8 of them can be overclocked to 74gh. but when you normally run them they get 69-72 gh. those we could skype and even meet in person. its nothing illegal ha. but i work with bank of america for about 17 years and stopped after i got into a pretty big dispute. ever since then ive been into bitcoin and fucking their system up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />UK Stealth(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dude this is the black market no one is honest, thats why i have NO REFUND on some stuff and postal options, as they will still try by any means to BYPASS payment.! UK Stealth.<br /><br />BTW you went from talking about black bank credit cards to bit coin miners, Avalon makes or better?. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know anyone that might want to buy some asic miners? all get 71-74 ghs. have 10 in total and will let them go cheap. tell them to hmu if so &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thiss is true. I don&#039;t know how else to sell them... might be better off producing the cards for myself and buying then resaling bitcoin. have to give that some thought. Forgot that not everyone will be honest ha... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />UK Stealth(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my point would be no one will rick that amount of money on them facts, and what if the person u sold to claims it dont work. Then waht you think SR Support will let you keep the money?, what if they did not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ha this is a hell of a deal for anyone. this was how I purchased my bitcoin miners and everyhting. i dont have to persuade you. take it or leave it ha. im not even asking people to send coins first. I send with tracking and once it there and you test it then you release. as long as you dont do stupid shit with the card you will be fine.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />&nbsp;<br />UK Stealth(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would any sane minded person would dare to part with what your asking for on the premise that you apparently worked in a bank, ect.<br /><br />High end cards are not all black as you suggest many corps use different colours ect.<br /><br />I would suggest you refrain from doing stuff like this in house messaging to sell, dont work with vendors and you will eventually get reported.<br />I suggest you decease this practice... UK Stealth.<br /><br />On the other hand if you can provide legit access to atm admin control panels i might consider something.<br />&nbsp;<br />brickstobricks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don&#039;t know what a black card is then this isnt for you. For those that do know what a black card is, you know its crazy. A credit card with no limits.... thats what everyone wants. I use to work for bank of america in this field with high bank customers. I have a hack into the system and a few dirty workers in the bank that issue this cards. Lifespan of this card is about 6-8 months before it become aware to bank of america. You can buy anything and everything. I made an account today and I&#039;m going to start selling these cards. 15k for 1, 25k for 2. You can only buy a max of two. sorry. If you would be interested let me know. I mainly use this to purchase bitcoins from people. dirty but hey, makes me rich. I have a few cards now that I&#039;m willing to ship out and everything. p.s all cards have been fully tested and work. will even skype you to show you the physical card and me using it. great for buying prepaid phone mins, electronics, bitcoins, anything. charge it up

				ok so he started of trying to sell a black credit card(only the type the rich can afford), then he goes on to try and sell the new Bitcoin Mining machines by Avalon, which (aint been released yet or no one can get them).<br /><br />In five or so messages. <br /><br />LOL definitely a scam attempt and considering he/she wants it all out of escrow... <br /><br />I see why you posted this but Mr UK Stealth you should of worded it better, took me about 20 mins to figure out its a copy of messages. Ty anyways.
