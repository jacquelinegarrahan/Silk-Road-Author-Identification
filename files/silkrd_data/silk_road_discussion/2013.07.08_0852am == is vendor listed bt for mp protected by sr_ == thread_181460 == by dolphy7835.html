				Is it protected and how, because i thought that the address field where i heard is where your suppose to put your mp number in is supposed to be deleted as soon as marked in transit. How then does sr have proof of transaction even taking place if vendor takes your money with no returns? I am thinking of going through a vendor for this, but don&#039;t wanna get fucked. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks

				I just looked on wiki under buyers guide and SR clearly states that they don&#039;t cover those types of exchanges. Then why allow a vendor to have option to post it on his vendor page?

				Watch your ass with MP vendors!Fake feedback is easy and cheap to make with $0.00 listings.I think 90% of BTC vendors are scammers.I have used vicious86,Jumbomonkeybiscuit,and sugermama before she left(not sugarmama BTC).We need BTC escrow like some other drug sites have.I do not understand why SR does not implement all the great suggestion everyone has made.SR makes alot of money on any purchase scam or no scam(not sure about $0.00 BTC listings).I would think they lose money in the long run considering all those potential long term customers that turn their backs after getting ripped off.Peace :)
