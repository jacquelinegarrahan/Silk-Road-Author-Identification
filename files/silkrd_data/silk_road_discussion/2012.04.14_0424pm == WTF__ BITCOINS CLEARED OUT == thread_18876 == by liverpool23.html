Thats why you should keep the real link book-marked, and never follow the links from the hidden wiki. <br /><br />Basically keep your computer secure, and make sure the URL is correct when you login here. Nothing for you to worry about

				The new URL is pretty easy to remember. A glance at the URL bar before you type your information in will keep you safe. <br /><br />There is also a list of known phishing sites on the Hidden Wiki - http://7jguhsfwruviatqe.onion/index.php/Main_Page#Phishing_Sites

				Its best to copy and paste the url and save it so when you have to reload tor you wont have to go find it again. Also, try to memorize most of it. its pretty easy now....I cant believe that phishers are still able to do this crap..Thats why another good thing is to not keep a lot of&nbsp; btc on SR, keep it on your computer wallet or whatever, it can take a few hours to transfer but another safety tool...

				Look up<br />Black hole exploit kit<br />Spyeye<br />Zeus<br />Pickpocket Botnet<br /><br />and the hundreds of other backdoors that keylog everything you do. They can simply collect all your keystrokes logging into here and just cash out later. Good reason to never use windows.<br /><br />

				On the top of the Silk Road marketplace, there&#039;s a link that says &quot;account&quot;. Click on that, and scroll down. You will see a grey bar that says &quot;action, notes, amount, balance, and date&quot;. That is your transaction history. You should be able to see where your coins went.

				7ibcuoqkz7hi2oim.onion is a phisher that after you log in it tells you that your PIN has expired and needs to be reset it asks for old PIN new PIN and repeat new PIN but it does not have your username in the top right and it doesnt show how many bitcoin you have in acount I know this is the one you logd in to and i know you are also jatisati<br />and i know budz42 ship address and i track one of his orders in tor to flag him.
