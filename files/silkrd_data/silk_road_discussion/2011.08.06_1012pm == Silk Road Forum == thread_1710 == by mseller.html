				Ok, I do not like how this forum is expanding. All this venture is very private and sensitive issue and nobody if is not buyer/vendor should stick his nose into.<br />Behave like on the street. Do you stay behind after making a drug deal and chit-chat with your dealer and friend. That that conversation is constructed about every single detail!!<br />Come on guys - do not fool yourself what this is about. Be quiet. This is not a place to ask where you can buy btc, or to hear a book how 3jane product works!!<br />I am afraid that all this if continue to expand like this will attract to many attention and go to hell.

				I agree that we all should be careful on whats said. However, I had no idea how to get pgp going installed until someone helped me here in the forums. I also, had no idea how the btc worked and where to start. So, if it weren&#039;t for the forum, I would have bagged SR altogether.<br /><br />We do need to be careful on what is said here or at least have links i.e learn pgp here (insert site), want to learn more about bitcoin go here (insert site)<br /><br />There has to be a happy medium or why even have a forum?<br /><br />But mseller has a point. We should not get too comfortable about talking about anything specific. It should be kept simple and to the point.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t vote because I didn&#039;t agree with either of the 2 choices. To me it read. 1. dont talk at all or 2. just talk to you particular vendor. if thats the case, then we should just use the pm function on the market. Now if there was a 3rd choice, like. 3. keep it simple, to the point and dont reveal too much info, then i would vote for that...

				It&#039;s not my poll. It&#039;s msellers. I was just giving my 02 cents. I was saying that when posting, we (as in everyone) should be careful and think twice. Its really common sense. Dont give out locations. packaging patterns, names, etc.<br /><br />What I think mseller is saying is not to get too friendly here. our guard might be let down and we wont even realize it has. I&#039;ve looked at posts that I have made and changed them. Ill have to let mseller explain it more, since its his thread. Im just speculating on what hes trying to say.<br /><br />I think the forum is important. I think its helped a lot of people. Granted, LEO is here, we know this. so, when I write a thread or respond to a post, I now pretend im wrting it to a LE. Or ask myself, &quot;is there any info here that could endanger me or anyone else?&quot; if so, I dont post it. <br /><br />Im sure Mseller will clarify himself..

				I agree with CP&#039;s 1st post. But I also agree with mseller&#039;s sentiments. <br /><br />It&#039;s tough...but BTC alone in and of itself is tough to figure out for someone just jumping in. Have you ever posted a question on the bitcoin forum? You&#039;re lucky if they don&#039;t give you the opposite advice you&#039;re seeking. The members at SR are amazingly able and willing to help each other out because we were all beginners at one time.&nbsp; People need help, and for that matter so does the bitcoin, and this place provides that help at least somewhat. Same for pgp, encryption, receiving, shipping etc..<br /><br />But then again it also serves as a road map for LE. But overall I guess I&#039;m for less restriction not more. I&#039;m torn so I didn&#039;t vote.

				There is NO third option, that I mean what I put only 2. Third is useless.<br />On EVERY post no matter what you say - you are exposing yourself.<br />I am NOT afraid for individuals, I am afraid that some jurnalist or somebody LE connected who hate all this will alarm many people who will find a way to shoot this down.<br />Forum is neccesary but no in this volume.<br />In this forum is visible how many buys are going on, transactions, forum members, that ALL can attract unwanted atention.<br />Am I exagurate a bit, maybe, but I dont like see debating here with what, how much, where, quality, amounts to be OPEN.<br />Deal buyer-vendor IS a private sensitive highly illegal issue what is NOT open to discussion - not on &quot;open&quot; forum!<br />This forum attract more attention then SR, count on it!<br />I searched other hidden services, child porn really made me sick, but there is not visible so many &quot;behind a scene&quot; things like here. You can imagine but that is all.<br />Like me with child porn there are many &quot;connected&quot; people who will do anything to stop this. And so much trafic what this forum have I really think that we should think little &quot;outside a box&quot;.

				Both. Even nobody can control everything I think that every individual should think from buyers/vendor/LE/outsider perspective BEFORE positing.<br />OFF TOPIC sub forum - is not necessary<br />casual chit-chat, mostly out of boredome or human nature to communicate - its not necessary.<br />Every topic what can be found on bluelight, ophiohile, btcforum, pgpforum - is not necessary.<br />-deleted<br />For such topics, there are million places to find information.

				The whole purpose of &quot;drug safety&quot; (It should be called Harm reduction) is intended for products listed here and the specific products from vendors. Its not to replace any of those forums. I always suggest people go to those other sites first, but this way, a buyer can post a question regarding the exact dosage of a particular product that a vendor is selling.. <br /><br />Also, harm reduction isn&#039;t a priority on LE list. IF anything, they should welcome it. what if someone were to die because of something they ingested from this site? which would you rather have? or which would gain more notoriety? If someone posts, &quot;dont iv its dangerous?&quot; or the next gawker article is about how 10 teenagers died of a fentyanyl overdose?<br /><br />I think it protects more than anything.. Everyone is going to have a different opinion but, we all have the choice of not posting.

				I am with you CP on that. Harm reduction should be fine. Still for speciality bul products on item description should be described all reagrding dosage and method of administration.<br />All other products are them same like on those outside forums (pharmaceuticals).<br />But overall, I agree on Drug Safety (Harm reduction) with you CP so I will remove that point from my post.

				Once suitable guidelines are suggested about what shouldn&#039;t be posted about i think it&#039;s the individual&#039;s problem if they self-incriminate and mods should only step in if what someone posts could incriminate another member.

We should write strict rules and guidelines. I can not express myself like I want on english so excuse me if I was vogue.<br />We also should consider &quot;how much&quot; we post. I speak about posting just to post..casual things. That way this forum can grow in to something without order.

				I think that overall the members have done a good job keeping info off of the forum that can be used to help LE.<br /><br />The one area where I am starting to see some &quot;leakage&quot; is in the area of packing and shipping methods (including return addresses).<br /><br />LE already knows many (if not all) of the methods used by the vendors here on SR.&nbsp; The important thing is not to give them *any* info that would allow them to zero in on one vendor.&nbsp; Making remarks about how you liked the candy or how neat the object was that the product was packaged in ALL help LE know which vendors to focus in on and to start focusing on specific package types and/or packages from a particular type of sender.<br /><br />The only thing necessary to give a good review is to let people know that the packaging is &quot;excellent/professional&quot; or &quot;needs improvement/sloppy&quot;.&nbsp; Or some variation in between.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is absolutely NOT necessary is to 1. receive the product&nbsp; 2. use the product&nbsp; 3. post on the forum about how cool the packaging is, including details.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would urge every buyer to put themselves in the sellers shoes when writing a review.&nbsp; Would you put details of your own packaging on this board?&nbsp; If I was a seller and I read details on this board about my packaging, I would only have one choice: devise a new method of packaging and then make sure never to ship to the buyer who discussed it on the board.<br /><br />I know the time, effort and cost that a professional seller puts out to perfect a unique shipping method.&nbsp; Let&#039;s all respect the added value that service provides and keep it private. :)

				1. Peoples Reviews of Product and their openness on how it effects them is part of why this community is effective - you buy shit cause you know it&#039;s good.<br />2. Technical support is yet another example of this.<br />3.&nbsp; - Shipping shouldn&#039;t be discussed.<br /><br />If people decide to add a bit more info that is their prerogative, it may be detrimental to them, but that is their prerogative. Next off, more info you really think is going to lead to more attention? OVDB has bigger vendors than ours and has way WAY more personal info.&nbsp; I agree people should start thinking things through more, in a time where the conjunction of social media, facial recognition, and cloud computing means you can makes an instant profile of damn near anyone and find them in an instant. But trying to force rules as to how people post, what they are allowed to talk abut and such seems like the opposite of the freedom that is brought on by the marketplace. <br /><br />My Two Cents,<br />DigitalAlch

				I can talk about my vending venture. If you are my customer and we have finished transaction, thats it. I do not need open debate about me. That is beetween me and my customer.<br />If buyer has something to say, then he/she must ask appropiate person - that is me, sr market pm, nobody else. If there are an issuess, problems because my fault or I do not respond, that is another matter. I dont care about other vendors. I am not selling candy on SR and that will not be disscussed with everybody and outsiders. If you dont like it - leave it, your choise.
