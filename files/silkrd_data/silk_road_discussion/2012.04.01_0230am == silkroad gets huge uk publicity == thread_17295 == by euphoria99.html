				Deeply concerned about this article as mainstream media in UK have caught up first BBC now the sun, the worrying thing is the sun is the most popular newspaper in uk and there will be a lot of interest,although it will bring new clients it will also put pressure on SOCA to do something about silkroad in the UK.<br /><br />The sun http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4232399/Deadly-drugs-for-sale-in-online-universe-called-Dark-Web.html

				fffuuu-<br /><br />Nice to have a story like that come out with my shit in transit from a vendor whose product is pictured in the article.<br /><br />Putting ego aside, yeah... just another scare tactic to put complete control over everything. Eversince ISPs in the UK (maybe just 3g providers, not sure) are forced to filter all porn sites by default, I&#039;m very worried about what fucked up laws and policies they are going to implement and what technical ways they will use to enforce them.<br /><br />

				http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4232399/Deadly-drugs-for-sale-in-online-universe-called-Dark-Web.html<br />A story got printed in the sun (a big daily newspaper in the U.K.), telling the reader all about the dark web, and silkroad, without mentioning the name &#039;silkroad&#039; or &#039;tor&#039;. <br />This story took pictures directly from the site, and printed names of actual vendors. <br />Although this news is a bit scary for us, I think this is the kind of publicity that the makers of silkroad want, and can cope with, so hopefully this combined with the new lighter uk drug laws, will mean a larger selection for our uk market!<br />What do you think?

				I am also British and read the article.<br /><br />What a load of BS as you Americans would say...<br /><br />How many drug dealers on the street keep a verifiable list of all past transactions so you can see what others had to say about the quality of their product? <br /><br />The lethal nature of drugs is caused by the fact they&#039;re illegal - which as you all know forces it underground, drives up prices and leads to individual dealers selling concoctions of various strengths. The lack of accountability is far greater &quot;out there&quot; than in our Dark Universe.<br /><br />In addition, I resent the implication that all SR users are criminals. I don&#039;t touch drugs and never have but I am on here to help people invest their money in legal ventures!<br /><br />V.

				If the road is suddenly hit by the masses, as long as the programmers are confident they can keep the place secure, I dont think we would be effected very much as already established customers. <br />I just think the vendors will just end up goimg into stealth mode and everything will go alot more underground. Vendors wont take on new customers without a reference and so on.<br />Unless the governments all decide this place has to go, and they declare all out war on silkroad!<br />But of course, only time will tell!!

				Well the 9plant allowance for personal use, is planning for the heavy user that can smoke up to an ounce per week. Our new guidelines state that a plant is worth 40grams in the eyes of the law.

				Blinkrock, unfortunately, it&#039;s not as clear-cut as you have been led to believe.&nbsp; The guidelines are just that, guidelines for judges to base their decisions off.&nbsp; A judge can easily go outside them if he thinks it serves the &quot;interests of justice&quot; or some shit.<br /><br />The 9 plants = 40 grams thing isn&#039;t set in stone, and they will only use it when it is to their advantage (ie if the lab/forensic guys estimate less than that).&nbsp; There was a case recently with that Sheffield judge, who sentenced someone to jail for 6 plants.&nbsp; This happened after these new guidelines had been issued.&nbsp; There&#039;s a follow-up story here:<br /><br />https://www.uk420.com/boards/index.php?showtopic=291288<br /><br />Stay safe.

				Interesting thread. Seeing as I&#039;m stoned, I think I will wax philosophic here for a minute; if you don&#039;t want to read ranting move on...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not agree that more attention for SR is inherently a bad thing, and the reasons for this are many, but it is especially based on the idea that Tor cannot be shut down. At its heart SR is a community driven service, not unlike eBay or even craigslist. So it follows that the larger the user base, the better the competition and product diversity. However, UNLIKE eBay, SR deals exclusively in the realm of felonious material. So IRL you would want just a little corner of the spotlight, enough to attract a growing customer and vendor population (the &quot;right&quot; people), but not so much you bring the goon squad. This is what makes Tor, and by proxy SR, so great. It it can stand up to limitless attention. The whole portrayal of the &quot;dark-web&quot; as a place where your child can easily order Heroin and an assassin will never stop being attractive to bottom feeding journalists and politicians. However, the real reasons why SR or any of its clones will never be gotten rid of is vastly more exciting IMO. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some people in here have already spoken of this, but what you don&#039;t read in these stories is that a large part in why Tor works IS the governments of the world. Much of the service&#039;s intrinsic functions are hosted by computers which in one way or another are government property, like universities say. Now the powers that be could easily stop contributing to this IMO, but I think they don&#039;t for a few key reasons. They want the &quot;dark-web&quot; to thrive, because rather then shut it down they can utilize its anonymizing powers to carefully monitor the content. People are easily lulled into thinking Tor is some sort of flawless cloak-of-invisibility -- it is by no means impossible for the abc agencies of the world to nevertheless gleam info from the &quot;dark-web.&quot; Clever social engineering by thousands of agents all over the world will eventually produce real results. However, I really believe that at its core SR is constructed in an incredibly secure way, and unless you&#039;re stupid, it is very nearly impossible to be caught through it.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this point in time SR obviously represents a very small percentage of the world wide drug trade. Now that could all change, but honestly I don&#039;t think it will. Drugs have quite a long history in society, and I don&#039;t believe people will ever stop selling shit the &#039;ol fashion way -- on the corner. As long as that remains the predominant way which people score, that&#039;s where the majority negative attention will go. Tor or SR could be down tomorrow and cease to exist, but I really don&#039;t see that happening. We live in very interesting times I think. Computer networks will only become more complicated and the clandestine areas deeper. I think its fascinating to watch, especially how big brother has shifted his tactics to evolve along side it. Just read as much as you can, the technology is only your friend if you are smart enough to comprehend it -- getting tricked is easy enough for many people (a simple configuration error could be the difference between the feds kicking down your door or not). SR seems to have some very resourceful people at the helm, and I don&#039;t doubt they have what it takes to avoid the pitfalls this story will bring. Anyway, just my take on the whole thing, if anyone made it this far :D

				@UKGrower, I know the 40grams thing isn&#039;t set in stone, it&#039;s just the number that they use to put a figure on a plant. I was passing this number on to TravellingWithoutMoving just as a reference, because to be honest, I don&#039;t know how much to expect from a plant! I am doing my first crop at the moment, and I&#039;d be very happy with 40g from each of my plants :D<br />And of course they are guidelines, there can only be guidelines, but these guidelines have literally just been written, for this exact purpose. If you read the guidelines, it also states all the mitigating factors that need to be examined as well, because obviously no two cases are the same. <br />The judge in that link has made an excessive sentence, especially for someone who is using for medicinal purposes. It says in the link that there are 7 other cases at the moment in a similar position, who are all appealing against their sentence. <br />I think that the judges are still in the old frame of mind, they haven&#039;t come round to the new rules yet, but especially because these stories have some publicity, once they have been appealed I think that the sentences will be severely reduced. Whats the point of these new guidelines, if they are simply to be ignored, the law must follow their own rules, which they simply have not done in that case. <br />Whatever happens, these 8 cases are very important to the future of growing cannabis in the U.K. They are the flagship cases, which will lead the way for all the cases to follow, so fingers crossed!! hopefully they will get their sentences reduced with the appeal!!

Remember, though, it hasn&#039;t been around for a year even, and that isn&#039;t that long at all. All it&#039;s going to take is a few people acting like idiots and crossing that thin line between keeping it in private and exposing the rest of the naive world to our beautiful world of debauchery and this could all change at a moment&#039;s notice.<br /><br />

The laws are generally random and are in place simply because they are in place and there&#039;s no real interest in challenging them, no real rhyme or reason to them, just little things of significance that are picked out according to the whim of the country at that moment or what the media is saying &quot;Drugs are bad&quot; etc. <br /><br />And people trying so hard in their lives working shifts/trying to teach, they just want to read a story and the Sun happens to be a conventional narrative that they can buy in to. It isn&#039;t that the UK culture is anymore reactive than anywhere else I think that thas just said from people within that culture because they don&#039;t really understand other cultures and that the UK is NOT significant, not sophisticated because of princes/lords, in the scheme of things, just another country of ignorant, normal people that don&#039;t really care too much about anything important but read the Sun to have an opinion and to feel like their life is meaningful.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with that really other than it stops other people living their lives and just makes shit confusing and pointless when there are so many mixed messages in the media (Drugs are bad is a common one but then the ex-head of the UK advisory drugs council says that weed/X/Lsd are safer than alcohol and tobacco?). So who knows what to think really, it makes sense that people do their stuff and read the Sun for a bit of entertainment. It&#039;s the acting like its important and the being self righteous because you&#039;ve read an opinion in a newspaper or saw something on TV that pisses me off. If they want to buy into all that stuff that is their right but it gets to me when they try to force it on other people and act better than them because &quot;drugs fry your brain&quot; all the while they&#039;re sitting at home sipping a beer with no sense of hypocrisy.

They&#039;re not the same as any guy on the street exactly but in the sense that their opinions are just as based on misinformation and media myths that have been around for ages. There probably is an air of self importance to them due to the power that comes with the job but I don&#039;t see it as impossible that their minds could be changed. Of course there are some people that you can&#039;t argue with but I think most people would be reasonable if presented with the evidence (eventually). It&#039;s just their whole lives they&#039;ve been told that drugs are bad, you get in there early with a new system of education and its perfectly reasonable that people would come round to the freedom/&quot;if it doesn&#039;t harm anyone then why not&quot; principle. <br /><br />And even in the short term, it&#039;d take a bit more than publicity for the commons to do anything/or even think about doing anything to SR. At the very least someone dying, and probably a kid ODing - would be enough for there to be a serial continuous story about it over the course of a few weeks and to create a media campaign, as opposed to these quick-buck back-page sensationalist stories that people read for a bit of breakfast entertainment and that no-one in government seems to really care about (yet, again it could really happen if someone OD&#039;d), at least not enough to do anything other than make some offhand comment to a newspaper.

				I&#039;m not overly worried about this. I think if anything, its going to be an eye opener to people. Our community at SR is so great, every single transaction I&#039;ve had has been so smooth. On the streets the drugs are really cut up and the users don&#039;t know how to dose safely. Personally I think if you&#039;re smart enough to remain anonymous on SR, you&#039;re certainly smart enough to dose correctly and safely. If anything SR is reducing the harm.

				Haven&#039;t there been several news articles like this already? Nothing has come of it yet. I&#039;d be curious to know what LE&#039;s reaction would be to the journalist actually placing and receiving the drugs. You&#039;d think if it was so evil and dark that he&#039;d be less willing to actually place the order.<br /><br />But hey, at least some of SR&#039;s vendors get some money out if it? Hopefully no negative backlash on either of them.

				Governments DO need illegal drug trading to justify the existence of LE and budget spending and laws tightening, to keep the balance. All those articles are just for politicians` advertisements like &quot;we will bring&nbsp; the illegal drugs trading down, and we will need another zillion dollars/pounds/euro to fight it&quot;. <br /><br />BUT they will have to find a scapegoat just to show that the money spent by taxpayers are working.

A massive media article would most likely NOT mention the silkroad by name as to prevent more people from buying drugs... even though they do feature many SR pictures on there. I lol&#039;d when I saw Djabbars bricks of hash.

				People that post that sort of bullshit aren&#039;t trolls as such, just deluded in the face of a wall of technology that they cannot comprehend, understand or interpret.<br /><br />What does &#039;wrong&#039; mean in any given moment.&nbsp; Its a sand dune, its shape and size are constantly changing, blown by a wind that cannot be stopped or altered.<br /><br />Wrong today is less wrong tomorrow and in a few years, forgotten as even bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;History provides many examples.<br /><br />I think that publicity of SR isn&#039;t a bad thing, its existence in the end shows that the law makers are actually less clever than the people who make things for real.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Picture the average Sun reader trying to learn enough about IP addresses, SSL, Tor, TrueCrypt and PGP to get active on this site. Of the ones that do manage to scrape their way onto SR, do you think they will protect themselves as well as you do or will they buy Bitcoins with their credit card and log in to their personal GMail from the same Tor session they used SR? A lot of my peers need help to upload pictures to Facebook!<br /><br />If you&#039;re protecting yourself better than average Joe would when he stumbles into this place, Joe will be the low-hanging fruit that LE manage to bust. A wall of idiot users would actually protect the sensible users to an extent.<br /><br />However, I think you *should* be concerned about your MPs hearing rumours of &quot;a secret online lair where paedofiles trade heroin for machine guns&quot; and discussing it in parliament. I&#039;d really like to hear suggestions on how to combat this. <br /><br />For example, whenever a new SR-related article pops up, we could collectively leave comments saying SR is a prank/honeypot site set up by &quot;Anonymous&quot; (UK tabloids LOVE to talk about Anonymous) to collect junkies&#039; personal information and mess with them. Or to scam Bitcoins. If you have a blog, you could write a post about how you ordered from SR so you could write an article on it but you were scammed. And all your friends were scammed. Try to get SR dismissed as a joke by the general public.<br /><br />Everyone on here is supposed to be computer savvy. Why haven&#039;t we blackhat SEO&#039;d a blog post about how SR is a scam/prank to the first SERPs for Google searches of &quot;silk road&quot; and &quot;is silk road a scam&quot;?

Last Summer. It was reported on ABC News too. The UK Parliament and media have had more than enough time to react to the existence of Silk Road, and most notably in Parliament, there has been nigh-on no mention. It&#039;s hardly a non-political development, is it? It&#039;s hardly a non-news story either, don&#039;t you tell people you know and trust? Don&#039;t they mostly react with similar exclamations of disbelief and disquiet at this development? It wouldn&#039;t be difficult to provoke an even stronger reaction out of right-wing tabloid readers, and this in turn would sell papers. For whatever reason, right wing tabloids don&#039;t want to sell the story though (The Sun being the only apparent exception, and I think we&#039;re all aware of the fact that Cameron and Murdoch may not be best of friends at the moment)<br /><br />The media and the governments won&#039;t bring it up, at the very least until someone gives them a good reason to.

				- parliament / SOCA etc will have more reason and amo to deal with Silk Road if more are caught and especially buying weapons into uk, I<br />&nbsp; think if seen as not causing much harm and &quot;users&quot; behave themselves and act responsibly with their drug of choice its likely to be left to<br />&nbsp; operate -well from a uk perspective, as its probably not a service that could is seen to operate as if it were a central service from within uk...<br /><br />
