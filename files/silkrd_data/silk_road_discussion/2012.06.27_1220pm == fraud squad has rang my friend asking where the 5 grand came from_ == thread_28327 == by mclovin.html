The banking institution has no responsibility to investigate themselves and in fact are specifically forbidding from alerting a customer that their transaction is being investigated. I know this as I work in Finance in the UK!<br /><br />V.

				Of course they&#039;re going to ask him where it&#039;s from, especially if he doesn&#039;t get 5k transactions into his account on at least a monthly basis. My bank does this too. It&#039;s nothing unusual, they just want to cover their bases before they start letting him withdraw it. <br /><br />He could have hacked someones account, sent it to himself and then withdraw it and shut his account quickly, they don&#039;t want that to happen, because they would be out of pocket.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing to worry about, they don&#039;t actually care where the money came from or what it is being used for. As long as you don&#039;t phone your bank and moan someone stole 5k in the next few weeks then all will be cool by the pool. <br /><br />If it was a serious issue then it would be the police phoning, not his bank. It&#039;s a curtsey call is all. The police won&#039;t bother investigating for less than £10k anyway at the moment. Believe me I&#039;ve got away with a lot of silliness for less than 10k a time in the past.<br /><br />There&#039;s several different thresholds (levels) at which a UK bank will pass different types of fraud onto the police, privately investigate, refund or simply block. Knowing those thresholds can be particularly useful if you are someone who needs to move money around or purchase things under the table.

It would still work though but it&#039;s not ideal. Offshore companies are so easy to buy you can use a different one each time. They&#039;re like candy.
