				Hey Everyone! I&#039;m Norseman and I&#039;ve been writing reviews for many vendors over the course of the last months.&nbsp; I know one of the most inconvenient parts about using the road if getting your coins uploaded into your account; well I was lucky enough to find the perfect solution about a month and a half ago!&nbsp; Since then I&#039;ve used CryptoCurrent, which is a legitimate bitcoin broker who accepts cash deposits at Bank of America, bank wire, or cash overnight via prepaid FedEx / USPS (that they pay for, not the client), and they have a website for orders but if you need bulk order of coins you can send them an email at:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

This is a completely legal business, and if terms like those are not encrypted the business will be shut down.<br /><br />They even have Their PGP key on their website, but here it is for convenience:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />mQINBFDpNNcBEADXzIXDd+2WcOPNhBfxJl7wL+PB+96i/c0PL76d2pMmVSfg7B0V<br />lSo1P5gf545LFUSJ+hhdKRSsdMWcKzwQeN0swGS8MkWCIa6wyPyAmtWAtBKTOSgu<br />uYODDS1XbGAuA3kbgxh3NqS8e3dChcQHd9jtgX8bdnMT1sD1WUoPYSSz8MzmBbRx<br />UycjKVoi/xfFwhkze2MObMeVh9o7/ZDJQSHD6HSu/3siebCpPDLzhEv1V1qpFzL8<br />INpmeeXCj8q1V/GDC/HFd50RAR2aja64HELOiG2ur0h7rN+hhq+/0IbIuTFC5ybv<br />N999H45+QFRolRj+15CuavYpNgi70YWkkdtZjohHH0E8mkiWtq47SbaXleo9Q0ru<br />MC2qHrV+1xmU6n0OJldRo4koGQO0MzVzB93N+FnhkFJj+I7ldbsh+yYMm8OMJH+j<br />dvbzYnIucKbpW+9o6yf5JLlDspJToqS28phnV59zeYsPd9Glik9REez4cteAP1F6<br />7Fn7cO87uGKtCGaV+Aagjwy/cb5oZTPHrjJuVKS40OzLgRR9g4v3O0bWZDjZ8Npb<br />bPQypY4Qf7syVDG4leb8DPqMPesJuzkzZzXHOvLMlMgE0RZnaoHIx/UotpqVecRK<br />rQY9XjoD4I20yNxiz/rmJC+KjNze+cGfMv/vkUpOI7c9AAFET0LXcUkJKwARAQAB<br />tCZDcnlwdG9DdXJyZW50IDxpbmZvQGNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbnQuY29tPokCPwQTAQIA<br />KQUCUOk01wIbLwUJB4YfgAcLCQgHAwIBBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEB16<br />6LkpWNH0j9oP/0ishM73jc3cIGmt4L1IrJKP1wt4rD5ZYBPJxH9XyPDooOOVKsil<br />hLExoiLqyHMcmNEmtyh3rDfJWj4G6hdM0COm2MOExrDJLGhC+PwzTRjZXhavHDox<br />msdpIBdB/TNY5cNDk31UgyuLMK92q9Ti6zTtzEeybhdCwQvrnv1PC9cOTGmo5bG8<br />85wawmAjvJ9l7xE6P7KlhKwiQZUhePb8FTBTNbofb2IrxkXkxzYbSxCKBzonJzbf<br />oXia+7Jqh3C2qWR9UPiy+dB8VydpesRdJWCYVZfJGkAwzx5F5Y9mLOKb/bKDPEIJ<br />KqK+tIT3O+eY+XgXychaMCjAEbBspSzXqW1ZGg+FQeuKFJZMy3iSDc73pc7h6oAA<br />gDyjk0umvSstLbFUlzcTDfAW/5aOTSq4ajxot0ov3UfJ9NfqZu/CjKEohI91EFgX<br />lJtOt/qlAOsV477KgpLKShedke+DrBSNBI+fdRM7g5zb8f0IWuuv9jVxwG+MzDvH<br />UQhpdeLeyYJUppM6gaaL3OMPL40BDSjJETCimLlP8Sl2/R05IV2GED6/eyaME1P8<br />y+n04kOkQX7T2y1spvQ/KAof73P94+bFjHKkGOGneSTQGqKcEeVOFmyHDkfXzZnV<br />YAV3LlEuF6XJhzEC3mIWOtcDYWj6LZDQj0sORVzqCNnCKB3jDyg1PJ32uQINBFDp<br />NNcBEADGbuHCYSqcKNUlVRZZ8+RUz9AtEQIx+JHuc483XskShi2otDV9dxzK3AnS<br />CPJ5doX2cES5BdeZ/bFAZjOYKprqbg5T2JV97nzW3rPSWeeGHP8DTMh96bLZzDeC<br />gVvZxIDmNA5saITpw56HfQAyes6vS6HTdv1tMZlf0pSC09sPYG3za9MU4bkhy4em<br />cG0frGVoCipneDJueachmOV3rLgNLY5KSsnpcOPjOSBBtrTogXnjHmm+jVFcUBUj<br />5DOZFQS3/z00jekMN0Xyd+KgZDzT1KsTTYHGZBBwJi4kHp7KysbELY0ZKnwMe3Ex<br />oEIXs4W1CDSHxhxHXaZ9tIQF3B9XlLOhYh+qV0zySr8QdBhJGS4xqAJNXpk9Dzin<br />puVU0vfBljYKDWdWouIwraHizmNNoHB0bv4nuXZhrUIAqcEYYZw/c5H7BdOGe7/R<br />EYwVFPUmf3idcR2iyk4sDRIvGPPztmK1F97QdlkD38CbLf2MsAN1XMLyuhBgYscp<br />+T8VetSp62Ax/p5xAjeaFcmxX+pDyEIzRCJN7Tc1BqZ8IwLdJrUWO71pv9rwiTNH<br />l9BjqprS8RJNdxf6iRv5IP8SCRQ3Zp9rxFwO184qfw9KjHFbI3RNQfGdEIlhExvr<br />F3X0fIHO6ZaEzq2JwTv0TjZZKCqugXLt9TTsDVdIZVVvCgMDrwARAQABiQREBBgB<br />AgAPBQJQ6TTXAhsuBQkHhh+AAikJEB166LkpWNH0wV0gBBkBAgAGBQJQ6TTXAAoJ<br />EPTuZllZritOsTYP/2GL0exGBuvmrS9ZRJTt0bqa30pg8lKtwV42MDDWUJYDNLH5<br />pFwCvyvuATlKeICW+iU3JRtgvV0U6UcFnszO30kZB0il5peQw1qYCg1f+1niubuT<br />G7xvvtUK7tpcanqXuAFoXld8Iupg+ArVl4hauIxoDhldSWawghKpmsjKMboJOKC8<br />s78cj3Ootm5tghKM9iM6n7UCHCgUsNF0suLV0pA9oY+QyOzIVpfra6tl10BQJQiL<br />6PqYXG+9bjSsNh5s/1sUQmoQoPmWiLmXVg2j3jV7LWdEPZ0s5VFdSDVjS5Dn6yfH<br />YYBnZ/skzStw4kAB4wpzyONS9ikcZB6omOEi35Rz6iiQyc6MGvMGwlSPToK1Gboc<br />nx4o7MY+rYkPvE3m/HD9zOXXeqbhhJt6aUcquskkOpBz2dAYh9LUVOHS+WpcJTCt<br />s8KR3Ehy7//NpJbW4Rocl1e9fVzk+HPIv109fC4Tnm64pWqUKrt2TphERWfc5574<br />HQkHPDDPgMJ+kz1Q17aKvPFFf/dhR+XX+F14HvIn99Z0l/Ws6LUj3ObVRhYb4+mN<br />LYhV+jAicRfyfTdp0CjE11lx4OSfexBOHUUDkffW0C9eNfyiqSWQAcCRva/qad9X<br />k3L/lnhoaNlto+FRIEKYTM/Y7OK9AK8Tg7wGaJ4qE4rAp4xm0pF4FjjxN1NeopIP<br />/1KA0Gva9BWZSUnp3gND9a6GKpU+baJx6iKokBIDoS76cgUvHEM/WdGXZMlypcpQ<br />ehDry3oNZa/w3cAuZu6KGRmslnReqQE0u+kES+y56cPVzAnlsE2sOwvgmJbJE7LP<br />Z8zuvGHafW0CXJtW5lXnDGmrdsGK5kLh/oK5Y1l9Nf7CbEueMPQfzyLlvInECdS/<br />DGSxymnog+R4T6Zm2oW1IMk/eyerIydnSm/p/g/NdPKRZKHVMI8nVfaj0AXKoism<br />NpOmOeIKxICfnyWbdwvMS9KTjZk7NrJ34eCHdPpZ28Ieyo/dSa7Cax/Qsw1pPs5I<br />GmwVNd1k3bVlZsSNsiH03rBVdOtH49qV7QefHin+GUjrTLXt4FYuQ+LinHLtYXjC<br />DUtBGCTmyYI3Gqj19DSGorykSdUvhAglvgoCfQLOeGtXXEppiiEZVuk7dRDUhNBn<br />u+3sKboqwM7OHZLGuQa5dio7jjuhQds1iHkdY/FqNCcZ+uCtYPiqsGYXvDxDMcLE<br />sHVYAKkyPonGfe9anuZWzAXkLjGTylsf+5IOwaW5xSXOiBrzTcX/MmX75jS8wPAw<br />SeClEW9FlO2xvaRqYORStLjNRXytmgDPzaFB4nsYhN9mc3FRTUkDfKzo6P4Vy/+4<br />iv+q1yfjOH6iC4Z+sytgQGTG4KRhzLE5M5s2FHu9KNrb<br />=MP+P<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />The fee is only 5% of the total transferred and it can be sent directly to your SR account without ever providing any personal information to anybody.&nbsp; All that is necessary is to walk into a bank, or go into the drive thru, ask the teller for an &quot;Out of State Deposit Slip&quot; and fill it out with their information which will be provided to you if you send an email to the address above.<br /><br />CryptoCurrent ALWAYS provides the blockchain info immediately so that you can trtack your coins during the sometimes long wait as they are processed through the tumblers built into SR.&nbsp; This is a GREAT relief to many who hate waiting for coins and not knowing if/when they were actually sent.&nbsp; Here CryptoCurrent gives you a receipt of purchase EVERY TIME!!<br /><br />The one restriction is aminimum is $100 deposit.<br /><br />I personally love CryptoCurrent and have exchanged tens of thousands of dollars flawlessly every single time!&nbsp; Even after the fees, you still get a better deal than other Bitcoin sites like Bitinstant which is becoming more sketchy and also charges fees; also you do not have to go through the trouble of sending coins through additional tumblers to prevent their purchase being traced back to you!<br /><br /><br />Go ahead and Shoot CC and Email I guarantee your business here on the road will become much MUCH better!&nbsp;

				Yeah, I got a question for you: need a programmer?&nbsp; LOL...<br /><br />Also, if the business not being shut down is dependent on customers not mentioning drugs, it&#039;s as good as dead.&nbsp; If your business can&#039;t survive the inevitable, get out while you still have something left.<br />

				@SS,&nbsp; This isn&#039;t my business, I am just a loyal customer trying to help a vendor out who I think deserves the business of people who are smart about safetly when it comes to communication.&nbsp; <br /><br />In regards to &quot;not mentioning drugs&quot;; again that is only for unencrypted messages.&nbsp; Learing how to use PGP encryption is simple and there are many step by step guideds here on the forums if anybody needs assistance setting it up.&nbsp; As a general rule of thumb I would not ever mention SR or specifically asking for coins to buy drugs over an unencrypted email and advise others to do the same as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />&nbsp;- N

				Er, yeah, that&#039;s not good.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible they&#039;re using a self-signed certificate or something -- if going to the non-encrypted version of the site (take the &#039;s&#039; off the &quot;https://...&quot; I mean) doesn&#039;t cause a warning, it&#039;s something silly like that.&nbsp; If it&#039;s an actual virus warning or something or it still happens, definitely shouldn&#039;t be going there...<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how it can be on the Tor network only though.&nbsp; It&#039;s in the .com top level domain, it&#039;s not an onion site -- should be able to get there from anywhere.&nbsp; Well, whatever.<br />

				My appologies I suppose it doesn&#039;t need to be on thr Tor network, its just whenever I order my coins I send an email directly to the email adress provided to a tormail account.&nbsp; This way everything is anonymous and I find it to be the quickest and easiest way.&nbsp;

I keep seeing legal exchange businesses popping up. Most likely due to the greater acceptance by the general public of BTC and because the higher the exchange rate goes, the more lucrative it is to be a trader. I would really like to learn more about this business. Anyone willing to volunteer some more info would be greatly appreciated. Is there anyone willing to consult me on this business? Now please don&#039;t flame me about staying safe on SR, as this is a completely legal business, and I&#039;ve not done anything illegal...with this username and that can be traced back to me at least.&nbsp;

				Yea if this is TC then this is legit. I&#039;ve done a lot of business with them. Very professional crew of guys. I&#039;ve actually pmed people on SR forums to take down info on TC in the past lol I wanted to keep that shit under wraps. They&#039;ve done over a million dollars worth of BTC sales by now surely. They&#039;ve worked 6 figure deals with clients BUYING btc. They shut down new customers a while back in order to work on their new websites. Very trustworthy and legitimate guys. I worked with them heavily until they started limiting my cash deposits lol. Plus I found a better connection on my coins...<br /><br /><br />Tangible Cryptography is legit as fuck though.

CryptoCurrent is run by experienced and loyal vendors who have just launched their new website in order for people like us to have easier access to our bitcoin supply.&nbsp; Give them an encrypted email and see for yourself, and start small so you see how things work and I assure you that Cryptocurrent will not let any new clients that follow the rules down!

				Tangible Cryptography = FastCash4Bitcoin and BitcoinsDirect.&nbsp; CryptoCurrent is completely unrelated.&nbsp; Also, to those bitching because they don&#039;t want illegal things mentioned, I&#039;d encourage you to read the Terms of Service for other clearnet bitcoin vendors -- not a single one will accept an order if the buyer advertises that their order is for illegal purposes.&nbsp; There&#039;s no reason to mention drugs when you are buying bitcoins from these companies.<br /><br />This is 100% normal and to be expected from a legitimate business on the clearnet.&nbsp; Much like how any mention of anything illegal on bitcointalk, for instance, is immediately deleted.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the virus warnings, I looked using a regular non-tor browser and did not receive any virus warnings.&nbsp; It might just be an issue with the certificate set up, who knows.

				I have heard these guys are good. Glad they have officially opened for biz :-)<br /><br />@norseman17<br />Hi :-)<br />I have not read all the comments yet, but felt the need to quickly say I think you should change the OP. I&#039;m sure encrypting sensitive info is a good thing to tell everyone. I think they like everything encrypted anyway. The change I would suggest is to tell people &quot;not mention any illegal activity when communicating with them&quot; (encrypted or not). Maybe you are saying stuff they are OK with, IDK. Why would anyone need to mention anything illegal when trading btc/currency? <br /><br />I think they want to be a legit business that supports a wide range of customers.&nbsp; I think it is best for their customers that they not be knowingly involved in anything illegal. LE can encrypt detailed info about an ongoing illegal enterprise and ask to trade. I believe that if they do the deal, LE has them at it&#039;s mercy (and probably can get any records they failed to destroy). I could be overly paranoid, but they are out to get us.&nbsp; NWN
