				I can understand if some of you choose to FE. Some of you have an established relationship with certain vendors. Some of you want to make vendors&#039; reup game easier. Some reputable vendors require it...<br /><br />But what I really, really dislike: Why the fuck do you have to leave a feedback that says &quot;FE&quot; or &quot;FE WILL UPDATE UPON ARRIVAL&quot; or anything like that. <br />It pisses me off for several reasons:<br />A) I like to analyze recent feedbacks to see who&#039;s actually receiving from a vendor and how long it&#039;s taking. This gets interrupted by all your stupid FE&#039;s<br />B) Why not just leave the feedback once you ACTUALLY RECEIVE the fucking package? That way, when you do leave the feedback, it&#039;s on page 1. Those of you who &quot;update upon arrival&quot; have your feedback buried behind 15 pages of other E-finalizers that left a useless &quot;FE&quot; comment.<br />C) WHY BOTHER?! Knowing how many people are finalizing early isn&#039;t really beneficial to people. Maybe slightly. But IMO definitely not worth it.<br /><br />i.e. I&#039;m about a month and a half into a large order with ST. I check his recent reviews daily to see if anyone is receiving a package sent around the same time my supposed reship was. It&#039;s extremely annoying to see 3+ pages in the last 48 hours of people just leaving &quot;FE&quot; for a feedback. It would be a lot more beneficial to everyone ordering from ST if you just wait until your package arrives to leave a feedback. OR, if you&#039;re like me on day 40 something, maybe then you leave a feedback saying &quot;Still haven&#039;t received my huge order after 40 fucking days, waiting on reship&quot;<br /><br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m mad bro. &gt;:(<br /><br />It would be nice to see less people leaving a feedback immediately after finali

If vendor wouldn&#039;t be as awesome as him, I wouldn&#039;t bother to edit, or leave FB once it arrives. <br /><br />It&#039;s fair to assume that if it doesn&#039;t show people would go back and edit for sure, giving 1/5.

				Finalizing Early needs to be wiped out forever. There was a post by Flush, an Admin., who wrote there would probably be a change in the rules to outlaw it altogether in the not to distant future. I will never understand on an anonymous market why someone would take a huge risk with their money when they simply don&#039;t have to at all. I totally agree with Crooked&#039;s sentiments though.&nbsp; :)

You can finalize a transaction and when the feedback page comes up just navigate away from it without doing anything. This will leave that transaction open for feedback but finalized. When you receive the product you just go back to &quot;Orders&quot; on your account and the feedback box will still be there like it just happened. This way the vendor gets credit for the transaction immediately as well as access to the funds and there is no BS feedback like &quot;FE will update.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with the OP. This is frustrating and I wish more would realize how to properly handle FE. It&#039;s quite annoying to have feedback as a tool, but none of it is relevant. It&#039;s a way too common problem that I hope is addressed.

				Forgot to mention this one in the OP, but another thing that really pisses me off about EF&#039;s leaving a &quot;FE&quot; comment immediately is that you inflate the vendors rating for no reason! For example, if all these EFers hadn&#039;t left ST a 5 out of 5, his rating surely would not be in the 90s right now! <br /><br />My solution to all this would be SR disabling feedback for at least 3 or 4 days after the order is placed!

				Re- the blank box. We apologize to have posted an assumption as fact.<br />We stand corrected, and lesson learned.<br />Banning FE would not be the end of the world. <br />It is weird that it exists when everyone on the admin side of the road says don&#039;t do it! Then why have it? <br />What if even the best vendor in the world gets shut down or destroyed (disaster , fire,&nbsp; flood) all the FE&#039;s go down with him/her. <br />Feedback that is too delayed won&#039;t be worth shit, we know that if we get a raft of chems, if we don&#039;t diligently, weigh, record, log and note it all in detail, in a few days we won&#039;t remember when who sent how much of what! Especially if we&#039;re complexing new trips for the first time. :o&nbsp; Even reviewing our notes after we peaked today we found a weight error right at T:00:01 of our trip report.<br />Maybe SR could hold a significant percentage of a newbies BTC in &#039;honor&#039; escrow until they have a track record? It raises the bar to entry, but then again, the upwardly motivated always find a way to join an exclusive club. or it could just mean the scams get bigger and more complex...<br />

				I hope they don&#039;t get rid of the feedback system.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know myself and probably many others rely on it to judge a vendor for the first time.&nbsp; .&nbsp; Like you say people would use it properly it would be a very useful tool.<br /><br />It can be a useful tool to get an idea on quality and people&#039;s experiences with the product.&nbsp; Of course you could search the forums , but it&#039;s handy spot makes it functional if used right.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not even a vendor but I don&#039;t mind FE for trusted vendor as long as he has proof that my package was shipped. The prices are so high because vendors have to take into mind possible reships/refunds and untracked letters/packages just tends to get &quot;lost&quot; especially in 3rd world countries where there are so many thieves in postal system. I mean I was ordering stuff long before silkroad existed and it wasn&#039;t drugs and 1/4 - 1/5 unregistered package got &quot;lost&quot;. And what you can do ? No tracking - it doesn&#039;t exist. How many of you lost unregistered packages and did not get anything from customs? However I never got any package missing with tracking number and I sent tracked packages with heroin in condoms no fancy vac seal and everything went fine.

				Many vendors had a ten buy rule when I joined before we could have escrow!<br /><br />I agree new buyers opught to FE, this stops scammers who would simply set up accounts, buy something, deny it came and get reunds or resends.<br /><br />Generally speaking I don&#039;t need to FE as my stats prove I pay and that nothing I do not have any no shows.<br /><br />But some vendors are 100%, they do ask for FE but do not demand it.<br /><br />Going FE on large amounts is risky unless you got tracking.

				I know everyone says don&#039;t FE yet vendors require not only that you FE but that you also leave 5 feedback. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t use the escrow system and you must leave a 5 in feedback how can a new person get any kind of feel for who to take a risk with?<br /><br />The flip side of that is if a vendor ships quickly, discreetly and is as described then the vendor is entitled to a swift release of funds and a good detailed review. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Goat porn won&#039;t get you a btc - unless you&#039;re ready to go direct to web with your actions (let us know)<br /><br />Any ways most reputable vendor don&#039;t require F/E but you need to remember if you received your package as advertised. -&nbsp; finalize<br /><br />i&#039;ve had people take my gear by happy and not even log on again the transaction &amp;&nbsp; auto f/e&#039;s - that sucks <br /><br />well this hurts sellers that put moneys upfront - i hope that makes sense and i&#039;m not implying F/E rather if you get the shipment finalize<br /><br />then go seek your goat

				I hope that day comes when everything is kept in escrow... It would take tweaking the entire system though...<br /><br />what im thinking is EVERYTHING stays in escrow... but.... all sales must be sent express/FAST AND sent with tracking... once the vendor sees that it has been &quot;delivered&quot; they mark that in the new system... than the buyer has X amounts of days to finalize or make a resolution ..<br /><br />ect ect

				One of the reasons I have not made my first purchase is that many vendors will not sell to a new buyer unless they f.e. and I am simply not comfortable with that.&nbsp; :-\ banning FE would be good for SR

I could point you in the direction of quite a few vendors who will work with you and are reliable. PM me if you like.

				It&#039;d be nice if the SR webmasters would just add a &quot;leave feedback later&quot; button or something.&nbsp; Unfortunately most n00bs, whom this thread is started for, don&#039;t even know these forums exist and will never see this thread until they are no longer a n00b.

A change on the SR page is needed. This is only advice that all to often is only accessed after it&#039;s needed.
