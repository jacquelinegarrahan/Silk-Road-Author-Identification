				I know a lot of people were having issues with scammers over there, but finally admin decided to nail it down and have introduced an escrow system similar to that of SR.&nbsp; Just thought people should know because there is a huge hate-on (and rightly so up to now) for that site:<br /><br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php

				OK I admit that I have made a couple of critical comments about BM, however I think they are valid.&nbsp; The admin of the site was advocating keeping CP sales as his market is open to everything.&nbsp; Objecting to CP is one thing, but it also opens your site to attacks by vigilante groups.&nbsp; Black Market already had this happen once and the user/pass list was exposed.<br /><br />The other issue does concern escrow funds.&nbsp; Given the site has been volatile in the past, I would be concerned of the site being taken down and funds in escrow being stolen.&nbsp; Yes this could happen on SR, but SR has a stronger reputation and has been around longer.&nbsp; Its a case of buyer beware really.

				i agree with rake. That place just has had too many issues. there was the cp issue most people know, there was the refusing to put in escrow after he said he would i assume because the scamers complained, there was the linking poeple who logged on to site to fbi.com, so many fake reviews from before there was escrow. it was just a mess from the get go, it was essentially silk road for scammers. there was nothing there to hamper scammers in the least and now the admin wil have to live with that. i would much rather go to ovdb then blackmarket. he just put no thought into blackmarket and it should have been good but it was just rushed beyond belief after the gawker rush to try to to make the admin money. after hearing him say he linked people who loged in to fbi.com and he was going to try to disable thier tor but thought he would be nice and not do that i just facepalmed.

				I hadn&#039;t been there in a while, but I thought he&#039;d quit the CP.&nbsp; That was bringing down wrath on his head that we don&#039;t need.&nbsp; I actually figured he&#039;d just got off to a bad start, but the truth is, the more of these places, the less heat on here...there was a point, for a few days there, when a lot of us didn&#039;t know what was happening w/SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s in our best interest for there to be more sites, as then, it may get to a point where someone else gets in the news etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />But yeah, the burns in the beginning were a drag, and then when some of the hacker groups got wind he was allowing CP, I bailed: I want no part of that crap.&nbsp; But anyway, peace be on the site, maybe they&#039;ll survive, maybe not, but I agree OVDB is good 2nd choice...it&#039;s gonna take a month or so before a lot of us breath easy again, anyway...gotta see how all this plays out...

				I was most likely scammed there recently (before escrow) but it wasn&#039;t much BTC...<br /><br />As for CP, I believe it is no longer allowed.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping with time (and escrow) it will build into something worthwhile. Competition is good!!<br />&nbsp;:)

				Ah now I see!<br /><br />Yes, competition is good.&nbsp; A hundred copy-cats will lead to a larger and stronger community outside of the extortionist/legalist/moralist violent system, increase security innovations and selling methods, and all in all make the state as irrelevent as it should be (before their bankruptcy does the trick in and of itself, I might add).

				did BM fix their issue of all the people with good feedback from Silk Road having their names faked on BM?<br /><br />Silk Road has has some serious issues, especially in the beginning. Before the auto adjuster and Bitcoin went up and down so much, prices were just silly. Sites take time to develop.<br /><br />I got a couple of PMs from the BM site operator. Seemed like an upfront guy, if a little overwhelmed. GreenCo may or may not open up there. Silk Road seems to keep them pretty busy.

				If the CP is gone I&#039;ll advertise there again<br />If he will escrow something else besides bitcoin, like prepaid semi-anonymous vouchers, then I can sell larger amounts there.

				First, why do people even pay blackmarket any shred of respect. The site is sketchy as all hell and has been from the first day it opened. He redirected people to FBI.gov or more likely got hacked and redirected. Then he got hacked again and had passwords of accounts leaked. So at best he is insecure as shit, and at worst he is insecure as shit and redirected people to fbi on purpose. To think that he had no idea his site was flooded with scammers is giving him a lot of benefit of the doubt, and I am more inclined to think he is a scammer himself. I would never trust him to hold a substantial escrow because he could very well just jack the entire thing for round two. Second, how is he going to validate sellers he has no history at all in the source forum scene, at least Silk Road has some good history over the past few months and there were plenty of vendors here prior to the gawker rush. The site tumbling coins is neat but no better than Silk Road not to mention that mixing drug money with drug money is ineffective anyway. I2P is not the ideal network for vendors to work on considering it has like 5,000 total users in the entire world and it is trivial for a random attacker with a few nodes to map out large percentages of the network. When they detect the one I2P node within a hundred mile radius of where the vendor shipped the vendor is as good as fucked. Tor is not much better unless you use a bridge though. Plus I2P eepsites are so weak to intersection attacks that he better hope for 0 down time or be multihoming in an attempt for redundancy if not anonymity. <br /><br />My opinion is stay away from black market. SR or OVDB are the only two forums I see any reason to work on, black market either pretends or attempts to offer some of the benefits of both, but in the end they fall short of either.
