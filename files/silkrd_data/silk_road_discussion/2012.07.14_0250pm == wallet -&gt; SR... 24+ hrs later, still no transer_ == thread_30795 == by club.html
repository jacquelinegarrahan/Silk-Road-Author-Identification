				I transferred coins to 3 instawallets, let them sit there for a few hours, and then transferred their contents to my SR account&#039;s BTC address, as I&#039;ve done dozens of times before. I&#039;m extra paranoid and double check the address even though Im copying/pasting it.<br /><br />But it&#039;s been well over a full day now and my coins still havent hit my SR account. I&#039;ve never seen it take this long. Most things you read always say &quot;be patient, it could take hours&quot; and sometimes it has. But never days. Is there any known issues going regarding this or anything?

				There indeed seems to be an issue. I&#039;ve been waiting for my transfer almost 3 days now.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30332.0

If anything, you actually have double the chance of getting ripped off by 3rd parties.

				I have never used a instawallet they just seem too sketchy on their face. I also have read many horror stories about the free wallets.<br />U guys do what u want - its ur bitcoins - I don&#039;t care.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying never lost bitcoins and never used free wallet.<br />I can only say that from what I have read on here and on bitcointalk etc etc the free wallets don&#039;t seem to be to free after all.

				The block chain shows my SR btc address has the proper balance it should and that all 3 transactions completed. SR itself is the only part of the equation not showing my balance properly. instawallet not to blame here

				@billybud<br /><br />Hi there. Normally it takes a few hours, in my experiences. This is the first time it&#039;s ever taken more than a day for me. But I think it&#039;s due to a problem, not the normal circumstances.<br />You can read here<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30332.0<br />several other people have been experiencing a delay. Many got their coins finally after about 3 days. I&#039;d email SR support if yours takes longer than that.

				@club:<br />Have you still not received your coins? I was in the same boat. I think mine took 3-4 days (I don&#039;t remember if I got them yesterday or the day before). I&#039;m sure yours will come soon if they haven&#039;t already. SR support worked hard/is working hard to get everyone&#039;s coins back.<br />Best of luck to all still in limbo!!<br /><br />P.S. --Remember to get a new SR bitcoin address after EACH deposit!

				As a Canadian, I got so confused as to how to get cash/BTC into my SR account. First I tried to do it with the imfamous (for Canadians) &quot;Synthetik&quot; who ripped me off and many other Canadians by the sounds of it.<br /><br />I&#039;m now using BTCmaster. He&#039;s done it for me three times and the longest it&#039;s taken is 1.5hours. I&#039;m sticking with him/her.
