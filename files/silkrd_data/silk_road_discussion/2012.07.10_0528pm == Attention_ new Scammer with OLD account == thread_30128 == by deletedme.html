				There&#039;s a new scammer on SR, deletedme (the same name I have here).<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b38b23cc96<br /><br />He only offers bulk&nbsp; and requests FE on all &quot;products.&quot;<br /><br />What&#039;s unusual about him is that he has an old (&gt;1 year) vendor account.<br /><br />This is because he bought this account from me on BMR.<br />I did not intend this account to be used for scam, so I&#039;m warning you guys here.<br />In addition, I reported it to the mods, having prepared a very simple and efficient <br />proof that the account was sold: I sent a message from the account to another one before selling it,<br />stating that it was&nbsp; about to be sold. This way admins on SR can check the message and see that he&#039;s a scammer.<br /><br />So I expect it to be banned pretty soon, but just in case SR admins are overloaded, I warn you guys here.<br /><br />take care.<br /><br />gonna crosspost in &quot;rumor mill&quot;

				i knew something was fishy with him. I had placed an order with him 2 days ago and it was marked in transit the next morning im glad i was not able to finalize this order as i would have been scammed. I have already msged the sr support hoping to get him kicked out as quickly as possible.<br /><br />mclovin478910

				yeah, he says on his profile he has been selling for over a year, it should be against the rules to sell a vendors account, not saying anything bad against you mate, but if this happened regularly, it would cause all sorts of problems, fair play to u for warning us though

				i dont think &#039;deletedme&#039; is doing anything wrong, he sold the account under the pre-tense it would be used legitimately, now the person is obviously using it for scam

				I would rather have a vendor sell his account instead of pulling a big scam on his way out the door. <br /><br />Silk Road needs to be able to reset the account after some one sells it though.

				I see two feedback scores for him.&nbsp; Both 1/5 and saying &quot;scam&quot;.&nbsp; Does this mean that he scammed two people?&nbsp; I assume so.&nbsp; His listing are still up.

				At least the original owner of the account is taking the only responsible action he can after selling the account and seeing it wasnt put to good use, yes?&nbsp;

				It is what it is. Just go with it, cuz the honest people in this community are smart enough to figure it out. People who deserve to be outed, will be. Word will spread<br />It still sucks though.
