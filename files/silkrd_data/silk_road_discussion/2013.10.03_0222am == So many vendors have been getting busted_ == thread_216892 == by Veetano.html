				I am the only one who finds it really strange that this isn&#039;t news in any big media website?<br />any major investigation over a millionaire drug deal is front page.<br />I dont know about you, but I&#039;m sticking around until I know all of what went down. (or all there is to be known)

				It was all over the mainstream TV stations earlier today. Funny how you never really heard a peep about SR on the tele until this happened. I guess reporting on a website that has successfully been trafficking narcotics for over 2 years would have been too big of an embarrassment for them, but now they can spin it to make it look like they are winning.
