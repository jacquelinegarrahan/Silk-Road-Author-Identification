				FIRST CONTEST TO START ON JUNE 1ST, 2013! ;D<br /><br />Welcome to “The Silk Road Vault: An Archive of Drug Experiences and Monthly Writing Contests!” thread! The purpose of this thread is to spark the inner creativity within the Silk Road community and promote positivity and beauty in writing by sharing detailed accounts of our experiences on drugs purchased here on the Road. The inspiration of this project is the absolutely wonderful resource of the erowid experience vault. erowid has offered myself as well as tens of thousands of others with beautiful insights on drugs and the experiences associated with them, and I want to carry this paradigm over to the Silk Road. Once we start accumulating reports, the ultimate goal is to be able to establish a full blown archive of trip reports organized by substance, the vendor whose product allowed such an experience, and the type of experience (positive/negative/etc.). Months from now I am hoping to be able to provide a much more thorough and detailed resource of experiences granted by substances purchased from the Silk Road in the form of a Wiki. I plan for this to be a great resource for buyers and vendors alike (think of it as an extended review thread), but more on that in due time. :)<br /><br />To kickstart this and get the creative energies and juices flowing, I will be running monthly contests where users are able to submit their experiences and win a prize based on a community poll and the end of each month. Each contest will begin at the start of each month and last until the end of the month. All submissions must be in by the final day of each month. At the beginning of the new month, I will have an updated thread that links all the submitted reports coupled with a poll that is open for one week where everyone has the chance vote and comment on which they feel is the most beautifully written experience. At the end of the polling week, I will close the poll and a winner will be chosen and a prize delivered! <br /><br />On that note, while I greatly encourage individuals post their experiences on any and all drugs, the majority of prizes will initially be psychedelic in nature (LSD, MDMA, 2C-B, etc.). However, as we gain a larger following, it is my hopes that drugs of all types will be offered and contributed to the prize pool. It is also my hope to be able to run best of the best contests that include goodie bags of multiple substances.<br /><br />To vendors and members alike: if you would like to contribute to the prize pool, please contact me here on the message boards or via Silk Road (same name, AnimusVox - donations can be sent to this Silk Road name as well if you would like!). This is a COMMUNITY project, and without you, this won’t be possible. Let’s turn this into something absolutely amazing and an integral part of the Silk Road experience! Also, suggestions are ALWAYS welcome! This will forever be a perpetually evolving contest and archive, so if anyone of you would like to recommend a change, feel free to make it known! :)<br /><br />GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSIONS<br /><br />1) First and foremost, these must be YOUR experiences, preferably ones experienced within the past one or two months. If I, or any other member, finds that you plagiarized any bit of your report, you will be immediately disqualified and added to a list which consequently bars you from participating in any future contests. This also includes previous trip reports that you’ve posted here on the message boards! The point of this competition is to see a new and creative side of the Silk Road flourish. I WILL be checking all reports to see if there is any foul play. Trust me, Google is a powerful tool and I have zero tolerance for plagiarism. <br /><br />2) Be creative! Be articulate! Be expressive! Be fun! The best reports are those that we are able to live vicariously through your words and fully immerse ourselves within your experience. Touch us with the sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, conversations, feelings, and everything else associated with the experience. There is absolutely no limit to what you can include, because this is YOUR experience. Make it a beautiful one!<br /><br />3) There will be TWO threads for each month of submissions, one for the actual trip reports and then another for the voting and commentary. When submitting your trip reports, please only submit the trip report in the SUBMISSIONS thread. Commentary on reports is greatly encouraged, but in order to avoid clutter, I must advise that all discussion take place in the POLLING thread.<br /><br />4) Within your trip report submission, please include the following items:<br />* Report Title:<br />* Date Experienced:<br />* Substance(s) Used &amp; Dosage(s):<br />* Vendor Purchased From:<br /><br />5) Last but not least, HAVE FUN, STAY ACTIVE, AND CONTRIBUTE! Involve the anonymous online world with your altered states of consciousness. :)<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />June, 2013 Contest<br />- Winner: TBD! 8)<br />- Prize: 10g of ukshrooms mushrooms<br />- Deadline: July 14th<br />- Submission Thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166774.0<br />- Poll Thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166775.0<br /><br />* REPORTS<br />...<br />Author:<br />Experience Link:<br />...

If you read the post it its entirety you would see I&#039;m not paying anyone, but instead offering an incentive for people to share their experiences in the form of a monthly writing contest. I&#039;ll reiterate the point of this entire initiative is to &quot;spark the inner creativity within the Silk Road community and promote positivity and beauty in writing.&quot; I, along with many others, thoroughly enjoy reading the drug experiences of others. My goal is to create a comprehensive thread filled to the brim with good vibes, positivity, great reads, and one day ultimately create our very own Silk Road experience vault that is comparable to erowid&#039;s and covers myriads of substances. If you rather not participate in this project and dislike reading trip reports, then it is as easy as avoiding the threads! :)<br /><br />Everyone else, thanks so much for the support and kind words! I&#039;ll keep you guys updated with the finer details as I iron everything out much more thoroughly. Again, if you guys have any recommendations, please feel free to let me know! I want this to be a COMMUNITY project, so the more the merrier. Much love to you all!

				Good point! How about something along the lines of &quot;The Silk Road Experience Vault &amp; Monthly Writing Contest&quot;? I think &#039;trip report contest thread&#039; is a tad basic. I&#039;d like a little pizzazz!<br /><br />As for types of experiences, I think we should accept any and all types of reports. The goal here is to see who can best articulate their experience and immerse us, the audience, to the point where we can almost live vicariously through them. I&#039;ve read bold accounts of opiate binges to beautiful reports of arbitrary chemicals such as 2C-T-7, to even surprisingly detailed accounst on the first time someone got high on marijuana. With that said, the majority of prizes will be of a psychedelic nature, most particularly LSD and MDMA. Contributions of other drugs are most welcome, but for any prize that come out of my pocket will be some sort of psychedelic. :)<br /><br />There is no restriction of creativity. These experiences can be written however each individual cares to write, and furthermore, the more unique, the better (how about some poetry?! Or a brief movie script with discussion?!)! You stated that you&#039;re not one to write good trip reports, GSE, but I digress! I remember reading a few of your personal accounts and I absolutely loved how you presented your writings. There is beauty and creativity within each and every one of us and I want to see that shine throughout the Silk Road community!<br /><br />In the end, this is a COMMUNITY project. I will not be selecting who wins these monthly contests, YOU guys will. My part is to organize all of this to the best of my ability. :)<br /><br />Keep the discussion flowing guys! I&#039;m throwing together the document as we speak and love what I&#039;m seeing!

				Very good.<br /><br />I have just an experience with DMT and Enochian Aethyrs that I wanted to share so that it could help some people out on understanding how to work with these substances in way that are not usually understood. <br /><br />I think this is the perfect tool to do so.<br /><br />Just tell me where I will have to send the report because it is the first time I do the thing.

				Subbed, definitely. <br /><br />SR should have a subsection just for this. Like an Erowid vault. And sub divide the SR Vault into drug class to make it easier to find reviews. <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe no one though of this until now. Good looking out OP. Great ass idea.

				Do these reports HAVE to be on Silk Road-procured products? I have one in particular in mind that I am especially proud of, but it occurred before I learned about this place.

				I have already writen an account of a friend who had suffered domesic abuse and had become almost housebound. We both took some MDMA and the experience helped my friend on the road to recovery. Whilst high, we made a list of things she had to do. We then went to the pub and we both danced as there was a disco on. We even got up for Kareoke! <br /><br />I read a lot about counselling and have worked in tha field. I would love to be a therapist licensed to be able to prescribe MDMA and for those being treated to be able to spend a few hours just talking. MDMA can do what normal counselling might take years or never be able to &#039;work&#039;. And you can enjoy MDMA just sitting in, talking to a close friend. I have even used it camping out sitting around a campfire. <br /><br />Its sad to see MDMA being seen as a drug for partying, it can be, but I think its use in counselling and therapy is amazing and its sad in the UK to see quite a few people die to to taking fake E pills. <br /><br />I know American soldiers suffering from PTSD were given MDMA, legally, and were counselled under the influence. <br /><br />I would love to join this contest but were do I submit my piece?<br /><br />I am currenly studying so can edit my piece to make it more up to date and get more practice in typing.<br />

				Hey guys, I have a couple of updates for you all. First off, the prize for the first contest has changed to a very generous 10g of mushrooms provided by the vendor ukshrooms (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3b621fea1a). <br /><br />Secondly, due to the unfortunate lack of many entries thus far, I am extending this round of the contest another 2 weeks (deadline: July 14th). I greatly apologize to those individuals that have already submitted their reports and followed appropriate suit, but the goal of this is to round up a lot of reports and then vote. So please, everyone, let people know! Post in any threads that you participate in any catch the eyes of everyone. We need YOU to snowball this into something great.<br /><br />Much love!
