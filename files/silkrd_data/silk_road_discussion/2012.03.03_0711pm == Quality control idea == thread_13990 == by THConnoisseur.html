				I have a couple questions. First off i want to say I am pretty disappointed with the silk road. I have yet to find truly connoisseur quality, medical cannabis products. Sadly this has come at a high cost, security wise and financially. So what can we do to protect buyers? Might I suggest the unofficial categorization of cannabis products? I exclude this idea to the largest categorization on silk road that IMO needs further categories. <br /><br />&nbsp; Also, is the rating scale for services product? I think a 1-5 scale is a bit basic, maybe there could be categories like 1-5 service, 1-5 product, 1-5 communication. Just seems to be there can be a level of quality control that runs more like feedback rather than the description of the item which i created by those who sell it. Categories such as Such as Regular, Middies/beaster, Dank/medicinal, categorizing it based on linked &#039;product&#039; feedback from customers. That would see much more accurate way to price and list items. I find a lot of people leave great feedback for service but don&#039;t really leave honest reviews for the product and this is misleading, at least for me and is very frustrating. Is this not an honest feedback system or do we just give 5 stars because the product has arrived? How will quality ever get better?<br /><br />This might be a silly business suggestion as the SR would lose money if people had to sell/compete with lower quality products pricing based on a categorization but surely there must be a solution where the buyers can have something more than a description and overall 5 point rating. I would like to suggest how this might help the SR as well, as I am about to give up finding what I need and would gladly pay the price for true medicine. It could be I jus haven&#039;t found it yet but the illusion of pricing/descriptions/broad feedback makes an accurate judgement almost impossible.

				I like the idea, but I feel like service and communication are best lumped in as one.&nbsp; I would however love to see a separate 1-5 rating for product.&nbsp; What if it didn&#039;t effect a seller&#039;s rating and would just be a tool to help buyers (which in turn would boost particular vender sales).&nbsp; <br /><br />Only problem I see with this is people take and rate drugs completely differently, which is the point i guess, but people don&#039;t always take an account for tolerance which could slander the rating of a good product.&nbsp; Also, the vagueness of SR&#039;s current feedback system is like an extra security measure.&nbsp; I like the idea though hopefully more will chime in their opinions.
