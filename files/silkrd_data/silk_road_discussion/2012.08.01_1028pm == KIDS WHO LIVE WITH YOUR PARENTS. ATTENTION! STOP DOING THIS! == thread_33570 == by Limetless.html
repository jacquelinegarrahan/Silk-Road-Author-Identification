				Stop asking for silly shit that you think will stop your parents or the post office from clocking you are buying drugs. My packaging is good enough and I don&#039;t need your help.<br /><br />Stop mentioning your parents and that you live with them. It makes me cancel your orders.<br /><br />Stop talking in an immature way while you make orders. If you are mature enough to buy drugs on SR you are mature enough to speak to vendors on an adult level. <br /><br />Stop treating this like you are buying from your &quot;Best Bud&quot; in the changing room. That is not what is taking place. <br /><br />Stop using the above to think you can ask for favours. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t do the above do not buy from me and you probably shouldn&#039;t buy from here full stop. If you are going to continue buying from SR then at least do me a favour and don&#039;t buy from me, I do not want to hear your bullshit. <br /><br />That is all.

				I don&#039;t especially care about that, I was doing Bing and Mandy when I was 14 lol. My issue is that I don&#039;t want to deal with kids-shit while I sell on SR. If you are here and under 18 and buying drugs then there is nothing that we are going to say that will stop you doing this, having said that, if that applies to you and you want to buy from me I expect you to deal with me in a mature manner and not need to be spoon fed or have your nappies changed. <br /><br />By that I mean - <br /><br />Asking to put bottle caps in your package because that magically camouflages it....it doesn&#039;t, in fact it red flags it because of the shape.<br /><br />Asking for stuff to be sent in CDs.<br /><br />Asking for stuff to be sent in books and magazines. <br /><br />Read my T+Cs, I don&#039;t do this for anyone. If you have read them and you think you can be a cheeky fuck and answer anyway you will still get a no. If you then keep asking I&#039;ll most likely call you a cunt and cancel your order.<br /><br />That is all.

				Yea, seems to be a lot of kids around here lately. <br /><br />You know I was always against the you have to be a member for X amount of time to purchase from me that some vendors use but I&#039;m all for it now. <br />6 month minimum would eliminate a lot of bs that would be pre gawker ad. Although, I&#039;m sure you could do 3 month and be much better off as well.<br />

				I suppose I fall under the category &quot;kid who lives with his parents&quot; but I would never order to my home address where a parent could discover a suspicious package, that&#039;s just asking for trouble. What would you do as a parent if a letter was mailed to your child containing powder that for all you know is anthrax? You would call the feds, and I wouldn&#039;t blame them.

				It is only a matter of time before a parent sees a suspicious international package and opens it themselves. In-fact, I suspect this has already happened. But I do not think parents would call the feds for most items, unless it looked a lot like anthrax.

				Good idea. I think there is a blurry line between playing god and acting morally. <br /><br />What is it that separates a moral drug dealer from an immoral drug dealer? <br />It is the dealer who knows that dealing certain drugs entails certain responsibilities. <br /><br />A dealer is responsible when s/he knows not to deal LSD to someone who is extremely upset or unstable. Or even someone who does not have a good set and setting to do it in.<br />It is not always about age, but it is about not providing substances to those who have a risk of harming themselves or others (or getting caught).<br /><br />Much respect Limitless. Drugs do not need to be regulated for them to be safe if the dealer can read people.<br /><br />

It&#039;s not my concern. What I am doing is just sidestepping headaches, as a vendor I can exorcise my right to not sell to certain people. In this case it&#039;s people who are annoying or likely to have their packages taken away by their parents and then say &quot;Oh yeah....my Mom took my Meph so is there any way you could resend it?&quot; and then when I flip out and call tell them to fuck off give me a 1, ruin my number and write some bullshit about how life isn&#039;t fair and how they are still having wet dreams or waiting for their period to start. <br /><br />None of this makes me have a stress free life so I&#039;m just taking the active decision to avoid this shit like it&#039;s the Clap.

Actually thinking back on it, it does make me feel better selling to people that aren&#039;t living with their parents. I fuckin hate it when people tell me shit like that because it just gives me the jitters about the whole thing, most of the time I cancel the order because it&#039;s just a fucking ballache I can do without. I don&#039;t like the idea of selling to kids but at the same time, understand it will happen. I just wish the little bastards wouldn&#039;t act/tell me when they buy from me.

				This thread made me add number 9 to the list on my SR page - <br /><br />THINGS I WILL NOT EVER DO SO PLEASE DON&#039;T ASK - <br />1. Label what is in a package. <br />2. Label the amount of a product in a package.<br />3. Label the package so you can identify it&#039;s coming from me. <br />4. I wont do favours like add in samples even if you ask me in a cutesy way. <br />5. I wont give special treatment to people. <br />6. I wont split your order down into doses unless given very good reason and am compensated for my time to do this. <br />7. I wont allow you to knock off silly amounts of BTC off my prices just because you are short 1-2BTC. <br />8. I don&#039;t give out free samples unless it&#039;s via the forums and I specifically offer them. If you ask I will say no, if you persist to ask I will ask you what makes you so special and then I will provide you with the answer that you aren&#039;t special.<br />9. I wont package your order in some stupid and unnecessary way because you live with someone else like your roommates, parents, spouse, pet Gypsy, your fag-hag, your monkey that&#039;s addicted to crack or your lesbian truck driver named Dave. It is too much to ask, it does take up my precious time and my answer will be either &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Fuck off&quot; or I just wont answer you. <br /><br />Also 300 Karma. OOOSH!

				If markets like SR are to be regulated in any semi-legal/decriminalized government approved fashion in the distant future, it is imperative that some mechanism, much like Capcha for distinguishing between person/machine, is developed as a age restriction.<br /><br />My own view is, if we&#039;re setting somewhat arbitrary limits, that it is 15+ for MDMA and weed, 18+ for opiates. The problem then becomes the same one that buggers our governments, which is that you&#039;re making an allure for hard drugs by designating them as &quot;18+&quot;, suddenly h is cool and MDMA is drool. Not exactly the intention. But its results that count, not intentions. The government also sometimes uses price controls with alcohol in the UK for example such that usually only adults can purchase items. This is also severely retarded, you penalize everybody for the sake of a minority. I think it&#039;s more effective if enforced properly, but still completely retarded from a moral point of view.<br /><br />However, there is a definitive difference between a human and a computer, not so much between an older human and a younger one. Therein lies the crux of the problem practically.<br /><br />I also do not believe it&#039;s all about &#039;age&#039;. Some people can be in their 30s or 40s or older, and still act immature. This has been frequently noted...<br /><br />==&gt;&gt; What we really want, is a way then, to distinguish responsible SR users from non-responsible ones in a rigorous manner.<br /><br />We can stipulate a &quot;limit&quot; system, but what will naturally occur is that it will be a failure because it doesn&#039;t address the problem. Essentially, when you get right down to it, everybody wants a distinction between &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;moron&quot;, because if preventing somebody using a drug in the wrong way or taking too much of it is the goal here, then the Mature/Moron criteria is clearly the one you want to be using. It is simply a better approximation to reality than using age restrictions, which are altogether too crude.<br /><br />We don&#039;t need to emulate the government, because they kind of cocked it up already. We can do it better than they can.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I have a solution, which is that you give me money. :D<br /><br />Only joking slightly, but I think this would be highly effective. Let me explain.<br /><br />When a vendor discovers some half illiterate punk (punk &lt;3) trying to nab some product, he becomes suspicious about the maturity of the said punk, as we can see from Lim&#039;s consternation.<br /><br />What happens, is that you say to this punk. &quot;You can buy from me&quot;. &quot;No problem. I can&#039;t prevent you, this is an anonymous network, you could always register with a new alt.&quot;<br /><br />However!<br /><br />&quot;First you must acquire this package from pine&quot;. says the wise and noble vendor. &quot;What package&quot; says the punk?<br /><br />&quot;Well it is simple, I sell MDMA, so you must acquire an MDMA support package from pine (and her competition) for *your first buy*&quot; says the vendor.<br /><br />This MDMA support package is a standard package signed off on by DPR. It contains two simple things.<br /><br />1. A vial of MDMA testing reagent to ensure it is actually MDMA you&#039;re ingesting.<br />2. A informative letter explaining the correct dosage for males/female per kg in a simple and easily understood manner. Also included would be the half-life and directions on &quot;best practices&quot;.<br />3. An identity number that Pine reports back to the <br /><br />Meanwhile, while they&#039;re waiting for product, they will be excited about their first SR buy, and will almost certainly read the letter and example the instructions for the vial as a result. They have nothing to lose, and neither do we, apart from a small quantity of money.<br /><br />--<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />It is entirely voluntary. No vendor is forced to do this. You simply join &quot;Pine&#039;s Responsible Drug Consumption League&quot; and take an oath where you (with complete discretion) decide whether or not to send a package outright, or whether to demand that the consumer acquire a &quot;care package&quot; from pine firstly. Perhaps on a first buy for opiates this ought to be mandatory.<br /><br />THAT, I think, is what we want the newspapers to report on us. We find the irresponsible newbs (handily capturing both the morons in the adult market as well as a majority of immature kids).<br /><br />Alternatively, the payment stategy would be that the care packages are FREE, but that DPR buys them on these newb&#039;s behalf from myself.<br /><br />I think this is a good idea. Not only because I make money, but also from an ethical/moral/commercial point of view.<br /><br />There is only one serious problem I can think of really. That is that I would be receiving the addresses of many SR newbs, so you would have to trust me doubly in comparison to a normal vendor. But... with competition that would arise naturally, a selection of trusted or random people could be preselected by DPR and that problem is solved.<br /><br />&lt;insert your thoughts into my thought experiment here&gt;<br /><br />

				Dunno if that would work Pinester, I like the idea in principle though although like I said before I don&#039;t really care about under 18s doing drugs per se, it&#039;s more the idiot kids that piss me off in the process of acquiring said drugs, <br /><br />By the way I didn&#039;t notice you were in triple-figure Karma Pine.

This service is mostly for those people who are newbs, and the vendor is unsure of their age. I think most vendors can instinctively tell if you&#039;re a kid, there are certain cues you pick up on.<br /><br />It is also a service for anybody who simply wants drug testing reagent because they want to be sure of what they are getting in general. There could be an add-on subscription service where you can buy MDMA / no care package, or MDMA with care package from each vendor. Not sure how that it implemented yet, but I&#039;m sure it could be done.

If any customers give me a bad vibe I will generally not serve them. <br /><br />With my money laundering work it&#039;s completely different though and I have always been extremely selective about who I take on and who I don&#039;t. When people come to me I vet them heavily and it&#039;s more like a selection process rather than merely ticking the boxes. Even if they are legit vendors I still sometimes say no because I only want to work with people that will actually make use and benefit from my system otherwise they are paying for something that&#039;s pointless to them. As well being picky makes sure LE aren&#039;t learning clever tricks they don&#039;t need to know.

				Honestly it&#039;s pretty simple:<br /><br />If you&#039;re a kid who lives with his parents and they _do_ open up your mail, don&#039;t fucking order.<br /><br />Also, who the fuck wanted bottle caps in their order, so their mommy and daddy wouldn&#039;t think its drugs but bottle caps for his collection? Please, give your parents a little more credit then that, I know they aren&#039;t THAT stupid.

				As I fall under Lim&#039;s targeted demographic, just thought I&#039;d acknowledge that obviously there&#039;s more paranoia under our circumstances. However all the vendors I&#039;ve dealt with package ultra stealthily. There really shouldn&#039;t be suspicion unless you have hardass parents or 4 packages coming in at a time. Fellow under 18-ers, just do a shitload of research and have a little balls

				After reading the last few pages, I can see why some vendors are losing their patience&nbsp; dealing with immature buyers. The vendors have had a lot of patience with this problem and I don&#039;t blame them one bit. And I use the word immature instead of juvenile for a reason - it fits better. Those of us that are mature and have learned how to use our drugs of choice responsibly see the Silk Road as a beautiful and wonderful place, and want it to continue to be.

It&#039;s more than just &quot;using drugs responsibly&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s about... taking the time to learn PGP to protect YOURSELF to protect the VENDOR.<br />Instead of &quot;you&quot; not taking the proper precautions to make sure your parcel gets to you then bitching and complaining at the vendor because it&#039;s &quot;their fault&quot; when clearly it is &quot;your&quot; fault.. the &quot;buyer&quot;.<br /><br />Any who. Point is... children are going to Q.Q and complain... simply because they are children. That&#039;s how they get what they want IRL.. why not try it on here?<br />So.. fuck scamming.. fuck your parents for opening your parcel... fuck your friends for not being trustworthy enough to not &quot;skimp&quot; it.. or replace it with some &quot;bunk&quot;.. fuck you for being a complete DICK and ruining the way vendors think/feel.<br /><br />That&#039;s the THING. This place used to be SO BEAUTIFUL.. because people cared about people.. EVERYONE WAS ONE! (How life was intended to be.)<br /><br />Then all of these raging peons came in here trying to act like ignorant ass fucks.. acting like everyone and everything is theirs.<br />YOU&#039;VE GOT ANOTHER THING COMING.<br /><br />You are all going to eventually be blacklisted.. because A. your grammar is terrible. B. you&#039;re a child. C. your grammar is terrible. D. your parents are pricks who care about you. D. YOU ARE A CHILD.<br /><br />Sorry............<br />Thumbs.
