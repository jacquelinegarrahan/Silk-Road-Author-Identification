				Meh dont be scared of LSD, just dont have too much.<br /><br />Are you having it alone or with some friends?<br /><br />Have a nice environment set up, or plan to go outdoors somewhere where your free to run around and just trip out and be amazed by nature. :P<br /><br />Have fun. ;)

				Edibles funny enough. Most people seem to start with weed and progress to other stuff but I&#039;m way at the other end. I&#039;ve only smoked weed 10 or 20 times and I&#039;m gonna try edibles for the first time this weekend.

				Well personally I just got home from work and got a nice package from Arnold with 5 grams in it. Already weighed and ready to go (5.124 grams) Thanks for the tip! Anyways I haven&#039;t touched a benzo in 2 weeks so after taking 3mgs 10 minutes ago I can already feel my body numbing up. 30 minutes from now it will be hard to talk and in an hour I won&#039;t be able to talk except for slurring and I&#039;ll be TRYING to watch TV. 2 hours from now I&#039;ll be fast asleep and do it all over again all weekend. AHHH. I Love Xanax Powder!<br /><br />Come Monday I&#039;ll sell 4.5 grams and make a good $1500. Lol. Isn&#039;t selling on the street wonderful!<br /><br />:)

				Got some methadone going on up my way after an extended absence from opiate use of any kind and it reminds me how amazing this body buzz and euphoria are, but also how much they are to be respected and not used with any frequency by someone like myself that&#039;s inclined to get addicted easily!<br /><br />Some Xanax powder sounds amazing right now too Jemeson you lucky bastard lol. I would get myself into some crazy blacked out trouble with only a fraction of that on hand even if I intended to sell it all! Do be careful and have fun everyone.

				I would give my right nut for 40mg of 2C-B and 250ug of LSD for this weekend. As it stands I&#039;ll have to try exploring life&#039;s natural highs because I just dropped my last £180 on my daughter with pay day very far away. Totally worth it but I&#039;m sure at one point I heard the cash machine let out a quiet cry but it could have been me...
