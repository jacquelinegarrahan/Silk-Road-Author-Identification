				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear All Vendors,<br /><br />Recently as all of you know there has been malicious messages being sent to vendors promising a percentage of Silk Road&#039;s gains if they were to invest, For this reason we have setup a &#039;Donation Fund&#039; for all of the vendors an others who may have lost funds due to these scams.<br /><br />I personally have given back $20,000.00USD to most of the vendors who sent money in hopes of owning a piece of Silk Road, I now ask that if you have an extra .01btc to please help us gain some funds back for all the vendors who lost more then just a few bitcoin&#039;s... One vendor saw it as a long term investment as everyone else an decided to invest $5,000.00USD. So please if you have it to spare then please do, Silk Road would not be here if it was not for these vendors, Some have not been able to re-list their product since they do not have funds since they were scammed.<br /><br />Donation Address:<br /><br />&#039; 1dCoSNazCP4vX5ymozf8wmFVUXpdgCcub &#039;<br /><br />Thank You,<br />DPR<br />Donation Fund<br /><br /><br /><br />Sigh...I sure hope no one falls for this BS.

				Is it me or are the scammers getting more desperate per scam? And asking for less BTC in each scam? What was once asking for 2,3,4 even 5BTC.. they&#039;re now asking for .01BTC?! Wouldn&#039;t it be easier to just go to the &quot;Spare Change&quot; thread and get it legitimately if they&#039;re a few bucks short on their order?! :o

				Well I think asking for 0.01 BTC was a way to make it seem more legitimate.

				Oh I agree. I&#039;m just saying, even the &quot;so if you could just send XYZ amount&quot;, the XYZ has been getting lower each scam. One scam soliciting funds for a bogus charity post the Boston Bombing was asking for like .5BTC. So they&#039;re definetly aiming lower..

				SR has robbed them. They have no choice.<br /><br />What has SR stolen from them, you ask?<br /><br />These desperate broke motherfuckers can no longer offer to suck dick for a hit on a street corner because we all get our drugs delivered and the dealers are sitting at home in their office like businesspeople instead of hustlers. They are no longer merely destitute, they&#039;re destitute with no career.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be angry, just pity them a little.<br /><br />
