				I have a friend (yes a friend, not me) that places orders with super trip all the time. Granted it&#039;s only for a gram or so each time, either coke, or some of his pills. <br /><br />But, he has never had a problem. All packages have shown in like 5 days each time. <br /><br />Supertrips seems to have a kind of bad rep around here and people calling him a scammer, I just wondered is it mainly Aussie, U.S buyers that have no shows? Or is he bad for EU-UK buyers to? <br /><br />Don&#039;t plan on ordering from him but was looking through the main site and this kind of stumbled across my mind.

				Yes that&#039;s right a lot of us people receive their ordering and are happy. But a lot of domestic peoples didn&#039;t get their package. I&#039;m one of this people. Supertrips din&#039;t write one sentce to me as i have wrote him that my package has not shown. No he instruct his Support Stuff not to write with me anymore. I FE because the old prices were under 500 Dollar. I dind&#039;t get a refund or 50 % nothing. Supertrips is a stupid arsehole and i can only warn peoples to buy from this guy
