				So I see that SR added Total Spent in the buyer&#039;s purchasing stats, which should help vendors weed out potentially scam buyers (and I&#039;m not implying that all who do it are) who only buy cheap crap or exchange bc in order to raise their number of transactions. But I&#039;d like to know where SR gets its&#039; total from because I know I&#039;ve spent probably $500 or so more than I&#039;ve been credited with. Is it because I change my SR bitcoin wallet address after every couple of transactions?

				I&#039;m guessing the total spent is calculated based on the number of bitcoins spent instead of the $ amount. Bitcoin prices have dropped a lot in the last day<br /><br />My total spent seems a lot lower than it should be :-\

				Haha you&#039;re not the only one TalkingHead I saw my stats, and was knew it was inaccurate because I had spent more than that.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t even cross my mind that it may be in BTC..&nbsp; I mean after all there is a USD sign next to it&nbsp; :P

				Does anybody know definitively how this stat is calculated? My total spent is way off, and it&#039;s not even the USD -&gt; BTC that could be causing it, it&#039;s like a couple orders of magnitude off.

				I would like to know a bit more about this. I started a thread in the Technical forum about this same topic. I just want to know how its calculated, and for everyone else to know. In my opinion it should be what it says it is. Amount Spent, not amount spent @ the current bitcoin rate.

				It&#039;s pretty surprising to see that people are just now discovering that SR keeps basic information about all of the transactions.<br /><br />I mean, what do you expect? You can go back and edit any of your feedback on any of your transactions. How would that be possible if the transaction wasn&#039;t recorded? <br /><br />I was also surprised at how low my amount was. The lack of historical BTC-&gt;USD data attached to the transactions definitely help explain a lot. It also helps explain why this feature wasn&#039;t rolled out sooner...DPR knew people wouldn&#039;t like the fact that the USD value of old transactions wasn&#039;t being calculated properly, so it&#039;s somewhat of an invalid stat.<br /><br />In fact, without valid USD data, I think it would be a really good idea to change the display to BTC *regardless* of what setting we have set in our account (if you have display prices in $, it shows $, if you have display prices in BTC, it shows BTC).<br />

				Maybe I&#039;m wrong but I don&#039;t think accuracy is that important here, unless you really need to know yourself. I think it&#039;s really so the vendors know that buyers haven&#039;t just inflated their buying stats with multiple bs small time purchases.

				Hi there&nbsp; :),<br /><br />I´m a little bit confused about my purchasing stats. Instead of ~20 transactions only 11 are listed, also my Feedbacks. Refund rate is still correct. Last time I looked at these stats, before a couple of days, everything was correct. I had only 1 order which I never received. Therefore I got a refund, so refund rate was about ~4%. When you look at these stats now, it tells the sellers, that every 3rd order get lost when sending to me. That´s not a good rep for a honest buyer, who I am. Why the half of my stats/Feedbacks are deleted, what happens (My username here is different from my SR)? <br /><br />Thanks for help guys - I love the SR&nbsp; :)<br />Dt67CRD<br />
