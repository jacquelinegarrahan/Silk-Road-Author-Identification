				We&#039;re going to fracture a bit as a community when these forums finally go under. Some of us will go to Sheep market, some of us to Black Market Reloaded, and many to both and many to neither.<br /><br /><br />Could we please stick together on one particular forums though? Here is BMR&#039;s forums:&nbsp; http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/index.php<br /><br />Feel free to double check after creating your BMR buyer account.<br /><br /><br />We need you. Please don&#039;t leave us, the TOR network is safer when we&#039;re greater in number.

That was the reason for a lot of SR&#039;s technical difficulties, trying to deal with the load on the site.<br /><br />I&#039;m tentatively excited to see where this is going. I&#039;m already out the game for a while anyway; spent all my disposable income for quite a while at the beginning of the week, so hopefully something will come through. Other than that I just wait with bated breath.

				I am a vendor, by midday Australian time I was set up on Sheep, by 2pm the messages started coming in- it is now 9pm- barely 24 hours since the closure of SR and 30 loyal customers have messaged me and the orders have started arriving.<br /><br /><br />Sheep is going to be a major meeting point, I am waiting for BMR to accept me as a vendor<br /><br />
