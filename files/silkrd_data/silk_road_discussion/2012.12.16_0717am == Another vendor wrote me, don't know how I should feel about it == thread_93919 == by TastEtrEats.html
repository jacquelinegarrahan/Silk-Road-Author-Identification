				Another vendor wrote me saying I was pretty much fucking the pot market up with my low prices and to do my self a favor and others a favor and raise my prices. I don&#039;t think he is threatening me at least I hope not cause I&#039;m a low key vendor I feel. I haven&#039;t been putting normal listings up just custom listings for my current clients and told them I was looking to get new clients. I don&#039;t want to fuck it up for other pot vendors but I also want to bring affordable products to SR. So I&#039;m thinking about just not accepting new people at all. WHat are others thoughts about what I should do?

				It depends if you&#039;re out to make money and sell pot, or make friends with an anonymous person who you&#039;ll never have any interaction beyond a PM with.<br /><br />If you&#039;re able to provide a product that is as good or better than others, and do it cheaper, then you&#039;re going to be very successful.<br /><br />Ignore the other guy. He&#039;s only interested in protecting his customer base and bottom line, and doesn&#039;t give a rat&#039;s ass about you or the &#039;pot market&#039;.

				FIREHAWK said it all...We only know our fake screen names non of us are RL friends just Virtual , dude is trying to protect his clients from leaving him and him loosing money, so it sounds like he wants u to higher yours and lose yours.. Not cool!!! Tell him to be a cool guy and bring his prices down some if its that big a deal, no one makes someone buy from a vendor, its useually 1st price 2nd communication and being a decent person in PM that goes both ways though, buys dont treat vendors like tools either. this is their living they are men and women working hard, this takes alot of work!!! to be a vendor, show them love and respect..2 way street..

				man fuck him,sounds like he&#039;s hating. IMO like Thumbs said&nbsp; I&#039;d pay a little more for it. maybe do zips for 230 w free shipping and qp&#039;s for like 750-775 and the rest accordingly. and limit your customers. take a few more on and cap it at a reasonable number because once everyone catches wind of your good product they&#039;ll overload you with order possibly causing you to shut down or something.<br /><br />either way I&#039;m glad I made it in as a customer! cant wait to get my first order from you.

				Personally I think price fixing is bullshit and If i catch wind of this vendor trying to organize a price fixing to increase prices i&#039;ll do what i have to to have them banned and those that work with the scheme. It&#039;s underhanded bad business, karma and in the end it will always be undermined so dont do it if you would like to have any business on Silk Road. There are enough customers for all vendors fixing prices will do nothing positive. If you think you can pull it off with me on the case you&#039;ll get tired of trying to get enough feedback on a vendor account top actual make money at the rate you want because your be buying vendor accounts so often you&#039;ll wish you&#039;d had listen to this voice of reason.

				Very well said Bloodbath!!! As i was pretty much trying to say the same in my first post on here.. As well as showing respect for buyers/vendors everyone deserves it. But you have some Kids that get on here and decide this is 4chan or something and wanna troll on the forums, this is a community and we are under watch so lets show people who watch drug buyers and sellers can conduct business with out outrages ,blackmail, etc etc.. We are writing history lets show the world we are just the same if not better than some of the so called &quot;NORMAL&quot; class working citizens out there. As Bloodbath said plenty enough buyers for all..

				Silk Road is not about a world-wide price..<br />it is about a FREE world-wide market..<br />ran by a community... which is run by individuals.<br />each individual has a different taste in something.<br />.. and the point is that this Road is not build on greed..<br />it is built on freedom.. and TT has the freedom to list HIS stuff <br />at whatever price he deems worthy.<br /><br />and i thank you.. from the bottom of my heart and soul for doing what you&#039;re doing.<br />i seriously can&#039;t thank you enough.<br /><br />the Vendor who is messaging you.. has probably<br />never had a customer/client tell them &quot;thank you&quot; and really mean it...<br />in a way beyond a simple gesture of &quot;thanks for the drugs boss.&quot;<br />but instead a genuine &quot;thanks man.. you really just saved my family for Christmas.&quot;-type thank you&#039;s.<br /><br />i appreciate you TT.. you really are one in a million sir.<br />i hope this Christmas is the best Christmas you&#039;ve ever had..<br />and i am honored to be able to buy from you.. and let other people in my area<br />smoke a strain from such a high-class individual/businessman.<br /><br />thanks again for everything TT..<br />and as long as YOU can continue doing YOU..<br />ignore the other Vendors.. because they&#039;re not Vendors..<br />they&#039;re Middle Men.<br /><br />people will understand when they can AFFORD to.<br />until then sit your broke asses down and stop hating on my man..<br />TT is doing what ALL marijuana Vendors should be doing..<br />selling us all PREMIUM, TOP SHELF product at affordable prices.<br />i know what prices are on the West Coast... and people still wanna ignore those prices..<br />like they&#039;ve never heard them before.<br />i could name 10 Vendors right now without even thinking twice..<br />that are here for greed and refuse to work with Buyer&#039;s requests..<br />and they&#039;re not even crazy requests.. they&#039;re completely reasonable.<br />at least my offers are. :) that is why TT fulfilled it!<br />if he can.. i know others can, period.. so why not just do it?<br />the quicker you move your product the faster you&#039;re raking in profits..<br />instead of just slowly selling your shit for big profit.<br />if you really have access to it, fucking move it.. if you don&#039;t.. kick rocks and move.<br /><br />point of my rant is..<br />we, the Respected Buyers, would love more Vendors like TT..<br />he needs help.. he needs competition.. healthy competition.<br />but there is none because no one wants to run a real business..<br />they just want to shaft us for our hard earned money..<br />and make it impossible for us to re-sell..., if we are.<br /><br />sorry for the essay-story book but i really do appreciate you TASTETREATS.<br />you&#039;re doing me a huge favor.. and i am sure i speak on behalf of at least half of the community.<br />thanks TT.. you are a God-send!<br /><br /><br />/thumbs

				All this talk about free market... let&#039;s not forget this is also the black market.<br /><br />Anyways, obviously you don&#039;t know this, but I&#039;ve been a customer of yours for quite some time. Your quality to price ratio is better than any vendor I have seen this past year and I tried all of them in and around your price range. You sell $200/oz which is equal to most of the $300/oz I&#039;ve bought off here. <br /><br />Is this going to piss off other vendors? Obviously.

A SR vendor selling their product at &quot;unreasonably low prices&quot; is hardly, as you put it, a &quot;conglomerate corporation&quot;, not by a long shot. To make a comparison between the two is just ridiculous. This is an anonymous market place, a website on the hidden web, selling mostly illegal items. Vendors will lower prices across the board to attract customers if required or if they have sensational, quality gear, even set a price a little higher than usual. Products sold in real life are given a Recommended Retail Price by the manufacturer to sell to the general public, however, if you can buy in bulk for example, you&#039;ll be able to buy the product at a cheaper wholesale price and either increase your profit margin or offer it at a lower price than your competitors. Competition is what will regulate prices on SR, along with the ability of vendor&#039;s to procure quality product at a reasonable price to then sell to us. I&#039;m not sure what business you&#039;ve been advising for the past 22 years, but judging by your post, they probably haven&#039;t done too well, hence the rant. You sound like you have a communist view to life. If a vendor is able to do things other vendors can&#039;t do, then for me he did his homework, worked hard and made the right decisions at key times. You get out of life what you put into it.

				Let me put it this way,<br /><br />Many bulk weed vendors here are from California. They are selling pounds of their product for 3000, most of the time 3k+. Now i know that even if you do not grow the product yourself, i could get a high quality pound in Calif easily for around 1000. The fact that they are selling them for over 3k is the fucked up situation, especially since many are willing to buy it. Vendor like TT here are truely the ones providing a service... the other vendors with sky high prices are servicing themselves.

I don&#039;t think he is threatening me at least I hope not cause I&#039;m a low key vendor I feel. I haven&#039;t been putting normal listings up just custom listings for my current clients and told them I was looking to get new clients. I don&#039;t want to fuck it up for other pot vendors but I also want to bring affordable products to SR. So I&#039;m thinking about just not accepting new people at all. WHat are others thoughts about what I should do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The other vendor sounds like a dick. Your low prices dont fuck up the market for all the other vendors, your low prices fuck it up for him. If he was on his game he would be doing it right but hes not. You are offering a product people want for less and making money, this is great for everyone except this 1 vendor. So since it benefits both you and your customer fuck him. <br /><br />~Despite your low prices I already got my pot connection on SR. I dont even search for weed because there is only 1 vendor I want to buy from. :)
