				Was on the sesh last night, reading all the newspapers, oddly it&#039;s something I really enjoy doing while off my trolly!<br /><br />I almost spat out my tripe malibu and lemonade when I found this:<br /><br />Deep web: Drugs, guns, assassins, jet planes all for sale on vast anonymous network <br /><br />(clearwebalert) http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/deep-web-drugs-guns-assassins-1337131<br /><br />Interesting read, to quote the report:<br /><br />Half a gram of heroin is 6.75 Bitcoins, just £3.85.<br /><br />How the hell did they work out THAT exchange rate? I want to know who exchanges their BTC ASAP! :)

				I think we should have a team of journos on SR, exposing all the bullshit our governments do and send it to all the news agencies and wake a few people up..<br />That report was quite possibly the shittest written one I&#039;ve seen for SR.<br /><br />&#039;For sale is a staggering array of illegal goods being traded openly online – everything from child pornography or Class-A drugs, to guns and British passports.&#039;<br />Blatant lies and misinformation, this is why i hate mainstream media.

				This is the most well written report iv read so far, not a hint of scaremongering and all based on factual evidence, except the price of limitless land rover, finally mentioned in the news and its price is about £100,000 under, i&#039;ll take two at that price please.<br />I also found the man with the shotgun photo a fair representation of what i think everybody on here looks like, even me.
