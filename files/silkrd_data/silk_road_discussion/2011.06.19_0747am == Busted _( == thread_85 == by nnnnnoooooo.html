				On Friday a friend/coworker were busted for the importation of drugs into the US as a result of using the Silk Road :( <br /><br />i thought that the server outage and site being down was related to this to be honest as the Feds have said that this was a joint operation with Dutch and British authorities (which is where they claim that the silk-road is hosted and operated) and the site is in the process of being closed down<br /><br />he had around $6000 worth of BTC confiscated (the Computer forensics team knew exactly what they were looking for, they took his wallet and wallet backups) and they also took his multiple USB thumb-drive backups which he made after the 500K &quot;hack&quot; hit the news the other day they also took his droid his PS3(?) and his thinkpad.<br /><br />they are in the process of taking down his dwolla account and have already seized his mtgox account by changing the passwords (somehow they&#039;ve snagged his keepass pass which has given them access to everything).<br /><br />they have said that mtgox is specifically set up for money laundering and is also being closed now. they have said that the other trading and exchange sites are next.&nbsp; <br /><br />there seems to be an international task force between multiple countries that are stamping out BTC and international anonymous drug trading :(<br /><br />if I can find out a way to upload documents I can scan in the limited details that I have from the bust.<br /><br />my buddy is still in jail and is being refused a lawyer with the claim of national security or some terrorism bullshit. the same guys tried to scare me by linking me with the sale and the fact that he had sent me a few hundred bitcoins some months back but i did not get arrested yet.<br /><br />i need to get him help and I need to get this out there. i don&#039;t know what to do. i have some (a few hundred) bitcoins and should i send them somewhere else? should I sell them? can i get busted for doing this?<br /><br />this is some george orwell shit going down here.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m also going to chime in to say this is bullshit. LE would not give forewarning that they were going to shut down a site. That&#039;s why they do them all at the same time if there are multiple targets -- for example, Operation Web Tryp or the recent shutdown of online poker sites.
