				gday all found this on the net check it out<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Cyber Attacks From Foreign Government Agencies Aimed At American Citizens……….. Are They Mad About Mushrooms?<br />In #37 TEO August 2011, I wrote an article “When Wrong Laws And Actions Are Made Against Mushrooms”. I also reprinted an article I have ran a few times before “Are Mushroom Laws Too Harsh?”<br />The article goes on to explain about an email I got from someone who lived in Australia. He stated that the authorities there had been watching his emails and postal orders and deliveries. He was planning on doing some mushroom extractions for some of the valuable compounds that can have a worth of over $50,000.00 a gram. None of the involved mushrooms contain any controlled or illegal substances. I might also add that extraction of these said mushroom compounds are absolutely legal. The email goes on to explain, with the information they gathered by watching his email and postal items (glass ware and cultivation books), they were able to secure a warrant and search his home under the suspicion that something illegal was going on. As it turns out, they found nothing illegal going on.<br />During their search, they came upon FMRC’s Mushroom Spore Bank that he had ordered. If you are aware of this collection, you know it is very extensive, and contains a massive number of mushroom spores from all over the world. This would be a very important tool when electing specific mushrooms for their specific, and valuable, compounds.<br />The government of Australia posts a webpage describing mushrooms that are illegal to import into their country. It lists live mushroom cultures that are prohibited, for living on live trees and so forth. It does not place any mushroom spores as illegal, nor does it even mention anything about mushroom spores. Now here is where all this gets interesting. The police said they were taking all the spores, the entire collection. They informed him that any Psilocybe mushroom spores were illegal. They would return all the others. I emailed him the following email. Don’t forget, the authorities are watching his emails….:<br />“When checking mushroom laws given on Australia’s Government Pages (http://www.aqis.gov.au/icon32/asp/ex...eryType=Search), no mention of any mushroom spores are listed. They list certain live cultures on agar and mushroom spawn on sawdust, that are Prohibited. No Psilocybes are even mentioned here. So, it is my thinking that there are no Australian Laws on any Psilocybe spores or any mushroom spores for that fact. However, the email clearly states that the police stated they were illegal. What about all the Psilocybe semilanceata (Liberty Cap) that grow wild right there in Australia? Are people going to jail because they have this mushroom growing in their front yard? Are they not allowed to take any spore prints from these same said mushrooms growing in their yard? And why would they say “No Psilocybes?” Is this because they think all Psilocybe Mushrooms contain the toxins Psilocybin and Psilocin? Mushrooms are not placed in the Genus Psilocybe because they produce these psychoactive toxins; they are placed in Psilocybe because the mushrooms themselves have sterile cells known as “Cystidia”. These are microscopic club-shaped cells with a round head, that appear on the gill’s edge. At one time, Psilocybe cubensis was listed as Stropharia cubensis. Stropharia do not have these sterile cells. So when it was discovered that this mushroom had them, a new genus Psilocybe, was brought about to separate the two. And what about Psilocybe mushrooms that do not produce any psychoactive toxins like Psilocybe montana ( Psilocybe montana: It does not contain toxins, page 248 NORTH AMERICAN MUSHROOMS, by Dr. Orson K. Miller, Jr. 2006). According to what the police stated, these would also be illegal, but why? You mean you could go to jail for a mushroom that did not even have any toxins? That’s pretty bizarre. What’s more bizarre is to name an entire Genus! Its bad enough to just name one mushroom illegal, but an entire Genus? I can’t even positively identify all these mushrooms without appropriate references. I know no common and ordinary person could do such a mycological task. I can say in the utmost of confidence, not one person involved with making these laws can identify all of the species in Psilocybe. And if its Psilocybin and Psilocin producing mushrooms they are trying to make illegal, what about all the other many mushrooms in Panaeolus, or Gymnopilus and other Genera that produce the said toxins? Are they just going to allow those? Can you start to see just how stupid mushroom laws are?”<br />On Oct.18, 2011, I received an email that appeared to be from the postal authorities in Australia. The email address ended with .au, signifying that it was from Australia. It was addressed to floridamycology@cs.com. The text body stated that I had an item of mail that was not deliverable. It stated that I could go to some post office in Australia and pick it up. For more details see the attachment. Oh ohh I thought. This doesn’t make much since. Why and how, do they have my email address? And why would they put details in an attachment and not just put it right on the email? So, I did not dare click on the attachment. I know this is how viruses and worms alike get into your computer. You usually have to click on a URL given, or download and executable code from an attachment. I have a son that works for our government and his specialty is computers, intelligence gathering and hackers, trying to hack in government and defense computers. I spoke with him about the .au email and he told me to forward it to an email address he gave me. He would check it out. Well, this is when things got really suspicious. I was unable to forward the .au email to him. I kept getting a message that things were too busy right now and to try and mail the email at a later time. This went on for 5 days. During all this time, I was able to send many other emails with no problems. We spoke on the phone and agreed that the .au email must have something embedded in it that will not allow it to be forwarded. Why would this be? I told him I was going to contact my service provided Compuserve and see what they could find out.<br />On November 30, 2011, I contacted Compuserve and spoke with Chuck, one of their representatives. He had me open my computer through Internet Explorer, type a few other things, and he was in my computer. I told him about my son and how I could not forwarded the said email to him. Chuck asked me to try and send another forwarded message to him at the given address I had. The trial forward email went right on through. He then put me on hold for a moment. When he came back he told me that “Yes, the attachment contained a virus and if I had opened it, it would have shut my computer down!” He then instructed me to delete the .au email, and I followed his instructions. He stated “You have an enemy somewhere who does not like you.”<br />I am going to pass this information on to the proper authorities. I make this information public to place everyone involved with mushrooms and their biological materials, on alert about this. There appears to be someone, or a group of people in Australia, placed there to rid this terrible scourge of mushrooms. I am thinking they acted on their own and had no permission from higher authority, to do what they did. They may not have liked my response to their actions, was only trying to educate them a little about mushrooms. In any case, it did not call for what they did. I would caution all vendors and others about dealing with mushrooms and the country of Australia. If I lived in Australia, I would not want such people enjoying my money I provide through taxes. I would find somewhere a little more “mushroom friendly”, and move there. I would suggest the state of Florida in America…………..they have no wild mushroom laws. slp/fmrc #37 TEO can currently be read at www.mushroomsfmrc.com and then click (TEO Journals) off of the Main Menu. Scroll down until you come to it.<br />We now know that emails going to Australia are being looked over by authorities. &quot;Hit Words&quot; like mushroom, spores, Psilocybin, and others you can think of, will flag the emails and bring them to their attention. With this knowledge, be safe and don&#039;t cause problems for these people.<br />__________________<br />Mushroom Laws Are Unconstitutional......<br />The Florida State Supreme Court<br />Fisk VS State of Florida&nbsp; on the net and found this at mushroomgeeks
