				Sometimes, we need to move our goodies from place to place.. What do you think would be the best idea for hiding drugs in your car? Take in mind that if the cops have enough suspicion, they&#039;ll dig inside the whole vehicle... &gt;:(

				I always liked getting a container to put my shit in and hide it under my hood, like in the air filter or something. Finding a way to attach it to the underside of the car would be good too. If they have a k-9 your probably fucked no matter what though, but if you&#039;re holding small amounts and don&#039;t get so unlucky as to be pulled over by a k-9 unit in the first place, I think under the hood is pretty safe. Just don&#039;t smoke a blunt in your car if you have shit on you, thats how alot of people fuck themselves over. I remember me and 2 other people got pulled over once and we all had heroin on us. We ALMOST smoked a j before leaving the area we got it from but decided not to because of the risk. God damn were we happy we didn&#039;t. 8)

				Keep a 2 litre of water about 3/4 full in the passenger seat with a funnel. As you are getting pulled over put the mdma/ cocaine/any powder into the water thru the funnel.&nbsp; Keep a second smaller water bottle near by and rinse over the funnel to clear any substance over the floor. Put the 20oz water back in the cup holder&nbsp; Reach around real quick to put the 2 litre on the ground behind the seat and put the full on the other side under the seat. Most people keep water in their car in case the car starts to over heat and is a widely accepted item to have in the car. Cops think nothing of it. this works a lot faster if you have a second person in the car.

His advice is to consent to the search of your vehicle should you get pulled over. If you dont, the cops will get all pissy, say they see red flags and search your vehicle anyways. Possibly getting a dog to false alert on your car.<br /><br />I disagree,. If you consent to any form of a search, you&#039;re totally giving up your rights to search and seizure. <br /><br />He does provide some good avice on hiding though... if it takes you an hour to hide it, its probably going to take the cop 2 hours to find it. I also like the idea of the small trap door in the floorboard, allowing you discard small items out the bottom of the car while still being pulled over.<br /><br />I think someone else mentioned this but, don&#039;t smoke and drive if you got stash. As soon as a cop pulls you over and smells that magical weed smell, you&#039;re at his mercy. If you must travel with drugs, try not to do them as you drive. <br /><br />One last thing that I seem to notice a lot of idiots doing. The bumblefuck who has a pound of crank in the car and gets pulled over for a blown headlamp!@!!@!@!! Seriously, if you&#039;re going to use your car to transport drugs, do yourself a favor and ensure its in good shape and it itself wont get you pulled over. Don&#039;t drive with a car full of passengers (raises eyebrows), dont speed, use blinkers, etc.

				Drug Trafficker lol<br /><br />Hide your stash in the sump, oil proof it 1st and secure away from any moving parts.<br />The heat might damage it though?<br /><br />Or remove the cylinder head and remove one piston and crank arm. Fill the void with drugs.<br /><br />The engine will run a little lumpy and your drugs might cook with the heat or get soaked with fuel if you don&#039;t disconnect the injector.<br />You could, if the engine block is big or strong enough drill some holes in the mating surfaces and put some drugs in here (a few pills maybe) and watch out for the coolant channels.

				Depending on the make/model of the car, the ash tray near the shifter on your center console area might be removable. My Chevy has a metal one that pulls out, and there&#039;s about a 1-2 inch space height wise and maybe 3-4 inch width wise under the ashtray. I usually make sure my weed is well saran wrapped and just put it in there, or keep whatever I&#039;m bringing that night to smoke in the grinder or a pill bottle and just have it out of sight/out of mind type deal. I got pulled over and didn&#039;t stop early enough for the officer&#039;s convenience, and since I stopped in my own driveway he took that as a sign I was fleeing/had drugs. When backup arrived 5 officers looked in the entire front/back seat, looked under every single car mat. The stash spot was pretty much the only place they didn&#039;t look. Luckily I was stone cold sober and it happened to be one of the few times I didn&#039;t have contraband in the vehicle.

				The water idea seems like an alright idea, as long as you&#039;re able to pull it off before the cop walks up. You could also hide it inside of the tire (tape it to the inside). Unless it&#039;s only a little bit of weed though I don&#039;t bring drugs into cars, bikes and buses all day.

				Always been a big fan of hiding in plain sight.&nbsp; Do you think a cop is going to look in the drink cup from Burger King, especially if it is discarded in the back seat along with a bag from there?&nbsp; Possibly, but it is an easy way to hand something off without appearing suspicious, especially if you pretend to take a drink out of it at the time.&nbsp; But there are stash boxes that look like red bull cans, pringles, etc.&nbsp; Had a coffee can that was huge, if you took the top off, all you would see is coffee, but the bottom twisted off to hide shit, a lot of shit.&nbsp; Just put that in a bag with some other grocery items.&nbsp; They also make some that are WD-40 cans, or car oil.&nbsp; &nbsp;A friend has magnetic boxes that he attaches to the bottom of the car, but then you have to get under the car when you want to get it.

				Usually taped inside the spare tyre (as I can fit tyres to rims and do beads on them) shake shake no noise :)<br /><br />otherwise in the boot one of the side panels folds down and can tuck stuff right down and under in a little secret compartment (ford falcon)<br /><br />depends what it is to whether it goes in the tyre or not.

				In my country, cops tend to search after weed and hash only. They just don&#039;t even think on finding other drugs...<br />If I got any drug which can be turned into powder, then mixing them with water is a good idea like, biglubes said, although, I thought about taking a protein powder container, then divide it into 2 spaces. The bottom space will contain the powdered drugs, and the upper space will contain the protein powder. In case cops will open it and ask me what it is, I&#039;ll just tell &#039;em that it is my protein powder (I really take protein shake after the gym&nbsp; :)), and after they&#039;ll taste it they&#039;ll let it go. Do you think it is clever enough?<br /><br />Weed and hash can become a problem if I&#039;m about to transfer large amounts, let&#039;s say from 50+g. Cops know almost every possible corner inside the cars. They know the air filter space, the removable radio space and the glovebox space.<br />Jopular, I don&#039;t wanna hide my stash near the engine, sump, any mechanical parts, because I know very little about them, and I might find my weed damn fried after 2 hours drive...&nbsp; ???<br />The spare tyre, sounds like a good hideout, Meatgrinder. I also, thought about taking my stash, and from the car&#039;s back trunk, stick &#039;em deep inside the back seats, wrapped with polyfill, pillows fill stuff, so it&#039;ll feel soft. In case the cops would try to press on the seats, they won&#039;t feel anything weird inside &#039;em. Does it sounds like a good idea?<br /><br />I have another idea. When me and my friends come back from nature parties, we take all the trash with us, empty bottles, papers, wet wipes, empty snack bags, plastic cups and such things. I can hide my stash inside some bottle or something very common and not suspicious at all like GlassHouse said. When cops will ask me about it, I&#039;ll just tell &#039;em it&#039;s a lot of garbage from the camping we did. Me and my friends can take other people&#039;s trash from the party, so we will have 3-4 trash bags. It&#039;s good because we can keep the nature cleaner&nbsp; :D. If the cops open one of the bags, they&#039;ll just see a lot of trash covered with tons of mud and grass from the nature. I can also, put the toilet papers I wiped my ass with, after the shit I&#039;ve done under a tree, inside the trash bags, so the cops will get nice smell up their nose, in case they&#039;ll open it&nbsp; ;). Actually, I&#039;ll have to smell it when I&#039;ll open the stinky trash bag after the drive, in order to take my stash out, but I don&#039;t mind. If the bags have saved me from going to jail, I don&#039;t care even to touch the shit with a glove or something...&nbsp; :D Does this sound like a good idea?<br /><br />BruceCampbell, thanks for info, I&#039;ll watch &#039;Never Get Busted&#039;. I found it on youtube, is that it? - (CLEARNET) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOKUb0jQko<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the help guys&nbsp; :)<br />BPM

				Just .. &#039;covertly&#039; push your bag next to the greyhound&#039;s storage compartment with your foot (if you&#039;re transporting luggage sized contraband) where the man at the front of the line is taking people&#039;s luggage.&nbsp; It&#039;ll get tossed into the storage compartment like every other piece of luggage, and if/when they find it they have no idea who it belongs to.&nbsp; If it will fit into a back pack then just go onto the bus with the back pack&nbsp; and put it in an upper storage unit far away from where you&#039;re sitting, take a nap, get off at your stop and just snipe it out of that storage unit.&nbsp; People won&#039;t notice or care as most of them are asleep, reading a book, or doing something else to burn the time sitting on a bus.&nbsp; And when the bus makes stops they disembark quickly, so you can get your shit and get off that bus in a snap of a finger without anyone thinking your like trying to hustle off the bus cuz you have something bad on you.<br /><br />It&#039;s best to do it early as soon as the bus arrives before there&#039;s a lineup of people if you&#039;re transporting luggage sized quantities (aka held in the outer compartment of the bus), and to walk away from the line for 5 min or so and just get in line like a regular passenger.<br /><br />The only risk comes to when you get to your destination and have to remove your luggage, but by that time you&#039;ll have long since known if a drug dog was brought to the bus when boarding.<br /><br />IMO greyhounds are the safest method of transporting contraband.&nbsp; Thank you Greyhound !
