				Well, while SR has being down and it&#039;s back up.<br />It gives me several issues that haven&#039;t been fixed yet.<br />In other words, SR even became weirder then while it was online.<br /><br />Accounts that have been locked out, going back to login page while browsing.<br />Are just the &#039;small&#039; things.<br />But why is SR now redirected to another .onion address?<br />I get several errors like this:<br /><br />404 Page Not Found<br />The page you requested was not found.<br /><br />While I wanted to go to this link it first happened to me.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/229<br /><br />I do really appreciate every little thing DPR has to deal with etc.<br />But why is it so tricky right now then?<br />People whose transfer more then 50btc at a time right now don&#039;t get their coins,<br />vendors losing their listings or even go to stealth mode without knowing, you can&#039;t search etc...<br />Those things are part of a bigger something I guess.<br /><br />Remember, we didn&#039;t receive an official update from DPR before there had to be a topic made for it.<br />People have their thoughts now of SR and don&#039;t trust it 100% anymore after a couple of men were arrested by feds and someone killed himself on 25i he bought on SR.<br /><br />Just watch your back and don&#039;t trust anybody.<br /><br />Koelen3.<br />

				I haven&#039;t experienced any problems myself, I usually come on around this time (6am GMT) and have had no problems with connecting and logging in, I only use a handful of vendors I have used for the last 7/8 months or so, haven&#039;t had any problems ordering or with coins. working as good as it ever was for me.<br /><br />have you got a link to these people who have been lifted and the lad who died? it&#039;s worth remembering that drug busts happen IRL too, and I imagine vendors on here sell locally too, as for the lad who died, as horrible as it is, but it sort of goes with the territory, drugs aren&#039;t safe, you have to treat them with respect.

				It is strange....I could not even log in for the forum ......said server did not recognize the request.<br />Then I read this post (not logged in) and it said welcome and I am logged in...weird . <br />Yesterday (EU time)&nbsp; was okay, had access to all....mail, orders etc. but....that stopped in the evening and I am not able to get access till now. <br />Since I got up 3 hours ago (US time 2 AM!!) I am trying to get connected and yes, after 3 hours there it was. Lots of messages, transactions .. COOL<br />BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;after reply to the first message ...you guessed it.....down !!! Cannot send the message let alone read and reply to all the others.<br />And....it is 11AM here so still bedtime for you US&#039;s, it cannot be the traffic that cause the delay or whatever.<br />This is not funny anymore, for sure all problems are not solved at all. <br />When all is &#039;&#039;repaired&#039;&#039; it should work better....at least as before when it was also not really good for a long time but then you could get in after a few attempts.<br /><br />On the rating comment.<br />Its a strange, unfair system.<br />I am a 100 vendor for quite some time now (8 months, 300+ sales) and one customer gave a 4/5 ( the package was later then expected, my fault yeah right.... I control mail service) and my rate went down to 98.8.<br />This is absurd ...it also makes you to give in to demands from customers for a higher refund or so because they can fuck you bad if you don&#039;t.<br />I always say I will not be blackmailed. <br />The one who does that to me will end up on my profile and forums with name, the offer I made, the response and the rating.<br />Of course can never order again<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />
