				Hey yo my bros! I have hella friends and so many people are finding out about the road, good people but my main worry is that a bunch of shady people already know about it is way to leaked and shit might get real if admins aka DPR or whoever it is closes down any new registrations for any new members unless they can prove themselfs with a sample of an actual product they wish to vend first because i have a freind who found out about it through another dude who had been popped because of SR, said LE is on here more than we think.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Vending or buying i dont know but it is a urgent matter they need to take care off or i have fear a mjor bust or sweep might could happen in the near future so be careful people. Shit is getting serious. On another note Cispa will has potential to fuck silkroads shit up so stand up against it. But seriously silkroad you guys need to make a change to making this place not so public at least for a bit. <br /><br />We all want sr to go on for as long as possible please take this into consideration. leo pigs are prick bastards you never know what they got up there sleeve. Just my opinion but sr is becoming highly watched and possibly le can be working on some kind of take down if they can haha ;) Just saying be careful real careful and best of luck. These are not facts but opinions from what i have been researching so feel free to correct me and let me know what you think if i am wrong i am here to learn.&nbsp;

				All it would take is for the DEA or whatever government organization to do is find DPR and throw whatever sentences they can at him to get him to compromise so they could have total access to the servers and I am sure it would take that long for them to build up a decent case.<br /><br />

				This is a well intentioned plan but I am not sure about it. Just because they sell a drug doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t LE. Plus limiting new registrations would hurt current vendors profits. The only real thing we need to worry about is LE posing as vendors, and I&#039;m certain all of the current long time vendors aren&#039;t LE, they&#039;ve made 100s of transactions. Just my take on it.

Like i mentioned before i am here to learn from anyones point of view not flame or cause paranoia. Honestly i dont give a FUCK about the law i aint paranoid i have a legit job, keep everything legal most of the time. just order small amounts of things off here every month or so. So why the fuck am i paranoid. I&#039;m just trying to keep silkroad on for the longest as possible for the vendors changing lifes and keeping it alive. Not saying leo cant be a vendor but we can definitely try to clean it up and find thos scums if they are on here which is a most likely thing. Paranoia can suck a dick in my life i got none because i do nothing to bring it.&nbsp; I found sr from a hacker forum a while back.&nbsp; Just trying to make the road as strong as possible and eliminate all the bullshit, maybe my suggestion isnt the exact right one but someone can remove, add , adjust to make it the most ultimate market ever! Whats you got to say about this man?

				LOL...at OPs thought that the site is blowing up just now. <br /><br />The site has been known to anyone who mattered for over a year now - who gives a shit about when sheeple start to notice something, LE has known about this site since day 1. The problem is, they don&#039;t need to shut it down and they don&#039;t want to. Far better for them to profit off them.<br /><br />See, a lot of you kids on here think the cops are out to bust people - that only applies to a few guys fresh out of the academy. LE is out to make money - ALWAYS. When they bust people, its only so they have an excuse to get a bigger budget, and to steal someone&#039;s shit.<br /><br />This site is no different. If you&#039;re a regular guy selling shit - they&#039;ll order it and have it stolen and ruin your feedback. Then sell it themselves. I&#039;ve gotten attacked numerously on here for simply stating this reality - what does that tell you???<br /><br />

				The nice part with SR is it takes a certain level of intelligence to use it. I bet a very high percentage of the people who have heard about silk road from their friends and shit probably never have and never will buy anything from here due to the cost and process of using BTC, etc. Like others have said too, it really doesn&#039;t matter how many people find out about this site. Even if registrations were to close what would that accomplish? Less buyers and vendors is all I can see happening, and that ain&#039;t what this site is about dammit.

				Silk Road has been &quot;blowing up&quot; for almost a year now. When did that gawker article come out? This place is no secret anymore, people come and go as they please.

				I do not think that they will have enough legal grounds to go after bitcoin exchanges, granted illegal things are being done with bitcoin, bitcoin itself is not an illegal entity, all the exchanges are fairly serious when it comes to AML compliance, hence all the verification processes to raise limits, <br /><br />Plus with the volume of exchanges and amount that the MTGox team clears on a monthly basis I am certain that they can get good enough lawyers to support their case, nah I dont see SR going down from taking BTC out that will be to hard of an angle, <br /><br />Best shot is to find DPR himself or if DPR decides that enough is enough and is done SR is a well thought out project and we are definitely seeing it grow, continuously at that

				I believe that there is a certain trend towards decriminalization anyway.&nbsp; In the US, what with the destruction of Mexico, and our own inability to build prisons fast enough to lock all drug users up, most sane thinkers realize that the &#039;war on drugs&#039; has failed.&nbsp; Even the gawker article and the few nutcase politicians that got excited showed just how little the public cares.<br /><br />Nice thing about us, is that we aren&#039;t on the street corners, we&#039;re mostly--I suspect--white, non-criminal oriented, who had computer skills, and enough snap to figure out TOR and bticoins.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried explaining this to a couple of my friends, and they just get lost trying to understand the technology, and blow it off.<br /><br />I don&#039;t hate cops: they are burdened with this crap also, and would rather be out chasing thugs, rapists, child molestors, than in doing whatever tedious lengthy studying it would take to convict even one of us....jesus, imagine trying to explain just *bitcoins* to a jury, much less TOR.&nbsp; &nbsp;hahaha...&nbsp; <br /><br />No worries here: we meander along, not causing problems anywhere, and even if they did thru some miracle of luck and capitulation by vendors, &#039;bring us down&#039;, who would care?&nbsp; Nobody would give a shit...<br /><br />We just aren&#039;t that big a deal.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t blab in bars, or start thinking you are some kind of criminal genius, and you&#039;ll be fine...

				Wow, the psych profiles that pop up on this thread could populate several novels. There are folks here who really take issue with anyone who talks about cops or governments screwing up SR. You guys get mean.&nbsp; I think that when people show their anger or disgust regarding certain ideas or style of presentation on SR that it most likely indicates fear. Fear that this nice little virtual world( that I wish was real life), will be compromised or just...lost if DPR doesn&#039;t have an heir-apparent.<br />This Dank fellow has obviously been exposed to some bad treatment by LE. Some of you cannot see that he has some legitimate fear. But Dank, if you think the cops here are bad, look at some of the ones in mexico or central america or africa that really are just masquerading uber bad guys who use their uniform to commit atrocities. I know at least one cop and a bunch of prosecuters: LE. We have had conversations regarding the ridiculousness of the war on drugs and the real human toll it takes to keep it going: far worse than legalizing all recreational drugs and treating them like we do alcohol (which can be considered the most dangerous and injurious of all drugs on the planet by measuring direct and indirect deaths, family destruction, etc.) To a person, they all agree that the medical/alcohol model would be an improvement over the current criminalization strategy of minimizing harm from drug use.<br />This poor kid that started this thread is a noobie like me. We don&#039;t have the extensive institutional knowledge that you guys who have been here for a few years (not sure when SR started or whether OVDB was its start). It greatly limits discussion to see you guys attack the more paranoid or nervous ones who pipe up on the forums. BTW, I can&#039;t tell if labeling someone a &quot;troll&quot; means that you think they are LE or just have stupid ideas or that you think they are a total waste of good carbon. I wonder if you will think I&#039;m a troll for trying to defend the rights of any poster without getting attacked. <br />Finally, it does take patience, motivation and relative intelligence to make it onto SR: become a buyer and, especially, to become a vendor. It is possible that a financed LE mole could do it, but would they really be able to do more than get the addresses of a few buyers who order from them? Doubt that would be worth the effort.<br />Now, getting DPR to spill his beans while under &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;: that is what scares me. I think&nbsp; DPR should get a nobel prize for starting and keeping this beautiful thing going. Please, DPR keep good security in mind for all of us. <br />I think I love u <br /><br />

				Mr phubaiblues,<br />&nbsp;You said it exactly right at the end of your statement. It&#039;s the word of mouth that will be our demise. I&#039;ve known about SR for over a year now, and have not told a single friend about it. My wonderful treats all come from &quot;The Kung Fu Ninja Fairy&quot;<br />As i am not a street distributor, the friends i do have that participate (most of them don&#039;t, and have no idea about my many habits&quot;) think that I have a good friend out of town.<br />The first rule about SR is, you don&#039;t talk about SR! The second rule about SR is, you don&#039;t talk about SR!!<br />Talking creates curiosity, curiosity creates popularity, popularity creates inquiry, and inquiry creates mass discovery. Next thing you know, little Timmy down the street OD&#039;s and Dateline is all over that shit.<br />SR should never be discussed in a public setting. why would you go through all the trouble to maintain your Anonymity, if your just going to blab about it anyway. That is the quickest and easiest way to get caught with anything in life. You wouldn&#039;t go around talking about the person who sold you your goods before SR would you? Then why would this be any different. Besides the fact that your local post office is now handling everybody&#039;s goods instead of just your own (that&#039;s a lot of packages, which increases the likely hood of discovery). It&#039;s just common sense (at least where I grew up) to keep ones mouth shut.<br />I hate those kids that upon meeting you begin to tell you about &quot;who they know&quot;. Like this is going to buy them so fucking&nbsp; street cred or some shit. when you know if they called the people &quot;they know&quot;, that person wouldn&#039;t answer their call (because they probably know dude runs his mouth).<br />I guess what I&#039;m saying is, SR should be discovered by each person on their own. Perhaps they read a random artical about &quot;the Amazon of Drugs&quot; and begin their own mystery hunt. that&#039;s how i discovered it. I felt like i had just found the Lost Arc. Like I had discovered masturbation again for the first time. And as much as I wanted to shout it from the rooftops, and show all my &quot;cool friends&quot; my new discovery. I kept SR to myself. Now,&nbsp; about once every couple weeks I take everybody&#039;s order and make a trip to &quot;My Good Friend out of town&quot; (SR). I order everything we&#039;d like, and in a week or so were all happy and no one is the wiser. And my local post office isn&#039;t flooded with constant questionable traffic.<br />Anyways, that&#039;s my take on the subject, but then again what do i know.<br />~DICK~

				<br />As a newbie to Tor I think it&#039;s safe to say that Silkroad will be getting alot more traffic from now on, it&#039;s the general consensus that the regular web has become stifled and irrelevant.<br /><br />Tor should be used as standard, I&#039;m guessing longterm users of Tor might see that as a bad thing, as if they need to protect their baby, but people are &#039;waking up&#039; exponentially and this can only be a good thing.

				Until something really bad happens, we just won&#039;t know who had the best insights to it all.&nbsp; Whether we believe that LE is everywhere or nowhere or somewhere in between, seems to depend on personality more than any real &#039;proof&#039;.&nbsp; I try to protect my shit as best I can, but make my own decisions.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like being shouted at on here or in Real Life, and it&#039;s never convinced me of anything.<br /><br />It&#039;s an interesting place to be--legally speaking.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do think it&#039;ll be some kind of postal inspector, concentrated effort.&nbsp; The curse for us, is that no matter which theory, or even &#039;attitude&#039; we embrace, we just won&#039;t know until there is a big bust.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine that there isn&#039;t *some* form of LE presence on this site, but after that it&#039;s just speculation.&nbsp; Just because I don&#039;t like somebody, or don&#039;t like the way they do business, doesn&#039;t mean I think they are a cop.<br /><br />I know that cops can sell dope, for sure, but most of what I read, and hear about, is that it is a very tricky thing, and they have to be oh so careful, or it&#039;s entrapment, or it can come back and bite them,&nbsp; u know, if somebody o.d.&#039;s...<br /><br />I know not to do the crime if I can&#039;t do the time, and to bite my tongue if it/when it all goes south.&nbsp; But how and when that will happen is anybody&#039;s guess.&nbsp; Most of these hypothetical cases seem to me that they would be incredibly hard to prove in court, on the other hand, if all they want to do is just &#039;bring the site down,&#039; then yeah, corrupt/compromise a few big vendors, have a very public bust of bunches of people--buyers or sellers--and that might scare the place enough to fall apart, and that&#039;s probably, one way or another, how it will all end.<br /><br />And most people talk and most people plea bargain, so it would be a rare case that they&#039;d probably actually have to fight in court.<br /><br />We&#039;ll see, but until it happens, one guess is as good as another...

				Maybe close registration for a while, and make it so that it&#039;s referral only?

				I found this place thru all those big stories in the mags. Gotta tell you, was a bit disappointed when I realize there are so few vendors :( Have they all gone away because of these mag articles or what. I hope things will get better here. At the time I would have been a buyer, but in the fall things might be a bit different.

				I just read this thread and loled everywhere.<br /><br />You guys are doing exactly what the LE wants you to do... Point fingers and scream LEO!&nbsp; Get you all paranoid they play off of that.<br /><br />An old underground hacking forum/CC theft had an LEO that had been ranked and extremely reputable for 4 years on the forum.&nbsp; One of the admins tracked his IP to a federal building one time called him out then the LEO talked his way out of it somehow and got everyone paranoid about the admin being an LEO.<br /><br />Well the forum went on for a year longer, then the admins friend got caught with credit card theft and snitched the admin out.&nbsp; <br />They later interviewed the LEO who laughed about his situation of being called out.<br /><br />Moral of the story... The police couldn&#039;t shut down that forum or even figure shit out for 5 years while watching it.<br /><br />In the end if SR goes down or DPR it&#039;s going to be because of a snitch that&#039;s all law enforcement has to work off of.&nbsp; That&#039;s all LE has ever worked off of with success.<br /><br />The only practical thing I can think of is they&#039;re going to sit at the addresses that a vendor ships from and hope to god it&#039;s not a fake return or track it back to the drop box and sit for days hoping the shipper doesn&#039;t bounce around.<br /><br />Even an IP track and mac address really isn&#039;t enough for a DA to be like &quot;yep we can def press charges&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t point fingers at one another unless you have proof.&nbsp; We&#039;re all paranoid fucks when it comes down to it I realize that... But don&#039;t give the LE what they want.<br /><br />Keep what you do secret to the people around you.&nbsp; If you get popped that&#039;s why you&#039;re getting popped.<br /><br />DEA will be assigned to this place with maybe some help from HLS if I were to guess just due to international orders and what not...&nbsp; HLS has an extremely large amount of survalance technology... Yet they do have much bigger issues at hand right now...&nbsp; Yet SR caught the eyes of a federal senator... Due to you buyers getting popped and SNITCHING (once again the only reason LE figures anything out).&nbsp; Yet that was to be suspected out of your local crack head who discoved SR ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />Breathe easy guys and cover your tracks.&nbsp; They&#039;re not after the dealers on the site.&nbsp; They&#039;re after the site itself.

PGP or cascading your hard drive, booting from Liberte or similar etc..) <br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t mean information sharing as in the 3rd party type we all use Tor to circumvent...I mean say X people know about/use SR regularly.&nbsp; In y days, (on average) X is likely to tell say 2 people about SR lets make that variable Z <br />X=people who already know of SR and use it regularly<br /><br />(Z=the number people (X) tell about SR in Y days). <br />(Y=Duration of growth margin, or put simply, the time-span were using to determine a &quot;growth period&#039;....I used 30 days for this example....thats a LARGE period, because I&#039;m trying to keep arguments like, I only have a few friends or I don&#039;t talk to people about SR in mind...)<br /><br />Here&#039;s the formula for growth in 30 days....&nbsp; <br /><br />Number of Total People as estimate pulled out of my ass....5,000(X)<br />If 5,000 people tell 2 people in 30 days now 10,000 people know about Sr.&nbsp; Lets say of those 2 new people only half actually start using it....<br /><br />now SR=7,500<br /><br />Another month...<br />11,250<br /><br />Another.....16,825.....At this point on average, per user 2.5 people start to hear about it per month...<br /><br />In two months the SR population has more than doubled, and the plugin values I used (30 days, 2 people finding out, and only 1 of those 2 people actually using SR) are extremely lenient for measuring a data based services growth.&nbsp; It should really be like .20 people in every 2 days, but I&#039;m being lazy :)...Reagrdless, based on this model you can see that the population grows more or less exponentially....Now for a service like this (vs. say google which isn&#039;t illegal under state/federal laws to use :) .....you have to put some sort of ceiling on the growth because not EVERYONE uses drugs.&nbsp; Lets say 15 percent of people use drugs worldwide, again *cough* a very lenient estimate....and that of that minority, only 60 percent of drug users have access to both the internet and mail services.&nbsp; So 60 percent .&nbsp; Multiply and that&#039;s roughly 9 percent of the world population.&nbsp; That would be the growth ceiling for NON LEO....<br /><br />My point is, ideas, services, information spread like fucking wild fires in a California Summer these days.&nbsp; I think DPR is killer bad-ass and I&#039;m sure he/she... has plenty of safeguards, so for the time being I&#039;m not concerned...but this is a valid and well received concern , at least in my not so humble opinion.<br /><br />Anyone who isn&#039;t at all worried about SR eventually blowing up is either clinically ill or an imbecile.&nbsp; Flat out, you can quote me on that....<br />That&#039;s not to say that safeguards cannot be put up as SR grows in such a way that SR stays safe, and stays open.<br /><br />We all have cognitive defenses for things like this, but fuck that, you should always be able to look past those defenses if you&#039;re going to assess the issue at hand in a reasonably unbiased fashion...And by calling OP names you&#039;re not only ignoring the point, you&#039;re just deflecting your own insecurity and probably aren&#039;t even aware of it in the first place...so for those of you who did, go get real with yourself and figure out why you have to resort to name calling...<br /><br />Trey Wingo, out....<br /><br />FOR LEO, you would have to have a separate growth model and I&#039;m too lazy to type something up.

				The more you learn about Tor, anonymous web activity, staying safe online, and the dangers of sending dope through the mail, the more paranoid you become.&nbsp; There&#039;s a constant movement of people coming and going here on SR, and most of the sellers that were here last year have moved on.&nbsp; Same with a lot of buyers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Silk Road himself made a post last year about what I think he referred to as &quot;vendor churn.&quot;&nbsp; New vendors start out working hard to make a rep for themselves. Even if they&#039;re successful they usually get worn down by the work, and they worry more and more about what might happen if they&#039;re caught.&nbsp; Eventually, many decide it&#039;s not worth it and move on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Estimates about the membership numbers of SR should try to take into account how many people are leaving.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m totally with the idea of creating a system where a person needs a reference code(from a higher up of course) to register to this site.<br />Start putting honeypots all over the network, stronger encryption keys, don&#039;t accept P.O boxes and shipment recipients and we should set up a system where every vendor/seller has to do a full background check on any shipping address and name provided. <br />I&#039;m trying to think of more ideas so I&#039;ll follow up on this but the person who started this post is right, we need to start putting our minds together and thinking of more ways to protect this site. I know there&#039;s a lot of tech-saavy people on this site and if we make further initiative we can constantly find ways of increasing our security. Take some tips from torrent websites if the techs haven&#039;t already, no running off US servers, etc. We got this guys. And by ALL MEANS sellers and buyers protect yourselves, as long as there&#039;s no reason of suspicion among the sending and return addresses the police cannot get warrants to open the packages.<br />We should use code names and start using a new type of lingo. For example instead of saying: 100ug tabs say 100lb weights, or something like that. Seeing that there&#039;s probably leos on this site already do not post the codenames on the site. I&#039;m really trying to think hard on this one so bare with me, I joined this site a week ago and I was astonished by how brazenly people discuss and reveal the details of what&#039;s going on around here. Start treating this system as a front business instead of purely relying on our network and encryption security. Perhaps it&#039;s time to start a new site soon. We could somehow slowly and safely integrate into that one. <br /><br />These are all ideas, some of them probably sound stupid or crazy, and I might not know what I&#039;m talking about as well as I think I do, but this site is stupid and crazy, so we need to get stupid and crazy.<br /><br /><br />

				Regarding the fact that the government setup TOR, where are our ace programmers at to figure this one out? Isn&#039;t it possible that we create our own program that works like TOR? If we create a program of our own we can track all the computers that are going through our networks. It may be too difficult, but I feel like some real pros could do it. I&#039;m currently a quarter-way through my IT degree and will probably continue on so when I become more knowledgeable I will help all I can.

				So you telling people the high rated sellers wasn&#039;t anything to do with you thinking that might be a good way to steal custom then? Wasn&#039;t said in any way in hope that other buyers might listen to you and it could attract you sales? Hmmmm....
