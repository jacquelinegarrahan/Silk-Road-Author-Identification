				Hi,<br />This question is to experienced SR users, that are offering help not criticism.<br />I am new to SR. i joined last week, got my bit coins on friday, logged into see how much my purchase was going to be, sent my btc to sr, tried to login and the site was down. Over the weekend i had faith the site would be up sometime this week so I went to buy more bitcoins from my supplier (canadianbitcoins.com) I then purchased more and had them directly send it from them to my SR wallet instead of putting it into my e-wallet. The site came up but I found my coins were short by about $150CAD. Ive tried the &#039;contact us&#039; on SR but have got no reply. Basically I am wondering is that the correct way to go about contacting the main guys to talk to them about how I can get the proper amount of btc that I have paid and transfered into my SR wallet. Like I said I am new, this was going to be my first purchase, and fuck, this is a lot harder than I expected it would be to get some product off SR to try a new method of getting supplied for the business I run on the streets. I have been very patient I hanvt once said stupid comments and have waited for updates from the team without commenting stupid shit. I just dunno how the proper, easiest, and fastest way to go about talking to the team to get my money right. For a first time user with all this problems its hard to sit back any longer without knowing where my money is. Unlike a lot of the users ive sat back and waited for things to happen but when it comes to my money I cannot be so patient and wait, because who knows maybe if i do not act upon this issue in a timely manner the longer I wait the more problems may occur trying to get that money back. Any advice from people who know whats up not stupid comments from crackheads or meth heads would be greatly appreciated.<br />Your man and street king, Bossbusta.

				Hello,<br /><br />others are also currently in your situation regarding deposits made right before/during the downtime. DPR (admin) should be posting an update soon. Until them, the &quot;Contact Us&quot; button is the best way to get in touch with staff. At the moment, latest news by contacting support was to &quot;hang in there&quot;. This was yesterday.

				You may want to check out the &quot;Sent&quot; tab in your inbox, There you can see if they have read your message or not. Also, Silkroad has been going through some problems lately, You can read more about these in the &quot;Update&quot; topic. It should be the first topic in Silk Road discussion.

				thank you for the quick responses,<br />i have loooked in my sent box and it says the message has been &#039;unread&#039; i know these guys are probably getting messaged by every possible user as thats why it hasnt been responded to yet. i just find it odd how most of my money made it to the account yet just a fraction of it didnt.
