				Hey i&#039;m new to SR and have recently joined. I made an order with a UK seller called &#039;no sticks no seeds&#039;. As i&#039;m new he asked me to FE and I agreed as he had very good feedback ratings. However, since I FE&#039;d he has stopped messaging me and now he won&#039;t communicate with me to confirm if he has received payment. I would be shocked if I was scammed for 4 bitcoins but the lack of communication is making me think he won&#039;t be shipping my order. What can I do as he won&#039;t respond and I have stupidly FE&#039;d. I won&#039;t be doing that with future orders. I&#039;ve already received 2 other orders from 2 different vendors without problem. <br /><br />Any advice is much appreciated.

				While I&#039;ve never bought from this vendor before - he has very good rankings so I doubt he&#039;d scam you as that would be detrimental to him. So if you don&#039;t receive the order then you can always go back to amend your feedback rating and comment for other buyers to see.<br />&nbsp;You don&#039;t need to contact vendors to ask if they have received payment - imagine if all say 300 customers did that! So that&#039;s prob why you haven&#039;t heard back.<br />I&#039;m pretty sure your order will arrive soon even with the Xmas rush.<br /><br />I would read up about FE on the forums as well. Build up your stats of successful orders by making purchases from vendors who allow ESCROW for new buyers.

				I have successfully received orders from this vendor twice. The first was I think my third or fourth ever order on SR so he asked me to FE. He didn&#039;t the second time. Everything went okay. I wouldn&#039;t worry, you&#039;re very likely to get your order.

				So if you don&#039;t receive the order then you can always go back to amend your feedback rating and comment for other buyers to see. Has your order been marked in transit the vendor will just consider you kn ow the package is on the way, if you read before your purchase you would of found many threads about NO TO FE. There are many vendors here that will allow the use of escrow even for new buyers. You have put faith in this vendor i suggest reading their profile page in reference to shipping times then wait patiently and if you exceed this time ( give or take a couple days then start communication with the vendor)

				Thanks for your responses guys. I should have done some more reading about FE&#039;ing, even when a vendor seems trustworthy from there feedback.<br /><br />He has contacted me now saying it&#039;s on it&#039;s way, although i&#039;ve completed (i.e placing &amp; receiving) several other orders from vendors who did not ask to be FE and those all went smoothly.<br /><br />I&#039;ll hope he keeps to his word &amp; has posted the goods. Even if not, i&#039;ve learnt a lesson about FE&#039;ing either way.<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; :)

				There have been accusations about selective scamming by NSNS however most seem to recive their order after a delay. Many new buyers get worried because they have to FE though.<br /><br />If you are a new buyer i sell weed in the UK and do not require buyers to FE.

				I think it&#039;s a SR rite of passage to get FE-scammed when you&#039;re new. It happened to me. Chalk it up to a hard lesson learned. As others above said, simply DON&#039;T FE ever, and your money remains protected. Don&#039;t be over-eager and purchase from a vendor who requires FE. There are vendors who are kind to noobs.
