				<br />What I don;t understand for all those people who say this is so great, such a wonderful community, such good vibes etc.<br />Still I see on the forum so much hate, trolling, try to put&nbsp; learning new ones down by being just plain rude the minute a poor sucker dare to ask a question. <br />Hey you stupid fuck, that is already in the faq, how dare you to ask something so ...bla bla you are an idiot, we will give you -1,2 or 3 karma. THAT WILL MAKE YOU LEARN and now bugger off and don&#039;t you dare bother us fantastic, know it all, very serious, successful vendors.<br />Sound strange, ask any new guy ....he does not even really ask,,,just saying &#039;&#039;i wonder how to do this, I will stay here and see what I can learn from all the wise vendors&#039;&#039;&nbsp; <br />It is like dropping a piece of fish in my piranha tank. I swear the trolling &#039;&#039;old&#039;&#039; vendors smell blood and you&#039;re fucked, you never know what hit you.<br />I don&#039;t care but....I made a mistake in the subject line, quite/quit.<br />How is it possible that I see all the messages back an forth of how stupid this is bla bla bla ha ha ha ....<br />AND NO ONE GIVE ME A LITTLE MESSAGE, HEY BUDDY, NOT QUITE CORRECT.&nbsp; ah, you are not American, no problem buddy my German is not that good either.<br /><br />The ones with the big, arrogant attitude about asking questions that are already in the faq or where ever. <br />How dare you to begin with stupid ass!! We have so&nbsp; much better things to do than to answer a stupid newbie questions.<br />Here - 1, 2 or 3 karma. <br />Newbie:...huh, I did not even asked a question.Just came here to see what was going on and made a remark how much I need to learn and how I think I want to do.... need to etc etc. ,<br />Go look in the faq you stupid idiot ( I really have&nbsp; messages saying this) and&nbsp; like I said I am a vendor for a long time and did not even asked a question. The nice person saying that to me thought I was new because I only have a forum name.<br />From one came the other and in no time I had -6 karma....not give a damn because I am never here anyway, only to check why something is not working or why something is compromised .<br />Again, I don&#039;t care, I have my shit together, always sold out before new comes in....so i say ....pretty successful.<br />For all those who think they are so much better than the idiots that also want to start as a vendor.<br />&nbsp;Wenever....1 year, 2 years or 9 months ago you started a sellers account, try to figure out that very strange thing called bitcoins.<br />How the fuck do I get the listing up....oohh fuck, all was okay and then i had to put in postage and now I can start all over...fuck LOL How do I get that photo to fit in....shit, to big, to small, mmmnnn nothing etc etc.<br />I am sure all of you had that situation ...no problem, you were new.<br />So with that thought in mind....all the oldies....you never went to the forum and asked hey guys....this is fucked up, how do I fix that?<br />But, now new people come in, jesus how can I get started here, where to get my coins how to etc etc.<br />So , nice buyers guide....all there.<br />I am sure you asked other vendors in stead of looking at the guide. Why? it is so much nicer to talk to people who&#039;ve done it all, know what you&#039;ve been going through so.....<br />Now, the atmosphere is you have a QUESTION ??????????&nbsp; A BIT LIKE THE WALL FROM PINK \FLOYD<br />FEELINGS....YOU HAVE FEELINGS....LOOK EVERY BODY...HE HAS FEELINGS !!!!<br />Reaction, names called...idiot, moron imbecile. When you have no clue fuck off, we don&#039;t need people like you who think they can just come in and sell. I swear the remark was &#039;&#039;I wonder if I do this or that, what would be the best way to get cheap bitcoins&#039;&#039;<br /><br />This is exactly as this, to stupid for words but so true.<br />You, a strange big city, you stand on the streetcorner....so busy everybody is running and know exactly where they go.<br />Hey mister can you please (very polite) tell me where or how do I get to ....Johnsonstreet.<br />He looks at you, you can see and.... oh oh what did i do wrong?<br />What fucking moron are you, coming here to my city don&#039;t know shit, idiot, don;t you know anything coming here like this just be here ask fucking questions. If you wanna know how to get to Johnson street buy a fucking map/ city guide you stupid ass.<br />Just to make sure what a stupid fuck you are we give on your forhead 1, 2 or 3 minus marks so everybody can see what an ass you are....<br />Hey guys...look, he asked !!!!! us....the elite. Try to get a piece of our shit<br />Fuck, coming here ask how to get to Johnson street....go away and if you figured it out come back and be very very humble because you are nothing to us, only try to get a piece of our business.<br /><br />If we can make you leave the more customers will be ours.<br />&nbsp;That is also why we have made &#039;&#039;trolling&#039;&#039; an art form<br />So we can -without any warning- make a fool of somebody who made a mistake ....that way he feels bad(if he care) and we...well our friends will say how great and intelligent we are to troll this person.<br />A normal person, not aware that you have to mind your words very carefully or they will use your &#039;&#039;weakness&#039;&#039; and scrutinize you in front of the forum community. <br />Well, I am sure although a long message it&nbsp; made it clear and there will be ridicule for sure but I don&#039;t write this for me, I have a very thick skin:-))<br />I hope new vendors will feel a bit more welcome when you think how it was when you started....and of course asked for Johnsonstreet<br /><br />Just think<br />Even as a foreigner I have been ridiculed for my grammar....how is you German? Spanish....&nbsp; <br />that means that I have to take classes to be able/ have permission to write here or don;t write at all...(what some would think is the best thingLOL)

				Jesse<br />Silk Road Forums<br />22 December 2012<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why people say this is such a great, wonderful community with good vibes. <br />On this forum I see so much hate, trolling, and demeaning of new members the moment they dare ask a question, when they are only trying to learn and be a part of the community.<br /><br />&quot;Hey you stupid fuck, that is already in the FAQ!&quot;<br />&quot;How dare you to ask something so...&quot;<br />&quot;You are an idiot, so we will give you -1, -2, or even -3 karma! THAT will make you LEARN. Now bugger off and don&#039;t dare bother us fantastic, sentient beings of glory with another millisecond of your petty dribble. We are very serious, successful vendors and don&#039;t have time for this nonsense.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; Sound strange? Ask any new guy, it is like dropping a piece of flesh in a piranha tank; where the vendors smell blood and then you&#039;re fucked and never even know what hit you. Personally, I don&#039;t care but I once made a mistake in the subject line of a thread (quite/quit) and experienced this first hand. How is it possible that everyone messages back and forth about how stupid a simple mistake is, yet NO ONE says &quot;Hey buddy, I think you meant &quot;quite&quot;, not &quot;quit.&quot;&quot; &quot;Ah, so you aren&#039;t an American? No problem, for my German is not that good either.&quot; Those are the users with big, arrogant attitudes regarding questions that are already in the FAQ or elsewhere on the forum who spew hateful messages because they deem the question of someone merely trying to learn a &quot;newbie question.&quot; So then they send their -1, -2, or -3 karma.<br /><br />Here is an excellent example of what I mean:<br />Newbie: Huh, I did not even ask a question. I just came to this thread to see what all the hubbub was about and chose to make a remark about how much I needed to learn and what my future aspirations are as a member of this forum.<br />Old User: Go look in the FAQ you stupid idiot! (&lt;- this was actually said)<br /><br />&nbsp; The user who said that to me only thought I was new because I had a new forum name, but I am actually an experienced vendor. From no corners of the thread came any helpful responses, and I was left with -6 karma; not that I give a damn because I never am here anyways, but just to check why something is not working as it should or why something is compromised. Once again, I really don&#039;t care. I have my shit together and always sold out of my stock before new product comes in, so I can say I&#039;m pretty successful. For all of you who think they are so much better than the idiots that want to start as a new vendor I ask that you think back to when you first became a vendor. Be it 1 year, 2 years, or 9 months ago when you started a seller account, trying to figure out the strange thing that we call Bitcoins. &quot;How in the fuck do I get my listing up? Ohhh fuck, all is ok I just had to put in postage but now I have to start all over... fuck me.&quot; or &quot;How do I get that photo to fit in..? Ah shit it&#039;s too big, now to small, mmmm just right (think Goldilocks and the Three Bears).&quot;<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m sure all of you have been in that situation at one point in your lives, you were new to the world of Silk Road. Staring wide eyed at everything like a child in a candy store viewing all the delectable sweets laid before your eyes. So with that thought in mind, all you old heads, did you never go to the forum and ask &quot;Hey guys, X is fucked up, how do I fix it?&quot; But now when new people come in asking how they can get started here or where to get Bitcoins they are shot down. I am sure you&#039;ve all asked other vendors instead of looking at the Buyer&#039;s Guide before. But why? I&#039;ll tell you why, it&#039;s because it is so much nicer to talk to people who have done it all and know what you&#039;ve been going through. I&#039;d like to quote a segment from Pink Floyd&#039;s &quot;The Trial,&quot; as I feel it represents this forum&#039;s response to a newbie&#039;s question:<br /><br />The prisoner who now stands before you<br />Was caught red-handed showing feelings<br />Showing feelings of an almost human nature;<br />This will not do.<br />Call the schoolmaster!<br /><br />&nbsp; Reactions of &quot;idiot,&quot; &quot;moron,&quot; &quot;imbecile&quot; fill the air. &quot;When you have no clue, fuck off! We don&#039;t need people like you who think they can just come in and sell!&quot; I swear the question was &quot;I wonder if I choose if I should choose X or Y, what would be the best way to get cheap bitcoins?&quot; This is exchange is exactly as it sounds, to stupid for words but oh so true.<br />&nbsp; Imagine, you, in a big, strange city (think New York). You stand on a street corner surrounded by the hustle and bustle of city life. Everybody is running and know exactly which way they need to go and how to get there. You stop a passerby and in your most polite and well meaning way say &quot;Could you please tell me how to get to Johnson Street?&quot; Well this isn&#039;t going to fly with him, he looks at you and you can see a rage building in his eyes &quot;Uh oh, what did I do wrong?&quot; you think. Before you have a chance to make sense of things he spits back with the fury of a thousand fire ants, &quot;What a FOOKING moron you are, coming here in to MY city, you don&#039;t know shit you idiot. What are you a fucking tourist going around asking fucking questions? If you want to know how to get to Johnson Street go buy a fucking map you ass. You know what, just to make sure everyone knows what a stupid fuck you are lets brand you on your forehead with -1, -2, or even -3 marks.&quot; He begins stopping other passerbys and continues his tirade of hate, &quot;Hey guys! He asked us, the ELITE, how to get to Johnson Street.&quot; He quickly turns his body back to you and presses on &quot;Go away and if you manage to figure it out then you can come back but you better be very, very humble because you are nothing to us. You are only here trying to get a piece of our business! If we make you leave then we will have more customers to ourselves. This is also why we have made &quot;trolling&quot; and art form. With this we can make a fool of somebody who has made a mistake so he feels the bad feels and our friends will say how great and intelligent we all are for having trolled this person.&quot; <br />&nbsp; Now a normal person, unaware that you must pay attention to your words very carefully or risk them being used as a &quot;weakness&quot; to scrutinize you in front of the whole forum community will not know of this trap and can easily fall into it. I am sure this is quite a long message however I hope I have made it clear of the situation. I also am well aware that there will be ridicule of this post for sure but I am not writing this for me, I am no hero, I am writing this for all of the other new users out there. This is not the post this forum deserves, but it is the one it needs. <br /><br />&nbsp; I hope new vendors will feel a bit more welcome when you think back to how it was when you first started, and of course asked for directions to Johnson Street.

The only way to be as informed as possible is to do your own research and ask questions about the parts you don&#039;t understand, have dialog with more experienced users and learn from them and keep learning.<br /><br />As a new member, if someone else tells you exactly what to do then you have learned nothing, you are checking things off a checklist.&nbsp; My position is that everyone needs to make their own checklist.&nbsp; I will help anyone who is trying to help themselves, those who say I have done X, Y &amp; Z but F keeps happening - I will help those people.&nbsp; The others, the ones who want to do nothing for themselves:&nbsp; I spent two solid months here learning how to buy safely and&nbsp; I do not feel an obligation to share everything I know with those members whose behaviour I think is reckless. <br /><br />Lastly,&nbsp; SR is not a game.&nbsp; It&#039;s serious business with very serious consequences - our freedom is at risk every time we make a transaction here.&nbsp; This is not a social media site.&nbsp; It&#039;s a drugs site.&nbsp; Ignorance and stupidity put the entire community at risk. If members are acting stupid then someone needs to get their attention. If that means calling someone an asshole then so be it.<br /><br />Thank you for the karma and happy holidays,<br />/w

ADULT ?<br /><br />When you read the thread maybe you think, (well I hope you do anyway)....am I also such an ass? Until now yes, but you can change if you want and be an asset to SR to make this a trusted and loyal community.<br /><br />And, just for fun, to show that you can, give a + to make up for the - you just gave me LOL<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dear jesse,<br /><br />I do not give negative karma. <br /><br />You have done nothing but complain since you got here.&nbsp; If you are trying to voice an opinion I&#039;m hearing only complaints and dissatisfaction so I was simply pointing out that if you are so unhappy here because people are arrogant and mean, then perhaps you might be happier some place else:&nbsp; BMR or another site. <br /><br />Another thing to point out is this:&nbsp; When new people come here and expect to be spoonfed all of the information they need to make a purchase it is dangerous for all of us.&nbsp; In my opinion, users of this site have a responsibility to themselves and to the community to be informed and to understand how to limit the risks of what we do here. The only way to be as informed as possible is to do your own research and ask questions about the parts you don&#039;t understand, have dialog with more experienced users and learn from them and keep learning.<br /><br />As a new member, if someone else tells you exactly what to do then you have learned nothing, you are checking things off a checklist.&nbsp; My position is that everyone needs to make their own checklist.&nbsp; I will help anyone who is trying to help themselves, those who say I have done X, Y &amp; Z but F keeps happening - I will help those people.&nbsp; The others, the ones who want to do nothing for themselves:&nbsp; I spent two solid months here learning how to buy safely and&nbsp; I do not feel an obligation to share everything I know with those members whose behaviour I think is reckless. <br /><br />Lastly,&nbsp; SR is not a game.&nbsp; It&#039;s serious business with very serious consequences - our freedom is at risk every time we make a transaction here.&nbsp; This is not a social media site.&nbsp; It&#039;s a drugs site.&nbsp; Ignorance and stupidity put the entire community at risk. If members are acting stupid then someone needs to get their attention. If that means calling someone an asshole then so be it.<br /><br />Thank you for the karma and happy holidays,<br />/w<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wintermoon why are you such an asshole, not enough attention when little? Get a life. When you have nothing to do ...don&#039;t do it here.<br />SR does not need 16yo adolescents pretending being adults.<br />Another thread, karma, Wikked fuck fuck fuck...la la la la la<br />Stop pestering people

Does this mean you will give -K to people who haven&#039;t even heard of you? Or even people who&#039;ve given you +K? If you do that, no one will want to talk to you.<br /><br />As a rule, it isn&#039;t wise to start a war with SR members who may not even be involved in this issue.
