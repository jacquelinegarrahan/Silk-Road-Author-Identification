				The thing that worries me about the BTC deposit/withrawal freeze right now is the inordinate amount and sheer ammount of accounts holding almost exactly 50 BTC. SR would not use any sort of these addresses for tumbling, this would throw up a red flag. A similar situation happened about a year ago, but it was 25BTC accounts, at an estimated 40% of all BTC in circulation....<br /><br />Plus, on blockchain, I can see my coin being sent to my SR wallet and then transfered to two other accounts, then to another 20+ addresses in various amounts. I figured this was the tumbling. But no initial deposit has shown up on SR....I guess maybe they don&#039;t post it until it&#039;s been tumbled. NEVER had it take more than 4 hours before this :/

				It could either be that it doesn&#039;t show up until it is tumbled, or it could be that it&#039;s stuck in SR somewhere where all they will have to do is push it through.

				I&#039;m missing something.&nbsp; 50 BTC is the old reward for solving a block -- it seems perfectly reasonable to me that there would be a ton of addresses with 50 coins just sitting there.&nbsp; People who got lucky and never did anything with those coins.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t understand where you&#039;re seeing all these accounts, either...?&nbsp; Blockchain.info?&nbsp; I mean have you manually checked 2000 addresses or something?<br />

				Yeah, I don&#039;t think this is anything, but maybe I&#039;m misunderstanding?
