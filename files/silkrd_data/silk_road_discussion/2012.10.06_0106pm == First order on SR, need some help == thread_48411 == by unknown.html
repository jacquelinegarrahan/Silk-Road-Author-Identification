				Hi all<br /><br />I&#039;m new here and I&#039;m about to make an order.<br /><br />When I click on &quot;Add to cart&quot;, they ask me to put my name and address. But I think I should use GPG and encrypt my address so what do I have to do exactly ? I basically know how to encrypt a message with GPG but the message is a .asc so I need to send it as attachment, right ?<br /><br />+ I need to deposit bitcoins on my account so I click on &quot;Account&quot; and they say &quot;to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address:&quot;. How does it work ? Should I just send bitcoins from my wallet to the address mentioned ? How could they know it&#039;s me who have sent the bitcoins ?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :)

				The easiest way to use pgp is to use an online encoder, such as https://www.igolder.com/pgp/encryption/. Type in your address, paste in the vendor&#039;s PGP key. Once encrypted, paste it into the order box. If you want to practice, pm yourself an encrypted message, and see if you can decrypt it- there are online pgp decryption tools. I would suggest that if you are going to use an online encryption service to take care not to put any more info in the message than necessary. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should I just send bitcoins from my wallet to the address mentioned ?

Some people prefer to send them through a tumbler as an extra measure of precaution. SR also tumbles the coins. For the second part of your question, SR has no idea who put the bit coins in your wallet. When you make an order, your account gets checked to see if there are enough coins in it. If there is, you get to make an order. If not, you don&#039;t. <br /><br />There are about a bazillion threads on here to help you out. Check out the sticky topics in each section of the forums.

				If you&#039;re &quot;about to make an order&quot; and you&#039;re just know trying to figure out PGP and bitcoins, I think you need to slow down.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of resources for the whole process on the forums.&nbsp; Take a couple more days to read up on this, it will be for your own good.&nbsp;

				SR runs at a different pace. Depending on how you go about things, it might take a day or two to get your bitcoins, 10 minutes to make an order, and up to 2 weeks for delivery. It will get there when it gets there.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Several weeks that I&#039;m here, a bit tired to wait I must say.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I can understand that. Think of it this way. What is a couple of extra days to figure out how to do things right? Especially when you weigh it against the potential repercussions from not knowing what to do. Take the time and ask questions.<br /><br />
