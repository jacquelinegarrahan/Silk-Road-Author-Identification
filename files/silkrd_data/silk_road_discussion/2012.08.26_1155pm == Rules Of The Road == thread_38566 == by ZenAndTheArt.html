			<dd class="postbody">
				|---------------| RULES OF THE ROAD |---------------|<br /><br />1 - Escrow is there for your protection, you give up your right to any resolution when you go out of escrow or finalize early,<br />2 - As a user of Silk Road it&#039;s your responsibility to maintain the highest standards of security. This includes (but isn&#039;t limited to) learning to use PGP and TOR, and how to buy Bitcoins anonymously.<br />3 - As a user of Silk Road you take responsibility for your actions and there consequences. This includes (but isn&#039;t limited to) researching vendors, drug safety, legal and financial issues.<br />4 - As a vendor on Silk Road you must adhere to the guidelines set out in the sellers guide.<br />5 - As a buyer on Silk Road you must fulfill your part in the buying process to the best of your ability. This includes (but isn&#039;t limited to) giving an accurate address, finalizing promptly and leaving feedback that&#039;s accurate and informative.<br />6 - Absolutely no scamming of any kind is tolerable. Any one who thinks they have been scammed should report this to try and prevent any further scamming from happening.<br />7 - To help the community along, once you feel confident in the practices used on Silk Road, you should pass that knowledge on and help out newer members of the site.<br />8 - Silk Road does not allow the sale or promotion, of any items or activities, that maybe harmful to others.<br />9 - If a Silk Road user should ever get arrested for any activities related to Silk Road, they should exercise their right to remain silent and consult with a lawyer at the first possible opportunity.<br />10 - Have fun. ;D<br /><br />^This is what we&#039;ve come up with so far (please feel free to make more suggestions)^<br /><br />(ORIGINAL POST)<br />Do you remember in the film Fight Club they had those ten rules of Fight Club?<br />&quot;First rule of Fight club is, don&#039;t talk about Fight Club.<br />Second rule of Fight club is... DON&#039;T TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!&quot; <br />Etc yadda, yadda...<br /><br />If we were to have some &#039;Rules of the Road&#039;, more like guidelines for new users, what do you think would be some good rules to include?<br />One of my golden rules is to not spend more money on an item than I can afford to lose. I think many people here would also say the &#039;No FE ever&#039; rule should be the first &#039;Rule of the Road&#039;. What about vendors? Are there any golden rules of thumb to being a good vendor?

				the tenth rule was just to stay in keeping with the fight club essence. I guess it could be something like<br /><br />the tenth and final rule of Silk Road is if your sending important information it has to be encrypted. <br /><br />that just sounds less fight club-ish to me.<br /><br />updated rule post to reflect this change

				I&#039;d love to see some official version of these rules adopted! Then whenever someone posts something like &quot;I got scammed by this vendor because of X,Y or Z&quot; you could point to the Rule of the Road and say &quot;Sorry bud, but you broke rule 1,2 and 4! The rules were set out for this reason, a long time ago, for your protection!&quot; :)
