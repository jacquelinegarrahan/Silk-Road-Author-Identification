				Some vendors have it in their profile their SR &#039;shop hours&#039; to give the buyer an idea of when they&#039;ll reply to questions and when they process orders. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen vendors who work Tues, Wed, Thurs and that&#039;s it. <br /><br />From a buyers perspective I can see how this might increase the potential for mistakes. <br /><br />There becomes a backlog of messages to answer and orders to process. Orders and messages will be missed and even quantities may not be accurate. <br /><br />This is only a buyer making assumptions and they could be wrong but its something I&#039;ve encountered lately.

				Some nice points. Alot of those vendors have their operation down packed though, we personally work all day everyday but I can see how that would be a burden on many of the large vendors and could probably become a little overwhelming.

				The other reason I&#039;m asking is because I&#039;m currently having a communication issue with a vendor. <br /><br />They are slow to reply because they are only online for three days and must be back logged with other emails. <br /><br />And they aren&#039;t giving me the information they said they would. Namely a damn tracking number. Without this I have no idea if they&#039;ve shipped my stuff. This is a reship by the way so there is nothing on the transaction history to say when they sent it out.

				I think a few hours every day is the way I&#039;m going to handle it when I open up a store.&nbsp; But I only plan to ship one day a week, on Saturday mornings.&nbsp; It&#039;s important to have time off from here though.&nbsp; You can stare at the screen all day.&nbsp; Shit, there&#039;s lots of good weed to smoke on their end as well.

				I don&#039;t mind when vendors take some time off. It means they may have a life. As awesome as SR is, it shouldn&#039;t be one&#039;s everything. Communication, frequent shipping, etc. are very important though so I think there&#039;s just a good balance that needs to be found, as with all things in life.

				To me, as long as the vendor lets me know what his work hours are - its all good.&nbsp; Communication is the key to success<br /><br /><br /><br />
