				i know its a great service on here and everything but the prices are a bit steep arent they? for coke and weed in particular. I just wondered if the price is normal where you are from and if the quality is reflected in the price?<br /><br />

				Weed (high-end KB) ends up being about $10 cheaper than I pay in real life. Don&#039;t know about coke for sure, but from what I&#039;ve heard its a little bit pricier than real life.

				20/g 60/8th is pretty standard for everything I&#039;ve ever seen, then again I never lived in a pot friendly state.&nbsp; If the weed is more expensive on SR then why are you bothering on here?&nbsp; Hit up your local dealer and save yourself the 5% fees for bitcoins.<br /><br />Perfect example:&nbsp; I had to buy from my local dealer last week because I couldn&#039;t get BTC in time.&nbsp; What I got came in UNDERweight, really small nugs (biggest one was the size of my thumb), not very many crystals and had got me decently high.&nbsp; Everything I have gotten from here weed-wise blows local shit out of the water.&nbsp; Taste, THC content, crystals, everything.&nbsp; Hell, I save 10-20$ an 8th buying from here.

				I know street weight is always under, and from what Ive read on here what people receive is always at least the right weight, if not over. So the selling point is the quality? Does anyone know if its the same for coke?

				Yeah man SR coke is mostly off the brick. On the street it gets cut and stepped on by almost everyone that touches it. Average street coke is around 40% where is SR coke is normally double that. (I can get street cut coke for 50 a gram sooo even if SR coke is double the quality, it is still double the price..)<br /><br />The weed prices are the same as I see locally, 20-gram 50/60 - eight. BUT I have found good bulk vendors that sell 2 ounces around $500 making the final price around 10 bucks a gram. <br /><br />I had personally hoped that with so many vendors that SR would have more &quot;competitive&quot; prices. One day I hope to get a buyers account and undercut the whole damn place :D

				A lot of the weed and coke on here seems a bit steep to me as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to offer prices that are a bit closer to the street prices I&#039;ve seen. (~45-50/ 8th).&nbsp; The E prices on here are pretty phenomenal though, a lot better than most anything that I&#039;ve come across.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				The most premium of strains for the bud enthusiast are pretty expensive but there are plenty of heady and reliable strains. Tried and true strains but the the new and the super experimental are more expensive. <br /><br />Check out nugz for his 420 sale on Sour Diesel, 8g (normally 7g) for $70 is almost half price around these parts.

				skunks too expensive for me here - IRL i can get full 3.5g henrys for Â£20, or an oz for Â£140. it&#039;s just take-what-i&#039;ve-got though, there&#039;s no selection. Hash is around Â£350 for a bar which means i don&#039;t bother with it and stick to the skunk. <br /><br />coke here is priced about the same as i can get IRL (most likely due to the GBP&gt;USD exchange rate :) ) but the quality is SOOOO much better.<br /><br />for coke go for MoveItNice for perfectly decent coke at very reasonable prices, or Tetravort for the washed stuff, which is expensive but in my book is worth every penny.

				Yes, some prices are high, but if you take into account the fact that when you buy on the street you can be driving your car and using gas. In my opinion for some products, the commodity of having it delivered to your door the extra price is well worth paying.

Same goes for the person on p1 of this thread who gets a bar (=9oz/250gr) for Â£350.<br /><br />Those prices are soap bar prices, and soap bar is (at best) leftover plant matter after sifting for kif, powdered and held together with some sort of resin, coloured with something brown. At worst you don&#039;t want to think about what *could* be in it.<br /><br />If however you really are getting 250g of good hash for Â£350, or a half ounce of good hash for Â£35, then you are extremely well connected and you shouldn&#039;t really be offering that as a genuine comparative price in a thread like this. It is not representative of what any average UK buyer would pay on the street.<br /><br />As an aside, a really great hash like a top Indian hand rubbed charas is produced at no more than a rate of 6 or 7 grams per day per person. You think you&#039;re going to get that halfway round the world for anything less than Â£10 per gram you&#039;re mistaken, and frankly, it&#039;s likely to be a fair bit more than that.<br /><br />Good hash is expensive. Because it is a premium product.

				Actually they are a little steep... I wont buy any weed, or THC product on SR. In CAN in a rural community i am paying about 150.00 an oz. for some kickass herb. I make my own oil 2 tokes knock you on your ass with the bottom dredges of 4 bags. <br /><br />Pharmaceuticals are double...i see percs on SR going for 7+ dollars each. Will pass on them as well, and grab them locally for 3.50 a pop for 10/325&#039;s, and also see 80mg oxy&#039;s for 35 for the IR greenskins in town every once in awhile. So i also pass on these purchases online.<br /><br />Special K is unavailable in our area so kinda cool to see it on SR, and H is also not frequent or of substantial quality so nice to get a real opiate to bump regardless of prices.<br /><br />Cocaine is available, but quality in town sucks compared to what is to be found on SR, but you pay 20.00 more a gram on SR so purchase would maybe be a possibility unless i see a worthy sale.<br /><br />Yeah prices are steep so i pass up alot that is available, and stick to the one or two things that are not available to me where i live. I found personal home connections to save me more, but like to use SR as a new member for the exotic things i can find here and there.<br /><br />Just my .02 bit coins as a consumer ;)<br /><br /><br />

				i don&#039;t think, that the prices are &quot;overpriced&quot;... - e.g. when you buy stuff on the streets (i&#039;m from central europe) you pay 10 eur/ pill, 25 eur/ speed, 50eur/mdma, 80 eur/coke - so the prices here on sr are pretty cheap, especially in bulk where you just pay 4-5 eur/ pill! you could possibly double it, when re-selling it on the streets here...

Same goes for the person on p1 of this thread who gets a bar (=9oz/250gr) for Â£350.<br /><br />Those prices are soap bar prices, and soap bar is (at best) leftover plant matter after sifting for kif, powdered and held together with some sort of resin, coloured with something brown. At worst you don&#039;t want to think about what *could* be in it.<br /><br />If however you really are getting 250g of good hash for Â£350, or a half ounce of good hash for Â£35, then you are extremely well connected and you shouldn&#039;t really be offering that as a genuine comparative price in a thread like this. It is not representative of what any average UK buyer would pay on the street.<br /><br />As an aside, a really great hash like a top Indian hand rubbed charas is produced at no more than a rate of 6 or 7 grams per day per person. You think you&#039;re going to get that halfway round the world for anything less than Â£10 per gram you&#039;re mistaken, and frankly, it&#039;s likely to be a fair bit more than that.<br /><br />Good hash is expensive. Because it is a premium product.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />soapbar isn&#039;t made with old lorry tyres and death as you might think from the smell when you burn it - its a traditional Liverpudlian recipe and its mostly bulked out with condensed milk power and leaves

				Where Im from its <br />Weed Â£10/g&nbsp; &nbsp; the weed is powerfull<br /><br />Cocaine Â£20 for a bag or 3 for Â£50.......and i would say cocaine content is &lt;5%<br /><br />LSD Â£5<br /><br />Pills Â£10 for a good one.<br /><br />So for me its good for cocaine and pills and heroin cause you dont have to see a dealer for that!<br /><br />I used to live in America so In know you can get quality cocaine for $20.<br />I do think the mephedrone is quite expensive for a gram!

				The pharms are what seem overpriced on SR to me, adderall for example is selling for $15 for 30g IR on SR, I sell them for $5. Oxys, painkillers, it&#039;s all overpriced but more selection available.<br /><br />Ecstacy prices are good on SR, but I haven&#039;t gotten any yet for fear of shipping through customs but it&#039;s tempting since most E in my area is shit and 75% of MDMA here isn&#039;t real MDMA.<br /><br />The weed prices on SR are high by the 1/8th (those selling $75 / eighth, I couldn&#039;t convince anyone to buy an 8th for $75 no matter how good it is), but there are some good deals for oz for $300, which is better quality than I can get for $350 in my area.<br /><br />Coke and H prices are really high on SR, but the quality is a lot higher too. I can get coke for $80-$120 / g here but you get what you pay for. Meth prices are outrageous but that might just be because it&#039;s dirt cheap in my area.

				I have yet to try the cocaine and heroin available on Silk Road but I have tried a lot of local Floridian cocaine...<br /><br />I can assure you that it was of high quality with no levimasole. One batch was reported to be from Chile and was hands down the strongest and most euphoric cocaine I have ever done.<br /><br />As for the amount of cut I can&#039;t say mostly because I have never done any laboratory type testing on any of the products that I purchased. I&#039;m looking to locally redistribute any products I receive from these forums so I trust that whatever purchase I make will be good enough to adulterate and redistribute amongst my local network.<br /><br />:)

				weed on SR seems ridiculously overpriced, I get weed for $10/gram locally. Q for $60, O for $200, QP for $750. and I&#039;m talking kush. Is the weed on SR actually that much better than what I can get locally? I don&#039;t know.

				My approach was to deliver product for significantly (30%+) lower prices than currently available (now hash, but soon xtc and speed too) and i am still setting up my supply lines and seeing if it&#039;s all possible, but i have good hope.
