				if DPR got found and caught.. what would he be charged with?<br /><br />assuming he does not use drugs, he has no drugs in his possession/property, he does not sell drugs.. the only thing he is doing is keeping and maintaining his silk road site open.. <br /><br />what would the authorities charge him with? it&#039;s not a crime to have a website right? i mean the things that other people do on his website he can&#039;t be responsible for... <br /><br />i hope that never happens, but i&#039;m wondering what he would be &quot;in trouble&quot; for...

Wouldn&#039;t surprise me if the charge of tax evasion was as at the top of our hypothetical list b/c it will be the easiest charge to prove and make it stick.&nbsp; Obviously this assumes DPR is not paying taxes.&nbsp; For all we know, DPR is paying taxes by channeling SR profits into some legit biz.&nbsp; JMO.&nbsp; Peace.

				I doubt he would be caught, and if he was, it would not be that big of charges.<br /><br />For exemple WikiLeaks owner was not charge for his website but for fake accusations nothing related to his website. <br /><br />Not because you own a website that you can be charged for everything happening on it. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure he is doing his business in one of those country where the government doesn&#039;t have law that could arrest him.

				I don&#039;t think you can really compare SR and Wikileaks when it comes to breaking the law.<br /><br />Publishing information on a website is certainly different than directly profiting from the sale of contraband.<br /><br />I am not quite sure what the US could charge him with if he isn&#039;t a US citizen or based in the US..&nbsp; Certainly not tax evasion.&nbsp; But I am sure there are many charges along the lines of facilitating illegal drug trade they could try to pin on him.<br /><br />I do agree the borders don&#039;t seem to matter that much anymore if the US were to actually figure out where he was operating from.&nbsp; Just look at MegaUpload.

				I feel its unfair to compare DPR, Cthulu bless him, to Wikileaks.<br /><br />DPR is the founder of a black market, there&#039;s a billion and one other ones, even some within the TOR network.<br /><br />The US military was repeatedly proven to have done terrible things because of wikileaks, shaking the resolve of even hardened nationalists. They felt attacked, so they&#039;ve since made Julian Assange&#039;s life a complete hell and continue to do so.

				I wasn&#039;t comparing DPR to Wikileaks.&nbsp; Was just giving an example of some people the US are after and Julian Assange is one - as DPR would be if they knew who he was.<br /><br />Obviously the level of effort may be different - but the US seems to apply serious pressure to get anyone including the others I mentioned in the thread and I could give many more examples as well.&nbsp; When spending money and effort on shit like this they always forget that they are 16+ trillion in debt.<br /><br />Hopefully it never reaches the point that they know who DPR is because the country he resides in would probably already be after him.&nbsp; But if they werent I am sure the US would pressure them to be in quick order.

				Does anyone think there would be any benefit for LE to try and flip DPR if they were somehow able to capture him privately?&nbsp; Not trying to insinuate that DPR is the type of person that would be able to be flipped but let&#039;s just assume for one second it were possible to gain access to the management portion of SR either with DPR&#039;s forced cooperation or simple physical access to the servers with skilled enough technicians to break in.<br /><br />The main things they could get from having access to SR at an admin level would be BTC addresses and full tracking of the stuff happening in the mixer, DCNs given for resolutions, and addresses and other private information that people fail to encrypt while using the PM and ordering systems.<br /><br />Does anyone think this would be enough for LE to try and maintain the site and gather more information to try and locate vendors or would they just immediately shut it down and claim victory?<br /><br />Thoughts?

				One word- Conspiracy.<br /><br />People have been charged with trafficking drugs who never touched saw or had anything but a minimal stake in it, like letting someone use your car and he gets caught. DPR is a smart guy, he is an innovator, I&#039;m pretty sure he knows the risks and he more than likely knows he would be doing life if caught. Just think how much of one drug has been sold on SR since its start. Can you say Conspiracy to traffic 1,000,000 lbs of ecstasy. DPR created this site, it essentially enables people to traffic drugs all over the world. <br />On the flip side like we see with innovators even in the black market where most are facing insane amounts of charges, there is usually a plea bargain to drop certain charges and maybe even a job to help the gov lol.
