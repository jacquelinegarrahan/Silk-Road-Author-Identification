				Hey guys,<br /><br />I thought about being the middle-man between Silk Road and people who do not have the technical knowledge, time and reason to use SR themselves.

				Generally speaking, I&#039;d say prices on SR are to high to make any real profit. I too have thought about doing this myself (i do buy an oz of weed, sell gram bags and smoke the rest for free). <br /><br />Are you planning on buying the product with your own money and sell it to them when it arrives/have the vendor delivery to their address? Or will you be taking the money first? Think about this for a moment... which ever way you decide to do it... what if it doesn&#039;t arrive? Or what if you have the vendor send it directly to them and they say it didn&#039;t arrive etc. For me, its just way too much hassle.<br /><br />I&#039;d say buy in bulk and shift it to make a profit. There&#039;s no point in trying to make a little profit off a single order every now and then.<br /><br />My friends ask me to to buy stuff for them and give me money but i wont do it. I insist on teaching them to use tails, pgp, bitcoins etc etc and do it themselves.<br /><br />Hope that helps

What do you think would happen if one of my customers get busted and tells the cops he talked to me and a week later he had a nice package in his mailbox?

				If you live in the USA, sell molly. That&#039;s all you need. If you buy bulk from euro vendors, the profit margins are ridiculous. Here in the states a gram of molly is generally 100-150. If you buy a 10g sack from one of the NL or german sellers, you pay around 30-40 a gram. That&#039;s like 200-300% profit right there.

I don&#039;t think I had much to do with it, but after a year on here, I am starting to find pricing that I can live with, without a doubt.

At a bare MINIMUM, you can triple your money without even trying or having a clue what to do.<br /><br />Trust me. 8)

				Dealing IRL is far more dangerous than dealing on SR but if that&#039;s a game you want to play, more power to you. <br /><br />I would say that if you are dealing with close friends and friends of friends, i.e. no strangers; and you&#039;re dealing in small amounts, you can probably do it for years and get away with it.<br /><br />A lot of people are recommending Molly, which again, if it&#039;s small amounts and close friends, by all means go for it. But make sure you know who you are dealing with because if it gets in the hands of some dumb 16 year old girl who overdoses, you better believe the police will turn up every rock trying to find the source. <br /><br />Taking custom orders via strain for cannabis is a major pain in the ass unless you are getting money up front. In my experience, there are three types of cannabis smokers:<br />1) People who don&#039;t know very much about weed and will smoke whatever as long as it gets them high<br />2) People who have slight preferences (indica/sativa) but other than that, are pretty happy with whatever <br />3) People who have very specific tastes and seek out bud like winos seek out certain wines<br /><br />Catering to people&#039;s individual needs is only beneficial if your customers are type 3. Types 1 and 2 will smoke whatever you give them as long as it isn&#039;t garbage.<br /><br />The money isn&#039;t in eighths if you are buying them as eighths off of SR. I can&#039;t even imagine how you would make money doing that, eighths are $40-$60 on SR, what do they go for in your town? Instead, buy an ounce from a reputable vendor ($200-$300), break it up into eighths, sell them for $50 each, and bam you just doubled your money. <br /><br />Good luck!
