				All the meds, even hydrocodone is expensive as hell. Take this generic 20mg IR adderall, the guy is wanting 4.48 bitcoins and that is $19.26 USD for ONE pill. i never paid over $10 per pill for adderall locally, i know one thing i&#039;m in the wrong line of work if you&#039;re getting 20 per pill for an 8hr blast.

				The prices may seem expensive in your area, but in a lot of areas, those are normal prices.<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in different locations and the price variance is extreme.<br /><br />But the simple answer is -- the price is high because people will pay it.&nbsp; ;D<br />

				Supply and demand. There is a lot of demand for pills so prices are high. If you can get it cheaper at home, do it.

				I asked that too, when I first joined up. It has a lot to do with all the products it takes to safely ship an item. Vacuum sealers, tons and tons of vacuum bags. Alcohol, gloves, total cost of shipping. Most use priority, so it&#039;s 6.10usd at the minimum, with DCN. <br />SR is not for those who live in an area of easy accessibility. Imagine having to brave jungles full of militia and gov&#039;t military, then gangs, to get some drugs. Imagine going through sum slum in South America, South Africa, or even the Middle East. At that point, what would you pay for a buzz?

				- reduce smaller purchases instead of sub 1g or 1-2g&#039;s of a subs ....1-5g&#039;s could just as easily be delivered.<br /><br />- guarantee a courier delivery method.<br /><br />

				makes a lot of sense now.. but when you&#039;re dirt poor right now, it&#039;s still TOO high for me. The only reason i came here is because of a friend from a forum recommend this place because i was looking for hydrocodone 7.5 - 10mg for my 71yo granny with Osteomyelitis and crippling arthritis. She&#039;s always in pain and her doctor took her off of the hydrocodone for a month to keep her from getting addicted to them.. This made me so furious that i called up her doctor myself and told him what i thought.. <br /><br />She&#039;s 71 and doesn&#039;t have much more time left on this earth and to let her live out the rest of her days in pain, even if it&#039;s just for a month really ticks me off. If i was a doctor, knowing that my patient has had Osteomyelitis with arthritis half of her life, she&#039;s taken every OTC med know to man, but she has taken so much of these OTC meds that they have no effect what so ever. i believe i would give her the pain meds when she asked for them if i was a doctor.<br /><br />Of course when i got here and saw everything that was for sale my mouth started watering badly, but my first priority was to get my granny some pain meds and the only hydrocodone i see is a guy selling 100 for a crap load of money and i think the oxy will be too stong for her. So if anyone knows any place where i can get her these pain meds, PLEASE let me know.

				Keep in mind that if a package is lost or claimed to not have been received, it is likely to come out of the vendor&#039;s pocket. I assume most of the prices accommodate for lost shipments and deadbeat buyers.

				I feel like I should make a suggestion in regards to the adderall, as sketchy as this is, make friends/causal acquaintances with high schoolers. Back when I really needed to get shit done I would pick up a bag of 50 20mg IR for $100, that&#039;s right, two bucks a pill, those kids had no idea what it was worth.

				If shes been on hydrocodone, and you can find oxycodone for cheaper, then I would totally suggest that. Orally, they are not really that different, many even prefer hydro over oxy. The conversion is about 1.5 to 2x, so that may save you some money as well.<br /><br />Pretty much, 7.5 mg of the hydrocodone equals 5 mg of oxy.<br />Just get your granny some good dope&nbsp; ;D diamorphine is an excellent analgesic, and is used in the UK for terminal patients. Its way cheaper than the pills. <br /><br />Just make sure they dont drug test her at each apt before the next script. <br /><br />Good luck treating your pain! <br />- miRNA
