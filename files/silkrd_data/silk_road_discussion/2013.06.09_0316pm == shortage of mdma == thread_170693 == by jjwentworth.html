				is it me or does it seem like theres a real shortage of cheap reliable OG mdma vendors on the road? i think all the newbies using SR has sucked up all the excess mdma in the world and now theres a shortage. anybody know when dutchtrade will be putting his listings back up? him and mister m1 are the last two vendors i feel comfortable using with great prices and now they both have no listings up.

				if im not mistaken symbiosis shipping price is just absurd. jesus of rave i heard bailed to atlantis when sr went down which shows no loyalty to sr therefore i refuse to buy from him and i have been looking at subtickle also but theres just something holding me back with him. idk maybe im just missing the days when i first found sr almost 2 yrs ago and there were like 85 listings for mdma and every vendor was reliable and were able to build a relationship with them. nowadays theres over 1100 listings like 300 vendors a hell of alot more scammers and and when all of your reg vendors [ull down there listings like dutchtrade mister m1 kwikemart or go MIA like juergen did it becomes a lil concerning having to go do all tghe research to sift thru all the new bullshit vendors out there. almost wish DPR would close the registration for new vendors but i know that will never happen. just ranting over here im having withdrawl of getting deliveries and want to order something just not sure who to go with. i swear getting deliveries and checking the mailbos has become a whole new addiction for me.<br /><br />@fartbomber sorryh yes im in the states. ive seen your listings but just dont order from the netherlands.

				i disagree with that. SR has made a lot of people wealthy and who they are today. to sign up with a competitor which atlantis is shows no loyalty. if you worked for coke your whole life bought you&nbsp; your house allowed you to raise your family on a competitive salary and coke went on strike would you go across the street to pepsi until coke went back to work?

				I don&#039;t understand the analogy. The coke employees are on strike? So the people you used to work with are refusing to work for some reason or another, probably getting underpaid or overworked or something like that. I&#039;d almost definitely go buy some Pepsi if the corporate folks up the food chain at Coke were fucking over my friends.<br /><br />But it has nothing to do with the situation here, I love SR and DPR isn&#039;t fucking over any of my friends. If SR goes down for good will you never use another marketplace? Will you go down with your ship out of loyalty and go back to street drugs? Some people may but I feel like the majority would move on. <br />Personally I only use SR at the moment but I have accounts on BMR and Atlantis, if they become the better sites with better vendors I will not hesitate to switch. I thought the idea was a free market? Free markets breed competition and DPR knows this.

				yea and in&nbsp; a free market place im allowed to choose who i buy from as you are to. i feel he has no loyalty therefore i dont buy from him. feel free to continue doing buisness with him if you choose to do so. and as far as ever switching market places sr would have to seriously go down hill or go down for good before i were to switch. the loyalty and dedication DPR has shown to all of us has earned his loyalty from me. Not to mention atlantis was rumoured to possibly be behind the attacks which makes him sign up as a vendor over there even worse. just my two cents!

				The MDMA scene has never been better here imho. Huge selection, prices are lower than ever and seem to be costantly lowering. The quality itself seems to improving (this could be subjective but I doubt it). Even the MDMA itself seems to be getting cleaner in general.<br /><br />If only the MDA market would blossom a bit. :/
