				Hi,<br />I did a search but didnt find any guides or articles so forgive me if they exist, i am sure they will.<br /><br />So i have been selling erm... &quot;pork sausages&quot;... for a few years now, mostly in bulk to customers who became friends with another good income from a job this has suited me well.<br />To save up some pennies i have thought about selling in smalls due to the higher profit.<br />I live in the UK and wish to start selling on silk road.<br /><br />I have a few questions:<br />How hard is it to start off? <br />How likely are scammers to target starting sellers due to inexperience?<br />Any big &quot;busts&quot;(legal) within the UK from SR?<br />Posting? how? proof? return address?<br /><br />I am confident i can operate securely, I have a very close friend who owns several sucessful internet enterprises one specializing in white hat hacking and he is confident we can remain as undetected as possible.<br />thankfully he is tor literate and understands most of this stuff as well as bitcoins. (He showed me SR many months ago - possibly year+ it just clicked the other night i should use this!)<br /><br />So i am practically doing a joint venture, myself the main person behind the show and a close friend running financials and security (and mostly the brain).<br /><br />apparently we will operate on a swedish server and our data will go out though an african VPN or something like that<br />is this safe? he seems confident and was talking about encryption of some sort<br />can we really be undetected? i am using some virtual computer he set up at the moment? i thought everything on the internet was detectable?<br /><br />If this is seen as a fishing attempt please just delete the post and somebody PM me? :)

				Have to agree with shannon, but i suspect the issue lies in your translation of what your friend has said.<br /><br />Anyway read the security forum that will tell you all you need to know.<br /><br />

				I assumed he confused it with a swedish VPN, the piratebay guys provide one that maintains minimal logs and records and has the same ethos as the piratebay when it comes to sharing data with govt./LE.<br /><br />Of course that implies he is using an African server, that continent not being renowned for its bandwidth or IT infrastructure, means you may also be correct ;)

				hi thanks for reply<br />not sure what my friend means by most of it you are correct vpn is something i have heard at work so was able to remember it (cant tell you what it stands for though!)<br />im not sure what you mean by full of it? i am 100% confident in him, in an IT management position (by looking at his cars it pays well too) for a high profile firm. I also know he has a history with fraud and the internet. (not a criminal history, just brought up in conversation a few times although i dont understand any of it - clever bugger though)<br />i will point him to this topic and also the security forum. i kno he has purchased off SR before as he introduced me to it.<br /><br />(and to access it i have to use some vnc thing to his server somewere as i dont understand how to set it up on my pc plus apparently its best if its not on my pc and offshore?)<br /><br />i will look at the tradecraft guides thank u for help so far very much appreciated<br />i am not much of a forum user as you may tell i just want to get afew products sold a day. not looking for a career out of it. just want to save up for kids future if im completely honest...<br /><br />my main concern is the postal service

				Ok, well given your level of expertise i would advise you dont rush into things, read the forums, familiarise yourself with how things work, join Pine&#039;s GPG club, perhaps make sn order yourself to see how it works from the buyer side.<br /><br />Dont just dive in and hope for the best, you will end up with a bad rep and the potential to compromise operational security, putting you and your buyers at risk.
