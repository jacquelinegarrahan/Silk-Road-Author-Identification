				Hello everybody I&#039;m looking to make some money on SR and on the tor network in general but have nothing to sell and no connects in real life... I would like to know if you guys think its possible to resell drugs on SR that you buy off SR? (For example i buy some from somebody with good prices on SR and then resell them) <br /><br />Do you guys think its possible or do you think prices are too much to be able to make a profit? Is anybody doing the same?

				hahahaha yep depending on where you live, the prices here should be much cheaper than the street price, not to mention quality being top notch too. Make sure you do your research if you wanna get your name out there and all the best buddy

				This is entirely possible if you resell mdma from say Old Amsterdam, or other reputable overseas vendors and sell it domestically in the U.S for a 50-100% mark up. Right now i know some of OA&#039;s listings average out to under $30 a gram for his crystalline MDMA and if you were to sell his product, uncut on SR for $50-$60 a gram to USA buyers you would own the market, sell out fast, and stack your money just as quick. I almost did this back in the days of Pfandleiher&#039;s MDMA. As long as you dont get too greedy and stick to $60 a gram or under you will be quite popular.

				yeah I have noticed quite a few people re sell stuff, a lot of people buying in bulk from holland and then selling in smaller amounts, few prople doing it with bars of hash, people will buy it as it saves them the hassle of worrying about customs.

				I will even point you in the right direction.<br /><br />Your big money makers will most likely be MDMA and rolls/mints/MDMA pills whatever you want to call them.<br /><br />The markup on this stuff can be anywhere from 100-300% depending on your country.&nbsp;

				yeah problem with bulk on SR is that your LE call it, &quot;importation of a commercial quantity of an illegal substance with intent to distribute&quot; or package has to circumvent the border protection.<br /><br />if it does however, you will have a supply problem and quality control problem.<br />irl u can say, oh that looks shit and walk away or take it back and say, hey mother fucker, what you give me, refund or replace (bring some heavy&#039;s)<br /><br />you get what you get, and when you run out, you will loose all the customers because u failed to supply.<br /><br />then you get more, larger qtys more risk, eventually ending you up in jail.<br />so you have to balance the economy scales i suppose.<br />for example:<br />its like what is the jail time for 1kilo =&nbsp; say 10 years. so i need to make at least 500k off this kilo = 50k a year for time spent in jail<br />otherwise if you are only gonna make 50k from the 1 kilo and you may or may not get 10 years jail.... 5k a year... seriously not worth the time. go work at macdonalds... that way you get to watch your kids grow up too.<br /><br />Besides, when you do go to jail, you may want some RL contacts, coz when a drug dealer goes to jail... they are still expected to keep supplying to your new friends in jail for not beating the shit out of you. If you don&#039;t supply them in there they might just think you are being greedy and kick your ass for the fun of it. Or if they find out you were supplying in their area, errr... yeah.. gg. someones gonna be an example here to others. <br /><br />So.. my advice, have some RL friends in this industry that can look out for you if you end up in jail<br />This aint a game for novices, you need to have all your bases covered. <br /><br />I just wanted to add a few things you probably didnt think of.<br /><br />good luck anyway

				Are you in UK. If so then get a crop on the go. Grow some Ganja.<br /><br />Everybody loves cannabis. People from all walks of life smoke, eat and vape the herb.<br /><br />The love is so great that demand often outstrips supply for something that is so good and relatively harmless.<br /><br />Nobody will OD on your shit. They will just be made happy.<br />Even if you sold at the street price you would be in profit.<br /><br />You could sell at more than street price here on SR. Sell primo quality for £250 -£300 per oz including stealth packaging.<br />Sell reasonably good quality for £190 - £210 /oz<br /><br />Sell full eights for £30 to £35 inc p+p.<br />Sell 7g quarters for £55-£60 inc p+p.<br />This would sell like hot cakes on the road.<br /><br />You will make a killing once you have a few grows under your belt&nbsp; and can provide quality buds. Find a good strain and clone it.
