				Just because bitinstant asks for your information doesn&#039;t mean you have to give it to them, you can use fake information. The only real problem is the $500 limit. If you try making more then one payment in a day they will flag your name, so, if you do need a large amount of money make sure to use different names for each transaction or use a different $ amount that also will stop it from flagging you.

				Bitinstant and CVS (zipzap) worked fine for me. If they ask for ID, say your wallet was stolen and that&#039;s why you&#039;re using such a bill pay service. As everyone has already stated, you can use whatever name and info you like. Just make sure you have it memorized!

				Bitinstant is still completely reliable in my experience. I was sketched by the idea of having to provide fake info, but now it&#039;s second nature- I&#039;m even beginning to like my pseudonym. ;) <br /><br />Just be ready for them to spell your last name back to you really fast so you don&#039;t respond with, &quot;Huh? Oh... Um, yeah, that&#039;s it.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, CVS occasionally asks for ID while Walmart never does.<br /><br />If your funds don&#039;t show up for a few hours just call or email Bitinstant and give them the transaction number or whatever they gave you on the printout and ask what&#039;s going on. I highly doubt these guys are selectively scamming users out of a few hundred bucks at a time. Your transaction&#039;s in their records and they&#039;re gonna have to show you that the coins went SOMEWHERE...

				I think CaptainMal had got to be my favorite BTC vendor. I&#039;ve done done several high amount transactions with him. Always on point and he gets BTC to your account fast, with blockchain info as well.<br /><br />Vendor page - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/aea18a79c0<br /><br />He also has a review thread here on the forum which you can find by using the search bar,

				Thanks for the suggestions. I think I gotta go with CaptainMal, especially since she gave me my first 0.01 BTC to test if my client was working before I made my first Bitinstant deposit a couple months ago. :) I&#039;ll report back in the appropriate thread(s) once I do...

				As far as anonymity is concerned, I would place Walmart as more anonymous than a brick-and-morter bank.&nbsp; Banks are all about security, more so than any Walmart I&#039;ve ever &quot;shopped&quot; at.&nbsp; I&#039;ll stick with Walmart for the time being.<br /><br />For my smalltime purchasing here on SR, the $500 limit hasn&#039;t bugged me one bit yet.&nbsp; The most I ever had to deposit was $5000, and I basically just did it across a few days with different names and different WalMarts and it was fine.&nbsp; For $5000, I don&#039;t mind having to do a little more work to turn it to BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also it&#039;s extremely fast.&nbsp; Like the clerk types in my fake info, hits submit.&nbsp; The register says authorizing or something along those lines, and before it even says completed and pops the drawer open, my phone beeps with the incoming transaction.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love that satisfaction of getting my coins immediately after I fork over the cash.<br /><br />And my last point--acquiring bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal.&nbsp; Using them for illegal things is illegal.&nbsp; So no matter how you get your coins, make sure that the coins you buy for cash aren&#039;t the same coins you use on SR.&nbsp; Tumble them and you&#039;ll be good.

				I hope this isn&#039;t off topic, but am I wrong in saying that the information given on BitInstant and MtGox is irrelevant as long as it&#039;s ran through something like BitFog before being sent to your SR Wallet where it is tumbled again?

Plus leave your regular phone home, and on, for a little plausible deniability. Maybe it&#039;s a little paranoid, but I even park out of sight of the parking lot cameras, especially at retail stores. The only thing they have is the footage from the counter, and my appearance is pretty generic. So, unless the cameras are better than I remember, the only thing I have to fear is a store security guy being curious enough to follow me to my car. And, how likely is that to happen if I don&#039;t boost anything?

				Is being a SR BTC vendor not against the rules of the SR? I&#039;m not pointing fingers or ratting anyone out, but doesn&#039;t the SR rules say you cannot use any other transaction methods than the SR escrow service? I would love to buy my coins from vendors on here, but my concern lies in the fact that there is no form of escrow (although someone may be able to correct me if I am wrong). Is there anyway to have an escrow service that will send me bitcoins once I have uploaded the payment to a bank account or something similar? The largest deposit I have ever done was near 300$ or so, and I am not a big huge buyer but I would like to not use bitinstant anymore just because of the fee&#039;s and what not.

				There&#039;s no reason anyone should be getting flagged if you want to deposit more than $500 through bitinstant. Just remember to use a different phone number, name, and destination address (whether its wallet or email) for every deposit. When you use a phone number and name to make a deposit on bitinstant those two values will be linked to each other, with the phone number being the master key. If you try to make a deposit using a phone number that you&#039;ve used previously with a different name your transaction will not go through.
