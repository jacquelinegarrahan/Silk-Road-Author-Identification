				I was thinking last night about SR and stuff and think that it would be pretty neat to see an analysis done on the number of packages sent from individual countries to the United States on a daily basis.&nbsp; Would there be any benefit to this, or is it even possible to do this as a citizen? <br /><br />Another idea I had for sellers, and some may already do this (I&#039;m a nub), is to disguise packages as an Amazon.com or similar store order, where the package is obvious where it came from. Should be easily faked with a few custom labels. Surely this has been discussed though.
