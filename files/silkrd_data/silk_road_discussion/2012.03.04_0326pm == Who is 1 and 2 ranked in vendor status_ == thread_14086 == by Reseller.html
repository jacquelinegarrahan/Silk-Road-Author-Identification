				I&#039;m a Pharmville regular. So naturally, I&#039;m happy that they are in the top billing. A well deserved spot if I might add. Though seeing Tony76 also being in the top, suggests that I might need to sample some of tony76&#039;s offerings. Read Tony76 has the best coke on the road. Good thing I bookmarked Tony76.

				lol i see alot of people speculating on vendors cash and silkroads bankroll, granted it may be very high but i guarantee it is much less than what is perceived, <br /><br />just think about what SR has to keep up, hes got the hedge system which is amazing for customers it pretty much eliminates the btc fluctuation probably a big expense of his when bitcoins go down significantly, refunds, server cost, developers, support team, <br />hes got alot of expenses and this is a huge business, but its HIS business :P <br /><br />Also for vendors they go through alot to, refunds, lost packages, cost to keep inventory up, <br /><br />They probably do have money not gonna say they dont but look at what they are doing lol it takes a toll on a person to continuously do illegal shit so money is what they get for putting themselves through hardship <br /><br />Stop being jealous and trying to figure out what they make find a idea of your own and make some money and get on their level SHIT!!!!

				Yeah, I&#039;m glad that we&#039;re getting some real competition finally from Tony 76 and Dr. Amsterdam.<br /><br />We were on here about 2 months when we went to #1 and held it until we went down for almost 2 weeks and you can be that starting with today we are going to start shipping like crazy to get back to that #1 spot.<br /><br />In fact, Tony 76, if you end up reading this, give me a pm or I will give you one, considering what each of us sells there might be some reasons to say &quot;hello&quot; to each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But I will say one thing...with all the stuff we have coming out in the next couple of months, both public and stealth, if someone else is #1 after that, then damn, that person is working so hard that they deserve it hands down and Ben and I will both bow down and take off our hats to them, guaranteed.<br /><br />Besides, it&#039;s not a competition to be #1.&nbsp; For a long time that we were #1 Juergen 2000 was #2.&nbsp; The point is that it appears that there are starting to get to be a few more highly professional, competitively priced vendors on SR and I think that&#039;s a GREAT THING whether they are beating us in sales or not.&nbsp; I&#039;d just LOVE to see 100 vendors of the quality of tony76, DrAmsterdam or us (sorry, I wasn&#039;t too humble there, huh?) operating on SR.<br /><br />Then it will be a much fuller and tangible realization of the original dream and purpose of SR: to provide a place for people to safely and securely buy items that they normally had to travel to sketchy places to deal with even sketchier people to get.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are committed to SR, we are thrilled with the recent addition of stealth mode and stealth items and we wil be offering an even wider assortment of products for everyone to enjoy (or use for medical purposes, don&#039;t forget there&#039;s a lot of people that are here for that purpose too).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m all for healthy competition: it keeps the prices down where they should be and gives the best values to the end consumer.&nbsp; We have good connections and will always be able to bing you find products at truly reasonable prices.&nbsp; And the reward for that isn&#039;t being #1, the reward for that is having happy customers and making a decent profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck to everybody, no matter what their rank, biggest isn&#039;t the most important thing.&nbsp; I&#039;d much rather us be the best to 1,000 buyers than the biggest to 100,000.&nbsp; <br /><br />But..hehe...that doesn&#039;t mean we aren&#039;t going to try to do both!&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I better get back to packing orders with Ben so we can get our rightful place back at #1. ;)<br /><br />have fun,<br />Alex

				This race to the top of the rankings is a joke, just look at some of the top 10 vendors that have been on here like the guy who scammed everybody with his lotto&#039;s as he was a top 10 vendor on here and a couple of the other big scammers in the past were VERY highly ranked. <br /><br />I am not sure how they ranking works but one of the worst sellers on here MileHigh has very poor rating bouncing between 86-87% but they are the #30 with over 500 transaction on here and yet some of the best sellers on here who always have ratings over 99+% (also over 500 transactions) and never once heard of a bad transaction with them and they are in the late 30&#039;s to mid 40&#039;s for their ranking.<br /><br />I am more interested in the % rating from their feedback then a phoney site ranking that as we have seen in the past makes it easier to pull a big scam just because they are considered top 10. Just like in real life dealing with smaller vendors you seem to get more personal service with the regular vendors instead of dealing with the big boys who seem to spend most of their time chasing the top spot instead of trying to give the best quality service.

				- i would tend to agree in principal<br />- i would say choose the vendor based on historic, track record, level of service and product quality, but<br />&nbsp; the current system makes it quite labour intensive to work out where to buy what...<br /><br />
