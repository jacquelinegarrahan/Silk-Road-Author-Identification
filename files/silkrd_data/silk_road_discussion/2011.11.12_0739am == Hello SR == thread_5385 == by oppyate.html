				Hello everyone! I recently discovered this site as I was reading opiophile.org. Seems like it&#039;s close and selective community. I have a slow and progressive disease that is very painful. Unfortunately due to Govi&#039;s Crackdown on Doctors it&#039;s getting tougher and tougher to get adequate amounts of pain meds due to tolerance. Doc&#039;s now have limitations on prescribing. I hope to help supplement my needs through this very awsome site. Best Wishes to everyone.

				Hi there and welcome:)&nbsp; Sorry to hear about your condition although you will certainly be able to find relief on here. This community is incredible and a perfect place for you detach yourself from an increasingly meddlesome government. I assume you are in the US.

				it is dick that the govt can tell you how much pain you get to be in.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />Welcome to the Road, make sure you peruse the brandspankin&#039; new wiki that our mods just created. It will be able to address just about anything you need to get going.<br />You may want to do a little searching but I remember a thread mentioning something called Ashwaganda that could lower your opioid tolerance thereby giving your meds greater efficiency.<br />Good luck!

				HI Oppy!<br /><br />My name is Genevieve and I am sorry to hear of your situation.&nbsp; Good news is I am in the process of obtaining a seller account on here and we will have lots of pain meds for you at low ball prices.&nbsp; I have been working with a current seller on here the past few days and he (they) are going out of business.&nbsp; I bought lots of his stuff over a 1000 pills to start up and he is super cool he shipped them two-day air on Thursday and they are here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry cant offer the big stuff yet but as of next Thursday I will take over his site or just buy my way in cuz it is only like $150 for a seller account.&nbsp; I will have percs and oxy 15s to start with and will grow from there.&nbsp; My user name for my seller account will be Genevieve so keep an eye out for me.&nbsp; If I take over his account I will just use his name cuz he has a super good rep and is a jewel of a human being.<br /><br />Thats it for now!<br /><br />G

				Vivalasvegas, Towelie Genevieve and Phubbiblues..Thank you for the very Warm Welcome. I am in fact in the Good Old U.S.A. It does suck that Govie is controlling all aspects of our lives now. Despite Tolerance that one develops, regardless if your being treated for Cancer or Pain, Dr&#039;s are now Limited on amounts that can be Prescribed. Several Senators are working hard to tell Docs how to Prescribe. As I&#039;ve been lurking through Forums I do see the Unity to Protect Integrity of SR. I&#039;ll def be hitting you uo Gene&#039;. Please let me know when your up and running. Thanx Again!

				Sorry to hear about your condition. Its getting harder to get adequate pain control by each day. Every State has their own laws.&nbsp; I think a few others are going the road of the state of Washington. I believe a regular doctor can only prescribe the oral equivalent of 60mg of morphine a day or something like that. Which is just&nbsp; a few 10mg hydros.<br /><br />To get any more you have to see a pain specialist. Then they can prescribe whatever. Damned Government loves to take control of everything. I bet one day, every state will be like Washington. I cant remember the other states that have laws similar or have plans on changing them. <br /><br />Pain control will be like the 80&#039;s again. lucky to get codeine for a broken arm...

				Tell you what Chronic. Even Pain Specialists are under the gun. Before it was Oxy&#039;s, Oxymorphone or hydromorphone..Now they go for the hydrocodone that&#039;s a Class III. While that Really Sux..there&#039;s a movement to re-sched hydrocodone to a Class II requiring the same BS paperwork for Dilaudid. What these Six Figure pencil neck Senators dont realize is that just after 10 days, ur Opiate receptors are ready to gobble up more and more. The laws coming out dont take into consideration dependance, not to be confused with addiction. Idiots confuse the two.

				Hey oppyate,<br /><br />Phubaiblues is correct on all counts (as usual.)&nbsp; I&#039;m new here too and just recently made my first orders.&nbsp; New buyers are often required by sellers to finalize early and go out of escrow (esp. if there&#039;s oceans between.)&nbsp; I did for my first to orders, but only after a couple weeks researching sellers and scanning these forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not in a position like yours where I legitimately need medicine I can&#039;t get cause of backwards politics, but you really should take time to find trusted sellers.&nbsp; There&#039;s the Rumor Mill, if you can&#039;t find a thread on a vendor there, you should be weary.&nbsp; There are great, legitimate vendors here, and people know who they are and are very active in sharing that knowledge. <br /><br />Good luck to you, and I&#039;m sure you can find what you need here.&nbsp; SR is a great benefit to people like us, and I think will prove to be an effective way to cut down on (or cut out)&nbsp; the obscene violence created by the ridiculous war they&#039;ve started on people who simply wish to live the way we do.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve found that most people here will help you in anyway they can.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great community, and the honest members are constantly thinking of ways to cut out the bad.&nbsp; It can only improve from here.

				Thank you for welcome Matrix. <br />Subtletly..I have been scouring the various Vendors that offer Opiods. Here is what I am finding. The pricing per MG, be it Hydrocodone or oxycodone is pretty well set at $1.00 or more per MG. Hydromorphone (dilaudid) is out of this world at almost 4.00 per MG! I know the stuff is hard to come by, but if you have Insurance or good connections, Oxycodone/Hydrocodone avgs 25 cents/MG, Hydro/Oxy-morphone(Opana/Dilaudid) maybe 2 bucks/MG at most. I recall other Forums relating to Opiates that the high pricing and laws were going to drive Pain patients to Heroin.<br />The idea that it was actually cheaper and easier to find H than say Oxy or hydromorphone. Personally, I dont see that. <br />Most H Vendors are at $10 or more per MG.<br /><br />We&#039;re all here to cash in on this great opportunity. My personal Opinion is that right now, I can almost bet Dollars to Donuts that &quot;Opiod&quot; Vendors are probably at the High end of profitabilty. Probably an average of 400-500% per MG? It&#039;s all good. At some point good old Market Laws will kick in and someone will shake up pricing to something more realistic. Till then, I&#039;ll just keep looking.
