				Hello there, we are are considering becoming a vendor on the silk road in the very near future.&nbsp; We have been producing psilocybin cubensis for many years on and off.&nbsp; We are capable of keeping up with a large demand and are considering expanding to the silk road.&nbsp; We have used the Silk Road for over a year on other accounts for purchases but have not sold anything through a vendor account and we have a few questions before registering the account.<br /><br />We have several questions regarding shipping, but do not know if they would be appropriate to ask in this forum.&nbsp; Is there by chance a vendor forum that we would gain access to after purchasing the vendor account to discuss our questions with other vendors?&nbsp; If not we will try to keep the questions as vague as possible as to remain as secure as possible.<br /><br />Thanks for any assistance and hope to be able to reveal more details soon,

				Oder stuff from vendors with good packaging reviews. That is the only way you will get the answer to your question.

				Its not the packaging that we are concerned about.&nbsp; We are very confident in our packaging method.&nbsp; We have made many purchases and have picked up various ideas from other vendors along with our own new ideas.
