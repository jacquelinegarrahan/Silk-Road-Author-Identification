				I&#039;ve been lurking these forums for a while, and researching a lot, and I feel like I&#039;m ready to make my first purchase soon. It feels like it&#039;s a lot easier to get ripped off when you&#039;re new, though. Will vendors be more reluctant to do business with you if you&#039;re new?

				Of course its easier for a respected seller to rip off a newb than a respected buyer. For instance I have 40 transactions with 0% refund rate so it would be hard for a seller to get me but a brand new buyer yea they could get you. I would recommend making your first 5 purchases from good vendors. Now since your new they will be leary of you ripping them off by doing a reverse buy scam and they may require you to finalize early but I dont believe that good sellers are going to try 2 rip you off. Just watch who you buy from.

				Thanks, that&#039;s what I was thinking. I guess it wouldn&#039;t be a good idea to buy from a seller who isn&#039;t in the top 20 rank.

				If you need advice about which sellers to deal with you can PM me. I have used alot of sellers on SR and I know which ones can be trusted. I dont purchase coke or meth though so if your interested in those products I cant point you in the right direction. But for almost every other product on Silk Road I have bought it and I could point you in the direction of a seller that wont try to rip you off or do anything shady. That way you can go through a respected seller until your reputation is proven.

				most of them will be reluctant to do business and with you because your new and usually want you to finalize early for your first purchase. i started with willy wonka and the grapist candies because he has a posting up specifically for first time buyers in escrow. once you even have one successful transaction you shouldn&#039;t be asked to finalize early as much. sadly some sellers need you to finalize early no matter what and you have to be carefull who to trust. with mdma aakoven and ivory makes you finalize early but both are trustworthy. Don&#039;t finalize early for a seller that isn&#039;t an OG(over 250 transactions and active in forums with or course positive reviews).&nbsp; some sellers that get honorbale mentions are mdma/ecstasy:mitanox, aakoven, juergan, streethpharmacy and his dank brown rolex,ivory,&nbsp; and dramsterdam is on his way to becoming an OG if he keeps it up. for ketamine go for pharmville. straight pinnate shards that look freshly cooked and the best packaging on sr!. for hash i have only had one experience and that was with tweetb and it was great bubble. also for lsd: bloomingcolor, streetpharmacy, and mitanox. if you need something like meth then go for dopeboy or vortexmilkman since they have been around the longest. other then that read the forums they are your best friend on sr and don&#039;t trust reviews on sr since they can be faked. goodluck man and have fun! i still feel like a kid in a fucked up candy store every time i log in.

				Most of the good vendors on here that have great feedback should be willing to work with you as long as you follow the exact instructions they give (finalizing early doesnt seem like a prob to me). I&#039;ve been doing this online thing for a long time, and can honestly tell you I am very impressed with the level of professionalism that most of the respected vendors on SR have.(and I haven&#039;t even purchased yet!)<br /><br />Becoming a new vendor must be extremely tough here.I know I wont be buying from any zero feedback sellers (sorry to all the legit up and comers) anytime soon..

				New buyer here and it&#039;s really hard to hold off that &quot;kid in a kandy store&quot; behavior.&nbsp; Is there a sticky with some tips for new buyers?&nbsp; What exactly does finalize early mean?&nbsp; After you place an order, is a PM to the seller necessary?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				I never even consider buyers stats when an order comes in.<br /><br />I figure I&#039;ve got proof of posting, and treating a new buyer with the same respect you treat a repeat client is overall the best business practice for me. I&#039;d say a good third of my clients are first time purchasers on here, and I mail their orders out the same day and promote never finalizing early for their protection, same as anyone else.<br /><br />Hell, I figure it&#039;s their first time buying FROM me as well, so I&#039;m on trial as much as they are. Treating them with dignity and respect and not making them jump through hoops due to no fault of theirs doesn&#039;t seem like a good way to build a good relationship.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.

				As a new buyer, I found the process rather easy. Ordered products from two separate, well respected, vendors. Products both shipped extremely quickly, and I finalized and rated (highly) as soon as I could get on Silk Road. Very smooth transactions for both.

				as a new buyer i get the feeling they don&#039;t trust us but they expect us to fully trust them, which i don&#039;t mind but does kind of suck, my 1st purchase was a joke, the 2nd was better but i still ended up with something different from what i thought i was ordering.<br /><br />we will see how orders 3 and 4 go but i aint holding my breath.<br /><br />as for this Escrow thing, it only seems to be any good for buyers with many purchases buying from a new seller.<br /><br />

				After finding SR this month, I&#039;ve made 15 purchases in 19 days.&nbsp; ALL of them using escrow.&nbsp; So far every package has made it to me although the very first package came later than expected but that wasn&#039;t the sellers fault.&nbsp;

				u could quite easily flip the coin with that, it would be very easy for a seller with cred to pan off a new buyer now and then, without any real fear of damage to their cred if they already have a few long term buyers to back them up, then of course these guys are 100% trustworthy eh lol<br /><br />works both ways one has to take the risk and to me the new buyer being told to finalize before product is sent is taking the most.<br /><br />and fook dealing like that IRL your asking to be ripped off even if its involving m8&#039;s, u know like they m8&#039;s that u would never have thought would rip u off lol

				For what it&#039;s worth, my first purchase was back in June with a new vendor.<br /><br />My first purchase was his first sale, and to me that made sense in that he&#039;d come through for sure in order to get his first 5/5<br /><br />He&#039;s disappeared now but he was one of the good guys.<br /><br />If I was a new buyer now I&#039;d place an order with someone like Ivory, HashUK, Jurgen, Mitanox, aakoven tp name just a few sellers who I trust (there are others too of course - all solid sellers with basically no question marks at all). And I&#039;d post in this forum saying &quot;I&#039;m new and I&#039;m going to place my first order with XXX - any feedback on him?&quot;<br /><br />You&#039;ll receive replies for sure, and with a bit of luck your post might even get noticed by the vendor and he&#039;ll reply.<br /><br />But bottom line is you have to accept there&#039;s risk the first couple of times you order. It&#039;s because users with no rep are one of two things - trustworthy people about to embark on a long and satisfying career of purchasing on SR, or they are scammers attempting to get something for nothing because they know a new account has no rep to lose. Hell, they could set up a new one every day.

Vendors trust no one. Escrow protects us ALL. Well established vendors may ask you to finalize early. If you have a tracking or dcn (delivery confirmation number) AND have done business before I would feel comfortable. If not. Wait until you get it. THEN RUN and finalize. Release that escrow! Vendors need it to continue to... well be a vendor.<br /><br />&nbsp;BUT NEVER FINALIZE/RELEASE ESCROW EARLY FOR NEW VENDORS!!! IT&#039;S CALLED GROWING PAINS FOR A REASON. I HAD TO GO THROUGH IT! AND IT MADE ME A BETTER VENDOR OVERALL. YOU SHOULD TO!!! IT IS HARD BUT WELL WORTH THE REWARD. YOU LEARN TO BECOME THE SUPERSTAR YOU THINK YOU ARE/WANT TO BE.

				We really have something special here. We are a community like any other but like no other, disagreements can arise. However, everyone has a level of protection. I believe the market is very fair. At first I honestly could not believe it. Then I was skeptical on how it worked, if it worked, and should I try it. I have been in the game for a very long time. I am new to the scene here, but I enjoy being able to acquire feedback prior to purchase. I personally have developed my own system which I like. I recently made my first purchase from Lexi, she treated me which much respect and was very focused on my satisfaction by shipping my purchase discretely and FAST!!!!!!!! My second order also went well, but with a bit of a delay. The reason I purchased from those sellers was due to the fact I spoke to them prior to ordering. Their feedback also reflected highly. I released my BTC early figuring it was the right thing to do. We need to continue, and have character. I hate Hate HaTTTTE super with a deep passion despise Scammers. Learn how to use PGP, I did in 1 day, communicate wisely and respectfully, and lets get high and enjoy time! Fighting leads to nothing but Drama! which I don&#039;t need or like.

				I love it when new buyers purchase from me. If I can get them to have a nice buying experience with me (under escrow, good communication, speed and quality of packaging), I&#039;ll likely get a faithful customer. More than half of my orders come from buyers who had never bought from me before.

				Unless the vendor is highly reputable (a few have already been named) and clearly a 5/5 %99 of the time guy I would always use escrow, like MrDdroMcGillacutty said, new vendors that haven&#039;t established themselves I think need to be ok with that. Any vendor that I see thats new that has some kind of &#039;finalize early&#039; rule I would stay away from. The fact of the matter is they had to cough up the $ to get started initially and if they are good at their trade (whichever it is) then the money sitting in escrow shouldn&#039;t present that much of a problem
