				I just made my first SR purchase on a legal item... I see everyone on the seller page comments &quot;FE for trusted&quot;, &quot;FE in good faith&quot;, yada yada yada.<br /><br />What is FE? ( My guess is the reputation system )<br /><br />How do I provide (fast) reputation? Whatever the word is. ( I could not figure out how to do this ) <br /><br />I moved funds to my SR bitcoin address.<br />I purchased the item and GPG encrypted my delivery address against the seller&#039;s key.<br />How do i FE? This seller looks pretty trustworthy judging by his reviews. ( Some people give free shipping when you FE (finalize early maybe?) )<br /><br />My order status is still processing and the auto-finalize says (N/A). I&#039;m still unsure of the entire SR process as this is my first purchase.<br /><br />Thanks :)

				When you order something the money you pay stays in &quot;escrow&quot;. Escrow is a system of a thrid party (SR in this case) holding the money until the buyer releases the money. FE = Finalize Early. Basically finalizing early is releasing your money to the seller before you receive your product. <br /><br />Now since you are a new buyer, I would suggest choosing reputable vendors for your first purchases, as you will probably be asked to FE. New buyers can be rivals or scammers who will act as if the order didn&#039;t come, or various other issues can arise from new buyers. Likewise, new vendors can be scammers too, which is why FE is NEVER recommended when buying form a relatively new seller.<br /><br />Now there are some benefits/negatives to FEing:<br /><br />-Your vendor can get the cash quicker to stock up on new product.<br /><br />-Conversely, if you FE you will void your availability to &quot;dispute&quot; a transaction, should you not receive it and the seller refuses to refund you. It is wise to avoid FE unless you trust the seller. I usually FE after a few successful purchases, but never for new sellers.<br /><br />Now if you feel you can trust the vendor, it&#039;s still not always a great idea. A member named &quot;Tony76&quot; scammed tens of thousands of $$$ a few months ago as he was a well reputed vendor. He used this status to get many FEs and took off with his customers (some very loyal) in the past.<br /><br />To Finalize Early, go to the &quot;orders&quot; tab at the top of the SR site and click the transaction number. Here, you will see the option to &quot;finalize&quot; and &quot;resolve&quot;.<br /><br />If finalize isn&#039;t available, this is beause the vendor is still quite new and cannot get early finalizations for about 4 days. (mouseover the text to see the time until the button is clickable).<br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />[Zulu makes a good case with &quot;FE - Good luck getting yo shit&quot; but rememebr as a new buyer, you need to build your rep before peopel will sell to you without FE req&#039;d]
