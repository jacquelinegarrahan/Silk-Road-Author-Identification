				I am sure many are familiar with this... but its good to inform the ones who don&#039;t. There is a clearnet service that I personally only noticed as of recently (last two weeks or so ) that allows anyone on the clearnet to access SR. Obviously this allows anyone who has access to a computer and basic knowledge of google to be able to access the site... Putting &quot;silkroad marketplace&quot; into google will provide you with the clearnet URL to access the site as the top result. Instead of &quot;.onion&quot; the site uses an&quot;onion.to&quot;url, which basically routes through a computer utilizing Tor. It would be incredibly stupid for anyone making purchases or vending to use that link because it is highly likely that the traffic through that link is being logged... But none the less it allows any one who searches &quot;buy drugs online&quot; to only have to click a few links until they are brought to the main page without ever having knowledge of Tor or bitcoin. My worry is that this will bring an explosion in people just going to the site to &quot;check it out&quot; without ever buying anything. This would put an unnecessary load on our beloved SR&#039;s servers. I feel that the providers of &quot;onion.to&quot; are a disgrace to the DeepWeb and are doing more harm then good by completely defeating the point of the Tor browser. What are your guys opinions of &quot;onion.to&quot;, and maybe someone can inform us about how long this service has been active?
