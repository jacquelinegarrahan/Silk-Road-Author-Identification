				I believe it&#039;s against Twitter&#039;s terms of service to engage in unlawful activity through the site, or whatever. They&#039;d much rather just suspend an account than have to deal with getting subpoena&#039;d, and being boycotted over idiots outraged that they allowed so-and-so to use the site

				That doesn&#039;t explain why Atlantis&#039; account, who is also clearly violating their terms, is still up and running. I think it&#039;s also safe to assume Atlantis has probably been using twitter much longer, adding to the suspicion, as DPR&#039;s account was gone within a few hours.

				aliens most likely lol<br /><br />in all seriousness it was obviously LE, we all know for a fact that LE watches the forums everyday and 24/7 they probably have at least one pair of eyes reading these and reporting, just in case someone makes a slip up or DPR announces his twitter feed. Some branch of the governemnt could secretly own twitter. Maybe they didnt even have to ask twitter maybe they did but either way Twitter isn&#039;t gonna say &#039;no&#039; and they&#039;ll just comply and shut DPRofSR down.<br /><br /><br />I knew it wouldnt last long, anyone who followed him during his brief time online probably got flagged too :?<br /><br />We can&#039;t throw these drugs around all day long and not expect them to fight back sometimes...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Very simple.<br /><br />Trolls or disgrunted SR visitors/ex-vendors/ex-buyers..or whoever..you know ...dicks in general propably reported the account or something.<br /><br />Who&#039;s going to report atlantis at this stage:).<br />That would not give the David vs. Goliath satisfaction to the person doing it.

				don&#039;t think there&#039;s any conspiracy, the popo got it shut down but i&#039;m more interested in why atlantis are still on twitter. pretty much cemented in my mind now it&#039;s a honeypot or what the actual fuck. the link on their twitter was onion.sh the other day too. if they aren&#039;t law enforcement.. shit well they are, aren&#039;t they?! they must be. they can&#039;t get us through sr so they tried everything they could think of to get us on atlantis. never going to happen no matter how hard they try. i&#039;d take sobriety over atlantis anyday. i wonder how long they&#039;ll let it run before an explosion of busts...

				Aliens! They want to manipulate SR and cut off communication between us and DPR. They&#039;ve watched us and DPR since the beginning. Once we think he&#039;s gone they will come with a huge ship and fly DPR out of this world. They want his knowledge to build a new drug supply system on their home planet! :O
