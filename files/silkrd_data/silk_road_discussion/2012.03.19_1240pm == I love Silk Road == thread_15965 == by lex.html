				Seriously now, it&#039;s fucking awesome. The guy that created this place deserves every penny he earns from it, combining hidden services and Bitcoin to form something useful like this is absolutely genius. I would LOVE to see the face of a British special branch officer he takes a look at this place and realizes there is absolutely fucking nothing that can be done to shut this place down or hinder the buyers and vendors here in a major way. I don&#039;t need to peach morals to you guys, we are all united under the common belief that we have the right to put into our bodies what we choose, and this is a fantastic, fantastic tool to help us do that. <br /><br />Over the past few months (nearly 1 year!) I have watched SR grow and evolve into its current form. And now I wanna take this opportunity to thank all of the developers, programmers, vendors, sellers, etc etc that has helped make this happen. This is the 21st century and we the people are taking what is rightfully ours. I really, honestly love this place and everything it has become. Well done everyone. And no, I haven&#039;t just taken a handful of good Es, although I feel like it.

				SR is awesome although both anonymous currency and darknets have been used in conjunction to sell drugs for a while now. Although SR&#039;s admin did come up with escrow which I think is genius from a money making standpoint but overall not so good for vendors or customers.

				I wasn&#039;t really talking about scamming, my main beef with escrow is that the customer has to eat the 10% vig (or whatever it is) on top of the cost of whatever they want, while the vendor has to float drugs without recouping money for up to three weeks. Also if the vendor isn&#039;t paying the 4% vig to use the hedge, they stand to lose a lot of money during those three weeks if the value of bitcoins plummet. Oh and it also inherently fosters an adversarial relationship between customers and vendors. :-(

				I love silk road and while escrow isn&#039;t perfect I&#039;ll take it over having to meet with scumbags in person. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s worth it to vendors to have the anonymity as well. What&#039;s 10% when you have 0 chance of getting ripped off if you work in the system?

				I love this place as well. ( had to write that somewhere&nbsp; ;D ) Not everyone has the connections to buy certain things in this life, and there is sometimes just too much risk trying to establish them. Furthermore many people are misinformed when it comes to illegal stuff - they just don&#039;t want to talk about it. Why is it illegal, how does it compare to alcohol/tobacco (in case of drugs) for example - there is no knowledge! So SR allows me to get what I want without shattering other aspects of my life. Beautiful place! <br /><br />*and btw, that&#039;s why I agree to pay the premium on the price. Of course, not mentioning the purity of the products, existence of feedback etc.<br /><br />ps. haters should definitely gtfo

				Who even gives a shit if there are cheaper sources online?<br /><br />If they&#039;re online, anyone could find them. It might take you a day but anyone could fucking find it if they really wanted to.<br /><br />And what about all the other drugs, MDMA, DMT, shrooms, weed, hash, LSD, mescaline?<br /><br />The weed prices are a little high but if I go to a street dealer, even my best guy his 8ths are like 2.6/2.7g MAX.. And that&#039;s the common place thing unless you happen to know the source or he&#039;s a mate. So taking into account the fact that the weed weights here are actually what they&#039;re supposed to be, I think it&#039;s pretty fucking good.<br /><br />DMT costs a lot but GOOD LUCK finding someone on the street who will sell that to you. I&#039;ve been into drug related scenes for years and in that entire time I met ONE guy who sold DMT.. and it was at double the silk road price, and I&#039;m pretty sure it wasn&#039;t even DMT.<br /><br />The hash prices are decent, and the shroom prices are very fair. Shrooms are hard to find on the street, they&#039;re very easy to grow but do you want to wait 2 months with no guarantee of the amount you&#039;ll get?<br /><br />And the MDMA prices are pretty much the same as the street. Here in the UK its £40 a gram, and a &quot;gram&quot; is about 0.6-0.8. And on SR I can get a 1.0 for £45-46. LSD is quite expensive but I&#039;ve never been able to find it in real life. Noone I know can either, and I&#039;ve probably lost about £100+ over the years in buying dud sugar cubes and normal blotter paper. I&#039;m just fucking happy I can finally get LSD.. I don&#039;t particularly care that it costs me £12-15 a tab.<br /><br />Coke is £80 a gram by most street dealers standards and its MASSIVELY cut and you won&#039;t probably get more than 0.8. And it&#039;s about that price on here and significantly more pure. And the heroin prices are pretty much the same as the street too.<br /><br />So with all that being said, anyone that thinks anything other than silk road is amazing is a fucking IDIOT.. OR.. is someone with the best connections in the world. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, I dig it as well.&nbsp; One day, I looked around and discovered I had gotten old and all my druggin&#039; buddies had disappeared.&nbsp; FUCK!&nbsp; The one connection I had was someone I dreaded visiting and he had pretty much quit (marriage seems to do that to a lot of heads) so I finally just quit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Been trying to figure out how to safely score smoke for 2 years then up pops this article talking about SR.&nbsp; It took some digging on my part and the tutorials have been real helpful.&nbsp; The fact that someone makes a profit a) is what freedom is all about, and b) doesn&#039;t keep them from being good folk.<br /><br />I am pleased with the few messages I have exchanged with those from whom I have bought and look forward to building lasting relations with them.<br /><br />SR is absolutely 6/5 . . . oh yeah, and escrow--it&#039;s just one of those little inconveniences forced upon us by those who choose not to behave like human beings.&nbsp; I appreciate all the thought and effort that has gone into building this site and improving it.<br /><br />Cheers

				The thing that i like about SR and my own personal experience is the fact that i can get mdma/mda/shrooms/lsd and some rare benzos and ketamine. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world, but when i took the road of opiates/heroin, i lost all my party drug contacts. because i stopped going to parties and just cared for the needle. and that was about 7 years ago. So imagine my joy when i come to a place that almost promises me what i want @ my doorstep in a few days. <br />Because i&#039;m currently unemployed, i have yet to order something, but this weekend, i&#039;ll be able to spend some $ and maybe order something domestic or from our friends up north(canada).
