				A vendor is doing a reship for me and has said they are waiting for a tracking number to give to me. <br /><br />Apparently he said it was sent last Monday (one prior to this one) but they are yet to receive a tracking number. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering whether the package has been sent or does it take a while to produce a tracking number?

				Your vendor is a liar.<br />Tracking codes are produced two ways by walking into a po and mailing a package and purchasing tracking or but printing out online thru the usps website except the ones you print at home have your address name and type of printer used to make the code.<br />There is no waiting for a tracking code to be produced.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				Another day passes and still no tracking code as promised. <br /><br />Vendor said package &quot;should have been re shipped Mon 28 Jan&quot; and still I&#039;ve got nothing. <br /><br />Emailed them asking if they could clarify why they haven&#039;t received a tracking code after it was apparently send ten days ago. They replied by saying they won&#039;t discuss shipping details &quot;with a client&quot;. <br /><br />Starting to get fairly pissed off now. Especially as they take time off from Thurs through to Tues am.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Can you share what vendor this is? Some vendors don&#039;t like to give out the tracking number unless required to in a SR Dispute as there concerned it can reveal the general area it was shipped from. Usually they state this in there profile or in the listing, and there always usually more then happy to track the package for you and provide you with tracking updates if requested by you. Your case however seems a bit sketchy and you&#039;d think if this was the case they&#039;d tell you they have the tracking number but can&#039;t provide it due to location privacy concerns.<br /><br />Can you please say the name of the vendor so not only other potential buyers are aware of this but also previous buyers from this vendor maybe able to provide you with more information of there past experiences.<br /><br />-LokeToke

Seller feedback/word-of-mouth/reputation is what helps make this thing of ours work so well.<br /><br />Either way I hope everything works out for you, and keep us updated on the outcome.&nbsp; ;)

				Ok so the vendor still hasn&#039;t replied to my email and I know they&#039;ve read it and the one prior. <br /><br />There are other vendors in the same boat as me with the exact same issue.

That&#039;s why I have been so reluctant to inform people who the vendor was. He has a pretty good record and my dealings with him have up until now worked well. <br /><br />I understand vendors are busy people but so to are buyers. I don&#039;t want to have to keep chasing a vendor up for information they said they would give me. And I don&#039;t want to unnecessarily add to the amount of mail they have to read. <br /><br />Fuck this is frustrating and if he had been honest wouldn&#039;t have gotten to this stage.

				I&#039;ve purchased tracking with an order and was never given the number after asking for it, kinda pissed me off, but I looked at it as a form of insurance, should the item never show, the tracking would tell the story to both the vendor and the SR resolution team. Fair enough that way.

				It sounds like he is bullshitting u buddy.. Sometimes vendors will do it, or maybe he is getting fucked and it causing&nbsp; a chain reaction..<br /><br />Hope you did not FE..DO NOT FE EVEN IF HE SAYS I WILL GIVE U THE TRACK IF U DO..DONT!!<br /><br />Also I hate not getting a tracking #from a vendor, I normally only deal with vendors who provide it.. I mean whats the big deal for vendors to give it out? The info is the same on both ends, iv read its because so the buyer cant claim they d not get it, but the info is the same for whoever checks it..<br /><br />I think Tracking should be giving to ppl who want it, t makes us feel more secure and KNOW FOR A FACT its on the way and how much longer we have to wait..<br /><br />When vendors wont give it out, us buyers R just sitting here hoping it comes today or hoping it comes tomorrow,not knowing nothing, and thats kinda fucked up to me, then the vendor does not want u to MSG HIM AND ask whats up an to check it for like 5 days sometimes, so why not always give us the tracking?<br /><br />So what if we go in resolution? its gonna say the same thing on both ends who check it, its not like the buyer can change the USPS INFO to make it appear not delivered..<br /><br />Anybody agree?? And to vendors reading this explain why it is a big deal and why u guys get the sole power of having this info but not the man.women who is paying u for it?

Sometimes vendors will do it, or maybe he is getting fucked and it causing&nbsp; a chain reaction..<br /><br />Hope you did not FE..DO NOT FE EVEN IF HE SAYS I WILL GIVE U THE TRACK IF U DO..DONT!!<br /><br />Also I hate not getting a tracking #from a vendor, I normally only deal with vendors who provide it.. I mean whats the big deal for vendors to give it out? The info is the same on both ends, iv read its because so the buyer cant claim they d not get it, but the info is the same for whoever checks it..<br /><br />I think Tracking should be giving to ppl who want it, t makes us feel more secure and KNOW FOR A FACT its on the way and how much longer we have to wait..<br /><br />When vendors wont give it out, us buyers R just sitting here hoping it comes today or hoping it comes tomorrow,not knowing nothing, and thats kinda fucked up to me, then the vendor does not want u to MSG HIM AND ask whats up an to check it for like 5 days sometimes, so why not always give us the tracking?<br /><br />So what if we go in resolution? its gonna say the same thing on both ends who check it, its not like the buyer can change the USPS INFO to make it appear not delivered..<br /><br />Anybody agree?? And to vendors reading this explain why it is a big deal and why u guys get the sole power of having this info but not the man.women who is paying u for it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />He hasn&#039;t replied to my email but has replied in this mephedrone thread with &quot;And Ktown/Drugskon your stuff is being dealt with, you&#039;re the last two issue that need to be sorted.&quot;<br /><br />When he said two weeks ago that he &quot;should have been sent&quot;, it probably wasn&#039;t. <br /><br />Clearly he has had problems but hasn&#039;t been forthcoming with updates. That pisses me off because when you enter into a business relationship, communication must go both ways especially when dealing with DRUGS ARRIVING IN THE MAIL! <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;m being unfair - do people agree or disagree with this?<br /><br />Also why don&#039;t vendors supply tracking? One thought is that it identifies where the package was picked up from and this may help LE close in on a vendor.
