				I&#039;m probably using the wrong tool, but if I import SR&#039;s key into Kleopatra, save the message at the top of the thread to a text file, then &quot;decrypt/verify&quot; it in Kleopatra it fails. I&#039;ve tried using .asc and .txt file extensions.

				One thing helped me, when Kleopatra kept coming up wrong, was to make sure that the text document I copied to, had wordwrap *off*.&nbsp; If not, I was having the same problems other newbies are, when transferring from email, say, to notepad: I&#039;d save it as an .asc document, in &#039;all files&#039; but had forgotten to turn wordwrap off.&nbsp; So if you&#039;re transferring it, go to format, and make sure wordrap is unchecked...Soon as I got that right, it worked fine.&nbsp; Sane linux users won&#039;t have problem.

				You can decrypt/verify etc. in Kleopatra without putting things into notepad.<br /><br />If you right click the icon in your taskbar, you can do various things to whatever you have in your clipboard (so in other words you need to copy the public key using CTRL+C but you don&#039;t have to paste that anywhere)
