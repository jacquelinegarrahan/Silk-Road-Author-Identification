				Nah. I don&#039;t think they are hoping to get us to go to their site, sounds like they are going to sleep every night thinking of hurting us. It&#039;s more of a personal thing. I always wonder isthereanyneed for it....<br /><br />One person unfortunately bought off their site and was scammed, so yeah, they&#039;re that too. I&#039;ve always wondered, how hard is it to be a spambuster? Can anyone do it or does it have to be someone who is a die-hard techie? Out of sheer curiosity....

				Yeah it looks like the 50 post limit hasn&#039;t deterred them (guessing its the same person).&nbsp; It only has caused spamming by real members in that forum.<br /><br />I am guessing SR needs better capcha (could be manual though), maybe mods or a voting system to hide the posts/threads?

				You should have seen what it looked like a month ago. 80% of all the threads you could see were spam. Tessellated is currently running a dedicated attack, keeping them down - You should see the thread, its pretty awesome:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109831.0

				Yeah its very irritating, i can&#039;t believe people actually bought off of their site. How much do people go on about not trusting anyone and making sure you use TSR safely, then go on to buy under priced BTC from a vendor spamming an entire board? Seems pretty stupid to me.<br />They&#039;re back up on the newbies board now.

				Too bad the only staff member admin or mods that would have gone thru the membership banned all the plus 50 post spammer accounts is now no longer a mod. <br />This would have solved the spammer in the main forum issue. The newbie section is very well serving it&#039;s purpose to bottleneck spammers.<br />Just another example of knowing when to hold them and knowing when to fold them gone wrong.

				If you come on this forum not a clue about btc or scams or anything to do with road and you see one of those spams just the one like there is now not a full board it would be fairly easy to get a little excited and maybe fall for this scam I think ages around 17-21 would fall for it the most that said maybe not but its a pain in the arse either way just fucks up the flow of the forums.<br /><br />Any one know where their from UK/US/EU, I bet their Nigerian it has their stamp!<br /><br />

				There are solution to rule out the scammers completely.<br /><br />On bitcointalk,org what is a site special for bitcoins, you will not find a spam scammer , never!<br /><br />So There is a solution and it puzzles me why the same solutions are not implemented here.<br /><br />Maybe if we stop rewarding just removing those post with bitcoins, maybe that would help.<br /><br />Now the mods are making money from those spam scammers.<br />When there is no profit to be made anymore, maybe then will this forom just as free of spam as bitcointalk.org.

It pains me to edit this post, it really does. The fact that I should be worried about my good reputation on Silk Road being sullied by trolling. I won&#039;t do it. I&#039;m not going to get into an argument and start flinging at you, and vice versa, until it fills a whole page. But..... why is everyone here so eager to be a dick? Is it national dick week? You newbs have been flinging the finger at everyone (well, a lot anyway) and talking shit like usual and, to be frank, Raz is starting to get bored. Why bother coming here? If someone has got something to say, know what ypu&#039;re actually saying or you&#039;ll come off like a dick. Friendly advice. And if you can get offended by that, I&#039;m not trying hard enough, or you&#039;re too sensitive.

We can&#039;t do anything but delete it because of the nature in which tor and hiddenservices operate. As far as the forum knows, every piece of spam comes from the same IP address (127.0.0.1). The only way we could reliably block the spam permanently is to block that IP address. That would lock everyone out of the forums. We spend our time, knowing that we aren&#039;t being paid for our services, working to keep the spam removed just so that no one, new or old, will suffer from the scam. The fact that you think we are making money from that pile of shit upsets me greatly.&quot;<br /><br />And a Blargh personal note to add in with the translation is this... You guys are being ungrateful pricks to the mods. They really do work their asses off just to keep this place cleaner then it would be.<br /><br />Edit: &quot;You guys&quot; means people like wasta, just for clarification.

				I allready thought that you guys think that they at bitcointalk can stop the spam because of the abillity to block IP-adresses.<br /><br />I know you &quot;&quot;think&quot;&quot; that, but know too that you you not know for sure.<br /><br />Just thinking is not enough. <br />Their ability to block spam has nothing to do with ip addresses.<br /><br />It&#039;s sad you don&#039;t take the time to find out and do some research.<br /><br />Then you know so and don&#039;t have to &quot;think so&quot;&quot; anymore....<br /><br />Or not? Blarghrawr<br /><br /><br />You have not asked for btc but made a tread just the same<br /><br />APPRECIATE OUR MODS? SLIP ON OVER TO SR and SEND &#039;EM A COIN<br /><br />Never received a coin? Bad luck I&#039;ve seen enough going your way. <br />Even Pine who did herself enough did even slip 1 btc over for removing a few threads.<br /><br />I guess you want to stop , or at least want me to stop and save the last word for yourself.<br />Some want always the last word.<br />But I think too that enough time is wasted here.<br />But don&#039;t deny.<br /><br />Or put your money where your mouth is and slip me over evry coin I know to find that you guys hace received.<br />Oh, the admins became the money while you mods did the work....yeah, I know one when I see one.<br /><br />Thing is the exclusion of spam can be done in more then one way.<br />No point to mention a few, they are not going to be implemented anyway.<br />So I will not waste my time.<br />That&#039;s your hobby, so it seems by removing and removing and removing.<br /><br />There is a answer (like at bitcointalk) but I don&#039;t care if you don&#039;t want to take measurements.<br />&nbsp;But it is not my time of fun.<br /><br /><br />I could paste a lot of idea&#039;s, but I have better things to do with my time.<br /><br />But I know I mentioned;<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to make it impossible to post the same post twice etc.<br /><br />I have asked to often why this is still allowed.<br />Don&#039;t allow certain words that the scammer is using like the word bitcoin , with or without the combination with other words that keep coming back.<br />As I have given a lot more solutions.<br />Never a answer...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />If I gave you the solution on a silver platter you rather spend your time deleting spam.<br />Everybody their hobby, but it&#039;s not my kind of a good time...<br /><br />And about DPR, I have sugested some solutions agains spam to her too. She said nothing having to do with this forum, I should turn to the admins or mods , she is busy with the mainsite... <br />But if the mods and admins don&#039;t listen, There will be scamming spam till the end of days.
