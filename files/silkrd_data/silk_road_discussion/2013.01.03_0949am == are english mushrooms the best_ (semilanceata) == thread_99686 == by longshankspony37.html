				The 2 main active ingredients in magics are the same for all species.&nbsp; These may be different in different amounts and the proportions are different in fresh and dried shrooms as one doesn&#039;t survive in air very well.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that other compounds contained in the shrooms are responsible for things like dodgy stomach so side effects may differ between species / strains but generally you&#039;re getting a very similar hit from every species.&nbsp; Some species taste better than others so that might be a consideration.<br /><br />The best strains I have tried are also the strongest I have tried.&nbsp; I think this is because you have to take less material meaning that both taste and side effects are reduced.&nbsp; These are &quot;Hawaiain&quot; Panoleus cyanescens and &quot;Philosopher&#039;s stone&quot; Pscylocybe tampanensis (sclerota).&nbsp; The buzz is pretty similar for all psylocybin containing shrooms though. (I find fresh more visual and dried more psycological but that may just be me or the dosage)

On Wood/Mulch: Psilocybe subaeruginosa (sometimes also called blue meanie or copper top), <br /><br />I have friends who say there is also Ps. Semilanceata in Australia.. <br /><br />I think the strongest mushrooms in the world are probably Ps Azurescens ..

				Great descriptions there guys, +1 to each of you, was great reading that. :D<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had stomach aches from eating shrooms, i sometimes eat them fresh but prefer to dry them.<br />Next season i will pick a lot, found a great new place to pick them.<br /><br />Ps. Semilanceata..Didnt know we had these? :o Wonder if they grow in all states...? Will find out. ;)

				Obviously all strains are good.<br /><br />With english mushrooms you have to take 50-100 to trip.&nbsp; My friend went to Canada(I think) and he had some shrooms that you only had to eat like 5 to get a full on trip.&nbsp; He said they were bigger than UK shrooms, but even so it sounds like they were much stronger.

				Damn 50-100 for one trip? I&#039;m lucky to find that many in one pick.<br /><br />Yeah 6 here will make you trip for sure if they are a nice size.<br /><br />
