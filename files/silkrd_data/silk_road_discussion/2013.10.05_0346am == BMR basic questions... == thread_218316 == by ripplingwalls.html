				i already had a BMR account, and just joined the forum a couple of days ago.&nbsp; My confirmation was almost immediate.&nbsp; I am funding my account through localbitcoin.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know another way.&nbsp; I used a couple of solid vendors on the road so the localbitcoin path is new to me.

				thanks for answering man, and yea my shit got verified today so im now on it (different name of course, cuz LE is watchin) but anyway someone needs to get on the ball and make an anonymous, free trading escrow site where one &quot;barters&quot; items for btc. no listings up so they wont see a reason to shut it down, people come and go and conduct transactions privately, securely and most importantly itll give buyers a sense of security when it comes to their shit being shipped. someone, GET ON IT asap. cuz theyll shut down BMR soon, mark my words. they took down SR, they will take down BMR. so the only solution would be to develop a place where one can make private transactions

				If you&#039;re talking about a straight up plain escrow site for bitcoins, they certainly already exist... for example:<br /><br />http://btcrow.com
