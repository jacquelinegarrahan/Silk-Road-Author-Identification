				Has never taken me more than a few hours which is pretty standard for BTC transfers. Occasionally there are delays though, just the way it goes sometimes.

				I&#039;ve wondered about this too, actually. I send my btc from one wallet to another before sending off to SR. The non-SR transfers are always pretty much instant, while SR is generally hours. I&#039;m certainly not complaining, but I was curious as to the reason behind it.&nbsp;

A new block is mined approximately every 10 minutes. This counts as one &#039;confirmation&#039;.<br /><br />However, SR waits for (I think) 5 more blocks, so that your transaction is confirmed 6 times over as valid before it allows your BTC to be seen in your SR wallet.<br /><br />It&#039;s basically a way of protecting SR against the dreaded &#039;double spend&#039; attack, which means you deliberately spend the same coins twice. I don&#039;t know how feasible it is to do a double-spend, but by the time the transaction has been confirmed several times, it becomes pretty much impossible to do.<br /><br />I sound like a freakin expert! It&#039;s amazing what you can pick up around here!

				Mine has never taken more than one hour from Bitinstant OR local bitcoin, so I have always been pleased with the amount of time it takes for my bitcoin to show up.
