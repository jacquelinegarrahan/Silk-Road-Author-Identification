				And where would you like it shipped fellow Silk Roader? I will make International shipping available on a region by region basis, as the costs to deliver heavy glass bottles varies greatly from country to country.

				Ok, I&#039;m gonna give it a shot, just ordered a sample. I&#039;ve always wanted to try Absinthe but never had a reliable source for it. Hopefully this pans out. I&#039;ll be sure to update with my experience.

				That&#039;s a price better than fucking liquor, AND it&#039;s hallucinogenic AND it&#039;s on SR, which normally costs more than street prices! <br /><br />Better reserve me a ticket for the S.S. UnWizard&#039;s maiden voyage!

				Unwizard, if your absinthe is a European import, I am definitely onboard, as I&#039;ve enjoyed a few bottles of the stuff while stationed in Germany.&nbsp; But, I second Seeker&#039;s question:&nbsp; is this a home brew?

				I only sell artisanal absinthe,&nbsp; micro distilled in North America and based on a very traditional Swiss recipe. It has a higher wormwood and thujone content than that allowed by American or European Union regulations.

Gotta say, fast shipping. I was very surprised, I thought it would come later than it did. And the packaging was sufficiently safe for the contents and discreet. Stealth (i.e. disguise) was not really an issue. The information included was nice too, thanks a lot for that!<br /><br />A friend and I split the sample, I took about 60mL and he about 40mL, in 20mL increments. We diluted it with an equal amount of water and added a teaspoon of sugar to the mix, then sipped it slowly, over the course of 20-30 minutes per drink. My friend said he couldn&#039;t report any psychedelic effects, but felt some additional wakefulness. He added some green dragon he had to his second glass and he says that it &quot;went well.&quot;<br /><br />I can&#039;t assume the ABV of the sample, but I&#039;d say it&#039;s probably somewhat stronger than your standard 80 proof liquor... after diluting it, it was still strong. The taste is primarily of anise, but has a nice flavor background making it richer than the American &quot;absinthe&quot; I&#039;ve had before. It&#039;s a tad bitter too, which I didn&#039;t expect. The oils inside it were unpleasant, but I think that this is an unavoidable consequence of getting the herbal extracts into the drink. It was simply a bit slimy, and I didn&#039;t expect that either. With sugar it had a nice aftertaste, which lingered for hours, hinting of anise and citrus. It&#039;s not harsh on the throat either.<br /><br />As for myself, I noticed about 15 minutes after having the drink that I felt different than if I had taken some other drink. I couldn&#039;t put it into words. After the second drink I could tell that there were stimulant properties... I felt energetic and awake. I also began to experience coronas around shapes which contrasted the background, e.g. letters on signs. After the third drink I began to experience slight vision trails and some static, but no shifting, patterning, or fractals or anything like that. If I weren&#039;t looking for it, I&#039;d probably have missed it. This may indicate a +/- experience. On the other hand, I couldn&#039;t help but notice the empathy I began to feel. Seeing the word &quot;rape&quot; actually made me uncomfortable, which would only happen to me on an empathogen or a psychedelic. My recollection also improved - I was able to recall archaic knowledge for which I would normally have no use, but was useful in conversation. I felt generally sharp, as I often do on &quot;functional&quot; stimulants or on some psychedelics such as 4-AcO-DMT and DOB. As for drunkenness, the third drink had me feeling buzzed. Unpleasant side effects: small headache. I would not classify absinthe as a psychedelic for this reason; rather, it&#039;s really in a class of its own. Wikipedia tells me that thujone is actually a 5-HT3 antagonist (among other things), which interests me because so is ondansetron, a really helpful antiemetic that I tend to keep on hand for psychedelics with heavy body load such as 2C-E.<br /><br />For the price, I would put this drink as a novelty - but a novelty that everyone who drinks should enjoy at least once, if not several times. I would suggest that this might be a drink with which to celebrate special occasions, such as reuniting with old friends or getting a promotion. Rather than blacking out, you might enjoy the night better and remember it clearer - and I believe that you will enjoy yourself more while on this absinthe than on whatever else you might have had.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
