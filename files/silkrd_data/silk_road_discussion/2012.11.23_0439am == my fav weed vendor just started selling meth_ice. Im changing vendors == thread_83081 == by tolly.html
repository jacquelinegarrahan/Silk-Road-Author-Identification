				Well changing vendors was my first thought. Then I realised maybe Im judging others drug of choice and also my weed vendor the right to supply them with quality product and make a dollar.Ive had a great relationship with him but Im not sure how I stand on this. Would you weed smokers dump your vendor if he started offering meth? Should I take off the white wig and stop fucking judging?

				yeah that&#039;s sort of like the pot calling the kettle black.<br /><br />no pun intended. <br /><br />i think weed is the hardest thing for people to ship through the mail, so cut the guy some slack.

				I don&#039;t see a reason to stop shopping with that vendor. If you have a good relationship and he still stocks the product you want at a price you&#039;re willing to pay for, keep working with him. The fact that he&#039;s also dealing other products shouldn&#039;t interfere with your relationship with him. No need to get all paternalistic here.

				All good points guys. I guess its that Religious upbringing creeping in and making me judge others life choices. He has always been great so who am I to judge just because Ive never tried it and in reality know stuff all about it. Thanks Again

				@tolly, thanks for being willing to change your mind.<br /><br />Another way of looking at this is, we need to protect and support the rights of others to do things we don&#039;t necessarily approve of, to protect and support our own rights. As long as a transaction is peaceful I don&#039;t see how we can condemn it.

				I wouldn&#039;t care. As long as it ain&#039;t effecting my transactions with them or the quality of my product.<br />I only smoke ganja too but I&#039;d encourage someone wanting to sell meth, to sell clean good meth. So as long as this vendor is doing that I wouldn&#039;t have a problem.

				If your vendor is a good guy, gives you a price you like, and doesn&#039;t rip anyone off... then no, you shouldn&#039;t be changing vendors.<br /><br />Don&#039;t judge your vendor by what he sells... unless he buys moneypaks for bitcoins. So many scams in that direction, y&#039;know? :(

				Honestly I wouldn&#039;t stop going through a vendor that has a product that I want/like just because he offers other things. Remember he hasn&#039;t wronged you in the past why would he start now?

BUt if a vendor has some bomb ass weed, and everyone on the road is talking about it or something then the fact that a vendor sells meth wouldn&#039;t stop me from buying some. That&#039;s all I really mean.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah fair enough I suppose... it&#039;s just a bit ridiculous IMHO.<br /><br />Perhaps sir would like his bud sitting a top a naked super model, or filtered through Diamonds?&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>And that just gave me a great idea.

I&#039;m talking about filtering BHO, you were talking about bud. But hey, I think there&#039;s also a market for a bubbler or something with diamonds in one of its chambers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />fair play mate, go forth.... you have my blessing...&nbsp; &nbsp;8)
