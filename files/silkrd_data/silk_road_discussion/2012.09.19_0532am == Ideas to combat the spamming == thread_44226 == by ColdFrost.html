They won&#039;t stick around if its not worth it to them. The best way I can think of is for forum members to keep talking about possible scams, name and shame people and share information in an open/inclusive way. Captchas are an option but can be a bit of a pain, but perhaps worth it. <br /><br />I was targeted earlier in the week about Mt Gox deals, but a couple of those on the email string said it was a scam. They stopped me from wasting my time checking it and discovering for myself that it was a scam. <br /><br />

				Doesn&#039;t SMF support moderation queues? Just set it so that all posts made by newly registered users have to be approved until the user makes X amount of posts. Even if the queue is flooded with spam, fuck it! SR needs some time off from the flux of noobs anyway so it can scale to handle the demand.

				^^If there is no moderation queue feature, then restricting the ability to PM and start new threads to a certain post count would be the next best thing. Both solutions have the potential to &quot;censor&quot; the alt accounts, whistleblowers, and supposed government insiders. Too bad there isn&#039;t a &quot;community&quot; moderation queue where users can volunteer to transparently flag the obvious spam.<br /><br />They can also try combining email confirmation, strong captcha, and only allowing new users to post one new thread every few hours. That would more than quadruple the shitstain&#039;s workload. Modifying SMF to only allow newly activated accounts to create threads after an arbitrary delay--while also having the thread actually show up to only that account if spam is detected--would cripple any current bot.

				How about the PGP test idea via a tormail account? And the people who dont know of either are pointed to the forums to learn, because its how alot of us did. Not just for spam but to filter the people who arent serious. and then only one forum account per account on the main site? PGP test would make signing up for an acount abit longer and maybe not worth there time as they have to setup a bunch of accounts (tormail,new PGP key) before accessing SR. At the moment making a shill account or new account in an attempt to scam Vendors and spam the forums is all too easy.<br /><br /><br /><br />or we could just ask there social security/government ID number. That way when we finally get pawned all the journos, politicians and LE daughters who use this would get pwn&#039;d aswell ;)

				I don&#039;t not know about forcing anyone into using a particualr email provider. If you guys recall, you actually do not even need to provide an email to register here. It should stay that way in my opinion. It is an anon forum after all.<br /><br /><br />Combating these clowns with a manual approval process will only slow SR admins down even more. <br /><br />I think the answer has already been found in create a newbie forum (must have 50 posts/ 7days registered) before you can post outside. <br /><br /><br />...something like that. Yeah it will piss off the trolls that reg an accnt just to talk shit on one particular thread, but put it in place until this Mt.

				We dont need more captchas that dont work, especially seeming most the people posting on here are fucked anyway and can probably barely fucking read (example: me). Theres plenty of anonymous email providers or how about Submitting a new PGP key. its been awhile since i set it up but i Think it did take a period of time to Generate a keypair when i did.

				I think the PGP test should definitely be refined and discussed as a way of balancing the recent influx of noobs. However, assuming the short term goal is to make spamming as difficult as possible, it would be a good idea to implement some of the admin controls included in every modern forum package.<br /><br />If a moderation queue would slow things down too much, you can always just limit newly registered accounts to one new topic or PM every few hours. It won&#039;t stop the spam, but it will severely limit his ability to do it quickly without using any additional resources, and whistleblowers, USPS insiders, etc will still be able to post important threads from alt accounts.

				Seeing as I use the same forum software on Shroomtastic, how about a workable Idea<br /><br />You can set permission sets for a given board on the forum so you should be able to create a board where new members can post and not allow them to post anything in the rest of the board tell they hit 10 posts or what ever you set it to.<br /><br />Then set the permissions on that forum board where everyone who has more than 300 posts can moderate that forum board.<br /><br />This should allow new users a place to come in and talk as well as create 1000&#039;s of mods all of whom can delete the spam without taking up SR staff time. That also means that anyone with more than 300 posts can delete any comment on that board and it could be abused but it sure would get rid of the spam.

				^^Finally, someone who knows SMF!!<br /><br />+1 for the very specific ideas. I can&#039;t imagine what the noob forum would like after a while though. Having so many mods would be dangerous, especially if you can&#039;t undo actions like thread/post deletion. Maybe they can find some of the early, helpful members and figure out when they usually browse the forums, then pick a mod for every 2-3 hour time block or something.

				I agree with the notion that there should be restrictions in place to combat spam. It may not be horrible right now, but as SR grows in popularity, it&#039;s inevitable that others are going to try to do the same as MtGix. <br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with the idea that one would need X posts or wait X time before being allowed to create a thread or post outside a specific forum. If a SR newb gets scammed, he/she should have the ability to make a thread and inform others about that vendor. Especially MoneyPak scammers, who need to be combated ASAP, lest they make away with thousands of dollars. There are better ways to lift posting restrictions.<br /><br />I think tying an SR account [with a purchase?] to a forum account would help. Perhaps with an SR account you can post one thread a day, having one with a purchase lets you post multiple threads.and remove potential forum captcha (mentioned below).<br /><br />Other ideas to combat advertising spamming: <br />1) Auto-gag (temp ban) and hide threads whose titles contain a &quot;ban word.&quot; MtGix, 79.99, etc. Make these ban-words visible in a sticky so people don&#039;t make the mistake of posting, &quot;Guys, is MtGix legit?&quot;&nbsp; <br />2) Hide threads that have a url in the title. Don&#039;t make this knowledge public. If possible, make the thread not hidden for the one that posted it, so he/she has no idea it&#039;s been hidden. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s possible with this forum&#039;s software allows for it, though.<br />3) Implement captcha on the forums. This particular one is doing his posts manually, but in the future couldn&#039;t we get hit by some bots?<br />4) Auto-gag users that post the same thread title or post 3 or more times in a row.<br /><br />In reality, it is impossible to fully stop spam. If he wants to make a dozen dummy accounts, give &#039;em each 100 posts, wait a week, tie each one to an SR account with a small purchase, generate a dozen keys, and start posting variations of his advertising as <br /><br />Selling BTC 10 for 79.98 MtG(I)x.c(o)m remove parentheses<br />Selling BTC 10 for 79.97&nbsp; MtG(I)x.c(o)m remove parentheses<br /><br />there&#039;s really nothing stopping him. No amount of restrictions would make it flat out impossible. The only thing we concern ourselves with is what measures we can take to make it too much of a hassle on the spammer without hurting the community.<br /><br />I&#039;ve backpedaled and edited this post a bunch of times, so I&#039;m sure I stopped making sense somewhere. I&#039;ll check back after work/class/whatever I&#039;m off to.

You can further build on that by only allowing the newbie section mods to move threads to a hidden recycle bin forum rather than allowing them to outright delete things.

				Lets be real for a minute. If this were to get implemented, there would just be a &quot;chat shit&quot; thread started in the noob section and they would sit in there having a circle jerk for a few hours just to reach the post count. I agree with agorist concept just don&#039;t think it will work in this situation. There&#039;s a mod online basically at anytime as it is now and the ads only stay up for a short period of time, it&#039;s not really that big of a deal.

				^^That&#039;s why I originally suggested limiting newly registered accounts to one new topic every few hours. If this really is one guy sitting there manually registering accounts, that one change will more than double his workload without significantly interfering with the forum as it is now. Make the delay long enough for admins to be able to ban the accounts before they can post again, but short enough to still allow legit new users to ask questions or post important information as needed. <br /><br />Although the spam is annoying, I agree that it&#039;s nothing dire and creating an introduction/noob section should be a last resort. Dunno if SMF supports this, but the moderation queue (manual post approval for very new accounts) would be a safer choice as long as we&#039;re thinking of adding new mods anyway. As long as someone is always on and there are some basic measures in place to prevent DoS of the queue.

				Creating all these forum rules is basically the equal to creating class warfare IRL. Bunch of baby Reagans running around here.

				LOL we&#039;re just trying to prevent a future denial of service condition. Besides, it&#039;s fun to come up with ideas that make scammers work harder. Let&#039;s put our friend perky/lovestotrip through spammer college. Maybe then he&#039;ll graduate to real spam and become the next Sanford Wallace, effectively leaving SR alone hahah

				LOL, Perky...Can I just DOx the guy every time he posts from now on? Would probably make him think about it at least for a fraction of a second the next time he tries to scam.
