				Not sure if I posted this in the right place, but I just needed to pout about finally getting cash to order more than just a gram and I come back to SR to find the N. Amer coke drought :(&nbsp; I just had to whine to somebody. done now.

				Right? I&#039;m a newbie to the SR concept but not to blow. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m from the Southern US, but, god damn are prices over hyped here.<br /><br />I would never buy my white from here though, it&#039;s absurd for me to spend a 100 on a gram and then add shipping from Germany, fuck no! When I can get grams of flake for 40-50 here, down the street. Maybe not something piss yellow like a few legit vendors are carrying here, but it wouldn&#039;t be difficult if I really put my mind to it.<br /><br />But hot damn will I ever buy the SHIT out of Euro MDMA! mmmmmmm&nbsp; ;D

				Yeah, coke in particular is expensive on here, but it&#039;s worth it for me since $50 in my neck of the woods basically gets you speed cut with a little coke. I just make sure I pick a vendor that I know has quality. $100+ a gram has done me well here since I check everything out like crazy before I order from someone new. Everything I&#039;ve gotten here so far was way better quality than I&#039;ve ever seen otherwise. And I&#039;m too sketched out by customs to go overseas. Not long ago there was a healthy list of US/Can vendors that had real quality. I&#039;m sure there will be again, but this WOULD happen when I&#039;m ready to lay down some cash. I apologize to you all for jinxing it lol.

				For Brits SR is a GODSEND for Bing, although the gay situation of the drought is a bit shit at the moment.<br /><br />Also Bing that is piss-yellow does not necessarily mean it is good. The yellow comes from bi-products that are left in during the synthesis.

				Pure crystal can have a funky shade of anything to it. Color will be leached quite easily after numerous washes and recrystalizations. Yellow tends toward a more pure product in my neck of the woods because only a few people have had their hand in passing it down the line. <br /><br />Of course this is all speculation, the best coke is coke that is reagent tested or heat tested. Even a simple finger rub can denote the quality on the fly if need be.<br /><br />No jinx intended. Maybe it would be prudent of a domestic supplier to start up a vendor page? In time, we shall see.

If the yellow is stronger it will just be slightly more washed or a cleaner synthesis.

Crystal structure will develop color based on gravitational, chemical, and thermal properties. So many things go into play during synth and following during washes that anything is reasonably possible.
