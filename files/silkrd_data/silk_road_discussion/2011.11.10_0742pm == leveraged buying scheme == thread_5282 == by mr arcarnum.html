				Hi all I just had a small brainwave of a way that I think could make buying a little more safe. this is just a theory and im looking forward to you all poking holes, just dont start flaming me, its good to share thoughts!<br /><br />essentially it is all based on buyers and sellers feedback<br /><br />at the moment alot of vendors require people with none or very little to pay upfront before goods are received, which to be honest if the vendor is trustworthy is not a problem. <br /><br />but problem being if the vendor is a new dude it really takes the first guy to take the plunge and have some either shit warez or receive none at all<br /><br />so my theory is dependant on feedback state silk road could be the man in the middle as such, they suspend the payment until either the buyer says &quot;got the goods&quot; or &quot;its legit&quot; and the escrow is then released to the new vendor, HOWEVER it is not available to new members or people with low feedback or very little enabling those who are proven buyers to give them a little security, this would further deter scammers because then they arent gonna make a quick buck, and by enabling people who are trustworthy buyers the ability to &quot;test&quot; the water as such for new buyers and new people it makes it alot more friendly and safe, now I dont know how safe it would be for SR to be the man in the middle but I think this system sounds pretty good, of course I know myself I am new and I am yet to make a purchase ( payday soon!) but im digging the community spirit and like to post on here.<br /><br />post your thoughts guys and gals!

				What you described is escrow.&nbsp; It is designed to be that man in the middle.&nbsp; It&#039;s a new thing, for vendors to request that it be lifted, bypassed, finalized early.&nbsp; &nbsp;Escrow is &#039;the man in the middle.&#039;&nbsp; We don&#039;t need to find a new way to replace escrow, we just need to restore escrow, and find a new way for vendors to cope with deadbeats.&nbsp; New people have just as much right to escrow as anybody else.<br /><br />If I choose to lift escrow, it&#039;s on me, and strictly a courtesy to vendors I trust.&nbsp; The fact that it&#039;s become something else is unfortunate.

				That was all gibberish, although I am sure he meant well !! Al little SR story to illustrate the reality of doing business here:<br /><br />When I heard of SR through the Gawker expose, I just happened to have a crucial medical need. I was at a dead end with no hope. I started the process, and chose two vendors based on ratings, and everything went wrong, to the point of the SR staff getting involved. Its not that the shipping went wrong, it was that just these two vendors, well known back a half year ago, had all of their shipments go MIA. Two vendors, 40 odd orders totaling 4K$, GONE. They knew this because of the number of resolutions sought by a great diversity of buyers, old and new.<br /><br />strange eh? My first experience on SR 6 months ago. Just about. <br /><br />Now, here is a question: Your most trusted vendor, your go to guy, suddenly goes MIA and you hear nothing or he leaves with a&nbsp; cryptic update to his page saying, &quot;I gotta take a vacation&quot;. Can&#039;t deny a person in a stressful profession a vacation, no?<br /><br />Two, three months go by, and you get a PM from your man with a new PGP key. He now wants to change the payment regime - to a different exchange method that is just as arcane as Bitcoins, but hard to get up and running and its anonymity is unknown - but most of all he wants out of the BTC rat race and fluctuations. Can&#039;t blame him, but cant take the plunge into the other net currency, either....too...iffy. Also, our man wants the min buy to much larger than your old routine buys....again I get why, its a hassle to go through all the pain for these piddly orders....but......I aint gonna do that. New PGP, 3 month absence, use different non BTC exchange. Rarg......<br /><br />Then, my man decides to use BTC again. Lists normal amounts. Pms his buyers....all is well......or is it? We really never know our vendors, its a safety issue for us and them. <br /><br />QUESTION: Is this vendor the same person, how do I convince my gut that I can transact with my man.???? <br /><br />I have always liked this person - not knowing him of course, but the conduct of our trade has always been so civil and friendly. I am concerned that his SR identity might have been compromised.....by......I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I need help, I need his wares. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Just shows me why you need escrow and bitcoins...they protect you from just these kinds of doubts.&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#039;s an element of trust involved, but I&#039;ve only had one seller actually do me wrong, and he just didn&#039;t deliver what he said he would, and talked a bunch of us into going out of escrow...and, biggerenshit, he didn&#039;t deliver to us, and selectively delivered to a couple of vocal defenders, leaving the rest of us looking like, well, idiots.&nbsp; So periodiically I&#039;ll finalize early, but that&#039;s just cuz there&#039;s a vendor I totally trust, and if he disappeard, I could take the loss....but if I don&#039;t play by the rules, I can&#039;t come here and complain when it goes bad.<br /><br />Stay in escrow, use btc, and be friendly, but careful.
