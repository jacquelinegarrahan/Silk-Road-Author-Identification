				Bitcointalk.org had a scam where somebody was logging into high post, old abandoned accounts and was using them to secure loans. Maybe start #bitcoin-otc trust ratings system, ensure you are talking to the right person with GPG signatures....??

				I find that generally the more illiterate the person, the more untrustworthy they are.&nbsp; So you can add being careless in their grammar / spelling to the list.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean not understanding verb tenses - I mean using words like &quot;ur&quot; and &quot;i&quot;.&nbsp; Slang in general...

				I would think some sort of overall &quot;Credit rating&quot; system needs to be established with a whole bunch of criteria.&nbsp; If you are in this for the big leagues you could float one-off buy opportunities for vendors as a silent partner.&nbsp; But it&#039;s a risky, risky biz, cash lending.&nbsp; Especially when the debtor is a name on a screen.

				What about when poor junkie buyers hold your ratings and rep hostage? How do you deal with that? Im just going to pay this scumbag...He wants 5 coins and now we are negotiating at 2 to delete my bad review all because I didnt accept him in my loan program. Its impossible to start a name here.

				Honestly dont do it for anyone who isnt a reputable member. I just loaned 4 coins out yesterday. 1 of those will get paid back I believe, but the other guy already deleted his account.

				[*] Low post count + less than 1 month old account = low attachment to account = low incentive to pay back a BTC.<br /><br />[*] High post count + less than 2 weeks old account = someone on a mission = Likely to rob you.<br /><br />By saying this I don&#039;t necessarily think there is any sure fire way to know. IRL don&#039;t loansharks require some collateral, and have means to break bones etc?<br /><br />If you could find a way to take collateral from potential clients then you might have yourself a business.
