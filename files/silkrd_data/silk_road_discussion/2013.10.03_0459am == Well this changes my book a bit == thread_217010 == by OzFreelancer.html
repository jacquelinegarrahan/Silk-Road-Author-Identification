Two or THREE? If that&#039;s the case and this ONE DPR got busted doesn&#039;t that mean there might be TWO more out there who would know how to run the site and bring it back? I&#039;d ask you to contact them again if you could but for your own safety I think that&#039;s out of the question. But it would bring hope to all the destroyed souls on here today if DPR 1.0 came back to save the day. Good luck on your book anyways.

				It looks like safe-mail is down. I had a few responses in there, so if I haven&#039;t come back to you, please know that I appreciate anyone taking the time to contact me very much and I will respond to everyone. At least one message I was unable to decrypt for some reason (Error=0).&nbsp; Where are pine and Guru when you need them?!?&nbsp; ::) <br /><br />Again, really appreciate the responses.&nbsp; Please keep them coming. <br /><br />I&#039;m also doing a piece for The Age (Oz mainstream paper) about the effect of the SR closure on Australians, so if anyone has any great insights they&#039;d like to get across on that subject, please contact me by PM or email ASAP :) <br /><br />x Eiley<br /><br />EDIT: safe-mail is working again :)<br />
