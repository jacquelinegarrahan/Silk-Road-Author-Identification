				It&#039;s got to the point now where SR has to implement some changes designed to limit these throw away accounts, spam accounts and the dickheads who can&#039;t be bothered to look for answers to basic questions and would rather have someone else look for them. The longer this site allows things to continue as they are, the harder and more time consuming the clean up will be. Maybe new accounts requiring the need to answer a little questionnaire which has sets of constantly rotated questions that must be answered correctly to join. Eliminating newbies who aren&#039;t prepared to do what most of us had to do will be a major victory and reduce the number of pointless new threads, most topics having been raised on more than one occasion previously.. At least if they pass the entry test, you can be sure they have a basic understanding of how things work as opposed to no clue at all.&nbsp; :o

				+1. Many have suggested a Newbie forum like on Bitcoin Talk. There you need 5 posts and 4 hours logged in to post outside the Newbie forum, but we have a karma system here. Anybody with overall negative karma at the end of the trial period still couldn&#039;t post outside the Newbie forum until they got at least net zero karma, that way obvious trolls like joywind and DPRs Mom couldn&#039;t spam the rest of the forum.<br /><br />This has been suggested many times but I doubt it will ever happen.
