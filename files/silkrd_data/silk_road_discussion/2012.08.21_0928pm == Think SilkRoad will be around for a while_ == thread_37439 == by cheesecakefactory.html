				Does anyone else get paranoia that this site&#039;s just going to disappear?<br /><br />Every-time I log on I worry it just won&#039;t be there anymore. Does anyone else get that? I think it&#039;s because I&#039;m the only person who knows about it in my world, anyone else is on here and I know nothing about them. It&#039;s almost like a dream world, and it all seems too good to be true.<br /><br />What&#039;s the consensus, do people think it&#039;s here for the long term, or are my worries that it&#039;s going to disappear somewhat legitimate?<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear all your thoughts.<br /><br />CCF.

				Start adding your trusted vendors emails to your tormail (tormail.org). If SR went down--God forbid--I have email address for every product I regularly buy.

				I hope no one ever leaves any significant quantity of bitcoins in their wallet here for long at all. It would suck for SR to die but it probably won&#039;t happen for a long time. There are probably plans in place for new SR&#039;s anyways. It&#039;s like music piracy, once it started it can&#039;t be stopped..it just evolves and the marketplace adapts until society and laws eventually adapt.<br /><br />Sure you may lose your trusted vendor but in the grand scheme of things...I&#039;m sure there will be other options if that ever happens. Just minimize your risks and sure use tormail but of course it&#039;s possible eventually. Eventually probably being more like years though but yes eventually. By that time new options have arisen as there&#039;s nothing to prevent this from continuing and it doesn&#039;t seem TOR can be beat from everything I read.<br /><br />Eventually I think this will be a turning point that leads to a reform in drug policy. People want to get fucked up and always have. Our world is too global. People can be anonymous if they want now and we can make our own currencies. Big picture: how do you stop it? I would hate to see the road go of course...

				probably, but id never be sure, you must prepare for every eventuality such as it closing, so i wouldnt leave too much btc on hand.<br />however that being said the site might die, but the idea wont, its the idea thats powerfull here, another would spring up, im sure DPR is making a killing from it, so someone else might come along and muscle in on this.. i wouldntt bank on any laws being changed at this stage...

				@ChristyNugs, that seems mostly if the DNS for the main url is compromised. I think most ppl in this thread are talking about like LE raiding the physical location of the SR servers and packing them up. (ie. no more SR at all, at any address).<br /><br />Personally, if this did happen, I see copycats springing up, or BMR getting a lot more popular. The services will go on. I just fear the worst for the staff of this site if the unthinkable happens.

				I think that it is unlikely that SR will be closed down itself.<br /><br />I think that LE are more than likely going to do something to mess with the way SR functions, like getting rid of bitcoins altogether or spreading FUD of some sort.

				I hope SR is around for a long long long time, &quot;FUCK THE LAW&quot;, I have only been here for 3 weeks, and I have found SR a truly remarkable place, I have purchased bitcoin from SR and I have purchased drugs from SR, the people I have dealt with have been awesome intelligent business minded people selling good fucking quality produce, ya average street numb cunt wouldn&#039;t have a clue on here, I will gladly buy my drugs from here for the rest of my life!!!! Long live silk road! Even if anything did happen to the wonderful SR it would only reappear elsewhere, it&#039;s a bit like music and movie piracy, no matter how much these government types want this shit to end it just aint guna happen, not in this life anyway!!!!! <br /><br />Over and out peeps&#039;!<br /><br />Keep on enjoying ya walk down the silk road, I certainly will<br /><br />Drugfiend!!!!!!!

There needs to be a different approach in regards to drugs in society. They will always be there and if one thing is for certain, the current War on Drugs campaign has not worked and failed to make an impact. A different approach needs to be taken, such as in countries like The Netherlands where a more liberal stance is taken on drugs in society. :)
