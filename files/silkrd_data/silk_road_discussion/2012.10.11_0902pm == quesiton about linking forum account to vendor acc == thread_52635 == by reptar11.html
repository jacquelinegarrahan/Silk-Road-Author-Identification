				i dont know if this is the right forum to post this but<br /><br />i tried joining the vendor group on the forum a little over 2 weeks ago and it still says &quot;approval pending&quot;<br />and i havent gotten any messages from admin/mods on either SR or here about it.<br /><br />the main problem is a noticed some of my threads in the product offers sections are getting closed for &quot;not having a vendor account&quot; even tho ive had one for atleast 6months, i think longer.<br /><br />is there a way to speed up the approval pending part? i thought it might take a day or 2 but 2 weeks and no change.<br /><br />or is there someone i need to contact? any help is appreciated. sorry if this has been posted before

				Link your vendor account to your forum account.<br /><br />Strange how your title says this...yet you don&#039;t mention it at all in your entire post.<br /><br />If you do not know how to do that....you shouldn&#039;t be in the vendor only forums.

				thanks for the dick response bro. hope it made you cum yourself a little bit while you were snickering to yourself.<br /><br />so ill take it joining the vendor group is not the way to go about it? from the sound of your post thats basically what you said, cause i mentioned i did that and that it has said approval pending for over 2 weeks.<br /><br /><br />anyways apparently thats the wrong way to do it. so ill keep looking around when i have time

				It wasn&#039;t a dick response..It was a truthful one. Sorry your so sensitive..<br /><br />Here is a dick response...<br /><br />Hey dumbfuck...even though you made a title to a post and in the post never mentioned what the title was about in it once..I will still help you...In order to &quot;link&quot; your vendor account to your forum account, put the link to your vendor account on Silk Road in your signature. Like EVERY OTHER VENDOR.<br /><br />That&#039;s why your post have been deleted when you try and sell something. No one knows if your a vendor.<br /><br />Also I guess I am a lot nicer then everyone else since unlike everyone that just ignored you I actually tried to help you. So after weeks of no responses and months of getting your post locked you can see it was as simple as this to fix it. <br /><br />Your welcome you fucking moron.<br /><br />
