				I see lots of questions about being a vendor or what it takes to be a vendor. Hopefully I cover it here, if not I am sure some one will add to it or correct me!<br /><br />Fist and foremost, being a vendor is more than just slinging ounces of product. There is a lot to consider! You will need to know how to package your product, how to ship it, The in&#039;s and out&#039;s of PGP, as well as encrypted hard drives and bootable CD&#039;s/keys. You will need to know how to secure your system and protect your buyers and there information. How bitcoin works and how to withdraw bitcoin with out arousing suspicion. There is a lot to being a vendor.<br /><br />Most of the above information can be found on the board. This post is for the things that are not discussed as much.<br /><br />Packaging, If your product can be detected via a dog or electronic sniffer then you need to know how to package It is a requirement of being a vendor!<br /><br />Escrow, Every sale is escrow-ed. This means that when some one buys from you the money is held in SR&#039;s system and not released to you tell they release it or it auto-finalizes. Auto-finalization takes 17 days and you will have people buy then not come back and finalize the deal. If you can not float the money needed for 17 days you may not want to be a vendor.<br /><br />Requiring people to Finalize early (FE). You can&#039;t! As a new vendor you will not be allowed to require people to finalize early until you have completed 35 transactions and&nbsp; been a vendor for 1 month! On top of that, it is considered bad to require early finalization of the escrow you will loose customers over it and people will talk on the board.<br /><br />You are also not allowed to do any of the following!<br />Directing your customers to pay outside the escrow system or in currencies other than Bitcoin <br />Leaving fake feedback for yourself from a dummy buyer account <br />Threatening your customer, even if it is a veiled threat <br />Saving customer addresses <br />Claiming to have sent an order when you haven&#039;t <br /><br />Everything must ship with delivery conformation or some form of tracking and preferably one that does not require a signature. If you don&#039;t do this and some one claims they did not receive the package you will be unable to prove you shipped it and they will win the dispute and get a full refund of there money.<br /><br />Now lets get to what it costs, To create a vendor account you will need to create a standard account and then at the bottom of the account page will be a link to becoming a seller. It will cost you $150 USD to create the account. This is payable in bitcoin. If you do not have the $150 do not post on the board that it should be cheaper or start a thread suggesting that the cost be lowered or removed. Many of us feel the price is cheep! To put this into perspective, I used to run a web business on the clearnet and some places charged upwards of $200 a month for 1 banner ad. It was worth it there and it is worth the $150 for the account here!<br /><br /><br />On top of the $150 seller account fee, SR will take a commission on each sale you make. The commissions are currently as follows<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000&quot;<br /><br /><br />You may also want to note that there is the feedback system and the forums. Vendors who are doing a poor job will get bad feedback and that will hurt sales! People will also talk on the forum, which can lead to a bad rep and lower sales. On the flip side of that if you are a great vendor it will reflect in your feedback and people will talk on the forums leading to better sales. You really have to work balance it out, provide a good product at a good price, with good shipping and all in a timely manner. You have to manage your image on both SR and the forums.<br /><br />I have debated if I should add this or not but you really should know. There are buyers out there they try to scam vendors and new vendors are targets more than established ones. You will have people that do things like demand a refund or they will leave bad feedback, try to use something other than bitcoin to pay you with, attempt to get free samples on the promise of a big buy, etc, etc. How you handle them is your problem. However once you reach 55 sales of an illicit item you can request access to the Vendor section of the forum and then you will be able to see the list of problem buyers. ;)<br /><br />All in all there is a lot of work in being a vendor on SR. In no way is it a way to GET RICH QUICK but with work, good product, and good service you can make good money.

				Amen brotha James!<br /><br />I think a lot of people feel it is a get rich quick scheme. It is not. It doesn&#039;t mean that there isn&#039;t $ to be made. Once you are established, you are really only limited by the time you can dedicate to it. <br /><br />A few more notes and perspectives:<br /><br />1) Buy a vacuum sealer. Have one before you vend anything. It has really gotten to the point on SR (and rightly so in my opinion) that every sale is vacuum sealed. I can only think of a few exceptions (and circumstantially enough JamesLink2 vends some) that do not have a customer expectation of being vacuum sealed. No excuses &quot;I want to buy one, but I need to sell stuff first.&quot; Spend that money on one before your vendor account. Then save your $150 for a vendor account.<br /><br />2)Conduct yourself as a professional. that does not mean you need to be wearing a tie behind your computer to talk to clients. It does not mean that there is an implied &quot;you are too young&quot; Age plays into how people usually act, but maturity can over come it. This is not WoW. This is not a forum for your favorite &quot;indy&quot; rock band. You have other people trusting you. Be prepared to handle that trust responsibly and do not ever intentionally or blatantly squander it. It will come back to bite you, even if you get away with it once or twice. Other peoples safety and security are in your hands now. Be serious.<br /><br />3)Packaging: I have yet to see any vendor here tell a &quot;I-want-to-be-a-new-vendor&quot; guy exactly how to package. Most people recommend buying something off of an established vendor and see how they do it. Find a vendor with a bunch of good feedback,a vendor maybe vending the same thing you want to, and buy from them.&nbsp; <br />That is what I was told when I got here. I didn&#039;t do that because I had already acquired a level of stealth locally and I only had to figure out a few things (the USPS system mostly) to begin vending here. <br /><br />What I recommend (if you do not&nbsp; buy from an established vendor) is to &quot;practice&quot; your shipping. Sure you are going to have to spend a few more dollars. Mock up your shipping method. Decide &quot;how&quot; you are going to ship. First class, priority, express. whatever. Know what it is going to cost to ship via that method. Know what kind of supplies you are going to need. Packing tape, package labels, etc. Know where you are going to get them from. Are you going to mail first class and buy bubble wrap and brown boxes from Uline, or do you only want to send packages express (overnight mail) and then you get to use the free USPS envelopes and boxes. Send&nbsp; a couple package with &quot;inert&quot; contents via the method you are testing. Does it get there? If not, why not? What does the DCN say? You did use a DCN right? Next send a package or 2 with your real contents. Same deal. Did it get there? No?, why not? What does the DCN say?<br /><br />Package correctly. If I were to shake your package, does it rattle? Is one side strangely heavier then the other. Does it feel like there is nothing in there? Do the contents &quot;shift around&quot; if the package it tilted. Not all of these are bad things. You need to know which ones are.<br /><br />4)Package Tracking AKA - DCN (Delivery Confirmation Number) is a generic term for any number that will give you (the vendor) the peace of mind that your client got his box. Decide how you want to handle this. Do you ebay a lot of stuff? Do you want to walk in to a Post Office or do you want to just be able to drop your packages at a mailbox (blue box). What is the difference? How long will it take to get there (avg)?&nbsp; How can you make your item appear as &quot;usual&quot; as possible? <br /><br />Note: If you do not use some type of package tracking, then you leave yourself open to the customer saying he never got your letter, and you have no proof to indicate that he did. Then it is just a fight back and forth and usually the customer will end up getting money back, if not a 100% return. This is called &quot;protect yourself&quot;<br /><br />One example - The customer trend currently is to dislike handwritten labels as a whole. I agree with this, but can think of one instance where they may be better then a printed label. If you vend blotter paper art. (nothing illegal about that right?) You plan you simply use a plain white letter envelope. I could imagine a hand written label being fine. It will just look like correspondence. On the other hand. If you mail BIG BROWN BOXES, do not hand write &quot;XYZ International Global Head Quarters&quot; as your return address. This just doe not make sense and make you stand out.<br /><br />Most of this above here has been described simply as &quot;blend in&quot; And that in its purest sense is exactly what you want to do. Do you have any idea how many letters go through your closest major USPS hub in a day? Scratch that. Do you even know WHERE the closest major hub is located? Do all your letters go to that one hub, or do some go to hub A if they are going East and letters headed generally north or west go to hub B? Seriously. Know this shit.<br /><br />5)Vending: Ok you got all the above purchased and figured out. You just bought your vendor accnt and you posted on the forums and are ready to sell, but no one is buying. Why? They don&#039;t trust you. Why should they? Or better yet, how can you allow them to trust you? The usual, fastest and &quot;nicest&quot; (my opinion) way to do this is to give away samples! Yes you are going to have to spend MORE money. Hold a giveaway or sampler via your own terms. (must have X posts on the forum, must have X transaction on SR) whatever. This is also your last ditched attempt to work out any potential kinks in your shipping method. Consider it a trial run. Assuming you got everything nailed down to this point, your feedback and offer posts will come in and people will begin you believe that you are not just trying to steal their BTC. The balls starts rolling. Slowly. Once your reputation for being fair, fast and honest is out there, you will become busy.<br /><br />6)Being Busy: Do not take orders for something that is not directly in front of you. Its just bad business to float your numbers. Remember even if you are making a lot of sales a day (as Jame said) it could be 17days until you see those coins. Account for that. Do not make a 100 sales, when you only have 50 items and think &quot;I will just use the income from these first 50 to go buy 50 more and then fill the orders for the second fifty. More times then not this will not work. The first thing that will happen is your customer base will get upset. You will become &quot;jammed&quot; up very quickly. It doe not matter if you are charging for shipping or &quot;including it for free&quot;, have the funds to be able to post your packages. Again do not account for the BTC (in escrow or not) that you do not have in hand. Postage can become more of an additional out of pocket expense then one may realize. It was, even for me and I felt like I had a good handle on things. The avg price of a USPS Priority small flat rate box with DCN is $6.25. 10 sales and you need $62.50 in your pocket just to get your boxes out the door, and to the customer so that they can approve and finalize (at which point your coins come out of escrow and into your SR accnt)<br /><br />Even if orders are flying in, postage cost is covered and product is stocked. Think about the time it takes to prepare all those packages to be &quot;mail-ready&quot;. Again surprised myself here. It takes time. Even if you can do it all (beginning to end for one customer) in 3 minutes. 10 orders a day and you need a half hour. Some people do not even have an &quot;extra&quot; half hour in their day. Plus the time to mail them out. If you are &quot;blue box droppin&quot; (I think I just coined a term there) How many packages are you sending? Think it is &quot;usual&quot; for a PO carrier to open a blue box and find 67 packages from the same place in there? I&#039;ll answer that one for you. NO! Its not. Which means you either need to move around from blue box to blue box not on the same postal route - or the same PO carrier is going to unload them (and that is the only thing that looks MORE suspicious then dropping them all in one blue box.<br /><br />So. To recap this far:<br /><br />A) You got a vac packer<br />B) You are a professional<br />C) You Know how to package<br />D) You know how to track<br />E) You got yourself a vendor account and have worked out a plan to become established<br />F) You have budgeted the right amount of time/money and resources to setting AND maintaining your clients expectations<br /><br /><br />WHAT NOW?!<br /><br />Even if everything is going GREAT!!!! you have quit your full time job and you are now an independent business owner. You need to now account for getting &quot;burned out&quot; (not like that) Considering a decent percentage of vendors here are &quot;one man shows&quot; (even if you have a partner) sometimes your sales can come in so quickly that you can not find the time to process all the orders and dispatch them safely.<br /><br />TAKE A BREAK! Pull your listings. Post of the forum that you are currently overwhelmed (and honored) by every ones response to your listings that you have temporally pulled them in an effort to get your current orders processed. Assure your client base that everything is &quot;ok&quot; and you are not disappearing like a &quot;thief into the night&quot; Tell all the current order customers what your time line is (generally speaking of course on the forum) for their order.<br />In the beginning I did this out of a personal circumstance that arose. I then realized that that is how I prefer to handle my dealings&nbsp; here. <br /><br />1) 100 widgets received (to me)<br />2) listing for 50 widgets goes up.<br />3)listing is down to 10 widgets in 45minutes.<br />4)decide the maximum amount of effort you can put forth in the next 48 hours and divide by remaining widgets you want to list.<br />5)List that amount of widgets. (25 more)<br />6) After packaging a total of 60 widgets you realize that you only have enough postage for 5 more, not the 15 you have listed.<br />7)Change your listing down to 5 (65 total)<br />8 ) sold out! (but wait I still have 10 more that I &quot;could&quot; sell)<br />9) get all your current items out the door. SHIPPED.<br />10) get the postage you need for the last 10<br />11) List and repeat.<br /><br />...this is clearly just a suggestion. It is NOT how everyone does it. They do what they have found to work for them. This is an example of one way that could work for most.<br /><br />Point is, you can easily become overwhelmed, and that could easily become your point of failure. Even if everything above is inline, are you packaging to the best of your ability? or are you cutting corners to save time because you have 25 more to do before you can go home and go to bed? Are you going to go dump all those in 1 blue-box because &quot;fuck it I been at this for 14 hours today - im beat!&quot;. You risk not only your own security, but also that of 65 other people.<br /><br /><br />....There is more, but I have been typing this for over a hour now. :x<br />Hopefully this will help get some answers out there, with out saying to much of course.<br /><br />CURRENT VENDOR! - If you read to here (I&#039;d be amazed) and feel that I may have &quot;said too much&quot; on one topic or another, send me a PM and I&#039;ll reconsider my post. This post took so long as I tried to be as informative and yet non-specific as I could, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;ll re-read the whole thing at this point.<br />

				Hey guys, I noticed this thread and had some more input on selling on SR. Please keep in mind that as of yet I am not a vendor but I do have a lot of experience in sales and shipping illicit products through Canada.<br /><br />First in regards to sales, (as a buy I can speak about this with ease) Dont make your stuff sound like its better then it is!!! Be str8 up with people and they will reward you with the trust you need to build a good business relationship. Always Always Always make sure the weight is spot on, or even over if you can afford to do this. Doing this will ensure that your clients stay your clients and not go shopping somewhere else.<br /><br />your clients are the bread and butter of your operation,&nbsp; without clients where would you be?? In my experience if you treat your clients like gold you will surely rake in the gold. \<br /><br />Customer base: once you have built your customer base you might want to think about specials for your good customers.. for example..<br /><br />a custom listing for all clients who bought x amount in the last month <br /><br />give them the opportunity to buy now and score a great deal, not only will they love the idea but it gives you a chance to move any extra product you have lying around.<br /><br />Shipping: as a new seller you must know how shipping works.<br /><br />in my experience (shipping in canada for years) the best idea is to use multiple couriers<br /><br />fedex ups, purolator, dhl, among others... by shipping through these companies you can drop off your package at one of many little stores (check cashing, internet cafe, convince store ect) who offer shipping as well... try to stay away from actual shipping companies hubs.. find the little guys<br />&nbsp;and ship through them...... you can pick up any waybill (used for shipping) from these locations and as a matter of fact you can pick up many of each, doing this will allow you to fill out the waybill at your one place with gloves on of course..<br /><br />dropping of the package... use different locations and couriers.. it being so close to winter you can do all your packageing at home throw on some leather winter gloves (if the weather permits) drive down to ship your product drop the box or envelope on the table and dont touch it again.. take off your gloves and bada big bada boom your in business.....<br /><br />hope this info is helpful to some!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You guys are rocking this thread!<br />I have only a few suggestions/comments.<br /><br />Change up your shipping methods and drop off points often.<br /><br />Always wear gloves/hairnet when you&#039;re packaging or touching product.<br /><br />LE love to profile, and chances are they are going to order something from you to try to extract info about your packaging methods, location, and any personal biometrics from the package.&nbsp; Fingerprints, sweat, hair are all traceable.&nbsp; You may not have a criminal record, but you never know when you might be in an accident or accused of something, they fingerprint you and then see that you&#039;re the guy they&#039;ve been searching for.<br /><br />I would also recommend underestimating the quality of your product in your listings a bit, so when customers get it they will be blown away by their lowered expectations of your awesome kit.

I am honored that you found my info important enough to go and post it somewhere else.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I also I a few more things I wanted to mention that I left out before.<br /><br />As a seller you must know that a large portion of your potential clients out here have been scammed or ripped of by either full blown scammers or &quot;selective scammers&quot; as the seem to be called. Some clients might give you the 5th degree regarding shipping time, costs, qualties, questions and concerns prior to placing an order.... this is normal, people don&#039;t want to lose money especially people looking to get high off the net.<br /><br />understand this and work with the client. this whole business it not the same as the street corner business.. selling here is like owning any other legit company (minus the taxes plus the risk) you have to offer top notch customer service.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your listings. This is the first time a potential client will have any contact with you or your product. FIRST IMPRESSIONS MEAN EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Treat your listing as if it was its own little website just for you<br />make it nice, make it look good to the eyes, take proper pictures ( not a picture with some chick standing 5 feet away holding a 10 gram nug in her hand) make it clear what your offer is, what your policies are ect.. I would not recomend a listing as follows<br /><br />&quot; 20 G hydro weed<br />very nice and smells good too<br />check my buyer page for more info..&quot;<br /><br />fuckkk that.. PUT IT ALL IN YOUR AD! your faq... in the listing.... your shipping..... in the listing.... your policies.... in the listing.... your main page should be for your feedback and other items as I see it...<br /><br />I personally hate checking on an item and then having to sift through a messy page looking for an answer that shoulda been in the listing in the first place<br />&nbsp;<br />and remember if your ad is ugly you and your operation will seem ugly.<br /><br />well that&#039;s all for now, I&#039;m sure ill realize i missed something and add to this post at some time.<br /><br /><br />later

				You two bring up a good point.<br /><br />It is worth noting that any and all of my advice is for U.S. to U.S shipments only.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you are in the U.S and want to ship internationally I can not help and if you are in another country all together I can not help. <br /><br />While the ideas I have mentioned above could be generalized to still help, they had U.S. to U.S in mind when written.<br />

Suffice it to say everyone has their own way of doing things, and everyone has to weight their own &quot;risks&quot; or what they consider to be a &quot;risk&quot;<br /><br />No one is going to tell you X,Y,Z, how to do such a thing. You may get lucky enough to have someone speak to you privately, but in all honestly not as a forum user with 4 posts. Hopefully (for you) that name is just an alternate identity. <br /><br />Needless to say there is no one place where anyone can discuss such things safely without putting their own methods at risk.<br /><br />I personally have tried a few things in the past and none of them offer the security and anonymity that I prefer. <br /><br />I also don&#039;t feel that it is such a monumental task that I have to pay someone to teach me, but I am also just a small fish in a big pond. <br /><br />Methods (self-devised) have recently come to light. Testing has begun but for one reason or another progress is slower then I would like it to be. <br /><br />Point is I guess that this is the ONE thing that no one wants to talk about. I can&#039;t say I blame them. :\<br /><br />

How can you think using a shipping company is less anonymous then simply dropping an envelope in the MILLIONS of red mail boxes around any part of Canada??, all the ones I use have NO camera&#039;s anywhere near them and even if they did they would not be able to prove which envelope you just dropped in there. And if you want to ship express you simply walk into a post office (here I know of MANY with no camera&#039;s, and it really does not matter if their is a camera) and you pay cash for your express envelope and simply drop it into any red mailbox just like any other letter......Canada Express post is very fast and way cheaper than using a private company and guess what? They cannot open your mail! Also you need to think of your clients safety. What do you think is safer, something that is simply dropped into their mailbox by a mailman or actually SIGNING for the package like ALL private companies make you do?? The answer is obvious, having to SIGN ON DELIVERY IS A HUGE NO NO. If you need to ship very large quantities&nbsp; hey also have different size express envelopes and the largest one is massive! I am not trying to be offensive but if you want to sell here you have a lot of homework to do...... You need to figure out how to make your letter look and more importantly feel like the millions of other envelopes they process daily. I ship envelopes with hundreds of bulky pills in them, or a large quantity of hash or powder and all it looks and feels like is business reply mail. You need to find proper return address&#039;s to use and make your mail blend in. The amount of envelopes going through the post everyday is insane and envelopes are the least scrutinized piece of mail. I can fit thousands of dollars worth of any drug in an envelope that can just be dropped off in any mailbox, you just need to be somewhat creative with the way you package things and that&#039;s not something that I will elaborate more on a public forum about.....

				Excellent thread, required reading in my opinion.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just made the switch to being a vendor and even though my product is digital and of use to only a small subset of the SR community (i.e. other vendors, especially the ones processing lots of orders), there&#039;s still very useful information here.<br />

				Well, those lawyers you&#039;re talking about.. did you find them in the yellow pages might I ask???<br /><br />I have a corporate lawyer on retainer since 2007 he is always there when i need him&nbsp; for whatever. (incorporate a new company, fuck with the gov if they fuck with me, make sure any changes I make are within the law ect.)<br /><br />I also have a criminal lawyer on a retainer also since about 2007<br /><br />he takes care of any tickets, charges, bail hearings, wtv I need he too is always there...<br /><br />maybe I should have started this off by telling you that since i was 16 i had been in and out of some serious trouble,.. and as such have made contacts along the way...<br /><br />those contacts have protected my butt all kinds and hopefully will continue to do so.<br /><br />unless you know or are plugged in to the underworld it might be hard to find a GOOD lawyer you can keep in your back pckt... but none the less ask around.. i&#039;m sure you have some friends who have been in trouble.. talk to there lawyers and see what they say... i&#039;m sure if your worth it some lawyer will take you on a retainer, just gotta find the right one!<br /><br /><br /><br />also.. i have not been in trouble since 2006 so i guess keeping these guys one call away is working!<br /><br /><br />

				that sucks... If you know anyone who has done some real time they should be able to help you....<br /><br />lawyers are in it for one thing... the money!<br /><br />if you are a nobody (i&#039;m not saying you are) then most probably most lawyers will see it more as a waste of there time to take you on as a client, especially if the money is not right..<br /><br />if you&#039;re bigtime or deal with bigtime clients of theirs then there really should be no problem to get on a retainer...<br /><br />also... if you have not been in any serious trouble with the law before then really you dont need a lawyer on retainer....<br /><br />most people get off many charges with a slap on the wrist if its the first time. (there are some exceptions)<br /><br />&nbsp;if you really need a lawyer on retainer then you&#039;re gonna get one... just gotta decide if you really need it?!?!?

Why is it that no one will share the best, least costly, safest method to extract our cash from the system?&nbsp; I mean...

				I have a question it may be considered too personal, but I&#039;m not naming names or anything so I don&#039;t see the harm in it. I wanted to ask sellers about the addresses they use. My favorite shipping method as a buyer is when the dope comes in an envelope like mentioned earlier. &quot;I ship envelopes with hundreds of bulky pills in them, or a large quantity of hash or powder and all it looks and feels like is business reply mail.&quot; <br />Also what I&#039;ve noticed from some of my favorite sellers is that they have a business on the envelope. What I want to know from you sellers is about the businesses. I&#039;m sure they vary seller to seller, but are they completely imagined business and addresses. I might be paranoid, but I felt maybe after a period of time the post office might catch that the address doesn&#039;t exist, or is the address legitimate and randomly selected with a made up company name to go with it? Or do you borrow a real business and its address? <br />I would also like to know why y&#039;all feel it&#039;s sketch to talk about how to get your money back out of Silk Road while keeping your anonymity.

With a proper DCN, the burden of proof on your end (vendor) is covered.<br /><br />You make a good point though, worth discussing. Thanks.

				What I&#039;d like to add if it hasn&#039;t been covered (I&#039;ve took my contacts out so can&#039;t read so well) is setting aside a few hours, better if you can include some willing friends, and just create a huge amount of parcels ready to go.<br /><br />Me and 2 mates sat down and did a multitude of envelopes that now simply need the address and stamp adding - shitloads of 0.5/1/2/3.5s, and packaged them ready. Also to a lesser extent, some of the more rare orders, like the 10g.<br /><br />Now when I get a lot or orders, 90% of the job is already done.<br /><br />Doing this for a couple of hours every few weeks with mates means you aren&#039;t as pressed for time when it comes to processing orders.<br /><br />Also make sure to have the weights bagged up, so when you run out of packaged stuff, it&#039;s just a matter of repackaging.<br /><br />Just try find a workflow you&#039;re comfortable with, and doing it with mates helps reduce the load and makes the whole experience less daunting.

				Yes. I agree 100% <br /><br />Thanks for the example. Every vendor would need to find their own version of this, but you make a great point.<br /><br />&quot;The more you can do now - the less you have to do later&quot;<br /><br />It may not seem like a big deal, until you have 10-25-50-150 orders to fill in a day.

Very detailed one question though, I always thought tracking raised the chances of customs searches if packadges are crossing over from 1 country to the other. I.E Canada to USA or vice versa.<br /><br />I have email vended for along time ( since 2007 ) but as with all things times change &amp; the evolution of vending is here with SR. Obviously it is much safer and the next logical step in the black market online community.<br /><br />But my question still remains, Does a tracking # in anyway give customs the ability to pull a packadge &amp; search it ? I had always advertised we only use snail mail to avoid customs searches &amp; through all my years never had any issues. When I first started out &amp; used tracking the packadge never showed up. Everytime after that was always snail mail Unless it is staying within country.<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anybody who takes the time to answer this question !

				Great thread! I made it into the top 40% in 3 weeks and hope to keep up the good work soon. I think communication and respect are amongst the most important things for vendors. PGP is the only thing I have struggled with but am starting to learn more about now.

				Thanks for this post guys! it was really helpful. this is actually my first post and i am quite new here. i have browsed SR several times in the past year or so but finally took the plunge the other day and made my first order annnnnnnd it ends up being from eatmeupfrymeup who 24 hours later was already banned. did i finalize? oh course i did duh! lol ah well i didnt overly understand everything yet and went balls deep without fully understanding things like FE etc.. ah well i chalk it up to a learning experience and laugh it off (it was only like 150$ CDN anyway). but from there i learned alot about reps and NOT auto-finalizing lol, just the ropes basically. i also figure possibly i may be able to set up a vendor myself as i have access to a few things that people might be interested in. obviously i wouldnt want to be anything like that shit bag that ripped me off or anything but i would like to gain a good rep and be in good standing here, if i choose to try it out. this thread has answered so many questions and has actually made me more confident in this idea as well. i guess one of the missing pieces for me would be how best to convert bitcoins to canadian funds best without super high fees. i see you guys dont like talking about it alot and i completely understand, and understand im new here but could anyone at least blindfold me, spin me around, and point me in the right direction? lol<br /><br />thanks guys and hope to talk more! :D<br /><br />cHemo

				Thanks for this. I think the cost of opening a vendor account has gone up, last time I checked it was like $400. Adding some more detailed shipping method information to the op for various products may be helpful. Also information regarding shipping tools like vacuum sealers, bags, packaging, etc.

				Brilliant thread. The amount of time and effort put into the first few posts is really commendable.<br /><br />One quick question.<br />People bang on about DCN a lot (and rightly so), but as far as I know, here in the UK, the only way one can get confirmation on domestic deliveries is to have the receiver sign for it. Although this is not the case for UK &gt; International, as &quot;Airsure&quot; allows some level of tracking without a signature.<br /><br />Is there something I&#039;m missing? Would surely help with vendors who get scammed.

				I dont know about the UK but in the US when shipping internationally there is no tracking at all. You can however get a &quot;proof of mailing&quot; when you ship internationally. It lists the to address and the post office stamps it to show it was shipped on the given date. I asked support some time ago and they said they will accept it because it shows you upheld your end in shipping the product.<br /><br />NOTE: that is a service that requires you to go in person to the post office to get. Not the best solution but one that does work in a pinch.<br />

				Great thread that should be copied and have all the filler removed (posts without useful info) and then made a sticky.<br /><br />I&#039;d add:<br />Don&#039;t make labels with a color lazer printer (unless you know about the yellow dots that identify your printer and have a solution to that).<br />If you become known at the post office for mailing packages with company X as your return addresses, it will not be safe to mail for company Y and Z at that post office in the future without a heck of a good cover story or ...? (if a company X mailing gets returned to sender, you probably can&#039;t ship for them anymore).<br />Buying a shitload of stamps is a little unusual as most big mailers use online postage. That can get you noticed at the P.O.. Try to buy it somewhere else/spread the purchases around/...<br />Asking for tracking labels in the USA (especially if you have to argue with the staff to get them) is currently similar to buying unusual amounts of stamps. Try not to do both (at the same time, especially) at your local-area P. Offices.<br />Choose return addresses that sound like they might mail to distant locations.<br />Choose addresses that have a zipcode close to the place you are mailing from. Does not have to be the same zipcode as some might suggest, but, think about the issue and have it seem reasonable that those packages from that company or person would get mailed from there. I&#039;m tempted to ship a companies mail from the closest blue box to the company. Sometimes I think it is better to not be so close in case the mail people know people at that company/get mail from them that looks different.<br />I do think real return addresses need to be used as I think address scanning could be used at times on the return address to see if it is real. I also think that they might check that first if they are thinking about being suspicious about a package. I may be too paranoid about that?<br />MBB&#039;s appear to be god&#039;s gift to SR. Vacuum is good for some reasons, but, don&#039;t assume it keeps in smells. Read the shipping and security threads a lot, especially if you don&#039;t know what an MBB is :-)<br />If you get a message asking for your Pin#, some Btc, for you to go to a webpage to receive treasure or the recognition you deserve, offering you a chance to try the new SR2 beta site, asking for your help to catch a scammer, asking you to help them make a video, ... You might as well go along with their idea if they seem legit because they have a name like: SR Supp0rt, SR Staff Invite Dep&#039;t, Scammer Capture Team, Honest Abe, Forum Mod Astor, Dread Pirate Admin Account, Official Vendor Alerts, &lt;Your mothers name&gt;, ...<br /><br />And lastly (although, even that is probably not true since I never seem to stop rambling on), Don&#039;t believe everything you read in this or any thread. Think about this stuff and about every step in your process. :-) NWN :-)

				My 2 Pennies .<br /><br />Take a professional view on things . <br /><br />Product :- Price it correctly , you can sell less than Grade A gear but don&#039;t think people won&#039;t know and not call you on it . Turning a profit is OK , lying and miss selling is not .<br /><br />Packaging :- There is ABSOLUTELY no excuse for fucking up on this one . It has to blend in with the local mail . Invest in a label printer , buy some office type stationary and most importantly some Mylar/MMB foil/bags to seal and send your stuff in .<br /><br />Postage :- Promptly , at the first opportunity . However , with all the best intentions things sometimes go wrong ( no, believe me , they will ) . Keep your customers informed and give them options . &quot; sorry this happened&nbsp; but I can do this or if that&#039;s not ok&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to cancel &quot; . Most people are understanding and will wait but for those that can&#039;t , they&#039;ll be happy you gave them an out and won&#039;t drag your budding reputation through the mud .<br /><br />Escrow :- Stay in it , don&#039;t ask for FE . If you can&#039;t manage your finances to keep cash flow going then pull you listings and regroup . Getting greedy for wealth , fame , status is ok but if you miss manage it it can go very wrong very quickly .<br /><br />Messaging/Customer service :- Be polite . Yes you&#039;ll get a lot of Pm&#039;s that if ppl took the time to read your listings/profile they wouldn&#039;t ask but you wanted to work in a customer based service industry so deal with it .<br /><br />Security :- You have no friends here . Don&#039;t get blaise . Gloves for everything , don&#039;t lick that envelope , blend in with the crowd .<br /><br />Education Education Education ( I sound like Tony Blair ) :- Educate . assimilate and evolve ( now I sound like the Borg ) this genie is well and truly out of its bottle but the forces that oppose our way of thinking / life are also changing so keep up to date .<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Thanks for this!<br /><br />I am used to working in an office so would be good at most of the skillsets needed.<br /><br />I wonder how many female vendors we have on here.<br /><br />Of course you&#039;d need to sell something, plus with already having a job I don&#039;t think it would be a good idea!<br /><br />I like to work normal hours.<br /><br />But I would be very good at simply sending out something class C or B, not sure what benzos are but I could get those prety cheap I guess.<br /><br />I think I would sooner just be a buyer&nbsp; :)

				I actually do have one question about something I don&#039;t believe was addressed here-<br />What about outsource vending?<br />Say I have a factory connection where I could make a profit with competitive prices, but the supply is held elsewhere?&nbsp; I&#039;d be willing to rectify mistakes, though there has never been any with this source.&nbsp; I&#039;d also have a domestic source of something or other which would be handled directly by myself.<br /><br />I&#039;ve wanted to start up for a while now, but don&#039;t know where to begin or if it&#039;s recommended.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same basic principle applied by drgonzo and a few other vendors, but I could match or beat a lot of those prices.<br /><br />Feedback appreciated ^.^

				This has almost become an unofficial sticky. Outsource vending is actually not that uncommon on Silk Road, so it&#039;s not un-doable.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
