				Title says it all. Is there a likelyhood of buyers who didn&#039;t use PGP and have a order processing to get raided?<br /><br /><br />How long do you think these raids would take to execute, if they do them at all? How long should one lay low?

				In the FBI document there was no mention of the servers being taken over, though they at least know the location of at least one silk road server. Presuming the site hadn&#039;t been compromised before being taken down, and the silk road operators were telling the truth when they said the address isn&#039;t kept once it has been used by a vendor, then only addresses submitted around the time of the server image (23rd July) would have been available to LE.<br /><br />There are a lot of unknowns, for sure, but you aren&#039;t necessarily compromised. It&#039;s impossible to know at this point.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about how such raids work, but I&#039;d guess if they were executed they&#039;d be synchronized as much as possible to avoid alerting people ahead of their raid. So lay low until you hear about them. But someone else can probably speak to that side better than me.

				I mean they obviously have access to the current server, that&#039;s no question... that&#039;s what I was asking about.

				When a vendor marks item as in transit the address is deleted, but they had access to SilkRoad servers since July so don&#039;t think it really matters. Don&#039;t think they&#039;ll come after small buyers but who knows what they&#039;re capable of. As long as you don&#039;t have anything on you, everything should be alright.
