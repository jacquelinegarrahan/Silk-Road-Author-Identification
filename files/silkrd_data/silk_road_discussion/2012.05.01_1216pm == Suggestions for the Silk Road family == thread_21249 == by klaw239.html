				Hello all. First let me say please excuse my poor grammar&nbsp; as I know it is not up to par but with that said I want to say I am new here and have only 3 transactions thus far. I have spent the past few hrs reading post about scams from this person or that person and I had to scratch my head! (up all morning&nbsp; anticipating&nbsp; a delivery Am I the only one who cant sleep cause they are excited and anxious when they expect a order??)&nbsp; First I refer to us all as a family&nbsp; (at least those of us with honorable and honest intentions being here) because we&nbsp; all are here for the same reason I would think and I am willing to bet&nbsp; 99% of us are good&nbsp; decent human beings.&nbsp; Let us all take a second to look around us and see what we have in front of us. It is so easy to lose respect and or appreciation for something when it is always within arms length like this is for us&nbsp; so how about we all before we log on to this utopia each day or as we are logging on&nbsp; lets take a second to say thanks for the silk road and those whop allow&nbsp; it to be here for us and last but not least the good&nbsp; venders who make so many of our lives happier each day by being here with the products we need/want. <br /><br />Lets try and keep it all in retrospect. I have only been here a few weeks and already fear losing it&nbsp; to some&nbsp; evil Government so as is my usual practice I am staying humble and always thankful&nbsp; &nbsp;for the things&nbsp; and the people in my life that make it just a little bit more tolerable and happier. Thank you silk road and&nbsp; THANK YOU to all you honest venders out there. You really do make a difference in many of our lives.&nbsp; Many of us suffer depression or ADHD or ANXIETY or panic attacks and your products allow us to have a better life so again THANK YOU. This is one family member who will never take this place or you guys/gals for granted. <br /><br />As far as the scams go. Escrow is there for a reason and no matter a venders rating Escrow is there for protection. Just cause a person has never wrecked a car would you let them take your new mustang out for a drive all weekend without&nbsp; him being insured? Same concept for your orders with escrow.&nbsp; No good vender will hold it against you for practicing a policy that siilk road&nbsp; has in place for a reason. I hate to&nbsp; see anyone get ripped off and lied to or taken advantage of but many of us at times bring it on ourselves cause we are too trusting in others. I have done that many times in my life too in the real world and it sucks we can&#039;t have absolute trust in someone&nbsp; but the truth is&nbsp; tat vender may not&nbsp; be ripping you off. He may be in the hospital or locked up or heaven forbid died and you are out your money. <br /><br />So lets just be thankful for what we have here and for each other and use some common sense when ordering.&nbsp; Thanks for any and all who read through this garbled mess. I am DrDoom74 on the road by the way.&nbsp; Take care everyone. Hope my package gets here this morning. ;o)

				We are all supporting organized crime.&nbsp; Most likely with a &#039;respectable&#039; big corporate front.<br /><br />DPR is not some benevolant hippy creating a community.&nbsp; It is a large scale operation here to make money.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy with that because I get very good drugs at very reasonable prices.<br /><br />It makes me laugh and a little bit sad to see people honestly thinking they have some sort of woodstock here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Except you are supporting that which you probably claim to hate.&nbsp; Enjoy your drugs.&nbsp; But don&#039;t fool yourself.

I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s even possible to BE a community where everyone is necessarily anonymous. No doubt there are cartels behind some, if not many, of the wondrous items for sale here and it&#039;s nice to think of everyone here as a family because we&#039;re all a bunch of druggies, which does give us common cause against any government, organization or agency who&#039;s mission it is to thwart our desires. But don&#039;t kid yourself, other than that,this is as much of a community as Amazon shoppers.

				I have an idea. I think silkroad should became a bit more corporate/organized, I mean have a few sellers in every country that supply people in that country with products. There is obviously a lot of problems there in that you have to get it from abroad into that country to the local supplier, but if you could do it in large amounts they could send out the small amounts to people in that country that order, it would be much safer for the buyer as the post wont have to go through international customs.<br /><br />Id like to hear what ye have to say about that and I&#039;m looking forward to hearing all the problems and faults. It is a far fetched idea but maybe this can give someone another idea that is better and might just work.<br /><br />Silkroad is a great community and its a pleasure becoming part of it. Its full of interesting people and stories. Hope your package came klaw239
