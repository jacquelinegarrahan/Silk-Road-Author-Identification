				This recently happened to me as well. I ordered a package from a vendor I trust, although it appears the delivery is simply lost in the mail (almost 3 weeks in domestic transit). <br /><br />We agreed on a resend of half the original order. It sucks to take a loss but at least this way we both eat half and can continue doing business. I like his stuff too so hopefully that was just a one-off.

I don&#039;t know what country you are in, but in the US, the postal workers will just take the package to your front door if it is too large.<br /><br />But then, it could be the vendor trying to scam you. Let&#039;s say that your package never arrives and there is no DCN, so he suggests that as the reason?<br /><br />We don&#039;t have enough information. Either one could be a scammer or neither of you could be scamming.<br /><br />But if it&#039;s legit, then yeah, 50/50 is fair. Can&#039;t really do anything about a retarded postal worker, after all. I&#039;m still in the &quot;someone is a scammer&quot; camp, though.

				So no card left about collection/redelivery? This just doesn&#039;t happen, they card you and then after a time it may be returned to the sender.<br /><br />If this is the truth then you would be lucky to get any sort of a refund. The seller has done their part. With a legal order you&#039;d have a right to a full refund but in that situation they would have a real return address on the package so it wouldn&#039;t have been lost.

I forgot about that part. Unfortunately, we don&#039;t know which one is the scammer. OP hasn&#039;t revealed enough details for the unbiased third party(ie, all us people commenting) to figure that part out.<br /><br />So, OP, did the vendor give you a DCN? Does the vendor even use DCNs? Did the package no show up, then you asked the vendor and he suggested the package was too large and must have been sent back? These are crucial questions into determining if you got scammed or if you&#039;re trying to scam him.<br /><br />Right now, though? I think something smells scammy.

				First time I hear that the package is returned after not fitting into mailbox. Here (and everywhere else I know) the mailman just takes it back to post office and leaves a note so the receiver can pick it up there

				I have to agree with everyone else...are you located in the U.S? If USPS can&#039;t fit the package into your mailbox they will either leave it at your door or they will leave a note for you to come pick it up. I&#039;ve had plenty of boxes that haven&#039;t fit in my mailbox and on some days I&#039;ve had 4 or 5 packages all delivered at once and they were left at my doorstep. At my old apartment, the mailman attempted to deliver a box that was to big to fit in the apartment boxes so I received a noticed letting me know that I could come to the local post office to pick it up.<br /><br />If the vendor can provide a DCN and prove he shipped the package and a delivery was attempted, he did his part...maybe if he&#039;s nice he could give you a small refund but otherwise he shouldn&#039;t have to take the hit on this if he really did ship it.

				i totally agree something doesnt seem right about this story - how did you figure out that is what happened anyway?<br /><br />i have never heard of anything like that occurring anywhere. its their job to deliver and its pretty common to receive mail that doesnt fit so they have methods to handle the situation rather than just wasting effort returning to sender... which costs the post money. i agree they would leave it at your door, or with a notice to pick up at the post, or even at the office to pick up if you live in apts, dorm, or have the mailbox at a private store <br /><br />imo i dont really see how its the vendors fault and why he should have to pay for the error, unless he shipped in a different manner than you had agreed upon or he something. if you assumed he would be using one method but didnt ask then its kinda your fault. if your statement is accurate, then he followed through with everything that is expected of a vendor. its like using an abandoned house or the wrong name... its your responsibility to make sure the package can be delivered with the address you give.&nbsp; all vendors use a false return address for their security, so its not his fault the package was lost. <br /><br />maybe the vendor could be really nice and do a partial refund like 25%, but something like throwing in extra on your next order if you can arrange for a package that will fit is more reasonable then expecting him to refund even half your money and especially not all of it. now if its the vendor who claimed thats what happened then its a different situation and sounds like an excuse for not shipping - in which case you would be entitled to a full refund <br /><br />edit: i know i just restated a lot of the last few posts but i had started typing before they were posted and didnt want to waste all my effort :)<br /><br />i agree BR it seems like someones using this as an excuse rather than it actually occurring

I would love to see the actual statistics of how many kids/teens are on SR&nbsp; :).<br /><br />Sorry OP, not trying to get on your case but you did leave a lot of details out of your original message so all of us can only go by the details you did provide and right now it looks like the vendor is not at fault and shouldn&#039;t have to provide you with a refund unless he decides to be nice and offer you 10% or 25%.

				Funny how many of you assumed I was trying to scam him.&nbsp; Anyways,&nbsp; the DCN indicated it was &quot;undeliverable as addressed&quot;&nbsp; I was confused and assumed either I or the vendor gave the wrong address.&nbsp; The next day I saw the mailman and asked if he had any idea what that meant.&nbsp; He said he remembered the day before he couldn&#039;t fit it in the mailbox and the way the apartments are that was his best course of action.&nbsp; Anyways, the apartments have about a half mile driveway and there is only about 10 of them and none of them are labeled.&nbsp; <br /><br />The vendor was unable to recover it because he didn&#039;t put his real return address on it.&nbsp; Anyways, the substance was uncontrolled and he was more than happy to give me a 50% refund.&nbsp; Actually I asked for it and he transferred the bitcoins immediately and just asked that I still gave him a 5/5 to protect both our ratings.&nbsp; I gladly obliged and all was well.
