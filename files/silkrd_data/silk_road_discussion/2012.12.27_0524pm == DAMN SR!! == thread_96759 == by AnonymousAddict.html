				I&#039;m in the same boat. I&#039;ve got a few things to do, and I think I may be getting screwed by a vendor (who I want to message in hopes of sorting shit out) and all I&#039;m getting is &quot;problem loading page.&quot; I love SR, but this shit is getting seriously old. <br /><br />And now the forums are giving me shit, too. Fantastic.<br /><br />On a related note, who else thinks we need a stickied thread for venting our SR-related frustrations?

When DPR would says I dont wanna work here anymore and sit down with his millions off on an island .... then we would all look stupid ;)<br />so dont complain so much on that..because DPR i still behind to fix it i guess ;)<br />Have a nice evening,<br />peace<br />

				Not working for me either. Haven&#039;t been able to get on since yesterday. I think it&#039;s just the insane amount of traffic with all the people that got money for xmas clamoring to buy drugs haha. I was able to get on once or twice very late at night (EST) this week and everything was lightning fast! I&#039;m currently trying to communicate with a vendor as well who can&#039;t get his shit straight on PGP. Guess I&#039;ll have to buy my new year&#039;s party favors locally and risk getting fake shit :/

				yes I think heavy traffic, 3 or 4 hours ago I was on fine and it was fast, the time it goes slow is the evening in europe, people getting in from work or college and logging on, and also people getting up in america and logging on, it&#039;s just the main peak time. this must really be a pain in the arse for american vendors.

That&#039;s when all of Europe is out of bed, doing things, and on SR!!!<br /><br />So timing is one thing. Figure, day after Christmas, a lot of us were going nuts because of that &quot;one less&quot; mail delivery day. I got one of the three orders I&#039;ve been whining about for the past week. Evilution (good speed).&nbsp; So what did I do right after that? - OF COURSE! Go on SR to leave feedback!! I&#039;m so happy!!!&nbsp; - Then as the sun rises on the western US, the same scenario happens.

(2:00am UTC) it peaks from 10p to 12a EST, That&#039;s because its anywhere from 3am to 6am in places like Germany, NL, France, England, etc. - I usually stay up all night, and around 3am NY time,&nbsp; it starts to get slow for me. That&#039;s when all of Europe is out of bed, doing things, and on SR!!!<br /><br />So timing is one thing. Figure, day after Christmas, a lot of us were going nuts because of that &quot;one less&quot; mail delivery day. I got one of the three orders I&#039;ve been whining about for the past week. Evilution (good speed).&nbsp; So what did I do right after that? - OF COURSE! Go on SR to leave feedback!! I&#039;m so happy!!!&nbsp; - Then as the sun rises on the western US, the same scenario happens. OR someone got disappointed again so they logged on to see, &quot;when was that shipped again&quot;.<br /><br />Right AnonymousAddict????? - Hey man! Did you ever get your benzos???- <br /><br />- Peace- jagfug. <br /><br />PS. If you&#039;re interested. Here&#039;s a link to that program. I think it was $29.&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.winzip.com/win/en/index.htm Good Luck!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nope Jaugfug still no benzos!!!&nbsp; I dont know whats up, Iv msg him and all he says is had to be because of christmas its well over 15 days now..

				Good lord... I swear, people, this really is the truth: you could have a million dollar behemoth of a computer that&#039;s so fast it could crack all of our PGP encrypted addresses by brute force in a matter of minutes, and it still wouldn&#039;t load Silk Road any faster than a barely-still-working Pentium 1 from the 1990s.<br /><br />Tor hidden services (that&#039;s what Silk Road is) aren&#039;t as easy to interact with as typical sites.&nbsp; You connect to several different computers in order to get to Silk Road.&nbsp; If any of the links between you and the site are slow, Silk Road is going to appear that slow.&nbsp; You literally are probably bouncing your connection through Germany, India, Switzerland, and God knows where else on the way to Silk Road.&nbsp; Making sure you can actually connect to Silk Road, while still making sure nobody can actually find the damn thing, isn&#039;t all that simple to accomplish.&nbsp; Think about it -- there has to be essentially no way to find the server, but your connection still has to find the server to connect to it.&nbsp; I mean it&#039;s amazing it works at all.<br /><br />It could be loading instantly for me and be slow as molasses for you because you&#039;re in a different location and your Tor program chose a different path to get to SR.&nbsp; That&#039;s not *always* why it&#039;s slow or unstable, but it is frequently.&nbsp; That means the server could be just as fast as all of Google&#039;s put together, and it may not make any difference at all.

Are you sure you&#039;re on Silk Road and not a phising site or something? (You&#039;re not playing Tetris?)
