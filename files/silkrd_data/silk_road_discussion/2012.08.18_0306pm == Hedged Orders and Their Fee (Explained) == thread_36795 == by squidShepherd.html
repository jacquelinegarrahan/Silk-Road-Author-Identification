				I&#039;m sure any of you who&#039;ve had a hedged order cancelled were surprised (or at least annoyed) to find that some of the dollar value was missing. This is widely attributed to a basic fee for hedging, but this is rather misleading and perhaps makes SR appear just a little greedy, pouncing on 4% the moment you place an order.<br /><br />When you place a hedged order, the thing you must recognize is that your BTC must be virtually converted to USD for your escrow to be stable in terms of USD. Of course, since they&#039;re not actually converted, when the order is closed the virtual USD must be converted back to BTC.<br /><br />If you perform this conversion anywhere else, you will naturally lose the bid-ask spread, and you will not be surprised nor particularly annoyed, because that&#039;s just how it works.<br /><br />And that&#039;s all that&#039;s happening here.<br /><br /><br />Thank you to Neuro for coming up with the logical reason for losing that spread instantly!<br /><br />If a vendor puts up a listing for $10, pegged to the USD and hedged, they are intending to receive $10 minus commission.<br />If a buyer places an order for that listing when the BTC is worth $2, they put 5 BTC in escrow.<br />Now imagine the vendor is on the next day and the BTC has plummeted to $1.<br />As things are, the vendor has 10 BTC minus commission in escrow. This is good.<br />If the virtual conversion took place after shipping, the vendor would be receiving $5 minus commission. That&#039;s a broken system.

				I understand that. I just think that cancelled orders should be returned as if they were unhedged. It&#039;s unfair for SR to take a loss or gain when no transaction takes place. If you never actually had a transaction take place then you should just get your BTC back.

				We&#039;re hoping that the BTC:USD ratio increases. That way we end up with more BTC for our sales. Also, the 4% fee is pretty hefty.<br /><br />So basically we can take a guaranteed 96% of our sale price or just risk it. Generally BTC has been going up so the chances are if you go unhedged you will get higher than 100%.

				So let me get this straight:<br /><br />Hedged = price of item locked to USD until finalization. 4% fee to vendor. Beneficial to vendor if USD:BTC ratio drops more than 4% from order processing to finalization.<br /><br />Non-hedged = price of item locked to BTC. No fee to vendor. No fee to vendor. Beneficial to vendor is USD:BTC ratio stays the same or rises from order processing to finalization.<br /><br />Is this correct?

				Well, when I started here vending, btc = $30 each.&nbsp; Lets just say a couple days after I sold (no hedge available) the price was at $15 each.&nbsp; I lost easily 50% on more than a handful of orders in one month, that was great. :)<br /><br />But yes, I currently do not hedge, although I was thinking about it at 15, now not so much back at 11.&nbsp; In a BTC uptrend it isn&#039;t that smart to hedge because you could potentially lose out on a lot.&nbsp; But you could also lose if BTC goes the other way.&nbsp; For anyone that has been in bitcoins for greater than 1 year will understand this.&nbsp; <br /><br />It also depends on what the final sale price is.&nbsp; I would leave my $50 orders unhedged, but I might think twice before I leave a $5000 order unhedged.

				So if a person makes an order for a hedged item for 10btc then 0.40btc goes to SR for the hedge instantly. At this time 10usd = 1 btc. Three days later the order is cancelled and the value of bitcoins has fallen to 1usd = 1btc. The buyer gets back 9.60btc. Is this correct?

				Hedged means USD<br /><br />Unhedged means BTC<br /><br />Let&#039;s say 1 BTC=$10 USD<br /><br />Order $40 item @ $10 per BTC. <br />Hedge in USD, pay 4 BTC.&nbsp; <br />Price goes down to $5 per BTC at time of finalization <br />seller still gets their $40, which equals 8 BTC now.&nbsp; <br />Silk Road recoupes losses and pays out the 8BTC -4% fees.
