				SR has the bond already. It will credit to your account when you request it via the appropriate method. What you do with the coin the the acct in the meantime is up to you. Restock and prosper.

				You don&#039;t have to keep Btc on your vendor account, but you need a certain number of transactions amounting to x amount of $ I think before you can get the bond back. I don&#039;t remember the details, but the detailed info is available somewhere (vendor Guide or WIKI or...). BTW, if Btc change in value while you wait, you get all of them back and can make or lose a lot of $ on the bond refund. Hopefully, make a lot on a coin rise :-).

It&#039;s 6 weeks, 35 successful transactions and at least $1500 in sales. You also get the exact amount of coins you put in for the bond back. So, if you paid 10 coins, it doesn&#039;t matter if coins are now worth $1 or $5000, you still get 10 coins back. <br /><br /><br />As for the money in your account, that is your money, do as you wish.
