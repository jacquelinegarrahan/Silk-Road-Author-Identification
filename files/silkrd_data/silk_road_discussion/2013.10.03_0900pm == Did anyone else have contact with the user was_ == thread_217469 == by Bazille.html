				He tried to convince me to do illegal things (hacking). We had contact for 2 weeks or so. Until I hinted that I won&#039;t do anything to steal anyones money.<br />First he was like &quot;I&#039;m a drug seller&quot;, later he was like &quot;I want to change my business, want to do some hackings for me?&quot;<br /><br />Might have been some&nbsp; FBI agent claiming to be Austrian, or some Austrian cop trying to convince a German to commit crimes.<br />When it was clear that I only do stuff for free to help people he stopped contacting me, despite me offering him advice for his future criminal activities if he tells me his agenda. I was curious what he had in mind, but he never told me. <br /><br />I assume that could mean they don&#039;t like people who offer help to the Silk Road community for free, and they wanted to get rid of me. Good good. Let the butthurt flow through you. I see that as a compliment.<br /><br />Or maybe that&#039;s just my imagination. Then you can let the butthurt flow through you anyway, suckers.
