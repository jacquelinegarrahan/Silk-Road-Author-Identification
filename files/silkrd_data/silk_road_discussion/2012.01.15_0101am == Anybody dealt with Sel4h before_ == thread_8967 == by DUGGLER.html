				Hi there,<br /><br />I bought some off this guy a little while ago and am still waiting on the package.&nbsp; Normally I&#039;d just shut up and be patient but the product was rare and I&#039;ve only seen it on SR once before in the past three or four months.&nbsp; Anyone buy from this guy/can testify to trustworthiness? <br /><br />Thanks

				Not a lot out there on this seller unfortunately mate, there&#039;s this thread here:<br /><br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2946<br /><br />the conclusion seems to be that he takes ages to ship stuff out, how long has it been since you ordered?

				The rumor mill would be a better place to put this. But the only thing I could find is he is a bit slow on shipping. Have you tried to contact him?

				I bought some from him, too, and I&#039;ve been waiting a while myself, too. I&#039;m going to give it another week or so, yet, before contacting him about it.

				Hey all, thanks for the feedback - I&#039;ll put this in Rumor Mill from now on.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be sure to update this thread when I get my order - shit, for real mescaline, I&#039;ll wait till next year.

				I did. It took the package a long 22 days to get to the US East Coast, but the product was perfect, as clean and potent as it gets for an extracted mesc. Very fine, off-white powder. For my trouble the seller promised a 25% discount off my next purchase.<br /><br />Communication - 10/5<br />Delivery time - 3/5 (not the seller&#039;s fault)<br />Packaging - 5/5<br />Product - 5/5<br /><br />Overall - 5/5
