				Ive been curious about how many users there are, access it daily, join each day, etc id like stats like that but idk if its possible to find that info or even if its out there if DPR and co would ever release it. <br /><br />Also what doesn&#039;t kill us makes us stronger, perfect example is DDoS attacks from a month ago.

				I think SR is much stronger than ever. The DOS attacks have helped most of us come together as a community on the forums, and has helped DPR see the week spots on SR and correct them to make the site stronger and less likely to go down. What ever takes us down can only make us stronger.

				Overall this site gets better as the months have gone by, the user interface now compared to when I started is 10x better, the search function works more smoothly and it seems like it&#039;s been forever since I&#039;ve had a transaction go bad. Have faith in DPR, just read a little more into the man and you will learn to trust him.

				Yup feels like SR is getting better. I think we should all thank that pos that took down the site for a few days since that person actually helped DPR to make SR site more resistant against future attacks. Thank you moralizer!

				SR maybe getting stronger against DDoS attacks, and we may be getting stronger as a community here, however the amount of new vendors doing a runner and account compromised due to user negligence or lack of knowledge is also on the increase, I could be wrong, however I am just going by what I have noticed, in the last few weeks.<br /><br />Since a lot of account are being compromised, although not SR fault, I believe as a community awareness must be raised against phishing, better security against keylogging and other potential situations. I stress again, that users must be more vigilant and prone to the new methods and tactics brought forward by the unjust!
