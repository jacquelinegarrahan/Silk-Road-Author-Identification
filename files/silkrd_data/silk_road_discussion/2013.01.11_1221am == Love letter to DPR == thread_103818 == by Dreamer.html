				Hello everybody. As you see, this is my first post here, however I&#039;ve been lurking around the forums and using the SR for almost a year now. I&#039;m relatively young (let&#039;s say between 18 and 28) and what I do is something almost everyone would consider respectable, intellectual, and constructive. I&#039;m not a major player here in any way, however I enjoy the wonderful possibilities here and they have given me many pleasurable nights with my friends. In the beginning, I found it kind of scary to order (and even to lurk this site) because of, well, the law, but in my last order, it was mainly the seller I was worried about. Bad move, since that order concluded in a little stamped letter from the authorities.<br /><br />Of course I was scared shitless, but really, it was a minor order and I knew they couldn&#039;t get me (furthermore, if they did, the max penalty would probably be nothing but a fine). So I ignored the letter. For now, I haven&#039;t heard more about it (and doubt I ever will, since it&#039;s been quite a while), but it&#039;s kind of made me think. I got really scared, and I mean REALLY. I remember reading crime and punishment, finding that I recognized myself in all aspects of Raskolnikovs behaviour (for you who haven&#039;t read it, the book&#039;s about a man who kills an old evil pawnbroker, and how he later is affected mentally), from being on the verge of confessing just like that, to forgetting vital obvious steps in concealing traces. <br /><br />Anyway, during this condition, one day I just woke up and realized that all of this was nothing but pure and sheer madness. I imagined an officer knocking at the door, and he looked so small. Sure, most of them are probably bigger than me physically, but in mind...? A pawn, following his &quot;laws &quot; blindly? Not following his own conclusions based on sound reasonin? A being full of fear, full of fear of being hurt, of being wrong, of &quot;doing the wrong thing&quot;... A pitiful being, not living for himself and what he loves.<br /><br />He would come to pick me in for some kind of interrogation, maybe accusing me of having ordered an amount of a psychoactive substance. He would maybe actually consider me a criminal, because it supposedly has the potential of being harmful to ME. Sure, drugs can be harmful, but only a few of them, amongst which we find alcohol - which he probably binges every Saturday night with his friends. I can also add, that the drug in question is one of the lesser harmful drugs (way less dangerous than alcohol). Furthermore, the correct way to determine the toxicity of a drug is by the scientific method, which actually isn&#039;t used in courts here. No, actually, instead of writing a paper, they have a TRIAL, and ask themselves: &quot;To determine the penalty of having drug X, how toxic is drug X in comparison to drug Y?&quot; and actually call in witnesses to determine this. Right there, we are back to the stone age. Truth just doesn&#039;t listen to what doctor Rosen and professor Bobsleigh says about it. Since the 17th century, we&#039;ve learned that we need to use science in order to understand ANYTHING, or make anything of use. <br /><br />Of course, the supposed toxicity of the drug is not the reason he would take me however, obviously. He would take me because it&#039;s his job. Just as some politicians (the stupid ones) take a party and support their every cause, this police supports every law unconditionally. Contrary to the politician however, he&#039;s stuck in that position, since otherwise he&#039;ll be punished. But maybe the toxicity of a drug could be a valid reason to ban it? Maybe. But in order to prevent hypocrisy, one should start with drugs of a higher toxicity than alcohol, which, well, we sing songs about. <br /><br />Anyway, the circus would continue, maybe I would be trialed, and juries and jurors and lawyers and judges, in an intricate game of ranks and &quot;justice&quot; and proofs, would try to prove that I&#039;ve committed this horrible crime that is using drugs! They would play their game, and maybe they would also think that they were doing the absolute right thing to follow the law blindly. Let&#039;s face it, if you&#039;re not making the law - you must follow it blindly. Possibly I would get fined. So they go home and think that they have actually contributed to society, while they haven&#039;t. At least not in this case. All they do is walk forth and back, forth and back, never creating something new. Never thinking for themselves, and never following their own convictions. Maybe they lack the intellect, or don&#039;t care to make a change since they are just happy to get money. These are the men who walk in lines, and who as well make up the great mass of people. The limbs of the small mass of people, the mass of those people who think. Of those with ideas, ideals and motivation - the real makers of anything in this world. Of the most dreaded leaders, the scientists, the guy who thought it would be a great idea to open a sushibar in his town. Of people like DPR. Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve trying to get to. It takes something extra to do something new. To break away from what has been established. Since the majority of people live their entire lives to enforce it, it&#039;s hard. It&#039;s as hard as getting someone to realize they&#039;ve been doing a wrong thing all their life. If you do - they will most likely try to shoot you down. Anything else would be obviously contrary to their entire life. <br /><br />What DPR has done with this site, is to break away. I so look up to you for that, and acknowledge that it is one of the greatest things a man can do. To be honest, it doesn&#039;t matter if it is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;right&quot; to sell drugs over a website. No, it&#039;s about doing something NEW. For we cannot know what is &quot;wrong&quot; and what is &quot;right&quot; unless we try everything, in an unbiased and unprejudiced way. What is best? Try everything and see. That&#039;s why I do drugs. I&#039;m curious. And to be honest - this site hurts NO ONE, if someone is hurt - it&#039;s their own making. Sticking to a single thing in fear, is the recipe for decay. It&#039;s not worthy of a human, who can live so free and happy. DPR - For making this site, I love you. You are the one who risk the most here, and I admire that you still remain loyal to yourself and your work after all this time. It wasn&#039;t until I myself felt threatened, that I understood how easy it is to lose this game. But this site is here to stay. If not in physical form, then in our hearts. If not under your governance, then somebody elses. Just you wait. The older people are - the harder it is for them to change. They have just too much to lose by accepting the truth - too many years wasted being wrong. And the older people are - the sooner they die. Hopefully this site can bring about a change in a younger generation, through free-minded discourse on forums like this. Forums free of prejudice free from doing things just because someone else does them. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll see more of you one day. Either when the news report that the evil mastermind(s) of a vast crime network is going to burn forever in jail, or when we change the laws to make you king(s). Or in a much less spectacular circumstance. Whatever happens, I just want you to know you&#039;re not even close to alone out there, and that what you do is appreciated. There are thousands like me, and we&#039;ve got your back. Love you man. That&#039;s all I really made this account for, and wrote all of this for. We all love you DPR, and don&#039;t you ever forget that.

				Amen brother, what Dread Pirate Roberts has done with SR is phenomenal, the dude&#039;s a fuckin pioneer. <br /><br />Funny thing is in society DPR is probably an average guy like you and me, but in the underground he runs one of the largest drug markets in the world. For all we know he could be your old high school gym teacher or mail man(wouldn&#039;t that be ironic)!<br /><br />Anyways, much thanks to DPR!

				Silk Road has so much potential to be much more than &quot;that internet drug market&quot;.<br />Honestly I&#039;ve never taken any narcotic from SR outside of my house, who did I hurt?<br />I jury of your peers is a group of random zombies that are easy to raise reasonable doubt if you are not buy and selling narcotics from Silk Road.<br />Without actually physical drugs as evidence my lawyer can raise that doubt over those in LE that have a history of evil worst than any drug user.<br />My sheriff makes moonshine and drinks it daily. 1 phone call and I&#039;ll be released within an hour. <br />The facts are that the LE that lurk around here are worst and more deceitful than we are and it&#039;s their job well, I&#039;ve seen LE give breaks to many that should have gone to jail. I dont sell drugs,havent for 15 years. I buy a half/week&#039;s worth of my DOC whenever I can and that&#039;s all that I&#039;ll have that will be found. More than likely only a 1/4 of it will be left if a warrant was served for me, if they think they know where I am...mauh mauh mauh.<br /><br />Seriously though let&#039;s think outside the box and start selling more non drug related items on SR.<br />Still waiting on the first BTC pawnshop cashout vendor. wink, wink. Someone make some hand made jewelry, or clothes. PM90 sells doggie meds...it&#039;s that simple guys, expand and diversify and you might not have to purchase btc&#039;s again.<br /><br /><br />X)<br />nomad<br />
