				You took the thoughts right out of my head Kiwikiikii. &lt;3 <br /><br />The 5 rating system should have never changed. 5/5 should always be if the vendor carried out everything on his/her end in a prompt manner and delivered the product as advertised. They should allow an option such as 6/5 for vendors who go over the top, throw in extra, overweight, are extra helpful, etc.<br /><br />To enhance the system and not fuck it up, they could also add in ways to rate various aspects of vendors, such as average response time(if messaged), friendlyness, etc. Even add an ticker on the vendors page that shows how long most of their orders process for.... I know people hate it when ordering from a vendor and find out it&#039;s gonna process 6 days before shipping.

				we&#039;re not the only ones whove been advocating a split rating system but dpr obviously doesnt give a fuck about making it clearer and more transparent to buyers. It would certianly take alot of heat off of buyers if they could give ratings for different things.

				i agree, i wish there was a way to get him to notice the issues and resolve them because it seems every board you go into feedback is always an issue ...to me that would be screaming for it to be fixed but idk im not the one who makes those calls or i would have changed things by now, but i doubt we will see any fix anytime soon

				Just to add a voice against the browbeat instead of behind it, what makes you think DPR isn&#039;t already working on this? <br /><br />In recent history, the complaints and requests of the SR community have been addressed in some fashion by the current DPR. Now, I will admit I haven&#039;t seen him around recently, but in case you&#039;ve forgotten, we just had a long weekend. DPR is a real person, and does things outside of SR. When he&#039;s got the review system worked out, it&#039;ll get implemented, just like all the other updates have occurred.<br /><br />I&#039;ll venture a guess and say that the recent sporadic downtime has had some degree of relation to updates and back-end changes. Again, just a guess.

I know eBay has a &quot;detailed seller rating&quot; system where the seller is rated from 1- 5 stars based on the accuracy of the item description, seller&#039;s communication, shipping times and shipping/handling charges, so maybe we could use that here. Communication might be a problem though because I&#039;m certain buyers get swamped with a ton of messages, so I&#039;m not sure what the right solution is there.

It is like SR wants to trick newbies into hurting our ratings since there are more 5/5s than they think is best for SR. Seems like a shortcut to a desired metric rather than coming up with a better system. Please give us at least a 20/20 rating system if you want us to lose our 5.0 so a 19/20 really is &quot;Solid, would recommend&quot;.<br />And, please, take down that false text (4/5 = Solid, would recommend) while you work on that project.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i agree with you guys NW , but my thing is if you look at many feedbacks on many vendor pages, one person gives 5/5 for outstanding but another will give 5/5 when product doesnt arrive or stealth is subpar just so they dont get black listed by the vendor...so if you ever want to purchase with the vendor again you give them a 5...i mean everytime i have an issue with orders i will always PM the vendor and let them know my concerns and await a response to address them , but if these problems arent addressed they dont deserve a 5/5....for example i had some bomb ass product from a vendor who shall remain nameless and it was amazing ,but the stealth was sub par and very dangerous...yes the product was great but the shipping practices were some of the worst i seen, so i would msg the vendor and the vendor was only concerned if you got things , yes i did get things but when you can already smell the scent while picking up the package, i mean come on there is no way that vendor really deserved a 5/5 ... i wish the ratings were in .1 or .5 increments i agree a 4/5 is and 80% and that doesnt look good but if buyers could give a 4.7/5 thats like a 94-95% with only a 5/5 for absolute perfection, i think that might help solve things but who knows, my intention is to never screw up someones feedback for no reason i just think there needs to be more wiggle room in the whole rating and feedback system to help benefit both vendors and buyers....and who knows like many have said maybe they are working or already have a fix done i just hope it comes out soon, cause everywhere i go on the forums it seems like the feedback is always a topic of discussion

Now, I will admit I haven&#039;t seen him around recently, but in case you&#039;ve forgotten, we just had a long weekend. DPR is a real person, and does things outside of SR. When he&#039;s got the review system worked out, it&#039;ll get implemented, just like all the other updates have occurred.<br />...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The &quot;4/5 Solid, would recommend&quot; is totally uncool and intentional. If they wanted to fix it, I&#039;d bet $ (worth more than Btc) they could change that text easily. They want us to lose our 5.0&#039;s. Personally, I don&#039;t mind if buyers can give less than a 100% great rating. I just don&#039;t like their only choice being an 80% (or less) rating. That&#039;s just as bad as a 1/5 as far as i am concerned. And saying -20% is &quot;Solid, would recommend&quot; seems blatently false to me.

				This 1-5 stuff is silly why not:<br /><br />Positive - I had a positive experience<br />Negative - I had a negative experience<br /><br />Why does it need to be so complex? Allow weighting, but not such that a single user can override dozens of other users, limit weighting to only allow users to be 2-3x as powerful instead of 50x as powerful.
