				Is it normal for my order to still be processing if I ordered ordered: September 13, 2012, 12:54 am UTC.<br /><br />I contacted him about 13 hours ago, but he hasn&#039;t replied, is it a little too early to be wanting a reply already clarifying that he did receive the order. I got a little nervous, because right when I made the purchase the item went unlisted. I didn&#039;t know if it did that b/c I was the last one to be able to get my hands on it, or if my order got lost somewhere, and he won&#039;t see that I paid for it.<br /><br />here&#039;s his seller page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/fec7e1b9c6<br /><br />PLEASE HELP <br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t doubt he received the order. The package will appear &#039;in transit&#039; once it has been shipped.

				Maybe I&#039;m just stressing man, but I just hate when I&#039;m buying something, and then I get an uneasy feeling after I purchased it, then the seller never returns my messages. You think I&#039;m asking too much too soon from the seller? I mean do they usually reply to messages in under 24 hours?? Or even reply to messages at that in general?? <br /><br />I&#039;m just worried, because this seller wants people with under 5 buys on SR to FE early, and I&#039;m just worried that he might not have record of me purchasing it, but who knows!

				Oh, you finalized early? I would be worried too then - not that I think the vendor is a bad person, but you have no recourse if he does decide to take your money and never ship.<br /><br />To be clear, I have nothing against this vendor and he may be great. I am just pointing out that you have put yourself out on a limb because you didn&#039;t stay in escrow.

				I see now. I guess you can&#039;t finalize early until he marks in transit. Assumed it was just an option for you when checking out. I am learning something every day here.<br /><br />So yeah, your money is it escrow right now. It won&#039;t be released to the vendor until you click finalize.

No vendor should make you FE on small purchases (i.e. &lt;200-250 dollars) unless they have a really good reason to do so, and even then only if you trust then. Otherwise, there&#039;s little you can do if they decide not to honor your order after you FE and jump ship. <br /><br />That being said, the vast majority of vendors wouldn&#039;t do that, but I would still find one that will allow you to keep things in escrow until you get your package (THEN you release the funds) He should answer messages within a day or two (unless they&#039;ve indicated they&#039;re swamped with messages), beyond that I think you&#039;re getting to the &quot;bad service&quot; point.
