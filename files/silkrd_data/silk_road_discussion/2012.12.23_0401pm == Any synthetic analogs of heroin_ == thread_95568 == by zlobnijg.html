				Be careful, ever hear of&nbsp; MPTP.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know about any RC opoids apart from this one:<br />From wiki:<br /><br />Desmethylprodine or 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxypiperidine (MPPP) is an opioid analgesic drug developed in the 1940s by researchers at Hoffmann-La Roche.[1] It is not used in clinical practice, but has been illegally manufactured for recreational drug use. It is an analog of Pethidine (Meperidine), but, since it is not used in medicine, the DEA has labeled it a Schedule I drug in the United States. In fact, it is the reversed ester of pethidine and is listed as having 70% of the potency of morphine.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Contents<br />&nbsp; [hide]&nbsp; 1 As a designer drug 1.1 Toxic impurity<br />&nbsp;<br />2 See also<br />&nbsp;3 External links<br />&nbsp;4 References<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />[edit] As a designer drug<br />&nbsp;<br />The drug was first synthesised in 1977 for recreational purposes by a 23-year old graduate student named Barry Kidston. Kidston had studied a 1947 paper by Albert Ziering.[2] By reversing the ester of the meperidine skeleton, a then-legally uncontrolled drug approaching the potency of morphine was produced.<br />&nbsp;<br />[edit] Toxic impurity<br />&nbsp;<br />However, the intermediate tertiary alcohol is liable to dehydration in acidic conditions if the reaction temperature rises above 30Â°C, and, since Kidston did not realize this and esterified the intermediate with propionic anhydride at an elevated temperature, MPTP was formed as a major impurity.[3] Several days after trying this new batch of his homemade drug, Kidston developed serious Parkinson&#039;s Disease symptoms, as did several friends he had shared the drug with.[4]<br />&nbsp;<br />1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a metabolite of MPTP, causes rapid onset of irreversible symptoms similar to Parkinson&#039;s Disease.[5][6] MPTP is metabolized to the neurotoxin MPP+ by the enzyme MAO-B, which is expressed in glial cells. This selectively kills brain tissue in the area of the brain called the substantia nigra and causes permanent Parkinsonian symptoms.[7]<br />

				You&#039;re shit out of luck, friend.<br /><br />The only thing even REMOTELY similar to what you&#039;re looking for would be Kratom... and AH-soandso number nobody cares about because it&#039;s shit. The AH is GREAT for pain relief, but it is NOT abusable. NO recreational effects whatsoever, and after looking into it a while ago, I found that the only human drug testing on it was mysteriously cancelled, and nowhere on the internet can I find why.<br /><br />I even managed to find someone who was part of the test&#039;s google+ account where he talked about being on it, and then up out of nowhere he never said anything again. Spooky shit.<br /><br />There ARE some extremely potent, legal opiods that I managed to find, but their name escapes me at the moment. Very limited testing, though, and the dosages are in the microgram range with the potency of heroin, so unless you have several thousand dollars to invest in a good microgram scale, you&#039;re SOL because the only places I found them selling at were clearnet bulk dealers.

Nobody is in the market for an untested, potentially dangerous chem that doesn&#039;t even get you high.<br /><br />However, if all you&#039;re looking for is pain relief... AH-7921 is probably your best bet. It&#039;s superior to most every painkiller on the market as far as that goes. But not even big pharma wants to go at it, because it&#039;s not really all that addictive and it produces no euphoria. If that hit the market than all the addicted oxy heads that clamor every month to get their scripts filled would soon fly away.
