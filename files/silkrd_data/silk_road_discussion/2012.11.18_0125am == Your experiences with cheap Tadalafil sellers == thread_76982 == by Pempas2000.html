				Hi,<br /><br />i am planning to buy a larger amount of generic Cialis. That Cialis is a great drug I know, because I have already&nbsp; swallowed original German Cialis, (from a German pharmacy).That Indian generic Cialis must be also very good, is&nbsp; understandable, becourse it is FDA regulated as American. Unfortunately, I have had bad experience with fake generic Cialis ( that appearing as not possible, because the purchase price in India is already extremely low ... but fake generics are standard practice). Myself&nbsp; caught once a Tadacip 20mg tablet, (luckily I had swallowed only 1/3), that brought scary, extreme blood pressure, nausea and extreme tachycardia. I know of others that they had tablets with no, or significantly attenuated effect. (But we all bought that some were else in the net, not here.)<br /><br />The original, safe products from the German chemist, i can not afford in a long run. Here in the forum, there are some dealers, who offer their goods extremely cheap.&nbsp; <br />(for example: koptevo(99) , PILL popperz(94), and freegenerics )<br /><br />Of course no one of you has a tablet test lab at home, but who&nbsp; has already ordered Tadafil at this and other cheap suppliers, would please post here their subjective impressions:<br />Side effects and effect in comparison to the original pharmacy goods.<br />,<br />Thank you very much

				I&#039;ve purchased mostly sildenafil but some tadafil also. I&#039;ve purchased from Angelina, BifBuff, Koptevo, and nicedeal. Im also failiar with freegenerics offering. <br /><br />Angelina - Have purchased both sildenafil 100 mg and tadafil 20 g from. I believe the sildenafil was from aurochem and the tadafil was cipla. I always test product&nbsp; the product worked great no side effects for me. Angelina is very professional and you&#039;ll receive package very quick. She is the best of vendors out there.&nbsp; Took about 3 - 4 days to arrive. <br /><br />Bigbuff - I purchased 100 sildenafil&nbsp; 100mg ... they came loose stamped with 100 on them thats all. No lab imprints at all. They worked very good !! took about 7 days to get from order. Think he sent a few extra too which was nice. <br /><br />Koptevo - I purchased 100 sildenafil from him .... He claims they are centurion but the ones I got were marked viprogram they took about 8 days to arrive US to US unfortunately he mistakenly sent me the 50 mg&#039;s rather than the 100&#039;s claims he will fix this I&quot;ll update here when he does.&nbsp; Took about 8 days to arrive which is getting close to importing from India. In all fairness there was columbus day in there. <br /><br />Purchased cialis from nicedeal very fast very good product. <br /><br />freegenerics is new very little feedback and ships from India. The prices seem too good to be true. He also has a wonderful selection. I&#039;d be all over that but smells like a scam to me... we&#039;ll see in time.
