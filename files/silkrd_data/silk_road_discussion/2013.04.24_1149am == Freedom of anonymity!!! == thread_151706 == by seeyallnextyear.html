				Do we have it? No!!! Discuss the following, please.....<br /><br />Quote from: zerik on March 29, 2013, 07:03 am<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote from: seeyallnextyear on March 29, 2013, 02:35 am<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don&#039;t use Atlantis.&nbsp; For God&#039;s sake.&nbsp; It most likely IS LE.&nbsp; And if it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s someone who doesn&#039;t know jack shit about running a business.&nbsp; If they did, they would stay the fuck away from litecoins. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for everyone thinking Litecoins is the only currency they take, I don&#039;t think that is correct.&nbsp; The site says thy accept them, doesn&#039;t they anything about how they &quot;exclusively&quot; accept them.&nbsp; If I was LE, and I wanted to a site like that, I would accept both.&nbsp; Because it opens up a whole new group of buyers that way.&nbsp; On top of BTC.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just don&#039;t think about it.&nbsp; If anyone takes a chance with that mess, I won&#039;t feel bad for ya.&nbsp; It would mean you have a very very low IQ level, and you do not belong on the Road.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peace<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You might be right about the little coins. As I recall, it did say they accept them. But I do not know if it is exclusive of other currency. I didn&#039;t stay long.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, right now Sr is good enough. Not going to risk security to save a couple of bucks.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I still don&#039;t think it is run by LE. They could not deliver illegal goods like that. They wouldn&#039;t go through all of that to nab people buying for personal use or even low level dealers. The pay off would not be worth the investment. Then again who knows.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I think it is more likely the entire site is one big scam. It&#039;s Impossible to know right now. Only time can tell for sure.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Still it would be nice to have more livable options should anything happen to Sr.<br /><br /><br />Zerik, you are on the right path my friend. You have to have faith in your best instincts from now on.<br /><br />To respond to your statements I have only this to say.<br /><br />Um..... no, actually the government does anything and everything it possibly can to pull in every single cent it possibly can to pay back the money they owe to the globalists. Which we all know to actually be the Fed times one million at least.<br /><br />LE has now become in all actuality the new generation of small time &quot;robber barons&quot; of old. Small and large, the US Department of Justice, the DOD, the NSA and the CIA, and many more not really needed to type completely out, have long since run the drug trade. They are all under the control of the people who have the most power, which of course is who, well I&#039;ll give you a hint, they now have the entire Metro Boston City Area under their custody and control. And why?<br /><br />Ok, if we aren&#039;t asking these questions ourselves then we are definitely not focusing on the real &quot;big picture&quot;. I can&#039;t even go into real detail about this due to the fact that that anything I reference someone will call me out on it and call me a f&amp;@king terrorist. So to hell with anyone who doesn&#039;t have enough common sense to actually ask the real questions here.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t know if I will even be ordering anything until we have a though security &quot;quality assurance&quot; test conducted here. They now have complete control of the clearnet as we speak; this is a fact.&nbsp; Who is to say that we do not have any serious security threats going on here in the basement?<br /><br />Process this, I dare you.&nbsp; Who is the world&#039;s largest supplier of drugs to the entire planet beyond this or any other black market. You guessed it, the world&#039;s largest investor in crypto-currency&#039;s, the U.S.<br /><br />Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.............<br /><br />Jesus,<br /><br />I am calling you out. You who are monitoring every word that is said on these forums and always have been. Flagging many more posts than our mods who work their asses off to steer all of us in the right direction with our discussions here on this forum. I have faith in our mods, they do the best they can with, well, no real power. I salute you kind sirs. <br /><br />Step forward and tell me who truly runs one of the largest markets in the known world. The drug trade........<br /><br />DPR, I have always put my undying trust in you my friend. If you truly are the Pirate you say you are, you will flex to us and our enemies the true might we all know you have. We have been mainstream for a considerably long amount of time.<br /><br />Mainstream only gets you one thing in this world.&nbsp; Taxed until you die............. Most of the time that is with a black bag and team of mercs...<br /><br />This foresworn is my testimony. Bound by the only thing I have.... My word.......... Which stem from much more credible sources than our FBI, who are informed by unknown sub-concept groups of the CIA, who in turn tell the mainstream and now the entire social media agenda. Does any of this sound familiar?<br /><br />Tor supposed to be secure, not allowing anyone to see where exactly you are logging in from.&nbsp; Bullshit.&nbsp; Not anymore. Anyone who has noticed the crazy things currently going on, in our &quot;Matrix&quot; escape, and in deep into the &quot;Matrix&quot; itself exploring everything else that makes this realm such a glorious place we can call home.<br /><br />I am getting sick and tired of these giant government internet securities contractors who have always caused us headaches and haven&#039;t even started pushing us around yet.<br /><br />By the way, this will be the perfect time to out some parasites. If anyone quotes anything I have said here, without giving any evidence to the contrary of which I have spoken in solemn confidence here with only my fellow realists on this road, shall they be outed as being against what it is we truly strive for here. <br /><br />Freedom. The freedom of having an actual free market we can call our own. If you are against freedom, then you are a threat to everyone using this site with confidence of their privacy on this site and anywhere else for that matter. Against the anonymity we have always worked so hard to keep not only here but the entire net.<br /><br />Please, I have finding it hard to sleep at the moment.&nbsp; If anyone would like to discuss this further I will starting my own thread labeled &quot;Freedom of Anonymity&quot;. If you would like to ask questions or share anything any of us truly should know, or anyone who would like to fess up to what you know.&nbsp; Please, I urge you to post.<br /><br />We are at war.... Well, at least one person paying attention needed to say it.<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />
