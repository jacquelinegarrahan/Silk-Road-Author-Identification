				I just received an order today, and the quality is totally crap! It wouldn&#039;t be such a big deal if it was a small order, but it was for nearly $1000! According to recent forum posts, many people over the last week have had the same problem with this person. Am I just going to be screwed, or is there a chance I can go to resolution, and get at least some of my money back? Anyone have any experiences with situations like this?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Absolutely try to work it out with the vendor.&nbsp; If you go through resolution center and end up with a refund, it will add to your refund rate tremendously since the order was so big.<br /><br />Also is this a vendor you have purchased from before, who maybe just has a bad batch?&nbsp; I would hope that you were already comfortable purchasing smaller amounts from this particular vendor, rather than doing a $1000 order based on others&#039; feedback alone...<br /><br />Finally, post in the forums regarding your order--leave honest feedback so others will have a reference.&nbsp; Either on the vendors forum thread, or start a new thread if it&#039;s very important or there is no vendor thread.<br /><br />Who is the vendor, and what did you order, if I may ask?

				Guessing it&#039;s heroin and the vendors name starts with a T. Give him a chance to resolve it first, then if things don&#039;t turn out right tell everyone.
