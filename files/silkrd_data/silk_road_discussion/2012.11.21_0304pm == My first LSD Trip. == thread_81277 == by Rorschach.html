				I am posting in the wrong section on purpose because this board gets the most views so I might get quick replies as I would like to decide before 6.<br />I have two lsd tabs advertised as 80ug. I am planning to take them today after work but I have few concerns:<br /><br />1) I want to go at work tomorrow. Will a huge spliff allow me to sleep?<br />Last time when I tripped on 25i-nbome I ended up sleeping 40 minutes and went to work. Thank fuck I work in a office. (my plan is to trip for 6 hours and then go to sleep)<br /><br />2) The setting is not the best. I&#039;ll do it home and half way through the trip my mom will come home. Will I be able to have a normal conversation?<br /><br />I had no problems talking to my mom on weed, 25i-nbome, cocaine, mdma, and many other drugs. For some reason I&#039;m a bit scared of lsd. In the worst case scenario I&#039;ll tell her I took LSD. She will understand as she is extremely open minded but I would rather not let her find out.<br /><br />3) I&#039;m not sure of the dosage of the tabs I have, the vendor said 80ug. Should I take 1 tab or both? I really, but really don&#039;t want my first trip on lsd to be weak. <br />I think I will be able to handle both the tabs considering that I&#039;m not new to drugs. (roughly 4 years)<br /><br />Note: I am aware of the fact that you can always take more drugs but never less. <br /><br />Thank you in advance. <br /><br />I&#039;m not some overexcited kid that can&#039;t wait for the weekend to try it but I was planning to roll this weekend + going to few clubs and meeting old friends.

				Do you mean you want to decide before 6PM? And you have work tomorrow at what time?<br /><br />I would not do it if I had to work the next day.&nbsp; Remember the trip will basicaly last 12 hours.&nbsp; Plus you probably want the next day free so you can properly relax during it and not be counting down the hours till you have to be at work.

				80 ug is&nbsp; a very light dose - you probably will only feel a light buzz. In my opinion very light lsd is a waste. Both tabs should give a decent first time trip.<br /><br />It will peak after a couple of hours and expect that it will be clearly visible to anyone that you are tripping if you start talking at least in the first 3-4 hours after peak.<br />It will last usually 10-12 hrs. You may well have trouble going to sleep even with a huge spliff until some hours after the trip has ended. I certainly have.<br /><br />If I were you I would really wait for a better time - like in the weekend. Having a good trip is all about settings. Being in a stressful situation really ruins the fun.

				My advice don&#039;t trip wait till you have a better set/setting. You don&#039;t want people interrupting your trip it never ends well.<br /><br />When you do LSD you want at least 2 days off work. (You will need time to integrate the experience)<br /><br />Plus you wont sleep for at least 10-12 hours when on lsd. LSD is not a toy it will be like nothing you have ever experienced in your entire life. It will change you and how you view the world forever.<br /><br />Also smoking weed will only intensify your trip.

				I have found that even with no tolerance, weed has absolutely no effect on relaxing an LSD trip.&nbsp; I have tripped a few times where after 10 hours, we would start blazing up like an ounce between 4 of us, and 12 hours later (i.e., after being awake all night and as the sun is now coming up), we had almost no weed left and were still pretty wired.<br /><br />Another thing is it is acceptable to trip if you have things to do after the trip, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it if you don&#039;t know how the tabs you are taking will affect you.&nbsp; It&#039;s not fun in any event.&nbsp; AND, smoking mad weed while you&#039;re tripping will only serve to give you a massive weed hangover the next day when you have shit to do.&nbsp; Regardless of how easy your job may be, and how isolated you will be while working, you will probably want nothing more than to do whatever else you feel like doing, and that will not be sitting at work.<br /><br />(As a side note, I am a computer programmer, and I find that LSD &quot;magically&quot; helps me do the design work portion of my job like a champ.&nbsp; Most other jobs probably don&#039;t work this way with LSD use, but I have taken small doses of LSD a couple of times for that express purpose).<br /><br />Bottom line, if it&#039;s your first time, save it for a time when you have no responsibilities and a good setting to trip in.

				i&#039;ve drank over a 1/5 of captain morgans on lsd and couldn&#039;t sleep. you will be up for at least 24 hrs. do it when you have a couple days to just sit there smoke pot and drink excessive amounts of alcohol.

				I&#039;ve never been able to sleep on LSD. My thoughts seem hypercharged with creativity and I can&#039;t seem to turn my mind off. If you have an Ambien or another drug, that might help. Pot just intensifies the experience though. <br /><br />On that note, LSD really isn&#039;t a part drug. I&#039;ve never thought of it that way, so I usually take it with a close friend or by myself on a weekend with some time off. I watch trippy videos and just generally contemplate shit. I wouldn&#039;t take it if I had to work the next day--I did before, and it seemed to go OK, but I was still just barely &quot;there&quot; and I probably was talking so abstractly so most couldn&#039;t even gather a point...

				That would be a bit stupid! You will be weird as fuck, not at work please. One friend did it and he ended up calling me saying that he thinks he&#039;s gonna have a heart attack. He was scared shitless I tried my best to calm him down but there was no fucking way. He was ok in the end but he thought&nbsp; he will die that night. That is fucking scary to me on lsd tbh.

				Holy shit haha. Meth + lsd sounds like the perfect recipe to give yourself the worst trip, and have the energy to do a lot of dumb shit when you freak out. Listen to everyone in the thread dude, don&#039;t take the acid. Wait til the weekend and eat those tabs in a relaxed situation, maybe a friend&#039;s place or something
