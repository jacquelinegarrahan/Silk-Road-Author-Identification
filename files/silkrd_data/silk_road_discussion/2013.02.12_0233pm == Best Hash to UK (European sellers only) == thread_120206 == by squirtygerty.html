				I have been browsing looking for some hash to buy bu the reviews are fairly limitted.<br /><br />I want some good quality strong hash, I don&#039; mind very much about its origins but I want it to be strong enough for an everyday smoker.<br /><br />Looking at stuff under £10/gram coming from europe. Has anyone on here had first hand experience with some out of this world hash recently and would like to share their advice?<br />

				Had the same problem as you, it&#039;s limited hash reviews.<br />Let me know, are you looking for 100g + or is it just for personal smoke? I have bought lots before here so I can help you I think.

				SpanishFly http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/48d6dac95e and Emerald http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c1be9f2c59 have nice looking Pakistani stuff. I&#039;ve used Emerald before for weed, good vendor with fast shipping.<br />If you&#039;re looking for Moroccan, JanDeBouff http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/cfdbab9179 just put up some lovely looking polm and pollen. Again, I&#039;ve used him for weed, great vendor.<br />If you like your nice hash, keep an eye on Sonni http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0068dd9e07 . He&#039;s out at the moment, and only had bud for the past month or so, but when he does have hash, ;D!<br /><br />These are just the vendors I&#039;ve had experience with or have heard lots of good things about though. There&#039;s probably some bargains to be had out there, anyone else found anything good?

				I am looking for some personal smoke really, between 3-7grams really.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t really got much expertise in smoking hash as in the UK without silk road you pretty much take what you can get. Been smoking for about 8 or 9 years and it seems to have pretty much disappeared from around my area in the last few years. What do you reckon? I&#039;ve heard good things about the pakistani hash from SpanishFly too.<br />

				Yeah, over here it&#039;s pretty much soapbar or nothing!<br />To be honest, they&#039;re all good hashes, it&#039;s just gonna come down to personal preference. Could be worth grabbing a 3.5 from Jan, and a gram of each of SpanishFly&#039;s, see what you like.

				I got 5 grams of his caramella last year, its not really my thing its to intense on the mind it would be good for if you want to be fucked up with friends more of a young persons hash. It made my stomach feel like it was going to take off like a mad swirling feeling. Its a good wake and bake hash but cant see it being any use for anything else for me anyway.<br /><br />I want to try his 000

				THE SCURVY CREW has some of the BEST hash on the road right now! Promise! Check our review thread linked in my sig.<br /><br />Currently we have a VERY high quality sativa hash that is getting so many great reviews... To the point that we are working on a contest to prove it. Personally, it&#039;s the best hash I have ever smoked (But I tend to stick to grass)<br /><br />We also have some excellent hash that&#039;s &lt;10<br /><br />Aaaaaand we have some samples of a NEW hash that is supposed to be even better than the sativa! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Everything currently ships from Europe, but soon we&#039;ll be adding domestic US shipping as well :)<br />Check out our listings are at the bottom of TSC vendor page linked below in my sig<br /><br />Hey OP, if you order some of our hash we&#039;ll throw in one of our Weekend Boredom kits for FREE :) just PM me or reference this post with your pgp encrypted address on SR.<br /><br />

This hashish is only found in certain fields in the mountain tops near Azila, within the tightly controlled red zone. Great care is taken in growing, preparing it and transporting it. The growers and north Africans prefer that it stays in northern Africa, being transported to large customers in Egypt, Morocco and Lybia. We however can secure small 250g quantities on a monthly basis.<br /><br />1g of our premium Pakistani pollen<br />One of the finest pollen hash´s around. You can see the marked quality instantly, although when cut you can see the distinctive light color and fluffy texture of pollen, This hash remains firm although slightly pliable when handled. the distinct smell combined with the unique texture are a dead giveaway of a quality Pakistani pollen.<br /><br />All three will be sent individually vac sealed to prevent a mixing of their unique qualities and to prevent them drying out. <br /><br />ACE<br /><br />
