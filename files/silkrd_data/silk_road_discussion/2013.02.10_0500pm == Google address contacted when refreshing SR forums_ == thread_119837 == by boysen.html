				So I was refreshing the SR forums earlier and I noticed for about a second that it said either &#039;Connecting to&#039; or &#039;Connected to&#039; and then lh3.ggpht.com which seems to be an address related to Picasa, definitely owned by Google. This happened two or three times, getting a screenshot of it those times never crossed my mind and when I refreshed again to take a screenshot it no longer appeared. I was in the &#039;Silk Road discussion&#039; sub-forum when it happened. Still not able to recreate it but it definitely seems a bit sketchy, anyone else seen this or know what it is?

				No replies here but I am bumping this since it happened again. Got a screenshot of it this time.<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=wk2.jpg<br />Happened on two refreshes and since then I can no longer reproduce it. Not on the page where it happened (shown in the screenshot) or anywhere else.

				Strange stuff, don&#039;t really know what it would imply. <br /><br />Maybe SR is run by a Google subsidiary, It would explain why it hasn&#039;t been taken down by the govt yet. I really think if they wanted to they could stop SilkRoad. <br /><br />But don&#039;t listen to my conspiracy theories, it can be dangerous for your sanity.&nbsp; <br /><br />GrizZ

				I&#039;m guessing that it&#039;s because either you have some random addon installed, or one of the images that loaded in the page is stored on that server.<br /><br />Or the css file is from there (cascading style sheet).&nbsp; Or some XML referenced a namespace there.&nbsp; Or an embedded object in the post was stored there.&nbsp; Etc., etc., etc..&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot that goes on in a full-fledged web browser: the point is that unless it&#039;s an unknown exploit, Tor should protect your identity all the same.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s a serious bug that could get people in oppressive government nations killed -- as in it isn&#039;t just drug users they&#039;re trying to protect (i.e. they have real motivation to keep us safe).<br /><br />If you&#039;re in Linux, open a terminal window and the next time you see it flash by, type this:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">netstat -peanut<br /></code><br />... and look for the matching IP address and executable name.&nbsp; It may be firefox or it may be plugin-container or something else.&nbsp; You can also hit CTRL+I to view the page info, and click on the &quot;media&#039; button.&nbsp; See if there are any images listed from that address.&nbsp; Other than that... forget it happened, I guess.

				I have websockets disabled.&nbsp; For no real reason, just because I have no reason to use them and don&#039;t need them.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible there&#039;s some javascript websocket action going on, which would explain why I&#039;ve never seen such a thing but others have.<br /><br />I also just realized you can enable debug-level logging in Vidalia and save the log to a file if you really want to dig into this further.<br />

				Just to make sure - are you using the Tor Browser Bundle from torproject.org?<br /><br />Click on the &quot;Help&quot; menu - does it show &quot;TorBrowser Help&quot; or does it say &quot;Firefox&quot; (or something else)?<br /><br />Click on the &quot;View&quot; menu,&nbsp; Toolbars and select &quot;Add-on Bar&quot;. Does it show any active add-ons, or is it empty?

				I have never seen this, and I (like most others I assume) watch the connection like a hawk....<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;You do not happen to have Google tool bar install on the browser you use to connect to SR do you?!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Oh -- I bet you&#039;re accessing the forums through the onion.to website, huh?<br /><br />Do not do that.&nbsp; It&#039;s extremely unsafe.&nbsp; Just bookmark the forum address and SR address and only go to them directly.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">SR Market&nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br />Forums&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion<br /></code>

				I&#039;m definitely not the best on security on this site but I&#039;m not stupid. :p<br /><br />Using Tor Browser Bundle, private browsing, no addons installed beyond the three that come with the bundle, no google toolbar. Not going through onion.to.<br /><br />I&#039;d assume it&#039;s loaded from something as well but strange that it only happens rarely, two times in a row and then stops completely again. If I get it on my Linux machine I&#039;ll run that command.

				I believe there are certain server-side SMF add-ons that pull content like that from google.<br />Which ought to be disabled if so. Though frankly the danger in that situation would be to SR or whoever is hosting the forums if it&#039;s not DPR himself. <br /><br />They did upgrade the SMF installation recently, no? Maybe Inigo knows...<br /><br />
