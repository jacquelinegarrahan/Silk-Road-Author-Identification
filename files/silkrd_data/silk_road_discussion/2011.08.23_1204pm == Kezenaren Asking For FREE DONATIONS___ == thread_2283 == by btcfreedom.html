I&#039;ve realized your comments and it is the right approach.<br /><br />better professional than burnt the fuck out. the recent horse posts clearly reflect that you were right my man...look at this disaster.<br /><br />we can&#039;t afford have this type of lackey approach to anything. vendors have got to be serious business or GTFO.<br /><br />a listing is just a listing with or without a seller account, until you TRUST your buyer.<br /><br />First time trust is ALL on the seller. <br /><br />New sellers gain my trust by coming correct, QUICKLY. Then trust is built and a day or two can go by without either party weeping out <br /><br />of their ass.<br /><br />TRUST peeps. TRUST.<br /><br />One.<br /><br />b

While it&#039;s alright, I don&#039;t have the urge to really do it more often- I&#039;ll usually puke for an hour or two after my high, and its effects aren&#039;t as desirable to me as, say, MDMA.<br /><br />That being said, it&#039;s a nice way to chill the fuck out after a bad day at work.
