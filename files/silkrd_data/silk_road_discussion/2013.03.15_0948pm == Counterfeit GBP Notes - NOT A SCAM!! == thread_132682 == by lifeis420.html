				Suppose this should technically be in the product offers section but this is busier here and I want more of a discussion really than to offer them.<br />I have lurked around onion-land for a long time and have seen LOTS of people offering counterfeit currencies all over the place (BMR, Hidden Wiki&#039;s - even SR) but each and every one has turned out to be a scam in the end.<br />I remember around December last year a vendor at BMR was claiming to sell fake Euro and GBP notes and actually offered genuine free samples- the dude took a huge risk but it paid of for him big time.<br />People applied for samples, which they did receive completely free. The notes that were sent out were genuine 20GBP notes, it seems either no one tried to pay these in to a bank/confirm they were indeed fake or some people thought they were so good that they were accepted everywhere.<br />Once the buyers got the real money almost all of them went on to order as many fake notes as they possibly could- obviously none of them received. Think the guy must have made at least 5K out of that little scam.<br />Thing is that because almost all of these offers are scams, would anyone buy legitimate fake notes?<br />I can get pretty good quality counterfeit GBP notes (only GBP and only 10&#039;s &amp; 20&#039;s). They are made of the correct paper and look the part, the face which shows up when held up to a light does appear but I do not know about UV/pen test because I have never tried it. One criticism of them is that they dont have that &quot;money smell&quot; if you know what I mean.<br />I have used them in several different shops/given a few to some dealers whom I dont like and no one has ever been suspicious they are fakes, I have only tried the £10 myself which IMHO are better as in shops they seem to not check these so much.<br />I&#039;m not certain of the exact price for them because I was only given £100 to test out but I do know they are sold in £1200&#039;s and I think they are half face value or maybe even a litte less (£500 for £1200 or something).<br />Does anyone think there would be a market for this if I sent out a good few free samples to legitimate well known buyers here?<br />Also I know some trustworthy vendors here with good stats who i&#039;m sure would sell them if the demand was there.

				There absolutely is a market for these, but they&#039;re not allowed on SR - try BMR.

				Ah damnit sorry guys.<br />This was not always in the rules then because I definitely remember seeing some on SR a good while ago, in the armory era anyways.<br />Does anyone know how much is the bond for a vending account on BMR?<br />I guess I might make a thread here once I get some to send out a few free samples and then if they are popular enough list them over at BMR.<br />

				Maybe the notes were genuine, its worth maybe sending 20 people a 20 pound note, using scam accounts to sell 35 sales then getting FE as people get greedy to be honest!<br /><br />Remember if it seems too good to be true it usually is.<br /><br />Forged notes are not something I hear a lot of but it does happen.<br /><br />Pound coins are&nbsp; the big thing!<br /><br />And most forgery now is digital but fake IDs are big.<br /><br />And, of course, forged money sales would make SR 100&nbsp; times the target as they would be for drugs.<br /><br />Its a real serious offense and more agencies on on your case for that, <br /><br />Little wonder SR ban it! Tactical move that makes SR a safer place. The authorities do not care about drugs although they do pretend to be opposed to them and join in the chorus of &#039;drugs are evil&#039;. Sure, the joint I got here is going to make me kill children and chop off my neighbors dogs head. <br /><br />But SR is very wise to stay way from forged monies.<br /><br />And its too easy to scam people. I bet many would FE for forged notes as soon as a few dozen raving reviews came in with notes working 100% in all ways. Sell real notes then grab FE and run. Like coke in a way!&nbsp; ;D

				Hey guys,<br />My OP has been misinterpreted.<br />I am not offering anything, just checking to see what peoples opinions are on whether or not they would sell.<br />I understand why SR has banned them- as I explained, every single offer for notes I have seen has been a scam and as I said that is exactly what some of the scammers did; sent real money out as a sample then just scammed for the order. Its a risk but it seems to pay of.<br />The notes I get are fake and would not be accepted at a bank or stand up to extreme scrutiny but they are still pretty good- anyone who received a free sample would be able to confirm that the note is indeed fake but also see that they are of pretty high quality (and also in 10&#039;s which I have never seen before).<br />As far as advertising without being a vendor goes; no I am not a vendor, however I personally know a few high profile vendors here on SR who would be the ones selling the notes (obviously not here on SR since it is against the terms, to which I agree&nbsp; as 99% are scams but there ARE real counterfeit notes out there and people CAN buy them).<br />Perhaps i&#039;ll offer samples on BMR and then sell a few- see how it goes.<br />-Life
