				I&#039;m not sure if there are just multitudes of children on the forum this past week, but the displays of entitlement is disgusting.<br /><br />Read this sentence carefully:<br /><br />Silkroad is an ONLINE website where you can purchase ILLEGAL DRUGS and other things, ANONYMOUSLY and SAFELY and have them SENT TO YOUR HOUSE.<br /><br />Do you get it? Do you realise how fucking amazing that is? How rare? How unbelievable? How impossible that is? This site is something that should never be taken for granted and most certainly, it is NOT something you have a right to. <br /><br />Yes it&#039;s frustrating (and slightly worrying, and potentially expensive (for me at least, but others too)) that it was down. And it&#039;s frustrating that it&#039;s down now. But there is no reason to be worried just yet because we know there are issues. It&#039;s not surprising it&#039;s down. <br /><br />Every time there is a cunty comment, especially comments directly attacking, deriding, mocking, DPR, the chance that he reads that comment goes up. And what happens if he reads a few too many of them? He may just tell us to go get fucked. <br /><br />I gather he&#039;s busting his ass trying to get the site running smoothly again. He&#039;s sacrificed many aspects of his personal life so we can buy fucking drugs, and if he gets caught.....he&#039;s going to jail for a long time. Along with many of us. I&#039;d be a little more respectful and reverent of the guy. <br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t be getting angry AT ALL that the site is down. Anger is Indignation and Indignation implies inherently that some wrongdoing or injustice has been suffered by yourself. Has that occurred? Aside from inconvenience and perhaps some theoretical financial problems, nothing has happened.<br /><br />Chill the fuck out, appreciate this place and stop posting your nonsensical retarded threads you ungrateful, narcissistic fucks.

				Yeah, it&#039;s an absolute joke.&nbsp; People have truly lost the plot.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve got $100 sitting in my SR wallet, but if it never comes back, so be it.&nbsp; Losing the money would be worth the experience I&#039;ve had these past 6 months.&nbsp; Some incredible products we&#039;ve had access to.&nbsp; Can&#039;t take this for granted. <br /><br />If SR does fall down, you can bet there&#039;s a LOT of smart people out there who understand the demand for this kind of thing,&nbsp; so you&#039;d expect alternatives to pop up.&nbsp; I know of one already.&nbsp; It just needs the community to embrace (and trust) it so it can become a viable alternative.

Honestly I&#039;m more sick of the self-righteous people trying to call out the complainers.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, with the amount of money some of us have given SR (in the form of commission and buying a vendor account) yes, we do deserve timely updates at the least. There is nothing entitled about wanting a service you paid for, or wanting information as to why the service isn&#039;t being provided. We don&#039;t have to bow down and excuse everything the admins do. We are free to complain if we feel a fuck up has happened. For the most part, DPR has handled this wonderfully. But I hope our complaints are heard and something changes in the communication.

				Uhh actually the sense of entitlement comes from paying for a service, which we all do on every trade. Yes silkroad is amazing and you can suck dpr&#039;s cock all you want, but its still a service thats being PAID for by us. I dont care about the downtime if its just short term but saying everyone has to tread on eggshells just because we&#039;re &quot;lucky&quot; is idiotic.

				Yeah. It sucks that lots of us have 100s and 1000s of dollars locked away in the site. But it was there last time I logged on, and what I left there will still be there when it comes back.<br /><br />I have no reason to not think this is the case. Ill be wrong when I&#039;m wrong.<br /><br />And any frustrations I have I&#039;ll articulate in an inoffensive, respectful manner. Is that too much to expect? I don&#039;t particularly want to suck DPR&#039;s cock, but that doesn&#039;t mean I need to be rude, like a lot of the cunts running around this place. <br /><br />Nothing to do with &quot;walking on eggshells,&quot; it&#039;s got to do with Motivation: It&#039;s obvious from DPR&#039;s post&#039;s that this place is in part a manifestation of his ideals and principles. Something more than just profit seems to a motivating factor in the creation and maintenance of this site. I for one certainly acknowledge and appreciate the principles of self-determination this website allows for me. It drives me fucking insane that I&#039;m not freely able to buy drugs and use them whenever the fuck I want. It&#039;s really important to me. And it&#039;s not really about the drugs - although there&#039;s no need to downplay my enjoyment there either - it&#039;s that something inside my brain that recoils at the reality that I&#039;m restricted from ingesting something, whether to experiment, relax, or to mow my lawns like a Savage. This site provides sovereignty.<br /><br />And if I feel that way, others must to do, but if the voices of the spoiled cunts becomes to load and this place gets taken for granted, and money isn&#039;t the Motivating factor for DPR, then why would he even bother?

				Back in my polling analysis days, we&#039;d joke that the assholes are always the loudest when it comes to reacting to an event. It would seem SR isn&#039;t immune to this phenomenon.<br /><br />That said, I look at doing business on SR like buying something off Craigslist - no party really has any kind of guarantee, but it&#039;s much easier and quicker than if I didn&#039;t have the service. It&#039;s easy to get real pissed real quick with an outage of a service one relies on, but every time I feel myself getting frustrated, I just think - would I rather not have it at all?

Honestly I&#039;m more sick of the self-righteous people trying to call out the complainers.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, with the amount of money some of us have given SR (in the form of commission and buying a vendor account) yes, we do deserve timely updates at the least. There is nothing entitled about wanting a service you paid for, or wanting information as to why the service isn&#039;t being provided. We don&#039;t have to bow down and excuse everything the admins do. We are free to complain if we feel a fuck up has happened. For the most part, DPR has handled this wonderfully. But I hope our complaints are heard and something changes in the communication.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do you understand that SR isn&#039;t your run of the mill site? i don&#039;t think you do. Yes in an ideal world it would be nice to have timely updates and know more about whats going on but just so you know SR is illegal so posting whats happening on this forum would be a very very bad move. LE obviously monitor this forum closely and any info gleamed from putting your mind at rest could compromise the whole site. Giving ETAs and the like just gives authorities more info than the should have. It was perfectly sensible for DPR to play his cards close to his chest despite how ever many people spat their dummy. Just try to remember its not Amazon and you have no governing body to put complaints to. just be happy such a site exists.

				As much as I disagree with what some people have to say about Silk Road, it is still a service that us users are paying for. This is not a charity service. It is a commercial service and the owner(s) receive a very large cut of the profits (somebody else put the figure at $6,000 per day).<br /><br />Yes, this site is amazing and we should be grateful for it, but that doesn&#039;t mean we should bend over and let the admin do whatever he wants. If people don&#039;t like the way the site is being operated and expect more from the admin, they have a right to say so.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a business and the customers, buyers and sellers, expect a certain quality of service. They have that right.<br /><br />I am unhappy with the lack of a proper explanation for the immense downtime.<br /><br />If this was a free service, then yeah, we should all probably shut the fuck up and let DPR do his thing... but it&#039;s not.

				And the sense of entitlement trundles on. Money is not the be all and end all, if he&#039;s making nothing or a million a day shouldn&#039;t factor into it at all. I for one need to open a new account and are waiting patiently to do so. In the mean time i can always use BMR and that&#039;s the crotch of the matter. His incentive is to get this site back up and running otherwise he looses his commission to BMR. There&#039;s more sites out there than SR its just that SR is the most known, and if it keeps the noobs away from other sites then that&#039;s fine with me.

				I second the happiness that the site is back up.<br /><br />Does anyone wonder if this is all connected? Something tells me Silk Road was attacked, not only in its website being pushed offline but in an onslaught of trolling to it&#039;s forum. Some kind of rival site maybe to make the community move there? <br />Who cares DPR has agreed to explain everything when the time is right, i&#039;m certain when that time comes &#039;cleaning up the trolls&#039; from the forum will certainly be a top priority also.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yeah, consumers shouldn&#039;t care about whether or not they&#039;re getting quality assurance on some service that they&#039;re paying for that could very easily come from anywhere else. Oh wait, that&#039;s like just the sort of thing that consumers should be all over.
