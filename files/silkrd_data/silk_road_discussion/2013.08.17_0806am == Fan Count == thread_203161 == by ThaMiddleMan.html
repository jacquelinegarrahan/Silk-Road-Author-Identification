				Not sure if I hit the wrong button or not, but the screen shrunk , my vendor home page shrunk , the set up changed ( i.e. amount of transactions , rating, and how many fans) or is this the new home page, but really I was looking for my fan count.&nbsp; I dont see it anymore

				It appears to be gone for now. Maybe they will bring it back and it was an oversight, it also appears the rating system has changed as well.

				Can someone clarify on how the rating % is calculated now if it has changed. Im guessing it is just a percentage out of the number of transactions and how many stars were given...

				the only visible changes at the moment are that the fan count is gone and the vendor rank is calculated differently.&nbsp; the fan count was too revealing of a vendor&#039;s size, so we took it out, but the vendors themselves can still see it.
