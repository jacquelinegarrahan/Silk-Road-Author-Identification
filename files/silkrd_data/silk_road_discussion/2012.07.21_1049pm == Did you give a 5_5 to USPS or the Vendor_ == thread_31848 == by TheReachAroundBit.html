				If I just read the purchase comments I would think vendors are solely in the shipping business. &quot;shipping was great. got here is 2 days. 5/5!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oh, really?&nbsp; <br /><br />What. About. The. Actual. Product.&nbsp; <br /><br />Could you be bothered to rate that too? Where else do you see such nonsense?&nbsp; <br />I can&#039;t tell if you&#039;re rating the vendor or the postal service!&nbsp; I mean, fine, comment on the packaging and speed, that&#039;s good info to have but, dear God please, please don&#039;t let that be the meat and potatoes of your comment.<br /><br />Example of a helpful comment: &quot;Product was actually dandruff flakes fused together with cum and urine but they got it to me real quick like and they were sooooooo professional bro. 5/5! Who wants to get high?....Whoaaaa&quot;

				I agree with you all. Also can people please actually update their damn feedback after trying the products?<br /><br />I see so many feedback like this &quot;5/5 the packaging and shipping was so discreet and fast! Will update after trying.&quot; 21 Days ago......-____

				I think it all depends on the products and how many feedback&#039;s they already have. <br /><br />If there has already been 20+ feedback&#039;s about the product on how legit it is ect...then all that matters is how fast the vendor got the product out and to that person. There is no need for them to &quot;review&quot; the product. Now again this would all depend on the product.<br /><br />Like in my case I only sell Rx.. And because it never changes, no one ever needs to review the product. What they care about is how fast I responded to messages, how long it took me to mark in transit and how many days it took them&nbsp; to get the product. That really is all that matters.<br /><br />In fact people get mad that there are long &quot;reviews&quot; left about the product!<br /><br />So though I totally see your point I think it all depends on the product.<br /><br />Though I still think the best feedback is when people take the time to break it down like this:<br /><br />Excellent Vendor<br />Excellent Communication<br />Fast Shipping<br />And product as described <br /><br /><br />Though this is great too:<br /><br />Holy shit!!!<br /><br />I was in a bit of a bind. Leaving on a trip on Saturday, and another vendor had been sitting on my order for 5 days.<br /><br />I placed an express order with RxKing around noon with a message about my situation; he wrote back within 15 minutes to say that I could relax because the package would be in my hands shortly. 30 min after that, it was marked as shipped.<br /><br />I know USPS express isn&#039;t guaranteeing overnight anymore, so I was mentally prepared to be in pain for a week. But lo! There it was the next afternoon. Yes!! This is like 23 hours from pressing the order button.<br /><br />Packaging was great, and when I finally got to the goodies inside all the protection... a bonus! So amazing.<br /><br />Overall, quite a delightful experience, definitely went out of his way to save the day. I will be capitalizing the &#039;K&#039; in King from now on.<br /><br />**************************************************************************************<br />Yes that was someones feedback.<br /><br />Bottom line is in this community the feedback is always going to be erratic. I have some feedback where they admit they are high as shit and nothing they are writing makes any sense. Then someone will say: <br /><br />&quot; I saw that feedback that guy left that&nbsp; made no sense..he was totally fucked up..So I went ahead and placed an order... I want to feel like him:) &quot;<br /><br />You have to love the road!<br />&nbsp;;D

				I agree that there are definitely too many worthless reviews and more people, but the total shipping time is pretty important to most people. All of those reviews that tell me how long it took to get there give me an idea of how quickly a vendor will process and send out my order.

				RX King your lucky as you deal in pharms or RCs that are always the same.<br /><br />Trouble is some products, coke, heroin, speed all need reviews because quality does matter! Especially with coke! I mean that shit is Â£100 a gram. I thank the God a small amount does me and a gram would last me a year if not for my missus is onto me being onto SR. She was going to set an account but as a man I feel obliged to take any rap for any possible mishaps!<br /><br />As for the 5/5 thing. I don&#039;t really mark the amount of time. Vendors I use some are busy but I&#039;m a small buyer so do not mind waiting as lets face it the person getting bulk and repeat customers buying fair bit need to be looked atfer. However when I have had to wait I get extra! Main thing is quality. There have been the odd times when I have been aleft feeling disappointed that things never came Friday or Sat! But I go out and drink and sneak a sly joint outside. <br /><br />But, the drugs I really liked I swooped on some of the top batches if MDMA off 6 different vendors. One delayed a while so extra pill (it was an order of 2 defqons) I waited on 5 grams off PF when he always had top line MDMA. Kept that for future events and times I might think &#039;lets roll tonight&#039;<br /><br />I read some moans about posting time but unless you get some next day delivery off a courier or postal services then I think you ought to wait 2 weeks before the PM is sent. You can wait two weeks or more on Amazon!<br /><br />Quality is king for me - I&#039;d sooner wait 3 weeks for quality than 2 days for shit. That said I do like the idea of the idea of maybe just having a surprise weekend party and being able to get some coke ordered Monday from mainland ?Europe to the UK in 3 days, 4 tops. Everytime.<br /><br />Some UK vendors take 2 weeks but always remember me and add extra and pm an apology without prompting. Some good businessmen people here. They sell quality and will always say when something is less than ideal. Bush weeds, cheap hash. Even cheap coke but although honest why sell shit coke anyhow?<br /><br />Anyhow, some buyers do mark for both time it took, quality and any comms with the vendor. I hate the buyers who say &#039;the coke looks good&#039;. <br /><br />Sio I will mention postage time but vut to the chase and chat quality.

That&#039;s why I said it all depends on the product. And when it comes to coke, weed, H or meth (I&nbsp; just named the big 4, I know there are more like E and others) then you would want the buyers to leave actual product feedback along with vendor feedback. And you being in EU brings a whole other level of needs.<br /><br />One of the worse things is when people leave feedback and say they will update later. And of course they never do.<br />&nbsp;<br />As a vendor the worst feedback is when people send me 20 messages about the product and everything else, they finally order, they pay for over nite shipping, they receive it, then they don&#039;t log into there account for 8 days and when they finally do they say &quot; Sorry, I was high as shit the last week, I just finalized. Can I place another order? I promise I will finalize when I receive the package.&quot;<br /><br />So they got what they needed the next day, yet I had to wait a week to get paid. Again I understand shit happens and it comes with the &quot;job&quot;. But them sending me all those messages and then ordering it over nite makes it 100X worse. And of course it is always a big order never the small ones.<br /><br />Bottom line is&nbsp; this...as a buyer you need to really do your homework. Especially on the big 4. Even then you need to make sure the reviews are for what you are actually going to get and that the vendor didn&#039;t change the listing for say a different ounce of coke yet the reviews are for a coke product he had before.<br /><br />But I think with a little work and time you can get what you need and deal with great vendors. Nothing will ever be perfect in here. Though things are always getting better. If you really think about it..the fact this site works as good as it does is pretty amazing.

				Good feedback should be 1. Product Quality, 2. Punctuality/Vendor Communication, 3. Packaging/Stealth (how good was it, without giving details). While vendors can be judged by transactions, % positive, and time as a vendor, most of the feedback is somewhat worthless.<br /><br />Maybe the new design should incorporate a simple 3-4 button review system where you select 1-5 on the things above, and a small &quot;comments&quot; box with minimal characters.
