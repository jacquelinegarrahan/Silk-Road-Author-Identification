				I have an order I need to finalize on BMR and I forgot the stupid withdraw password. Does anyone know what the requirements for it were (1 uppercase, ___ numbers/letters, etc.)? If anyone knows the requirements it might give me a hint as to what I used. I&#039;ve tried all my usual passwords so I&#039;m guessing it must have had some stupid requirement like an added symbol or something I&#039;m just forgetting about.<br /><br />Thanks for any info! :)

				can&#039;t remember. sign up for a new account to find out. doing that might even jog your memory.<br /><br />you should always make a copy of your details until you are satisfied you remember them. just be very careful how you do this. graffiti it on the underneath of a park bench if you have to.

				Hmm... weird. Something fishy&#039;s going on. I knew I had the right password. I went to the account to try and change it and it worked. Then when I go to use the withdraw password to finalize it keeps telling me it&#039;s wrong, even though it just accepted it in the account settings to change it? I&#039;m positive I&#039;m not getting it confused with my account log in password.... WTF???

				At least 7 characters and they don&#039;t need to have upper and lowercase, just alphanumeric I believe.&nbsp; So, you&#039;re going to want letters and numbers that are at least 7 characters in length and they don&#039;t need to be uP and dOwN.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br />-Trocar<br />trocar@safe-mail.net

I put in a password reset request and signed up for a new account just in case and noticed it had to be at least 6 characters and it couldn&#039;t be the same as your log in.
