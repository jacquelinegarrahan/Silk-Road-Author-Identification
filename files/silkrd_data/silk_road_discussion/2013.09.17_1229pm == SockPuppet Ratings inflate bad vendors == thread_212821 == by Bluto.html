				Since everyone within the marketplace is anonymous and it is very easy to create a new account. -I am convinced that certain Vendors are doing nothing more than inflating their ratings by using sockpuppets. It&#039;s probably possible for LE to create a vendor account and just inflate their own ratings with sockpuppets in order to entrap as many people as possible in some sort of HoneyPot or reverse-sting. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how to combat this -or even if SR cares about ratings inflation. <br /><br />I do know that the Vendors are the ones who are paying for SR -so perhaps there is a desire for SR staff to look the other way.<br />

				We&#039;ve known it&#039;s been happening. That&#039;s what the buyer stats are supposed to help you catch. If you see a bunch of reviews from buyers with 1+ purchases and 1+ vendors, be suspicious.<br />

				I hate to be a gloomy harbinger. <br /><br />If law enforcement was doing this. They could conceivably keep multiple accounts that sample the wares from multiple Sellers that they are attempting to bust. At the same time they could use these buyer accounts to boost the rating of their own reverse sting operations.

				LE has bought from every top tier vendor (and probably many many other) on SR, this is not brand new information.<br /><br />This is why people should avoid the free sample giveaways from supposed new vendors, we know that LE is not allowed to vend drugs but they can open a vendors account and harvest a shit load of buyers details.<br /><br />

				At BMR you often go to a vendors page and under all the praise of how great a vendor they are you&#039;ll see &quot;Feedback Padding&quot; under about ten buyers as they have been buying their own goods.<br /><br />So they seem to know when it is happening a lot smaller site though , maybe it is too big here to find out the same.

				&quot;Yet, companies continue to spend millions of dollars on Advertising. Sometimes they do it for years before they see a ROI.&quot;<br /><br />Do you see any vendor (even the really big ones) around here who would be willing to spend millions - or even thousands - on a dodgy scam like you mentioned? One that, if it were caught by SR, could well see their vending privileges revoked and the destruction of their operation in one fell swoop? Furthermore, a large vendor with a great rep has a long history of high-rated trades. Let&#039;s consider your implied theoretical; a large, reputable vendor who periodically scams buyers. For their phoney sockpuppet ratings to have any impact, they&#039;d have to have left A LOT of them over a long period of time to balance out the negative ratings of the people they&#039;d scammed.&nbsp; The ongoing cost of paying the commission on all those ghost orders would be a lot higher than the proceeds made from scamming buyers. Consider that they could only scam a small fraction of trades - if that number got too large, it would arouse suspicion. The resolution centre would soon notice an unusually high number of trades going into resolution from that vendor. And a large successful vendor would already be making enough coin to not have to worry about skulduggery. <br /><br />Sure, a little guy starting out might try it, but they generally wouldn&#039;t be willing or able to spend the kind of money required to boost their rep dramatically. Easier and cheaper to grow your business organically, and better for your karma, too.<br /><br />Overall, I suspect that the phenomenon of vendors using sockpuppets to boost their ratings exists, but the sharp financial disincentive that results from placing enough phoney orders to make a meaningful difference to a vendor&#039;s rep would make it rare. <br /><br />Dodgy vendors are much more likely to trade legitimately and, when they&#039;ve had enough, pull an FE scam. Nice golden parachute. But someone who wants to make more money on an ongoing basis? Hell, there are plenty of good honest ways to do that here which don&#039;t screw anyone over! Why would they bother? Not to mention the fact that a vendor who behaves in such a way always runs the risk of being caught out by the SR management and having their empire dissolved.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not worth it.<br /><br />Vendor sockpuppets are much more disruptive when they leave bad reviews for their competitors, as opposed to leaving good reviews for the vendor with the hand in the glove.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;You know who would say that? A COP WOULD SAY THAT.&quot;<br /><br />You know who would say that? A PARANOID OBSESSIVE WHO FORGOT TO TAKE THEIR MEDS TODAY WOULD SAY THAT. Plenty of good vendors selling what you need, friend. <br /><br />Listen, bluto. Sorry you got burnt through a dodgy buy. Happens to the best of us. But it&#039;s time to move on, no?<br /><br />Chroot has a point. LE could also bust a vendor, flip them, then use them as puppets. Thus they aren&#039;t directly selling drugs.

				This was a very very very small problem... <br /><br />With the new system in place...it makes it so that if you were to do it...it could be spotted right away.<br /><br />Also for any good vendor it was and still is a total waste of time. As Astor said..it did happen...but it was even easily spotted then. And what they were actually doing is making a listing...then making the price $0 then buying it from schill accounts...then they would re-list the item with a $2k or whatever price...but again this was easily spotted and I do not think that a vendor that fudged his feedback ever really scammed anyone.<br /><br />The biggest problem will and has always been the vendor that is great for a period of time...and then decides to leave...and they get buyers to FE. That is the #1 scam by a mile...and if you follow the advice of every member in here that has been around for more then 4 months and you DO NOT FE..you can not fall to a scam. PERIOD!<br /><br />In the past 6 months or so...SR staff along with members of the community have done a fantastic job of catching these scumbags.<br /><br /><br />The bottom line is you have to use common sense. And if you do, you choose a vendor with a great rep...and you do not FE....YOU will&nbsp; have a great experience on SR and you will not get scammed.<br /><br /><br />Vendors padding their feedback...has never been a problem on the road. Stupid buyers has been the problem on the road. And some really smart buyers that made stupid mistakes.<br /><br />DO NOT FE!!!!

As far as it being a &quot;dodgy scam&quot; -it&#039;s no more so than when Tiger Woods stands up and says that he wears Reebocks or tells us that we can be sexual dynamos by using Viagra. It&#039;s called advertising. In fact if a successful vendor ISN&#039;T doing this then I&#039;d be surprised. I&#039;m sorry if you disagree, but this is how business is run.<br /><br />Also the idea that someone is using a sockpuppet to bring down their competitors is only feasible if there are a few competitors. It&#039;s kind of like those commercials where Tide compares themselves to Gain. Well, I use Dreft so those commercials don&#039;t apply to me. On the other hand there are only a handful of gasoline companies -so I might be persuaded to by gasoline from Exxon vs Chevron. (This assumes that I care and just don&#039;t go to the most convenient place.)<br /><br />As far as being a PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC -I&#039;m a realist. Although, meds like LSD, MDMA and 2C-B help with this -their effects are only temporary (until the Government starts up their SECRET BRAIN RAY DEVICE again.)<br /><br />

The ATF was selling illegal high-capacity guns to Mexican drug lords. Clearly a legal violation, but they did it anyway. How is selling drugs that far removed from Fast and Furious? You really think they draw a moral line at drugs, yet they&#039;ll go undercover and sell CP, guns, and fake IDs?<br /><br />I&#039;d bet anything LE has multiple vendor accounts on SR and use them as tool to gather information and stay in the loop.

The NSA is doing a lot of illegal shit. But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s standard practice for drug investigations. Distributing drugs carries a big liability, if people overdose and die. In all of the CDs I&#039;ve heard about, they make sure to bust the person before he can get away or consume the drugs, and in sting operations they often use fake drugs. Purdue Pharma makes blank OC80&#039;s. They look just like the real thing, since they are made in the same presses, but contain no oxycodone. They provide these blanks as a &quot;service&quot; to LE and the community, to stop prescription drug abuse.<br /><br />LE will allow drug dealers to operate for months while conducting an investigation, because in that case the dealer carries the liability if someone is harmed. There&#039;s a difference between allowing someone to distribute drugs and distributing the drugs yourself. More importantly, I have never heard of a case where someone received real drugs from LE and was allowed to keep them, consume them, etc., and only later got busted. If anyone has evidence this happened, that an actual LE agent distributed real drugs, and not just a drug dealer under investigation, I&#039;d love to see it.<br />

There is a really good docco called last great white hope (I think that&#039;s the correct name) that covers this issue, in 1996 Gary Webb wrote a series of articles published in the San Jose Mercury News, which investigated Nicaraguans linked to the CIA-backed Contras who had smuggled cocaine into the U.S. which was then distributed as crack cocaine into Los Angeles and funneled profits to the Contras. <br /><br />CIA Director John M. Deutch went to Los Angeles to attempt to refute the allegations raised by the Webb articles, and was famously confronted by former Los Angeles Police Department officer Michael Ruppert, who testified that he had witnessed it occurring. It is one of the best moments where someone is called out in the most public way and has nothing to come back with.<br /><br />Yes I got some of that from Wikipedia but watch the docco, it&#039;s very good.

				&quot;Again, a properly run business isn&#039;t as desperate for early sales as you think. &quot;<br /><br />It would seem you have little idea what I think. I know what you think, though - it&#039;s all there in your OP. My point was that the phenomenon you mention of vendors using sockpuppets to boost their reps could only ever have a fairly minor impact on the ratings of those vendors.<br /><br />&quot;As far as it being a &quot;dodgy scam&quot; -it&#039;s no more so than when Tiger Woods stands up and says that he wears Reebocks or tells us that we can be sexual dynamos by using Viagra.&quot;<br /><br />Um, no, actually the sockpuppet thing you suggested is not at all like celebrity product endorsement, and is a lot less ethical. A closer equivalent to what you described would be if Tiger Woods secretly training a bunch of golfers and then stuffing the Masters with them so that he was only ever competing against his ring-ins which he controlled, and they always made sure they lost and he won, boosting his ranking. Everyone watching his games thought they were witnessing a fair game of golf, but Woods&#039;s rankings had been artificially boosted by the actions of his own agents (sockpuppets, if you will). That&#039;s a much better analogy.<br /><br />&quot;In fact if a successful vendor ISN&#039;T doing this then I&#039;d be surprised. I&#039;m sorry if you disagree, but this is how business is run.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t get it. If you&#039;re all fine and dandy with this, why on earth start a ranty thread about how terrible it is? Make your mind up.<br /><br />&quot;Also the idea that someone is using a sockpuppet to bring down their competitors is only feasible if there are a few competitors.&quot;<br /><br />Um, well I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve noticed, but there are a few competitors, and then some. Let&#039;s say you are a top 5% vendor with heaps of positive stats, and suddenly you start facing stiff competition from another vendor. You have a brilliant idea to set up a sockpuppet account (or five) to do your bidding. What would be the most effective way to use your sockpuppet(s)? Get them to boost your own ratings by 0.0001% (an extra drop of five star praise in an ocean of the stuff) or purchase from your competitor, then lay a few turds in their punchbowl of four and five star feedback?&nbsp; <br /><br />Seems pretty obvious to me.

To be honest with relation to the crew of the Gulfstream II N987SA the Mexican Government is being pretty damn silent.&quot;<br /><br />Yeah, so I wonder if they were CIA agents or civilians. Probably civilians.<br /><br />Do you think the CIA is dumb enough to ship drugs with its own planes. and have CIA agents piloting them? They know there is a small but real possibility that they could crash or other things could go wrong. Seems to me even if they were involved in drug smuggling, they&#039;d do it with people and planes that didn&#039;t make it so obvious.<br /><br />The article says the plane was &quot;linked to rendition flights&quot;, but what&#039;s the evidence?<br /><br />An alternative explanation is that a drug smuggling organization bought or rented a plane linked to the CIA for the lulz. :)<br />

Or, maybe the 2,900 Kilos was estimated to be 32 tons after the pure blow was cut by the CIA. Or maybe the 32 tons was really 3.2 tons (but they did not put a decimal in the webpage address) and I just like to imagine stuff :-) Thinking about having thousands of Kilos of jungle-fresh blow has me a little overenthusiastic about this post, lol.

				I reckon a B-52 could swallow 32 tonnes. Just. Although I don&#039;t think the Pentagon would be all that keen on loaning one to the CIA. Can you blame them?
