				Dude give it a rest. Think about how hard and lonely DPR is running this site. Sure maybe he has a few close, close people he works with whom he trusts, but imagine how lonely it&#039;s got to be when someone tries to hack the site or it is attacked. He and his close group are the only ones who can defend it. It isn&#039;t as if he can just go out and hire new people without being unbelievably cautious.

However dpr makes piles of money running sr, so theres no excuse for it to be down numnerous times for weeks. He needs to get his shit together.

				SRfailure<br />I don&#039;t think DPR is not trying hard. Besides that you wouldn&#039;t be able to develop and maintain such site for any money, and I think 100% of those who complaining wouldn&#039;t also. So why do you complain? Maybe you know better anonymous market? Oh, I&#039;d love to see it. <br />

Really, say how he should use the money to make this site better.

				Glad I&#039;m not the only one, not whinging just thought my account might have been compromised and my password changed. Glad it wasn&#039;t :)<br /><br />Just keep your coins in your own wallet and enjoy the fruits of this lovely site, it wouldn&#039;t be easy and I for one appreciate the efforts of DPR! Thank you DPR, will donate once I&#039;m back in and able too :)<br /><br />Stop whinging it just breeds negativity and could put DPR off from running this show, how much would you fucking whinge then?

				You guys don&#039;t understand, DPR doesn&#039;t give a single shit about you guys, he gives a shit about your money. He&#039;s not going to sit idly by and let his income die, stop fucking crying out loud every-time there is a little downtime, most logical vendors keep large amounts of BTC out of silk road and inside there own personal BTC wallet, so it&#039;s not like DPR is looking to take vendors money, or even the consumers money. He wants the website up fifty times more then you want it back up because it&#039;s his job. He will fix it, if it takes 24 hours or 24 days, settle down, smoke a fat joint and delete your silk road forum profile cause I don&#039;t wanna hear your shit about LE running SR or hackers stealing our account info.

Honestly I was worried the site got compromised and my PW was stolen, but I&#039;ve seen this before...it&#039;s just a hiccup or they are making some changes and don&#039;t want to let attackers or whomever know that they are doing maintenance.

Back when SR first started it was A LOT slower.<br /><br />&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s quite time to be shitting all over DPR quite yet, I think we should be supportive and understanding given this shit is all underground and ILLEGAL they do a pretty good job. I don&#039;t see anyone going over to &quot;The Black Market&quot; That sites up all the fucking time lol<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;d say use this as a test to see how prepared you are to continue either selling or buying if SR were to go away. Have your list of sellers and buyers.

				If it comes up it does not mean its not compromised either. The issue here is that DPR hasn&#039;t said a fucking word about what is going on apart from vague bland statements.<br />You can keep on pretending that nothing bad is happening but evidence suggests that things are afoot in the background that you are not being told about. Nope obviously nothing keep putting your money in folks nothing bad is going on here. Maybe some acknowledgement of the hacker bullshit would put DPR in better credibility.

				Its a shame things like this happen but its such a two sided coin so to speak. Yes DPR assuredly works his ass off and you cannot knock A, Him or B, His team for number one founding this site and number two maintaining it but what this site has grown into is beyond us all. <br /><br />I think all those senior members who are quick to throw stones and label those concerned as &quot;junkies&quot; need to seriously remember that this is a community. You have young and old members and just because youve been with it from the start cannot out weigh the concerns of what is a large percentage of active members. <br /><br />We haven&#039;t received an official announcement and for all we know the server might be getting upgraded or heaven forbid the site is compromised. I think times like this requires a little more understanding from all and it is more than understandable that some members are angry as not even a two second post by admins can be given to calm the community. Many members turn helter skelter thinking the end of silk is nigh but you should still keep your whits about you... &quot;Fear is just another word for Ignorance&quot; to quote the famous Hunter S Thompson. But dismissing every event that Silk goes down as &quot;it will be right back up/everything is fine&quot; is also just plain ignorance... <br /><br />I feel sorry for all those Vendors and Members which have money, items, custom listings, BTCs etc all messed up by this downtime. Without Silk there would be no members and with out members no silk. This community has grown to the point that it supports full time vendors who rely on this site as a source of income and times like these puts them at risk. If shit hits the fan and silk crashed what does DPR or the admin team owe to anyone? Nothing at all. Its a very possible scenario that silk dies and the money is gone with it. <br /><br />So its a two sided argument and i think its best at times like these to just keep our heads, stay smart and support the community. Don&#039;t go to either extremes in these times when no official announcement has been made. But also a bit of understanding to those in the community that have money and time at steak.

				Guys relax. This site goes days on days without any error but the moment something is slightly wrong you guys jump to conclusions? Relax man. It&#039;s been stated that the demand for SR has gone up dramatically and it&#039;s caused massive strain on the servers. How about giving some praise to DPR and the crew for keeping a place like this up against everything that&#039;s been thrown at them instead of wining the moment something goes wrong? Some of you are in your current situation BECAUSE of this place. Be grateful. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a lot of behind-the-scenes work and that there&#039;s a lot of time being spent on making sure this place is good.<br /><br />TL;DR.<br /><br />Chill.

				Didn&#039;t some forum user just state he Ddos&#039;d btkoin.com? Maybe<br />this was their payback....LOL scammers revenge!<br /><br />No seriously, how come so many people switching from love to hate for DPR depending on wether the site is up or down? o.O<br /><br />I think if you don&#039;t like the way he <br />handles stuff on here, feel free to leave and buy your drugs elswhere.<br /><br />All these negative posts are messing up my mood:-(

We will get the site back up asap. Thank you for your patience.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Hoping this will be a quick fix.
