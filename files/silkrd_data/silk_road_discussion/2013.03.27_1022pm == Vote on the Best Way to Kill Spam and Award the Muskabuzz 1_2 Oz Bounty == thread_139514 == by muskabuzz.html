				&nbsp;I would say user up and down votes, But we already have neg karma and positive karma so what i mean by the up / down votes is that If you fall below &quot;x&quot; amount of negative votes you require a moderator to re-allow you to use the road. <br />That also prevents anybody just negging somebody&#039;s posts because a mod would see they are not a spammer and allow them to use SR again. <br />if we all stick together and neg vote a spammer every time you see one they will be permanently banned. (this could be done via I.p&#039;s or many other methods to help keep it permanent) <br />could you make that a bit more clear please in the poll section =) Cheers Muska

				The best way to deter the spammer is to make it not profitable to bother spamming the forum. The way to do this is to keep idiots from using the spammers service (sticky topics, etc). Given that you can&#039;t stop idiots from being idiots, the second best option is to block posts containing certain urls and other specific keywords, so that&#039;s what I voted for.

				I voted for up/down voting. This is how I think it could work well:<br /><br />Any user can up or down vote any post (note this is different than karma, which is attached to a user instead of being attached to a post only). Ideally we should be able to do this from the forum topic homepage, so that we don&#039;t have to click on a spammy post when we see one in order to downvote. Now the mods can see a realtime list of threads/posts with the most downvotes, and these will probably be all spam.<br /><br />Of course, just having more mods around definitely wouldn&#039;t hurt either. Maybe we could raise new mods whose power/responsibility is limited to acting on downvoted posts only.<br /><br />I&#039;m not much of a technical guy, but it seems like any automatated/scripted defenses would be really, really hard to develop and implement... or else I wouldn&#039;t still be getting two or three spam posts a dead on my dead blogger pages, right? Crowd source that shit

				I&nbsp; love the idea of someone who is good at hacking and who can sabotage www.bitswing.com and make them regret ever becoming a website. Seriously, fuck that website and their spammers. They aren&#039;t even legit, they deserve to be fucked with.

				Paid (or honorary) mods is the only way to do this.&nbsp; You can&#039;t limit the threads per minute with IP since everyone uses the same exit nodes.&nbsp; You could limit it according to username, and the 50 post limit sandbox REALLY helps this, but somebody will find a way to spam through those quickly at some point.<br /><br />That sandbox is doing a good job and is about the best automated system we could have.&nbsp; Spam on the regular boards has dropped quite a lot since it was implemented.&nbsp; Almost anything else will just be a band-aid and this forum kind of needs a full-time mod who is on the switch 24/7.&nbsp; This community is getting huge and when people are getting duped into sending money to con men we hold a responsibility to keep them safe within our walls.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that the site can let $20/hr or so go to a trustworthy admin who keeps this forum clean.<br /><br />Nice plan though Muska!&nbsp; Thanks for taking some effort to make this a better place for all!
