				As long as you&#039;re actually studying and free from all possible distractions, Adderall is fine. I&#039;ve been taking 20mgs daily, if not twice daily depending on the day. Don&#039;t forget to eat and take occasional breaks.<br /><br />Be careful though, you may plan to check Facebook for a couple minutes, but you may find yourself with 12 tabs open and realize you&#039;ve been reading random articles on Wikipedia for the last 30 minutes.<br /><br />Best of luck, <br />sdesu

				You basically have a few to choose from - adderall, ritalin, modafinil and caffeine.<br /><br />It depends on you which one works best. For me adderall is too recreational (I end up doing nothing but smoking and chatting), modafinil makes me feel weird and constant caffeine use since childhood has rendered me immune to it&#039;s positive effects.<br /><br />So I would use ritalin for studying because its stimulating but not enjoyable. <br /><br />But I would recommend not using drugs to study, I used to and my grades improved very, very dramatically when I stopped. Use them for crazy weekends instead :D

				You can try......&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Tiny doses no larger than 20mg maybe but who would want to waste such a beautiful drug on something as lame as studying?&nbsp; ::)

You can make this yourself using common materials found only in your own home, all you need is :<br /><br />- A functioning brain<br />- Your textbooks and course work<br />- A pen and note paper<br />- A quiet room<br />- A chair and table or desk<br /><br />Mix these in equal amounts.<br /><br />Make sure you apply Reveeson liberally at least once a day. You&#039;ll find Reveeson is most beneficial when applied for longer periods just before bed (2-3 hours).<br /><br />Side effects include:<br /><br />Increased grades<br />Better work life balance<br />Heightened numbers of qualifications<br /><br />Enjoy as part of a healthy diet and active lifestyle. :-)<br /><br />V.

				adderall is probably the best but dont take too much or let yourself get distracted on small things like fb. ritalin, vivance, etc work about as well. Ive heard good things about modafinil

				adderall can backfire on you though, so just be aware of that. i don&#039;t have ADD so if i take adderall i&#039;m all over the place for the next few hours.&nbsp; It helps me do physical labor work, but i can&#039;t study at all on any of those drugs, i just get way too distracted

				Modafinil worked good for me, 150 hours of physics in 1Â½ week with no problem, also gotta recommend Coherence, one of my favorite sellers on the site - 2nd and 3rd order came with 20-40% extra and always very fast shipping :)

				I&#039;m assuming most of the people above didn&#039;t know how to take adderall for studying. I use to do it ALL THE TIME and it worked amazingly. The thing is, don&#039;t take like 50 mg, taking that much would be in situations where you would want to have fun. What I use to do is take a 10 MG IR pill and that would help me focus greatly. You have to sit in a quiet place and obviously get rid of all distractions and you can just sit there reading a book for hours upon hours and enjoy it.

				I use to use opiates to study hard.<br /><br />I&#039;d take them the night before whatever was due and stay up all night writing and drinking. Usually I&#039;d do pretty well if it was a written task, but ohhhh boy, if it was a presentation... I would need a very stiff drink before I did it.<br /><br />Stimulants hiner my concentration more than they help it.

				I personally like 4-FA, it is still uncontrolled in most places so it should be easier and cheaper to get than d-amphetamine.

				Personally I just keep a good sativa on hand to keep me from getting bored from studying one thing too long. Has to be clear headed though or all my study time is (pretty much) wasted.
