				Just got this message from two different UK vendors asking if I know this guy and If I could help forward this to other vendors, they got the message from a user named, Simonclark81 ,anyone else get this? -<br /><br />Hi, I&#039;m not sure if you are the right person or not, but I live near to you and have noticed you making quite a few deliveries to the mailbox, some of which I managed to get on video... search for &#039;silk road local delivery&#039; on (clearnet url removed) and click on the the first video and you will be able to see.<br /><br />This is not a threat, I am just trying to pre warning you to be more careful when mailing things. (and maybe send someone else to the mailbox instead of yourself) Although I wouldn&#039;t say no to a free sample :)<br /><br />P.S If it is not you in the video, then you can ignore this<br /><br />Simon<br /><br />He does say its no threat and asks for samples.. but what if its LE sending it to every vendor so they click a clearnet link? Please consider this before clicking the link I havnt watched the video nobody has yet for those reasons. I removed the clearnet url in case it does expose anyone so I will share the link only with trusted forum users to verify if there is proof of someone messing up etc.. I am trying to keep security for the whole community safe on this one. <br /><br />What do you guys make of this?? Petty scam? would he really message every SR seller in the UK for the chance of a sample or for them to panic and offer him money? At the end of the day he states he has some of it on video.. i dont know if he uploaded it or not or just saw it and realized he lived near there.. he honestly could just be warning people but surprised he wud make his own private videos on private message people rather than contact staff. <br /><br />Guidance needed please. Also wasnt sure whether to add this to the security part of the forums or not as I dont really understand the situation. <br />

				Are these messages going to only UK vendors, or only people in the UK? That would be an important fact.<br />

				Until this gets spread properly please keep all threads running we need as much of the community to know about this as possible. This is global LE attack method. They confirm you from you clicking on the URL then they got ur location and all its gona take is a couple orders till they get closer and closer to u, very very dangerous.

				This is an attempt by somebody (possibly LE) to de-anonymise people through the use of JavaScript. Absolutely do NOT click on that link!!!<br /><br />Libertas
