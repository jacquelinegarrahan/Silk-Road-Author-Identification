				I have some 00 here but not off jor its a sativa but very very heavy once it settles you just cant move from your chair (maybe some indica?), would you say the fez was a good night time smoke or is it more an active high what I do not want is a high similar to Moroccan caramela hash as this is to intense on the mind for me I like a balance of mind and body?

				it is similar to caramello, if you want a good hash for a body high his manali is very nice,&nbsp; afghan black gives you a good sleep too. you&#039;re best going for indian and afghan for a couch lock effect.

				I think it&#039;s probably the best hash I&#039;ve ever had after 10 years of weed. I&#039;ve been having bongs of it all week. It&#039;s delicious, and gets me very stoned. I&#039;d recommend it!
