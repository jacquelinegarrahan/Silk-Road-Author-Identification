				Linux - which one? Never really got into it, but was just wondering which one would pretty much come close to to the Windows/MAC GUI? <br /><br /><br />Also, compatible for TrueCrypt FDE?<br /><br /><br />Any help is appreciated.

				You are right, the Pear does come very close...<br /><br /><br />As for the Windows(ish) it seems Zorin OS.<br /><br /><br />Now would any mind to give a simple overview into the difference between for example Zorin or Pear? Or Ubuntu? Sorry guys, a bit noob when it comes to Linux....<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br />M

				Liberte is great for this kind of place, but is so restricted it&#039;s useless for more legitimate things so not so great as an all-the-time replacement for windows/OSX. Personally, I prefer lightweight Linux distros like Bodhi Linux. A good list here:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Linux_distribution<br /><br />Ubuntu is probably easiest to pick up as a new-to-linux distro, and has really good and extensive support. Plus, despite it&#039;s downsides (overly animated and &#039;flashy&#039;, some crap new features, heavy), it has an awesome philosophy: It is named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, &quot;human-ness&quot;), which often is translated as &quot;humanity towards others&quot; or &quot;the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity&quot; and the guy who originally financed it is an African millionaire who&#039;s aim was to create a linux distro to challenge windows/Apple but that was free, since software licenses are a real drain on startups in Africa and other developing areas. <br /><br />Anyhow, I found this article which looks to be a pretty fair overview and is definitely a good starting point. Try summink out, if you don&#039;t like it try summink else - they&#039;re all free!<br /><br />http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/708977-the-2013-top-7-best-linux-distributions-for-you<br /><br />

				You should also have a look here:<br /><br />clearnet: prism-break.org<br /><br />It seems that Ubuntu is not recommended due to data leaks.<br /><br />Both Pear and Zorin are Ubuntu based.

				Try playing around with any flavor of BSD FreeBSD/OpenBSD/DragonflyBSD or Centos/Fedora/Redhat in a VM

				Ok I appreciate the input guys, time to make up mind soon.<br /><br /><br />Ideally, what I want to do...<br /><br /><br />Use a fresh computer for SR only. That means, best type of OS and and the usual encryption stuff. I understand some basics, and Tails would come after. But knowing what I would need it for, which OS is best recommended in this case. Bearing in mind, a Linux-noob will be using it :)<br /><br /><br />M
