				im kinda glad SR has went down, iv never laughed so much in my life, for the 1st time in months iv never seen so many new members, and random BS conspiracy theories likewise, its giggles per min the longer it goes on...<br /><br />it just shows all of us how fragile SR really is, and will keep alot more guys on their toes regarding their SR wallets, id be pretty pissed myself tbh but i have learned not to keep all my eggs in one basket, just incase some unforeseen problem like this arrises, i was talking to vendor about this very situation about a month ago, and here we go, shit happens folks...<br /><br />heres hoping things are all sorted soon, before theres a man hunt for DPR or should i say Tony76... Only Jesting (before u conspiritors have a fit)&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />long live SR, n keep the BS rolling guys, its keeping me in laughs untill SR get up and going again...

				Defiantly true. Been on SR for awhile now but never bothered to join the community. Events like this bring us all closer together as we see how much this place really means to us ! Planning on making a vendor account in the next few months once stock is built up &amp; now I have gotten the idea to introduce myself on here &amp; touch base with all you guys before upgrading my account, Good always comes from the bad lets just hope the site is back up stronger than ever &amp; puts all the rumors to rest.
