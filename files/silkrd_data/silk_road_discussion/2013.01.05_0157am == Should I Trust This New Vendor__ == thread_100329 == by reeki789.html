				i would say just to shoot them a few messages to get an idea of the vendor&#039;s character, obviously it isn&#039;t fool proof, you&#039;ll have to use some judgement.<br /><br />On top of that, isn&#039;t it something like $475 to purchase a vendor account now?&nbsp; I doubt this person would spend that much to rip you off on their first order, especially when nearly all their listings are significantly less than $475.<br /><br />Give it a shot I&#039;d say.

				Sometimes it pays to take a chance on a new vendor.&nbsp; But of course you should trust no one.&nbsp; No need to trust a vendor to do business with him.&nbsp; If you like what you see, go for it, but keep it in escrow.

				New vendors often have the best deals, and the beauty of escrow is that you don&#039;t have to trust them :)<br />I often try out new vendors, they are usually eager to impress you with their wares and service, though you do take a chance with unproven stealth shipping.
