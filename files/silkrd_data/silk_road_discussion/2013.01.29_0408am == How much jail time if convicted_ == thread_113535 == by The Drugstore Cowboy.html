				Before I go into vending I would like to know what I&#039;m facing if&nbsp; I get nabbed. I realize it is highly unlikely if you are smart about your security but I can&#039;t help but think about getting 10 years in prison or some crazy shit like that.<br /><br />I live in Australia. I would be a first time offender. So lets say I got convicted with 10-50 grams of MDMA. And for an extreme lets say I was being monitored on the SR somehow and they had a few weeks of evidence of supply 30-50 gs (a week) of MDMA or Ketamine (I would think it would be almost impossible to convict someone of this unless they had full access to the site and could somehow find out my I.D) would I be fucked?<br /><br />I&#039;m in my early 20&#039;s. I&#039;m not a street thug or hardened criminal, but I&#039;m strong willed. I can&#039;t do this if its some crazy amount of jail time, I&#039;m willing to risk a year or 2 of imprisonment if that would be an extreme conviction which sounds crazy but I&#039;m between a rock and a hard place in my life right now and I&#039;m very confident I can pull this off. Not confident enough to not look into the consequences :P But one would think its the smart thing to do anyways.<br /><br />If someone who knows anything about this stuff could chime in I would be very grateful.

				anything you do across state borders in the USA is a Federal offense... anything to do with the USmail is a federal offense.... EVERYTHING on the road is a federal offense.<br /><br />pretty sure Australia is harsher

				It&#039;s just not that simple. There are SO many factors that decide a sentence. Would it be your first offense? Will the police break the law in a way you can prove in court? Will the jurors be sympathetic? (Probably not.) Are you white? Are you well-off? Well-connected? If a ten year sentence is something you can&#039;t stomach then maybe dealing across international lines (or at all, really) isn&#039;t for you. It sure as hell isn&#039;t my cup of meat. Sure the money is good, but if you get caught you can kiss it all goodbye, plus however many years of your life.

				I know this isn&#039;t relevant to Australia, and I&#039;d gladly give you some insight about your situation if I had any at all whatsoever to give (clueless about your neck of the woods), but for anybody who clicks the thread looking for US possession charges: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53177.0#msg522023

				You have to weigh out the good and the bad bro. By dealing on here and through the Mail as someone said is FEDERAL. If you get convicted Federally its diffrent than state, State if u got 10 year non violent youd be out in 5 or so, but Fed time you get 10 years thats what your doing last i check..DAY FOR DAY! NO GOOD TIME.<br /><br />I would suggest just because you had to ask this question your not cut out for this. Iv been to prison (State) i served 11mnths which was nothing and went by Fast but this is a whole new ball game when were talking Fed time 10+ years. <br /><br />Why dont you get a small crew together and have them be the sellers for you and if you have the connect give it out to be sold, instead of sending through the mail and all the factors that play into this. 11mnths was enough for me like i said im in USA and its nothing like they show on TV if your not a fucking child killer,rapper or shit like tht.. <br /><br />Iv thought about vending on here also bro, bud im trying to change my life in allot of ways and doing this would just be something in the back of my head worried 24/7 when their gonna kick it down.. I stayed on the run almost 2 years and i had 2 cameras set at my house so i could see whoever it was that drove though, its a Great life while things r going good and money is flowing, but bro think all the money u make, when you get busted, Most is gonna go to a lawyer and court fee&#039;s AND DONT DARE NOT HAVE A LAWYER ON SPEED DIAL WITH THIS SHIT..<br /><br />When i was 18 though 24 i sold Pills daily i had a huge amount of access each month and 100% profit, but i got tipped off from someone who knows someone up high if i kept it up they were coming an coming hard. So i fell back ,stop selling weed and all..<br /><br />Im in a small town and I was the only white guy selling so it made it obvious when all the normal people who went to the Hood were meeting me or in my front yard it was clear what was up.<br />I had a good 5 half year run and made good money though, lived it up and i actully did a smart thing before i got a habit of having to do much more of my pills then i should have been i invested the money i had left into some stock and it paid off and still is..<br /><br />So the moral is FAST COME EASY GO.. SOON AS THAT JAIL DOOR SLAMS BEHIND YOU AND YOU KNOW YOUR NOT GOING HOME NO MORE AND CANT HUG YOUR WIFE AND SEE YOU CHILD YOU REALIZE FAST &#039;I FUCKED UP&#039; THIS IS IMHO BRO..<br /><br />I could make a couple grand a month on here with the meds i get prescribed. But like i said iv decided to go back to college and do something with myself other than just be known as a drug dealer/user and ex felon..

				I really should of mentioned I would only be selling domestically. Yes, first time offender. I&#039;m not well off in the sense that I have money, I have like 1k to my name.<br /><br />I do indeed realize a lot of factors effect a sentence but no doubt there is min or max number of years for something. <br /><br />+1 to you if I could AA. I&#039;ve tried university. Really wasn&#039;t for me. I feel like I will be giving this a try no matter what. I&#039;m in a tough situation at the moment and getting caught and doing some time really wouldn&#039;t make it much worse. I just want to know what kind of scope we&#039;re looking at here...<br /><br />Anyone who knows criminal law? Or is nifty with Australian crime?

				I don&#039;t want to offend but if you have to ask on the forums, you probably shouldn&#039;t try(see: naive).<br /><br />If you are not willing to put in the time to research these things on your own, are you going to put in the time required to do the job well? Will you even know how to do the job well? You haven&#039;t put in time, you are going to do the crime and then you will probably serve time(lame but gets the point across, yes?).<br /><br />Of course, I am not expert on the subject, so take it with a grain of salt.

There are no books to look up in a library or no government internet pages that are going to give me the answers I want. The people of this forum are going to know more about it then anyone else. There are some very educated people of these forums, put the studying of criminal law and a few months buying/selling on SR and reading forums together and that person right there... is the one I want to chat with.<br /><br />You&#039;ve assumed a lot here my friend and to be a frank I&#039;m insulted that you would take such an arrogant high ground. I suspect you&#039;ve purely taken my youth and my oblivious nature on this topic and just gone full retard. You are indeed right, your not an expect on this subject, in fact you didn&#039;t offer up any knowledge at all. I&#039;ve already looked into it and turned up very little. I&#039;ve spent 4-6 hours doing my research every day since I found SR and will continue to do so until I know almost every piece of information there is to know about security and vending. I would say its reached the point of being obsessive even. So please next time you come across vulnerability do not use it to elevate, either don&#039;t say shit or share what knowledge you have.

I HIT PAYDAY!!<br /><br />1K in cash and a bag full of 80mg OC and Dilaudids ..I think it turned out 100 80mg oc and 200 k4 and k8 dilly...GREAT LICK!!!

I&#039;m really not the type of person. I&#039;m an angry anti social mother fucker (apart from when I&#039;m drinking/rolling). I&#039;m just going to master this and not get in too deep. Keep things to a minimum and take breaks and stuff. I appreciate the advise though brother.

Saying things like &#039;I am willing to take 2 years but couldn&#039;t handle 10&#039; makes me worry that you really have no clue, but hell I am just a retard without basic reasoning skills on the internet.

				You can&#039;t get caught, Nobody knows where you are. <br />If a buyer send his address in gpg he can&#039;t get caught either.<br /><br />Silroad is full proof.<br /><br />Nobody has been caught yet using SR and you are not going to be the first one who will be caught.<br /><br />The one or two that have been caught did lure themselves in to get money from a western union money pick-up.<br /><br />TOR and bitcoin only for sellers.<br />If you are a buyer and use gpg for your address and you can not be caught either.<br /><br />Fullproof !
