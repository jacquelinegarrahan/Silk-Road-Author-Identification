				I expect prices will increase because of greater demand from now through New Years. Holiday parties, increased stress, and too much to do and too little time are reasons or excuses. Vendors might go on vacation too. If you want something in time for a certain event make sure you order far enough in advance. Two weeks is enough to be sure you get it in time. That&#039;s about the longest any of my orders has taken to arrive within the US.

				I think prices could drop, since it&#039;ll be a good opportunity for sellers to pick up a lot new business from the high demand. It&#039;d also help customer loyalty to advertise sales around the holidays and I think that would create more competition between vendors to undercut each other on price (think black friday).<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about business, but I think that makes sense, as long as the supply is there too.

				I don&#039;t think that there will be an overall trend, I think some vendors would keep their prices the same, some would give discounts in honor of the &quot;spirit of christmas&quot; or whatever, and some will surely raise their prices since there would be less supply due to other vendors taking vacations. All we can do is hope that the drugs that we want fall in the discounted category.

It is more about how available and how popular the drug is. Weed is very stable... L, on the other hand, is very volatile. <br /><br />But in any case, I think SR is nice because it has multiple vendors all selling on one site, allowing the consumer a larger degree of choice than he or she would normally have. If anything, this suggests the law of supply and demand will apply for the holidays too. It being that SR isn&#039;t a site that is going to get a lot of holiday sign ups (people know what this is at this point and are here or they aren&#039;t; they&#039;re not going to get into it over the holidays), it is more a case of current users buying drugs for use as gifts. This suggests to me that things like weed and coke are probably going to be discounted, but things like L or K are going to be unchanged or go up. Still, I don&#039;t think anything will go up too much because the rarer drugs are generally the drugs people don&#039;t use over the holidays anyway.

				I would imagine ecstasy would be in high demand for holidays. It is a very socially accepted drug and there are a lot of New years raves going on all over the country.
