				He bought some weed off me. I shipped it.&nbsp; He said he liked it but he really could not afford the weed and asked if he could ship it back because he spent his rent money and he has kids.&nbsp; I told him he could ship it back and choose another strain.&nbsp; He said no he wants cash back, I said ok, ship it back.&nbsp; Once it gets here, I will refund you your coins.&nbsp; <br /><br />He then said NO, give me my coins back first, he does not trust me.&nbsp; I found that funny as I shipped the product that was orders with no issues, why would I not give him a refund?&nbsp; So I told him no.&nbsp; Sorry!&nbsp; You will have to ship it back first. To that he said, give me my money bitch or I am going to F*** up your rating so nobody goes near you. <br /><br />I am not giving in to someone like that.&nbsp; So I told him to goto hell.&nbsp; Now my feedback is screwed up.&nbsp; Do not buy from this guy, he will try to scam or blackmail you.<br /><br />Silk Road should really have a SELLER response to bad reviews.&nbsp; EBAY does, AMAZON does.&nbsp; We get slammed and cannot even defend ourselves. Kind of crazy really.

				Very bad move, for your own safety, to offer a customer on here to send their product back to you.<br /><br />My advice would be to just accept the loss and move on.&nbsp; ;)

				Man If that happened to me I&#039;d be pretty upset to say the least.. Some people out here dont understand how much work vendors put in to keep a good rating...<br /><br />I know I&#039;ll do anything in my power to avoid a situation like that but there should be some way SR can rectify the situation if it arises.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s screwed up, SR support should be able to take care of the feedback for you.<br />I don&#039;t know your security measures, but it doesn&#039;t sound like a good idea to allow buyers to &quot;send things back&quot; either since the vac. seal will be opened, the packaging could look highly suspicious and they now have a physical address to tie you with and expect you to arrive at in case of LE

				Yeah your right, I should not accept returns anyway.&nbsp; I was just shocked by what he was saying and did not want a bad feedback by this guy.&nbsp; Then it became clear he wanted the weed and the money.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />SR does not fix situations like this.&nbsp; They say it will drown out with other good feedback.&nbsp; Problem is this may have a big impact on me for awhile

				Ugh, I&#039;ve seen this happened before and it&#039;s sad that people can&#039;t accept the fact that they have to pay for what they got. -.- I thought this was common sense. Oh, and also, do not accept returns... That way the buyers can get YOUR address and LEO will come knock on YOUR door. &lt;.&lt; <br /><br />All the best when vending.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				There&#039;s just one thing I don&#039;t understand. If he made the purchase off your account, then his money would be held in escrow, right? Then all you would have to do is let it auto-finalize or he would have to take it to resolution. All you would have to do is prove that it was delivered, or show SR support the messages saying that he received, but he just doesn&#039;t want to release it because the dumbass is bought something he can&#039;t afford.

				dude you should NEVER allow product to be shipped back to you. it sounds like this guy is just a fucking moron but its not good practice<br /><br />if he was LE (god forbid), he would now have everything he needs to bust you, or pass on info for LE in your area to bust you. that was an extremely risky move. i hope he&#039;s just a stupid n00b buyer/scammer, for your sake

				I already had the money.&nbsp; He finalized.&nbsp; Then he tried to blackmail me with my review.<br /><br />It does look fixed. Not sure what happened there.&nbsp; If he figured out I am not giving him squat and letting the world know what he really is doing.
