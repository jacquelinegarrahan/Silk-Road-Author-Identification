				let&#039;s say i get a lot of a certain type of mail.&nbsp; we&#039;ll use travel magazines and travel-related solicitations for the sake of this example.&nbsp; would it be ok to ask a seller to make the sender/return address sound like a travel agent company (if i know that they typically do return addys)?&nbsp; i just wonder if having all these weird and random types of businesses from all over the place might throw a flag.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then I think the mailmain handles so many freaking pieces of mail and doesn&#039;t know who is in each unit that it might not matter.<br /><br />What do you think?

				Several really good, really nice vendors&nbsp; state that they will make the return address what you need. Mr. DDro, a few others, and I say, bravo.

				yea idk - i go to PO with so many packages at once it&#039;s unwise to be mixing shit up like that.<br />way safer to be just one entity.<br />I did do that for a client once but i had to hold his package out and take it by itself to a whole different town to mail.<br /><br />U worry too much - No offense but thumbs down on that idea.<br /><br />&lt;3 ;<br />Christy

				Sounds like a good idea...not to hard to implement and gives a little bit of extra security.

				Ask the vendor if he is open to the idea of a per request return address. Asking someone if they are open to an idea is really a win/win because the vendor can say no and you dont get offended.

				given the level of automation at the USPS, I would be concerned that shipping an item from say california, with a return address of say Ohio, might increase the potential for hands on scrutiny.

				No true, it happens all the time in business travel - when you send AV equipment from a hotel your meeting at, and the return is going to be your home office addr. 40 more examples of why....

				I ask all vendors for tech or electronic return addresses and all have been happy to comply. Most vendors care about your security.

				I wonder if that old, &quot;return to sender, address unknown&quot; trick works... <br />where you cross out the &quot;address&quot; add the RTSAU phrase and put it in a mailbox.&nbsp; Will they actually send it back to the &quot;return&quot; address?<br />It could be a whole different way of shipping if it did work.&nbsp; Maybe.

				- suggesting a return address ...could be ok....just means the seller has to come up with an appropriate name and address.....some sellers have are used to a routine<br />&nbsp; of using &quot;certain&quot; details....<br /><br />
