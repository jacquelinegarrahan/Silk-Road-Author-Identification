				Hi peeps.<br /><br />What I&#039;m looking for (and I&#039;m sure others want it too) is the ability to view listings in £s or EUROs. A forum member has actually done this before, quiet successfully; see http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28589.0 .He even included a price per gram column as well!<br />&nbsp;<br />He used a add-on program called Greasemonkey (Java), and after some other forum members deemed it to be safe, I down loaded it from; https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/137270 . It was GREAT! I really got used to seeing my own currency (£) next to listings, and it made budgeting my money a lot easier. I know people have said before &quot;why don&#039;t you just work it out in your head?&quot;. Well, if that&#039;s true, then why do anything to make our lives simpler? Anyway, as soon as I&#039;d got used to it, the SR upgrade came along and the add-on no-longer worked.<br /><br />I have no programming skills myself :( And I&#039;ve given up waiting for this to be implemented officially (just see how many threads in the Feature Request forum there are asking for this!), I don&#039;t know why it wasn&#039;t implemented during this last upgrade. They don&#039;t need to have the option of pegging the listing prices to the extra currencies. So, do you have the skills for this challenge? Can it be done on the upgraded SR like it was done before? Could the old add-on just be modified to work again? Who else wants to see their own currency?<br /><br />All the best...

				There&#039;s no harm in doing what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />But the reason I won&#039;t be using it is that the amount in my own currency quickly looses its meaning once I have bitcoins in my account due to fluctuations. It&#039;s true that my 10 bitcoins might be worth X today, but what matters to me is what I paid for my bitcoins when I purchased them. And your hypothetical app won´t help me with that.

I&#039;m looking for an update.<br />Surely you&#039;ve got it backwards? What you paid for your bitcoins when you purchased them quickly looses it&#039;s meaning due to the bitcoin fluctuations. It&#039;s the value of the bitcoins in your account and what there worth today that matters when you make a purchase. It&#039;s no good saying &quot;but my bitcoins were worth $100 when I purchased them, I don&#039;t care that they&#039;re now worth just $80, I still want to buy your $100 item!&quot; ???<br /><br />Take a look at the app that we previously used. It had a button called &quot;update&quot; at the bottom of the page that was linked to Intersango and updated the exchange rate when pressed, in real time. With all those extras, like the price per gram, it really was a useful bit of code.

				So, here is your script: https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/140806 (Just right click Install and go to View User Script Source, you&#039;ll get the prompt to install it.)<br /><br />The same caveats about requests and local storage apply. It pulls 24-hour weighted averages from http://bitcoincharts.com/t/weighted_prices.json, and caches &#039;em for one hour. A dozen-some currencies are included (look in the bottom left), and you can easily use your own by simply typing in the value of 1BTC. (So if you type %30, ฿1 becomes %30.) It tries to calculate prices per gram, but with the way people write descriptions you shouldn&#039;t count on it always being right. And of course I may have made some error that means the whole thing is cocked up somehow-- I&#039;ve only tested in the latest TorBrowser on Mac, so let me know how it works out for you!<br /><br />HOWEVER: You should be aware that it is not possible for a lay person to tell by looking if JavaScript is malicious or not. It shouldn&#039;t be able to pierce the TOR veil (as long as you haven&#039;t messed with any settings), but a skilled enough coder could embed obfuscated code that would wait until you enter your PIN and quietly drain your account. <br /><br />Of course my script does not do this, but you probably should not take my word for it. I recommend using the script to browse, but disabling GreaseMonkey while logged in until someone you trust who knows JavaScript reads through it and verifies that there is no funny business.

				Looked through the script nothing jumped out at me as unsafe, I only spent about 5 minutes looking at it though. Didn&#039;t test it.

				Thanks for the vote of confidence :) Actually glad you didn&#039;t test it, because I just did and realized I had cleverly managed to break it with a stupid typo right before I uploaded it. Working now!<br /><br />I also took the opportunity to limit it to only the home, category and item pages, but keep in mind that doesn&#039;t necessarily make it safe.

				I&#039;ve got the other one mostly working. Will throw it up on userscripts.org shortly.<br /><br />(I think Qaz&#039;s is better, though. A single site-wide currency switcher makes more sense to me.)<br />

				Has anyone had a chance to try my script out? Says 56 installs... After spending the time to make it, I feel like I should post it somewhere else so people get some benefit from it, but I want to make sure it&#039;s working for people first.
