				Good dark Hash goes for 20-30 a gram where I&#039;m from if buying individual grams. (most drugs are very expensive where im from = ) some people charge 150 dollars for grams of molly. *nods head* jesus....<br />So I&#039;m going to try buying 2x100 gram listings of the good afghan &quot;Original Soft Kabul&quot; Hash from Djabbar, and make some real dough!!<br />does anybody have a quality report on this hash? it is 2 times more expensive than most other hash he has listed, but still only 6.5 dollars a gram which of course is cheap if im selling them for 25 a gram. <br />Cheers!<br /><br />-Seshat

				hey Djabbar has great Black hash BUT beware always use the tracking option so you know where your parcel is it always takes 20-27 days to Canada with tracking so be prepared to wait BUT the end result is worth it <br /><br />I sell 5-6LBs every 2 mths so the shipping from him is just to long for my business you can get great soft blonde from BOSS and takes 10 days from Italy and you get free tracking # so this would be the best deal

				Yeah I occasionally use MDMA but where I&#039;m at people shit bricks for pure MDMA since their standard is &quot;200mg&quot; or commonly referred to as &quot;.2&quot; and I tried at 1st to explain that you don&#039;t need 200mg of pure MDMA-HCl but they were stuck on that .2 standard so I just started saying yeah sure its .2 collecting the $20 for what really was 140mg +-10mg and I go back to my friends complaining about how everyone asks me if there is .2 in my caps

				Forget the 200 grams for 660 from djabbar...<br /><br />that Moroccan hash sucks... I have got many bad reviews because of it... so many I had to liquidate it in the streets...<br /><br /><br />Thats my two cents!<br /><br /><br />

				YA BOSS has some good Hash But I have a lot better and costs more But the Dam Buzz is great and burns clean great in a Pipe or Joint even Bots<br /><br />Djabbars 200g Plague is a waste of BTC for sure way to hard and crumbles not bad if a buyer wants 2g&#039;s already crumbled upon delivery shit saves breaking it down yourself
