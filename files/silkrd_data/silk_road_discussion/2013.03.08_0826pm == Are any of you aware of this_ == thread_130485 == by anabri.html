				I&#039;m sure we can all agree it&#039;s fake but god dammit. I read a post that said &quot;you&#039;re ruining a good thing for a lot of good people&quot; or something and that&#039;s so true. It&#039;s probably Adam Kokesh or someone who idolizes him. haha. I used to like him but lost a lot if not all respect for him after that youtube video. sorry, off topic. umm, I&#039;m aware of this now.

				Why does people do things like this? That&#039;s why I fucking hate social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter, just makes it more difficult for places like these to stay under the radar.

				They might as well walk into the nearest police station and announce that they use SR.<br /><br />That&#039;s the lowest of the low hanging fruit.<br /><br />BTW, I like how that group &quot;likes&quot; Firefox. They should make a group for Tor and like that too. :)

				Stupid asses. Same shit happened a few years ago to a dude running a pot store online in Amsterdam - got too popular and finally fell apart; however, on the other side, he (she?) was apparently moving orders sized in kilos, and I suspect that had something to do with it as well. It was a shame, he/she sold some really really good weed!
