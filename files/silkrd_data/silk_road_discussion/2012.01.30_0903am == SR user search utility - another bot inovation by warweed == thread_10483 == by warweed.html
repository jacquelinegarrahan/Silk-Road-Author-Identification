				warweed, you rock.<br />This will be really useful, thanks! Asset indeed.<br /><br />I could really use a bot that monitors my head stash quantity on hand, using order history&nbsp; to calculate lead times and ballpark cost, then finds the best deals using price comparison algorithms, obtains and deposits the correct amount of btc in my SR account, and finally places the orders....&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; ^) <br /><br />Alternatively, being able to search based on country of origin would be really useful as well.<br />(and yes, the useless &quot;undeclared&quot; origin designation is the sand in that vagina)<br /><br />

				cheers My scripting knowledge is limited but i&#039;m learning more and more this project is teaching me alot actually the project as of today is now a collaboration between renton and I and plan to add functions for pgp submission and verification sr user statistics in regards to member joins and such hopefully some rough sales figures and a way to search sellers feedback easily for less then 5 out of 5 ratings rather then doing it manually and display links to that item .. <br /><br />I mean all these things are way down in the future but are all thoughts we are having :) also improvements on sr&#039;s current search functions is a thought because lets face it sr&#039;s search function sucks balls .. thou that has challanges by itself

				Indeed i kinda made it more or less for me but then got annoyed because everyone in the silc chat would nto shut the fuck up about is it up or down so i posted it .. i just made it super simple and made the title UP or DOWN that way i could just leave the tab open and go about my work or w.e and i could see when it was up or down :) the biggest annoyance is not using java script&nbsp;

				Hey warweed if you have an idea to return the BTC exchange rate display it would be great. I think the reason SR remove that function was because if SR site gets the BTC rate update from MtGox/or where ever, SR IP address or server information would be compromised, since a connection would be needed. Is there anyway the script can be refreshed with a safe anonymous proxy?

				thanks secret squirrel are you who i think you are ?&nbsp; <br /><br />but yes this was identifyed prior to release it was more or less a quick utility toss together when i have time to work on it i will be implimenting a regex how ever server side the security is not a issue and the script runs thru transparent tor how ever i guess i should get of my ass and fix it up proper the problem with a regex is sr does not impliment one for user sign up so there are a bunch of special chars in usernames

I&#039;m not saying the site itself sucks -- because I think it&#039;s great -- but I&#039;m saying that releasing code that you know is vulnerable is a bad thing.

				Thanks to lilith2u for the .14 btc donation you are the first to donate and i really appreciate it <br /><br />to reply to supersecretsquirrel<br /><br />im sorry the code is closed source you may externally audit it if you choose but it does not contain and sql or anything of the like and is rather low tech and uses the kiss principle the xss was identified before release even due to it injecting the variable into the body of the page the regex stopped that&nbsp;

				Hey War this is just a small nitpicky design/usability tip but what you just said about only one person donating to you made me think to tell you - On the results page after you search, you should make your name a link to your page. More people would be inclined to donate to you if they didn&#039;t have to hunt you down : )

				I&#039;m high right now so maybe I&#039;m missing something.&nbsp; If I knew the vendors name why would I need to search for it using Warweeds bot?&nbsp; There needs to be a bot where you can search for drugs not vendors (yes, I&#039;m aware of the one on SR but that hides the stealth vendors so it&#039;s useless to find the drug you want from a stealth vendor).&nbsp; Again, I apologize if I&#039;m missing something on account of being fucked up.&nbsp;
