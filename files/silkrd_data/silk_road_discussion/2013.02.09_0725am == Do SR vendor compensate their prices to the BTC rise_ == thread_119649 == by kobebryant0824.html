				As everyone have noticed the BTC rates are insane, the current low is at $22.00 for 1 BTC<br /><br />What I have noticed is that the prices on SR has not seem to change much even with the rise, it still figures to be at the same US DOLLAR RATE..<br />ex. Vendor had 5x 30mg oxycodone with free shipping at around $135&nbsp; (when BTC rates were about $14)<br />ex. Vendor had 5x 30mg oxycodone with free shipping at around $135 (when BTC rates are now $22)<br /><br />Do these adjust automatically and rates usually doesn&#039;t matter much on the SR?<br /><br />is this true? Sorry if I didn&#039;t exactly word this right or make sense, but I hope you could understand enough to answer this

				Example and Crazybart are correct. The product price should remain the same price no matter what the BTC price jumps to if the vendor pegs their listings. There are a couple ho dont but its rare.
