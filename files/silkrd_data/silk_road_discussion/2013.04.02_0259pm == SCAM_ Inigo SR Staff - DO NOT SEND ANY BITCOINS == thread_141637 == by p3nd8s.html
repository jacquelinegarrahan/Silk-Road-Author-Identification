				I received an email today from an Inigo imposter under the name of &quot;SR Staff,&quot; do not send any money to that address people, it is a SCAM! In only 8 hours he has been able to scam 666BTC out of people, so some have already lost money. <br />The email is below:<br />----------------------------------<br />SR Staff &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning Silk Road vendors and buyers, my name is Inigo. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Silk Road.<br /><br />Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week, and that there has been some strange goings on since it being back online. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this, many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.<br /><br />I will tell you that domestic rate options are one (choose to view in EUR &amp; GBP as well as USD) and also a new exchange feature will be implemented next month. We have also added more admin accounts which will be better staffed to assist you.<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. This can all be verified with DPR&#039;s forum post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138016.0 Or message him here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/b1e30b5819 Please do not speak about this on the forums yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; Dread Pirate Roberts share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200&#039;000 per month or $2&#039;400&#039;000 annually Shares will be priced at $500 for a 0.1% share, paid in btc (see below) at Mt. Gox&#039;s weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.<br /><br />There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types.<br /><br />Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your SR account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.<br /><br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it.<br /><br />Payment address - 1F48CymZsof76oZob8UiCAaz7P4yUdnz7M<br /><br />If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.<br /><br />Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging SR Financial here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/733d1d49e8 with your Transaction ID, User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total btc sent.<br /><br />Example<br />Subject - SR Investments<br />#277349296<br />Inigo<br />4 x 0.1<br />à¸¿29.20<br /><br />This is strictly first come, first served. As, said before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.<br /><br />Thank you and good luck<br /><br /><br />Inigo<br />SR Staff

				I have a hard time believing anyone sent this scammer 290 BTC. At first I thought it was a mixing service address, but the first transaction was 10 hours ago. He may be sending his own coins to the address, to make it look like lots of people are investing large amounts.<br /><br />I hope nobody has actually sent him money.<br />

				Isn&#039;t it about time that advertising online status was disabled by default?<br /><br />It&#039;s always been a security threat, but these scams and spams seem to be on the rise recently. There have been like 5 in the last week, and the scammers get the user info from the list of online people on the main page. I know, because I have online status turned off and never get these messages.<br /><br />The only argument I&#039;ve heard against it is that some people like to know when their friends are on. That&#039;s fine, but these people are a tiny minority. Most people don&#039;t use this feature. Their online status is enabled because they don&#039;t know they can turn it off.<br /><br />Disable online status and let the people who want to use that feature explicitly turn it on and accept the risk.<br />

				They get the list of people from the online status and then send PMs to them.<br /><br />It&#039;s the most efficient way to do it, rather than going through the long member list, where 80% of accounts have never posted and 90% of them haven&#039;t logged in in a long time and probably won&#039;t log in again.<br /><br />I&#039;m online a lot (unfortunately :) ) and I never get these messages. Others that I have advised to turn off online status also don&#039;t get these messages anymore. I&#039;m 99% certain that&#039;s how at least some of the scammers do it.<br />

				Wait wait.. Wait a minute.<br /><br />I have THREE kind of these messages in my inbox, all 3 different usernames and deposit addresses:<br /><br />The first message is from &quot;SR Staff&quot;, the second message is from &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; and the third is form &quot;STAFFInigo&quot;<br /><br />Since i lost 2 btc last week with the SRAdmin scam, i didn&#039;t fall into the &quot;STAFFInigo&quot; message again. It&#039;s OBVIOUSLY a fake, because of the no spacebar in the name.<br /><br />But..... are you guys telling me that &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; and &quot;SR Staff&quot; are scams too? How the f*** can a scammer get access to an account with a SPACEBAR in the username. And wasn&#039;t &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; the offical vendor support account????<br /><br />..?? Can please anyone confirm that they are all scammers ? Or is &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; real ?<br /><br /><br /><br />---------- Gosh, seriosuly, isn&#039;t SR Vendor Support an official name??? How can a scam message be sent from that username????<br /><br />I am so lucky that i read the forums first, i was almost going to deposit 200BTC. I am so glad, i would have been so upset if this has happeend.<br /><br />I still don&#039;t get it how they can get hold on those usernames, i thought SR doesn&#039;t allow spacebars in usernames&nbsp; :-\ :-\ :-\ :-\<br /><br />

				Just received this in my vendor acct on SR as well.<br />Sounded fishy, would be a good deal but the cash in vs cash out ratio isn&#039;t logical for SR side. THey would be losing entirely too much on a small investment of 125k. Not to mention there was no way to buy in, just an address to send funds to.<br />Anyways, there should be a ban on names containing ADMIN, SR, SILKROAD, or anything else that could be used for fishing scams like these. I hope people didn&#039;t lose too much on this one and if they did, do more research next time.

				And yet still no message from an official account on SR warning users it is a scam.&nbsp; I think people that send these people money are idiots but there should still be some kind of action taken on the site by the staff (which seems nonexistent at this point, other than mods here).&nbsp; Ho hum.&nbsp; And no, not all vendors/users visit these forums, there are some of us that come every now and again just to sift through all the bullshit.<br /><br />I&#039;d really like to hear how the lack of any action whatsoever by the staff is helping the &quot;community&quot;.&nbsp; On the other hand...maybe it&#039;ll help get some of the morons out of here, but of course they will be replaced by new ones and the scam will work again...rinse and repeat.<br /><br />I do find it comical that a few new accounts have popped up spamming similar shit with similar names, the funniest being STAFFInigo..&nbsp; Scamapalooza baby, everybody on board....choooo choooo!

				As posted in the other thread regarding this, this person probably made close to 120, 000....<br /><br />For me I knew it seemed fishy, because I got three from different sellers, plus the math just didn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />0.1% for $500 = $500, 000. So SR makes 2.5 mil annually but they value themselves at 500, 000.<br /><br />That&#039;s what made it seem way to fishy for me.<br /><br />Also, I have NEVER ever EVER in my 4 years as a buyer and couple months of a vendor got an email from an SR admin that was not from the standard SR Support account.<br /><br />Also if the same person made all three accounts I estimate he actually made closer to $120, 000.....rat bastard -__- <br /><br /><br />Hoping SR is down atm to deal with the scamming situation. I just cringe knowing this thief made 130, 000 off this stupid scam, even if none of it was mine.

I was talking about the forum.<br /><br />Since at least one person mentioned that their online status is disabled and they got the messages, this must have been a more sophisticated attack. The scammer may have crawled all profiles and looked for people who had logged in in the last day, or 3 days. It makes no sense to target people who haven&#039;t been around for a while. Also, unless there&#039;s a bug in SR that exposed account names, he would have to get the names from the forum. I don&#039;t know, maybe 80% of users have the same name on both accounts, so it wasn&#039;t that hard once he found the recently active ones.<br /><br />It&#039;s all guesswork, anyway.<br />

And yea I agree with previous post I thought the 2.5 seemed short as well. <br /><br />And regarding SR pulling this scam, everything they MAKE&nbsp; is pure profit. The amount of transactions on here 100,000 is peanuts, plus the response wouldn&#039;t have been so fast. The warnings were out here by the morning, and the posts taken down as well. So I could easily confirm that this was a scam.<br /><br />Just wouldn&#039;t make sense for this to be SR imho.
