Iv herd if u put it in water and it desolvs smoothly then thats one way.. I have never done this but sounds like something id like to try simply cause i hear it helps depression which is my worst demon. I dont wanna get soo trippy the first time i just wanna get a slight feeling to know what is to come if more is done.. Can someone give me info and also tell me what the feeling is of being in a &quot;K-hole&quot; Is it scary? How long does it last?? Please help guys

				It will last roughly one hour.<br />First time when I did K, I underestimated the power of it and instead of going for small bumps I did a huge line probably 200mg, straight in the K-hole. At that time I was not aware of &quot;K-hole&quot;.<br />Needless to say, I was scared shitless and I didn&#039;t know what the fuck is happening.<br /><br />Do not underestimate K, it&#039;s a beautiful drug if taken correctly.<br />

				Was this purchased from a legit, vouched for vendor on SR? If so, stop being a pussy and just do a little bump. :P<br /><br />A little bump, like the little mound you could get on the tip of your finger, will only make you feel a little spacey and relaxed (which sounds like you could use tbh). I know that because that&#039;s all the ket I&#039;ve ever done, of course, but still, unless you have grave reason to mistrust the source, I would say you&#039;re worrying way too much (*cough* posting threads all over the forums *cough*). Just do a little bump and see if you like it. If you do, do a little more. If not, send the rest to me. I&#039;ll compare it with the gram I have on the way. ;)

If you bought it on the road then it is probably real. K is a strong drug, don´t start racking yourself up coke sized lines unless you want to K-Hole. The best way to do it is put a car key into the baggie. so the end has a little bump on it and straight up the nosewalking around should feel like you are on a bouncy castle, and it will be hard to concentrate on things around you. These effects get more pronounced the more you do. Till you get to the hole. A K hole can be very daunting the first time you go in, especially seeing as you are not expecting it. the best was I can describe it is this: reality melts or fragments away, so the room you were sitting in disappears and you enter another world, some people see its as a roller coaster, some as floating around, some as time loops, its different for everyone. Then slowly as it wears off you and your brain starts to gradually come back to the room you were in. until you are back and everything appears to make sense again... This gives me an idea for a new topic
