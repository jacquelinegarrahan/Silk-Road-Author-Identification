				SR is on FB too, so what? Reading and writing about illegal activities is not illegal. Buying, selling and possessing illegal products is. There is a big jump from the forums to the actual transactions. Just don&#039;t post your real name, address, SSN etc anywhere on any kind of forum, on any kind of network clear or hidden. I think the cops are reading this but if they could they would&#039;ve shut this down already. I would stay away from international shipping but people have been shipping drugs since the begging of shipping. There are also a ton of videos on YT and ton of info on the clear net all explaining SR in detail. At first I thought why are they all over FB and YT? But then I thought why should they be absent? It just comes to show how popular drug use actually is. It also shows how confident SR is in it&#039;s security. These are indeed interesting times... The cops are losing their stupid war on drugs.

				What typtap said. Those sites aren&#039;t anything to do with silk road, they just allow you to browse hidden services via the clearnet. Silk road can&#039;t &quot;shut them down&quot;. Don&#039;t use them.<br /><br />Also, people were confused because &quot;freenet&quot; is another anonymous network, similar to Tor. Using &quot;freenet&quot; to describe the clearnet is ambiguous.<br /><br />(I know, for anyone who intends to correct me, freenet isn&#039;t really very similar to Tor. That&#039;s just a quick way for me to explain)

				So, I&#039;ve thought about this deeply myself and couldn&#039;t understand why this other onion site i know which specializes in firearms is still up and has been up since 2010... It&#039;s the way these sites are configured.<br />But mostly, it&#039;s not like everyone in the world has heard of this site. In fact, all of my friends who are junkies and speed freaks haven&#039;t even heard of Silk Road so its fairly new.<br />Also, you gotta learn a little more about government and corruption, I read somewhere in a news article that they couldn&#039;t even get a name or contact information on the web host of SR. The government makes money when websites like this and the old thepiponline2.com are up. Some of them are even tied in with these sites, maybe.<br />But the more drugs sold safetly with no violence, but still stand posession charges brings in more cashflow to criminal justice and the prison system if you can understand that. Don&#039;t get me wrong this websites probably HATED amongst most DEA agents but since they can&#039;t take it down, they have to learn to love it&nbsp; :D<br />If it weren&#039;t from Silk Road, that kid on the East Coast of US with the pound of pure &quot;ICE&quot; Methamphetamine wouldn&#039;t of got caught in a parking lot naked after a 5 day binge with 2grams shoved up his ass which he had police confiscate.&nbsp; :-\

				I am so confused.&nbsp; Are you all saying that onion sites can be accessed AND used with just a regular internet connection?&nbsp; <br /><br />I know peeps can get to and view the SR site without Tor because I first checked out SR from a public computer.&nbsp; Are you saying peeps can also create accounts and buy drugs without using Tor too???&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, I am clueless &amp; I admit it - many of you already know how impaired I am when it comes to technology ... thank you&nbsp; :o

I have even seen you helping others with PGP so you must have a good head and heart.<br /><br /><br />When you visit a onion.to address your data leaves your computer unencrypted and travels via the clearnet to whomever is hosting this service. On its way through their service your information is encrypted by Tor and sent to the SR. The service sees all your data unencrypted: password, login, what you are browsing, etc. They see your computer&#039;s IP address. Since your data is leaving your computer unencrypted your ISP can also see all that you are doing. <br /><br />It is about the *worst* situation possible. No anonymity. No privacy.

				I get a kick out of it when people without a clue tell me the government could shut down sr anytime it wants to but is waiting to complete the investigation. Then they tell me its not hard to crack tor or pgp. You can&#039;t reason with these people but as the years go on and sr keeps going it may sink in.<br /><br />They will probably do a big bust of people foolish enough to buy using .to links and try to make it sound like they are closing down sr. That would not surprise me at all
