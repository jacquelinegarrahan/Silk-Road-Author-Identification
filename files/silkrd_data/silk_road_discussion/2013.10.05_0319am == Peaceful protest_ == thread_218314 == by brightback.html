				I would understand why vendors and bigger buyers wouldn&#039;t want to, but I&#039;m just a personal user that liked having SR when I needed it, Couldn&#039;t we set up some kind of peaceful protests before one of the so called DPR&#039;s court dates. We aren&#039;t going to stop the government, just thought it might raise his spirits or something if he knew people were there in his support.

				Sounds like a HUGE waste of time.&nbsp; Protests rarely work these days unless there are THOUSANDS of protesters participating. Gathering such a massive number of participants and organizers is extremely UNLIKELY, especially for a cause that&#039;s considered stupid for the majority of Americans. <br /><br />A peaceful rally in support of an online black market for drugs/weapons/illegal services/hacking will NEVER appeal to the masses and will fail miserably.&nbsp; Also, a protest to &quot;raise the spirit&quot; of DPR sounds like a unworthy cause and really accomplishes NOTHING for the protestors. People already know DPR has a huge support base, he&#039;s a multimillionaire through his SR operations, so I doubt we can or need to do much to &quot;raise his spirits.&quot; If you care so much, maybe try to write him letters or donate $ to him.<br /><br />Finally, I am CERTAIN that NO PERSON would prefer showing themselves in public rallying for the biggest anonymous internet black market and it&#039;s founder. If anything, people are more concerned about getting off the radar &amp; attention of the LEOs after SR&#039;s seizure.<br />

Why not? Protesting drug policy doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re a drug user or seller. There are plenty of people (in my family alone) who don&#039;t use drugs but at the same time don&#039;t agree with US drug policy or with criminalizing/institutionalizing drug users. As long as it&#039;s peaceful and you don&#039;t get arrested, you can protest semi-anonymously (I say semi because they could ID you with facial recognition software, but why on earth would they bother?). Besides, they are not going to start surveil&nbsp; people who show up to support DPR or who protest his treatment.<br /><br />You can protest anything you like. The point isn&#039;t to &quot;stop them,&quot; the point is to raise awareness for drug policy change and to focus attention on how wasteful and pointless the war on drugs is. The point is to gain popular support.

The number of non-violent drug offenders in prison has drawn a ton of media attention in the last 10 years. I wouldn&#039;t say that the &quot;majority&quot; of Americans find this to be&nbsp; stupid cause. People are less willing to support DPR because of the alleged murder-for-hire incidents.

As a general opportunity to protest laws that pointlessly waste Government and LE resources while doing far more harm to people than good, this could be a very effective idea. While Mr Ulbricht may know the truth, the general public probably think of SR users as worthless street junkies with computers, if they bother to think of us as humans at all rather than as site and financial statistics. A large crowd of actual real people, of all ages, genders and states of attire, showing that they really believe it&#039;s time to make a stand for civil liberties, might actually make some dent in public perceptions.<br /><br />One thing I would advise is to prepare a small group of erudite people, preferably with a little media experience, to head in the direction of the press when they appear to explain the principles of the protest. One thing the media love is to grab an extensive interview with a raving anarchist loony as representative of an entire movement.
