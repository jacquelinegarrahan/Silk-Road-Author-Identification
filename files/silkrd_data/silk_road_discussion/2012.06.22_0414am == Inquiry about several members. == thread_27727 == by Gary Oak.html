In case you&#039;re wondering what my motive is behind this, I&#039;m obviously LEO and this is for my report. Mr. Dank will tell you all about it. ::) No but seriously, I&#039;m curious!! :-X

				SR geeks is a member group that can be applied for in the profile tab. I don&#039;t know the requirements for joining. As to the boards you can&#039;t view, I don&#039;t know, they must have blocked them from you personally, because I have 20 here...not really, but there is the vendor section that is hidden to non vendors, I would imagine there is an admin&#039;s lounge that only DPR, DA, and ut4ha have access to. there may also be a moderators lounge for all the Mods, then maybe they still count the welcom to smf board that is on a fresh install, but that still leaves a couple un-accounted for.

I&#039;m also aware of the Vendors lounge, but obviously I&#039;m not a vendor unless you count spreading HIV throughout the forums. :-\ I think you&#039;re right about the moderators and admins having a place to discuss current topics outside of personal messaging, but the current staff seems small enough that it doesn&#039;t seem necessary. After all, there&#039;s only Limetless, chronicpain, nomad bloodbath, squidShepherd, DigitalAlch, and Dread Pirate Roberts that I know of. ???

				Lol I am sure Tony has never stepped away and made a vendor account way before he went AWOL. I bet people who got scammed by him have bought from him unknowingly numerous times afterwards.

				chances are he is here. there is some discussion that has spilled onto SR about OPI being tony. I am not 110% convinced, but I have a higher than average feeling that there will be a lot of hurt feelings shortly when OPI pulls the rug from under his customers.

				Well what makes the connection between OPI and Tony seem plausible is that Tony specifically made it a point to discredit OPI and say he was a scammer, and even mentioned in PM&#039;s to someone that he thought OPI was going to do a 4/20 scam. It seems like that could of been smoke and mirrors to make people think they aren&#039;t related/same person.

				I think every single one of them is either the actual, or associate of, Mr Dank.<br /><br />I mean it would make sense. Mister Dank has 10 letters in his name. 10 x 5.4 = 54. That guy has 54 posts. Coiincidence?<br /><br />This is just further proof that Mister Dank is actually not himself, but a parody of himself, talking about a parody of himself, thinking about a parody of himself, whilst actually being himself. <br /><br />FACT
