				Weedmanuk SR intro&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/76e39b92f0<br /><br />Hi I have been registered as a vendor on SR for 18 days and have listings up for a while now.(i also have quite a fans) but sadly to date I have not had any luck in attracting purchasers, I understand it is not going to happen straight away and completely understand why ! However someone suggested to me that I provide samples of my product to prove myself, at first I didnt feel I needed to do that as I know all is good from me, but as things still aint moving I,m willing to give it a try I am thinking of doing say 50x .5g for free as a sign of me being a pucker vendor. I wont be doing this for a good few days yet but I need a little advise on how I would do this on SR without involving costs for the purchaser eg SR&#039;s fees !! I need to do it through SR to enable me to receive feedback from my free samples I would also stipulate that buyers must have 5x good feedback stats as a buyer and your are only entitled to 1 freebie per customer.<br /><br />Can anyone advise how I set this up on SR to get things moving. Many Thanks.......<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/76e39b92f0<br /><br />Replies to weedmanuk@tormail.org or here greatly appreciated...

				Hello Weedmanuk,<br /><br />Sounds like a very good idea to get started, perhaps the only way - God knows we need another decent UK weed vendor, one of the biggest having gone downhill recently!<br /><br />From my experience vendors seem to simply price the sample at 0bc, I assume then that there would be no applicable comms due to SR?<br /><br />Anyhow - hopefully others will pipe in to confirm shortly. Good luck and count me in for one!<br /><br />gloomy.

				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/76e39b92f0<br /><br />Ok thanks GB I havent actually tried to list yet as I am waiting for a decent supply (amount) to be ready hopefully just a few more days !&nbsp; and hopefully it will be as easy as you say ! I am obviously waiting so that when my samples get out there I have a decent amount to back it up ...

				Good idea mate - you want to launch in style and follow through so definitely best to wait until you are completely ready.<br /><br />Have you been to the UK cannabis buyer&#039;s thread? http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11298.msg878902#msg878902<br /><br />When you are ready to go it will be best to advertise there I think, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get lots of interest once the samples are ready!<br /><br />Hope preparations go well.<br /><br />gloomy.
