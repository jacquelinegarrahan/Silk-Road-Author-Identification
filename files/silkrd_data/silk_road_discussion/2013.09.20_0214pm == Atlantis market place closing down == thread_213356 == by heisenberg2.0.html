				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />Hi All, <br /><br />Figured I would put the gossip monkeys out of business and make the announcement on here as well. <br />It was a fun run while it lasted and being press officer/spokesperson for an online black marketplace is certainly going to be one of the jobs I look back on with most fondest memory&#039;s. <br /><br />While I&#039;m sure lots of you will only be too happy about this I hope we can all agree Atlantis shook up the market and pushed SR to implement a lot of changes.<br /><br />PS. DPR, You can stop with the improvements now.Your competition is calling it a day for now :(<br /><br />Below is the official announcement from the Atlantis forum <br />http://atlmlxbk2mbupwgr.onion/index.php?topic=3726.0<br /><br /><br />Dear all users,<br /><br />We have some terrible news. Regrettably it has come time for Atlantis to close its doors. Due to security reasons outside of our control we have no choice but to cease operation of the Atlantis marketplace. Believe us when we say we wouldn&#039;t be doing this if it weren&#039;t 100% necessary.<br /><br />Due to the urgency we are allowing all users to withdrawal all their coins for one week before the site, and forum, are shut down permanently. Please remove all of your coins, these will not be recoverable after one week from now. Anything remaining in your accounts will be donated to a drug related charity of our choosing.<br /><br />We wish to thank all of you for making Atlantis a great and memorable place to trade on.&nbsp; We wish you all the best in your future endeavours. <br /><br />Best wishes,<br />The Atlantis team<br /><br /><br /><br />I will update with more info and maybe answer a few questions as I learn more or maybe I just get stereotypically drunk now and beg DPR for a job. <br /><br /><br />There will be lots of conspiracy theory&#039;s springing up here and no doubt the honeypot ones will continue but I can only say as the first and only &quot;employee&quot; of Atlantis I never believed any of it to be true based on my communications and general vibe of those I dealt with.<br />At the very least I was contacted by people &quot;pertaining&quot; to be LE so unless LE were looking to flip someone working for LE I don&#039;t know any more. <br /><br />Oh and thanks to you guys for teaching me how to handle the heat, You never made it too easy and I was always up for a challenge <br /><br />May Silk Road survive and prosper&nbsp; <br /><br />H2.0&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJSPFeAAAoJEDr/W2CU8yi6PeIP+wV3askQO1yOkH49ML9hb3S6<br />5WKFensIMSmc/WqaQlq6/LsjcdxqI1qNIJkmrCGmLj9if5WWf55ld+kP3fmqfVkU<br />yqJmaA2BdZHY3TJuLa4zFQH0h96LzyCA9mdN5WfQes3r+cB/adaI+7d/wOE4SVY3<br />806U5s6DC8XRDI8nMBMqWasMM3m0MTKomF9IECM4zIr4V474t5GszHDVjSfPiTuB<br />wp2e9Rde5QjqZIKYD99mwevRaCK9hWMfkePmOEUDji2roO45gGpYk4XphBfSTwDG<br />rBN/D6nlWfj/8nngXB5acVr8oM9KTS6dWQ3n/GhaqwNXjseag04SU5QFHy66KD//<br />wmINTdqT9hdZxfjwp2NWCmTjXZZyYNr0Dy43sSEeM5lH54GkeRaMfnDtinR8AiNI<br />LLYHNCSUsGQNheGNss7HxUHm409BLrSd0HJeS7cIij8jHf81+FsXlMoWsSQDwKCe<br />QXQj9l8TNtCE8xJudC23ITYHlckbFAvZocEMqD0XuKCIvH9TpSM5+CZe2wiyRRp1<br />buMd5LEeZsz/OSlqmCTcxvZc7lB8Vne9ecvdB8q+Cyf0CDLNF9Yzt8/2kl/4op26<br />fOjLr1Sfiia+v/zzuvkX2++er/tvJ7Egv8piPZaR71LENAWnntEEgT/x5tRvfnt3<br />Rs5jzdqFpzGTOKZFFIFF<br />=3D7k<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

				They burned their wick at both ends unfortunately, attempting to tap into a black market with explosive speed and marketing razzle-dazzle... a good move in the real world if done right, but probably a less wise option for operating an underground drug marketplace.<br /><br />These things need time, patience and slow, steady growth. Otherwise, security will (as has been proven) become an issue<br /><br />RIP, I guess

I&#039;d also like more details of the security risk. Are customers or their security at risk or have been compromised in any way?<br /><br />I never joined up on Atlantis, purely because I like Silk Road, worship DPR and his political motives and most of all because I know the dealers on the market that I can trust not to grass me up, sell my details or post me rat poison. <br /><br />Plus, I hated all the pishing links relating to that site and didn&#039;t like the fact that the DDoS attacks started when Atlantis did, which seemed fishy (at best). It&#039;ll be interesting to see if attacks like that don&#039;t happen to SR now that Atlantis has closed its doors. <br /><br />Anyway, details please?

				Your pride and greed destroyed you. A meritous individual does not call to the people for attention; they attend to him because they know he is meritous. A young man&#039;s pride is a story as old as time, but we absolutely cannot forget our place in this world; we are much lesser than those who seek to destroy us, and therefore we must hide. Times have changed. The reality is that in real life, we would be absolutely annhialated by the forces we passively fight. I think it is important that we do not forget this, and DPR has warned us against this type of behavior. Do not forget your place. And shun pride at every opportunity, for it is an evil force, promising glory, that only seeks to destroy you.

				Atlantis engaged in a wide variety of insecure practices, just from the publicly available information. Who knows what their server infrastructure and cash out methods were like. Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if one or more of the admins was identified or they have info that they are going to be raided or compromised.<br /><br />That&#039;s all speculation, of course. Maybe the admins finally read all the papers that came out this year showing how insecure Tor hidden services are and decided to quit while they were ahead.<br />

				^^^^ And why is that? How would belonging to another site with completely different passwords be compromising just because you use the same name? The only compromising thing would be your incoming and outgoing BTC wallet but I don&#039;t know any vendor who doesn&#039;t treat their wallets with direct connections to these sites as dirty which is why we clean the btc from that point on.

Believe us when we say we wouldn&#039;t be doing this if it weren&#039;t 100% necessary.<br /><br />Due to the urgency we are allowing all users to withdrawal all their coins for one week before the site, and forum, are shut down permanently. Please remove all of your coins, these will not be recoverable after one week from now. Anything remaining in your accounts will be donated to a drug related charity of our choosing.<br /><br />We wish to thank all of you for making Atlantis a great and memorable place to trade on.&nbsp; We wish you all the best in your future endeavours. <br /><br />Best wishes,<br />The Atlantis team<br /><br /><br /><br />I will update with more info and maybe answer a few questions as I learn more or maybe I just get stereotypically drunk now and beg DPR for a job. <br /><br /><br />There will be lots of conspiracy theory&#039;s springing up here and no doubt the honeypot ones will continue but I can only say as the first and only &quot;employee&quot; of Atlantis I never believed any of it to be true based on my communications and general vibe of those I dealt with.<br />At the very least I was contacted by people &quot;pertaining&quot; to be LE so unless LE were looking to flip someone working for LE I don&#039;t know any more. <br /><br />Oh and thanks to you guys for teaching me how to handle the heat, You never made it too easy and I was always up for a challenge <br /><br />May Silk Road survive and prosper&nbsp; <br /><br />H2.0&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJSPFeAAAoJEDr/W2CU8yi6PeIP+wV3askQO1yOkH49ML9hb3S6<br />5WKFensIMSmc/WqaQlq6/LsjcdxqI1qNIJkmrCGmLj9if5WWf55ld+kP3fmqfVkU<br />yqJmaA2BdZHY3TJuLa4zFQH0h96LzyCA9mdN5WfQes3r+cB/adaI+7d/wOE4SVY3<br />806U5s6DC8XRDI8nMBMqWasMM3m0MTKomF9IECM4zIr4V474t5GszHDVjSfPiTuB<br />wp2e9Rde5QjqZIKYD99mwevRaCK9hWMfkePmOEUDji2roO45gGpYk4XphBfSTwDG<br />rBN/D6nlWfj/8nngXB5acVr8oM9KTS6dWQ3n/GhaqwNXjseag04SU5QFHy66KD//<br />wmINTdqT9hdZxfjwp2NWCmTjXZZyYNr0Dy43sSEeM5lH54GkeRaMfnDtinR8AiNI<br />LLYHNCSUsGQNheGNss7HxUHm409BLrSd0HJeS7cIij8jHf81+FsXlMoWsSQDwKCe<br />QXQj9l8TNtCE8xJudC23ITYHlckbFAvZocEMqD0XuKCIvH9TpSM5+CZe2wiyRRp1<br />buMd5LEeZsz/OSlqmCTcxvZc7lB8Vne9ecvdB8q+Cyf0CDLNF9Yzt8/2kl/4op26<br />fOjLr1Sfiia+v/zzuvkX2++er/tvJ7Egv8piPZaR71LENAWnntEEgT/x5tRvfnt3<br />Rs5jzdqFpzGTOKZFFIFF<br />=3D7k<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The first post I read of yours on SR was about how you convinced SR admins to use the SMF filter to block the spam Atalantis URL&#039;s being posted, though someone else had posted that hours earlier and you used that for your own benefit. You lost all respect from me for that. No loss, Atlantis had no customers and mostly teenage sellers, shame, but you reap what you sow.<br /><br />World keep on turning.

Long before Atlantis and now apparently long after too. If anything this just says they can break Atlantis but not SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve always assumed that LE has had SR&#039;s number but are just trying to build as many cases against as many vendors as they can before pulling the trigger but now I&#039;m not too sure. I mean they took a while to take down ShadowCrew, CardersMarket, DarkMarket, and all of those carding sites of the old days and they were not Tor onion based sites but just regular old sites on regular old servers (one was based from San Fransisco!). And almost every one was taking down by use of a rat not by any high tech means.

				They didn&#039;t last long at all. Guess they should have spent more time learning from&nbsp; the forums here.<br /><br />My guess is they grew to fast and were caught unprepared by the trials and tribulations of operating on the dark web.<br /><br />Sr and the Sr forums are about so much more than trading on the dark web. SR has a core philosophy with a strong eclectic community supporting it which Atlantis did not have..<br /><br />I was not here at the beginning but as I understand it started from a small dedicated group that just kept growing. As new people signed up they felt like they were joining a community not just registering for a web site. <br /><br />No matter if you are hiding from authorities, don&#039;t want to be profiled, are speaking on politics, or just want your privacy then these forums will teach you how to be as anonymous as possible in todays world.&nbsp; <br />

Like directing their users to access the site through onion.to, which thankfully never did anything malicious but could have been an MITM proxy that stole people&#039;s account credentials like those Atlantis phishing sites. Or suggesting CryptoCat as a place to chat with reporters, when CryptoCat&#039;s encryption was broken up until a couple of months ago (why not use an in-house messaging system that you can control and secure rather than a third party service with a long history of security vulnerabilities?). Or the lack of a tumbler (how were coins transferred safely from buyers to sellers?). Or their media blitz, which brought way more unwanted attention on them than they needed, especially considering their size.<br /><br />The real reason for the shut down may be far more mundane than these speculations about security problems, though. Quite simply, they weren&#039;t profitable so they closed their business. They may have planned it all along. If the media blitz didn&#039;t bring in enough customers, they were going to quit. It was a hail mary and it didn&#039;t work. They got a decent number of sign ups, or so they claimed, but that didn&#039;t convert to sales, as is demonstrated by the fact that most listings have no reviews.<br /><br />The reason the media blitz didn&#039;t work and they lost in the competition against SR is not because of any security issues, since most people don&#039;t know anything about those issues and that was not a part of their decision making process. They lost because they couldn&#039;t beat the network effect on SR. <br /><br />How likely is Facebook to be replaced by another social network at this point? Any new social network will be a wasteland. If you sign up, you will have no friends there. But if you sign up on Facebook, half the people you know will already by on it, creating a better experience. SR&#039;s biggest asset is the people who are already using it. A new buyer can get instant access to 1200+ vendors, while a new vendor can get instant access to tens of thousands of buyers.<br /><br />Another aspect of it is the psychology of brand loyalty. SR has proven to be a trusted platform. People like and trust DPR (they don&#039;t merely put up him like Mark Zuckerberg, for example). People are rightfully suspicious of others in the drug world, because there are a lot of scammers and assholes, but SR works for the vast majority of people. It has proven itself. People stick with what works, rather than take risks with new products (or markets) even if they are theoretically a better alternative.<br />

That sketched the hell out of a lot of people regardless of the fact that it could be turned on/off. Had they never done that, they would have probably been serious competition to SR. The one feature made them seem like a LEO honeypot. That&#039;s a stigma they couldn&#039;t overcome no matter how they explain it away. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know if that was their fatal error, but it was one of many bone-headed mistakes. Like directing their users to access the site through onion.to, which thankfully never did anything malicious but could have been an MITM proxy that stole people&#039;s account credentials like those Atlantis phishing sites. Or suggesting CryptoCat as a place to chat with reporters, when CryptoCat&#039;s encryption was broken up until a couple of months ago (why not use an in-house messaging system that you can control and secure rather than a third party service with a long history of security vulnerabilities?). Or the lack of a tumbler (how were coins transferred safely from buyers to sellers?). Or their media blitz, which brought way more unwanted attention on them than they needed, especially considering their size.<br /><br />The real reason for the shut down may be far more mundane than these speculations about security problems, though. Quite simply, they weren&#039;t profitable so they closed their business. They may have planned it all along. If the media blitz didn&#039;t bring in enough customers, they were going to quit. It was a hail mary and it didn&#039;t work. They got a decent number of sign ups, or so they claimed, but that didn&#039;t convert to sales, as is demonstrated by the fact that most listings have no reviews.<br /><br />The reason the media blitz didn&#039;t work and they lost in the competition against SR is not because of any security issues, since most people don&#039;t know anything about those issues and that was not a part of their decision making process. They lost because they couldn&#039;t beat the network effect on SR. <br /><br />How likely is Facebook to be replaced by another social network at this point? Any new social network will be a wasteland. If you sign up, you will have no friends there. But if you sign up on Facebook, half the people you know will already by on it, creating a better experience. SR&#039;s biggest asset is the people who are already using it. A new buyer can get instant access to 1200+ vendors, while a new vendor can get instant access to tens of thousands of buyers.<br /><br />Another aspect of it is the psychology of brand loyalty. SR has proven to be a trusted platform. People like and trust DPR (they don&#039;t merely put up him like Mark Zuckerberg, for example). People are rightfully suspicious of others in the drug world, because there are a lot of scammers and assholes, but SR works for the vast majority of people. It has proven itself. People stick with what works, rather than take risks with new products (or markets) even if they are theoretically a better alternative.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is spot on the money. <br /><br />+Karma. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Atlantis? More like Costa Concordia, headed up by the same captain. That&#039;s what showboating gets you. (Running out of puns).<br /><br />Bank robberies don&#039;t happen that much anymore due to the fact that banks are much harder targets than they used to be (and they also don&#039;t carry as much cash anymore). One of the last successful bank robberies in my town happened a few years ago. It was an inside job - the perps knew that on the day of the robbery the bank would be carrying a six figure sum. The robbery started, the tellers activated the security screens, the robbers grabbed a customer and another staff member and threatened to shoot them if they didn&#039;t lower the screens. Of course the staff lowered the screens. The perps knew how long the safe time delays were and accounted for this. They knew police response time. Critically, they were completely covered in a one-piece black outfit. No skin whatsoever was showing. They all wore the same size shoes despite the fact that they were of different heights and likely had different shoe sizes, their shoe soles were filed down, the shoes were covered by the one-piece outfit anyway. They wore dark-tint strips of plastic taped over the eye holes of their one-piece outfits.<br /><br />They got away with a quarter of a million and have never been caught. Why? Because they left LE absolutely nothing to go on. No revealing features, no distinctive hairline, no strategically-applied bandaid riding up during the action to reveal a partial tattoo, no shiny new K-mart store-brand trainers that one of the traumatised tellers noticed because they were the same kind she bought her son, no cheap sunglasses. These are the kinds of leads that result in arrests, and even professional crims inadvertently or accidentally provide them. The robbers I&#039;m talking about didn&#039;t even speak. They were, in effect, ghosts. Four human-shaped black sacks of average height and build, nothing more could be said of them. No hair colours, complexions, accents, eye colours. They were in and out within four minutes carrying the cash in sturdy green reusable shopping bags that are available everywhere and millions of people use; the police arrived a minute later. The investigators had no suspects and few leads - a couple of stolen burnt out getaway cars which yielded nothing. Witnesses couldn&#039;t tell them anything they could go on. CCTV provided nothing of use. The mole wasn&#039;t caught, either. The bank closed that branch soon after. <br /><br />SR, I think, runs like that bank job. It stays below the radar, thoroughly quarantining site operations from the trading floor. The SR admins are completely anonymous, like the bank robbers above. A cop could login to the site as a buyer, a cop could become a vendor. A cop vendor may even be able to bust those who buy from them, but that&#039;s about as good as it&#039;s going to get, and then that vendor&#039;s through. A lot of work would have gone into building that vendor. Nice work, officer; for hundreds of man hours and a bunch of cash you&#039;ve caught a few recreational users who will most likely be cautioned or face community service (and if they don&#039;t say anything and have a good lawyer, they&#039;ll almost certainly walk). Undercover cop vendors can&#039;t get to other vendors, and they can&#039;t use the trading platform to harpoon the whale - they can&#039;t penetrate upstairs.<br /><br />SR has a guerrilla approach, it would seem. This is the darkweb, and SR uses it well. DPR, or the people who created and manage the persona of DPR, surface briefly when necessary, then sink back into the oblivion. No flashy marketing bullshit outside the site. The less that&#039;s said and done, the less LE have to go on. No leads and the case is dead. It seems like this is the way SR runs. I hope appearances aren&#039;t misleading.<br /><br />Of course there are peripheral weaknesses that could make the SR model untenable - disrupting the BTC supply, for example - but this will mean SR withers and dies. A shame, for sure. But its owners will walk away with jingling pockets instead of clinking shackles. If SR has to go down, that&#039;s how it should go down. But I reckon there&#039;s a pretty good chance SR will outlast the next Atlantis that rises and falls, and those after that.

				If it were LE related, the whole site would be shut down and abandoned they wouldn&#039;t still be handing out refunds and allowing logins. That seems questionable. <br /><br />Most likely it wasn&#039;t profitable so they shut down. <br /><br />Having LE contact you while running a darksite is pretty common. Carding forums have secret service guys trying to flip them constantly with bribes. Nobody knows if they are actually SS or just informants or just competitors trying to con them into shutting down. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think auto PGP encrypting messages to the vendors public key is &quot;shady&quot;, sure it&#039;s bullshit if you trust that but if anybody has sold anything here you know at least 70% of your customers aren&#039;t using encryption at all. You have to trust DPR to wipe the logs and that the server isn&#039;t already broken into and being watched, which is very likely considering they used to sell weapons here. That just might be worth disposing of a Nginx 0day. <br /><br />What was shady was their advertising campaign. They were begging for federal agent attention.

More like Costa Concordia, headed up by the same captain. That&#039;s what showboating gets you. (Running out of puns).<br /><br />Bank robberies don&#039;t happen that much anymore due to the fact that banks are much harder targets than they used to be (and they also don&#039;t carry as much cash anymore). One of the last successful bank robberies in my town happened a few years ago. It was an inside job - the perps knew that on the day of the robbery the bank would be carrying a six figure sum. The robbery started, the tellers activated the security screens, the robbers grabbed a customer and another staff member and threatened to shoot them if they didn&#039;t lower the screens. Of course the staff lowered the screens. The perps knew how long the safe time delays were and accounted for this. They knew police response time. Critically, they were completely covered in a one-piece black outfit. No skin whatsoever was showing. They all wore the same size shoes despite the fact that they were of different heights and likely had different shoe sizes, their shoe soles were filed down, the shoes were covered by the one-piece outfit anyway. They wore dark-tint strips of plastic taped over the eye holes of their one-piece outfits.<br /><br />They got away with a quarter of a million and have never been caught. Why? Because they left LE absolutely nothing to go on. No revealing features, no distinctive hairline, no strategically-applied bandaid riding up during the action to reveal a partial tattoo, no shiny new K-mart store-brand trainers that one of the traumatised tellers noticed because they were the same kind she bought her son, no cheap sunglasses. These are the kinds of leads that result in arrests, and even professional crims inadvertently or accidentally provide them. The robbers I&#039;m talking about didn&#039;t even speak. They were, in effect, ghosts. Four human-shaped black sacks of average height and build, nothing more could be said of them. No hair colours, complexions, accents, eye colours. They were in and out within four minutes carrying the cash in sturdy green reusable shopping bags that are available everywhere and millions of people use; the police arrived a minute later. The investigators had no suspects and few leads - a couple of stolen burnt out getaway cars which yielded nothing. Witnesses couldn&#039;t tell them anything they could go on. CCTV provided nothing of use. The mole wasn&#039;t caught, either. The bank closed that branch soon after. <br /><br />SR, I think, runs like that bank job. It stays below the radar, thoroughly quarantining site operations from the trading floor. The SR admins are completely anonymous, like the bank robbers above. A cop could login to the site as a buyer, a cop could become a vendor. A cop vendor may even be able to bust those who buy from them, but that&#039;s about as good as it&#039;s going to get, and then that vendor&#039;s through. A lot of work would have gone into building that vendor. Nice work, officer; for hundreds of man hours and a bunch of cash you&#039;ve caught a few recreational users who will most likely be cautioned or face community service (and if they don&#039;t say anything and have a good lawyer, they&#039;ll almost certainly walk). Undercover cop vendors can&#039;t get to other vendors, and they can&#039;t use the trading platform to harpoon the whale - they can&#039;t penetrate upstairs.<br /><br />SR has a guerrilla approach, it would seem. This is the darkweb, and SR uses it well. DPR, or the people who created and manage the persona of DPR, surface briefly when necessary, then sink back into the oblivion. No flashy marketing bullshit outside the site. The less that&#039;s said and done, the less LE have to go on. No leads and the case is dead. It seems like this is the way SR runs. I hope appearances aren&#039;t misleading.<br /><br />Of course there are peripheral weaknesses that could make the SR model untenable - disrupting the BTC supply, for example - but this will mean SR withers and dies. A shame, for sure. But its owners will walk away with jingling pockets instead of clinking shackles. If SR has to go down, that&#039;s how it should go down. But I reckon there&#039;s a pretty good chance SR will outlast the next Atlantis that rises and falls, and those after that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I agree, I said in a recent post that SR creates an air gap or firebreak between supplier and buyer at whatever level, so that LE infiltrator will only be able to bust the level below them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also it&#039;s difficult to see how bitcoin can be disrupted. Short of buying them all up. Any attempt to control them would surely just make them more valuable, and exchanges would move to hidden services, or people would trade them peer to peer, and they could still be used as short term currency.<br />Even buying them all up would just lead to the release of Bitcoin 2.0, which all black market users would then adopt .

				Not sure if this has already been posted (if it has, I&#039;ll just remove), but it seems like in an interview with our very own Australian journo Eiley (from All Things Vice).. &quot;Cicero&quot; (mod of Atlantis) has confirmed that the admins have decided to &#039;take the money and run&#039;. <br />*clearnet warning* http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4773902/shuttered-underground-drug-market-atlantis-ran-off-with-customers-money<br /><br />I, amongst many others, predicted a similar scenario months ago when Atlantis popped up.

They attracted the sellers but the buyers stayed away.<br /><br />My personal opinion is I don&#039;t think it was a long con, just a failed business venture. <br /><br />x Eiley

				Ah, good point there. I think accusing them of having planned a long con from the beginning is probably unfair (or atleast inaccurate). BUT, the fact that they apparently did hit the road with whatever funds were left in the accounts despite saying they were going to allow users to widthdraw their funds.. does lend itself towards the owner(s) being less then honest.

Whether it was a premeditated scam or a scam that was born from low revenue.. that&#039;s irrelevant to me. The end result is the same. They took off with people money. No sympathy here from me (and I&#039;m assuming many others). They had &quot;it in them&quot; the whole time to runoff with the money. Different from the long-con, but perhaps my choice of words were poor. &quot;Predisposed scammers&quot; would me more appropriate.<br /><br />The bittersweet component to this entire debacle is that IF another black market such as SR or Atlantis does pop up, people will NEVER trust it. Not after seeing how Atlantis went down. This shores of Silk Road&#039;s &quot;stock price&quot; if you will, which of course is good for DPR and the admins and even us community here. But like DPR said, competition is healthy and more black markets are a sign of a thriving free-market mindset. The irony is, nobody will ever &quot;experiment&quot; with another Atlantis like market again.

				Indeed, whatever the full story it seems obvious that the founders of Atlantis were, and are, a bunch of unprincipled money-grabbing bastards.<br /><br />I hope this doesn&#039;t stifle the creation of other markets too much, though. I do think that a little competition in this area is good for everyone, for many reasons, and I&#039;d be a little concerned if SR were the only game in town.
