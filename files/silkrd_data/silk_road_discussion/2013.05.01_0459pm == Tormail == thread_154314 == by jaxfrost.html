				it seems to me (anyone that knows better please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) an emal that lets you sign up with no real identifying info, lets you create. new account AND access your email through tor would be good from a privacy standpoint right?&nbsp; you just have to make sure and only get your mail while in tor browser.&nbsp; based on that I recently got an account with safe-mail.net.&nbsp; you just have to make sure people also only send you mail from tor and use pgp.&nbsp; I know that&#039;s a lot of ifs and make sures but that&#039;s the best I&#039;ve come up with. anyone else?

It effect the way you can be in touch with SR customers.<br />Almost every vendor has it on its profile.<br />So it is the closest link to people who need to contact you from SR.<br />That makes it a SR discussion <br />If read by 530 people or so now....well there is an interest I would say. Even if the subject is posted before.<br />Always wonder why there is always a person wining -nasal sound- &#039;&#039;you cannot be here, its not right, you should do this...or that&#039;&#039; <br />Or whatever the person feels is right for that moment and they have nothing to do with it anyway !! &#039;&#039;you cannot sit here&#039;&#039;... why not? do you wanna sit here...no ...then shut up<br /><br />Anyway....<br />Trying to get to my mail<br />DATABASE ERROR: CONNECTION FAILED!<br />Squirrel Mail Webmail or Cube...none works.<br />It is pure random able to log in.<br />Now I got to Squirrel, able to give my login code etc.....ERROR: Connection dropped by IMAP server.<br /><br />Hope the whole SR and TOR connection is fixed soon, this cost everybody orders and money.<br />Like I said before, this is probably why the attacks are there in the first place.<br />Not a random hacker, for them there are more interesting targets I am sure....<br />The US government. police FBI whatever is made a fool by this SR market.<br />Its in the news, they cannot do anything about it.<br />Nothing to stop SR from being very successful, not able to have real arrests or something ...only this attacks....and THAT is very effective.<br />If they keep it up....a few months and all the drug buyers have found other markets like there is already ATlantis.<br />A (good) vendor can sit on its items...wait till all is cleared up again. For me, no problem wait/not sell 1 or 2 months<br />A user needs his whatever he his hooked on.<br />Again, that is why we also NEED TOR!! to stay in touch......<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
