				Hi there SR.<br /><br />I have ordered a package two weeks ago and it still has not arrived.&nbsp; My auto-finalize is in 14 hours.&nbsp; I have been in contact with the vendor, and he assures me he will re-send another package when he returns from his vacation in two weeks.&nbsp; While I trust the vendor and I have no reason to believe he/she will screw me over, would it still be better/safer to go into resolution?<br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t mind finalizing for this vendor, he is a good person, good quality product and EVERYONE else seems to have gotten their orders.&nbsp; I just got unlucky.<br /><br />So my main question is, if I go into resolution, will it automatically hurt my reputation, or only when a refund takes place?

				if your refund rate is at 0 now when you resolve if u decide on a certain % refund then you will have a ?% refund rate based on like how much your getting refunded as opposed to how much total u have spent or sumthing very close along those lines.<br />

A time extension is indeed what u want and will NOT affect your refund rate. use it and keep using it until the product arrives or the vendor turns out to a be a scam ;) <br />

				if you resolve it depends on the value of the product you are resolving. I have roughly 700-800$ in purchase history and had a 150$ package go missing from shizofreen and he is no where to be found so I had to have SR come in and now my 0% jumped to 20%.&nbsp; I wish there was also a category of how many refunds you have asked for, so the other vendors could see it is a 1 time thing instead of multiple times

				Was this a domestic transaction or are you and the vendor overseas from one another?&nbsp; You can damn near deduce the reality of the situation with a little fact finding if you&#039;d care to share the details.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes if you look through a sellers history, you&#039;ll see the occasional 2,3 or 4 out of 5 and this typically leads to an honest seller but not necessarily a seller who has their shit together entirely.&nbsp; The next figure to take into account would be the number of transactions the seller has under their belt and for &quot;how long&quot; they&#039;ve been doing business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to share, if you want.<br /><br />Good luck either way!<br />O
