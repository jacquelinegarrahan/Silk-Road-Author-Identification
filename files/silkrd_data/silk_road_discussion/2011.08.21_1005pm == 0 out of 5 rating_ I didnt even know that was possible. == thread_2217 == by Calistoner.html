				That happened to me when I attempted to edit feedback, I find that when I edit feedback it takes me to a blank page when I hit submit and best bet is to simply close that page and the feedback will remain. Refreshing or hitting the back button on that blank page resulted in the 0/5 rating.<br /><br />But I just went back and changed it. In your case, I&#039;ll echo the suggestion to contact SR.

				i contacted SR and they said that it happens and its a bug they cant figure out. they also asked me if i had asked the buyer to try to change it, which of course i have so it just a waiting game i suppose.<br /><br /><br />if he doesnt change it in a few days i wonder what will happen ???
