				because the vendors agree not to sell anything intended to harm or defraud. and weapons frequently are used to harm people, especially those obtained anonymously <br /><br />it brings additional negative publicity as well. <br /><br />see the thread in off topic about the article on the armory to get an idea about the shit it starts (which by the way is evidently not the tor market that was closed buy a legit licensed dealer in virginia beach according to the ATF lol)

				I use weapons to feed my family, is that a less noble cause than getting high?<br /><br />OP, they took down the weapons site mainly because there was only one vendor on it and no one used it. Their official answer was they didnt want bad press, yknow, cause selling black tar heroin is good press. Long story short weapons are largely legal and easy to acquire so there wasnt any reason to have a black market for it. If you ask around on the armory forum you might find people still selling, but theres no escrow system to regulate it.

Guns themselves do not harm or defraud. They are just a tool and can be used to protect and defend just as well as harm and defraud. I believe the quoted lines were present in the Seller&#039;s Guide before the Armory was closed. They do not pertain to guns. The guns were excluded later and for a separate reason.<br /><br />If people are wondering why no weapons are allowed I think it is correct to give them DPR&#039;s reason, since he is the one making the rules around here and made a point to be clear about the reason. It is an injustice to tell them that gun sales were banned for something that is not the correct reason. The link above to DPR&#039;s thread &#039;Closing the Armory&#039; gives the info right from the source (link worked for me).<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone clicks on DPR&#039;s forum username, and then follow the link &#039;read all posts by this user&#039;. The links in his signature are also very interesting.

I am genuinely saying that I see your point and I made some wrong assumptions.<br /><br />I strongly support the idea of something like the Armory. Like you, I speculate it was the negative attention that got that side of things shut down. I also speculate that DPR is a proponent of the right to bear arms, so the wording in the Seller&#039;s Guide shocks me to say the least.<br /><br />You left out the most legitimate use: to remain, as a collective, stronger then the government. We should not sacrifice our liberties so that the government can better &#039;protect&#039; us.

				S - I kinda read his statement as having the right to bear arms, and it being a symbolic &quot;strength&quot; against the gov to maintain the liberty and right rather than the gov telling its citizens they can not own guns. but given where I am from - this seems common to me<br /><br />F1 - appreciate your respectful response.&nbsp; i agree i think it seems DPR is probably for the right but he wants it to remain separate from SR as to prevent the complications (like negative media attention, ATF investigation, potential violent consequences) associated with the armory from potentially bringing the Road down... if you notice DPR&#039;s post the reason the armory was closed however was simply because it was not getting enough traffic and sales to make it worth the effort and cost to maintain keeping it up. it wasnt negative publicity that closed it down - i think its negative publicity contributing to why DPR doesnt want weapons on SR
