				Well I only smoke weed and usually buy an ounce at a time which would last me about 20 days.<br /><br />Running out doesn&#039;t bother me much because it&#039;s just weed so I usually smoke til I&#039;m out then buy more. Plus waiting for it in the mail gives me a nice little tolerance break.

				I guess it depends on your drug.. I take Benzos and Opiates, but i have a RL connect that goes by the name DOC.. So im good if SR goes down but i wont be able to get the funner things in a active drug users life who likes a wide choice of drugs like i do.. But hey iv lived ? years without SR i&#039;ll make it if it went down..

				If SR is your only supply, and it goes down forever, then you are gonna run out.<br /><br />You can hoard and manage and all that,&nbsp; but you will run out unless you find another supply.<br /><br />I spent my time dealing with making sure I have what I need.&nbsp; Now I taste when I want an escape.<br />If I don&#039;t have it then I will be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do see a doctor for a prescription though.&nbsp; Not gonna say what it is but that is my &quot;connect&quot;.<br /><br />

				My current supply would linger for 6 mo to a year, but I have a rl or know where to find things in rl so I&#039;m not worried bout it.&nbsp; Only thing I&#039;d be worried about is, I know the quality of the stuff on here, out in the streets I&#039;m taking a guess and putting faith in people i have a weird relationship with.&nbsp;

				6 months or longer, which is good because I have let my offline connections lapse since discovering SR, and I would need some time to build them up again.

				benzos ~2 months<br />psychedelics could be stretched to ~ a year, but will probably only last ~ 3 months at current consumption rate :)<br />all others - my supply is more than I will probably use in 10 years, but it is my practice to remain armed to the nines just in case&nbsp; 8)
