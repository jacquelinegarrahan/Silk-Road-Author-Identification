				It&#039;s been said of him before that he starts off with the old...<br /><br />ilovedeath: &quot;Hi I want to buy your [insert product ] listing but I&#039;m .25 BTC short. Can you loan me the BTC?&quot;<br /><br />My guess? He&#039;s of Middle Eastern descent. Why? The name. Think about it for a bit. It might make you chuckle. <br /><br />In any event, if you happen upon this charlatan or like minded ones of this sort, a simple test you can pose to ferret out the truth of the matter:<br /><br />Vendor response: &quot;ORLY? OK. Let me make you a custom listing for the [insert product] that is .25BTC cheaper. But you will have to finalize early. S&#039;okay?&quot; If you&#039;re a vendor like us, a real client would have read that we don&#039;t ask or compel one to finalize early. A real client would retort with, &quot;but I thought you said you don&#039;t require FE?&quot; This character retorts with, &quot;OK how about .13 then?&quot; <br /><br />You could also point such a character to the &quot;official spare coins&quot; Thread in off-topic. Though I would hope no good soul there would be taken by one such as this. But they&#039;re a bright bunch and can smell a rat around the corner. So I have every confidence that they would spot a poser. <br /><br /><br />Right then. Now you know. Back to business and sorting out our affairs to best serve our Patrons. Massive weekend and SR being down yesterday threw us for quite a loop. Such is life on the darknet I suppose. But the good news is lesson learned. The bad news is that our patrons have to endure experience&#039;s test. <br /><br />

				Yes, about a week ago they tried it on me as well. I told them they would probably have enough soon with bitcoins rising so fast, but, If they wanted to, they could send me all their Btc and I&#039;d be sure to ship them what they deserved :-)

				Poor guy, I know what it&#039;s like to be a little short... he&#039;s offered to finalize early and doesn&#039;t mind if I go a little light, seems legit. I&#039;ll send .2 and see if he makes an order&nbsp; ;)
