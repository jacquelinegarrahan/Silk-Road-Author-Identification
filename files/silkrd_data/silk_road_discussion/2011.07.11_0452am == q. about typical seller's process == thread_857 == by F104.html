				The vendor should be communicating with you, sorry for your experience thus far.&nbsp; Once an item is ordered the vendor is notified in their orders section,&nbsp; the vendor once the item is in the mail is supposed to click &quot;in transit&quot; and it will update the listing on your account to show the item as in transit.&nbsp; You are correct after 4 days of being in processing the buyer is given the option to cancel an order.&nbsp;

				yep...mostly pm your sellers, and if you get worried, it&#039;s o.k. to start a thread on a particular seller: sometimes they jump in...I&#039;d always show a little patience tho...hesitate to just &#039;cancel&#039; orders without checking with seller...you don&#039;t want to get rep of a problem buyer, either...have you set up PGP yet, and know how to use it...and encrypt your address, when seller gives public keys?<br /><br />And again, mostly a little patience and things usually sort out...sellers often have lots of diificulties on their ends, too...I usually pm after about 24 hrs if they haven&#039;t acknowledged order yet...

				Some sellers will mark it as in-transit pretty quickly I&#039;ve found but then contact you giving shipping options.&nbsp; When it first happened to me I was kinda annoyed as it has been &quot;in-transit&quot;&nbsp; status for several days, but the seller did keep constant communication up which is better than some other vendors.

				In my experience so far its hit and miss. I currently have an order from a known good seller but its been stuck in processing for more than a week. PM sent to seller has not been responded to yet. One other in this forum just confirmed they are having the same experience and is similarly just waiting it out. <br /><br />Its not great but it happens. Happened to me before one time. A product I wanted took almost 2 weeks to ship out from a known good seller (who is no longer on SR). All attempts to communicate were not responded to but before the order they were extremely communicative. Then it went into in transit all of a sudden. Yet still all communication was not responded to. I received it fine and good product.<br /><br />For me, if the seller is a known good seller I give them the benefit of doubt if I want the product. If I can do without it or if I don&#039;t trust the seller, I cancel when they do not respond. The escrow system allows buyers to take a chance. Maybe the seller is just having a bad couple of weeks or whatever. Because of escrow, I&#039;m ok waiting it out if I don&#039;t smell something wrong. Worse that could possibly happens is I loose half the bitcoin but so far, knock on wood, I haven&#039;t had to hit mediation yet.<br /><br />

				If you bought something from me and I had not said anything to you about after 4 or 5 days and you cancelled I&#039;d have nobody to blame but myself.

				I actually lift escrow on sellers I trust...trying that out, see how it works...if they&#039;ve come thru once or twice, I just finalize as soon as it&#039;s shipped, and say: &#039;trusted seller, lifted escrow&#039; ...but I also agree that it&#039;s on me.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t come thru, I can attempt to contact seller and work it out, but othewise, I&#039;m just SOL...but it seems like a fair thing to do...these forums have been really helpful, and I think we&#039;re all trying to sort out how to make this work, without getting burnt, but without putting too much of the burden on sellers, either...

				i think bitcoins fatal flaw was not making it mandatory to have each member placed on a map automatically...and emphasizing it...to allow face to face transactions...yeah sure there are two dedicated sites for it,with fuckall users...only bitcoin can implement such a task
