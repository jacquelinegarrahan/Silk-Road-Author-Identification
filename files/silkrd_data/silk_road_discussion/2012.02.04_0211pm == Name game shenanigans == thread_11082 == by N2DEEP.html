				Using a different name on the forum than your SR account wouldnt be a problem. Im just saying the winner should have to have a buyers account with a purchase. I also think that any forum account established since the contest announcement shouldnt be eligible unless they have made forum contributions beyond that thread.<br /><br />one entry per 30 minutes was one of the rules....but if someone is using 30 accounts to make a post a minute....<br /><br />shenanigans!

				i can understand where you are coming from and some people are doing this but for me i signed up to the forums after the competition started. i&#039;ve made one or two purchases on the main SR site and have viewed the forums for help before but never felt the need to sign up and submit a post.<br /><br />since the competition started though i now feel like its about time i got a forum account.

Lots of people dont use the forums...or dont bother registering. But its pretty clear that theres some fishy biz in the contest.&nbsp; I just wanted to bring attention to the issue. <br />

				<br />I registered this account on the forum just for the contest, but I have some 30 transactions with 0% refund rate on SR. I don&#039;t think I should be disqualified for that reason, but it&#039;s also obvious that there&#039;s nothing stopping a team of 10 friends making 60 accounts and posting every 30 seconds. The rules should have been thought out a bit better.

				I totally agree about people spamming it up.
