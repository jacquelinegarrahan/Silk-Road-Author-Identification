				I thought that it might be cool to have a thread where we post news, articles, blogs, etc discussing Silk Road.&nbsp; After all, we should probably be aware of what &quot;outsiders&quot; are saying about us.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.foxbusiness.com/on-air/stossel/blog/2011/06/02/digital-currency-libertarian-future-0 - &quot;Digital Currency -- The Libertarian Future?&quot; by John Stossel.&nbsp; This one is hilarious because they use a story about a guy named Mark.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Mark, a software developer, had ordered the 100 micrograms of acid through a listing on the online marketplace Silk Road. He found a seller with lots of good feedback who seemed to know what they were talking about, added the acid to his digital shopping cart and hit &quot;check out.&quot; He entered his address and paid the seller 50 Bitcoins - untraceable digital currency - worth around $150.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL @ 100mcg of LSD for $150.&nbsp; Mark got ripped-the-fuck off.&nbsp; But, I digress...<br /><br />http://c4ss.org/content/7361 - &quot;Bitcoin: With Enemies Like Schumer, Who Needs Friends?&quot; by Kevin Carson<br /><br />http://c4ss.org/content/7410 - &quot;The State, Put A Fork In It&quot; by Thomas L.

				Good reads, those.&nbsp; I like seeing what non-participants have to say about the idea.&nbsp; The idea is powerful.

				I didn&#039;t know that a TOR site could be blocked with an internet filter.<br /><br /><br />&quot;The government&#039;s mandatory internet filter, which is now on the backburner, could have been used to force ISPs to block the site, but as it stands there is no way to prevent Australians using it.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/lifestyle/technology/tech-news/govt-cant-stop-postman-pots-online-drug-trade/2276310.aspx

				Might be a bit cynical, but hey- speculation is half the game in a libertarian market: I am certain that the UK&#039;s Daily Mail will latch on to the Silk Road story at some point. For those of you not from the UK, this paper is statist, right wing, sensationalist dross. I can imagine the headlines, &quot;The site where YOUR white middle class children are peddled evil drugs- what every parent MUST know.&quot;. Of course this is going to whip up a shit storm of moral panic, alerting the nations youth to Silk Road and the UK BTC exchange Britcoin. The media attention will almost certainly drive the price of BTC up, as did the original wired article. I would say that the current slump is actually a pretty good time to invest in a few hundred quids worth of BTC...<br /><br />

The Gawker article gave the onion address, the link to get Tor, and info on bitcoin. So as a result there was large increase in BC price (it went up to $30). Granted you can still figure out how to get to SR with google, I think the average person is not going to bother. That&#039;s why the rate has stayed between $8 and $13 for so long.
