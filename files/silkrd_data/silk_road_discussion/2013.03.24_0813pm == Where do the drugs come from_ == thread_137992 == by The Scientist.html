				The streets of the country you seller operates in..? I doubt any of the SR products differ at all in their sources from normal drugs they might come from some of the countries you listed but only because they&#039;re drug hotspots I don&#039;t think it has much to do with their US foreign policy (well you could argue it does and leads to an economical shit state that pushes farmers to rely on opiate/coke production to make a living but thats by the by) actually looking at your list it&#039;s not the countries I thought, mostly south America, Pakistan, India and China depending on the legality and types of drugs.

				It was so interesting to see the shift of cannabis manufactured in South America and Nepal regions to now North America.&nbsp; &nbsp;North America now grows the best weed in the world.&nbsp; This shift took only 20 years of seed sales and hybrids.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can remember back 20 years ago when weed was commonly &#039;brick weed&#039; from Mexico that was weak and full of sticks and seeds.&nbsp; That was all you could get.&nbsp; &nbsp;There were no buds or skunk weed.&nbsp; <br /><br />And if you planted the seeds from the brick weed, they never turned out right because their growing season was too long.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then people figured out the indica strains from Nepal region were perfectly suited for indoors and north american climates.&nbsp; They stayed short with a short growing season from their natural mountain habitat.&nbsp; Those grew well in North America and indoors.&nbsp; They became medical grades and used for making hashes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then the grow your own revolution began.&nbsp; Grow equipment, fancy grow foods and hydroponic shops.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pot magazines and head shops.&nbsp; Seeds on the Internet and thousands of new strains and hybrids to choose from. People growing pot in their closets and spare rooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then another revolution unfolds finally; selling weed on the Internet through Silk Road.&nbsp; &nbsp;- Buy the seeds on the Internet, buy the equipment, setup the grow room, then get the Silk Road vendor account , harvest the crop and package and sell it on the road.&nbsp; Perpetual cycle of harvest after harvest and selling it on the Internet.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The days of cannabis cartels are over.&nbsp; Even gangs can&#039;t control the weed market.&nbsp; Everyone is growing and selling it now.&nbsp; It&#039;s value remains consistent due to the cost of electricity and growing supplies.&nbsp; The costs of growing expenses remains a significant factor.&nbsp; Outdoor weed never fetched the same high prices as indoor weed.&nbsp; Outdoor weed is cheaper to grow, but it&#039;s more vulnerable to theft and cops and also the elements of outdoors makes for poorer quality weed that sells for less.<br /><br />Weed now comes from your own neighborhood.&nbsp; It&#039;s grown there, sold there.&nbsp; Some weed travels around, but generally lots of its now local.&nbsp; Crystal meth was once a regional /local product that was made and sold nearby also.&nbsp; Now due to the scarcity of the ingredients, it&#039;s mainly manufactured in Mexico where pseudophedrine and ephedra are still available and cheap.&nbsp; The finished product now comes north while weed goes south .&nbsp; Neat.&nbsp; <br /><br />With Silk Road, people&#039;s weed grown all over is being shipped and sold around the world now!!&nbsp; Think about it. . . The local neighborhood grown weed is now shipped around the world on the Road.&nbsp; &nbsp;North America may be an international supplier of quality weed now.<br /><br />&nbsp; If you look in most countries were weed naturally comes from, their weed is crap.&nbsp; Wild weed is crap compared to domesticated hybrids .&nbsp; &nbsp;North America&#039;s hunger for better and better weed led to the great strains and quality we see today.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix would have been kept busy in their old age.

				Technically it&#039;s value lies in being illegal under many states and under federal law.&nbsp; The cost of production on weed is pennies on the dollar.&nbsp; That&#039;s why, as you accurately state, that anyone and everyone is doing it now.&nbsp; This is opposed to the other harder to make/obtain drugs.&nbsp; It&#039;s price is actually ridiculously cheap considering the legal risks still involved.

				the kind of shrooms I get you can&#039;t grow indoors. You can grow them outside with wood chips and spores/transplants, but only a couple months a year depending on your weather. psilocybe cyanescens is a cool weather species and only fruits below 40-50 degrees F and usually only in Autumn. They grow wild in wood chip landscaping on the west coast of USA. You can see photos and descriptions at Mushroom Observer<br /><br />http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/index_observation?q=19bgB<br /><br />psilocybe cubensis is the species you can grow indoors. That is a sub tropical species and fruits at room temperature. This is why nearly all vendors carry psilocybe cubensis and very few, as in only one, carry psilocybe cyanescens<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137992.msg941464#msg941464">Quote from: SouthSquareBiz on March 26, 2013, 01:48 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137992.msg935756#msg935756">Quote from: cyanspore on March 25, 2013, 01:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">the shrooms I get can literally come from your front yard if you have wood chip landscaping in the right area.
