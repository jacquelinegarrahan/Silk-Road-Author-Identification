				Hi,<br /><br />I have been dealing with SRdn666 exchanging Bitcoins for cash via Western Union, 230 Bitcoins is the transaction.<br /><br />No contact from him since he has received the Bitcoins (6 days ago), which is why I am posting here. I will wait 24 hours and if still not response I will post all details, if SRdn666 replies I will edit this post to reflect his reply.<br /><br />I do not want to destroy someones reputation if there is a valid reason for his non communication after I transferred the Bitcoins, however I do not want to loose $2,500 quietly or have anyone else loose.<br /><br />SRdn666 please respond to emails, SR messages or on here.<br /><br />SC12<br /><br />

				Ok, update time.<br /><br />Hours turned into almost 2 days.<br /><br />He got back to me with a story about his money guy getting caught by police for an unrelated issue and of course his money guy had all my cash ($2,500) which he was supposedly about to send.&nbsp; <br /><br />He made an offer that basically said I&#039;ll try and pay you back when I can but has no idea on time. <br /><br />I emailed him and asked what times he can repay the money. After 3 days I HAVE HAD NO REPLY!<br /><br />Now his SR account is in stealth mode, I can only assume this is done so that no one can see when he is online.<br /><br />Right now I would highly suggest do NOT deal with this man.<br /><br />If he replies to my email I will update this post.<br /><br />Its a shame that people like this spoil the silk road experience.<br /><br />SC

				I already mentioned it somewhere, also in feedback!<br /><br />The vendor SRdn666 should be AVOID for any MONEY service!!!<br /><br />The guy selling also no-contact debit cards.<br />The bank from which these cards are, supply them same way like every card you ever got for your account in your bank:<br />So in SEALED letter, glued to paper with additional informations related to account and the PIN which as you sure know is under some plastic foil you need to remove and look opposite to light source...<br /><br />...but this imbecile will send you just and only the card! So he open your letter, keep the information, remove plastic that hide PIN and these information send you later in PM.<br />I do not know if he is incredibly stupid or what to doing that!<br /><br />Excuse for Polish folks, but he is as classic polish i ever deal with - total noob and AMATEUR! simply dick.<br />Will not better even mention how long order from him took before sent it, so he must keep address so damn time although he lied it was sent already so market in transit and customer information were already deleted from SR.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM SRdn666, he does not deserve such profit for such poor and stupid services...<br />...but on other hand he would be a good Nascar rider :D

				Ok, a few more days have passed and absolutely not communication from him, this leads me to believe he has STOLEN my $2,500.<br /><br />He is a LIAR and a THEIF.<br /><br />DO NOT USE HIM FOR ANYTHING unless you enjoy loosing your money.<br /><br />Repeat: SRdn666&nbsp; CAN NOT BE TRUSTED OR BELIEVED.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />SC
