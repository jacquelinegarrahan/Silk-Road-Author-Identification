				Seems like I am always having problems connecting to SR. Right now I can&#039;t get to the log in page and even the forum was timing out. I was only able to get on here from my ipad. Gets annoying when I have orders to place and orders that need to be finalized.

				It most likely isn&#039;t your hardware/OS causing the access issues. I recommend selecting a &#039;new identity&#039; and retrying. You will get through eventually.

				It is not just you. For the last week or so sr has been very difficult to connect and if connection was possible, still very slow. It is annoying to have to spend so much time for nothing. I&#039;ve been trying&nbsp; to get on sr to process orders for the last hour but it&#039;s impossible.

				Same here, It&#039;s been extremely difficult to get on the SR.&nbsp; Is there a major influx of new members or something?&nbsp; Too many users on at one time perhaps?&nbsp; <br /><br />I kind of wish SR would close off to any new members, and move URLS again, as some asshole has posted youtube videos for the whole world to watch and figure out with extreme ease how to get on the road.&nbsp; It was supposed to be difficult to weed out the idiots but now any jack-ass can get on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can&#039;t anyone keep a secret anymore?

				As the forums say, it is not you having problems it is mostly everyone. Registration has been closed but still the site rarely lets you get through. Lots of problems for members at the moment but nothing we can do about it. BTW, the poster referring to macs, It is not OS X that is keeping you from connecting... it is the road.

				Maybe it doesn&#039;t like your turtle-neck sweater?<br /><br />:-) Just kidding - but someone had to make fun of the Apple fans. ;-)

				See your firewall setting? proxies settings, for a while my start up page wasn&#039;t showing (you are now safe to brows ...)<br />then I just adjusted a few things and hey presto.
