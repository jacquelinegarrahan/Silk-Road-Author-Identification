				Can&#039;t take them more often.<br /><br />I just got some cid from JC.&nbsp; Been looking for it for so long and now SR has brought it to me.&nbsp; I soooo want to drop one right now, but I&#039;m exhausted from the week and so don&#039;t think I&#039;m in the right mindset.<br /><br />I got a stash of psychs now, 2CB, MDA... but I have to wait &gt;&lt;&nbsp; And even then, I have to space my trips out due to tolerance.<br /><br />Shit sux... what drugs are good to take on a regular basis (i&#039;m a light user btw, I dont take heroic doses).&nbsp; And not EtOH or THC, I&#039;m sick of those.

				you could smoke dmt daily without building up a tolerance, so long as you leave about half an hour between each session. i&#039;d assume 5-meo-dmt works the same way as well. :)

				I suppose it can be an annoyance, but also a part of the inherent beauty of psychedelics. My belief is that the psychedelic experience is not over when the compound has been broken down and left our bloodstream. On the contrary; that is when the period of deep meditative reflection should begin. The conscious experience is only half of the experience to me. Understanding the rest within one&#039;s sub and unconscious minds is simply the next stage to the process.<br /><br />Yes there are the psychedelics like DMT which do not have a noticeable tolerance, but constant use would seem mundane in my eyes, and one would get lost in the euphoric muddle of psychedelia without a real understanding of the experience and its lessons, if one is seeking learning. There&#039;s a reason why many of these drugs leave you more than just physically and mentally drained, it&#039;s simply the time to find out why. :)<br /><br />But to answer your question, DMT sounds like what you&#039;re looking for. Although you&#039;re not taking heroic doses, be sure to expect a herculean experience. If you&#039;re not experienced, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll think twice before dosing again.<br /><br />

				I think the fact that you can&#039;t do certain psychedelics so close together due to tolerance is actually a good thing for me, I feel like it teaches me patience and the importance of moderation which is something that I have always struggled with.

				I&#039;m not sure, <br />is there a cross-tolerance between mescaline and LSD? <br />If not, that could be a nice way to go: lsd once every 2 weeks and mescaline once every 2 weeks (up to you if you take them together or not).

				Haven&#039;t tried DMT yet, although I have some pharmahuasca. You could smoke a bit of Salvia d. a couple of times a day - I actually had a 3-day weekend where I did this, but only with 5X. There didn&#039;t seem to be any need to wait nor was the next bowl less potent. For me, being stuck in phychedelia-land too long was a problem - it might be cool for a few hours, but if I had to go somewhere (like to get some food) I could not and would not drive, and depending on what I was tripping on, would I even want to be out in public? Try navigating around your own room on Salvia &amp; you&#039;ll see what I mean. Acid isn&#039;t quite that way, but you can only trip every few days.

				Oh hey, someone who shares my complaint.<br /><br />Psychs, neurotoxicity of MDMA... can&#039;t seem to catch a break. Louts get drunk every other night and I&#039;m waiting a month to candyflip.

				Great thread!<br /><br />So, we have tolerance, having to come down to this so-called reality, too few people tried ...<br /><br />Let me throw in my personal bugbear - trip duration!<br /><br />Of my favourites - acid, mescaline and DMT - all of them are either very long or very short.<br /><br />Acid with 8-12 hours does take me for an amazing ride, but also by the end leaves me wishing that it would just let me go to sleep and enjoy it! Mescaline is a little bit better, but still requires at least a day for all in.<br />But both are really great drugs that give me something of value on pretty much every trip!<br /><br />DMT is the opposite - I feel like I live thru a Big Bang to today in a space of seconds... Nothing can be brought back though, which is disappointing.<br /><br />I would love to be able to find a substance that will be like acid but would take an hour or two of this time (there I do not mind it to be an eternity)<br /><br />Any ideas? I have read about shorter-acting substances like 2C-B, 4-ACO-DIPT/MIPT, but they seem to be a lot less involved than acid or DMT.<br /><br />May be you, honourable part takers, can help me?

				ayahuasca is great and only lasts 3-4 hours.&nbsp; you can get a lot out of it and then get to sleep when its done.<br /><br />same with chewed salvia divinorum.&nbsp; its a deep and quite intriguing experience that is over within a couple hours of your last quid.&nbsp; its a totally different kind of psychedelia tho.....not as scary as when smoked, and easier on the gastrointestinal system than aya.

DMT is where it&#039;s at but it&#039;s in a different league all together and may not be what your looking for.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend looking into the 2C-x&nbsp; range of chemicals as they are shorter acting &amp; able to give close to LSD feelings... Though personally I ended up with mild HPPD after a couple weekends on 2C-E - didn&#039;t abuse it hard but was defo left with &quot;flashbacks&quot; (HPPD) for a few weeks, nothing bad, it was mostly pleasant but I gladly havn&#039;t noticed it for the past few weeks so nothing permanent.

				I&#039;ve found myself having trouble taking them at all recently. <br /><br />Psychedelia is my favourite genre of substances.&nbsp; The journeys I have tend to last from 6-16 hours (depending upon the substance and dosage); on top of this, it usually takes me a while to recover (as I have to reintegrate, spend time in contemplation, scribe my experience, wait for myself to fall asleep, and then spend time sleeping).&nbsp; <br /><br />Being fused into the social constructs of university and working merged with living on my own while struggling to find time to visit my parents back home doesn&#039;t allow for me to immerse myself in such experiences as often as I&#039;d like.<br /><br />I had extracted DMT many months ago and finally got to try it for my first time last week.&nbsp; I surely received intense visuals, which lasted 5 minutes, but I don&#039;t think I broke through.&nbsp; It was too short, extremely whimsical/mystifying, and a tad confusing.&nbsp; Though, the duration of this substance should allow me to visit psychedelic realms more regularly.

If you can meditate well it will greatly improve your trips, it makes your mind much more open to the experience and allows the ideas to come to you. I don&#039;t want to say it makes you better at tripping, but .... no that&#039;s exactly what I wanted to say. If you can control you mind, then you can control the trip. Meditation is key.

In this day and age nearly all of our minds are on overdrive, and it takes real discipline and dedication to achieve a real balance and control of one&#039;s mind.<br /><br />The best advice I can give you is to observe your breath; don&#039;t focus on it, simply envision in your mind the Oxygen or life-force energy, whatever you wanna call it, and see your lungs in your minds eye expanding, and contracting, expanding, and contracting. Try it without meditation, just observe your breath as you&#039;re surfing the web or whatever, and it&#039;ll become a habit for you where it becomes 2nd nature and you do it naturally. Also, breath diaphragmatically. Meaning breath with your diaphragm so it inflates instead of just with your lungs.<br /><br />Meditation is a beautiful experience, and I feel everyone should practice it one way or another.

Everything happens for a reason my friend. I have always believed that DMT is a medium between realities. Not just the vessel between them, but actually present in two realities at the same time. When the time is right, you&#039;ll be able to experience the true glory of the spice. Just know that a breakthrough is so alien, so otherworldly, that nothing can prepare you for what you&#039;ll experience. The only advice I&#039;d like to give you, is don&#039;t give into amazement. As profoundly incomprehensible as the entities you encounter in hyperspace are, they have messages for those who listen.

The ideas are within reach, but the emotional resonance is gone, and that&#039;s what makes the experience, for me. <br /><br />If you haven&#039;t tried writing, give it a shot. Like many people, I write little comforting notes while sober to anchor myself while tripping.

No, I&#039;ve written trip reports on mj, LSD, shrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, and 25C-NBOMe. Not always with great success - I find trying to write on NBOMes viscerally unpleasant. But get me in front of a keyboard and I&#039;m gold. I don&#039;t post much of this stuff, but recently reviewed a bunch of it and found very little that was unintelligible or outright crazy (though at times a little repetitious). I like the conversation I&#039;m having - not that I necessarily *trust* what I have to say on every substance, but it&#039;s interesting. And I know I would have forgotten a bunch of it had I not taken it down, which lets me focus on slightly different things next time. It&#039;s also, incidentally, permitting me to take a very long view of doses, setting, and effects, which was the original purpose.

				It is kind of a pain in the ass having to plan out the time, wait for free time, and stuff like that. I usually wait a minimum of a few days bewteen minor doses of shrooms when I grab like a half ounce. Psychedelics are definitely not good for every day use. Especially not if you are taking enough to have mind / personality altering effects.

Tolerance for amphet&#039;s builds much too rapidly for my taste. Other than that, I couldn&#039;t hardly consider MDA a psychedelic. 2C-B is in the same category. Extreme cross-tolerance with amphet&#039;s. And amphetamine tolerance, once significantly built up, can be permanent. <br /><br />Try some tryptamines. Not only are the trips stronger and more fascinating (IMO) in many aspects, it seems as though tolerance is not gained as quickly. They are just more &quot;natural&quot; feeling, from my experience, and leave far less of a body load. Not to mention they have a shorter duration and you can sleep on them.<br /><br />I&#039;ll admit, I had a hell of a trip on 2C-B (50mg) and 25-I (about 2-3, maybe even 4mg... crazy, I know) and some cannabis. I was seeing the most wild colors and tracers. My cieling was morphing into a tablet covered in crazy, alien writings that were constantly changing and bursting with color. DOC is toxic for me, but again, I&#039;ve have had some of my most intense, otherworldly trips on it.<br /><br />&nbsp;I was able to take 4-ACO-DMT four times in a week once. Funny, I started at 40mg, then went to 20, then back to 40 and 40. Quality every time. Also my favorite all around psychedelic.<br />Maybe just pick up some DMT and you could lose your mind everyday.<br />But then again, abuse psych&#039;s of any kind and they will abuse you. They&#039;re not meant for the impatient. And that&#039;s from first hand experience, btw, no judgements.<br /><br />
