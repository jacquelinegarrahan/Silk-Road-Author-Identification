				Appeared with confirmations? I only ask because I can see the amount in my wallet. It&#039;s just that there have been no confirmations. So I can&#039;t move it on to its next destination. <br /><br />I wonder if this has anything to do with instawallet&#039;s security breach.

				Check to see if SR support actually read your message. On your SR account click messages then sent. If your message sent is bold, they didn&#039;t open to read. <br /><br />I&#039;m going on 18 hours and they haven&#039;t read the message yet nor has anything been solved yet. 0 confirms still.
