				Hi guys, has anyone else started getting annoying messages from various accounts in your forum messages that try to direct you to some bitcoin exchange (real or imaginary I don&#039;t care).. here&#039;s how they read:<br /><br />฿10 bitcoin=$79.99 [ www.mtgix.com ] trade in 5 minutes accept paypal and creditcard&nbsp; ฿<br />฿30 Bitcoin=$169.99<br />฿50 Bitcoin=$239.99 www.mtgix.com<br />฿100 Bitcoin=$449.99<br />http://www.mtgix.com ฿<br /><br />Any way the mods can disable these accounts?<br /><br />I already received these from account names:<br /><br />aavrerehre<br />mooi34 <br />vber3 <br /><br />The last two are &quot;guest&quot; statuses. Perhaps guests shouldn&#039;t be allowed to message members.<br />

				yeah, i received pms from them too, they are scamming fucking assholes, anyone that does any business with them are mugs.<br />this forum is getting more and more like topix every day, all the exposure silkroad has been getting lately has brought an influx of new people and a lot of the scum from topix and other shitty seedy sites, 4 or 5 months ago most of the people on the forums were always happy and polite with each other, now just look at all the bitchiness and hate going on, there are some people on the forums if you look through there posts they have nothing good to say about anyone or anything, thats what we get when silk road has been over exposed in most countries newspapers and lots of new people start using the site, just my 2 cents worth, but the forums used to be a happier place a few months back.&nbsp;

People come here, know exactly what There doing (drugs=illegal) and then concise some complicated plan where you get your gram of weed delivered to your next door neighbours/friends house under a fake name while referring to yourself as SWIM&#039;s magical rainbow unicorn. Plus the fact that SR users think there more important then they are, sure this thing is fucking awesome and has exploded in popularity, but it still only makes up something like 0.00000000001% of the worlds drug trade and suddenly everyone is LE. If Topix is still up and can be found on fucking clearweb google, why would they denote so much resources to us?

As a Vendor, and the amount of money to be made as a Vendor on here, you should seek to act as professionally as you would <br />in any sort of business. Forget how you would operate on the street and think how you would operate as a legitimate business and in any business customer service should take a high priority, as these people are the ones paying your bills. Professionalism in the drug trade is EVERYTHING that SR stands for. It is suppose to allow the Intelligent to operate the drug trade and not the Thugs who have done the most damage to the image of illict drugs as a whole. <br />However, it seems like with all the media publicity and how to guides etc the dregs of society are starting to finally filter there way in here, so in this sense i would suggest you keep some street sense about you (and by this i mean mentally, and not by threatening customers with your physical anonymous internet presence) and remember the customer is NOT always right. I think a combination of this is what will really separate the Men from the Boys in the Vendor Scene when SR (or the concept in any form) really explodes.<br /><br />BC

				Oh no I don&#039;t mean to say vendor&#039;s can act like the fuckwits on the street, it was more a way to let people know they&#039;re dealing with a single person in an enviroment that is not always in control!<br /><br />Like:<br />Complaints about orders not been dispatched quickly enough (I&#039;ve had compaints after 12h)<br />Giving bad reviews because, even though the package arrived, it wasn&#039;t quite as stealthy as they would have liked (not happened to me but seen it)<br />Shipments not arriving for some reason, and the seller DEMANDING a free reship, unwilling to take any of the burden (I always do reships because my product is very cheap, but for people who ship large items, or expensive stuff like coke, it&#039;s painful).<br /><br />etc. etc.<br /><br />I try to do things as properly as possible, even going above and beyond in some areas, like reships no questions asked, and pretty much all packages are overweight, to compensate for other areas people might not quite like (my shipping methods get called on sometimes but I can&#039;t do much about that yet).

				Agreed on the level of paranoia around SR lately - seems it&#039;s the price we have to pay for finally getting a worthwhile access to substances for everyone worldwide. And I guess it&#039;s up to the more senior members of the site to incorporate the newbies and show them how we respect each other here - for example in the threads I&#039;m participating in I recognize by now the different members and feel like I&#039;m participating in a very nice community - instead of some random meaningless internet fad. This is what the newbies need to learn.
