				Hi everyone, as I&#039;ve been reading this forum over the past several months, I&#039;ve really come to appreciate how much valuable knowledge is contained in this little forum of ours, even with the deliberate misinformation that gets posted (e.g. Tor is a GOVERNMENT HONEYPOT!1!1!). As long as you know how to take everything you read with a grain of salt and confirm what you read with reliable academic-based outside sources, the information here is pretty incredible, thanks to everyone who&#039;s contributed to this forum in a positive way.<br /><br />That being said, if the Silk Road were to ever be shut down, the information in this forum would effectively lost. So I&#039;ve decided that I would like to create a simple mirror of the forum to store on a local drive for my own use in case that were ever to happen. I would obviously lock the mirror down with several layers of encryption using different passwords of over 50 random characters that would never be written down.<br /><br />So I guess my question is this: how much storage space would I need? I can&#039;t imagine I&#039;d need more than a Terabyte, but does anyone know how much space I&#039;d need? Or better yet, a way to find the size of this domain myself?<br /><br />Also, would a &quot;wget -m dkn255hz262ypmii.onion&quot; terminal command be all I need to do to create a local backup? I only want to collect the actual forum posts that can be accessed without logging in. Would this do the trick?<br /><br />lol, I suppose I could always just ask LE how they create their mirror of the site I&#039;m certain they keep somewhere, but fuck the police.

				I guess the size of this must be about ten hard drives?<br /><br />I did copy some of the posts on the coke washing by some poster plus how to make oil and other useful things like how to get bitcoins and using this linux thing some use.<br /><br />It would be sad to lose all this as I have never joined the forums in the past!!!!<br /><br />So now maybe I wont get scammed.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />I never knew about the rumour mill!!<br /><br />SR should make you join so you can be safer buying!
