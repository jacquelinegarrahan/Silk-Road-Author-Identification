				Hey there Roadies. We recently placed an order with a newer vendor and within 24 hours it was marked as &quot;In Transit&quot;. Thinking to ourselves &quot;Yay, bud should be here soon!&quot;, we left it to be (as we normally do, we never contact vendors unless it&#039;s absolutely necessary). Six days later and still no package (average turn around is 3-4 days, tops, every time we have ordered). Earlier tonight, we contacted the vendor regarding the situation and we were informed that 1) the package was never shipped and 2) the vendor is getting out of the game. He instructed us to cancel the order....but we can&#039;t. There is no option to do so since it is already labeled &quot;In Transit.&quot; Seeing as how this vendor has our money tied up in escrow now, we can&#039;t even put in an order with a reputable vendor. Since this vendor has admitted his wrong doing and mishandling of this order, is there any way to send this to resolution faster? 4 days is a hell of a wait (especially after waiting 6 just to learn the vendor never shipped the product) and we aren&#039;t sure how long this would end up being in resolution for (never had to take that route). Thanks for reading and for any help that can be offered. Also, if we posted this in the wrong section, many apologies.<br /><br />-ThEOVCollective

				Sadly your dealing with a really shitty vendor.<br /><br />I would suggest you copy and past his response and send it to support.<br /><br />Also contact that loser again and tell THEM to cancel it as they can do it.<br /><br />Sorry this happened to you.<br /><br />Order from NorCalKing...... you won&#039;t have any problems.

That was the first thing we did when we logged back in and saw their message; replied back and asked that they cancel the order. For some reason, we doubt it will be quick enough for us to sneak in a new order before the weekend. If the order isn&#039;t canceled by tomorrow morning, we&#039;ll contact support. Hopefully it won&#039;t take too long to get all of this sorted out. It&#039;s just a pain in the ass having our hands tied in situations like these. BTW, good recommendation with NCK. Our clients are still asking when we might be able to get some more of his Pink Panther in, and that was MONTHS ago! <br /><br />-ThEOVCollective

				Shoot, if I were you I&#039;d just be happy you can still get your money back.&nbsp; Use the Resolution Center, wait a few days as necessary, then re-order.&nbsp; Sorry but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much you can do at the moment.<br /><br />Sorry to hear the vendor didn&#039;t at least refund your order, but honestly things could be a lot worse.
