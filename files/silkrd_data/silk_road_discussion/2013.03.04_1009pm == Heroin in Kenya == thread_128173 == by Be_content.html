				Hello! I am telling a bit of a personal story here, but there is a message in it for aspiring Americans who want to make fast money.<br /><br />I had live inside of Nairobi for 18 years, and left Africa when I was 24 years old, I moved to America and then left when I was 27. Inside Kenya I had tried H because it is cheap to be fair.&nbsp; H is only a couple dollars a gram and yes weed is free. maybe if you are white they may charge a few shilling for a gram, but this is just a hustle. You can buy a bag (they dont use scales) for maybe 20 USD, they bag probably has a pound or so in it, the weed is not the strong stuff people grow in their homes and dry in weird ways. But when im in America it is so expensive for H, maybe a few hundred dollars a gram or so... I had never tried in America.&nbsp; so I go back to Kenya last month to visit friends and family, and I think to myself, if only I could magically bring the H in Kenya which is very cheap and easy to get and bring it into America.&nbsp; But this is impossible because nobody works, postage doesnt work, everything gets stolen, corruption is high, the niggers are hungry and people dying fast.<br /><br />So I seen a thread about going to Columbia and getting cocaine.. although I never been there I just want to advise that you aspiring young men who wish to make money in these ways reconsider. I have lived in third world country and first world, they do not operate the same ways, you may be street smart but you will be consumed. I want to let you know that even if you are the same skin color and speak the same language, they will know you are not local (just like the Americans know that I am not American) and will not trust you. Unless you are local, it will not work. Even if you are local, it will not work.&nbsp; Please do not go down this pathway, it is a very bad thing and on a side note the kenyans hate american gangsters so if you are stupid enough to try this (trust, you are very stupid) then be a business man.&nbsp; This is all my knowledge i can give on the topic, if i thought i Could do it, I would have done it. ok Cheers.

				I thought they had famine and lions in Kenya, didn&#039;t realise Heroin had got there yet. <br /><br />Try injecting Heroin into a Lion and film it, that&#039;d be fun to watch.
