				So I was thinking.<br /><br /><br />I would say about 75% of the people that are getting scammed are NEW customers who have no idea what is going on, they get scammed then start messaging SR Staff for help, and takes a lot of time for SR Staff, and devastates the new customer who will probably never come back, and not to mention the heartache and pain they went through.<br /><br /><br />I really wish DPR/SR will post upon a newbie signing up, that they HAVE to visit the forums. Then where they have the discount 10% off for a limited time, do another reminder to be careful Fe&#039;ing and to please read the forums before doing so. I think we will see less people getting scammed.<br /><br />Anyways have a nice day<br /><br />Nuggets5

				Good point .<br /><br />It takes a certain kind of attention to detail and intelligence with computers to stay safe here.&nbsp; I think most people scammed are really too stupid to be doing this type of thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was this flood of people over the past few months who don&#039;t seem to care about things like security.&nbsp; They use their real face as avatars, no PGP, noobie vendors shipping carelessly and it goes on&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems this last wave of people coming here are really careless and seem to not care about prison.&nbsp; Like they&#039;ve been there already and it&#039;s no big deal.<br /><br />Previous waves of people were middle class upper class people with jobs and famies. Moots to loose and lots to protect.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, the two groups are Mixed together and there is trouble. <br /><br />The last wave of people seem to Be the Walmart / trailer park demographic.&#039;&nbsp; Not very bright at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I think it could be futile teaching those who just don&#039;t care.&nbsp; They will put the rest of us at risk. So I agree with you 100%

				Absolutely valid point. But as a newbie myself, I have noticed that a vast majority of vendors - even the most reputable ones will not do business with noobs without FE. <br /><br />How do you go about this then? Is it a catch 22 situation? Vendors have a lot to lose when dealing with new customers,, I understand that, but on the flipside it is naive fools that are getting scammed by FE to new vendors who are gone overnight.<br /><br />I myself was forced to FE my first couple of orders - and this is very common pattern among coke vendors. Some of them request FE under almost any circumstances. So how do you solve this issue then?<br /><br />Peace,

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As far as babyshiva goes, thank you for your input. I agree with you! As long as they visit the forum and know that, the vendor they are about to buy from is actually a reputable vendor, then they are safe. I once Fe&#039;ed from darkexpresso for over a 2lb over bc he needed the coins and I glady did bc of his rep.&nbsp;
