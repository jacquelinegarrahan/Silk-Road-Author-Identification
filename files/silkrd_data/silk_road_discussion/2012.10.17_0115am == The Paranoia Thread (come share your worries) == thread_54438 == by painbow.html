Where Is My Shit??!!&quot;&nbsp; <br />my shit had finally arrived and i felt like i needed some good drugs after that roller coaster.&nbsp;

				Definitely feeling for you, painbow.&nbsp; I waited on a package for three weeks before it arrived, and without a doubt, every single day of those three weeks was a fucking nightmare.&nbsp; It was absolute mental and emotional torture.&nbsp; And the screwy thing about the whole mess was that the package was shipped exactly when the vendor claimed (verified by postmark) but it had just gotten &quot;lost&quot; in the USPS system.&nbsp; <br /><br />Despite receiving my order, I have not placed another&nbsp; ever since.&nbsp; There&#039;s just no way I&#039;ll put myself through that again.&nbsp; I humbly admit that my nerves can&#039;t hold up to that type of pressure.&nbsp; It definitely takes stones to use the USPS to receive a Schedule I controlled substance, and that experience just made me realize it was beyond my capacity to deal in a healthy way.<br /><br />Anyhow, I hope everything works out.&nbsp; Do your research on these forums and be reasonably cautious.&nbsp; And if you feel as if you&#039;re starting to lose it, find an &quot;anchor&quot; who can provide some perspective for you so you don&#039;t get lost in a maze of paranoid meanderings.&nbsp; Good luck!

If the postal inspectors and cops went after every person that they caught having drugs coming to their house by mail they would be broke. And based on the fact you ordered domestic (good move) the odds are low. I suggest you research controlled delivery methods to be up to date (it can give you a few mins to flush if you know what to look for) but like I said they don&#039;t usually go after &quot;personal use&quot; amounts.<br /><br />Always check your packages for evidence of opening/re-sealing, if it shows up empty don&#039;t worry unless its a big order, but usually for big busts they replace most of it with a fake &quot;look a like&quot; for evidence preservation and to prevent it from getting to customers. Almost all of us experience this stuff at some point, in fact the shroom man himself helped to calm me down after a shipping problem like this.<br /><br />I wish you well, but if its out of your control just do what you can do and don&#039;t worry about what you can&#039;t control. If its been a week in transit from a domestic vendor PM them ASAP. The most important thing is to remember that anyone can ship you drugs, doesn&#039;t mean you knew about it or asked for it!! So deny deny deny and make sure they can&#039;t tie you to the road, and you can get out of the charges if any at all. <br /><br />Hope I calmed your nerves a little but if not take crackheads advice and smoke some weed :)

				Listen, they are coming for you. I need you to listen to my instructions carefully neo.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about it. It&#039;ll show up eventually. I once had a domestic order take two weeks. When it finally showed i couldn&#039;t belive it was actually post marked two weeks prior. I thought the vendor been dicking me around.

				It sometimes stresses me out that the platypus numbers are reducing in some parts. We need more of them to make the world a more harmonious place. What a magnificent animal!<br /><br />More wetland protection! Better water quality! Protect the Platypus!
