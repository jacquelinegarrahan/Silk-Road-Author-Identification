				So, The Hidden Wiki is an... &quot;interesting&quot; place. Disregarding some of their more... distasteful links, the link to Silk Road is constantly being replaced by phishing links - I&#039;m sure this isn&#039;t news to a lot of you. I&#039;ve just spent the past couple hours reverting edits made by phishers, one of whom is very interesting - has the user name &quot;Silk Road&quot; on that wiki and claims his purpose is to restore the &quot;real&quot; link to Silk Road after it&#039;s changed by phishers. Naturally, what he&#039;s really doing is replacing the link with that of his own phishing site.<br /><br />Anyway, does anyone feel like patrolling the revision history of The Hidden Wiki with me, and making *some* attempt to keep the correct link there, so that we can at least save a few of the more naive or new users from having their accounts hijacked?<br /><br />* http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=history - this is where you can see the most recent edits.<br />* http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=12227 - this is the last good revision that I&#039;ve made.<br /><br />Of course maybe I&#039;m fighting a losing battle, and if noone&#039;s interested that&#039;s all fine, but I figured it was worth asking :)

				Good idea.<br />Buy the way, I noticed the Silk Road link is in the REAL wikipedia! I think it&#039;s the real address, not a phishing link. And the article says that you need a Tor browser to access it. Other than that, it doesn&#039;t have too much else.

				Why the fuck do idiots keep bumping ancient threads? &gt;:( The Hidden Wiki has never been dependable and is victim to constant vandalism anyways, so for the sake of staying safe either memorize the link or visit the actual clearnet Wiki page for the legitimate link. I&#039;ll be reporting this to be locked.
