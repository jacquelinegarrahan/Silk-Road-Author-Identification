				Today I deposited I think $251 USD on bitfloor. I figured they were still charging 1 percent, but now that I re-look I have noticed its 1-4% I guess based on how much you deposit, anyway I ended up with 236 instead of the typical 250. By the way even if it was a 4% percentage I still dont think that adds up to why I would end up with the USD amount: 236.xx.<br /><br />&nbsp;I had to go back out to the bank to put 20 more bux on to place this order uggh. Whats up with this anyone shed some light?

				Well to understand it you sort of need to be talking the same language. You are not buying $250 worth of bitcoins you are buying bitcoins worth $250 at the time of purchase. At current market value that would be about 2.8 BC. By the time you get them into your SR wallet you will still have 2.8 BC but that might be worth anywhere from $5 - $500 depending on where the bitcoin market decides to go. I haven&#039;t bought from Bitfloor before but most of the time when I order coins I am told how many coins I am getting and that&#039;s how much I get regardless of where the market takes them or what I paid for them.<br /><br />Obviously there are other fees possible too. With Bitinstant I need to uncheck a box to &quot;wash&quot; my coins or they put them through a few different transactions and charge me more for the privilege.<br /><br />Hope that helps a little.

				If you&#039;re buying at the market price you&#039;re paying for the Ask Price which is higher than the Last Price. Take a look at Bitfloor&#039;s order book, sometimes the Ask price is $80 but the size is only 0.1 btc so it will keep going up the orderbook and in price to fulfill the amount of btc you need.

Anyway yes, I think I need to study how bitfloor works a bit better because I think I did buy at market price (80 or whatever). When I saw my statement on bitfloor it said +250 USD , then it said something like -30 ; $230. <br /><br />If you guys look though on bitfloor.com you will notice on the deposit page the percentage fee has changed from the 1% solo amount, to 1-4%, I think my ignorance of things could be half the problem, then that. Look into it for me. That 20 dollars I had to go back and deposit was a complete waste of time. <br /><br />I will be more BTC buyer aware now tho for sure. <br /><br />PICS<br /><br />http://tinypic.com/r/k21bhs/6 -- bitfloor new percentages

				mtgox i got issues with, i don&#039;t like their terms of service, and also the ID photocopy or whatever. This bitfloor percentage increase just happened this past week. I&#039;ve deposited every week at least once in the last 3 weeks+ but the most only being $155.xx or so . Its always been 1% till now. I just dont understand , I knew I had $2.xx on my SR books, I needed $250 for a zone of dank, I put in a deposit slip for $252.xx and only came up with $236.xx once it hit SR. I sent the money straight from bitfloor to SR&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, my taste for risk is very high

				Dam, <br /><br />I though I was the only person to notice that change.<br /><br />Yup so its been about few weeks now sense. <br /><br />From 1%-4%.... is a big surprise.<br /><br />I noticed I&#039;m being charged..... 2.75%......... for my order.<br /><br />So now....that&#039;s not much better then.... BitInstant.com <br />Then I do Market Order, and get charged more for the fees...<br /><br />It still beats BitInstant.com... by a bit.<br /><br />(3% Bitfloor) is better then (3.9% BitInstant and ZipZap fees)<br /><br />1)I guess, they either had to much business to handle, OR <br />Decided to the same thing as BitInstant, and gain Max profits.<br /><br />

				Haven&#039;t noticed any big difference to be honest. I usually request deposit amounts and cancel them until I get a better deal. I never just use the first deposit amount that they give me. It will always be different. I&#039;ve seen pretty significant differences and saved some money by doing that.

It will give you all the instructions you need after that. Basically all you do is go to a BoA and ask for an out-of-state deposit slip (assuming you don&#039;t live in NY) and then fill it out with all the information they gave you. All you really need is the account number and the EXACT amount they tell you to deposit. You can just read the account number to the clerk and she will fill it out for you. Give her the cash, get a receipt, done. Money will be in your account by the time you get home.

At first I lost maybe a dollar or three. Now im losing 8-15 depending on the deposit amount. I&#039;m doing an instant market buy, I dont got time to bs, time is money and if i need to get an order out I gotta do a market buy, I also know nothing of bitfloor and the way to get a cheaper price if someone could ellaboratted i&#039;d +karma and send 2 dollars of BTC meaning 2$ USD<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bitfloor doesn&#039;t charge for the transfer it&#039;s Localtill that charges that specific amount so they know it&#039;s you who&#039;s placing the deposit, sort of like a account number. I always did this when I first started using them. Place a deposit and if you don&#039;t like what they are charging you. Cancel and place another one with the same amount, you&#039;ll notice it&#039;ll either get more added or cheaper.. Keep doing this till you&#039;re satisfied. But, I noticed lately when I make a deposit of $600 the lowest fee I got up to was $3-$5 ...Before it was nice because I always got to hit $1.50, once even $1.02.<br />Just keep cancel and try again, it&#039;ll show a different amount each time

				Bitfloor is expensive due to the people who are trading on there..But, it&#039;s also the quickest way to get coins, for me at least and I&#039;m pretty sure others can agree. Bitinstant is great when it wants to work...I like using bitstamp through bitinstant but, they screwed up last time and made me wait 3 days for my funds because they had insufficient funds in their account, keeping customers in the dark, not replying emails, phones...Not very professional if you ask me. I rather pay the little extra, so when I get home from the bank the funds are already there for me to spend on coins.

				Do you guys know if there&#039;s any action I can take if Bitinstant decides they don&#039;t wanna pay me? It&#039;s been 10 days since my deposit and they have still not deposited my funds to Gox or really shown any sign that they are gonna give me my money.
