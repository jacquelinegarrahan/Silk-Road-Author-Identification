				i know street dealers with a lot of customers who have sold their mobile phone line for thousands. so i&#039;m thinking a good sr seller account with lots of rep would equally be a very valuable asset. is it possible that the sellers that go rogue, or at least some of them, have decided to get out of the game and sold their sr account onto somebody who then just went and scammed everyone. is there any way to know?<br /><br />just a thought

				There&#039;s no way to know for sure, but it&#039;s certainly a possibility.

				i&#039;m guessing there wouldn&#039;t be much you could do about it either, not with the anon thing going on.<br /><br />even more reason not to FE tho

				Selling vendor accounts is permitted, so it&#039;s not something we&#039;re trying to stop at this point in time, but it should reiterate the importance of - as you said - not finalizing early AND always using PGP.

				It&#039;s definitely done. There&#039;s other sites where they are sold, they even have &quot;new&quot; accounts that come preoloaded with a month&#039;s worth of feedback. <br /><br />So the work of getting established is done, the orders are picking up, and it&#039;s worth it for the vendor that want&#039;s to just get in there and vend without all the hassle of building a customer base.<br /><br />I guess as long as they remain good vendors, there&#039;s really no harm. It&#039;s just another niche of unregulated capitalism, that works! Thanks to SR!
