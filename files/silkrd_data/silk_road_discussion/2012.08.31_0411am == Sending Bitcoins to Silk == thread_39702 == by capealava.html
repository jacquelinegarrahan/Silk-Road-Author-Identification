Intersango have all your details and you are sending it right to silk road.<br /><br />At least have a wallet in between Intersango and SR, Intersango are known for co-operating with police and will not hesitate to pass your details on. As for the OP,&nbsp; try changing the address you send it to, you can do this on your account page.

				@capealava<br /><br />More than likely you just need to wait until the transaction is confirmed on the block chain, this takes 6 confirmations.<br /><br />@firefrets999<br /><br />That is a really bad idea. Especially if you&#039;re using that account more than once. And even worse if you&#039;re doing it on clearnet. And worse yet again if you&#039;re using a bank account or credit card or whatever to fund the account. <br /><br />The problem is that if SR was compromised, and the bitcoin addresses used by specific accounts was obtained by LE, then there&#039;s a direct link between you buying drugs and your bank account. Yes really. Bitcoin is only as anonymous as the way in which you use it, it&#039;s not anonymous by default like the way the Tor network is (actually, you can screw that up as well, but that&#039;s a different story).<br /><br />I have a Anonymous Bitcoin use tutorial in my signature, read that! <br /><br />First though, you should delete your Intersango account and start over.

It&#039;s possible that you missed a character or else copied an extra character when you were highlighting and copying.<br /><br />I would recommend that you take Pine&#039;s advice very seriously, and also read over any threads within the Silk Road forums that they point you toward.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
