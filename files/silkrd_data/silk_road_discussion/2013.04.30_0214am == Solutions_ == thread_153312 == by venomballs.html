				I was actually thinking before the update: to suggest splitting up the user database alphabetically maybe? usernames starting with A gets it &quot;own&quot; website, B... C... D...<br />This would divide the traffic into 26 sites/domains... add the second letter and you have 676 websites to attack... <br />Different parts of the website get hosting on different domains maybe? Not a pro at this myself.. but sure some of us are. <br />I am quite confident DPR will eventually be able to fight this off.. at least to retrieve our funds. But my bet is on SR surviving this overall. Even if things are starting to look gloomy, there is always a way out! We can get the idea ball rolling.<br /><br />A question I actually had was: the forums seem to be decently easy to get to once again... how come? is the attacker concentrating on SR again?<br />If so: why? Does he benefit from us using forums? Is he putting all his resources in to attacking the site it self? What is going on?<br />My theory, like many of yours, once again: competition or LE. But still I am somewhat perplexed. What is this game being played? <br />What exactly is so special about this DDOS attack? Since the part 1 of the fight - what has changed? How come we came out on top, but ended up being fucked again? <br />What solutions are possible? How can we help? What tactics can we implement as a counter-offensive/defensive strategy? like many have said.. a lot of smart people on here. I am sure we can come up with something! I think if things aren&#039;t looking good, our leader should eventually be able to reach out to the community.. or we reach out to him? there is nothing impossible if you put your mind to it. We have thousands. <br />Personally.. I wish I could do more to help. All I can do for now is provide my support and believe in the cause that is freedom. believe in SR.<br />That being said: Fuck you DDOSer. Go get altarboyd.

				interesting info TwoHat. once again im not well versed in this shit but interesting nonetheless. 3rd one suggests changing/complicating the infrastructure and weeding out the ddos flood on one of the branches from wat i understood? <br /><br />@tea_drinker : mirrors still reflect to the actual website tho no? couldn&#039;t an attack be directed through them or even directly at sr-central? <br />also: vendors and buyers? dont think many people would be up for that. even mods... imagine if some LE gets on to even one of those? wouldnt they be able to essentially spy on the traffic going through? tht wud be bad. <br />maybe setting up a couple or more hidden (non user) mirrors that split the traffic and weed out floods? + the playing with the configuration of the host it self?

There would be nothing to DDOS hosted on the main domain. Hm is that even possible?<br /><br />Ok to be honest I have no idea..
