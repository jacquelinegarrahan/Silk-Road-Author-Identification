				I got the email too, I&#039;ve pasted it below. But what is unbelievable is that a lot of people already sent money to that address.<br /><br />Total Received &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;666.09491561 BTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Final Balance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175.044855 BTC<br />1F48CymZsof76oZob8UiCAaz7P4yUdnz7M<br /><br />------------------------------------<br /><br />Good morning Silk Road vendors and buyers, my name is Inigo. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Silk Road.<br /><br />Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week, and that there has been some strange goings on since it being back online. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this, many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.<br /><br />I will tell you that domestic rate options are one (choose to view in EUR &amp; GBP as well as USD) and also a new exchange feature will be implemented next month. We have also added more admin accounts which will be better staffed to assist you.<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. This can all be verified with DPR&#039;s forum post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138016.0 Or message him here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/b1e30b5819 Please do not speak about this on the forums yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; Dread Pirate Roberts share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200&#039;000 per month or $2&#039;400&#039;000 annually Shares will be priced at $500 for a 0.1% share, paid in btc (see below) at Mt. Gox&#039;s weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.<br /><br />There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types.<br /><br />Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your SR account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.<br /><br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it.<br /><br />Payment address - 1F48CymZsof76oZob8UiCAaz7P4yUdnz7M<br /><br />If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.<br /><br />Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging SR Financial here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/733d1d49e8 with your Transaction ID, User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total btc sent.<br /><br />Example<br />Subject - SR Investments<br />#277349296<br />Inigo<br />4 x 0.1<br />à¸¿29.20<br /><br />This is strictly first come, first served. As, said before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.<br /><br />Thank you and good luck<br /><br /><br />Inigo<br />SR Staff

				Wait wait.. Wait a minute.<br /><br />I have THREE kind of these messages in my inbox, all 3 different usernames and deposit addresses:<br /><br />The first message is from &quot;SR Staff&quot;, the second message is from &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; and the third is form &quot;STAFFInigo&quot;<br /><br />Since i lost 2 btc last week with the SRAdmin scam, i didn&#039;t fall into the &quot;STAFFInigo&quot; message again. It&#039;s OBVIOUSLY a fake, because of the no spacebar in the name.<br /><br />But..... are you guys telling me that &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; and &quot;SR Staff&quot; are scams too? How the f*** can a scammer get access to an account with a SPACEBAR in the username. And wasn&#039;t &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; the offical vendor support account????<br /><br />..?? Can please anyone confirm that they are all scammers ? Or is &quot;SR Vendor Support&quot; real ?
