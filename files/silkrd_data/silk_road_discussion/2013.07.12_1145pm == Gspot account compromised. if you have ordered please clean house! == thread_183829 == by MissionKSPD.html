				I live in the same town as the owners of Gspot and know, through a friend, that their account has been compromised, and their homes have been under surveillance for several weeks. If you look at the forums they (and their alt account which is really easy to figure out) have been ordering bulk MDMA pills.<br /><br />The owners, one of whom I know personally, have been bragging about being Silk Road vendors at dance parties and pissed off more than a couple of people. GHB in small town USA is a big deal. I messaged Gspot (and their buyer account) about the fact that one of the people they pissed off being a fucking cop&#039;s kid, and they took down their listings and (stupidly, I thought) their Facebook accounts. I can only assume they are cleaning house as hard as they can right now.<br /><br />They then emailed me saying this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; I am unsure who these people are I recently purchased this account off Hack BB and will be setting up my listings soon </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see three things having possibly happened. Either they are covering their tracks in the most awkward manner possible, or they have been arrested, or they have sold their vendor account and the account cannot be trusted.<br /><br />I&#039;m a Silk Roader for six months now and I wanted to warn the community that if you have ordered from them in the last few weeks you need to clean house right now. I am happy to give proof to Silk Road administrators, but pretty much anyone who has received from them can look at my name and verify that I know what&#039;s up.<br /><br />Be careful.

				I&#039;m confused here....<br /><br />If you know the account was compromised, why did you message it?... telling it that some dude whose dad is a cop, is pissed off at him.&nbsp; If it&#039;s compromised, you&#039;re talking to the compromiser.<br /><br />How could you have proof when you yourself don&#039;t know what happened?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m just trying to make sense of this, not flaming ya... but this just sounds illogical or something.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m interpreting what you said incorrectly?<br /><br />

				it&#039;s compromised as in the vendor is being watched, and has been for weeks. <br /><br />he shoots his mouth off all over town. i told him so he will have a chance to shut shit down (he did). but he also replied that he had &quot;recently purchased this account off hackbb&quot; meaning the account could belong to ANY ONE.<br /><br />thaht&#039;s why i&#039;m telling the forums too. everyone needs to watch out if they have ordered from Gspot.
