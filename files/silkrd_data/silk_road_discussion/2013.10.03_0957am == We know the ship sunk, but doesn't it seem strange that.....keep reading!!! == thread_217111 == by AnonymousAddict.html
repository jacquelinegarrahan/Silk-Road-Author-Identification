I JUST DONT SEE HIM DOING THAT,, SO HOW DID THE SITE GET SHUT DOWN SO FAST? <br /><br />DO U THINK MAYBE HES 2ND IN COMMAND FOUND OUT AND HE POSTED&nbsp; THE FBI NOTICE HIMSELF TO CLOSE IT FOR SAFTY THATS WHY MAYBE THE LOGO IS IN THE BACKGROUND? LIKE A CALLING CARD SAYING ITS STILL US BEHIND THIS BUT ITS GOTTA BE DONE THIS WAY THESE WERE THE PLANS IF ANYTHING HAPPENED&gt;???<br /><br />ANY THOUGHTS&gt; ? LIKE I SAID I FEEL HE WOULD OF HAD PLENTY OF MONEY NOT IN JUST BITCOIN CURRENCY EITHER..BUT HARD CASH IN DIFFBANKS ETC ALREADY THE BEST LAWYER PAID FOR ON DETAINER.FHE THOUGHT AHEAD, SO THING LIKE THAT ARE WHAT SEEM UNRITE TO ME.

				Have you seen a picture of the guy?&nbsp; He looks like he&#039;d squeal if you even looked at him hard enough.<br /><br />What do you not understand? That your pipe-dream that this is all some ploy by DPR to distract everyone from some silly secondary truth you wish existed, isn&#039;t real? lol<br /><br />They&#039;ve been watching his ass for a long time. And I am almost positive they had the server before they had him.&nbsp; What I don&#039;t understand, is why he wouldn&#039;t have a fry-all. A flush. A fail-safe. A raid-proof PC. <br /><br />Any decent hack knows what the fuck I&#039;m talking about. Apparently DPR doesn&#039;t. Shit, he probably still has all the porn he wanked it to still queued up in his browsing history!

				Lol@idealizing DPR and drug induced paranoia. <br /><br />DPR was a noob at the beginning of the story who made some noob mistakes. Even if he eventually got good at security, he still had been a noob in the early days. <br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had similar thoughts that the image was posted by staff/DPR because someone truly did get popped. If I were DPR, I&#039;d implement an emergency protocol that would be something similar. I would have some sort of portal on a separate server in which only trusted staff had access to. This portal would give access to a &quot;kill switch,&quot; so to speak, for the entire marketplace. This process would replace the login page, as well as all other pages on SR with a splash page containing the image currently shown, or perhaps the staff member would have a choice of images to choose from, dependent on what kind of circumstance actually created the need for an absolute shutdown. The current splash page has everyone freaked out, and I&#039;m sure a large majority of users have already cleaned every bit of illegal shit out of their homes. If something so serious as what I read read in the Criminal Complaint documents (http://www.scribd.com/doc/172766650/Criminal-Complaint-Against-Alleged-Silk-Road-Proprietor-Ross-William-Ulbricht) actually occurred, the aforementioned security measure would be an absolutely fantastic idea to warn everyone.<br /><br />Those are my thoughts.<br /><br />ALSO, ANONYMOUSADDICT, PLEASE DON&#039;T TYPE IN ALL CAPS... IT&#039;S HONESTLY THE MOST LIKELY REASON THAT ONLY TWO PEOPLE (THREE INCLUDING MYSELF) HAVE RESPONDED TO YOUR THREAD. IT&#039;S HARD ON THE EYES AND MAKES PEOPLE THINK YOU&#039;RE ONE OF THREE THINGS:<br /><br />1.) 13 Years old.<br />2.) Stupid.<br />**OR**<br />3.) A stupid 13 year old.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t take offense, I&#039;m just letting you know how the caps are perceived :D<br /><br />Love, Love, Love!<br />MushGoo<br />

				Wouldn&#039;t the SR main site have been mirrored entirely somewhere else physically? You&#039;d think that would be a no-brainer. And the mirror could have been updated with all the transactions from the database, if not on a daily basis, at least weekly.<br /><br />How hard would it be to install some kind of &quot;wake-up&quot; switch (either physical or software) that would make the site resurrect after a certain number of hours or days without contact from the main server?<br /><br />I realize I&#039;m talking here without the benefit of solid computer knowledge, but it seems to me this could have been doable. The only thing is that if the mirror wakes up and goes live, what would be the onion address of it? One of those that DPR published some time back?<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />goblin
