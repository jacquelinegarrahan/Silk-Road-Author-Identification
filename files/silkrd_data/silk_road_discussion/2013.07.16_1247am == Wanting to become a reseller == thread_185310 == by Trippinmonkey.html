				You heard that right.<br /><br />You offer me your product for what you paid for it to get your money back instantly.<br />After that it depends on how much I sell it for. If it is double what you payed for you get half of it. If it&#039;s more you get more.<br />Worst case scenario: you get back what you paid.<br />Best case scenario: you get a lot more.<br /><br />Please keep in mind I&#039;m not some moron that buys your stuff overpriced and sells it for insane prices.

				Why would anybody sell you their drugs at cost, just for you to sell it for more so you can give them a cut of your profit? Don&#039;t really think that&#039;s going to work.

				If you want to become a reseller, you will still need to have a vendor account.&nbsp; Please do not offer to buy or sell or resell anything here without one.

				The best thing you could do is get customers outside of SR to pay into your bitcoin account and place orders for them for whatever they want so you&#039;re acting as a middle man for people who can&#039;t or don&#039;t know how to use SR. Does that make sense or maybe that&#039;s too small time for what you&#039;ve planned?

Just saying, check it out, not a lot of people want to receive packages from south America.
