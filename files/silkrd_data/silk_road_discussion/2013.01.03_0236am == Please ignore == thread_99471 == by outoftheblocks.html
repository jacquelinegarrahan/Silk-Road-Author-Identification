				Yes, i see there is little need for panic, I have found the article to be more discuraging to onlookers than it is encouraging, so only those willing to endure the process, will enter into &quot;THE VOID&quot;! <br />Sorry for the Caps lock...

				&quot;And entering Silk Road requires a username, a passphrase and a PIN...&quot;<br /><br />They probably got phished writing their article if they used a pin to get on, haha!<br /><br />I like the part about URLs being intentionally difficult to remember too.&nbsp; Relative to all the useless shit we remember there isn&#039;t much to memorizing a short string of characters.

				Aha! Thats funny! &quot;A trip down the rabbit hole with Alice&quot; Awh! He sounds so boring haha! I suppose he even backs Silk Road up towards the end, saying that &quot;forumgoers are quick to pounce on bad posts&quot; Damn straight why on earth would you want child porn/assassinations on here!

				Yeah I think that article was pretty dope. She hit it right on the head on a lot of points, especially the comments about the forum. Since Silk Road is talked about all over, why not have more publicity, especially if it has a nice undertone to it.
