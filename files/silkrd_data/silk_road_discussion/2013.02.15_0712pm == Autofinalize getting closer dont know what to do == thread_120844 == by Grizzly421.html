				I am waiting on my first overseas order, any I am just days away from the AF date. I sent a message to the vendor 3 days ago, asking if he could check the tracking and let me know if it is just the mail moving slowly or if something is up? He has not read it yet. What do I do in this situation it is making me quite nervous. I don&#039;t think I am being scammed but almost wish that was the case so I could move on. <br />I am probably worrying for nothing, for all I know I could get the package tomorrow.

				Click resolve, and it will give you more time.&nbsp; Don&#039;t finalize, and don&#039;t let it auto-finalize.&nbsp; If you still haven&#039;t heard from the vendor after awhile, don&#039;t sweat it, just submit it to SR as if you were scammed.&nbsp; It&#039;s nothing personal.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t get the package, you don&#039;t get the package, and the whole point of the escrow system is to protect you in such a case.&nbsp; Go forth and do great things.

				Offer to extend the due date mate. The whole idea behind the escrow is to prevent you from being scammed. USe it mate!! Its your right!!<br />

				Thanks for the advice. I really don&#039;t think I am being scammed. With the bad snow storm in the NE and Valentine&#039;s day I am sure it is just slow going at the USPS at the moment. What I am really scared of is customs. I don&#039;t want to loose my receiving address, and I have other things in transit so I get really nervous about having anything arrive on my doorstep.

				I am always, always. always hinckey about buying international for this very reason.&nbsp; I have only bought domestic up until this point, and I haven&#039;t seen anything to change my mind yet.&nbsp; The United States is a big enough place to meet every one of my drug-seeking needs.&nbsp; And, offers of cheap drugs are usually offset by the dangers of the drugs never showing up at all, or by law enforcement interception, which could mean they DO show up, attached to a SWAT team.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to freak you out.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure none of that is going to happen to you.&nbsp; This is just my particular paranoia, and my Klonopin is a little late to arrive, so I&#039;m tweaky.&nbsp; Sorry.

				I ordered something that nobody seems to want to carry in the US anymore. Don&#039;t know why there seems to be a large demand for it. and my choice are somewhat limited as far as highs go. I take a drug test at least once a week. sometimes more often. So... I gotta take my chances and order from O/S or else go with out.

				Gotcha.&nbsp; Being former military, I still have friends who have to limit themselves to substances not on the list of what the DOD currently is testing for.&nbsp; Well, if the forum is an indicator, overall it&#039;s safe to order from overseas (maybe Australia is an exception, and there the risk is just not getting the product), and your stuff is probably just held up.&nbsp; Maybe if you take the &quot;no news is good news&quot; slogan to heart, you&#039;ll feel better about it, anyway.<br /><br />
