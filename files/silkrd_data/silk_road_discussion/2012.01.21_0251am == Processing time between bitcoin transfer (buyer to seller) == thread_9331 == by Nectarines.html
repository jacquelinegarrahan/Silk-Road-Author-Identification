				Hey everyone, I purchased some MXE from reiche just about 30 minutes ago and have been waiting on the &quot;Verified orders&quot; screen for this length of time as the status is set to &quot;processing&quot;. I was wondering is this the normal amount of time one has to wait for processing? Did my order freeze somehow perhaps?<br />My bitcoins have sure been deducted, so I assume that they have been sent over or are being sent over at the moment..

				Ive been researching the forums a little more on this issue and have come to the understanding that the buyer must wait for the seller to approve the transaction manually before the finalization process. Is this a correct understanding of how the system works?

				That&#039;s right.&nbsp; SR holds onto the coins until you finalize the order... at which point you can leave feedback for the seller.

The vendor then clicks &quot;confirmed shipped&quot; once he has sent your package out... Once you receive your package you finalize the order and the money will be released to the vendor.<br /><br />If a vendor requests early finalization you have to confirm the item as received before he will send the item. Do not worry though because you have the option of going back and changing your feedback from a 5 out of 5 to a 1 out of 5 if he doesn&#039;t fulfill his part of the agreement/sale.<br /><br />Let me know if you get it now or have any further questions<br /><br />Good luck in your ventures!

Then it&#039;ll be in transit. Once you receive it, finalize.

				Can I ask does the buyer have to ask you to finalise early before you see the option? I only ask because I have just made my first transaction and on the orders page I don&#039;t see an option to finalise early but below my order it says &quot;The finalize button is FINAL and cannot be reversed&quot;.<br /><br />Sorry for the newbie question&nbsp; :D

Under normal circumstances &#039;in transit&#039; should mean that it is in the mail, on its way to you and you should finalise when the item is in your hand. But as we know, many vendors want you to finalise before they will send it out, especially if you are a new or slightly risky user based on your history on the marketplace.<br /><br />
