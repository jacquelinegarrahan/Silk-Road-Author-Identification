				So some people are freaking out and over hyping the situation.<br /><br />-Forbes is mainstream media of sorts, while this means more people will be attracted to the site that isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing.&nbsp; As long as the vendors are somewhat competent this shouldn&#039;t really be a security issue. If anything happens at all (which it won&#039;t) it could be some vendors or customers getting busted because of lack of security and common sense.&nbsp; The smart ones won&#039;t get busted and the site will continue to prosper.<br /><br />-The article doesn&#039;t really present new information or information that couldn&#039;t be inferred. It was pretty obvious that when I discovered the site in like 2011/12 that DPR&#039;s username/handle meant that there wasn&#039;t just one DPR.&nbsp; It says DPR could sell the site if offered the right price but again that didn&#039;t need to be stated because those things happen all the time with &quot;legitimate businesses&quot; so why wouldn&#039;t that be a possibility with SR?<br /><br />-The &quot;feds&quot; have known about the deep web/TOR/SR forever.&nbsp; You&#039;re ignorant if you think that just because Forbes publishes an article that they&#039;re going to scrutinize this place even more.&nbsp; The mail has been a way of shipping drugs almost since it&#039;s inception, they know drugs are going through it and they do screen it. However,&nbsp; there have been millions of successful shipments of illegal things through the mail and this won&#039;t change unless the governments of the world put microchips and cameras in everybody&#039;s heads to read their thoughts and see what they&#039;re doing.<br /><br />-Atlantis blows.<br /><br />-Everyone loves drugs especially wealthy business men who read Forbes.<br /><br />-The influx of new customers will level out eventually. (But more traffic to the site increases the opportunity for new vendors, products, and SUPPORT for the idea behind SR.<br /><br />So guys: I really wouldn&#039;t be worried if I were you.&nbsp; The people behind DPR seem to be pretty intelligent and good people and wouldn&#039;t do this if the good didn&#039;t out-weigh the bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to leave your feedback/opinions and if you have any other insight into my post just share it!

				I agree with most of your points, except for the contention that &quot;everyone&quot; loves drugs. I liked the article / interview and am not freaking out at all.

				The process of buying drugs here won&#039;t appeal to a rich guy who can pick up the phone and have a kilo delivered to his doorstep in an hour....<br />Now new vendors... that could be a good option.

				Everything I&#039;ve read on SR has made me feel that buying cocaine on there is too inconsistent.&nbsp; Plus I would just re-sell but coke users are a lot more difficult to work with than MDMA users.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been laughing all the way to the bank ever since I found SR.&nbsp; Of course I don&#039;t ever tell my buyers where I get my shit from, and especially not *how much* I get it for... suckaz!

				As an American it&#039;s going to be hilarious if I ever heard to Europe.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be able to get that European MDMA for almost half the price and a shipment time of less than a week.
