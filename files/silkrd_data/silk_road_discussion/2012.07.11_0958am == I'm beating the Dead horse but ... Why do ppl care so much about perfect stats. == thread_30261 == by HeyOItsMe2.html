				Hello all again,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So I see this repeatedly that &quot;my stats as vendor or a buyer have to be perfect.&quot; Why do people care so much?<br />I am a buyer without perfect stats. However, I think is a good thing because it means multiple things.<br />and vendors without perfect stats are good too because it means multiple things.<br />They are:<br /><br />1. I will not finalize early.<br /><br />2. If I as buyer, and do not receive product I will expect you, as a vendor, to refund me based on your terms laid out on your seller&#039;s page.<br /><br />kinda guessing on the next cause I&#039;m not a vendor but...<br /><br />3. If I as a vendor, do see a relatively low refund rate, I will assume &quot;shit happens&quot; and either proceed with the order, cancel your order, or pm you to explain and decided from there.<br /><br />4. I will not let my stats scare me. I will not tolerate scammers.<br /><br />kinda guessing on the next cause I&#039;m not a scammer but...<br /><br />5. The buyer won&#039;t just finalize, so I&#039;ll wait for the perfect stat bulls-eye , and cancel this guy/gal <br /><br />6. The seller doesn&#039;t care if&nbsp; my one little feedback hurts his/her stats a little, I&#039;ll go to the guy/gal that has to keep it perfect.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />and finally I say if your stats are not perfect but work to keep them good.<br /><br />7. The system works!!!!!<br /><br />So anyone read this or am typing for the sake of typing?<br />oh yeah if your still there do you agree?<br />Is this horse dead?

				Perfect stats = less bullshit to deal with and when resolution time comes, who&#039;s going to be more believable? <br /><br />No only that but if you want to be eligible for samples and specials, perfect stats go a long way.

				Out of 41 orders I still have perfect stats&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I like to research all the vendors I use the best I can before I&nbsp; use them, that probably saves me from a lot of bs.<br /><br />And I&#039;ve never finalized early.

				I also am just guessing, but your stats are probably bad because you buy from bad vendors. Go figure..<br /><br />drevious

				I don&#039;t think vendors care about buyer stats that much except on bulk orders and as long as they&#039;re reasonable (&lt;10%) then it makes sense to sell to them.

				As a vendor, the only thing I really look for is a high cancellation rate because that is how I have been scammed. Otherwise, the way I see it, there really isn&#039;t much to go wrong. You buy from a reputed vendor, said vendor ships off product as described in a stealthy and timely manner, buyer receives product. 5/5 fb left. Pretty simple shit, really.

				I&#039;m not sure, you might try your account page. As a vendor, once you order from me I can see your total number of orders and percentage of cancellations<br /><br /><br />edit: account page, then purchasing stats

				brutusk, when talking about &quot;cancellation rate&quot;, do you mean &quot;refund rate&quot; or are the stats a vendor sees really different from what a buyer can see?
