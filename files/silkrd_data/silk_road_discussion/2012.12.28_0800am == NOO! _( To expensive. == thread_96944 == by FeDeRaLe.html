				i would count on the price dropping at all. It was raised to try and deter scammers from joining the community. If i were you i would save up the BTC to buy one. You could make a killing on here if u have good H for a good price.

				No man i was in the process of turning $150 into 12 bitcoins and then they fucking (X3ed) the price. WTF. I am not a scammer and am not gonna pay close to $500 for a sellers account.<br /><br /><br />I know how to ship, use PGP encryption, i have a bean with multiple drivers that give me cheap heroin all day, every day. <br /><br />I was going to have a hard time getting the $150 into BTC cause where i live it is really hard to transfer money to bitcoins and they just fucking made it impossible for me. I am not gonna risk that much cash exchanging to btc because i could get scammed and $475 is way to much.

				#1 i am skeptical of how many sales i could get over SR.<br /><br />#2 $500 could buy me like a fucking half ounce of dope that i could smoke.<br /><br />#3 2 weeks ago it was $150 like what the fuck???&#039;<br /><br />I was just about to buy it. <br /><br />$500 is quite a bit to me right now, i wasn&#039;t even trying to make a killing, I mainly wanted to sell so i could pick up larger amounts with the profit and get discounts.<br /><br />I&#039;m pissed now.

				Shut the fuck up. I live in a border state and can get it and sell it for cheaper than any other vendor is currently selling for and STILL make a profit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how many people on here can get FULL powder grams for $60 a pop and half grams for $30. You can huff on it and it is totally legit.<br /><br />I am just saying it is the most legit connection i have ever seen in my state and people beg me to give this connection to them.<br /><br />This has to be some of the cheapest, highest quality dope around. I know where to get $40 dollar a G dope but it is not nearly as good.<br /><br />TRUST me. I can&#039;t afford $500 dollars cause i spent all my spare money on smoking dope and i have money in a fund for college that i will not touch for drugs.

				No one wants a dealer that can&#039;t afford $500 vending fee.&nbsp; If you can afford it because you&#039;re so fucking cool, but just don&#039;t want to pay then why not quit bitching and simply go away???&nbsp; <br /><br />Cashing out bit coins is so easy, but getting them is difficult (In your area)???&nbsp; Keep posting and pretty soon you&#039;ll be naked because every post seems to show just a little bit more of your ASS.&nbsp; I&#039;m typically a very positive poster, but you got on my nerves quick.&nbsp; Man up or go away. <br /><br />A better way to say it &quot;SHIT OR GET OFF THE POT&quot;!

				$40 per G? Are you buying from the Queen? Holy shite. Seriously dude, 500 for seller&#039;s acc/ isn&#039;t as much as it seems. At first I was against it, but then the logic became clear. It&#039;s not THAT much. Even I could buy about 20 of them, and I&#039;m poor. (No don&#039;t ask me for a loan) <br /><br />Vendors tell me that initially it&#039;s hard to get going, but if you&#039;re even half-way good, and not here to screw some people out of a few coin, won&#039;t be a problem. I just spent about 500 on text books recently and that&#039;s only for about 2 years study worth. Being a student, you&#039;ve probably shelled out a fair bit too, and thought.... did I really need that extra book? Weekend binge? New clothes? Trip to the sex shop?<br /><br />Once you sell your first few you should be right. Don&#039;t let it discourage you, it&#039;s very do-able. Just don&#039;t sell to your teachers.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely.<br /><br />btw, what do you mean, impossible to get bitcoins now it&#039;s jumped? Shouldn&#039;t make a difference, unless you are trading bitcoins. Just use MtGox or so forth. You won&#039;t get scammed. Like somebody above me said (not literally, though I wish somebody was above me) how do you propose to deal with about 2 - 5000 worth of BTC or escrow if 500 is a bit tricky? If you are going to vend, be prepared for quantitative amounts of money arriving all at the same time, not just 40 dollars here, on Monday, 50 dollars there, on Tuesday. My writing has gone to pieces lately so I&#039;m not sure if this is coming out right btw. If I don&#039;t make sense buzz me. Also, I was asleep, but logged back on to say goodbye to Roxy, and now I can&#039;t find her because she&#039;s left already. God I hate my life.

Get off my post.<br /><br />The fuck should i pay $500 when i was already about to FUCKING pay $150? Don&#039;t be a dick gtfo. <br /><br />And how does somebody paying $500 to start selling make somebody a vendor DUMBASS?<br /><br />The whole point is to start small and build a business, if i haven&#039;t started yet than how the FUCK am i supposed to have money.<br /><br />Seriously get the fuck off my fucking post you dick.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, when you go to start a vendor account and it asks you to pay a large sum of money? If you have enough bitcoins in your account, it deducts them which is you paying the fee, then it gives you vendor status. It&#039;s like all this technology is some kind of magic, isn&#039;t it? :)<br /><br />The reason you should pay $500 is because you won&#039;t get a vendor account without doing that. It doesn&#039;t matter what you were about to do. You waited, you lost out. $500 is starting small, get it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I get what you are saying. But i can&#039;t get that kind of money up front.... We have already gone through this. They just tripled the price. If i sold like 7 grams or so i could easily pay the fee but even if i DID spend the money to make the account then i would have trouble filling orders initially.<br /><br />The whole point of starting a business is to have enough capital for the product, (acc fees etc) I don&#039;t understand why you think somebody who has a hard time with the start up costs is automatically a shitty seller with a shitty product.<br /><br />I have a car, would be able to deliver to the post office after picking up the dope, etc. <br /><br />I just don&#039;t have alot of money this second because i am a fucking student.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you don&#039;t have the money for the vendor fees how will you handle all the unexpected expenses as a vendor?&nbsp; Scammers, intercepted packages, samples (if you choose to start out that way) etc...? <br /><br />You said you could spend $500 on &quot;1/2 an ounce that you could smoke&quot;.&nbsp; If I were a potential customer (I don&#039;t use heroin) I wouldn&#039;t buy from you based on that statement alone.&nbsp; I would be worried that you might be using your own supply to get high.&nbsp; Also you are very angry at people who are trying to help you understand the reality of vending on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;Telling people to &quot;Get off your post&quot; doesn&#039;t instill confidence in your ability to handle customers.<br /><br />&nbsp;You should stick with school, you need to iron out some things before you start any venture, be it an online investment through Silk Road, or a job in the workforce.&nbsp; For example... &quot;Guaranteed&quot;&nbsp; NOT &quot;&nbsp; Gaurentee&#039;d.&quot;.&nbsp; No apostrophe needed.&nbsp; Many people make assumptions about the age and maturity level of an individual based on spelling and grammar.&nbsp; I would work on that and also on your ability to accept constructive criticism.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree, after this post if you ever became a vendor i would never buy from you. You have no business sense AT ALL and if you have the best dope connection and cant afford 500 bucks to triple your profit over and over then you cant understand what a Investment is. Kinda like what your college money is sitting there waiting to pay for your education and hopefuly give you a clue.. Good luck

				Let me re-iterate, i don&#039;t understand why the price had to fucking TRIPLE right before i was about to buy a seller account. I already know how to ship and have read the guides etc.<br /><br />I was only going to start with grams and half grams, then move up to quads. I wasn&#039;t expecting to make fucking $2k a week. Sheesh..<br /><br />Sorry, i just thought running a business would be good seeing i have a great mexican connection.<br /><br />If i can, i would gladly send somebody a sample and if they like it, i would send them more if they could maybe help me get started.<br /><br />I have what it takes.

				Here&#039;s an idea: how about don&#039;t smoke or shoot up any hero for a day; sell it instead. I&#039;m sure you could make more than enough for a vendor account that way.

				some of us buyers put down $500+ just for getting our personal orders situated.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t afford to do this to become a vendor then piss off.&nbsp; After reading all your whining in this thread i would never work with you despite how good your connection or your product may be..... but then, heroin isn&#039;t my thing anyway.

				I find it rather funny that they cant get btc but have no problems converting it back into cash. I would not purchase off of you even if you were selling a product I was interested in. Not every sentence starts out with &quot;Fuck&quot;. Its not that I am not vulgar, because I am. I do try to sensor myself often, maybe you should do the same. But back to the point. You have no clue what you are doing. $500 is nothing. Can you float $500 in product, purchase a vacuum packer, and pay for shipping supplies as well as pay for postage? If you have a sure fire plan maybe you should use that college fund, its not doing you any good sitting there. You will find its much easier to spend your btc on SR. I buy tons of stuff I don&#039;t need. Converting money isnt easy. I move a few thousand out into bank accounts using Mt.Gox and the rest gets spent. I buy a lot of weed, even when I sell it just to break even on the streets its cash in hand. If you do everything right and are &quot;smart&quot; or maybe its not smart but &quot;mature&quot; enough to run a real business you will make more money than a college or high school student &quot;that was never determined&quot; could ever fathom. Anybody who is somebody on here makes enough profit to cover all there losses and business expenses at any given time and can afford to pay all there obligations: mortgage, bills etc... These people aren&#039;t being mean assholes they are all giving sound advice. A reality check if you will. Anyways good luck. If you happen to make it don&#039;t use the same username as you are using on the forum and change your attitude a bit. Most people are here to help and they will if you voice yourself correctly.

Tough love from the above might be enough for you to reassess. I tried to say this in my post but not as effective as this. Treat it as a business. If it&#039;s going to be a struggle for you OTOH, you could just buy for a few months, observe how things are done, see good practice, see bad practice. Coming back in a few months might be enough time to sort money problems and priorities out. Don&#039;t rush it.
