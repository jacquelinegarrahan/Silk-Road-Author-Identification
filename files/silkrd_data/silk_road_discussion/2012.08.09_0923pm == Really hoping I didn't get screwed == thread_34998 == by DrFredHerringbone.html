				did a MP for BTC exchange with seller: &quot;lost&quot; ....said it would take NO MORE than 8 hours for the coin to reach my SR account.....It&#039;s now been 24 hours, still no coin and of course he&#039;s not responding to any of my messages and of course communication had been top notch up until now. ..<br /><br />2 Questions: - How worried should I really be and Is there anything I can do?<br /><br />&nbsp;:(

				I&#039;d say if he has good ratings and there is some good feedback for him here on the boards, I wouldn&#039;t worry at all. If he doesn&#039;t have those two things I feel like you were kinda offering up your money for the taking.

				Look around in the Rumor Mill to see if others have had the same problem as you. He might just be busy, but he also might have scammed you. Always do thorough research on vendors and check their reviews.

				Sorry if it doesn&#039;t work out. Why did you choose to go the MP route anyway?<br /><br />I&#039;m not criticizing, I am asking to understand.<br /><br />I have only deposited via bitinstant myself and it worked very well for me.
