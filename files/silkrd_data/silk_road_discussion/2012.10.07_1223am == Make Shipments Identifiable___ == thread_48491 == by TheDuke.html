				Ok I am out of town and having some stuff sent to a close friend. So far she has received 6 shipments but other than the Viagra I don&#039;t have a clue who they are from and what they are. All of the items I ordered are roughly a gram and can look similar. Basically she has 5 1g bags and all of them are more or less white powders. She was able to spot the coke/xtc pretty quick but things like many of the research chemicals neither me or her are familiar with. Also it could be very dangerous not knowing whats what. For example I received a bag of china white and she tasted it thinking it was coke and told me that I got cheated. I told her not to do a line of anything until we knew exactly what everything was but if she didn&#039;t know better she could of ended up like Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction. Anyways I think vendors should be required or expected to code or label them somehow so we all know what it is when it arrives.

				Totally agree!!!! i usually space out any of my orders to try to prevent this, but this has happened to me before as well and its a bitch. Its not like it hurts to take a fine-point sharpie to the vac or baggie with short abbreviation for your clients.

				God damn. You guys are some drug addicts. I fully support this ;-)<br /><br />The most I&#039;ve ever had in transit at once is 2, and that made me feel as if I was too high on the radar.<br /><br />What if you were to order your coke to &quot;John Q. Public&quot;, your meth to &quot;Jon Q. Public&quot;, and your K to &quot;J. Public&quot;? Having vendors label their stuff isn&#039;t going to fly.

				That is a great idea. I still think some sort of code or labeling of some sort should be required or expected. Think about it. In most cases if someone opens it to the point that they see a bag of white powder the cat is already out of the bag as far as I&#039;m concerned.

				Hi guys, <br /><br />I&#039;ve mentioned this before but this is how you do this, as a buyer. <br /><br />Simply record you order summary somewhere (encrypted) with your own code based on the addressing. <br /><br />eg<br /><br />Bob Smith&nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp; &nbsp;Coke<br />Bob J Smith&nbsp; &nbsp;= Coke order 2 <br />B. Smith = Speed <br />B. J. Smith = 2C-B<br />BJ Smith = Speed order 2 <br /><br />etc etc <br /><br />That way, when you get it you&#039;ll know which vendor / order / white powder it is by the address. I&#039;m sure you can be creative enough to think of loads of combinations. Switching the postcode with state, adding a comma or not.. etc etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most (good) vendors will copy-paste your address for printing. <br /><br />Hope this helps you fiends! <br />

You would be AMAZED how many buyers do not know even the basics of how to format an address. <br /><br />Delivery addresses need to be corrected by vendors all the time.
