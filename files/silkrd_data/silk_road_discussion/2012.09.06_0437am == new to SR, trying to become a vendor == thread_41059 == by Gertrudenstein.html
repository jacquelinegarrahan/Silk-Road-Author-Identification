				Hey there everyone! I&#039;ve known about SR for a while, but I just recently got an account and started seriously learning about bitcoins and PGP encryption. I got interested in it because I&#039;ve been wanting to try iboga for a really long time and have had no luck finding it where I live. I used to be addicted to heroin and my friends and I have had an idea about starting an underground clinic for a while. Anyway, in looking around at different things available and the prices we realized that between all of our prescriptions, most of which we just sell to our friends anyway, we could sell them here instead and get more than enough bitcoins to finance our &quot;clinic.&quot; I know there has to be a post somewhere explaining how to go about becoming a vendor, but I haven&#039;t been able to find it, if someone could point me in the direction of that information it would be greatly appreciated. We have adderall, percocet, klonipin, and xanax, we also make glass pipes so we might sell those too. We&#039;ve talked about the best route to go as far as building a customer base and credibility goes, we&#039;re thinking&nbsp; maybe give like 10-15 free samples of like 2 or 3 pills, or maybe offer them at an extremely steep discount at first. These are our personal prescriptions so we don&#039;t have unlimited amounts and we won&#039;t have everything all at the same time, but I think maybe that will be good, we can offer them cheaper and sell out quickly enough that we won&#039;t cut into anyone elses business or affect the overall market value of the products. Anyway, any advice people can give us on how to get started would be great, or even just links to helpful posts, no need to re-write something that&#039;s been said a thousand times. I hope this works out. I could see this expanding quickly if things go well, I myself only get a small amount every month but many people have expressed interest in selling their prescriptions through me if this ends up being successful.

				so are you saying that you&#039;re advertising to ur friends and people in ur area that ur gonna sell on SR and that they can use you to sell their shit? HORRIBLE IDEA DON&#039;T DO IT trust me dude you had a good idea and ruined it by telling people... if i was going to vend on SR i certainly wouldn&#039;t involve anyone else and i DEFINATELY wouldn&#039;t be sellin on the street. literally doubles your risk. u go from a simple felony distribution of a controlled substance on the street and then they come raid ur shit and find all the SR shit and voila you just earned urself a federal drug trafficking charge so yeah not tryna put u down but u should change alotta shit up before u start sellin on here. not speaking from experience, i just feel like this would be the safest way to go. take my advice however you want it.

				trainfour20 - thanks for that dude! I&#039;d been looking for that forever. We should be up and running in a few days probably, might just have adderall to start though, the scrips all get filled at different times of the month. I&#039;ll post again when we&#039;re set up to let you know. Still have a bit to learn about PGP but I&#039;m figuring it out. Gotta wait til this weekend anyway to have the money to buy a vendor account. <br /><br />m1ndb3der2501 - no, you misunderstood me, I do not sell anything on &quot;the street,&quot; I have like three close friends with whom I&#039;ve done business for years who said they would be interested in selling me their whole scrip every month if I was able to get rid of it on here. But none of us do our business on the street, it&#039;s just a small network of personal friends, most of whom are former classmates or co-workers of ours that we currently unload the scrips on, but that&#039;s just time consuming and not as profitable as this could be. I like the anonymity of this but the assumptions people make when they have no information about you can be pretty funny. I got this hilarious image of myself being on a dark street corner being like &quot;pssst....got them addies&quot; at people walking by. I&#039;m a college educated white woman, not to say I&#039;ve never done anything shady or crazy, but I know how to be plenty discreet when the situation calls for it, selling to strangers on the street is something I&#039;ve never even considered, never had to. <br />

				You really did not look too hard if you did not find the post titled &quot;So you want to be an SR vendor, Here is some of what you need to know&quot; It was on the second page.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39346.0

				sorry i meant hey WOMAN in my first post, not man :) ... also no problem ;) .. like ^ said, that thread in the forums would also be a great place to learn the ins and outs! and the link i offered is more of a starting point when you&#039;re actually ready to start the vendor page.&nbsp; You should find everything you need to know now easily! glad to be of some assistance :D

				jameslink2 - thank you so much, that&#039;s exactly what I was looking for. I think I began looking shortly before that thread was started which is why I missed it, that was the first section of the forum I skimmed through so I was probably looking elsewhere by the time you started the thread. Anyway, thanks, looks like that&#039;ll be really helpful.<br /><br />I had an idea for a shipping method, I feel like I&#039;ve seen similar things done before so it&#039;s not the most original but I was thinking about shipping the pills sealed between pages in paperback books. I know a lot of thrift stores where I could get old trashy romance novels or whatever for like 10 to 25 cents a piece. I could put the pills in a little bag and just seal it between a few pages. I figure this will give the appearance of the operation being an online bookstore, I could print up fake return labels saying something to that effect. I feel like the least risky way to do it from a legal stand point would be to just mail it as if it were correspondence, just in an envelope with a stamp, since we&#039;re only selling small amounts and drug dogs aren&#039;t trained to recognize it. It would be super cheap as well, but I&#039;d have no way to track anything which will inevitably lead to people trying to scam me. I know I would obviously need to switch up where I drop off the packages instead of having a regular spot because that would make it too easy for someone to track me down, but I also wonder as far as tracking goes, is it dangerous to check on the packages? I mean if someone caught on to it, would they be able to trace it back to me by looking at the ip addresses of whoever has been tracking he packages? Can they do that? Or is that just a silly paranoia thing? Would using only the tor browser to check on the packages make it safer?

				I would recommend that you spend a few months as a buyer before attempting to vend.&nbsp; This will give you time to see how stuff works around here: shipping techniques, proper etiquette, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to end up getting yourself in over your head as many vendors have.&nbsp; You may think you have it all figured out but the best way to learn is from the masters and the best way to do that is to spend some time as a buyer yourself.&nbsp; You will realize what you want out of a vendor and can do your best to be that super professional guy.<br /><br />As the saying goes...just my .02 BTC
