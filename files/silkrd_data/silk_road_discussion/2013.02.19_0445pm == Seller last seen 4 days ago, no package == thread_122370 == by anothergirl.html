				I ordered well in advance with express/tracked shipping supposedly taking 3 days so my package would arrive while I was in the US, and now I arrive in town and count up my bounty of packages and it&#039;s not here. It&#039;s 5 days until autofinalize and all the seller&#039;s product listings are gone and he hasn&#039;t been seen for 4 days per the user page. I&#039;ll only be at this address about 3 more days...<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had something not arrive, and this is not a small purchase which is why I made sure to opt for the tracking, but what would be the best course of action here? I don&#039;t really want my BTC back very badly because I only feel safe getting stuff while I&#039;m here in the US and I like my refund rate being 0...<br /><br />FWIW the user is Oz and he&#039;s got 100% feedback and had good communication until now. He left a blurb on his page (obviously at least 4 days ago) that he&#039;s had trouble logging in but he also removed almost all of his user and shipping info and said that he&#039;s respond to all inquiries within 12 hours.<br /><br />Some of the user feedback says he&#039;s been communicating with them even with SR down, but there&#039;s no alternate contact info on his page (maybe there was before most of it was deleted).

				Nope. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/476c4dfc06/<br /><br />Just looks like the user text was hastily deleted 4 days ago...

				Hmm yeah his page does seem pretty sketchy.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what to tell you but based off his recent feedback, his shipping times seem to be 3+ days. I saw somebody said 8 days to east coast<br />Hope you get your package

				Cancel the order and resolve!<br /><br />Do not take any chance!<br /><br />If he is legit you can order again.<br /><br />You will lose your money once it&#039;s auto finalized!<br /><br />Better save then sorry!<br /><br />Get your money back now!

				Huh. Yes strange. I&#039;ve had something similar to this happen to me. I ordered something but then saw the vendor was not logging on! After days of never receiving and I believe I even messaged them, I waited until the &quot;cancel/resolve&quot; button showed. Did that and got my coins right back.<br />Ok now, did you order this package when he was already away?<br />Or did you order it before? If so hopefully you&#039;ll be getting it soon.<br />If I were you I&#039;d wait another day then cancel and get your coins back.

				I don&#039;t think I can cancel after it&#039;s marked in transit...<br /><br />Do I get a refund by default if the guy doesn&#039;t respond?<br /><br />7 days without login... I hope he&#039;s okay anyway. Maybe he got some of that weird luck the other day where people&#039;s bitcoins suddenly increased by ridiculous amounts and retired :)

I was one of the ones to receive the excess bitcoin flow the other week. I had made a purchase a few minutes after the stuff started happening. I had planned on spending 90 but spent 150, and my guy marked it in transit. SR has sinced rolled back the errors, but any package in transit that might of got sent out there could be a prob. When everything was rolled back i had -$66.xx and owe SR now. So who knows he could of gotten some excess coins in that way. My vendor ended up getting all $150 while I sit with a negative balance that I think is being charged interest every so often (small amt)

				I was never tempted because I never got any extra bitcoins.<br /><br />Maybe this is God&#039;s way of preventing me from going through with smuggling my shroom powder back home and ending up in a hellhole for a decade, except I&#039;m an atheist heh
