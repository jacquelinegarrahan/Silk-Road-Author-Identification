				Hi, I&#039;m a new seller and I&#039;m trying to hit those magic numbers so I&nbsp; can request finalization ahead of time.&nbsp; I&#039;m offering a good product at a very competative price.&nbsp; I&#039;m allowing these offers only to established buyers and I understand I&#039;m not allowed to ask for finalization until my probation period is over.&nbsp; I feel that some new buyers may want to make purchases but I just don&#039;t feel comfortable selling to them.&nbsp; So, my solution and question.<br /><br />Since I&#039;m not allowed to ask for finalization, can I make it a requirement for new buyers?&nbsp; If you wan&#039;t to buy from me, and fail to meet my requirements then you may finalize early to be considered.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this breaks the rules but it may be a little gray.<br /><br />Do I get a green light on this?

				Just say all new buyers have to have at least recorded delivery. Having that makes sure people know you are definitely going to send it and you will have solid proof for any new buyer that tries to strip you down. <br /><br />

				Ive seen a couple posts about buyers not being able to finalize for 3 days anyways when it comes to new sellers? IDK. <br /><br />Any advice from Limetless is generally very good.

				Instead of asking for early finalization, why not put in your product info that anyone with &lt; however many previous orders you feel comfortable with must agree to a 0% refund if the item doesn&#039;t arrive?

				Why? It proves that the product has been shipped so there can be no doubt. It allows you not to be ripped off.

But a complaint from a reputable member would eventually put the seller out of business so it&#039;s best not to even try. <br /><br />I&#039;m a new seller too, I&#039;m using tracking for all packages and selling to everyone. even newbies. Makes it safer for me and the seller a bit more confident. At least that way nobody can claim that it never arrived. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21664.msg222389#msg222389">Quote from: Trippyskies on May 04, 2012, 06:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">by recorded delivery, do you mean requiring a signature?<br /><br />thats just creepy to me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The way Canada Post does it is they just scan it as delivered in the system when they drop it off in the mail box. You only need to sign for it if the package is too large and you miss the delivery.

				As long as you DCN (delivery confirmation) and it is confirmed delivered, people will have a hard time saying they never got it and SR should side with you on any disputes, especially if they are new buyers.
