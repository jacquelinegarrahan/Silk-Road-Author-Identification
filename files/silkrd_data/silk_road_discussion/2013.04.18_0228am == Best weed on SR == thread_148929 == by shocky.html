				I doubt you&#039;ll be able to get a clear consensus here - the best weed I ever had from SR was from WeedBros. No idea if they continue to be active, just my experience. Most recently, XXXotica was very good.

				The best vendor on SR for medical cannabis is in stealth mode and not in the general cannabis listings.&nbsp; He has just been taking care of his existing customers with ,by far, the highest quality medicine on the Road.&nbsp; If you are lucky enough to know JackBlue then I don&#039;t have to explain or convince you of this statement.&nbsp; It is the Rothschild of weed.&nbsp; <br /><br />*I am an actual customer and was not compensated for this endorsement.*&nbsp; &nbsp;

				There was an Australian weed vendor a while ago who claimed to have the best hash in the world. When it as first listed it was $68 / gram.<br />And his weed was $207 for a quarter ounce. Even the highest quality weed is not worth this.

				I&#039;ve gone through many of the US vendors and they are all top notch but have different strains at different times.&nbsp; Which means you may want get one that has a potent strain your looking for.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you prefer a head high or a cough lock body type high?&nbsp; Do you want to just have a head buzz or do you want pain relief?&nbsp; &nbsp;Sativa&#039;s will give you the former, indica&#039;s the ladder.&nbsp; &nbsp;And then there are blends, which are much more common.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like an indica dominant strain and I like it potent too.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But I try not to smoke pot, I rather get hash from SR.&nbsp; See even good pot&#039;s potency is kind of unpredictable, even if you have a nice frosy plant, every nug on there isn&#039;t going to be full of wonderful thc filled trichs.&nbsp; And even if you get a wonderful nug to smoke, you still got all the plant matter to burn through.&nbsp; Which is why I go hash, much easier to ship in large amounts and I can smoke a couple of hits of hash and get as baked as 2 or 3 bowls.&nbsp;

Even for top quality, amazing weed that is overpriced. vendors will charge what people will pay, but personally I think $75 is the absolute maximum price for 1/8th oz. As a vendor, I understand processing and sending orders on Silk Road takes a lot more time than selling outside of Silk Road (on the street), as well as Silk Road fees and bitcoin exchange fees. I think it is fair that prices on Silk Road are a bit higher than on the street because of this, and also because of the convenience. There is little risk ordering domestically and it arrives to your house.

				Silly rabbits.Nevertone knows the best weed comes from Canada.&nbsp; It&#039;s our biggest export. . . (And don&#039;t say , ya next to bullshit. )&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a matter of pride that goes into the growing.&nbsp; It&#039;s either a for profit factory or a small grow with guys who care the hell out of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s like a small craft beer versus a large beer company.&nbsp; Most people go with the big guys and say its the best, whe never even trying the other ones.&nbsp; They have no idea.&nbsp; You really got to try them all.<br /><br />A Silk Road cannabis cup anyone?<br />
