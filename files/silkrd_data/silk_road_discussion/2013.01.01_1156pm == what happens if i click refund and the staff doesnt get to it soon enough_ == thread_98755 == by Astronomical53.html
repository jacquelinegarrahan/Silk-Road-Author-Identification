				i have an order thats been in escrow for over a month and in transit since the first day i placed the order... ive extended a couple of times but still have received no tracking number or anything... the seller is telling me if i want it to move faster i need to f.e which im am not comfy with because its not just a few pennies. what should i do? i could click refund but what happens if the staff doesnt get to it soon enough? will it auto finalize on its own?

				who was the seller if you dont mind me asking?<br />and im pretty sure that if you stayed in escrow, you will for sure either get your product or a refund.

				drgonzo and from what me and my buddy understand he has a good rep but that only goes so far on a first encounter. im just worried that if i click refund the auto finalize time is still counting down. our order hasnt even shipped yet.. hes backed up which is understandable but i would like to back out. we could do business in the future once he gets things all sorted out but as of right now i would like a refund

				Firstly definitely don&#039;t FE, especially for the reason of &#039;speeding things up&#039;, that sounds like a blag.<br /><br />Did you say it&#039;s marked &#039;in transit&#039;? I didn&#039;t think you could click refund once it&#039;s marked &#039;in transit&#039;.<br /><br />How desperate are you to get this item? Are there any alternatives? It&#039;s been a really long time if he hasn&#039;t shipped it yet, I&#039;d refund it and use another vendor if that&#039;s an option.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				damn, every single one of that guys listings are for copious amounts of drugs xD. but im almost positive hes legit. i cant recall ever hearing anything bad about him.<br />if you refund it wont autofinalize i dont think(which would definitely be terrible with any one of his listings)<br />if he for sure didnt send it i would just contact him and tell him you wish to back out. if he doesnt comply, you could always leave the appropriate rating and thats enough to convince a lot of vendors to make it right in some way..<br /><br />if you continue to have trouble with him post about it. inform the rest of us on what we might be getting into if we buy from him.<br />(although like i said, im almost positive hes legit)<br /><br />

				yeah i understand your frustration but now that i think about it, refunds look like shit in your buyer stats and it will freak your next potential vendor out.. if i had to make a choice i would just wait for the order because youll be wanting to make more purchases/be trusted by the community in the long run. <br /><br />shitty situation to be in friend, hope it all works out for you.

				After 4 days, you can cancel the order without it affecting your stats. (as long as the order isn&#039;t marked in transit)<br /><br />~Flush

				Just back out and purchase off someone else. Plenty of other vendors wont make it such a hassle and would be more than happy to serve you.
