				might be a noob question, but I can&#039;t find a place where i can put my pgp public key on my profile.<br />It&#039;s kind of annoying to attach your public key to every message you send out.<br /><br />EDIT : i am well aware that the seller accounts have it under settings. but what about buyer accounts ?

				I also noticed that buyers cannot edit their profiles... I don&#039;t understand why SR has eliminated this feature from buyer accounts?

				No its never been made available to the buyers profile, however it has been suggested as a feature request.&nbsp; In the mean time you can post your key in this thread and link to your message.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.0<br /><br />
