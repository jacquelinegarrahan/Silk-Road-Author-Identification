				I&#039;m seeing more and more vendors that are no longer willing to accept resolution unless buyers come up with a customs letter to prove that it was taken. This<br />is completely unreasonable. Many countries including Australia do mot issue them. And what about if the customs letter was in Russian, for example. Also, are we to compromise our safety by actually sending them this letter? There are too many vendors doing this. Here is an example<br />&nbsp;Streetpharmacy: &quot;15.08.2010<br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br />ATTENTION: There will be no more reships or refund without a letter from customs, proving<br />the seizure! I have enough of those leeches looking for free drugs.<br /><br />This was SRs response:The Resolution Staff freely ignores vendor policy when it&#039;s not reasonable.&nbsp; &nbsp;~SR Support<br /><br />DON&#039;T be intimidated by unreasonable vendors!

				You have to take into account the vendor&#039;s perspective as reship requests can run rampant. Replacement material will cause overall product pricing to increase resulting in fewer purchases. <br /><br />The escrow system in place is far above any reasonable protection one would receive elsewhere. CDN should be available to the point of failure and any resulting love letter should be forwarded upon request. The letter could be redacted if necessary and shared from an anonymous file store online.<br /><br />CAVEAT EMPTOR.

				The problem for vendors is that if their stuff is suddenly being seized at customs, then they have to go through a lot of work to prevent this happening in future, triple checking stealth-packing, changing all the external elements, maybe using a different post office to ship from too. It&#039;s real easy for a buyer to say that something was stopped at customs no matter if it was stopped there, before it left home, or was scooped up ten feet away from the buyers door, or indeed actually arrived. <br /><br />Obviously countries without love-letters, thats a problem and you should probably talk to the seller before ordering in that case. But that said if your local police are reading your mail and stealing your drugs then that&#039;s the buyers problem. <br /><br />We all have to find a way to work with each other that has mutual benefit and little risk. That is difficult. It may take a lot of work to find vendors to buy from that offer the terms you want, and will probably cost you more. Its difficult.

				Both of your responses are way too sympathetic to sellers, which makes me suspicious that you are both sellers, incognito.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the point IS that requesting proof of seizure, at the most FUNDAMENTAL leve,l is unworkable and totally unreasonable. It would compromise the buyer by sending to the vendor a scanned customs letter. Totally ridiculous, and if some vendors decide to take this ludicrous option then they should be tapped down by SR. And by the looks of it, they won&#039;t be getting away with it, anyway.

				If there wasn&#039;t so many scammers claiming non delivery then vendors wouldn&#039;t need to impose these conditions. As a uk vendor all i can do is prove i posted the package, tracking isn&#039;t available for most countries so all i can do is get a certificate of posting to prove i posted the order. If a buyer doesn&#039;t have to prove they&#039;ve had the shipment seized then it&#039;s a free ride for the scammers. If vendors cannot prove they posted the package then the resolution centre usually awards 100% refunds, surely the same protection should be given to vendors~?<br /><br />How does scanning a customs letter compromise a buyer?

				I&#039;m certainly not a vendor but can appreciate your assumption. There are widely available methods for providing a vendor with proof of material seizure such as a customs letter while preserving anonymity. It would be the choice of the vendor to select an amicable vehicle for providing this proof. The response I want to convey most is that it is reasonable that a vendor require any available proof if it is available. <br /><br />

				I guess my point is that demanding a customs letter will not stop an SR resolution from going ahead, in which case the demand will be deemed unreasonable, as well as a compromise in security. Sending a scanned file that can&#039;t be encrypted, anyhow, will potentially compromise the sender and, perhaps, the receiver. It can&#039;t be done, and shouldn&#039;t. If vendors tally up at the end of the day that, along with losses, they aren&#039;t making enough profit then they will naturally drift away. Buyers have to work within the parameters of the vendors, but vendors have to work within the parameters of SR.&nbsp; It seems some vendors are starting to, out of frustration, set the bar too high. It is at this point that SR won&#039;t support the vendor in this respect. It&#039;s unworkable.<br /><br />Also, not every country&#039;s border control sends a customs letter, only some. <br /><br />And then what about a customs letter from a non-speaking country? Please don&#039;t reply that they would use Google Translate. The vendor would have to type in a foreign language - Russian, Greek, Chinese, to get some translation online. Can you imagine the frustration and downtime?&nbsp; <br /><br />SR refunding appears not to be limited to customs seizure, but is based on the buyer actually receiving the product. Unless that changes, customs seizure is only part of the possible loss scenarios.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think you will find, Plutopete, that demanding a copy of a customs seizure notice, unencryptable and not universally applied, will be deemed to be unreasonable by SR. Let&#039;s wait and see, cos it&#039;s gonna be coming up soon, I&#039;m sure.

				It&#039;s came up many times mate, I myself have scanned such a letter for a vendor, and received a refund afterwards. I agree that this can&#039;t be done for some countries that don&#039;t issue seizure letters, but you are suggesting that SR Support will back any buyer that claims non arrival of a package, don&#039;t you see how ridiculous that is? :)

If you are able to, in every case, show you&#039;ve sent it, then you&#039;re on a winner. <br /><br />The flip-side - and this is the issue here, besides security - is that not every country issues customs letters and definitely not in English, so demanding a customs letter from a buyer in order to issue refunds leaves them at a distinct disadvantage. I haven&#039;t come across a vendor yet who has been able to consistently show proof of postage, because most use ordinary mail.

				This is one of the scary things for new vendors. I sell weed and want to sell some on here soon.<br /><br />Your first few customers kind of seem to have the power to make or break you? I only plan to send to the UK and Ireland since i have done it for a while for family and friends off SR. I never lost any small letterbox sized package I sent first class in many years. I know for sure it works or i wouldnt do it.<br /><br />But if one of my first customers i sent some weed to had say 10 transactions and gives me a 1/5 saying they dont get it what can a new vendor do apart from resend it?<br /><br />Cant you just use vendors who have a refund policy that you like? I guess also appreciate that you are buying illegal stuff so you should assume some of the risk. I think ppl who give 50% refunds for non arrivals with no proof are very generous indeed. <br />

				Buyers, the bottom line is this:<br /><br />If you don&#039;t feel comfortable ordering and smuggling through customs then don&#039;t! The good vendors will get you packages through customs 99% of the time. If the vendor is good at what he does and studies CUSTOMS&#039; policies of the destined country it will go through! If it doesn&#039;t it is because a very rare fluke or your address is being watched.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t the vendor&#039;s fault and this is why we carry DCN#s to make sure that we aren&#039;t getting fucked out of our good will. So, a customs letter is necessary to provide the vendor and SR staff to resolve the matter. If you don&#039;t have proof and the vendor does that he shipped then you&#039;re going to still pay. This is for trusted vendors and there will always be assholes that will deviate from the standard.<br /><br />Most of the time vendors will be more than willing to reship in order to maintain his rating and to make sure YOU ARE HAPPY. Just don&#039;t go on the boards cussing him/her up and down without using some logic before hand.<br /><br />I have no sympathy for people like that^^^^^^ and you will be blacklisted from ever buying from me until I receive a formal apology and you prove that you can buy products off SR like an adult.<br /><br />-SJ

				I dont see how scanning the customs letter exposes you to any danger.<br /><br />The seller and you both know what was in the pack that was seized and he already knows the address you gave him to ship LOL.

				There&#039;s no fiasco. The issue is that some vendors, in their frustration, are going too far in demanding things that are going beyond the pale. No vendor can serious expect to win a case in Resolution where they refuse to issue a refund based on a buyer being unable to supply a customs letter. It&#039;s gone too far. Vendors refusing to sell unless buyers FE is too far. It needs to be based on a buyer&#039;s reputation. In that case, the vendors refuses to sell and keeps within SR guidelines. <br /><br />Just as stupid are buyers who, for some unknown reason, simply FE without even being asked to do and then have no recourse if a delivery fails.&nbsp; In those two categories, buyers and vendors are working outside of SR guidelines, and things are therefore bound to unravel.&nbsp; If buyers want to be stupid, then it&#039;s their choice, but we can&#039;t allow vendors to start dictating terms as though they can do whatever they want. They can&#039;t. That&#039;s the point, and some vendors just don&#039;t seem to get it. Hence the &#039;customs letter&#039; issue we have now.<br /><br />&nbsp;

No customs declaration, No indication it was anything other than a letter to the person and the item was not something that should have been flagged or confiscated. In two of the 3, the item was not even illegal in the country it was going to.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Just to quote you there Flyboy, &quot;I may be wrong here but I believe that if the package was shipped and proof of shipment is provided by the vendor then SR rules in the vendors favor. Again, I may be wrong but even providing a 50/50 on a lost, stolen, or confiscated package is up to the vendor.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; response: if you have proof that you sent it, why would you want a customs letter from a buyer who probably didn&#039;t receive one, anyway?&nbsp; If you have your proof. Be happy. I&#039;m sure SR will smile down on you.&nbsp; <br /><br />second quote &quot;However, you can not do a DCN on most international orders so I have to trust that the buyer will be honest.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; response: Exactly, I think you are finally getting the point. Merchants usually have no proof they sent it; buyers usually have no proof that it was confiscated. |So asking for a customs letter is about as dumb as a buyer asking for proof from a vendor that it was sent.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Now, that we have cleared that up, I suggest you stop dipping into your own lolly bag for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

Unfortunately this world is full of low-life losers who can&#039;t be honest in their business transactions.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lost a little money here and there dealing with online vendors, but in all I&#039;ve had pretty good luck.

We have a couple of idiot vendors here that are trying to dominate this discussion, fuck &#039;em.<br /><br />&nbsp;Your point is fair. If the vendor has proof of it being sent, then it probably goes in their favour in resolution, by what percentage, who knows.&nbsp; But requesting a proof of confiscation is not going to work because not every country issues them, and not in English, so you have language issues as well.&nbsp; A vendor can in theory 100% of the time get proof of postage if they decide to track or whatever. But a buyer will not always receive a certificate. A vendor demanding a certificate from someone in Hungary does not know if that country issues certificates. How can they demand something that is not issued? Secondly, they probably wouldn&#039;t be able to read it anyway.&nbsp; So it&#039;s unworkable.&nbsp; <br /><br />I challenge any vendor to go down that line and see how far they get in resolution. You won&#039;t win under that premise. Showing proof of postage would be the only option, and many would not be able to do that, anyhow. So, would a certificate be enough to totally lose a refund for a buyer? One would find out in resolution. <br /><br /><br />It must not be allowed for vendors to simply issue refunds based on customs certificates. <br /><br />

				As a buyer I&#039;d be quite willing to buy from a vendor who didn&#039;t offer any refund providing he took as much precautions as possible to get it through and could show a good track record.I know I&#039;m buying something illegal therefore if it gets seized I don&#039;t see what right I have to complain. It&#039;s not like you&#039;ve been ripped off by a street dealer selling you baby laxative or aspirin. Anyone whose packaiging was below par would soon be out of business as no one would go back to him. If I buy electronic goods and they get seized and I have to pay tax on them I wouldn&#039;t expect the shop shipping the goods to pay it, they fulfilled their end of the bargain, I knew the risk, I took the chance, I pay the penalty..<br /><br />Of course, all goes without saying packaging has to be as stealthy as possible and and a refund system does make a vendor think long and hard about best way to package so some incentive is helpful.<br /><br />Maybe another way to do it would be to give 50% value of the seizure off the next order from that vendor then both parties lose a little for what is a risk both are taking. The vendor makes takes a loss on what he is selling and the buyer loses half the value of what was seized.
