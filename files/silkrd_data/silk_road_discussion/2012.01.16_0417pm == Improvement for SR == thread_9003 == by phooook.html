				Hey guys,<br /><br />I just thought of a nice improvement concerning the order status of a delivery.<br /><br />Many sellers change the status to &quot;in transit&quot; very fast (within hours) because that way the finalize options pops up.<br />But I&#039;d really like to know when they shipped it cause that way I can get a much better estimate on how long I have to wait/know when to worry.<br /><br />My first transaction last year was shipped within Germany. About 90% off all letters send inside of Germany reach their destination within 2 days. Sp if you don&#039;t get your mail after 2 days something is strange and after 3 days you can start worrying.<br /><br />It took 4 days back then and arrived fine, but it made me worry and that could have been avoided.<br />I can understand every seller that changes the status to &quot;in transit&quot; ASAP cause then we can pay the faster.<br /><br />So, what I propose is: add a &quot;order is processing&quot; status that enables the &quot;finalize&quot; button too.<br />That way I know that the seller has the goods and is going to ship them, so I can pay now if trusted. And when he&#039;s heading for the post office the next day and tossing my letter, he can change it to &quot;in transit&quot; so I know it&#039;s on its way now :)<br /><br />What do you think?

				I was thinking of showing an &quot;Accepted&quot; flag to let the buyer know the order has been acknowledged and will proceed... even if the &quot;finalize&quot; is not available!

				The seller doesn&#039;t want to ship it until after it&#039;s been marked in transit because otherwise the buyer could cancel it before it was sent. But I would appreciate it if sellers at least didn&#039;t mark it as in transit until the day they&#039;re planning on sending it out. =P

				Another aspect of status that would be very helpful is to simply change the &quot;order&quot; link on the top of the page in some way to indicated any order status change, so we quickly know a change has occurred. <br />-S-
