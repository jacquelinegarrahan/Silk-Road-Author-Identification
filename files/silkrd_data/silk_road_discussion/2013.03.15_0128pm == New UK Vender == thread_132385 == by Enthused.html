				Hi everyone!<br /><br />We are EnthusedUK (we being Moo, D and Drew), a new UK vendor selling only High grade Marijuana and maybe a few other bits and pieces we can get our hands on ^_^<br /><br />We’re prior SR buyers so we know how it all works and love it!<br /><br />We like to think of ourselves as connoisseurs, as all three of us are long term pot lovers, so you’ll never get a bad smoke :)&nbsp; If we don’t like it, we won’t sell it.<br /><br />We’ll be starting up between 15-17th March. :) We’ll only be selling to the UK for the time being :) see how it goes then maybe Europe. <br /><br />We aim for next day delivery if orders are placed before 1pm :)<br /><br />Unfortunately we have no free samples as yet due to just starting up but we’re hoping to have them in the near future.<br /><br />If you’re interested we hope to see an order from you soon! It will most likely be me (moo) who replies to forums and D who will deal with your requests/purchases :)<br /><br />Thanks, The Enthused Trio ^_^<br /><br />P.S- It should be starting today, As soon as we&#039;re up I will post a link for our vender page :)

				I&#039;m certainly interested if you&#039;re selling by the OZ. We need more bulk vendor here in the UK. What sort of weights are you shifting and what sort of prices are we looking at? If the price is right I&#039;m willing to give you guys a go! Peace

				Hey EnthusedUK, looking forward to seeing your bud when you have it listed! Always good to see a new vendor on The Road :)<br /><br />Any clues as to what strains will be up first, and what other treats (edibles, etc.) will be available? :)<br /><br />Thanks mate.

				Brilliant it&#039;s always good to see a new UK vendor! <br /><br />Same questions as others: what sort of weights will you be selling and at what prices? Which strains will you have in?<br /><br />Cheers mate
