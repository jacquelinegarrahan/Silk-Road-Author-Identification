				Saw this site being advertised on the bitcoin forums and was wondering if anyone knew anything about it.<br /><br />I get probably 2 messages a day from new people asking/complaining about getting bitcoins, so it&#039;d be really nice to be able to send them to a site like this that promises 24hour turn around (they accept Western Union and Prepaid Credit Cards amongst others) instead of trying to explain bank --&gt; dwolla --&gt; exchange.<br /><br />&nbsp;I feel like i&#039;m breaking their poor chemical-dependent hearts when I tell them it&#039;ll take at least 5 days before they can even begin to participate in the shangri-la that is Silk Road

Of course, I&#039;m one of those noobs who I bet have come in droves since the WIRED article. Please, have mercy on us. We mean well; it&#039;s just that we&#039;re stupid...at least for right now. But we have all this lovely money that we&#039;d be happy to give to nice, honest folks who have things they&#039;d like to sell us. <br /><br />The main problem about getting started is that all the pages, SR included, say how easy it is to get BCs. And it is...if you&#039;ve gotten some before. And in the case of major purchases, if you&#039;ve gotten a LOT of them before. We find out things are little bit more complicated than we thought. Like MtGox really should be named MtGox/Dwolla. And those services that don&#039;t require bank transfers need to &quot;verify&quot; your honesty. And if you&#039;ve never done any online bartering or even any eBay purchases it&#039;s kinda hard to verify yourself. I&#039;m Catch-22&#039;d out. I&#039;m almost at the point that if someone gave me a PO box or remailer address I&#039;d send him/her a few hundred dollars, even knowing that&#039;s probably like putting a match to the money. Well, almost. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just telling the world I&#039;m a doofus, but the BC experience has my head spinning at the awkwardness of actually getting the BCs. For someone who&#039;s just starting the SR/BC experience, and they want to make a moderately sizable purchase, say, $500 US, it looks like it might take maybe 2-3 smaller purchases to go through okay before you could reach the level where the BC services would let you purchase enough BCs, or sellers who&#039;d feel comfortable. So maybe it&#039;d take 3-4 weeks before the buyer finally got what and how much he wanted to buy in the first place. And now I read something about some BC services are not processing bank transfers?! What&#039;s a libertarian-minded person in search of off-the-menu medicinal compounds or botanical items to do?&nbsp; Woe is me. <br />&nbsp;<br />But if I&#039;m wrong, please let me know!

				I&#039;m wondering why someone (probably are people/companies like this) Buy a moneypak and then come to an agreement on price, obv higher price than what mt gox is trading. Granted, someone could easily scam. But, aren&#039;t there sellers on craigslist that sell bitcoins? Going thru the whole process is a pain, but almost zero chance of getting scammed.<br /><br />Im new to the bitcoin scene (so far, its been a costly lesson) and just wondering what the alternatives are out there.. It isn&#039;t a crime to buy and sell bitcoins.. I was just wondering if anyone has sold their bitcoins to an individual. Or purchased them, for that matter.

				I used them just the other day - under 3 hours for fulfillment - fast, friendly, and helpful communication. Best of all it&#039;s a flat 5% fee and that&#039;s it. I totally recommend since bitcoinexchange.cc told me it would be a week before they could process a moneypak order due to backup. Will use again!<br /><br />He also has started a review thread on bitcointalk.org - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34812.0 - albeit few reviews, it shows he&#039;s serious about business.

				I&#039;ve not had any problems with get-bitcoin. Used them twice so far (large amounts) and it has always been under 24 hrs. <br />FYI, enter 0 into maximum price otherwise your order might get rejected due to the market (and your price).

				I put in an order and took them longer than 24 hours to process it, and it seemed that B of A was all that was offered when I though Wells Fargo was on the list for bank transfers.<br />I canceled.<br /><br />BTC Buddy had bitcoins in my SR account in 3 minutes from a greendot moneypack after a bit of haggling.<br />The rate ended up being about 14% but if someones heart being broken is at stake it would be worth it.<br />It&#039;s worth it to me on occasions when I don&#039;t plan ahead.<br /><br />When I do plan ahead I&#039;ll use Dwolla and Mt Gox. Dwolla holds my money for every last minute they can (bastards) but Mt Gox goes smooth and fast for me, although I usually drive the price of coins up as I buy and have to keep upping my bid if I want it to go fast.<br /><br />As far as getbitcoin.....if I wanted to wait I&#039;d use the above method......if i wanted uncertainty I&#039;d go moneypack on SR.

				I&#039;m sorry to hear about the problems with get-bitcoin.com ... they&#039;ve been very reliable and quick, for me, never a problem, but I had read they stopped Wells Fargo deposits, so perhaps they are doing what they all do, which is start out great, and go downhill from there...and I still don&#039;t like sending money to people on here, where I&#039;ve no protection at all, but it does seem some of the vendors on here are o.k.

				I used get-bitcoin last week for the 3rd or 4th time.&nbsp; &nbsp;This time was slower than before but in fairness it was within the 24 hour timeframe they promise or they refund their fee.&nbsp; &nbsp;I made the deposit in the AM and sent the email and reciept soon after.&nbsp; In the past I have had my coins that afternoon.&nbsp; This time They were there the following morning.&nbsp; They did respond to my email asking for the status of my order....and stated that it depends on how busy they are with other orders and to be patient and to NOT WORRY.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />It still was a fine transaction imo.....but I would like them to send the coins the same day if you deposit early enough.

Also noticed that they usually wait until bitcoins are at their highest point until purchasing/depositing, which makes sense as they work on a % basis. What I do is set my maximum for my order to about or a little less than what I think the high will be for the day, then email them about it. Usually they process a little quicker.<br /><br />Also from what I can guess, they process 40-60 orders a day (guessing based on my order numbers and time between said orders). Still highly recommend using them, especially depositing cash with BoA or Chase. Seems like a good way to anonymize purchasing of btc.
