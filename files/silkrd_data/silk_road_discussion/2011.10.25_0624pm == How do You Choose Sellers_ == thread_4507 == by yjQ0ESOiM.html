				Hello, I&#039;m new to SR and would like to know what criteria a seller must meet for you specifically, not me, to buy from.<br /><br />This means what kind of ranking, number of reviews, freshness of reviews, etc. must a seller show for you to buy?<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				Just buy from me.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />But seriously, when I first started I went by the seller&#039;s ratings and price then before making a purchase I would do as BD suggests and search for reviews of the seller in the forum. Follow this method and use common sense and you can avoid being scammed.

				Choose sellers who have been around a while with good feedback.&nbsp; Buy small amount first then move up especially with newer vendors.&nbsp; Read forums.&nbsp; Read scam reports. Stay within escrow if you can.

				Good sellers interact a lot here in the forums, they&#039;re active.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re very well known too.<br /><br />

				Choose wisely and still take your chances.<br />At anytime a good vendor can go bad.<br />Don&#039;t trust the vendor reviews on SR, use just as a guide.<br />Guy&#039;s been around 1 day and has 5 good reviews that would be a dead give away.<br /><br />Use the rumor mill forum to check your vendor out.<br />Use the forum search function.<br />Also read my sticky on what to do if the package doesn&#039;t arrive. BEFORE it doesn&#039;t arrive ;)<br /><br />Stay away from Speed, Coke, H, and LSD until you know what you are doing.<br />Don&#039;t go out of escrow and send funds direct unless you really trust your vendor.<br /><br />Besides the BTC value changes will screw you more.<br /><br />Don&#039;t screw your vendor over, he WILL call your anonymous ass out.

				1. Search for the user you&#039;re thinking of buying from on the forums. Read what people have to say about them - this place has saved me from bad decisions a few times already!<br /><br />2. Look at their feedback. Does it all look the same? <br /><br />3. Time on SR - not saying new sellers can&#039;t be legit, but I&#039;d rather pay a proven vendor a bit more to feel secure in my purchase.<br /><br />:)
