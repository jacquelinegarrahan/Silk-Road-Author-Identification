				Newbie question. Is there anyway to delete the feedback you have left for a seller off a buyers account settings? Thanks.

				I&#039;m not sure about deleting, but you can certainly edit the feedback left.<br /><br />Go to Account &gt; View Feedback (on right hand side) &gt; then select the feedback you would like to alter by clicking edit.<br /><br />sdesu

				yes I know that thanks, seems odd though that you can&#039;t delete feedback once you have left feedback? what purpose does it it serve to have it stay on there for weeks, or months at a time other than for self incrimination in case your account is ever accessed. deletion should be looked at as an option, once your final feedback has been left.

Having access to SR allows you to buy more drugs, weapons, ect. than you could ever imagine. Having a strong password is kind of required. :/<br /><br />sdesu<br />

				thanks sdesu just that orders fall off or PM&#039;s can be deleted at will but feedback probably the single most incriminating thing on a buyer account stays. i have been on sr for quite some time now and believe me my password strength is ridiculously high. anyway thanks for listening, just kind of bugs me a bit. not trying to stir things up, just thinking of trying to keep the buyers side safer than it already is. good day.
