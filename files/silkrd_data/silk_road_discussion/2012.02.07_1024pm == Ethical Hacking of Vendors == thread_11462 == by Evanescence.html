				I think it&#039;s a great idea.<br /><br />If I were DPR, I might get a couple of private detectives to find me. That way you are covering your bases with &#039;friendly fire&#039;. Same goes for any high profile vendors.

I guarantee you there are cops or law enforcement just waiting for someone to be as stupid to do this..

It could compromise your security if you did it naively as you pointed out. But there&#039;s lots of other ways you can test parts of your security procedures. i.e. it doesn&#039;t have to be &#039;you&#039;. It could be somebody else who is doing something similar to you. Maybe that sounds obscure, but you know what I mean I think.

				Weird, I was dreaming last night that I was checking my vendor&#039;s physical security and pentesting his rig.&nbsp; Yeah, I agree with this one.

				FWIW, the version of firefox (10.0) in the latest tor browser bundle build is exploitable via this bug:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Olli Pettay found that ReadPrototypeBindings will leave a XBL binding in a hash table even when the function fails. If this occurs, when the cycle collector reads this hash table and attempts to do a virtual method on this binding a crash will occur. This crash may be potentially exploitable.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not sure if this exploit requires scripting that is (supposed to be) blocked via the NoScript add-on, torbutton, custom tweaks made by the tor foundation etc. but there is no way to to automatically update FF to 10.0.1 without doing it manually and possibly messing up the install.<br /><br />This is why everyone should run TBB in a VM or sandbox. For the truly paranoid, you can boot off of read-only media and load the entire OS into RAM. This won&#039;t keep your SR account safe (use strong passwords dammit), but it will minimize the risk of the feds or some l33t h4x0r planting a persistent trojan on your machine. Just make sure you update your boot disc or whatever with the latest patches. If I were a vendor, I would take it one step further and use random wifi APs in different areas. At that point, it&#039;s highly unlikely that you&#039;ll be caught via network. There are much easier, more traditional ways to catch people in this business. Always be on your toes, be aware of your surroundings, and trust NO ONE.
