				Is anyone else experiencing this, I have a vendor i put an order with over the weekend, They haven&#039;t logged on to their account in 5 days and have no listings up and I&#039;m wanting to go with a vendor who is actively selling this product and the cancel button is green and showing available but when i hit it once it just takes me to the order screen without cancelling that order and then when i try it a second time it takes me to my account screen with a red text saying please log out and log back in, when i tried that it doesn&#039;t solve the problem and just repeats the same errors. I put in a ticket to SR support yesterday and still haven&#039;t heard back and see they still haven&#039;t read it. Hope this gets resolved. <br /><br /><br />Thanks, Organon

				I´m having the exact same problem. a vendor I already bought from and made a pretty good experience. I ordered yesterday and only noticed today that he was last logged in 3 days ago, but today all of his listings were inactive. How is it possible to remove the listings that were still available yesterday when I placed my order,but the vendor himself wasn´t seen in 3 days. That was all too strange for me and to my surprise the cancel button was green and available. So I decided to cancel but nothing happened, the order and the money in escrow stayed completely the way they were, just that an error occured and that I should log-in and try again. Did that several times now, Nothing! have a good night everyone....

				I had the same problem. Placed an order on Monday and it was processing since. I tried to cancel Friday but it was doing the same thing described here. I figured I would try it Saturday but to my pleasure the Vendor shipped the order during that time. Sorry I can&#039;t give any more help but I can at least confirm that it&#039;s not just you who was/is having issues with cancel.

				I&#039;m seeing this too on a transaction that&#039;s now past the 4-day cancel mark.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried logging out and back in, but no luck.&nbsp; I guess its trouble ticket time.

				hi organ,<br />would be highly interesting to know if the SR support has any answer to that problem. I put in a ticket myself a few hours ago but since you were the first to adress that topic here it would be interesting to hear if you already got some reply.<br />Have a good one<br />theforgotten<br />
