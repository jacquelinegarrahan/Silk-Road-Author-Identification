				Is SR down or is it just me that is having problems? Probably just super busy, but I just put a lot of money in my SR wallet so I was just curious!

I&#039;ve also seen him advertising he sells bitcoins. Didn&#039;t know that was allowed without a vendor acct.&nbsp; Either way don&#039;t trust this dude. Nomad&#039;s right.<br /><br />Sorry to get off post but SR is working fine for me. Wait, great for me. Fast page flips and first time login. Just keep switching up identities and hopefully your problem will clear up.
