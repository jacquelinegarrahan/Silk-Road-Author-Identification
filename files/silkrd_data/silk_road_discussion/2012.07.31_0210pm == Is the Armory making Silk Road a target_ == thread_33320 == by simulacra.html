				I would disagree with you in that it is incredibly likely that there is an extraordinarily high level of overlap in the groups of people who would have a drug website shut down and groups who would have an arms website shut down.

				The government is already fighting an all out war on drugs, and if they could find a way to take down Silk Road, they would. The fact that a couple of guns, some ammo, or a few hand grenades are also available doesn&#039;t really create any new incentive for them. Realistically, a lot of what is available there can be legally purchased in person, or online, in most states; whereas drugs are banned federally.

Everyone here is a terrorist and enemy of the state in the eyes of law.<br /><br />Silk Road is not a community. It&#039;s an enterprise. And the most of its users is a bunch of laymen who want to chew on their drugs and pretend that they do no harm funding criminal groups, till they are busted and convicted for life. In the mean time they are afraid of the negative media attention and security agencies. I don&#039;t see a problem for politicians to add a death penalty for ordering drugs online and kill those one by one. A few killed goodthinks will deter everyone from using Silk Road, since everyone will be spooked to death. Nobody will ever protest, they will just run back to Gawker, from where they&#039;ve come. As, obviously, killing goodthinks, funding criminals, or walking on the streets with drugs, so they were available to kids, is not a harm at all, the main principle of Silk Road will not fail: &quot;Do no harm to Silk Road, we want to earn money still&quot;.<br /><br />Reporters, feel free to record. I am not afraid of negative attention, security agencies, or angry goodthinks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You sir are a complete ignorant asshole and likely LE.&nbsp; You&#039;re trying to say that me, an otherwise law abiding citizen who pays lots of taxes on my $100K salary that i make by being an IT manager deserves to be KILLED? my children and spouse deserves to loose their legal income providing parent because i like to buy drugs on SR? it is proven that drugs in moderation help people&#039;s stress and mental health. i live a very stressful life juggling long hours at the office and with my kids . i own a beatiful home too ... so i deserve to be killed again? WTF. u make no sense. the DEA and the people who enforce or encourage their barbarian, psychopathic laws deserve to be working at mcdonalds flipping burgers or in jail for putting away harmless people. YES there are some &quot;criminals&quot; involves but thats because drugs are illegal. if they were legalized there wouldnt need to be the criminal aspect.. or atleast it would go away SIGNIFICANTLY.&nbsp; You are uneducated, probably a conservative and probably LE. Think about this. if your grown child or wife was to purchase&nbsp; a couple grams of pot, or a couple percocets to help with mental stress or physical pain that their doctor is too afraid to prescribe, do you think they should be put to death ?? <br /><br />I hope u think long and hard about your stance. we are not harming you, and this place IS a community. the forums are a very friendly, loving community that will do anything prortect the &quot;enterprise&quot; that SR is running. because this &quot;enterprise&quot; has for once empowered us as human being to make our own decisions and do whats best for us and you, nor anyone else has the right to say I cannot put a subsctance in my body or that i deserve to die for putting a subsctance in my body. After all, alcohol is legal and more dangerous then any drug ive tried&nbsp; yet its legal and celebrated despite all the deaths and tragedies that result from it. tobacco is a drug more addicting then heroin yet when you&#039;re 18 u can buy as much as you want. coffee is a stimulant... so is cocaine.. why is coffee legal and not cocaine when pure, clean coke just gives u a nice clean, energetic, euphoric lift? <br /><br />i guess u wouldn&#039;t want someone escaping their own head eh by puffing on a joint eh? misery loves company which is why the miserable people who dont do drugs and advocate against them want everyone to quit. so everyone will be miserable with them. <br /><br />get a grip, become more educated on the topics you speak of and get the hell out of our LOVING COMMUNITY. trolls like u are not welcome you peice of dung.<br /><br />Lim, tag your it. your turn to finish this guy off. what an ignorant, hateful,&nbsp; douche bag. karma will catch up with u one day u jerk.<br /><br /><br />

In the armory forums you just see people making requests with no intent to buy/vendors introducing themselves but not selling/scammers/people making requests for collectible firearms. There are almost no legitimate vendors, and almost no transactions. The media is just using the armory to come up with interesting stories and trying to establish a relationship with it to current events. The armory is a scapegoat for the media.

				I think The Armory is decidedly more nefarious than the Silk Road (which I think is mostly harmless). But for what it&#039;s worth OP mentioned Aurora, and last I read the shooter obtained all his firearms and etc through legal channels. At least in the States weapons are much easier to get a hold of than drugs.

				Any gun owner who visits the armory will agree, there isn&#039;t really anything there. What is available is wildly overpriced. I suppose the premium is for the anonymity and traceless possession of the weapon? But honestly everything I&#039;ve seen is a 100% to 300% mark-up. A silly think to be attacking.

				Both are targets. And you gotta believe there&#039;s some agent out there with a hard-on for taking these places down and getting a promotion. <br /><br />I&#039;d suspect more infiltrations on TA than on SR, however. Authorities create a vendor account, start off supplying innocous items for sale (a couple handguns here, some ammo there), building up trust over time...and then start offering more unique shit that a wannabe terrorist would be interested (I saw a guy offering devices that the ELF use in actions, for example)....ship it, develop report with the individual outside of TA even, and then bust it up. I have followed how the tactics of LE when going after mulim extremists and left-wing radicals....entrapment seems to be the order of the day. They definitely have a playbook. <br /><br />&quot;So, you want to fuck shit up? Yeah me too. I mean, if I were to do it, I&#039;d blow up that bridge during the NATO summit. In fact, I know a guy that has some explosives...but he wants way more money than I can afford...and I dont know, I&#039;m kinda scared to do that kinda stuff. But if you ever want to do an action, maybe he can hook you up.&quot;<br /><br />Dumb anarchist 22 year old agrees to buy explosives with a little peer pressure. He meets up with &quot;the hook up&quot; and is sold something that looks identical to C4 and goes home ready to make history. Hell, the explosives are probably made by the mole because the kid doesnt have a clue about anything. &quot;Here take this.&quot;<br /><br />The &quot;day of action&quot; is set. Bomb is planted and detonator is in hand...poof. Nothing happens. SWAT team busts onto the scene and arrests are made. Media is called. &quot;Anarchist plots to terrorize and kill hundreds. Cops Save the Day. You&#039;re Safe Now&quot; says the headline. Circle-jerk on the news....someone gets promoted or assigned to better stuff. The kid enters a blackhole and lives in a concrete cell for the rest of his life...maybe tortured for names and info that dont really exist. Never a mention about the online dealings. Next trap is planned. <br /><br />I can totally see TA being used for this game.

SR already gets its share of overly righteous, &quot;think of the children!&quot; type press, and its association with TA is only going to bring on even more, especially considering recent tragic events. I think the SR powers that be need to have some serious conversations about the value of TA and whether it really needs to exist, and if it fits into the ethical code that this site abides by. I don&#039;t see how enabling a pedophile to sell or buy child porn here is morally worse than allowing a potential psychopath to buy a gun on TA. Pretty much the same level of morally reprehensible in my book.

				Just to resurrect this thread I began - integrating the feedback that&#039;s followed. Most, it seems, believe that Silk Road&#039;s sponsoring of the Armory will not make it a target. The most repeated reason seems to be because The Armory is a joke because at present it does not sell enough dangerous weapons. I think that&#039;s lame reasoning. At any moment any anonymous big time arms dealer could decide to sell bomb manufacturing equipment - the sort terrorists would love to get their hands on, heavy automatic weaponry like portable mortar, rocket launchers or the latest in rapid fire semi-automatic weapons. As one poster mentioned, there was a guy trying to sell weapon grade uranium ore the other week. It&#039;s also a venue where scammers could advertise bomb equipment and instructions to entice and dupe young, wannabe terrorists. Even if it is a joke, the joke is on Silk Road, because its Silk Road and us - both buyers and vendors - that will suffer the consequences if LE closes us down - just because of a few money-hungry weapons scammers or would-be jihadists that don&#039;t even buy (so-called) drugs on Silk Road!<br /><br />SR can&#039;t make that much from the Armory - the way it is now - so why not minimize the risk and close it down? I abhor violence (my sister&#039;s long term partner was brutally murdered last year) and I feel by selling drugs and weapons under the same roof is just confirming far right conservative thinking. Why not show LE that Silk Road does have morals (like anti-pedophilia) and is not about a bunch of hard core drug king pins selling their wares and buying their ammo from an underground internet market place? I&#039;m sure 99% of business on SR is from people who simply want to relieve stress, have fun or feel happy living in such a violent world.<br /><br />Simulacra<br /><br /><br />
