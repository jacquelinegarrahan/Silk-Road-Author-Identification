				Well, I figured I’d write this to provide a little more insight to the whole SR experience for anyone browsing these forums. I’ve read nothing but positive stories on here save for the occasional thread about “scammers” and “poor product,” so I thought I’d share mine based off of my first experience.<br /><br />I first found this site about two weeks ago. What brought me here was simple: I couldn’t find any “distractions” in my area, nor was I ever really going to make any contacts with people who provided those distractions (based off of my age, profession, group of friends/acquaintances, and locale). In any case, like most of you (I assume), I heard about it, researched it via Google, and then found my way here via a few discussion boards. <br /><br />Let me just say that I was absolutely AMAZED at what I saw when I first logged on to SR. Not in my wildest dreams would I have ever believed that this kind of stuff was available at the click of a mouse. Long story short: I quickly learned about bitcoin and PGP, transferred some $$ to my SR account… and then made a purchase. It happened so fast because I was so excited, but…<br /><br />The next day after I placed my order the worries began. What the FUCK was I thinking? I just spent the better part of my life making something out of it… and here I am about to risk it all (job, career, income, reputation, social standing, family, friends- and their careers, incomes, reputations, and FUTURES) to get something in the mail!<br /><br />Well, after two days of diarrhea it came. I went to my mailbox and brought it in my house, waited about five minutes, and then put it in my car and drove around make sure I wasn’t being followed. I figured “they” would want to see where I was taking it before “they” busted me. As you can surely assume, nobody came after me… so I went home and opened it.<br /><br />Yes, SR is real… and yes, I got exactly what I ordered, but it just seemed too good to be true. Within 15 minutes of opening the package it was destroyed… along with its contents.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the brief few minute I rationalized this decision I came up with these questions/thoughts:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s too good to be true… it usually is.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that LE is stupid/benign/impotent/over worked is, well, completely stupid. <br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if I just bought this package from LE?<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encryption… do you REALLY think the government can’t crack PGP?<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOR was created BY THE GOVERNMENT<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The War on Drugs is a failure<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What better way to fuck a SHIT LOAD of users by collecting addresses, names, information, and then launching multiple raids to not only undermine SR, but also raise a SHIT TON of $$ via the fines and fees generated. <br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, how hard is it for LE to become a “trusted” vendor on this site? They already have a shit ton of drugs, and a vendor account costs what, $150.00? Let me see… if I’m the drug czar I hire a few interns from an Ivy League school to sit behind a computer and collect addresses from across the country- pass out the product that I confiscated, and then share the info with local LE so EVERYONE can pound their chests and the operation generates HUGE media attention so the War on Drugs can go on and on and on. <br />9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I wanted to shut down medical marijuana dispensaries/growing operations… all I need to do is prove they’re breaking the law by selling on SR via a few well placed informants- who work for FREE. <br />10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1+1=2<br /><br />Sorry, but the risk just isn’t worth the reward- not for me, not by a mile. All it takes is a puncture, a rip, or a nosey postal worker to END (or severely cripple) my life. Furthermore, if this whole thing is a set-up, eventually my misdemeanors will turn into felonies… and using the post office is a FEDERAL issue. So not only do I get hit with possession, but LE can probably add five or six other charges ON TOP of that. <br /><br />Maybe I’m just paranoid… or maybe it really IS too good to be true, but I think the forums need a post like this so people can stop and THINK before they jump into the rabbit hole. While I realize that receiving these things via the mail is completely foreign to most people… it’s just insane to think that there are no strings attached.<br /><br />Feel free to flame away, what’s done is done and I’m ready to face it… the ridicule on the underweb, as well a criminal record if need be. <br />

				Not ONE post on these forums about being busted... not ONE. <br /><br />99% of the feedback remarks are grammatically correct with proper punctuation. Really, a site dedicated to this stuff- with tweekers, crack heads, and fiends and they all seem to use perfect English? Not in my experience.<br /><br />... and if I wanted to be the point man for making my questions look silly to provide comfort, I&#039;d tell you all to &quot;take a Valium.&quot;

				I think that majority of the people who use this site are white collar people, who don&#039;t know street dealers, who want anonymity.&nbsp; While they may use these hard drugs, they are not the stereotypical &quot;tweekers, crack heads, and fiends&quot;.&nbsp; SR is not for everybody, there is some risk involved, but nothing compared to using street dealers.&nbsp; I think SR is the best way to do these type of transactions in an anonymous way.

True, so if the price is too cheep it is probably a scam. But SR&#039;s existence is not too good to be true when you understand how it all works.<br /><br />2. Thinking that LE is all knowing, all seeing, and all powerful is, well, completely stupid.<br /><br />3. If you bought the package from LE then it would not have had drugs in it. At least in the US LE can not give you the drugs and let you keep them. They could not run a long sting like that as it would be putting drugs on the streets.<br /><br />4. PGP/GPG is used by the government as well as dissidents around the world. If they had broken it, there would be lots of arrests and it would be news.

They could not send out any drugs, the government can not ship drugs all over the country in a sting operation.

Think about it, someone&#039;s ex girlfriend could get on here and order drugs to they ex&#039;s place. This means that there is at least reasonable doubt as to who placed the order.<br /><br />9. What? Where did that come from? Well placed informants? I would assume that most vendors work alone or at most have a crew of two people helping. If they only sell on SR and there crew remains the same then it is hard to get a &quot;Well placed informant&quot; into place short of catching one of the crew and turning them.

SR keeps a record of your account and a lot of vendors won&#039;t sell to you if you don&#039;t have more than five transactions, which makes you WANT to build up your tally- like you&#039;re getting a good reputation on an anonymous site. Seriously, is PGP foolproof? It&#039;s not... and from what I&#039;ve read, a lot of people don&#039;t even use it. <br /><br />The crazy thing is this:<br /><br />People won&#039;t go to a street dealer for fear of getting ripped off or worse. It scares them even though they are, for the most part, anonymous. Here people give out addresses (think seizure laws) that can be linked with bitcoin purchases and tracked through your SR history. Seriously? Am I only one who is skeptical here?

I mean, why would I pound pills (and all their side effects) when I can take two hits of herb and feel calm or fall asleep? Trust me, I&#039;m for this place and what it provides, and I do realize that there is risk involved. <br /><br />1. I&#039;m getting stuff in the mail- delivered- under the guise of anonymity. How is that not too good to be true? What do prices have to do with this discussion?<br />2. We&#039;ll agree to disagree on that. While I know they&#039;re not omnipotent, I do know how tenacious they can be... especially if they&#039;re made to look bad. Do you honestly think that after a year+, LE at the federal level don&#039;t have anything in play here? That&#039;s just insane to believe.<br />3. Not true. See: Fast and Furious, Operation Wide Receiver, etc. Feds can, and will, put drugs on the street to see where they lead. Think about the bigger picture- let a year&#039;s worth of drugs go on the street to build a case against THOUSANDS of people across the county. Could you imagine the devastation a nationwide drug bust would cause when your typical &quot;guy next door&quot; is led away in cuffs? It says, &quot;Drugs are rampant, we can find you, and we will ruin your life- don&#039;t do it.&quot; Seriously, do you think a nation wide raid would encourage ANYONE to buy on-line again? Seriously?<br />4. The &quot;government&quot; does not use the PGP the public uses... and there&#039;s a reason for that. Oh, and show me a dissonant who hasn&#039;t been in jail and I&#039;ll show you a hundred who have been put to death.<br />5. No, but they profit from it. <br />6. True. It&#039;s also a lot harder to get &quot;in&quot; with good dealers, making SR a wet dream for LE.<br />7. See 2 and 3.<br />8. That&#039;s a good point. Let&#039;s say I go buy a USPS money order with cash and send it to a legitimate bitcoin business. I create another wallet account and send it out. There&#039;s a transaction/account number, right? Let&#039;s say I do that ten more times... before I send it to SR. Each transaction is stored somewhere... and your SR account has an address. It&#039;s called backtracking. Eventually they get to the business where they keep the record of your USPS money order, and unless you wore gloves, your finger prints are all over it. So, &quot;my ex-girlfriend sent it in anger&quot; doesn&#039;t hold water when backtracking shows a bank account, a bitcoin account with a valid e-mail, or even finger prints and/or debit card transactions that coincide with the purchase of said MO. <br />9. You don&#039;t know a thing. They KNOW who they want to know. All they need to do is twist an arm and POOF! There&#039;s a CI willing to give up his mother to keep out of jail. It happens all the time. Most medical grow operations in CA and CO have more than a few trusted people working for them. I&#039;m talking about the major ones, not a dude in his basement with grow lights. Some of these vendors have had product for over a year, and I don&#039;t know ANY dealer that could supply on a national/international level from his/her basement. <br />10. Very true... and there&#039;s truth to that.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to scare buyers away. I WANT to believe in this, but I think it takes these kinds of discussions to get there. <br />

That&#039;s a good point. Let&#039;s say I go buy a USPS money order with cash and send it to a legitimate bitcoin business. I create another wallet account and send it out. There&#039;s a transaction/account number, right? Let&#039;s say I do that ten more times... before I send it to SR. Each transaction is stored somewhere... and your SR account has an address. It&#039;s called backtracking. Eventually they get to the business where they keep the record of your USPS money order, and unless you wore gloves, your finger prints are all over it. So, &quot;my ex-girlfriend sent it in anger&quot; doesn&#039;t hold water when backtracking shows a bank account, a bitcoin account with a valid e-mail, or even finger prints and/or debit card transactions that coincide with the purchase of said MO. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Who buys bitcoin with money orders?<br /><br />Most do cash at 7-11 or CVS, you dont even have to show an ID to buy them. Some use a free Secondlife account to move L$ around then transfer them into an exchange and trade them for BTC.<br /><br />However, as I covered in another thread, the wallet ID&#039;s used by the bitcoin daemon which is what runs on sites like SR as well as clear net sites that accept bitcoin creates a unique wallet ID for every transaction. Thus once your coins are deposited the ID changes for the next deposit. Top that off with the fact that when you put your coins into SR and pay a vendor, the coins do not transfer from you to the vendor. They are moved in the SR system but the blocks (coins) that the vendor gets on withdraw are not the same ones you paid with. It is a FIFO system with an unknown bank amount so your coins go into the bank and the coins that are paid to the vendor are ones that were paid in by some one else.<br /><br />Now, transactions/transfers can be followed but if your bitcoin wallet is attached to the TOR network then there is no connecting IP address which means that it is hard to tell if you paid me directly, paid to an SR account,&nbsp; paid to bitfog (A service that mixes coins so there is no link between you and the coin.), or even simply paid another wallet running on a laptop. <br />

Well, perception IS reality after all.<br /><br />First off, considering this site is anonymous (even though this forum and SR somehow keep you logged in when you close TOR without logging off) analyzing/justifying my reason to post is pretty much a moot point.

I AM surprised to find that 99% of the feedback is spot on when it comes to grammar, punctuation, and to a lessor extent, spelling. Why? Well, because KIDS, who are very tech savvy yet stay pretty close to their generational euphemisms, are using proper English. They don&#039;t do that on Twitter and fb, and to think they&#039;re all of a sudden doing it here is lunacy. I realize some of you think this site and SR are some kind of super techy secret that only nerds, computer gurus, and IT techs can access, but it&#039;s not. <br /><br />I also know what tweekers, crack heads, and fiends are like because I see them quite a bit, and I&#039;ve know quite a few during my existence, which I can assure you is pretty vast. I was not born into the life I have now which is probably why I posted what I did... because I know what CAN happen from experience- my own as well as other people&#039;s. <br /><br />If you think I&#039;m LE, or associated with LE, that&#039;s on you.

It just seemed TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! I do have paranoia issues... and I don&#039;t know what LE wants me to think because I can&#039;t find any actual information about LE busting people for using this site. You would THINK that with the thousands and thousands of transactions that take place at least ONE person would come on here and say they were busted. Do a search for &quot;busted&quot; or &quot;arrested&quot; on these forums... &#039;nuff said. NOTHING is perfect, and the fact that the story of SR was somehow &quot;broken&quot; by Gawker and then less than a month or two was on the radar of two Senators... only to be forgotten, with no news references to arrests, busts, or investigation is completely alien to me. That tells me two things- LE can&#039;t do anything (which is completely unreasonable) or they WON&#039;T do anything... which as we all know is pretty much impossible because you KNOW some LE agency/official has a hard-on for SR and bringing it down. And what a better way to do it than in grand spectacle- IMO.<br /><br />Look, the whole reason I posted what I did was because the sky WAS NOT blue for me, the magic DID NOT happen. While I did get what I ordered, I panicked... In the past, I got my stuff from people I knew, and because I&#039;m relatively paranoid, I was able to CONTROL the situation. With SR, I can&#039;t control a damn thing... and that worries me.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I don&#039;t think an 1/8 or a gram of something is worth ending my employment opportunities for the rest of my life, or making my neighbors think I&#039;m some kind of criminal because the po-po show up at my house with dogs, or the rumors that my kids would have to deal with in school, or the possible impact it would have on my spouse. All I was saying is that people should THINK about the lack of control they have when ordering from the internet and receiving through the mail. This forum makes it look like everything is peachy... and I just feel that it would be better to make real contacts with real people that I can see, talk to, and do some due diligence on before I commit a misdemeanor or felony.&nbsp;

				SR is a community of many different individuals, from many walks of life. even though it&#039;s not very hard to access the road, you have to have some intelligence with learning how to buy coins anonymously, using a vpn service, bootable drive, etc. <br /><br />Many of us are, I hope anyway, are a bit paranoid security wise, and will do the most to stay anonymous. There are many ways to stay safe here on the road, but a lot of it is research and trust. I&#039;ve spent 10k in the past year and got burned once in that time. <br /><br />Think what you want to think about this place, but there are many great vendors here, just look around and pop a xanax.

				The thing about SR is that no one gets killed... it&#039;s basically impossible for violence to happen. There&#039;s people outside right now dealing in open air drug markets and there&#039;s people getting killed over it, and that&#039;s where the public outrage is and where LE resources go, and it&#039;s also easier to police. USPS is fighting to survive right now and LE budgets are tight and many are getting laid off, and so what if two senators make a fuss about SR? There&#039;s complete government gridlock. And even if they had a one trillion budget to fight this, it&#039;s impossible to permanently take down, unless you take down the internet and stop the mail.

				Wow...you&#039;re a paranoid SOB.The reality is there&#039;s no safer way to buy drugs online then through SR: I&#039;ve now had 4 transactions worth of &quot;materials&quot; that have gone off with few problems. The first was the most problematic: it was rejected by USPS for having an improper address (whatever that means) and returned to sender. I don&#039;t know if the vendor ever got the package back, but he sent me a new one with 25% more than I paid for. The next 3 for totally non-notable, except to say everything was so seamless I hardly remember the details anymore (that probably has to do with my use of the products they shipped soon after they arrived...). Things arrived in the mail just like other packages I buy off other online sites, and they look just the same. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think you can say you&#039;ve had hardly ANY experience with SR, and that&#039;s why you should get flamed. You had one successful delivery but were so overcome by paranoia (really...you drove around your neighborhood to get rid of the &quot;LE&quot;? cmon) that you couldn&#039;t think straight. It shouldn&#039;t surprised you to find out that you&#039;re not the only one that thought about these very same things: the rest of us just recognized that it was worth the risk and took precautions to make sure those risks were minimized. Unless you were buying kingpin-level amounts of drugs, you can be assured that the highly-rated vendors on this site very very rarely have ANY shipping problems, much much less anyone having to deal with the police.&nbsp;

I bet you feel they put a sensor in the drug to tell if you used it and when you did it sent a signal to the home office which alerted 200 computers and flashing lights to the fact you just took a drug and no longer have any evidence of it so they&#039;re going to come to your house and take your blood to prove you took said substance, then put you in jail for life to be touched by lonely men.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is a pretty accurate description of OP&#039;s type. But hey, at least he recognizes he doesn&#039;t belong here. If he doesn&#039;t want to &quot;take the risks&quot;, that&#039;s his prerogative and it means a smaller-scale SR for longer than if everyone accepted and spread the word about how easy and great it is. More drugs for me, and it&#039;ll be longer til SR does eventually get brought down. (which I can&#039;t reasonably foresee happening and I understand the tech, but I&#039;m keeping my eyes open for signs of LE advances just because this is ridiculous on the good/true scale.) I don&#039;t want it to end and i&#039;m secretly holding out that it&#039;ll last and start a revolution and all that good DPR shit, but that&#039;s no excuse for a less vigilant community. Everyone here&#039;s been great about explaining all the available security and other workings of the process to noobs but in the other forums some people are getting a little too comfortable with their currently &quot;untouchable&quot; status.

				A common and unchallenged assumption by many seems to be that LE has a hard-on to destroy Silk Road.&nbsp; But as far as I know, there is no evidence this is true.&nbsp; Aside from some comments made by a US Senator some time ago, there have been no political denouncements of SR I know of.&nbsp; We should assume LE is aware of and monitors SR, but I don&#039;t know of any reason to think that LE is under any political pressure to tackle SR, and&nbsp; LE probably has bigger fish to fry.&nbsp; SR may be a startling new phenomenon, but the I bet that the amount of money that runs through it is probably is less than the value of just the cocaine trade in any medium sized US city.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR is a marketplace in which mostly small scale vendors serve mostly small scale consumers.&nbsp; My impression is that LE generally doesn&#039;t pursue low level drug commerce with expensive investigations.&nbsp; &nbsp;LE might go after the site itself, but hopefully its owners know how to protect themselves, and in any case another SR will spring up if LE gets this one.&nbsp; The idea some agency would spend much money busting someone for receiving a small amount of drugs at her or his home seems unlikely to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />We Silk Roadsters can&#039;t presume to know LE&#039;s perspective regarding SR, but as far as keeping the peace goes, LE might even have reason to be relieved at SR&#039;s growth.&nbsp; After all, because SR sales go through the mail, its commerce is associated with little or none of the violence and mayhem of street level drug sales; no bystanders are wounded by stray bullets, no political systems are being corrupted, and few taxes are even being evaded.&nbsp; As far as public safety and order goes, SR is probably a good thing since it reduces the amount of street level drug sales.&nbsp; Heck,&nbsp; Sr is probably a bigger threat to organized crime than it is to the public welfare.&nbsp;

				Regarding LE:<br />1. LE has to prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that it was you who purchased the item, and it was not, for example shipped to the wrong address by typo.<br />2. LE can not run such sting operation for long, since they would be distributing large amount of drugs all over the world, this would not end well for the LE&#039;s reputation.

				In response to the OP about nobody reporting busts on here: the fact is, if somebody does get busted for receiving drugs in the mail, they are very unlikely to come on here and talk about it. I&#039;d be keeping a very low profile!<br />It&#039;s difficult to say how many such busts have occurred. You occassionally have threads where SR is mentioned in relation to a prosecution but usually the victim has either confessed or been caught dealing drugs IRL.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As far as the paranoia goes: it&#039;s as well to keep a healthy level of caution but what you describe is ridiculous! You destroyed the drugs?! I bet it was a gram of pot too! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It just sounds like you are justifying your paranoia to yourself so you don&#039;t feel bad about not daring to use the site.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know what you mean about the lack of control. Really, you&#039;re much more likely to be busted buying drugs in real life. But that time while your package is in the mail is nerve wracking because you have no control of events. It&#039;s why people fear flying over driving, even though flying is safer.

SR is totally legit 110%. and everyone using this site i really hope for the best to you all specially some of the professional vendors on here yous are fukn legends i hope ya make millions of dollars and set ya self up for early retirement and live large :) im taking full advantage of SR to benefit for my self.. FUK BITCHES GET MONEY&nbsp; &nbsp;

Perhaps LE aren&#039;t fools, though: perhaps thats why (among many reasons) SR still stands. People ordering and delivering products from the comfort of their home, no violence, no weapons, no threats, and no fraud (that&#039;s allowed to continue for too long, anyhow). LE should love this place: it makes their job much easier (that is, if their job is to &quot;serve and protect&quot;)
