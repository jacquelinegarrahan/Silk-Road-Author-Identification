				How possible is it to &quot;stash&quot; your bitcoins?<br /><br />..by &quot;stash&quot;, I mean holding onto them in your SR account and letting your money increase by the market?<br /><br />For instance, I had $5.00 in my account leftover from purchases a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; As of this morning, I have almost $19.&nbsp; That&#039;s over 3x as much money from simply waiting.&nbsp; I was thinking of just dumping all of my cash here and letting the market price go up a bit and then cashing out for a nice increase in profit without having to make any effort.<br /><br />Anyone here do this often?&nbsp; Worth it?&nbsp; Too risky?

				Aye, I was thinking of leaving them in my Bitfloor account.&nbsp; This will allow me to place them on the same market I purchased from once they&#039;ve increased a bit.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking at the long-term exchange rates and trying to decide if it&#039;s a safe investment.&nbsp; I would need to invest in quite a few coins to make it worth it.&nbsp; ~$40 extra over a couple of weeks from 2 bitcoins isn&#039;t really enough to make the risk worth it.

				Keep in mind bitfloor was hacked last year and its users lost 24,000 BTC.&nbsp; Awesome site but probably not the safest place for long term stashing!<br />

				I just want to make sure everyone knows about offline wallets. You don&#039;t need to rely on a third party like mtgox, instawallet, etc to hold onto your funds if they are on your hard drive.

				As avast had stated, you should be using offline wallets.<br />NEVER store your Bitcoin in an online wallet. Doing so is similar to giving your cash to a random guy on the street and saying &quot;Hey, mind this for me for a while until I need it. Thanks.&quot;<br /><br />You should be keeping your Bitcoin encrypted on your own machine, and with at least 3 encrypted backups - one in the cloud, one on a USB stick / SD card, and one that you&#039;ve emailed yourself. Again, all strongly encrypted. It wouldn&#039;t hurt also to have a brain-wallet and / or paper wallet.<br /><br />This is currency at the end of the day. Who do you trust holding your fiat currency for you? Treat Bitcoin the same way - realise that it is only as secure as YOU make it.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				you can download the blockchain as a torrent or zip then force recheck. You&#039;ll find instructions on google. Offline wallets are definitely best, make sure they are encrypted too :)

It&#039;s like a bottomless cup. I&#039;m not sure how long it can go on.<br /><br />I also think this means that certain vendors have made an absolute KILLING, depending on how quickly they were cashing in their coins, and while I kick myself daily for not having put more $ into coins, myself, I imagine it&#039;s nothing like the pain some vendors must be feeling for cashing in too early with far, far more coins ready to triple/quadruple/quintuple in value. This thing will have already created some instant millionaires.

Google &quot;bitcoin Speculation&quot; and head to the first link.
