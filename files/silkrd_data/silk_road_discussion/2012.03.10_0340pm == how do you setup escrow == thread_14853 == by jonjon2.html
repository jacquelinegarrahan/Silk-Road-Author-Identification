				Escrow is automatic. Your money sits in escrow until you finalize, which you should do ONLY after you&#039;ve received your purchase (unless you know/are comfortable with your vendor.) This way, if you are scammed, you have some recourse to get your funds back.<br /><br />If the vendor asks you to finalize before receiving, make sure they are trusted and search them on the forums. Some vendors require FE for new buyers... Should say so on there seller page.

				Before you buy from someone go to their sellers page (just click on their name) and read their terms of service. Some might say new buyers have to finalize early probably best to avoid those type unless they are LONG time members who have a 99 or 100 next to their name.
