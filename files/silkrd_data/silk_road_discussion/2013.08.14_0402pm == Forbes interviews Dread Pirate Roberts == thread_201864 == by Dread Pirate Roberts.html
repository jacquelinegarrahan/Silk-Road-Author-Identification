				I enjoyed the article.<br /><br />DPR, you are an assest to the libertarian community, as if you didnt already think that. Many young freedom-lovers who are just begining to see the pitfalls of an opressive government (high taxes, no guns, bad food/medicine, and unjust laws) will now have an outlet for their freedom.<br />I am excited to see the new blood that will be brought into SR and im sure a TON of new sellers/buyers will join our cause.<br /><br />What i personally am anticipating is those new additions to SRF. Along with an influx of buyers/sellers on the marketplace, we will see a ton of new blood on the forums. Im talking about security innovations and other ways to improve what we have on SR. These new members will learn and teach others and the more like-minded (in their perosnal/political beliefs) people here, the more brainpower we have to avoid LE.<br /><br />I think you called to much attention to BTC in the interview however. The feds already know what crypto curremcies are used for and they know that BTC is pretty much the weak link for SR. Basically if noone can get BTC noone can use SR. Thats why many sites have been shut down. So prepare for more LE harassment on the BTC exchanges.<br /><br />I liked learning a little bit more of SR/DPR history. I haven&#039;t been here since the begining, but pretty close to it.<br /><br />TO DPR (the current and all previous) : I thank you immensely for what you have done for those who have a passion for freedom. Keep up the hard work, dont let the wrong things influence you and most importantly, continue trusting noone.<br /><br />Enjoy that bowl pack brother! Youve certainly earned it along with those other &#039;first-world pleasures&#039;!

				I&#039;m thrilled to see positive responses so far.&nbsp; I thought the article was decent as well.&nbsp; There was quite a bit more to the interview than was published.&nbsp; It took about 6 hours to conduct if I remember correctly.&nbsp; Andy mentioned that he&#039;d like to publish the whole thing word for word, so hopefully that will go up today as well.

BTC in and of itself cannot be shut down. just as bit torrent can not be shut down. distributed networks are excellent with regards to robust staying power.<br /><br />so now you have a ton of buyers that want BTC to use in exchange for goods and a ton of sellers that HAVE coins that they can do basically nothing with. see where i&#039;m going with this?&nbsp; SR will still work because somehow, someway a buyer and a seller will figure out how to transfer BTC from one to the other, and then back again. with the resulting underlying transfer being cash and goods. be that cash in mail, bank deposit, some international shenanigans where the local law doesnt reach, or whatever. there will ALWAYS be a way to get something to someone and receive proper payment for it.<br /><br />BTC is and has always been nothing more than an intrinsic unit of value. that value being dictated purely by supply and demand. it&#039;s backed by nothing more than people wanting it. it is effectively currency for currency&#039;s sake.<br /><br />also, this doesnt even take miners into consideration, which is a totally legal endeavor in its own right. <br /><br />you can talk about BTC till you&#039;re blue in the face. wont change anything in my opinion.&nbsp; personally, i feel all this subpena nonsense the feds are doing to all the BTC-related companies is not for drug war purposes, but instead for money laundering &amp; tax evasion purposes. governments want their tax money and they know BTC isnt going away. they&#039;re a bit scared since they dont know what to do about it. looks like they&#039;re trying to be proactive and nip it in the bud with regulations. too bad for them the genie is already out of the bottle....<br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb

				Excellent piece, well written and looks like he&#039;s kept his word on the editorial control, and hasn&#039;t took any narrative liberties! Especially love the analogy at the end. I think you showed how modest you are, and why 2-3 years down the line we are still thriving under your leadership. So ironic that most people who make Forbes, are actually loving and encouraging the attention. But we can safely say, your place in history is already set in stone. You must look at yourself , and say,&quot; I&#039;ve made it.&quot; I&#039;ve actually achieved something monumental,&quot; and I think that means more to you than any recognition, or attention. Loved the story of how you helped rather than sabotaged, the original founder&#039;s flaw in wallets. Bravo!&nbsp; 6 hours! the things you do for us!<br /><br />I can imagine you chilling with a nice Indica spliff, and musing on the article!

The current Roberts discovered the site shortly after its creation in early 2011. Around that time, he says, he found a security flaw in the “wallet” software that stored Silk Road’s funds. The bug could have allowed a hacker to identify the site’s hardware and steal its Bitcoins. Instead of exploiting the weakness, he helped the site’s founder fix it, gained his trust and became an active partner in the business. Eventually, the current Roberts says, he bought out Silk Road’s creator and assumed full control. “It was his idea to pass the torch, in fact,” says Roberts. “He was well compensated.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So its official then, the DPR we know today is not the DPR who started the site. <br /><br />I wonder how many other critical bugs exist in Silk Road&#039;s infrastructure. It doesn&#039;t seem unlikely that if the current DPR was able to identify something catastrophic in SR&#039;s code that a more talented programmer with a little time and motivation wouldn&#039;t also be able to do. This doesn&#039;t really give me much confidence in SR and I don&#039;t know how wise it was to include something like that in the article. <br /><br />Take for example what has recently happened with people being logged into others accounts without ever meaning or trying to do so. Just a random &quot;conflict&quot; bug apparently which had a 1 in 10²⁶&nbsp; chance of happening. Yet someone else (if not multiple others) are reporting that this has also happened to them since it was apparently &quot;fixed&quot;. Nothing about this has been addresses yet and it raises a lot of discomfort and questions.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some of those questions I raised in another thread - <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=193324.msg1448572#msg1448572">Quote from: HEATFan on August 14, 2013, 04:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I wonder what someone malicious would actually be capable of doing? Finalizing orders, viewing sensitive messages, sending messages to possibly scam people who trust the authentic account owner, and changing feedback on vendors. Or what if someone got access to a vendors account this way? They would potentially be able to view all of the messages on the account, some which may contain addresses and such. I don&#039;t have a vendors account so I don&#039;t know what else but I imagine they could cancel orders, message customers and somehow scam them offsite, or whatever else would be possible had this happened on a vendors account. It worries me that nobody has addressed this yet. Is SR safe to use right now?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As each day passes I have less and less faith in these vehicles we use to gain and maintain our freedoms. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love SR as much as the next guy, but I&#039;m beginning to feel as if it isn&#039;t as safe as we all think. We&#039;re just pawns in this game that is being played and outside of not trusting anyone at all I don&#039;t think anything we do here is as secure as we seem to think. Just my 2 cents. <br /><br />All that negativity aside, I am still glad to be a part of this place and I hope it continues to thrive. Thanks for maintaining this ship for us DPR and I wish you all the best especially when you need it most. Long live DPR!

				nice article! SR will live FOREVER.<br />in the end only true believers will be using the site. <br />BTC will only rise in value , over time, the only situation i can think of losing its price, is if governments acquire so many BTC, that they would be able to bring the price to whatever level they want.<br />But i think this is going to hurt only investors, people who use bitcoin don&#039;t really care about the price... the VALUE is always the same. <br />Another factor i am afraid of, is whether the governments will close the BTC exchange sites, one after another.<br /><br />I believe Bitcoin is the future, and some junkies may become rich out of nowhere :) some have already become. <br /><br />Fuck man, if only i could tell you how i found about Silk Road........... LIFE has driven me to Silk Road with the help of many many individual facts / problems that rose during some period of my life...<br />really DPR, I could only tell you my story in PM, it is really interesting.....

				Pretty cool article.&nbsp; I wish it had mentioned the distinct lack of violence, and increased safety we have dealing this way, instead of visiting sketchy dealers.&nbsp; Congrats DPR, you came off as an intelligent and principled individual, and the timing of this article coinciding with that US senator announcing fewer drug arrests and lighter penalties is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s pretty neat that DPR isn&#039;t Silk Road, the original owner.&nbsp; I do hope the OG that started this still at least uses or drops by the road, to watch his old baby grow and prosper... though it would be funny as hell if he was the one that started Atlantis as a way of coming out of retirement.&nbsp; ;)

				DPR, I thought the article was well done and your interview was great. Normally I brush off people who say &quot;we&#039;re part of this pro-libertarian anti-government movement&quot;, but I think after this article I&#039;m finally feeling it. We&#039;re part of the revolution. Fuck yeah.<br /><br />That being said, I have two questions:<br /><br />1. If the title of DPR has been passed off before, was the same PGP key passed? If so, how can we trust your PGP key?<br /><br />2. What&#039;s the rationale behind silkroadlink.com? Won&#039;t it bring a lot of people who don&#039;t care about their security, posing a security threat to themselves?

				Entire article Repost:<br /><br />FORBES | 8/14/2013 @ 11:31AM |16,757 views<br />Meet The Dread Pirate Roberts, The Man Behind Booming Black Market Drug Website Silk Road<br />This story appears in the September 2, 2013 issue of Forbes.<br /><br />An entrepreneur as professionally careful as the Dread Pirate Roberts doesn’t trust instant messaging services. Forget phones or Skype. At one point during our eight-month preinterview courtship, I offer to meet him at an undisclosed location outside the United States. “Meeting in person is out of the question,” he says. “I don’t meet in person even with my closest advisors.” When I ask for his name and nationality, he’s so spooked that he refuses to answer any other questions and we lose contact for a month.<br /><br />All my communications with Roberts are routed exclusively through the messaging system and forums of the website he owns and manages, the Silk Road. Accessing the site requires running the anonymity software Tor, which encrypts Web traffic and triple-bounces it among thousands of computers around the world. Like a long, blindfolded ride in the back of some guerrilla leader’s van, Tor is designed to prevent me–and anyone else–from tracking the location of Silk Road’s servers or the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. “The highest levels of government are hunting me,” says Roberts. “I can’t take any chances.”<br /><br />If Roberts is paranoid, it’s because very powerful people really are out to get him. In the last two and a half years Silk Road has grown into the Web’s busiest bazaar for heroin, methamphetamines, crack, cocaine, LSD, ecstasy and enough strains of marijuana to put an Amsterdam coffee shop to shame. The Drug Enforcement Agency won’t comment on whether it’s investigating Silk Road but wrote in a statement that it’s aware of the site and is “very proactive in keeping abreast” of the digital underground’s “ever-evolving technological advancements.” Senator Chuck Schumer has demanded Silk Road be shut down and called it “the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen … by light-years.”<br /><br />Anyone can download and run Tor, exchange some dollars or euros for the digital currency Bitcoin and go shopping on Silk Road for drugs that are vacuum-sealed and discreetly mailed via the U.S. Postal Service, right under the federal government’s nose. By the measure of Carnegie Mellon researcher Nicolas Christin, Roberts’ eBay-like service was grossing $1.2 million a month in the first half of 2012. Since then the site has doubled its product listings, and revenue now hits an annual run-rate of $30 million to $45 million by FORBES’ estimate. One analysis of the Tor network performed by a student at Dublin’s Trinity College found that Silk Road received around 60,000 visits a day, mostly users seeking to buy or sell drugs, along with other illicit items including unregulated cigarettes and forged documents. Silk Road takes a commission on all of its sales, starting at 10% and scaling down for larger transactions. Given that those commissions are collected in Bitcoins, which have appreciated close to 200-fold against the dollar since Silk Road launched in 2011, the Dread Pirate Roberts and any other stakeholders in Silk Road have likely amassed millions in profits.<br /><br />Despite the giant DEA crosshairs painted on his back and growing signs that the feds are probing the so-called “dark Web” that Silk Road and other black market sites inhabit, Roberts spoke with FORBES in his first-ever extended public interview for a reason: As with physical drug dealing, a turf war has emerged. Competitors, namely a newly launched site called Atlantis with a real marketing budget and a CEO with far less regard for his privacy, are stealing Roberts’ spotlight.<br /><br />“Up until now I’ve done my best to keep Silk Road as low profile as possible … letting people discover [it] through word of mouth,” Roberts says. “At the same time, Silk Road has been around two and a half years. We’ve withstood a lot, and it’s not like our enemies are unaware any longer.”<br /><br />Roberts also has a political agenda: He sees himself not just as an enabler of street-corner pushers but also as a radical libertarian revolutionary carving out an anarchic digital space beyond the reach of the taxation and regulatory powers of the state–Julian Assange with a hypodermic needle. “We can’t stay silent forever. We have an important message, and the time is ripe for the world to hear it,” says Roberts. “What we’re doing isn’t about scoring drugs or ‘sticking it to the man.’ It’s about standing up for our rights as human beings and refusing to submit when we’ve done no wrong.”<br /><br />“Silk Road is a vehicle for that message,” he writes to me from somewhere in the Internet’s encrypted void. “All else is secondary.”<br /><br />While Roberts waxes philosophical, his competitors are finding motivation enough in grabbing some of Silk Road’s lucrative drug trade. On June 26 a video ad for Atlantis appeared on YouTube telling the story of “Charlie,” a friendly-looking cartoon hipster. Charlie, according to text that popped up around the video’s frame as jingly music played, is a “stoner” who moves to a new city for work and can’t find any marijuana. That is, until he discovers Atlantis’ “virtual black market,” orders some pot and gets “high as a damn kite.”<br /><br />YouTube removed the video within days for violating its terms of service but not before it had received close to 100,000 views and pulled the new Bitcoin-based black market into the public Internet’s awareness. Atlantis’ ad took a direct shot at Silk Road, calling itself “the world’s best anonymous online drug marketplace.”<br /><br />The next day, an employee of Atlantis named “Heisenberg” held a group chat with reporters where he described the site as the “Facebook to [Silk Road&#039;s] Myspace.” In comments now deleted from an ask-me-anything session on the social news site Reddit, Atlantis’ chief executive, who goes by the name “Vladimir,” listed advantages over Silk Road like less downtime and smaller fees for sellers. “The road has more users,” he wrote, “but our site is better (to put it bluntly).”<br /><br />The battle for the Web’s drug corner is on.<br /><br />***<br /><br />THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS isn’t shy about naming Silk Road’s active ingredient: The cryptographic digital currency known as Bitcoin. “We’ve won the State’s War on Drugs because of Bitcoin,” he writes.<br /><br />Bitcoin, which came into widespread use around the same time as Silk Road’s creation, isn’t exactly the financial-privacy panacea some believe it to be–its transactions can be traced using the same mechanisms that prevent fraud and counterfeiting within the Bitcoin economy. But unlike with dollars, euros or yen, the integrity of the nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoins floating around the Internet is maintained by the distributed computing power of thousands of users who run the crypto-currency’s software, not by any bank or government. That means careful users never have to tie their accounts to their real-world identity. As a result Bitcoin-funded services deep within the dark Web, masked by anonymity tools like Tor, claim to offer everything from cyberattacks to weapons and explosives to stolen credit cards.<br /><br />Mix up your coins in one of many available laundering services–Silk Road runs one automatically for all transactions on the site–and it becomes very difficult to follow the money. Even the FBI, according to one of the bureau’s leaked internal reports, worries that Bitcoin’s complexity and lack of a central authority “present distinct challenges” for tracking criminal funds. The result is a currency as convenient as PayPal and theoretically as anonymous as cash.<br /><br />“We’re talking about the potential for a monumental shift in the power structure of the world,” Roberts writes. “The people now can control the flow and distribution of information and the flow of money. Sector by sector the State is being cut out of the equation and power is being returned to the individual.”<br /><br />Of course, Roberts’ lofty words on individual liberties provide a convenient veneer to justify his profitable business selling illegal, dangerous and addictive substances. But Roberts argues that if his users want heroin and crack, they should have the freedom to buy it and deal with the consequences. Unlike other Bitcoin-based underground sites, Silk Road bans all but what Roberts defines as victimless contraband. He won’t permit the sale of child pornography, stolen goods or weapons, though the latter is a gray area. The site has experimented with selling guns and may yet reintroduce them, Roberts says.<br /><br />PAGE 2 OF 2<br /><br />Aside from the thorny ethics of the Bitcoin underground economy, the currency’s wild fluctuations present a more practical problem. Silk Road allows the site’s dealers to peg their Bitcoin prices to the dollar, so that a typical gram of heroin on the site costs around $200 regardless of whether Bitcoins are worth 50 cents apiece, as in early 2011, or $266, at their precrash peak in April 2013. (They’re around $100 today.) The site also offers a currency hedging system that protects dealers against swings in Bitcoin’s value while their drugs are in transit.<br /><br />Bitcoin did more than enable the modern online black market, Roberts says. It also brought him and Silk Road together. Roberts isn’t actually the site’s founder, he revealed in our interview. He credits Silk Road’s creation to another, even more secretive entrepreneur whom he declined to tell me anything about and who may have used the “Dread Pirate Roberts” nom de guerre before it was assumed by the person I interviewed. The current Roberts discovered the site shortly after its creation in early 2011. Around that time, he says, he found a security flaw in the “wallet” software that stored Silk Road’s funds. The bug could have allowed a hacker to identify the site’s hardware and steal its Bitcoins. Instead of exploiting the weakness, he helped the site’s founder fix it, gained his trust and became an active partner in the business. Eventually, the current Roberts says, he bought out Silk Road’s creator and assumed full control. “It was his idea to pass the torch, in fact,” says Roberts. “He was well compensated.”<br /><br />In February 2012 a post appeared on Silk Road’s forums proclaiming that the site’s administrator would henceforth be known as the Dread Pirate Roberts, a name taken from the dashing, masked protagonist in the fantasy film The Princess Bride –tellingly, a persona that is passed down in the film from one generation of pirate to another. He soon began to live up to his colorful alter ego, posting lofty manifestos about Silk Road’s libertarian political ideals and love letters to his faithful users and vendors; he’s even hosted a Dread Pirate Roberts Book Club where he moderated discussions on authors from the Austrian school of free market economics. Commenters on the site describe Roberts as a “hero,” a “job creator,” “our own Che Guevara” and a “name [that] will live [on] among the greatest men and women in history as a soldier of justice and freedom.”<br /><br />When I ask Roberts how he defines his role at Silk Road–CEO? Owner?–he tells me that he considers himself “a center of trust” between the site’s buyers and sellers, a tricky task given that all parties want to remain anonymous. Silk Road has slowly demonstrated to users that it isn’t a typical counterfeit-drug scam site or a law enforcement trap. It’s made wise use of the trust mechanisms companies like eBay and Airbnb have popularized, including seller ratings and an escrow that releases payment to sellers only after customers receive their merchandise.<br /><br /><br />“Silk Road doesn’t really sell drugs. It sells insurance and financial products,” says Carnegie Mellon computer engineering professor Nicolas Christin. “It doesn’t really matter whether you’re selling T-shirts or cocaine. The business model is to commoditize security.”<br /><br />With millions flowing into Silk Road, the “vast majority” of which Roberts says is reinvested back in its booming black market, the Dread Pirate brushes off questions about his wealth and lifestyle. He says he carefully limits his spending to keep a low profile but admitted in one forum post to partaking in a few “first-world pleasures.” The only such pleasure he would describe to me is smoking “a bowl of sticky indica buds at the end of a long day.”<br /><br />“As far as my monetary net worth is concerned, the future value of Silk Road as an organization dwarfs its and my liquid assets. … I wouldn’t sell out for less than 10 figures, maybe 11,” he writes with a dash of vainglory. “At some point you’re going to have to put Dread Pirate Roberts on that list you all keep over at Forbes. ;)”<br /><br />***<br /><br />IT’S A RULE AS TIMELESS as black markets: Where illegal money goes, violence follows. In a digital market that violence is virtual, but it’s as financially real as torching your competitor’s warehouse.<br /><br />In late April Silk Road went offline for nearly a week, straining under a sustained cyberattack that left its sensitive data untouched but overwhelmed its servers. The attack, according to Roberts, was the most sophisticated in Silk Road’s history, taking advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in Tor and repeatedly shifting tactics to avoid the site’s defenses.<br /><br />The sabotage occurred within weeks of rival site Atlantis’ launch. Commenters on the Reddit forum devoted to Silk Road suggested that Roberts’ customers and vendors switch to Atlantis during the downtime, leading to gossip that the newcomer had engineered the attack.<br /><br />“Rumors, nothing more than that,” says Atlantis’ CEO Vladimir when I interview him in an encrypted chat room. (Like Roberts, Vlad doesn’t share much about himself, other than a background in software development, some experience as a small-time pot dealer and a love of psychedelics.) “I have suspicions [about whether] an attack ever took place. It’s far more likely they were having infrastructure issues.”<br /><br />Roberts, for his part, won’t comment on the April attack’s source. He tells me he’s happy to see competition in the Web drug market, even as Atlantis boasted in June that it surpassed $500,000 in cumulative transactions. Roberts points out that another site, Black Market Reloaded, has long copied Silk Road’s model–even offering a wider variety of merchandise, including illegal firearms–while still attracting only a small fraction of Roberts’ customers. “I like having them nipping at my heels,” Roberts tells me. “Keeps me motivated.”<br /><br />In a comment on “copycats” posted to Silk Road’s forums a few days after Atlantis released its video ad, however, Roberts seemed to fire back. “If you take someone’s invention, tweak one little thing and then go around telling everyone that you are ‘better,’ you get zero respect from me,” he wrote. Though the rest of the message focused on the difference between Bitcoin and a newer crypto-currency called Litecoin, users interpreted the comment as a thinly veiled dig at Atlantis.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Silk Road has also been adopting some of Atlantis’ marketing tactics: In addition to Roberts’ first real interview, he’s created a new public site at SilkRoadLink.com that serves as an online guide to accessing Silk Road, bringing his business, at least tentatively, outside Tor’s obscured network.<br /><br />Competition aside, Roberts has chosen a risky time to raise his profile, as law enforcement tightens its net. Dealers in South Carolina and Australia have been arrested after allegedly selling on Silk Road, although both may have also been dealing in the physical world. In May the proprietors of a Bitcoin-like digital currency system called Liberty Reserve were indicted and accused of helping to launder $6 billion. That same month the biggest Bitcoin currency exchange, Tokyo’s Mt. Gox, announced it would require identification for anyone seeking to trade in real world currencies. Then, last month, the FBI exploited a vulnerability in Tor to capture the alleged administrator of a child pornography site in Ireland. And, perhaps most threatening to Roberts, the NSA has been revealed to have fed intelligence to the DEA and other law enforcement agencies.<br /><br />All of that gives Roberts good reason to distrust any means of communication and payment that could possibly be cracked by law enforcement. In 2012 the operators of a Silk Road-like site known as the Farmer’s Market were identified and indicted in a DEA operation called “Adam Bomb.” Though they had used Tor to hide their domain, they had communicated with one another using the encrypted e-mail service Hushmail, a service known to cooperate with law enforcement, and had accepted payments through PayPal instead of Bitcoin. Just days after Atlantis’ Vladimir insisted that he and his “chief operating officer” communicate with me using an encrypted IM program called Cryptocat, a bug in the program was revealed that could have allowed all of our communications to be read.<br /><br />Despite his caution, Roberts’ personal security remains an open question. But the potential lifetime in prison he might face if identified hasn’t slowed down his growing illegal empire. “We are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor,” he wrote in one speech posted to the site’s forums last year. “It’s a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society. But the environment is rapidly changing, and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road.”<br /><br />—<br />

We&#039;re part of the revolution. Fuck yeah.<br /><br />That being said, I have two questions:<br /><br />1. If the title of DPR has been passed off before, was the same PGP key passed? If so, how can we trust your PGP key?<br /><br />2. What&#039;s the rationale behind silkroadlink.com? Won&#039;t it bring a lot of people who don&#039;t care about their security, posing a security threat to themselves?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1. The DPR key was passed off to me.&nbsp; You make a good point though that the original DPR could pose as the current, so when that key is used, you are in a sense trusting the present and past DPRs.&nbsp; I was actually just thinking of updating the key.<br /><br />2. It will hopefully help people learn about SR, Tor and Bitcoin.&nbsp; It&#039;s really up to them how deep down the security rabbit hole they want to go, but I think things are secure enough that it won&#039;t be a big issue.

				DPRs will be long gone before they die from ill health or old age. They are all here short term to make a quick buck, squeezing us for every cent like blood from a stone before passing the gauntlet on to someone else. This is why the fees were jacked up recently, so the incumbent DPR can get a quicker payback on his investment and make a profit before passing it on to someone else who will again jack up fees yet again.

Bite me, we are going to TAX YOU! You with that fancy suit, come here, your pants are way too short, 20 years in jail. YOU THERE COME HERE! work for the DE*? Join the cartels in prison, LIFE! <br /><br />Not sure if this is making sense but i&#039;m a little bit slow since i opened that special bottle of scotch for our main man DPR<br /><br />Cheers DPR and SR brothers!&nbsp; ;D

				Also, it was definitely apparent fees were increesed to recoup the massive amounts invested. And DPR will never die. DPR is not a being but a legacy. <br /><br />I enjoy the more engaged DP anyhow. He&#039;s enjoying his community he&#039;s sworn to protect. Of course the more behind the scenes and calculated DPR&#039;ssss will be missed but I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll look in on us from time to time like some super hero parent in some super hero movie to make sure we&#039;re doing alright :)

				This here is the best answer for me, and one that I will use in my arguments about drugs.<br /><br />&quot;Do you feel any moral guilt about selling highly addictive and dangerous drugs to users and even to dealers? Don’t drugs like crack and heroin have harmful effects on your customers and on society? And couldn’t even children manage to get access to them through the Silk Road?”<br /><br />On the contrary, I am proud of what I do.&nbsp; I can’t think of one drug that doesn’t have at least some harmful effects.&nbsp; That’s really not the point though.&nbsp; People own themselves, they own their bodies, and it is their right to put into their bodies whatever they choose.&nbsp; It’s not my place, or the government’s, or anyone else’s to say what a person does with their own body.&nbsp; Giving people that freedom of choice and the dignity of self-ownership is a good thing.<br /><br />If someone uses drugs, then goes on to hurt other people, then of course they should be held accountable for their actions, whether they were using drugs or not, but to paint all drug users as “harmful to society” and try to throw them all in cages is despicable and does much more harm to communities and families than drugs ever could.&nbsp; Further, using children to appeal to people’s fears is irresponsible.&nbsp; There are many dangers facing children, the least of which include obtaining Bitcoins, configuring their computer to access Tor and Silk Road, navigating the site to make a purchase, and getting the package delivered past their parents.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of parents and those they trust to educate their children about drugs and everything else they will have to make decisions about in their life.&nbsp; Again, not my place, or the government’s, or anyone else’s.&quot;

				after reading the whole(rather engaging) interview with Forbes I can say with some degree of certainty that what i have learned is that DPR smokes weeeedd.<br /><br /><br />All joking aside, good talk DPR. Nice to see you peer out of the shadows every now and again.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Personally I feel you speaking more lately (even of the forums here) is to help combat Atlantis; I am all about it.<br /><br /><br />Stay safe, because only by keeping yourself safe are you able to keep all of us safe!!!<br /><br /><br />and for that I for one am thankful!

You did not reveal too much but at the same time you gave a big middle finger to the DEA, NSA and IRS. lol I have the utmost respect for you. <br /><br />Also, I am glad to see you actively posting on the forums.

That can cost anywhere from $5 a month for a small VPS to hundreds of dollars a month for a dedicated server with unmetered bandwidth. I think any little bit helps the Tor network, though.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post a tutorial on how to setup a relay, probably tomorrow.&nbsp; It will be *almost* copy-paste easy, but you&#039;ll have to change some things for your specific server, like the bandwidth limits.<br /><br /><br />

				It was a good interview, thank you DPR.<br /><br />There are some points in there that I would like to debate philosophically, as the point of the &quot;freedom for the masses&quot; that - as Nietzsche proved much too well - it is just utopia given how the mass possess a collective brain while freedom requires individual intelligence, but this is naturally an ample topic that would need a thread of its own or a dedicated discussion; maybe in the future we will have the opportunity to enter it in the specific.

				Interesting read.&nbsp; Hell, I&#039;d read DPR&#039;s laundry folding tips if it was published.&nbsp; When people have all these questions about the Captain, but there&#039;s nothing to ever read, we get a little hard up for some crumbs.<br /><br />One thing I wished had made at least a paragraph, is the safety aspect of the Road.&nbsp; Points made about how much safer it is to buy from the Road, then be-bopping down to the ghetto and taking your chances.&nbsp; When buying off the streets, you don&#039;t know what the hell you&#039;re getting when it comes to many kinds of drugs, and you don&#039;t know if you&#039;re going to come back home with you&#039;re face bashed in, a few air vents in your chest, your wallet and car missing, or the many other ways you can get ripped off.<br /><br />Taking into account Forbes reader base, I think showing how much more safer the Road is, compared to cold copping, would be something the readers could wrap their head around and endorse.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d type more, but my eyelids are falling down right now.

				Hi dpr, Well, You certainly have changed your tone regarding interviews etc :) <br />I was fairly shocked to see you doing one, You dont need to try and compete with atlantis, Those cock bastards wont last forever, neither will we, but we will last much longer, Hell we might even evolve enough to last a good 20 years as long as we keep up.<br /><br />I noticed this in the article. <br />&quot;Silk Road bans all but what Roberts defines as victimless contraband. He won’t permit the sale of child pornography, stolen goods or weapons, though the latter is a gray area. The site has experimented with selling guns and may yet reintroduce them, Roberts says.&quot; <br /><br />Is the armory being re-introduced? <br /><br />Anyways, Stay safe, I wish you the best.<br />SW

The NSA can watch everything that happens on Amazon&#039;s networks, but the NSA doesn&#039;t care about Iranian dissidents. They want those dissidents to access the internet and leak intel about the Iranian government. Our threat model is different. We need to diversify away from the NSA - GCHQ - Euro Intel Coop. Right now, those cooperating intelligence agencies can watch a majority of the Tor network. If they become a global passive adversary, we lose. We have to move the Tor network outside of their surveillance zone.

				Just want to throw a big thank you out to DPR and the SR community. I am fairly new to the road but not at all new to drugs. At times I have struggled with addiction and at others just used for recreational purposes and I wouldn&#039;t change any of it. The path I have taken has molded me as a person and I am proud of who I am. Not only am I saving money through SR, I do not have to put myself in danger the way I used to to find my substance of &#039;choice&#039;. Also I am contributing to help fight the good fight!<br /><br />What DPR and Silk Road is doing is truly revolutionary and people are gonna look back on what is/has been done here and speak about it for generations. I think the Forbes article came off in a positive light and DPR handled it like a pro. It shows intellect and does not seem like profit is the goal at all. I cannot praise you enough DPR for the way you handled yourself and I really believe that article will get peoples minds ticking...Maybe even shine a new light on what is really going on here. <br /><br />Thanks again DPR and thanks to the community!&nbsp; 8)

				&quot;Can you tell me anything about the total sales on the site and how fast it’s growing? How many users it has? How much profit you’re making?<br /><br />No comment.&quot;<br /><br /><br />perhaps could mention user Nos, understand may not been wise to boast about profits.<br /><br />TWM

				Not to ruin the wave of adulation but you know the DEA is going to drop this issue of Forbes on Obama&#039;s desk and ask for triple the resources to come after you claiming you are attempting to spread propaganda and are now a risk to national security as a rogue political actor. Nothing feds hate more than being made to look like fools, gives them extra focus, incentive and resolve to crush you by any means possible. Satoshi never gave any interviews for a good reason. I&#039;m sure every paper on earth would love to hear his about his politics and reasons for creating BTC and yet we never hear from him. Strategically a sound move on his part. <br /><br />I also found an interesting tidbit from the Freedom Hosting case. The US&#039;s entire extradition argument lies on the fact that the guy used a &#039;US IP address&quot; to access the main server and generate reseller free accounts for Tor users. I believe that would be a Tor exit node. Might want to edit torrc to prevent any US nodes/relays for however you do maintenance of SR and anything else you are engaged in. Stay safe and crank up the paranoia you will need it, if the site get&#039;s exploited and somebody magically appears to help you fix it at exactly the right time: it&#039;s the fedz

				I just realized that the print edition, with about a million units published, jesus... the extent of how far and widely publicized this article will be. :o<br />Everyone who is anyone reads Forbes. From Obama to Bono to your neighborhood highschool principal. I think if anyone was living under a rock and hadn&#039;t heard about Silk Road or DPR.. that rock will be gone in a couple weeks.<br />I predict the BTC rate is going to very certainly skyrocket.. and that&#039;s not just because of crusty old men reading the article and deciding they want to buy bitcoins to buy drugs (although that&#039;s going to happen too). Just the fact that &quot;bitcoin&quot; is going to go from a term you read about somehwere online to a household, kitchen table word..<br /><br />Exciting times indeed. If there was ever a time to buy BTC.. it&#039;s now. Like yesterday.

In the last few months there have been plenty of articles about Bitcoin, despite the fact that Bitcoin is far more difficult to understand and far less interesting to the layperson than the story of SR. (Sure, many of those Bitcoin articles briefly mention SR, but few let onto the fact that it was Silk Road more than anything else that proved Bitcoin to be a viable currency.)

				yes, but in one way or another, they have their workers to do so. Pablo Escobar was not selling drugs himself, i understand what you mean.

				Nice read DPR!<br />Interesting to read you like a nice joint of sticky buds.. Do you use any other drugs? MDMA, LSD etc..?<br /><br />Also cool to know that the original owner isn&#039;t you. I find it so mind blowing how this website can be passed on just like that, without even the users or LE realizing until now. I wonder if the original owner still lurks the forums. <br />I love the idea of revealing your actual identity when you pass away, the funeral would be something else. <br />SR reminds me that there is still hope for this society. +1

				But it just goes to show, it is extremely public and is thriving.&nbsp; There is power in numbers and I believe it will only continue to get more secure as it continues to grow.<br /><br />DPR seems more like a human being than ever before! Which is pretty cool. Very excited to see how this publication will affect the future of the road both short and long term.

Thank you.<br /><br />You know, I was reading back over my post, and I realized I hadn&#039;t said a single thing about the interview. Then I read your reply, not knowing it was there after I hit refresh.<br /><br />In regards to the interview: Journalism has always had its personnel that personify what we believe in, even if at heart they may not - or, actively avoid and do not. I think we owe it to the various reporters that have taken the objective view on our community. This interview most of all, demonstrates that fact. <br /><br />A few quotes on Journalism:<br /><br />&quot;In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government&#039;s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the public. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. &quot; - Hugo L Black, a Justice during the case Nixon brought against the New York Times in printing the Pentagon Papers<br /><br />&quot;Great is journalism. Is not every able editor a ruler of the world, being the persuader of it?&quot; Thomas Carlyle, on the French Revolution.<br /><br />&quot;I suppose, in the end, we journalists try - or should try - to be the first impartial witnesses of history. If we have any reason for our existence, the least must be our ability to report history as it happens so that no one can say: &#039;We didn&#039;t know - no one told us.&#039; &quot; - Robert Fisk, &quot;The Great War for Civilization: The Conquest of The Middle East&quot;<br /><br />And this one, while not necessarily absolutely about journalism, I found while reading wikiquote to confirm the quote from Carlyle.<br /><br />&quot;One&#039;s right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.&quot; Robert H. Jackson, a justice on the supreme court during the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette hearing that protected students from being forced to salute, and pledge allegiance, to the American flag.<br /><br />The interview itself, was as I expected it to be. It is, as it would be said, as it should be. It is definitely to turn heads when it is read, and it will demonstrate that we are here. We are not going anywhere. If that doesn&#039;t scare someone, it should.<br /><br />That being said, I see a lot of BTC speculation in regards to this. While the Forbes article will generate views, hits, and research into the subject - and purely by work of numbers an increase in sales is inevitable due to this... I don&#039;t think it will have all that great of an effect on bitcoin. Especially not to the end that everyone wants to believe. Bitcoin used to fluctuate like that, but, by weight alone it is too heavy to average out in such a manner as an order of magnitude or even a 50% increase in 24 hours. At the end of the day, Forbes readers are still the same investors that are scared of us. They don&#039;t hire us, consider us intelligent, or see us as equals.<br /><br />And besides, every investor in the US has to deal with the SEC enough as it is, and worldwide there are regulations and regulators all over the place that would just love to slap some kind of levy. Until the heat dies down on the subpoenas and the US learns what cryptocurrency actually means, they can&#039;t touch it with anything more than their hidden securities, and trust me:<br /><br />They&#039;re already doing that, and they have been for some time now.

				I got it!!!!<br /><br />Found it today at a Target. The issue isn&#039;t what I expected from what Forbes indicated its Sept 2nd would look like. The cover is a huge gold asterisk with a dollar sign in the middle and text that reads &quot;Highway To Wealth&quot;<br /><br />The interview is on page 132. The issue has a ton of opposing ideas, dealing doubly with the NSA privacy issues, and our free responses to the tyranny.<br /><br />Beyond our own its actually a pretty good divergence from the normal Forbes reading.<br /><br />Edit: After getting home and starting to read, this is actually a bit more interesting. I don&#039;t know if there is just a secondary article accompanying a special issue that was released early, but, this article isn&#039;t so much an interview as an actual ARTICLE. Greenberg offers a lot of commentary, and only quotes DPR inline.<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t noticed this earlier either, but this issue is actually labeled a special issue. It&#039;s got the markings on it that it should be &quot;Displayed until November 11, 2013.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m only a paragraph or so in.

				Finished the article. You know, it&#039;s actually a really good article. It&#039;s interesting. You can almost see that Andy himself may disagree with everything, but the objective side of him swings the other way. On one side he&#039;s trying to really emphasize the fact that we sell harmful things, while trying very hard to also make sure the point: we sell things that CAN be harmful, if used wrongfully, because it is our freedom to take that risk.<br /><br />He mentions Atlantis a little more, but it is in a very negative light. He almost makes them seem petty, as though they&#039;re cocky and egotistical, almost the bill gates &amp; microsoft to our steve jobs &amp; apple. Where he refers to DPR as our founder and &quot;captain&quot; he refers to Atlantis instead as a standard corporate entity. Vladimir is the CEO, Heisenberg is a trusty minion and &quot;founder,&quot; its all very obviously in a negative note.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be keeping an eye out for people reading it and see if i can&#039;t pick up on what is said. I know that I saw the online article floating around some mailing lists and the discussions are interesting. Most of it appears positive, with some background noise questions like &quot;Can I block TOR on my home router and prevent my kids from getting to this place?&quot;<br /><br />Interestingly enough, some of the more negative talk I&#039;ve seen actually latches not onto DPR and SR, but onto Atlantis. The outlandish personality and the celebrity persona that they/he has taken on in order to promote, particularly the public methods that are obviously kid facing - and the cartoon, which was obviously engineered to tell kids &quot;You can score this without your parents knowing!&quot; and put on youtube. The same people are somewhat supportive on the opposite side, they&#039;re actually saying in not so many words that its nice the interview is in a more adult publication and not something that would easily catch their teenagers&#039; eyes.<br /><br />Back to the article though. There are some very interesting FAVORABLE points in the article about the concept though. For example:<br /><br />&quot;Silk Road doesn&#039;t really sell drugs. It sells insurance and financial products,&quot; says Carnegie Mellon economics professor Nicolas Christin. &quot;It doesn&#039;t really matter whether you&#039;re selling T-shirts or cocaine. The business model is to commoditize security.&quot;<br /><br />He also mentions some of our discussions, including DPR&#039;s book clubs. He also mentions how we view SR and DPR, mentioning the creation of jobs and the like.<br /><br />In a funny piece, he does mention how DPR stuck to the very specific cryptic methods of interaction, while Atlantis chose to use Cryptocat. He also mentions how days after their conversation over Cryptocat, it was determined that a bug exists that could expose and decrypt the discussion.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, and I know this will disappoint some, no mention of the .onion url or the silkroadurl website is present in this article.

				Hi all, and perhaps a lil info from DPR would be interesting here..<br /><br />Just re-read the Forbes article, and I was struck by it&#039;s USA-centric slant. According to paragraph 4, the goods go out in the &#039;U.S. Postal Service, right under the federal government&#039;s nose.&#039; Kinda makes it seem like the whole SR trade is originating in, and entirely taking place in, the U.S. Only very late in the article is there a single mention of non-U.S. vendors (Australian).<br /><br />Only SR might know the figures, but an awful lot of trade is international, or within other countries internally, having little or nothing to do with the U.S. I think this is one aspect of SR that makes it what it is - I can order domestically in my country, or from overseas, as I decide, and I don&#039;t live under a federal government.<br /><br />DPR - is it just Greenberg&#039;s spin on it to paint SR as an entirely U.S. phenomenon?

				Hi missbliss,<br /><br />Ta for that, but I still think the article makes nothing of the international side. Lots of stuff surely coming out it&#039;s traditional brewing grounds in the Netherlands and Germany (know I have bought from these places).<br /><br />Guess what is bothering me is that it seems to weaken the importance of what SR is achieving, as though just a tightening down on U.S. postal systems and state laws etc would somehow constrain SR, as though it is CONTAINABLE (within borders, for example). And that&#039;s not it at all.<br /><br />It was still a decent article. And I would still like to hear DPR&#039;s thoughts.<br /><br />Take care

Forbes is an American publication, and it is directed at the American mid-upper and upper class. To bring into account worldwide figures, would have required worldwide contribution. This is a magazine that largely tries to report specifically on what it can... and Greenberg spent a good amount of time dealing with its US component. If he had say, gone to England and tried to get some through the post, that&#039;d be something to add to the article... but he didn&#039;t. He stuck to what he knew and what he had experienced. <br /><br />Frankly, since I&#039;ve never dealt with anything but mail in the US and Canada, I have no idea what/who/how mail is handled or behaves outside of my home base. I know Australia has become tight on its restrictions, I know that Europe has some things we don&#039;t and has shit of some things we have amazing. That is the extent. I&#039;m sure if I researched, and I&#039;m sure if Greenberg researched, I could come up with a pretty good amount of information... but I don&#039;t think many of his readers would have found value in it.<br /><br />I think to a certain extent, since the article is distributed here on our forums in a global manner, that the opinion will sway towards angst against the US centric opinion... but, at the same time, if DPR hadn&#039;t posted it, it&#039;d only be the US who would have found out for the most part.

				Slightly off topic, but maybe not. It just occurred to me that I was reading about the UNABOMBER the other day. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s common knowledge to most of you, but it was all new to me -&nbsp; being a bit naive.<br /><br />He was discovered because of his strong feelings and opinions - his atypical moral perspective was recognized by his sister-in-law and then his brother (her husband).<br /><br />DPR: I was as enthusiastic and agreeable of your moral perspective and leadership, and envious (and proud) of your ability to communicate it so effectively, as I am of the likes of Linus Torvalds, Eric S Raymond, and Richard Stallman in the world of computer software freedom.<br /><br />I do worry though that the individuality and rarity - the uniqueness, of your public words, could lead to somebody realizing a link between you in the real world and the entity that is DPR.<br /><br />You know, it&#039;s like an artist. Somebody can recognize a painting as being in a particular artist&#039;s style. Your words are your art and could be recognized.<br /><br />Thinking about it more though, they would have to publish your Forbe&#039;s interview on the daily evening news, and every layman would have to read it. I suppose the layman isn&#039;t interested in Silk Road and Bitcoins in the slightest. Your friends/family probably won&#039;t see the Forbes article. ?<br /><br />Still, be careful. I get the impression that you are much smarter than me anyway so I&#039;m sure you/yous have it covered ;)<br /><br />Does it sound like I have overdone the cocaine tonight? :D

				The use of .to should be discouraged at every opportunity, those using it are either incredibly naive about the risks they are taking or in the one isolated case of our resident journo you really have no need to remain anonymous, glad to see you considered the private messages issue though.
