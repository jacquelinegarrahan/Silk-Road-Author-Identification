				mate this is a different world to pretty much anything you&#039;ve experienced. it&#039;s still going strong because we do it right.<br /><br />theres shit loads of info in the security section, i suggest you have a browse through there - it will tell you anything you want to know about bitcoins, staying anonymous and a lot more
