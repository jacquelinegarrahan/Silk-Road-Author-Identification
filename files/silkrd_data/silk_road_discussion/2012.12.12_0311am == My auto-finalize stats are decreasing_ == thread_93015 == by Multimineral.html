				So when I made my first purchase on SR, I didn&#039;t really understand what auto-finalize meant and my first order did just that because I didn&#039;t know what I was doing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had that one glaring flaw in my stats since then but it looks like it is decreasing somehow over time.&nbsp; Edit:&nbsp; Maybe I didn&#039;t make this question clear enough.&nbsp; The auto-finalize percent obviously decreases with more successful transactions, but mine is not decreasing normally.&nbsp; I have 1/10 auto-finalized transactions, but a 5.12% rate.&nbsp; Intuitively, I would expect a 10% rate.<br /><br />My current stats:<br />Total transactions: 10<br />Total spent: $874.4<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 5.12%<br />Member for: 5 months<br /><br />5.12 percent?&nbsp; How is that possible?&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s weighted by the price of the order that was auto-finalized?

				Well...<br /><br />Say you have spent 50 dollars, then you accidentally let another 50 dollar transaction autofinalize. Your autofinalize rate would be 50%. <br /><br />So say then you spend another 50 dollars and finalize in a timely matter, your autofinalize rate would then be 33%.<br /><br />Catching on????

				For example;<br /><br />You have 10 transactions and 2 of which auto finalized which is 20% auto finalize.<br /><br />You make another 10 transactions of which none auto finalized meaning your AF percentage would drop to 10%.<br /><br />Dank

I had a guy with very few semi-expensive transactions take a loan from me via the contract listing.

				I&#039;m pretty sure the decrease in your auto-finalize % is weighted on the amount (BTCvalue amount) you spend AFTER the auto-finalize purchase.

				Thanks guys.&nbsp; So if it is weighted on time, will the stat ever reach zero after a long time?&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see my stupid mistake disappear completely.
