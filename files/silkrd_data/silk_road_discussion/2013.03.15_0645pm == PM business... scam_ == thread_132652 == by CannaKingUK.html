				It&#039;s difficult because since they don&#039;t have any forum posts, they&#039;re harder to find.&nbsp; If you post their usernames here, I will look into it.&nbsp; I deleted a few of those accounts last night, but unfortunately even after deletion, they can simply re-register the same username again (or a different one) and continue forth with their scam.<br /><br />One way to prevent these messages is to change your forum preferences so that they are set NOT to show when you are online.

				Got the same message too from two different accounts.<br />I replied to try and string them along saying I am very interested.. I might make up a fake escrow service and say to them they must front a small amount of coin before I pay for the goods just to prove the deal is legit or something.

				I got this message too, fking scammers. <br /><br />Also whats up with everyone&#039;s avatars surrounded by the anonymous mask image? <br /><br />Obviouly we understand everything cant ever be perfect but a few Bitcoin invested by the owners of SR to control the spam here, create a proper search engine, introduce other currency conversions and stuff like this wouldnt do any harm me thinks..

				I think that we should rig the forums so that everyone gets the cocaine email 24 hours after signing up.<br /><br />On the basis that anyone who contacts that person is so laughably naive that they&#039;re a risk to the security of the entire SR operation and they can be weeded out on that basis.
