				How dose everyone go about capping 2cb, I used to use a set of mg scales but the substance tends to clump and some always ends up stuck to the scales. Is there an easier and quicker way to do it, any input appreciated.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />L

				If there is I have yet to find it.. I know a buddy used to dissolve his 2c-i in a solution then in a nasal spray bottle, not as useful for selling in small quantities though I guess. I usually just struggle though the tedium.. I too would be ecstatic over a good alternative.

				Okay I have a lot of experience capping drugs of all types, and here&#039;s how I do it:<br /><br />First thing to remember when measuring anything, the two most important things are accuracy (how close your measurement is to the actual value) and precision (how repeatable the result is). Accuracy can be taken care of, first of all, by calibrating your scale correctly. I do this every single time I use my scale. After the scale is calibrated, depending on the model of scale you use, put the weighing tray in place and tare it. Another thing about scales, especially when using a cheaper milligram scale, I&#039;ve noticed that they are less accurate when weighing small amounts. I like to use the larger half of the cap to weigh my drugs in to take care of this problem, since it adds about 60 mg to the total weight.<br /><br />For precise measurements, I start with weighing the larger half of the cap about three times. If you get a difference of over about 3 mg from the average of these three weights with each measurement, either your scale is crap or you are making a mistake, like dropping the capsule on the tray, pushing down on the scale when you put the cap on the tray, breathing on the scale, etc. So what I do is make sure the scale is at 0.000 before you weigh anything, sometimes turning the scale on and waiting a minute or so to let it warm up helps too. Then instead of making contact with the scale before letting go of the cap, hold it as close as you can to the tray and drop it. After weighing the capsule three times and getting similar results each time (I&#039;d say no more than +/- 2 mg from the average of the three) you can move on.<br /><br />Okay, let&#039;s say your results for the capsule were 65, 66, and 66 mg. From these results, I would say the capsule weighs 66 mg. Don&#039;t worry about getting the EXACT average (something like 65.67mg) since your scale can&#039;t weigh smaller amounts than mg. So the cap weighs 66 mg and you want 25 mg. Use a small scoop or knife if you don&#039;t have something small enough to put inside the capsule and scoop your 2C-B into the capsule. When you think you&#039;re close to the desired weight, weigh the capsule with 2C-B three times again and take an average. Once you get three very close results and a close to average total weight of about 91 mg (66+25=91) you&#039;re done. Put the other half of the cap on and it&#039;s ready to go!<br /><br />To simplify:<br />1. Calibrate your scale<br />2. Measure the capsule (multiple times and take an average).<br />3. Put 2C-B in and measure (again, more than once and take an average).<br />4. Take the total weight of the capsule with 2C-B and subtract the weight of the empty capsule.<br />5. If the result isn&#039;t the amount you want, add or remove 2C-B as required and repeat steps 3 and 4. If the weight is right you&#039;re done.<br /><br />As with everything else, you get faster and better at this with practice. Take your time and remember, ACCURACY and PRECISION!!! Either way I&#039;m happy to hear you&#039;re actually weighing out your drugs. Hope this helps!

				I forgot to add, this isn&#039;t necessarily a quick method, but when weighing out super potent drugs quick DEFINITELY isn&#039;t safe. However, this is an accurate method, and you only get residue on the inside of the capsule (which is going to be used anyways) and a small amount on whatever tool you use to put the drug in the capsule.<br /><br />I have seen scales measure things at sometimes 10 mg under (even more) on the first weigh, especially if the small mass of power is the only thing on the scale. This can be very dangerous when the drug being weighed is as potent as a 2C-X chemical.<br /><br />So yea, my method isn&#039;t really faster, but it is more accurate and you don&#039;t end up with a big mess and wasted drugs.

				I place a small piece of parchment paper on the scale. Then tare the scale and weigh your product. Most things don&#039;t stick to the parchment paper :)
