				I&#039;m wondering what the effect of the article was and how it is effecting demand on the Silk Road. Has there been a surge in membership or a surge in Vendorship?<br /><br />Forbes target readership isn&#039;t necessarily chronic hashish smokers or cocaine dealers, but there had to be some noticeable effect. <br /><br /><br />

				No offense, but my 60 year old mother brought up the road to me 2 years ago (she doesn&#039;t do any drugs, never has) because it was all over the media and has been since it started. Pretty much EVERYONE has heard of it, they just think it is to complicated to get on here and get coins....Maybe the Forbes articles well attract a shit load of millionaire business men that have secret habits as Forbes is really an upper class businesss magazine, thats why I am so happy to see the interview there! It will def bring us more business but it just came out and I haven&#039;t noticed much of a change and doubt we will really....It won&#039;t be a big enough change to notice.
