				&nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />I understand that scammers may enter community but if its this high it makes the prices go up on SR...<br /><br />Couldnt there be a &quot;judgement day&quot; say after 30 days the Owners of the site view all the reviews and decide to kick u off or keep you on ...<br /><br /><br />I would love to be a seller but at that price i would have to increase pricing and not sure if the community would be interested in my product at that price.

				That fee is refundable after 6 weeks + $1500 transactions and good feedback. So, it&#039;s just an incentive to deter scammers and promote good vending.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a big high but it does what it&#039;s supposed to do.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have that kind of money, Atlantis market has a much lower entry cost at $25, you can try your hand there and see how it goes.

				i originally looked into SR for vending purposes, but it didn&#039;t meet my needs, as i only have a one time supply of pharms to unload. the fee is a bit high, but if you plan on being around for awhile, it&#039;s totally worth it. and as nyancats said, that new place is only $25. i don&#039;t trust it, though. I&#039;m not saying you can put a price on trust, but if you could, i&#039;d buy $500 trust ;)

				I like the fee and I wish it would be double actually.&nbsp; It truly filters out the pranksters, scammers, and unloaders or shall I say &quot;free loaders&quot; on the website.&nbsp; If you are willing to put up at least $500 to start your biz on SR, then you have to maintain a certain level of professionalism.<br /><br />

				It should be $1000...then $500 of your first 1k then 500 of your second 1k ...for a total of 2500 at least!!<br /><br />We need real vendors that are hear to make money and not scam...not some kid that just bought 100 E pills form someone one on here and wants to flip them...or some other person that buys on here form Europe then rips people in the USA by selling that shit at a jacked up rate.....<br /><br /><br />We also do not need vendors that IRL do not have 500!!! I understand that everyone has to start somewhere...it just should not be SR...<br /><br />When you let people vend that are not properly stocked or bankrolled...that leads to them doing dirty shit. PERIOD.<br /><br />What even worse is &quot; vendors&quot; with no hookups or outs and are trying to buy &quot;bulk&quot; on here to resell...That simply is not good for the road...as they are not vendors...they are hustlers...I give them that...but they are not people you would want to count on and do business with. Yes there is a place for small vendors... and it would be cool if you could let the small guys in with a cap...such as they can not vend an item over $25...they can never FE.....that would be a way..for a small time guy to manage to grow and get bigger and learn the right way...they could be vendors..that only sold grams for instance...as there are&nbsp; a lot of buyers with limited funds too...and a lot of the big vendors simply can not help them... So something like that would help everyone... And I think would be an asset to the community....<br />

Maybe to you $2500 is shit as an established vendor, but to us new vendors it&#039;s a show-stopper. Not only we have to worry about the uncertainty, the learning curve, do competitive pricing, play the Bitcoin roller coaster game, and slowly ramp up the volume to get profitable, you also want the fee to be $2500? <br /><br />You&#039;re fucking nuts :D

				Dude, you can get a refund and anyways, if you are good at what you&#039;re doing, you won&#039;t even bother to ask the admin for a refund since you can make a couple of thousands a day...Seriously, 500$ isn&#039;t that much of an obstacle for anyone being serious enough!
