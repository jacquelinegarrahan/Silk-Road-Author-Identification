			<dd class="postbody">
				So how can I get onto SR with my Android phone? I have a rooted/flashed Samsung Infuse 4G.<br /><br />I installed Orbot onto it, but whenever I do the tor check or try to access an onion site it fails. It says I am not connected to tor or the site doesn&#039;t load.<br /><br />Is there any settings I am missing? Hopefully somebody can help me and find out what I am doing wrong.<br /><br />Thanks<br />-Pilot

				Key out of Orweb (I assume that&#039;s what you&#039;re using?) - just back back back key until it closes.<br />Restart Orbot<br />Restart Orweb<br /><br />Sometimes it doesn&#039;t pick up first time, just keep trying and it should work. It did for me, at least.<br /><br />Be warned though - Orweb holds cookies in your phone by default. E.g. SR login - it skips right to the homepage with you logged in. Be careful.

				Yea, gotta use Orweb after you load up Orbot. I&#039;ve got Silk Road bookmarked, but every time I open it, I have to edit the address and remove the https:// so that it is just silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ or it will not load either.

				My problem is the damn security image when I try to log in... I installed Orbot and Orweb on my Droid phone, hoping to be able to check SR when I&#039;m not at home. But that verification image will not show up. I can enter my name and password, but I have no way of reading what&#039;s in the security image<br /><br />This happening to anyone else? Got a workaround?

				Is accessing SR this way through your phone just as safe and anonymous as accessing on your computer?<br /><br />

				Just as an FYI you don&#039;t HAVE to use orweb to browse via TOR. It is possible through firefox mobile with proxymob addon as well as opera mobile with correct proxy settings. Both of these have much more functionality than orweb.
