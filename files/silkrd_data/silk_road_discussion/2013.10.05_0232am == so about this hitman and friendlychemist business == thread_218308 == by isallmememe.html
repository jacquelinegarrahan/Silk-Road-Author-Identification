				they never found any indication a murder actually took place. did they actually find who this friendlychemist guy was irl? did they find this redandwhite dude?<br /><br />what if dpr suspected the feds were getting onto him and the whole friendlychemist hitman thing was just a hoax to draw out the feds, force them to play their hand to see if they really were inside the sr or not. its a very possible scenario and would certainly explain why no evidence was found of any murder actually taking place.

				There was a cocaine vendor on here called &quot;Nob&quot; (not to be confused with nod). My intuition told me he was LE from the beginning. Apparently DPR was brokering a cocaine deal with someone, I believe this someone was nob. Nob claimed he knew DPR personally and they were doing a deal together. He was also selling kilo quantities of cocaine on SR on a new account. Then on the vendor forum, a guy name googleyed1 claimed he not only got ripped off by Nob but much worse. Nob did his deals by storing the &quot;product&quot; in a self storage unit whereby the buyer had to go pick it up.

DPR contacted googleyed1 and gave him BTC to buy the coke and receive it at his house. Nob who was an undercover LE, sent the &quot;coke&quot;, a controlled delivery was done and googleyed1 was busted. DPR thought googleyed1 was going to talk to LE so he hired nob to have him killed. Nob sent him fake photos of the killing and got paid the balance.

				can&#039;t see dpr getting that involved in a coke deal either. the man was getting 10% of everything sold on the road ffs. why would he risk getting his hands dirty like that? ..i know i fucking wouldn&#039;t. the best would be a message to one of the sr top vendors asking him to take &#039;special&#039; care of my man here. that would be as far as i&#039;d get involved, even for a mate.

				maybe it was like in that movie, i can&#039;t remember the name atm, but the character says to the crazy hitman guy &#039;can you take care of my friend here&#039;. the crazy hitman says sure and pulls out a gun and immediately blows his head off. the first character goes nuts and says &#039;wtf did you do? i said &#039;take care of him&#039;, not &#039;take care of him&#039;, for fuck sake.<br /><br />maybe it was all just a big misunderstanding, a lost in translation kinda thing.

				was googleyed1 a vendor AND an administrator then?<br /><br />If a forum mod was believed to have been stealing bitcoin, and then they got busted... Wouldn&#039;t people notice a mod disappearing? Why do we not know who the mod referenced in the complaint is?<br /><br />The timing of the missing bitcoin and the coke deal seems weird to me. DPR was facilitating a deal in some way with a vendor and/or admin (perhaps the same person?) and then DPR realises this person has stolen bitcoins, but just as he realises that (by complete chance in terms of timing) this admin/vendor gets arrested? Like, right at the same time?<br /><br />Someone tell me if I&#039;m off a wild one here, because I&#039;ve not seen anybody talk about this point. And DPR *did* try and get the hit done by the same person who had initiated this deal, whether that was nob or not. A stupid decision, for sure, but I would guess that the person who sent the coke to the admin is the only person dpr knew who knew the address of the admin...

				You guys need to understand there was 2 hits placed....<br /><br />First one was on an admin that was done by an undercover. That was the 80, 000 one. <br /><br />Second one was on the blackmailer, was not done by an undercover but according to Canadian police DPR was scammed as they ahve no evidence of such a murder taking place

				This is how it really went down:<br /><br />Flush was an admin at one point.<br /><br />Midwestmedical wrties:<br />I checked his post history and he claims to have been a vendor at one point and clearly had roundtable access. <br /><br />Here is his &quot;profile&quot; last seen Jan 26 2013, about 2 weeks before this thread started.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=40436<br /><br />So Nob contacted DPR, and DPR told nob to talk to flush.&nbsp; Flush does a deal with nob possibly, or flush tells googleyed1 to do a deal with nob.&nbsp; Could it have been flush in maryland who stole from DPR and SR before going rouge and losing his job.&nbsp; Next DPR paid nob the 80k to kill flush? <br /><br />I wonder if DPR realized his mistake as time when on and more people reported problems with nob.

This guy &quot;Phoboss&quot; made an order for our #4 H, which incidentally has been very popular since we introduced it recently. Please take a look at the feedback here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3b4405eae7<br /><br />Before it even arrived, we received 3 or 4 long rambling messages complaining that it was not there within 24 hours. Even after we informed him that it had been shipped already, Royal Mail, untracked, he still kept hassling us for updates. Clearly that was not possible, because it was untracked, but that doesn&#039;t seem to hinder this guy. Incidentally, it arrived within 3 business days, and took about 36 hours processing. We have a lot of orders to get through, and despite what people seem to think a 1st class stamp does not get an envelope to you overnight.<br /><br />Anyway, when it finally did arrive, he sent a very abusive message complaining that this white powder was definitely not heroin. Clearly he was expecting #3 heroin, diamorphine freebase, which is the most common in the UK, and is brown in appearance. Our product is #4 heroin, dimorphine HCL, and is white in appearance. I would advise Phoboss to take a look at google.com some time and check this information before flying off on one and saying he has been ripped. He obviously didn&#039;t, and now looks rather silly.<br /><br />So, he wrote us a lot of long, unpunctuated, hate mail, with inappropriate use of CAPS LOCK in most of his particularly impolite sentences, including death threats, and threatening to &quot;shut us down&quot;. As you all well know, Googleyed does not respond well to this shit, especially the poor spelling, grammar, punctuation, and the dreaded CAPS LOCK!<br /><br />Some particularly irritating statements:<br /><br />&quot;DO NOT MAKE ME WAIT FOR RESOLUTION BULL SHIT OK SORT THIS NOW BEFORE I HIT THE FORUMS TRUST ME THIS IS NOT A FRETT IT&#039;S A PROMISE YOU IDOOT&quot;<br /><br />Well, it certainly is not a &quot;frett&quot;, whatever that might be! This line led GE to believe that the customer Phoboss might still be in his teens. Thus the immature nature with which he has dealt with this matter. And this was before we even replied to him! Guy really does not know how to deal with people correctly.<br /><br />&quot;ARE YOU A CUNT REIMBURSE ME YOU BASTARD OR NAME A PLACE AND I&#039;LL GLADLY COME SEE YOU OK CUNT&quot;<br /><br />Using &quot;cunt&quot; twice in the same sentence. Wonderfully wide vocabulary you possess there kid. And you want to come see GE? Now, we have been reprimanded before for this kind of thing, so we are not gonna get sucked into going down this road, however very very tempting it is.<br /><br />Now at this point, we have told Phoboss that he needs to calm down, and stop the abuse, or we are not gonna discuss this matter at all. But no, we get another few long rambling abusive messages, threatening us, demanding a full refund or he is gonna get his friends and fuck us up, topped off with:<br /><br />&quot;Your finished satan spawn liar dangerous devil WATCH THIS YOU THIEF SCAMMING BASTARD&quot;<br /><br />And then he comes to the forums and starts gunning us here too..<br /><br />Essentially, all you need to do is ask yourself this question; Would you take the time out of your busy day to deal with this complete asshole? I think I can answer that for everyone actually. NO. So, Googleyed has told Phoboss &quot;We have absolutely no interest in talking to you.&quot; And that is where this ends. The SR team can take it from here.<br /><br />And just to address a couple of statements he made in his OP:<br /><br />If it was processing for 15 days... Why did he not cancel the order?? You can cancel after 4 days. So that is clearly bullshit!<br /><br />Every other feedback is a complaint? Well, we have been going for nearly 2 years, and have one of the best reputations on the road. Our stats speak for themselves. And I invite, and even encourage, everyone to take a look at our feedback, epic stats, and try out our service with its excelling customer care.<br /><br />India from Pakistan? Firstly, racial agro? Not here bro. Take it elsewhere! And incidentally, when has anyone ever met an Indian.. From Pakistan.. ??? That would be a Pakistani, you ill-educated piece of human excrement! Shut your mouth, you adolescent junkie reprobate!<br /><br />Also, I invite everyone to look at Phoboss&#039;s stats and posts here on the forums, and decide for yourself whether he is either really unlucky and gets scammed every five minutes, or whether he is just the kind of asshole that screams &quot;scammer, scammer!&quot; every five minutes hoping to get a free handout when he is getting WDs. Well, not from GE!!<br /><br />Ok guys. Rant over. I think I have taken this douche to pieces quite enough for today..<br /><br />Kind regards to all, Googleyed<br /><br />And remember kids... Don&#039;t do drugs!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />...and was also last active just a few days ago<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=7743

My intuition told me he was LE from the beginning. Apparently DPR was brokering a cocaine deal with someone, I believe this someone was nob. Nob claimed he knew DPR personally and they were doing a deal together. He was also selling kilo quantities of cocaine on SR on a new account. Then on the vendor forum, a guy name googleyed1 claimed he not only got ripped off by Nob but much worse. Nob did his deals by storing the &quot;product&quot; in a self storage unit whereby the buyer had to go pick it up.

DPR contacted googleyed1 and gave him BTC to buy the coke and receive it at his house. Nob who was an undercover LE, sent the &quot;coke&quot;, a controlled delivery was done and googleyed1 was busted. DPR thought googleyed1 was going to talk to LE so he hired nob to have him killed.

This guy &quot;Phoboss&quot; made an order for our #4 H, which incidentally has been very popular since we introduced it recently. Please take a look at the feedback here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3b4405eae7<br /><br />Before it even arrived, we received 3 or 4 long rambling messages complaining that it was not there within 24 hours. Even after we informed him that it had been shipped already, Royal Mail, untracked, he still kept hassling us for updates. Clearly that was not possible, because it was untracked, but that doesn&#039;t seem to hinder this guy. Incidentally, it arrived within 3 business days, and took about 36 hours processing. We have a lot of orders to get through, and despite what people seem to think a 1st class stamp does not get an envelope to you overnight.<br /><br />Anyway, when it finally did arrive, he sent a very abusive message complaining that this white powder was definitely not heroin. Clearly he was expecting #3 heroin, diamorphine freebase, which is the most common in the UK, and is brown in appearance. Our product is #4 heroin, dimorphine HCL, and is white in appearance. I would advise Phoboss to take a look at google.com some time and check this information before flying off on one and saying he has been ripped. He obviously didn&#039;t, and now looks rather silly.<br /><br />So, he wrote us a lot of long, unpunctuated, hate mail, with inappropriate use of CAPS LOCK in most of his particularly impolite sentences, including death threats, and threatening to &quot;shut us down&quot;. As you all well know, Googleyed does not respond well to this shit, especially the poor spelling, grammar, punctuation, and the dreaded CAPS LOCK!<br /><br />Some particularly irritating statements:<br /><br />&quot;DO NOT MAKE ME WAIT FOR RESOLUTION BULL SHIT OK SORT THIS NOW BEFORE I HIT THE FORUMS TRUST ME THIS IS NOT A FRETT IT&#039;S A PROMISE YOU IDOOT&quot;<br /><br />Well, it certainly is not a &quot;frett&quot;, whatever that might be! This line led GE to believe that the customer Phoboss might still be in his teens. Thus the immature nature with which he has dealt with this matter. And this was before we even replied to him! Guy really does not know how to deal with people correctly.<br /><br />&quot;ARE YOU A CUNT REIMBURSE ME YOU BASTARD OR NAME A PLACE AND I&#039;LL GLADLY COME SEE YOU OK CUNT&quot;<br /><br />Using &quot;cunt&quot; twice in the same sentence. Wonderfully wide vocabulary you possess there kid. And you want to come see GE? Now, we have been reprimanded before for this kind of thing, so we are not gonna get sucked into going down this road, however very very tempting it is.<br /><br />Now at this point, we have told Phoboss that he needs to calm down, and stop the abuse, or we are not gonna discuss this matter at all. But no, we get another few long rambling abusive messages, threatening us, demanding a full refund or he is gonna get his friends and fuck us up, topped off with:<br /><br />&quot;Your finished satan spawn liar dangerous devil WATCH THIS YOU THIEF SCAMMING BASTARD&quot;<br /><br />And then he comes to the forums and starts gunning us here too..<br /><br />Essentially, all you need to do is ask yourself this question; Would you take the time out of your busy day to deal with this complete asshole? I think I can answer that for everyone actually. NO. So, Googleyed has told Phoboss &quot;We have absolutely no interest in talking to you.&quot; And that is where this ends. The SR team can take it from here.<br /><br />And just to address a couple of statements he made in his OP:<br /><br />If it was processing for 15 days... Why did he not cancel the order?? You can cancel after 4 days. So that is clearly bullshit!<br /><br />Every other feedback is a complaint? Well, we have been going for nearly 2 years, and have one of the best reputations on the road. Our stats speak for themselves.

Not here bro. Take it elsewhere! And incidentally, when has anyone ever met an Indian.. From Pakistan.. ??? That would be a Pakistani, you ill-educated piece of human excrement! Shut your mouth, you adolescent junkie reprobate!<br /><br />Also, I invite everyone to look at Phoboss&#039;s stats and posts here on the forums, and decide for yourself whether he is either really unlucky and gets scammed every five minutes, or whether he is just the kind of asshole that screams &quot;scammer, scammer!&quot; every five minutes hoping to get a free handout when he is getting WDs. Well, not from GE!!<br /><br />Ok guys. Rant over. I think I have taken this douche to pieces quite enough for today..<br /><br />Kind regards to all, Googleyed<br /><br />And remember kids...

				I really can&#039;t say much about the coke deal and DPR facilitating that situation. That seems odd, unless he really thought there was a lack of reliable vendors and high quality products on the site, and felt obligated to give the site a little push... I don&#039;t see why he would be lured/attracted into an actual drug deal when he had a whole underground network of online drug dealers to run. <br /><br />As for the whole murder for hire thing, well that is a tough one. It certainly will be the real nail in his coffin so to speak when he gets prosecuted. Between all the &quot;kingpin&quot; bullshit and mandatory minimums he&#039;ll be negotiating, he more than likely doesn&#039;t stand a chance in hell of ever getting out of prison. Sans a presidential pardon or something like that (an acquittal/mistrial maybe !!! that would be great for the guy, but not likely). <br /><br />I know that murder is wrong. But I can&#039;t say if I was in DPR&#039;s shoes, I wouldn&#039;t of seriously contemplated wanting to put hits out a former employee and potential rat, and also the other extortioner. I just probably would have gone about it another way. Not soliciting some unknown entity that supposedly was after a half a million drug debt from this FriendlyChemist individual, but then would immediately settle for a small amount ($160,000) of the supposed debt to be returned to them via a payment for a contract murder that they had to assume the risk of carrying out themselves? Doesn&#039;t seem too advantageous for these suppliers whom were owed the debt. Why not let the whole extortion thing play out and get all your money. Fuck everyone else would be their mantra, people in the drug business at that level are like that. I wonder how much proof FC had shown DPR that scared him enough into making that decision? He must have been scared enough to think it would&#039;ve completely ruined the site&#039;s reputation and user confidence in such.<br /><br />Also DPR had this FriendlyChemist guy&#039;s address apparently, and also knew he had a wife and three kids (that part personally made me mad about him ordering the hit). Assuming this yes, but as would FC&#039;s supplier(s) if he owed them that kind of money. FC&#039;s wife and kids would have already been taken/threatened by the supplier long before DPR would have gotten involved imo.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, if the whole situation with DPR and one of his admins directly facilitating a coke deal was the initial vector of attack/entry by federal investigators, which summarily led to a bust of someone close to DPR that could explain the first &quot;hit&quot; initiated by DPR. Whether it was real or staged.<br /><br />As to his other mistakes... The &#039;altoid&#039; thing, and his initial solicitation, his using his gmail and real name early on while asking for help with hidden sites. Those were made early on in the game, and once things got big, DPR should have been thinking back about how he could at some point have unintentionally linked some form of his identity to SR. <br /><br />He also got sloppy with his patterns of behavior. That would have been obvious to any criminal, but not salient in the mind of a nerd that got sloppy and overconfident in this virtual world that is now more and more merging with real life/identities. Logging into the same cafe IP right near his current residence. Hop on BART or a bike and go somewhere further away at least man, christ. <br /><br />Having the fake IDs sent to his actual place was stupid, why not pay a friend or rent a PO at least. I mean not like everyone on your own damn forum site was giving out that kind of advice on a hourly basis. Why would he personally have to rent the servers, and have his picture at least associated with it, was there literally no other way or anyone else he could trust? <br /><br />And finally, why not leave the country that is most actively hunting you? SF is a great city and a great spot to hide a BTC business/start up/laundry, but why take the risk of staying in the U.S.? There are better, nicer places in the world than SF that would have been way safer for a man like DPR. He obviously had some money in BTC and fiat, he could have lived anywhere he wanted. Moved from swanky hotel room to swanky hotel room under false, or even his real identity. Keep moving, and you don&#039;t get caught. That&#039;s my opinion anyway... <br /><br />I am out a good bit of cash through all this if no emergency backups are released for at least wallets, if not what we also had in escrow, which was my biggest loss. But I am truly sorry for what DPR is going through, and will be going through. I wish there was a way to contact him or write him in prison anonymously to say thank you for the mark you left on my life, society, the internet, and just freedom. <br /><br />You don&#039;t deserve the draconian penalties our joke of a government is going to dole out like it&#039;s just another day of them making the world a worse place. Fuck Obama, Congress, and just about every alphabet agency out there, you do nothing but subvert and steal from the people. Shame on all that participate in that farce. Long Live DPR!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

That seems odd, unless he really thought there was a lack of reliable vendors and high quality products on the site, and felt obligated to give the site a little push... I don&#039;t see why he would be lured/attracted into an actual drug deal when he had a whole underground network of online drug dealers to run. <br /><br />As for the whole murder for hire thing, well that is a tough one. It certainly will be the real nail in his coffin so to speak when he gets prosecuted. Between all the &quot;kingpin&quot; bullshit and mandatory minimums he&#039;ll be negotiating, he more than likely doesn&#039;t stand a chance in hell of ever getting out of prison. Sans a presidential pardon or something like that (an acquittal/mistrial maybe !!! that would be great for the guy, but not likely). <br /><br />I know that murder is wrong. But I can&#039;t say if I was in DPR&#039;s shoes, I wouldn&#039;t of seriously contemplated wanting to put hits out a former employee and potential rat, and also the other extortioner. I just probably would have gone about it another way. Not soliciting some unknown entity that supposedly was after a half a million drug debt from this FriendlyChemist individual, but then would immediately settle for a small amount ($160,000) of the supposed debt to be returned to them via a payment for a contract murder that they had to assume the risk of carrying out themselves? Doesn&#039;t seem too advantageous for these suppliers whom were owed the debt. Why not let the whole extortion thing play out and get all your money. Fuck everyone else would be their mantra, people in the drug business at that level are like that. I wonder how much proof FC had shown DPR that scared him enough into making that decision? He must have been scared enough to think it would&#039;ve completely ruined the site&#039;s reputation and user confidence in such.<br /><br />Also DPR had this FriendlyChemist guy&#039;s address apparently, and also knew he had a wife and three kids (that part personally made me mad about him ordering the hit). Assuming this yes, but as would FC&#039;s supplier(s) if he owed them that kind of money. FC&#039;s wife and kids would have already been taken/threatened by the supplier long before DPR would have gotten involved imo.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, if the whole situation with DPR and one of his admins directly facilitating a coke deal was the initial vector of attack/entry by federal investigators, which summarily led to a bust of someone close to DPR that could explain the first &quot;hit&quot; initiated by DPR. Whether it was real or staged.<br /><br />As to his other mistakes... The &#039;altoid&#039; thing, and his initial solicitation, his using his gmail and real name early on while asking for help with hidden sites. Those were made early on in the game, and once things got big, DPR should have been thinking back about how he could at some point have unintentionally linked some form of his identity to SR. <br /><br />He also got sloppy with his patterns of behavior. That would have been obvious to any criminal, but not salient in the mind of a nerd that got sloppy and overconfident in this virtual world that is now more and more merging with real life/identities. Logging into the same cafe IP right near his current residence. Hop on BART or a bike and go somewhere further away at least man, christ. <br /><br />Having the fake IDs sent to his actual place was stupid, why not pay a friend or rent a PO at least. I mean not like everyone on your own damn forum site was giving out that kind of advice on a hourly basis. Why would he personally have to rent the servers, and have his picture at least associated with it, was there literally no other way or anyone else he could trust? <br /><br />And finally, why not leave the country that is most actively hunting you? SF is a great city and a great spot to hide a BTC business/start up/laundry, but why take the risk of staying in the U.S.? There are better, nicer places in the world than SF that would have been way safer for a man like DPR. He obviously had some money in BTC and fiat, he could have lived anywhere he wanted. Moved from swanky hotel room to swanky hotel room under false, or even his real identity. Keep moving, and you don&#039;t get caught.

Long Live DPR!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interestingly, profiling DPR reveals two distinct characters. It&#039;s plainly visible that the complaint has fabricated details. Either DPR is a psychopath, or he isn&#039;t. You don&#039;t suddenly become one because you&#039;re now running an illicit online black market. I just can&#039;t decide exactly why they chose to fabricate the counterfeit identification, and two solicitations of murder. It&#039;s to either hide details revealing illegalities of their investigation, to omit critical components of their investigation, or, in the case of the latter, to destroy his character.

				I thought about the ID situation being a potential gov&#039;t set-up as well. I mean we all know how easy that would be once they learned his real name through his gmail account. But it still wouldn&#039;t explain why Ulbricht openly mentioned &quot;that anyone can buy things like this on TOR and the Silk Road&quot; like whaaa? He may have just gotten overconfident in his own system/vendors, that he felt safe and started to be very lax about security. <br /><br />If I was DPR, as soon as the NSA spying revelations/capabilities were leaked by Snowden I would have left the country. Too much extralegal/illegal usage of resources by our own gov&#039;t to get &quot;the bad guys.&quot; Why that didn&#039;t scare him off to a beach somewhere is surely a question he unfortunately will be asking himself over and over again in a concrete box for the rest of his life (I hope not) courtesy of our new police state.<br /><br />But, on a lighter note... I received an international order from that was marked &#039;in transit&#039; before the shutdown. Address was encrypted, but it made it. Very happy about that. This movement doesn&#039;t die with DPR&#039;s bust. We will only come back bigger and even better than before.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
