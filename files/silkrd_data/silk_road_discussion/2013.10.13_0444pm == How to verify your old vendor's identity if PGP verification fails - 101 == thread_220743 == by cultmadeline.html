				If your vendor updated his PGP key immediately after the SR takedown, you likely will not be able to verify who he says he is.&nbsp; In this case, I suggest you provide him/her 4-10- random usernames, one of which should be your old username.<br /><br />If you are a frequent customer, your vendor should have no problem identifying you and your purchase history.&nbsp; If you are a new customer, wait until the feedbacks of frequent customers kick in.<br /><br />I hope this helps ease your mind.<br /><br />&lt;3LucyMcgee<br />CultMadeline<br /><br />

				Thank you for this. <br />I&#039;m a buyer who got a new key after the shit hit the fan and attempted to contact another vendor on BMR but they will not let me identify myself with them unless I have the same PGP key as before. This has been the most upsetting part of this whole take down for me. I understand they&#039;re just looking out for themselves, but I mean I just got done finalizing an order from the vendor like a day or two before the site went down and I was actually just about to send my coins over to my SR account to purchase another order from this vendor only to realize the site was seized. It was a good thing I didn&#039;t go ahead and send them over before logging in. I still wish I could do business with them, but it looks like my money&#039;s going elsewhere for now.
