				I think he means A. Running an outdated version of TBB or Firefox that the attack exploited, B. Browsing Tor with JavaScript enabled, or C.

With a site like SR, you&#039;re talking about international communications. FISA gives the government the authority to spy on communications between&nbsp; US citizens and foreign nationals. Even if you&#039;re only dealing with people domestically, TOR is routing you through other countries.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s always been the case or not, but since beginning of the Patriot Act and the war on terror, it&#039;s all done in the name of terroism prevention.<br /><br />Even if you had some sort of constitutional protection, all they have to do is appear before the FISA court and get a warrant to spy on you.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

You can verify that it&#039;s a legitimate update and see what the changes are on Mozilla&#039;s web site.<br /><br />And if you&#039;re talking about TorBrowser, then you definitely should update. If you&#039;re browser is opening to the page check.torproject.org and it says there is a security patch available, then you should immediately download and install it. Just make sure you take the normal precautions about opening files downloaded through tor. You should also verify the signature if you know how. It&#039;s pretty easy in Windows and Linux. I&#039;ve never tried in OS X, but I think it&#039;s the same commands as Linux.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Therefore, even disabling javascript is not protecting you to the best degree.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is an excellent point +1 since my dumb ass forgot to mention it.<br /><br />StExo is 100% right about them using 0-days to exploit browser vulnerabilities. And yes, these&nbsp; aren&#039;t detected by AV software. I didn&#039;t think of it from that perspective because I don&#039;t run AV software on Linux. With the FH malware, I have no idea if those users had javascript enaled or not. It was a 0-day exploit in older versions of FF. Make sure your browser has the latest security patches installed! The FH malware affected unpatched versions of FF. IF you&#039;re using TBB, keep in mind that it uses FF 17 ESR. The current version of FF is 24, and I want to say that that particular 0-day was patched in FF 21. TBB has been patched since that happened. It&#039;s just a matter of time before the next one though.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217990.msg1591066#msg1591066">Quote from: StExo on October 05, 2013, 04:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you want to look into a better degree of protection, lookup a virtual machine deployment called Whonix - that is what people like me and astor use because it means even if the NSA done a full browser exploit and actually managed to get root access to the virtual machine it runs in, they still would not be able to identify your IP, hostname, mac address, hardware etc and so is pretty much right now the best protection you can use which doesn&#039;t require too much knowledge. Be wary it is persistent however and therefore you should keep the VM on an encrypted drive just like you would for all the usual programs. Whonix is significantly more secure than TAILS assuming you use it right and don&#039;t disable its security features so I&#039;d recommend switching. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d like to add that if you&#039;re running Windows, you&#039;re much more a risk. I run Linux, but I&#039;m so small time as far as buyers go that I&#039;m off the governments radar (or I&#039;m on a part of it they&#039;ve chosen to ignore).[/quote]<br /><br />As for Whonix, I can&#039;t get my vm to install the workstation version. It doesn&#039;t recognize the file extension (and I did check the signature/checksum). But if you can get it working, it&#039;s a hell of a lot easier than running TAILS of a thumb. I hate running OSs on thumbs it&#039;s a PITA. VMs are better. <br /><br />Give it a shot. I&#039;m still working on that one. Even if you can&#039;t get it up and running, Try another Linux distro. You have to adjust some of the securrity features out of the box, but most Linux distros are easy to use and more secure than Windows.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217990.msg1591066#msg1591066">Quote from: StExo on October 05, 2013, 04:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, principles remain the same. If the NSA want to find you or want to access you&#039;re computer, you aren&#039;t going to be able to stop them sorry, they are simply too big, too powerful and have all the best people working for them, so the best you can do really is make yourself a smaller target by changing names regularly etc because it is infeasible for the NSA to go around creating individual exploits due to the cost involved and the amount of staff time it consumes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What&#039;s the old saying about the only kind of unhackable PC? It&#039;s something like the kind locked in a room by itself not connected to anything (can&#039;t remember the actual line, but it&#039;s something like that) <br /><br />If you&#039;re a small time, personal use buyer who doesn&#039;t ordinarily have large sums of cash, who doesn&#039;t make suspicious bank transactions or cash out large sums of btc, then you don&#039;t need to worry as much. If your a vendor or a large reseller, it&#039;s a different stories.<br /><br />You should follow StExo&#039;s advice; he&#039;s more of a security expert than me. But if you lack the technical know how to get that done and want to try another version of Linux, I can answer questions about all but the most advanced versions of Linux (don&#039;t ask me about Arch or Gentoo) and am willing to help anyone who can&#039;t figure it out. If you need help with something like that, PM me.

I presume yes right?<br /><br />Also, should I make sure that all my tor browsing is shut off while I do it.<br /><br />And last question, I should never use any site on tor which isn&#039;t a .onion, is this correct??<br /><br />Forgive my ignorance in not knowing this but your answer is greatly appreciated, thank you.<br /><br />Peace out, <br />Evoc<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes you should update Firefox when the updates come out, especially if it&#039;s an out-of-band (not regularly scheduled) update. You can verify that it&#039;s a legitimate update and see what the changes are on Mozilla&#039;s web site.<br /><br />And if you&#039;re talking about TorBrowser, then you definitely should update. If you&#039;re browser is opening to the page check.torproject.org and it says there is a security patch available, then you should immediately download and install it. Just make sure you take the normal precautions about opening files downloaded through tor. You should also verify the signature if you know how. It&#039;s pretty easy in Windows and Linux. I&#039;ve never tried in OS X, but I think it&#039;s the same commands as Linux.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Thanks man, cheers for the reply. +1 when I have it back up.<br /><br />Peace out,<br />Evoc</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
