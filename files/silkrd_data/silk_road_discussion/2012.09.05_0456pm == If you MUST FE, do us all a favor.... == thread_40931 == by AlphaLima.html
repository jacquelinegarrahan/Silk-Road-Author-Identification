				Complete the feedback!! So many vendors have a 100 rating, and 1/3 or more of their feedback is: &quot;leave feedback here&quot; or &quot;FE for trusted vendor&quot;. Really? This feedback was left 2 weeks ago, a month ago, 6 weeks ago....what happened??<br /><br />FE for trusted vendor ~ how do you know that? Have you done business with them before? If you have say so! It&#039;s just a few extra keystrokes. FE for trusted vendor, use Joeblow all the time, product great, shipping fast. Never disappoints. <br /><br />How are the rest of us supposed to honestly evaluate vendors if you don&#039;t update the feedback? Did you get your stuff? Did you get ripped off? Was the product as advertised or was it bunk? Did it take weeks to get to you? Was it there in a few days? Did the vendor communicate with you? What????<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to leave negative feedback if it&#039;s honestly warranted. If you got scammed, say so. Help your fellow buyers out by telling us to stay away from this vendor. <br />If they came through, say so. FE&#039;d....updating my feedback, dude rocks. It doesn&#039;t take that long and it&#039;s a huge help to the rest of us. <br /><br />It would be best if you didn&#039;t FE at all, but if you insist, finish the transaction all the way through to updating the feedback.

				Another good one is:<br /><br />&quot;Took 5 days to arrive.&quot; <br /><br />Maybe not just that on it&#039;s own - but annoys me when people don&#039;t state their country... how does that statement help any potential buyer? They could be on the moon for all we know, with Virgin&#039;s Inter-Galactic shuttle delivering mail.... Bah!

				+1 Way too many people leave feedback and forget. It&#039;s almost like people are too paranoid to come back on SR after a transaction because they feel they may have been compromised. It is important that you update feedback on your purchases! It can make the difference between a vendor being able to get by with sub-par practices and a vendor doing shit right.

				Personally, if I *have to* finalize early, I don&#039;t leave feedback until I get the product.&nbsp; This way, a.) The vendor doesn&#039;t get an additional &quot;FE will update&quot; on their page, and b.) It forces me to remember to update the feedback once I get the item, since the feedback box is still on my Orders page.&nbsp; If I leave the &quot;FE will update&quot;, then the only way I can update is if I go to my account, then view the feedbacks, then find the one I need, and click edit...too much work!&nbsp; <br /><br />Plus, how can I possibly know what rating I should give for the order?&nbsp; All I did was place the order, the vendor marked it In Transit, and I released my bitcoins--does that really entitle the vendor to an immediate 5/5?&nbsp; Be smart--don&#039;t leave &quot;feedback&quot; until their is something worth commenting on...like receiving your order!<br /><br />That being said, try not to FE ever, unless you like taking risks.&nbsp; Even the most established and reputable vendors can turn and walk away with your money.&nbsp; Thats the risk.&nbsp; If you stay in escrow, there is almost no risk whatsoever.<br /><br />

				I didn&#039;t know you could do that. Do you just leave it blank...how do you do it? The feedback box always pops up when I hit finalize. It&#039;s not great to ding the guy just because you FE&#039;d, but he shouldn&#039;t automatically get a 5/5 either. <br /><br />Of course, if people would stay in escrow as SR strongly recommends this could be avoided. <br /><br />I&#039;ve only been here a couple of weeks, but noobs need to be aware they don&#039;t have to FE. Just because you don&#039;t have buying stats doesn&#039;t mean you have no choice. There are plenty of vendors that don&#039;t work outside of the escrow. Use them.<br /><br />

				You don&#039;t have to fill out feedback, you can let it sit at that stage as long as you like. Just because it pops up doesn&#039;t mean you have to do anything with it.

				You can cancel out of the order without leaving feedback after FE&#039;ing. I think there should just be an option to leave feedback later if you do FE. Making new threads weekly about the issue does nothing to help the situation.

				Thank you for taking the time to explain it so well. It is not intuitive; it looks like finalizing and leaving feedback are linked.

				I agree, I was just checking out a product I was interested in and when I viewed the feedback all I saw was this:<br /><br />FE for trusted vendor<br />FE early<br />FE will update<br />FE for trusted vendor<br />FE<br />FE<br />Asked to FE early<br /><br />etc...etc...etc..<br /><br />and then the latest actual real reviews you&#039;ll find are listed from 1 or 2 months ago...so as an interested buyer it&#039;s hard to find out what&#039;s going on with the vendor or how the current product is when all you see is FEs and month old reviews.

				I just found this thread after being prompted for feedback after doing my first FE.&nbsp; I now know to not submit feedback yet but others are going to keep submitting feedback early unless the feedback page on SR is updated to clarify that feedback can be left and changed at a later time.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t something I&#039;m going to bother getting upset about though.&nbsp; I appreciate whoever maintains SR and totally up to them whether it is worth their time to make these kinds of improvements.

				A relatively easy change to allow you to leave feedback later would benefit everyone, but like you said, its not up to us, its an ongoing issue that seems to be overlooked every upgrade.
