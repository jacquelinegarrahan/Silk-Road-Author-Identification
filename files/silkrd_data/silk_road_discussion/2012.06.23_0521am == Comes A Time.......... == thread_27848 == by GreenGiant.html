				I would like to start by thanking all my customers, it has been fantastic serving you all! I had been working online privately for around 3 years before Silk Road was created. The idea of working so openly worried me and the thought of dealing within escrow just seemed crazy, i signed up anyway thinking i would never use the account! <br /><br />Needless to say after a couple of months of reading on the forums, browsing feedback and generally watching Silk Road evolve i ended up taking the plunge and Well here I am pretty much a year later. I have had a couple of lows but most of the journey on the Road has been great, I have been amazed at how well the system works and how positive the large majority of my transactions were. <br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts I commend you, what you have created it is not only great but it is special, It really has shown me that 99% of the people out there are good honest caring people who aren&#039;t just out to abuse the system. Buyers, Other Vendors, Silk Road Staff And Dread Pirate Roberts, I really do thank you all we have all played a part in something special and i hope it continues on until the world powers end the wasteful war on drugs.<br /><br />I am sorry to announce this, but due to life commitments and personal needs as of the END OF JULY I am taking a break from vending and I will no longer be a permanent fixture on Silk Road. I may pop up randomly once or twice every couple of months with small quantities, if i have anything available, and if i did it would be very limited amounts.<br /><br />I do know I will be back toward the end of the year, maybe the start of next year, so hopefully I&#039;ll pick up where i left off but better ;) <br /><br />It really has been a pleasure serving you all,<br />If your reading this, take it easy and smoke a fat one!<br /><br />GreenGiant<br /><br />&quot;Comes A Time&quot;<br />by Neil Young<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixE-_k6QpAY<br /><br />Comes a time<br />when you&#039;re driftin&#039;<br />Comes a time<br />when you settle down<br />Comes a light<br />feelin&#039;s liftin&#039;<br />Lift that baby<br />right up off the ground.<br /><br />Oh, this old world<br />keeps spinning round<br />It&#039;s a wonder tall trees<br />ain&#039;t layin&#039; down<br />There comes a time.<br /><br />You and I we were captured<br />We took our souls<br />and we flew away<br />We were right<br />we were giving<br />That&#039;s how we kept<br />what we gave away.<br /><br />Oh, this old world<br />keeps spinning round<br />It&#039;s a wonder tall trees<br />ain&#039;t layin&#039; down<br />There comes a time.
