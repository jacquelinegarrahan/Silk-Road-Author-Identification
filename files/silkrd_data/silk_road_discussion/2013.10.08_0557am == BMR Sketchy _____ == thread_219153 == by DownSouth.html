				They waited until ex SR members registered and deposited bitcoins, then they don&#039;t let &quot;customers&quot; log in because of an &quot;upgrade to v5&quot;, but sellers can log in. So &quot;customers&quot; are in the dark about their orders and their bitcoins are being held hostage for &quot;a couple of days&quot;. Am I the only one that finds this odd?

				I deposited for the first time 12 hrs before the upgrades and my coins didn&#039;t show up... then they started the upgrade so I&#039;m also in the same situation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe its dodgy though as you suggested.. <br /><br />why would they try to swipe a little BTC now when they can be making millions in commission in a month or two ?<br /><br />but yeah.. not impressed with the site so far... if they knew there was going to be upgrade it would of been nice to be told so in advance we could take our BTC else where (for those of us lucky enough to have it show up in their accounts :p).

I got scammed by a seller on BMR for a $200 MP for bitcoins. It seems as though BMR does not allow any listing with a 0 btc and the sellers listing said to message them. So, in my haste to get my BMR account going, I did. Then, I find out in the forums that sellers are not allowed to sell bitcoins, except in the exchange ( to prevent scamming). The listing was put up on 3/25. So they just let this listing go, for over 6 months, even though it&#039;s totally against the BMR rules? Basically, they let me get scammed by not removing this listing.<br />I contacted BMR support, but I have not heard a peep from them.<br />It seems like they are slapping ex SR members in the face to me.

				I can certainly understand why they are upgrading. They just got a pile of refugees flood in. They are probably shoring up security and adding features that Silk Road users expect.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how honest they are, but they have all the motive in the world to run an honest operation and make tons in commission. They would be stupid to try to grab a small amount now.<br /><br />In the past it has lacked a critical mass which I think made it only profitable for scammers. But now that SR&#039;s vendors and customers are going there a thriving market may form which will result in scammers being less welcome.<br /><br />Just a theory/hope/dream.

				Guys BMR is fine, its a security issue and its a huge concern to everybody. that&#039;s why they blocked registration, all coins are good and in their proper places, i promise this and many people can see this. Vendors can see the coins, the orders, and even withdraw. <br /><br />This is the moment they have been waiting for, they will not blow it, at least for a long time and i would bet my life on it. I would recommend keeping the paranoia to yourself right now though as it may scare some people away and that is bad for everybody. its the buyers and sellers that make a place and we want to draw as many people to one place as possible for the best experience possible. In a day or twos time when everything is back up you will see, but for now be patient. This is the last thing they would want to do, they are about to get loaded with orders. Last thing anybody needs is to scare people over to the black sheep to loose even more money.

				Here&#039;s my 2 cents. <br /><br />With a view of avoiding more paranoia/panic. <br /><br />I&#039;m only a small time buyer, so it&#039;s just my perspective. <br /><br />I used BMR last year when SR went down for like 10 days or whatever it was.... <br /><br />3 Different Vendors, 3 Different Products - International &amp; Domestic Orders. <br /><br />All transactions went flawlessly. <br /><br />I think people need to have faith in BMR and give it some time. While you have to be more cautious in avoiding Scammers - This is easily done by checking forums &amp; using common sense. <br /><br />BMR has been extremely gracious in accepting SR admins, and Backopy seems generally concerned about implementing new infrastructure to handle the traffic, along with improving security protocols. <br /><br />THIS IS EXTREMELY POSITIVE.<br /><br />I think we need to take a step back given the recent events.... <br /><br />I will be using BMR again...... I suggest we give it a chance.... <br /><br />While there might be some old bad blood, and they may have done some sketchy things this doesn&#039;t really concern me.... the proof is in the pudding and if it comes back online and I can order from reputable vendors I&#039;m on board.... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
