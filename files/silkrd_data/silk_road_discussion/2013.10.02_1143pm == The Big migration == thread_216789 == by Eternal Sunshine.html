				I suggest all vendors go to the black market (until a better alternative is available). BMR&#039;s biggest problem at the moment is low quality product and low quality vendors (including a lot of scammers). Their system seems alright and has escrow + rating.&nbsp; Sheep market doesn&#039;t have escrow so that&#039;s a big NO NO. <br /><br />In my opinion, BMR is the place to be selling at the moment. If we get the good vendors from SR on that site, it will drive the bad vendors away in no time.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t also &#039;t care much about the FBI watching this forum, browsing through our PM&#039;s. There are only a very few BIG vendors on SR. I mean, common, where I live they don&#039;t even make a bust if they aren&#039;t sure they are finding a few million X pills or more than 1000kg of cocaine.&nbsp; So even if you managed to make a 100k profit, your still a small fish. <br /><br />Also, the whole investigation is actually a big failure;&nbsp; they wasted almost 3 years of resources (while the world economy was collapsing) to find a guy and confiscate less then 3 million USD in bitcoin. Way to go! And they increased street crime because addicts (for example heroine users) will get their fix anyway so I guess they&#039;ll just rob a store and kill the manager because you took their bitcoins.&nbsp; I suggest everyone stops paying taxes because LE is clearly promoting total anarchy.<br /><br />Silkroad was actually one of the biggest solutions on &quot;the war on drugs&quot; because it disarmed the &quot;soldiers&quot; involved. Governments are&nbsp; just to stupid to see it.<br /><br />To finish I would like to say to the FBI fags reading this topic, it&#039;s not you against one man, it&#039;s not you against 1 website. It&#039;s you against 150 000 individual buyers, get real you&#039;ll never win. DPR I wish you the best of luck but don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ve really started something and in my opinion you changed the world forever.

				very well stated, including the point that druggies will now have to go to the streets. the feds fixed nothing but making drug procurement more dangerous, more expensive, and leaving quality issues in question. They arrest one man, but there are literately 100&#039;s of thousands buyers (just here) so....lock&#039;m all up?? So what&#039;s your end game?? Aside from animal cruelty, I can&#039;t think of any lower life than those whose likelihood is derived from arresting drug users. This whole issue makes me sick...

				I posted this in your other thread but:<br />Actually sheep does have escrow... And sheep seems way easier/faster to use. BMR seems the opposite in every way. I strongly suggest sheep as the place everyone moves to, though it seems both will battle for the #1 spot

				Yes; they&#039;ll have to fix that. But i see more future in a custom made platform that has been around for a long time than a website running on twitter API without escrow. BTW; i remember having alot of downtime on SR back in the days; it&#039;s easy to fix. They already have a semi active community and at least we&#039;re sure we don&#039;t get an atlantis flashback.
