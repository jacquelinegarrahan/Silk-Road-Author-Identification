				Really won&#039;t make a difference, peeps. <br /><br />Denial attacks from a single source tend to generate millions, if not tens of millions of GET requests from a server, so laying off the F5 is not going to make a blind bit of difference to the poor cunt looking at the logs. Trust me on this.<br /><br />Having said that.......go easy eh and go make a cuppa ;)<br /><br /><br />

				Maybe posting minute to minute updates on the status of the site is the reason the forums stopped getting hit...<br /><br />and are we making it easier for the attacker by constantly refreshing SR and posting our results here?<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting for an update from DPR, we&#039;ve always gotten an updates when its back up<br />

				Guys Lets get the attack name were under CORRECT! ITS NOT A DDOS! ITS A DOS!! just for your enlightenment..<br /><br />&nbsp;DOS=<br />A denial of service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to make a server or a network resource unavailable to users, usually by temporarily interrupting or suspending the services of a host connected to the Internet.This means that one computer and one internet connection is used to flood a server with packets (TCP / UDP). The point of such a denial of service attack is to overload the targeted server’s bandwidth and other resources. This will make the server inaccessible to others, thereby blocking the website or whatever else is hosted there.&nbsp; &nbsp;WERE ON A TOR NETWORK, U HAVE TO HIT A DIRECT IP ADDRESS, it takes nothing to hit &#039;NEW IDENTITY&quot; DOS is somewhat diffrent..<br /><br />DDOS=<br />DDoS<br />A DDoS Attack is a Distributed Denial of Service Attack.<br /><br />In most respects it is similar to a DoS attack but the results are much, much different. Instead of one computer and one internet connection the DDoS attack utilises many computers and many connections. The computers behind such an attack are often distributed around the whole world and will be part of what is known as a botnet. The main difference between a DDoS attack vs a DoS attack, therefore, is that the target server will be overload by hundreds or even thousands of requests in the case of the former as opposed to just one attacker in the case of the latter.<br /><br />&nbsp;WERE ON A TOR NETWORK, U HAVE TO HIT A DIRECT IP ADDRESS, it takes nothing to hit &#039;NEW IDENTITY&quot; DOS is somewhat different..<br /><br />UNless im missing something here? How can a DDOS attack a IP address that can be changed with a click, and specially on a TOR net work..&nbsp; ONIONS <br /><br /><br />If i am wrong in anyway please do correct me and enlighten me to how its a DDOS on a tor Onion site? Not trying to act like a know it all, please dnt take it that way but its just been in my head how? how is this? a DDOS?<br /><br />

When you talk about clicking &#039;new identity&#039;, that changes what exit node you use. But since SR is a hidden service, you don&#039;t use an exit node with it, so that is irrelevant. With my basic knowledge of Tor and hidden services, i&#039;ll suggest that the silk road introduction points are the only things which can be targeted. A database keeps a record of which Tor nodes are introduction points for each hidden service. So the attacker is presumably targeting these introduction points.<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en (clearnet)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Defense against Denial of Service of Introduction Points<br /><br />The adversarial version of the previous section involves attackers intentionally hammering the Introduction Points of a Hidden Service to make it unreachable by honest clients. This means that an attacker can temporarily bring down a Hidden Service by DoSing a small number of Tor relays.<br />To defend against such attacks, Syverson and Øverlier introduced Valet nodes in their PETS 2006 paper: &quot;Valet Services: Improving Hidden Servers with a Personal Touch&quot;. Valet nodes stand in front of Introduction Points and act as a protection layer. This allows Hidden Services to maintain a limited number of Introduction Points, but many more contact points, without clients learning the actual addresses of the Introduction Points.<br />Valet nodes are not implemented yet, mainly because of the big implementation and deployment effort they require.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
