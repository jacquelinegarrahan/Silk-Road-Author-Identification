				Don&#039;t prices change according to BTC rate?<br /><br />I thought that if Bitcoin went down or up, then the price in bitcoin would change to reflect the price in dollars, or not?<br /><br />

				If btc were stable that would make sense but with all of the crazy ups and downs, a product based on bitcoin could be priced at a fraction of the actual within in a day which would screw the vendor over. On the flip side if the value of bitcoins drops more like it has then a vendor might find that their product is extremely overpriced on the dollar and then they lose sales. Either way, vendor loses. One day I&#039;m sure we all dream the bitcoin will stabilize and then all will be well haha.

				I still don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t sellers simply fix all their prices to dollars, so no matter what happens to BTC rate (up or down), the price in dollars is always the same.<br /><br />What am I missing here?<br />

				I think most sellers do fix their prices to dollars. I&#039;m not sure of any that don&#039;t actually.

				I&#039;m just hoping Israel will hurry up and drop a Daisy Cutter on Iran soon. That should drive currency markets crazy and hopefully drive some interest to the BC. I got real Lucky. On Friday..and dont ask me how I knew, I shorted Bitcoins on Margin over at CampBx at 2.40. Kaa-Ching! Made a killing, about the equivalent of a full ounce of good weed. What most people dont understand is that BC&#039;s are fairly close in behavior to other currencies and if you have a little cashola to burn you can buy Options on BC&#039;s.

				Mito your right. I know I threw out a Bomb (no pun intended) on Israel dropping on Iran...strong discussion for another Forum I&#039;m sure. Doing Nothing will give Iran Loonies &quot;The Bomb&quot; and then what do you think consequences will be? May sound Cold Shit, but 9/11 woke up the Precious Metals Market which slumbered since 1978. Look at prices of Gold/Silver since 9/11. An event that I mention will create havoc..Volitility is where you make your Profits.<br />Someone will always profit from this events. I see BitCoins as having a great profit potential because of these fluctuations. One risks their BC&#039;s every time they place an order on SR. Why not balance the risk in going Short or Long on Margin for BC&#039;s.
