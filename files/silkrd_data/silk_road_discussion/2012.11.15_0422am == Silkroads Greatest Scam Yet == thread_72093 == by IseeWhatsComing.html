If you don&#039;t believe me ask me any question you&#039;d like about gar kat gummystars familyforever usareshipper or traveller. They were all my accounts. I know a lot more about the scams and interworkings of this site than you would believe. You mods know who you are. Half of them are accomplices in most of these large scams.

				Seriously, calm down dude, I&#039;m with lim on this one, any time I&#039;ve ever had a problem with transactions of BTC, SR staff always gets it sorted out within 4 hours to a few days. I was freaking out last week about 100 btc that didn&#039;t show up in my account for four days. They told me to give it up to 72 hours before I really freak out, after that though, it got sent right through. You just gotta be straight up, yet tactful when dealing with people about money man. oh yeah, and patient.

				i feel like &quot;BE SMART PEOPLE!&#039; should be turned into a meme on this forum.<br /><br />or maybe it could become the tagline. &quot;Silk Road Marketplace - BE SMART PEOPLE!&quot;<br /><br />i wonder whether the nimrods who run around in their tin foil hats understand economics.<br /><br />i read somewhere on Monday that the first 3 days of the outage caused btc transactions to drop around 16%. so we can assume that a fair chunk of those 16% of all transactions would otherwise have been made through Silk Road.<br /><br />and so Tin Foil hat geniuses, why do you suppose DPR would rip you all off and kill a service that he just spent 6 days fixing, when instead he can continue taking commissions on 16% of all btc transactions, becoming very rich, at almost no risk - if you look at the terms and conditions of this site, they&#039;re designed like file-sharing sites have started to write theirs. it places all burden for using this site on the vendor and the buyer, not on DPR.<br /><br />you people are fuckin retarded.

				^^This. LOL<br /><br />The aussie dude from the bottom of page 2 got it on the nose. DPR makes so much commission from this site that it would make no sense to cut and run with 2-3 days worth of deposits. Hundreds of vendors probably thought the same thing and will be reluctant to let go of major product until withdrawals are 100% fixed. Same goes for buyers looking to spend huge sums of money on here. Many are simply going to wait a while instead of just depositing everything within 1-2 days of the site re-opening. What&#039;s he going to get? A bunch of small deposits for personal stash orders? Yeah, that&#039;s worth keeping the site offline for like five days and losing all those sales. DPR would have to keep withdrawal crippled for so long that half the users would stop trusting SR.<br /><br />Even if he/she had to ditch SR in an emergency, I doubt DPR would go out of his way to plan this whole thing.

				I don&#039;t know how you can assume that the &quot;hype&quot; over being down for days, and not allowing new customers, is going to build up so much EXTRA revenue that wouldn&#039;t have come in during the outage.<br /><br />More than likely, people spent their money elsewhere.&nbsp; There may be a slightly high number of orders placed in the next few days, but to assume that it 100% compensates (or surpasses) the revenue that for sure would have been generated otherwise is naive.<br /><br />Vendors and DPR are in it to make money.&nbsp; To assume DPR is scamming the system to fuck with us all, is silly and would be an atrocious business idea.&nbsp; The other couple places have been getting more traffic with the outage, if anything it&#039;ll probably make the number of active users go down a tad.&nbsp; Anyone who doesn&#039;t like it here and thinks they&#039;re being taken advantage of can go elsewhere...

But you&#039;re considering a few points wrong; Firstly, to achieve a 2.2m commission, SR would have to do 440,000 transactions@$50 each(bare minimum) or up to... a lot more than that for a lower or MUCH lower fee. This pushes it into the realm of 100M, as I&#039;ve already suggested. Secondly, SR&#039;s success depends on the bitcoin market and the exchange of bitcoins for government currency. To simply steal everyone&#039;s money and run would CRASH THE BITCOIN MARKET, rendering all the profits entirely worthless.<br /><br />The only way to DPR to MAKE money from running SR is to KEEP running SR.<br /><br />Consider, as a point to strengthen my argument, the 1Dky-bitcoin address that is largely believed to belong to the Road. The funds it received, as of this writing, totaled in the 600K-level of bitcoins. Forbes used that address, back when it had 400K and was valued at roughly 2.2 million, to give their 22 million-estimation. Forbes was essentially working on the more public fee-number of 10%, rather than the sliding-fee that it really is, by appearances.<br /><br />If we assume these 600K bitcoins were earned only as the profit from running the road, that means that SR has done anywhere from AT LEAST 6 million bitcoins worth of transactions... to an even greater amount, if my own estimations are accurate.<br /><br />This means that in the span of one year, 6 million or more bitcoins were transferred to and from the Road. If we assume that in any given month there is 1/12th of that available for a cut-and-run, that means in any given month he would make less from taking everything and disappearing than he would keeping the system running... and if he cuts and runs, the SYSTEM ENDS and nothing more is ever earned. The long-term earnings far outweigh the short-term gain from a scam.<br /><br />Plus, again, it would crash the market. DPR literally can&#039;t pull a scam, at this point.

				i&#039;ve been skeptical about DPR for a year now.&nbsp; i was only starry eyed for a month or so until i really started thinking about the nature of this criminal organization and the kind of person who would lead such a venture.<br /><br />but honestly, over the year, DPR has earned my trust.&nbsp; I really feel that his political and philosophical convictions outweigh any opportunistic greed.&nbsp; if this were a scam, i think he would have packed up and left us all to drown, but it seems that he is being as transparent as possible in regards to the current situation.&nbsp; what would be the point of leaving the forums up &amp; giving updates when he could just take the money and run, and then dissolve this whole community with a few mouse clicks?&nbsp; we are indeed in uncharted waters, and despite whatever differences in political opinion we may have, I am standing by our captain on this one.<br /><br />yarrrrr!

				Man, 1 topic in 3 is paranoia crap. I get a fucking headache when I see just how illogical some people can get.<br /><br />DPR wouldn&#039;t scam shit not only because (I sincerely believe) he&#039;s an anarchist and an idealist but also because he earns some money with this store.<br /><br />Long Live SR &amp; DPR &amp; sellers. And long live the customers who stand by SR &amp; its staff.<br /><br />Now, let&#039;s see how many days are necessary for things to get back to normal, so I can get my MDMA and love the fuck out of you all, paranoid and non-paranoids alike! :D
