				Hello Comrades,<br /><br />New to the community and after a couple of days looking around I have a few questions if you have the time.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; As a Canadian, what is the best way to obtain bitcoins?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; What does Finalize Early (FE) mean?&nbsp; What is it all about?&nbsp; How do I go about doing it with vendors<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Why the sudden drop of quanitty of available goods on SR? Yesterday was pretty abundant and today seems scarce.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; How do you secure your shipping address to the vendor?&nbsp; I saw something about PGT or something of that acronym.&nbsp; any thoughts here?<br /><br />Cheers mates!

IDK if CA has MoneyPaks.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; What does Finalize Early (FE) mean?&nbsp; What is it all about?&nbsp; How do I go about doing it with vendors. - FE means you release your funds to the vendor BEFORE you receive your product. You see, funds here are held in escrow. The vendor wont actually get his coins until YOU release them. Never do this. Ever. It&#039;s a grade A scam technique. If a vendor requires it, find a new vendor to use. There are plenty that wont make you FE.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Why the sudden drop of quanitty of available goods on SR? Yesterday was pretty abundant and today seems scarce. - Some days are big days, some aren&#039;t. Make sure you don&#039;t have &quot;Domestic Only&quot; checked.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; How do you secure your shipping address to the vendor?&nbsp; I saw something about PGT or something of that acronym.&nbsp; any thoughts here? - PGP. Personally, I dont use it because if the federal government REALLY thinks they need to arrest me for some cannabis products and xanax, well, I&#039;m down for rent free food and lodging. But, if you want to use it or vendors require it, use it. - See : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />Cheers mates!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cheers!

In theory, this is done before the vendor has actually put your order into the postal system.<br />2.1) Ask the vendor to use a DCN instead of requesting you to FE.<br />3) There is no drop. You might be searching for domestic instead of global, for example. Or perhaps some people sold out.<br />4) PGP/GPG. Gpg4win will cover you if you&#039;re on a windows-machine.<br />5) Put some leg-work into answering these yourself, instead of asking somethings that are answered in several places already.

				Bitinstant doesn&#039;t support Canadian $ last I checked. CAVirtex is probably your best source for BTC in Canada.
