				I don&#039;t know if anyone has heard of this before, but there is a site (http://silkroadxmx45vk4.onion) which looks just like the silk road login, except it also asks you for your PIN. This is obviously a scam to hijack accounts.<br /><br />What troubles me is that if you look up the Hidden Wiki on google, the first onion url result takes you to a possibly fake identical hidden wiki, that links you to the scam site with the link to the Silk Road. Be wary, my friends. NEVER enter your PIN at login, DPR would never require this.

				This is a well-known scam, you&#039;re right.&nbsp; It&#039;s best for users to try to memorize the correct URL and to remember - like you mentioned - that the real SR site NEVER requires your PIN at login!

Ive seen a couple of horror stories about the phising site getting account info and withdrawing members BTC.&nbsp;

				There&#039;s plenty of steps you can take to ensure you&#039;re not going to get virtually robbed.<br /><br />- Remember the URL<br />- Don&#039;t keep any BTC&#039;s in the SR wallet that you&#039;re not willing to lose.<br />- Use a decant password, letters numbers symbols etc etc<br /><br />People should not be browsing through the clearnet (non-onion links and search engines) to click through to SilkRoad. Just remember the URL, and type it yourself. vb5piz3r is not hard to remember. Silkroad and .onion should be common sense. :)
