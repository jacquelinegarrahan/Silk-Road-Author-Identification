				So I just deposited some cash with Bitinstant through Walmart. They do it through MoneyGram. I cam home, went to track the order because it wasn&#039;t in my wallet and all 3 orders show up as &quot;Order Execution Failed&quot;. Does anyone know what in the fuck is going on? I searched google and found a couple of forum threads that went nowhere. Yes, I&#039;m freaked the fuck out. <br /><br />Time stamps on tracking show when I set up the order -- &quot;quote for new transaction&quot;, then show the &quot;new order&quot; when I paid at WalMart, and then 1 minute later &quot;Order Execution Failed&quot;

				write to bitinstant through the contact us. I&#039;ve had questions answered by the CTO and CEO directly. I made a bitinstant transaction today. Had some initial problems but they got worked out and ordered appeared in reasonable time.

				Yes, I triple and quadruple checked all the amounts and account #s. I&#039;m talking to &quot;Yankee&quot; on their IRC right now and he said it will &quot;be filled in 4 minutes&quot;, I&#039;m just wondering why it says failed.

				I just want to say that the customer service so far has been stellar. I have most of my funds as of now, but it was about $24 short. &quot;Yankee&quot; in the IRC channel is looking into and simultaneously helping others in the channel as well. Very impressed with my first Bitinstant transaction even if it has had some hiccups.

				I went thru BitInstant one time.&nbsp; They gave me double my order, so I ended up with double the coins.&nbsp; Kinda surprised me, actually.&nbsp; Would totally use them again, whether I got double my coins again or not.&nbsp; Just seemed like fate was telling me if I decide to order again, go thru bitinstant.&nbsp; Lmao.
