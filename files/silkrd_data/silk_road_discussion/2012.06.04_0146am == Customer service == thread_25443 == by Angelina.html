				Hey everyone, <br /><br />Looking for feedback on a customer service issue. A buyer orders and then the item goes into auto finalize.&nbsp; More than 30 days after the order, I get a PM from buyer that he hasn&#039;t received the item yet and is looking for a tracking number. It was for a tiny sample size order, sent first class and I didn&#039;t use a tracking number or DCN (can&#039;t on these small letters).<br /><br /><br />What should I do? Seems crazy that someone would come back after so long to let me know they didn&#039;t get an item. <br /><br /><br />Thanks all,<br />Angelina

You have to balance out your right to money that you earned with the credibility, reputation and forthrightness that you would earn by just refunding and get it over with.<br /><br />In the long run, your increased reputation and respect will probably pay off much more (and I don&#039;t mean just in money terms) than fighting tooth and nail for every penny.<br /><br />Good luck to you any way you decide to go.<br /><br />goblin

				Thanks everyone for the feedback. Ultimately it&#039;s not much bitcoin in the grand scheme not a big deal. I think it&#039;s the principle of setting some precedent and parameters around how and when (and with who) to go over the top on customer service. <br /><br /><br />For example if someone emails and says they haven&#039;t received an item several days after it should have arrived, I&#039;ll ship a full replacement immediately.<br /><br /><br />What bugs me a lot is those cases where it seems like someone is attempting a scam&nbsp; :-\

				I&#039;m not a vendor, but I can say as a buyer if you feedback suck with a small amount of orders under your belt, I wouldn&#039;t order from you.<br />With that said, if it was a small order I&#039;d resend it to keep up a good rep. Although it sucks on your end. <br /><br />To the buyer, even if you don&#039;t read this, Why the fuck would you let something you didn&#039;t get auto-finalize. There&#039;s a resolution center for a reason. If it auto- finalizes and you didn&#039;t get you shouldn&#039;t expect anything for&nbsp; Angelina.

				It sux. I mean that&#039;s a long way down the road to come back asking for refund or reship. I would be weary of someone wanting a freebie

				Yes after auto-finalize and then waiting that long it seems to me a no brainer that this person is trying to scam you. It is a pain in the ass to receive negative ratings over some bs like this, it is a very fine line to walk being a vendor on here. I say its on them for not contacting sooner though.

				You may want to get a few DCNs for your future shipments, I know it may be hard for whatever type of product you have, but that also means you may have to make changes in your packaging.<br /><br />It will benefit you in the long run.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather spend a couple more dollars on better packaging and a DCN than to have my ratings and ultimately my business fail.<br /><br />sdesu
