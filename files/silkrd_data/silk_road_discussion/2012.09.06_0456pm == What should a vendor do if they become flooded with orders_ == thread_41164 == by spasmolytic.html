				I hear stories all the time on here about how one possible reason vendors jump ship, is that they get flooded with orders and get behind and eventually lose control of the entire operation all together.<br />If this is the case, then let&#039;s say a vendor ends up flooded with orders, I wanted to know why/how does it fall apart? and what can a vendor do to keep this from happening? and what should the vendor do if it does happen? I think the answers to these questions could help a lot of new vendors from letting it get over their head. If this has been brought up before in another thread or is vendor-only info, I apologize.<br />

				Something that could be done is to use the vacation mode feature on the sellers account.&nbsp; Use this feature so no new orders will come in until you get caught up.&nbsp; The vendor could post on the profile page the reason for the vacation is to catch up on orders and will be back open for business shortly.&nbsp; Being busy is not a reason to close up shop...

				I highly recommend vendors to limit listings to a small number.&nbsp; If you are selling 10 packs of Vicodin, only list 15 orders at a time.&nbsp; This way, you don&#039;t wake up to 80 orders, the max is 15.&nbsp; You will lose some business, but will keep your customer satisfaction level high because everyone will receive their product on time.&nbsp; When those sell out and are shipped, list another 15 (or 30, or whatever you can handle)<br /><br />One vendor that does this is GOA, and he always gets his shit out immediately (which is why he is loved).&nbsp; Wish he had more stuff here consistently.&nbsp;

				There&#039;s a couple of things that I do to control this. First off, I usually don&#039;t list my whole inventory at once. This way I can&#039;t get, lets say, 100 separate 1gr orders all in one day. Also, if I do get a lot of orders or know that I&#039;m going to be extra busy IRL, then I will just pull my listings all together.

However, if it literally just becomes too much (and you have to have a SHITLOAD of business for this to happen, like top 1-2% guys) then you can either hire some trusted help (not a good idea imo) OR, like another person said, you can simply only sell as many days a week as you are comfortable with to keep your biz running smoothly.

This is what I do, I limit the number of any given listing so that I dont end up with more than I can handle.<br /><br />If someone wants bulk, they can follow the instructions in my profile ;)
