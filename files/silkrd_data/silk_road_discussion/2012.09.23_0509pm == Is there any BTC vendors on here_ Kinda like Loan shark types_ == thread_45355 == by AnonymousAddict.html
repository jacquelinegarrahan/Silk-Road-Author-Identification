				your statement makes no sense<br /><br />if you want coins on tuesday - go buy them on tuesday... using mt gox or whatever service you prefer? if you only want them on tues and not on monday then wait to buy em on tuesday. <br /><br />why are you talking about loans or only wanting coins till the next week? you spend the coins theyre gone... people dont just lend out large sums of money to an anonymous person<br /><br />

				It doesn&#039;t work like that!&nbsp; You CAN but Bitcoins from vendors, and they do charge a percentage.&nbsp; However, they charge the percentage for convenience and anonymity, not as a loan.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can buy a moneypak and trade that for bitcoins.&nbsp; Depending on who you use they will charge you 5-50% for a fee.&nbsp; <br /><br />You are not going to get someone to front you Bitcoins or drugs on Silkroad.&nbsp; This is not the place to be if you are the type of person who has to&nbsp; pawn stuff to buy drugs in real life, or who begs their dealer to front them some product so they can scrounge up enough money to pay them off.&nbsp; This place is expensive.<br /><br />ETA:&nbsp; I have been informed below there are micro loans of a sort....I assume you need to front some type of collateral?

				he wasnt talking about a micro loan...kinda off topic. sounded like it was talking about a large sum for an entire order before he had the money - loan sharking<br /><br />kk was explaining the btc vendor service which i definitely dont recommend! 50 percent fees - what the fuck is that? <br /><br />more like 10 -15 but still use something like bitinstant.com. Do NOT buy btc on SR (or esp the forum...) because there is no protection of escrow. its like with the loan the guy is asking for, as soon as those coins get sent or your money pak code - it is gone forever, theres nothing to ensure they pay you.&nbsp; if you use a legit clearnet site at least you arent gonna get ripped off and pay 5 % for nearly instant coins<br /><br />if someone actually was giving out large loans you know they lost all their money

				Yeah, I thought the OP was talking about someone fronting them around 5-10 BTC to make a purchase, with only the promise to repay?&nbsp; I looked all over the SR listings and I only see offers from vendors to let you give them loans...not the other way around.&nbsp; If that is what PP meant by a &quot;micro loan&quot; then I don&#039;t think that is what the OP wants.&nbsp; He or she wants like a payday advance.

				@KK im very aware of how SR works, i had just read about micro loans and was more interesred into the subject, Yeah this is a mnth old account on the forums but iv made some decent transaction on SR. I useually just use bitinstant seems the simplest form to do it.. Maybe i worded it wrong by saying Loan sharks, but really that is what a micro loan is, and i wouldnt be on here if i was pawing things to buy my drugs or whatever it is u said.. Id no 800$ computer to be typing on. So no need to go rambling bout what a few posts explained and corrected u on, just cause u didnt know about it doesnt mean it isnt going on.. I just read about it myself yesterday thats why i posted to get all the feedbck on the subject not someone telling me i dont know how it works

First of all.. I am the financial backer to the micro loan service. This being said I believe I can choose to loan out any amount of money I see fit. 0.5 BTC or 50 BTC... Just because we are not out openly offering LRAGE loans does not mean they do not exist. <br /><br />the service is listed and yes it does say this is for small loans &lt; 0.5BTC. However, If a power buyer needs a some serious coin to maybe make a large order or a larger one then he/she had expected the coin will be available for that person. it might take a minute to get in touch with blarg who in turn will get in touch with me.. None the less you are wrong and I am right, Just because there is no page for it does not mean it does not exist.<br /><br />LOANS ARE HERE! small, big, medium it does not matter.. what matters is your buying record!

				if that is true, then tell blarghrawr to message me.&nbsp; if he doesnt then you are full of shit. <br /><br />if that was true i am pretty sure you would be able to spell your partners name correctly&nbsp; and you would know he is in stealth mode so you wouldnt tell people to contact him because they cant... you would have provided the listing <br /><br />

I did not think it was anyone&#039;s business to know that I am involved with the &quot;Micro Loan&quot; service but when people come out here and make ridiculous claims, talking out of there asshole&#039;s I felt the need to out myself and set the record straight... Both MM and RNA are banned from the loan service now that I think about it. Please take note of that blarg. Also..I&#039;m happy to hear that trip went well... I have a good hookup over here for that stuff.. maybe one day i&#039;ll send a sample your way.<br /><br />talk to you soon.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				like i care if i am banned. i dont buy drugs i dont have the money to pay for. <br /><br />i honestly did not expect that. way to prove me wrong. i actually find it funny <br /><br />still the whole point was whether AA could get a loan or not.&nbsp; hopefully now he can actually contact blarg which would not have been possible initially

				very interesting. thanks for your reply... <br /><br />i apologize for being mean. and i always try to be respectful... as you would see in the majority of my posts.&nbsp; i just get frustrated actually when people are disrespectful so i become sarcastic and disrespectful back. which i should grow up and not become like them... the first second third just irked me, sounded condescending when the others were just trying to be helpful and figure out whether loans were actually available for AA<br /><br />in this case i was wrong, but the entire time i was asking to be proven wrong. i just come from a science background and if people are making claims without any evidence they are just talking shit to me. i dont think they were ridiculous claims. they were based on the evidence available and i provided sources to back my ridiculous claims. not coming out of my asshole, you shouldnt get so angry with me for just putting forth the available information.&nbsp; <br /><br />also, if you are actually trying to offer these loans/ have people be aware if they need the help - or make money on the interest - it is nearly impossible to figure out you are even offering loans just fyi. couldnt find any thread, just a mention in the no longer active microloan thread from EB but it links to the wrong page<br /><br />oh and i dont think you should take it out on micro, i was the one being a dick. lol

				I was a part of a loaning pool orchestrated by badboy97 in the past. He offered loans with 30 day repayment plans, with interest between 15-40%, if I recall correctly. He even had a website with a ledger that had how much everyone owed, who was repaying it, etc. Personally, I borrowed a couple hundred dollars from it.<br /><br />It was an awesome service, but I believe it&#039;s defunct now. I messaged him and got no response, and his site&#039;s down. I think he was a drug vendor too, so perhaps IRL issues got to him.
