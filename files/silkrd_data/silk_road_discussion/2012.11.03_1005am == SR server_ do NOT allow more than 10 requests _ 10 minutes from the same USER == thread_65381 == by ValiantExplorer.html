				LATER EDIT: ok, not per IP. PER USER. (since we&#039;re using TOR, per IP is irrelevant)<br /><br />This would help a lot with the bandwidth &amp; availability of SR.<br /><br />As far as I understand, there is trouble because a lot of people constantly refresh the SR page, which eats a lot from the service.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how this would be implemented, but I think a 10 requests / 10 minutes limit per IP would allow people to do decent browsing while in the same time everybody would have better service. Why 10 / 10 and not 1 / 1 ? Because some people need to go through 5-10 pages to reach what they need, and they could do that in 1 minute. If you do 1/1 they have to wait 1 minute after each request which is annoying.

				This is by far the worst idea I&#039;ve ever read anywhere for solving any problem. This solution was just so far out there in terms of actually working that I would hope you were on something at the time of thinking it up because this is just awful.

				Ouch. I forgot about that :D. True.<br /><br />Sorry. My bad :(. And no, I&#039;m not on anything :D. Just got enthusiastic about an obviously silly idea and I forgot I was on TOR, LOL.<br /><br />LATER EDIT:<br /><br />Wait a minute. What if the limitation is PER USER?

				I was suggesting yesterday that users should take it upon themselves to limit their own rate of refresh *while the admins implement a solution*.&nbsp; It would help business keep moving for many people if the other people who are logged in but not actually doing anything aren&#039;t eating up resources.<br /><br />But to implement that restriction on the server side would be virtually useless.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a solution, but an arbitrary number assigned to a dynamically changing demand on the servers.&nbsp; The admins are working the problem, I can assure you, as the problem is only a symptom of the enormous success of SR, so it&#039;s in their best interest to put in whatever time necessary (they are getting paid royally for that work).&nbsp; But whatever solution is put in place must be vetted to the fullest degree from a security standpoint, and there are many external, or future unknown factors that will affect the issue.<br /><br />I&#039;m just saying be sensible.&nbsp; I sometimes browse around, with no intention of purchasing anything or doing any kind of activity, so I assume many others do as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s just if I can&#039;t access the site I don&#039;t keep trying all day every day. It&#039;s that behavior that really amplifies the problem.<br /><br />It&#039;s like an involuntary, distributed DoS attack on SR.&nbsp; Most people probalby aren&#039;t aware.
