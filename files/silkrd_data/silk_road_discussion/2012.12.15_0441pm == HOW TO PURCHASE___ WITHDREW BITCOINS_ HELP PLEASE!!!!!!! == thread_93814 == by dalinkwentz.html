				I&#039;m desperately wanting to make my first purchase. After depositing 3.51 bitcoins into my account, I went to make a purchase. For some reason it sent me to my account and told me to withdraw coins. Thinking it would then be placed into my escrow account I made the withdrawal. Now i have 0 funds. Can anyone tell me where my bitcoins went?

				This is a really fucked situation for the OP.. I have never in my time here and money added ever had it take me to a screen to withdraw my coins.. Unless this guy clicked on his account where it was reflecting his amount and saw at the bottom withdraw to account ...................... and then add to account...........&nbsp; but really now im writing there would be no address just sitting there showing but his so OP did it say the ACCOUNT # to send it to? look to see if its still there and go to blockchain..I really dont know what to say on this one...Im glade i dont mess with anywhere or try to get around to the site anyway but the true way, thats what happens ..Sorry for your pretty much lets call it a loss man....It sounds like u got phished and taken..
