				Hey guys.&nbsp; Been looking into the usual stuff but is it really necessary to learn and understand languages like assembly or c to do some fun hacking stuff?.<br />Not all of us oldies have the capabilities to take in all that shit to be honest.&nbsp; So if there is a fun way to get started, let me know!

				It depends what you intend to do? Hacking can be anything from making your cell phone turn on your oven when you&#039;re out shopping to accessing WPA encrypted wireless networks to steal business secrets.<br /><br />Usually there&#039;s plenty of pre-made tools and guides though. You need to have an idea of what you want to achieve first.

				I recommend the &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; series of books for a newbie that want to learn about hacking. Check also this website: http://www.backtrack-linux.org/ this is a penetration testing distribution with the tools you need to get started, if you have no knowledge in Linux start by learning how to use it. For more books go to amazon and type &quot;hacking books&quot; in the search box, you will get many books titles that way. You will have to read books, a lot of them just to learn the basics and how to use the tools in backtrack.. by the way there is three &quot;type&quot; of hackers:<br /><br />White Hat The good one: it&#039;s professional hacking, companies pay you to test the security of their infrastructure. You can&#039;t do all the nasty exploits you want as a white hat you have to follow certain rules (Example: you cannot use a nasty exploit that will make unusable a 5000$ cisco gateway..)<br /><br />Black Hat The bad guy:&nbsp; he do what he want, if he want to build a botnet and stole money from paypal accounts he will do it. Black Hats in general use hacking to make financial profit or sometimes just for fun<br /><br />The last one is a mix of the two: Grey Hat, this one is hard to explain and you will not see it&#039;s reference in all books. A grey hat may do the same things as a black hat but he will not stole money or destroy data on servers, he will hack just to demonstrate the insecurities of a network to the admin, sometimes he will let know his presence with a &quot;I was there&quot; message or something.<br /><br />

				hacking these days can be done without any real knowledge of programming. there are tools such as metasploit that have pre-loaded &#039;attacks&#039; you just point it at the required target and it does its thing. of course metasploit is the whitehat software, which can be used by anyone who wants to hack, there are private black hat exploit kits available too, some have been cracked and torrented. if you are serious you should out in a little legwork and find out the names of these software packages yourself.

				You may want to see the old movie &quot;Hackers&quot; this is based on Kevin Mitnick history. This is an old movie but you must see it just for fun&nbsp; :)<br /><br />BTW: Kevin Mitnick is a security consultant now.

				Okay thanks guys, im going to make notes on everything said here 8)<br />lol @ ManFromHeaven.&nbsp; No worries mate.&nbsp; I didnt say i was unwilling to learn a programming language, just that at my age its a bit tough on the old memory.&nbsp; I would hardly be a script &quot;kiddie&quot; if that were the case!!!

				It depends on why you want to learn &quot;hacking&quot;. Is it just so you can take down websites that you don&#039;t like? (Or something along those lines?) or is it so that you can understand technology on a very deep level? Make technology do what YOU want it to. Things that aren&#039;t &quot;supposed&quot; to be possible?<br /><br />If it&#039;s the former, just read some tutorials on using premade, and easily downloadable tools. You could get up and running in a couple months if you apply yourself. I personally think that&#039;s a waste of time, and a stupid motive, but to each his own.<br /><br />If it&#039;s the later, it will require years of reading and experimenting and programming. You don&#039;t need to learn everything, but at a minimum, I&#039;d say you&#039;d need to learn:<br />How TCP/IP works. (a very deep understanding)<br />A scripting language. Check out Python, it&#039;s powerful, and pretty easy to learn. Or check out Node.js for something a little different and edgy.<br />How encryption works (one-way, symmetric, and asymmetric)<br />An understanding of how base 2 and base 8 (binary and octal) work<br />At least a decent grasp of C (some would say you need to know assembly. I think it&#039;s avoidable for all but the most advanced stuff. It&#039;s interesting in that it&#039;s one of the most simple languages syntactically, but very difficult to do much with)<br />A good understanding of how web applications work<br />A good understanding of the following concepts (cross-site scripting, sql injection, man in the middle attacks)<br /><br /><br />On a side note, I just finished a project so that I can turn on my coffee pot with a text message, and automatically turn on my porch light when I get close to my house. For the later, I use my iPhone&#039;s location service to tell where I am, and then when I get close to my house, it sends a text command to my home control system to turn on the porch light. That&#039;s the kind of &quot;hacking&quot; that I find enjoyable and rewarding.

Things that aren&#039;t &quot;supposed&quot; to be possible?<br /><br />If it&#039;s the former, just read some tutorials on using premade, and easily downloadable tools. You could get up and running in a couple months if you apply yourself. I personally think that&#039;s a waste of time, and a stupid motive, but to each his own.<br /><br />If it&#039;s the later, it will require years of reading and experimenting and programming. You don&#039;t need to learn everything, but at a minimum, I&#039;d say you&#039;d need to learn:<br />How TCP/IP works. (a very deep understanding)<br />A scripting language. Check out Python, it&#039;s powerful, and pretty easy to learn. Or check out Node.js for something a little different and edgy.<br />How encryption works (one-way, symmetric, and asymmetric)<br />An understanding of how base 2 and base 8 (binary and octal) work<br />At least a decent grasp of C (some would say you need to know assembly. I think it&#039;s avoidable for all but the most advanced stuff. It&#039;s interesting in that it&#039;s one of the most simple languages syntactically, but very difficult to do much with)<br />A good understanding of how web applications work<br />A good understanding of the following concepts (cross-site scripting, sql injection, man in the middle attacks)<br /><br /><br />On a side note, I just finished a project so that I can turn on my coffee pot with a text message, and automatically turn on my porch light when I get close to my house. For the later, I use my iPhone&#039;s location service to tell where I am, and then when I get close to my house, it sends a text command to my home control system to turn on the porch light. That&#039;s the kind of &quot;hacking&quot; that I find enjoyable and rewarding.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This pretty much covers it, I&#039;m an IT student and have a small knowledge of hacking but nothing big..Have hacked a couple of things a few years ago but my conscience left me with regret so I left it all behind. If you do wish to learn about hacking I hope it&#039;s for just security purposes.

				Hey guys. just my fucking luck.<br />hackthissite.org are having problems with their registration process.&nbsp; Although they do say they will fix it for you personally if you send them details of your nick, password and secret question.<br />I am not sure if i should do this or just wait until it gets fixed.
