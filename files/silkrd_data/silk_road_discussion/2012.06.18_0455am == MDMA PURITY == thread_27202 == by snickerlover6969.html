				Apparently you can send a sample to dancesafe.org along with some cash and they can test it for you. There is also a thread in Drug Safety on how to wash your own MDMA to purify it. Good luck.

				MDMA has the same characteristics as cocaine in that it is a HCl salt, and its freebase can be obtained removing the HCl molecule. Just as cocaines purity may be approximately measures by doing this ( It is not exact, other things in the sample may freebase/salt as well), the same may be done with MDMA. Anhydrous Acetone can also be used to wash the sample, which will give a very approximate indication of cuts. I believe there are threads on both these procedures on drugs-forum.com. Hope this helps.

				I believe there is much misunderstanding surrounding the question of purity of MDMA, and other drugs.<br /><br />The MDMA, or &quot;molly&quot;, you buy is crystalline MDMA.HCL, which means it consists of molecules of MDMA (CO2C9NH2) that are weakly bonded with HCl molecules to form the hydrochloride salt (CO2C9NH3+:Cl-).<br /><br />If you wanted &quot;pure MDMA&quot; you could have the &quot;freebase&quot; i.e. not bonded with anything to make a salt, but this is not preferred, as salts are far stabler than freebases.<br /><br />Of course, the addition of the HCl makes each molecule heavier, and so you have to have proportionally more to have the same effect.<br /><br />The &quot;84% is pure&quot; notion arises from the fact that in a MDMA:HCl molecule, 84% of the weight is the MDMA, and 16% is the HCl. This is a bandied around number because in a mass spectrometer, where at high energies all the weak bonds get broken, 84% of the mass flying through the machine is MDMA, hence the readout.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve genuinely got 84% MDMA:HCl, throw it away! 16% of other shit is too much! I&#039;ve done some basic chemistry on the mandy I take, and it seems to be upwards of 98% pure MDMA.HCl.<br /><br />tl;dr 84% of a pure MDMA.HCl sample is MDMA

				This is why people on this board rely so much on consensus.&nbsp; If everyone likes it, it&#039;s considered high purity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is far from fool proof.&nbsp; <br /><br />Appearance is another important factor.&nbsp; If the product is crystalline and chunky, it&#039;s one more positive factor to consider.&nbsp; A powdered product seems much more likely to have been cut.&nbsp; Again, far from fool proof, but absent your own GC/MS, you have to use the information available.&nbsp;
