				Hey there guys!&nbsp; Just thought I&#039;d post a little something on here for all the other newbies, like myself, who are getting ready to take the plunge into the world of bitcoins.&nbsp; I know it can be daunting, especially if you are like me and want to make sure you are making the most secure purchase possible.<br /><br />First of all, congrats on figuring out about the site and Tor!&nbsp; While this is a big step, there are many others to take.&nbsp; The most confusing for me was the process of getting bitcoins.&nbsp; It all seemed so complex...so confusing.&nbsp; After actually using them today, I have to say the process is actually pretty easy.&nbsp; Here was my route of getting the bitcoins and moving them to my SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />I made a MtGox account.&nbsp; I set it up with a new email address.&nbsp; (Don&#039;t use Tor if you are going to go to Mt.Gox.)&nbsp; Once my Mt.Gox account was set up, I wanted to check out my available methods of funding my account so I could buy some coins.&nbsp; After reading for a couple of weeks on the forums here on SR as well as on the clearweb, I decided to go with bitinstant.com.&nbsp; My logic behind this was: 1) I don&#039;t need any identification.&nbsp; Just go to Bitinstant, tell them how much you want, give them your mtgox account name and pick one of their banks to make a cash deposit.&nbsp; No ID, nothing.&nbsp; That sounded awesome to me...and the best part is that they send you the funds almost instantly.&nbsp; I was able to check my email and find the Code for my funds, from my smartphone, before I even made it home from the bank.&nbsp; LEGIT!&nbsp; <br /><br />Once you go to Mt.Gox and redeem the code under the Funding Options tab, its a simple few clicks to buy your coin and get them on their way.&nbsp; Once you have the coins, its pretty straightforward from there.&nbsp; Just copy the address for whatever wallet you want to send the coins to.&nbsp; I used BitSpinner, a free app for Android phones that acts as a wallet for your BTC.&nbsp; So, I sent them to my bitspinner address and then went onto Tor, logged into Silk Road, checked my account settings and copied the address for my Silk Road wallet.&nbsp; About an hour later my funds were in my Silk Road wallet and I was able to make my orders.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Like I said, I was overwhelmed at first with all of the security procedures, not to mention the buying and moving Bitcoins.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as bad as it seems.&nbsp; Anyway, there is a ton of information on these forums.&nbsp; I would spend hours just reading up on here, making sure I knew what to do.&nbsp; I suggest you do the same.&nbsp; There are PGP tutorials, a buyers guide...all manner of helpful posts.&nbsp; Most of all, there are people here.&nbsp; Friendly people, who are most likely willing to help you out, as we were all n00bs once upon a time.&nbsp; (I am still a n00b)<br /><br />Anyway, I really just wanted to post on here that I had placed my first couple of orders today!&nbsp; I have been excited about doing it for some time now, and now that I have done it, I feel giddy about the packages coming!&nbsp; I researched a couple of vendors I thought I could trust.&nbsp; Went with Tony and Dolfan.&nbsp; Tony because he sells quantity and Dolfan because he is a USA vendor.&nbsp; Both vendors seem to have great reviews and feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />I want to thank everyone for their help, anytime I had a question it was answered quickly through messages to vendors or by people on the forums.&nbsp; The community here on Silk Road is truly something to be proud of and it seems like they look after their own.&nbsp; An admirable quality in a world filled with scammers and greedy, selfish bastards.&nbsp; So, in closing, cheers Silk Roaders!&nbsp; Wish me luck on my packages arriving!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jiggy

				Congrats on taking the delve into SR!&nbsp; It seems so complicated at first but then I realized how easy it really was.&nbsp; Transfer money to dwolla, send to mtgox, buy bitcoins and send to wallet, then send to SR (extra step there for security).&nbsp; Your method works just as well, but i&#039;m too lazy to want to go out of my way to make a deposit by hand haha.

				Congratulations. All I would suggest, as I do it a similar way, is that you don&#039;t use your regular email with Mt. Gox. You don&#039;t want your dealings there to be tied to you too easily. Set up a Mt. Gox account with a fake name, of course. And get a Tormail account with your SR user name. You have to be on the Tor network to check your Tormail account but it keeps it all more anonymous.

				Yea, I actually have a tormail but because of all the advice I saw about staying away from mtgox with tor, I didn&#039;t wanna set it up with a tormail address. I guess it wouldn&#039;t matter then? Ill keep that in mind. I drained all my BTC out of the MtGox acct today by sending it here so I can always just make a new one. Thanks for the heads up! And thanks for the welcomes! I&#039;m pumped to be a part of this awesome community. !Viva la Revolucion! haha

				Glad to see new and fresh faces (and by faces, I mean usernames) on the SR.<br /><br />A piece of advice from someone who has been here longer than most:&nbsp; Don&#039;t let yourself get complacent.&nbsp; Don&#039;t establish patterns.&nbsp; Be vigilant with your security and your anonymity, because it is all that you have in the end.<br /><br />And also, let me know if you want some awesome Canadian bud for the best price/quality rate going! :)

				I will definitely keep that in mind anarcho. Ill be in the market for some kind bud in the next month. The holiday is coming up ;) and I have a Sublime concert to go to on 4-20. Count on me hitting you up! <br /><br />As for not getting too comfortable. I will keep that it mind as well. I definitely wouldn&#039;t want to get pinched. Especially now that I&#039;ve finally found Mecca.

Gox is that you can&#039;t sign in through the Tor network because that can create big problems when trying to withdraw bc.<br /><br />Welcome to the world&#039;s greatest candy store for adults!

				Went and made a new Mt.Gox account tied to my tormail.&nbsp; Thanks for the heads up. Like I said, I thought about setting it up with the tormail address but since I read so much about staying away from Mt.Gox using Tor, I was apprehensive about using a tormail address.&nbsp; I will be making another BTC purchase in the next couple of days.&nbsp; Im gonna wait for my first couple of packages to arrive before I make another purchase.&nbsp; I think I could see this place becoming a big drain on the weight of my wallet.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12391.msg117613#msg117613">Quote from: TalkingHead on February 18, 2012, 07:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12391.msg116852#msg116852">Quote from: tehjiggy3 on February 18, 2012, 01:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Yea, I actually have a tormail but because of all the advice I saw about staying away from mtgox with tor, I didn&#039;t wanna set it up with a tormail address.
