				Hey all, now I had previous problems with withdrawing btc from SR to another exchange but it seems that problem has fixed, I recently came across an error that I havent had happen yet. Basically btc was in escrow then released ( I see the info in my account history) but I dont see it come up in my account, several transactions after that were released and I recieved all of them, just this one didnt come up. It was a bit over 220 btc so im just concerned, i contacted sr support just waiting on the reply back although the message says read...<br /><br />Anyone else had a problem like this and what happened as a result? thanks
