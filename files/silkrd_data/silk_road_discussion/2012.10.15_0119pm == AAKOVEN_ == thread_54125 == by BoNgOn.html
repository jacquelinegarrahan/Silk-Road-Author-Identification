The only person with no Address is me.. AS I haven&#039;t received the product were having this situation over..<br />Clearly there&#039;s a lot more going on here than what it seems at surface face, I assume as a seller of 1 year, hes fees are very appreciated...<br />Anyway thanks for the Reply.<br /><br />~BoNgOn&quot;<br /><br />

				I will say this, He was supposedly sending me X amount of a product never showed for 2 months I assumed he ripped me off....then another month goes by and I get a letter form custom officials saying they seized X-5 grams of what I was supposed to get...<br /><br />SOOOOO He sent me product but less than what I ordered. but also didnt give two shits about making sure it was packaged well which I think is worse then getting scammed all together cuz now an address is burned..I would of rather he not send me shit so I could stilll use said address. <br /><br />Over all I would avoid him He doesnt give a shit about his customers and just wants your cash

For a few days you spam the forums about vendor being a scammer.<br />2. Then you tell vendor you reported his return address to LE.<br />3. Vendor gets provoked and tells you the same.<br />4. You make one more thread and paste parts of the message that makes you look like a victim.<br />5. SR support checks the facts and tells you to fuck off.<br />6. You play victim some more and accuse SR backing up scamming.<br />7. ?????<br />8. PROFIT!!!<br /><br />Oh, and love how you have his return address and say you never received the package ;D Fucking scum like you is the reason why vendors starts asking to FE in the first place.

I have reported your return address to the L.E.O... =)&quot;<br /><br />They responded to me asking how they could hand over your address when they don&#039;t have it, and to give them a break, implying of course they wouldn&#039;t do that.<br /><br />~SR Support&quot;<br /><br />My reply too that and I presume the end of this topic: <br /><br />&quot;Okay but as a buyer you have no leverage, so my message was a mere attempt too see just what kind of seller he really is. As a last attempt to ever see that product... And how could he not have my address? The only way is if he never sent it at all proving my point he&#039;s a Selective Scammer.. The only person with no Address is me.. AS I haven&#039;t received the product were having this situation over..<br />Clearly there&#039;s a lot more going on here than what it seems at surface face, I assume as a seller of 1 year, hes fees are very appreciated...<br />Anyway thanks for the Reply.<br /><br />~BoNgOn&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, to summarize:<br /><br />1. For a few days you spam the forums about vendor being a scammer.<br />2. Then you tell vendor you reported his return address to LE.<br />3. Vendor gets provoked and tells you the same.<br />4. You make one more thread and paste parts of the message that makes you look like a victim.<br />5. SR support checks the facts and tells you to fuck off.<br />6. You play victim some more and accuse SR backing up scamming.<br />7. ?????<br />8. PROFIT!!!<br /><br />Oh, and love how you have his return address and say you never received the package ;D Fucking scum like you is the reason why vendors starts asking to FE in the first place.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do you have autism? <br /><br />Do I seriously have to explain this.....

				seriously? i dont appreciate you wasting all of our time and make me look like an idiot for wasting SR support&#039;s time as well trying to report this when it was you who instigated the whole situation in the first place<br /><br />like was mentioned, dont just insult a member because they bring up a very valid point - that response claims you sent the return address to the police, and yet you were saying you never received the order so you shouldnt have the return addy... of course youre gonna get a hostile response when you threaten a vendor and your story is full of BS<br /><br />if your order did not arrive thats certainly not the appropriate way to go about dealing with the situation
