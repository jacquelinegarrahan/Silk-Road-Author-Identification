				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Wow, yesterday was quite the day.&nbsp; We shipped a tremendous number of&nbsp; orders and it wasn&#039;t until I volunteered to make a morning run to the Post Office to get out the first batch for Ben (who was neck deep in packing even more) that I found out that Friday was a Post Office holiday and there wouldn&#039;t be any shipping.&nbsp; Luckily nearly everyone got their issues resolved and we were able to ship out almost 100% of the orders on hand.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have made a couple of changes to our operations as a result of observing what kind of things were slowing down operations and causing choke points that prevented us from working at maximum efficiency.&nbsp; Here are two new policies that have been posted on our sellers page that will make *everyone&#039;s* orders get shipped faster at Pharmville:<br /><br />1. Foreign orders-now instead of making each person individually request a quotation for shipping we have simply found that most of the developed countries have shipping costs that are so similar that we could establish standardized shipping costs.&nbsp; We have added these as line items to our listings and our foreign buyers can now order regular or premium shipping just like the domestic buyers and when the time comes to ship their order we simply mark it &quot;in transit&quot; and contact them to finalize.&nbsp; Once they have finalized we ship the order.&nbsp; We have found that after only two days of doing it this way it already has cut the time it takes for a foreign order to ship once it hits our order page from 5 days to 2.&nbsp; Everyone seems happier with this system and we are going to keep it this way.<br /><br />2. Minimum order quantities-while we are not going to institute an overall minimum order, we have some items that we simply can&#039;t afford to ship as onesies and twosies and still make a profit.&nbsp; A Super Special $10 M S Contin 30mg single pill costs $2.51 to ship with a DCN and that&#039;s simply an absurd percentage of the total.&nbsp; So from now on cheaper items or ones that are on sale at a significant discount will have a minimum.&nbsp; On the M S Contin, for example, the minimum is 3 pills, or $30, hardly a bank breaking amount.&nbsp; We think that everyone will be able to live with this change and still be happy with their ability to order.<br /><br />3. Modafinil-is this something that we should carry?&nbsp; I get some people asking me about it but I just don&#039;t know much of anything about it.&nbsp; What does it do?&nbsp; How much should it sell for?&nbsp; Do a lot of people want it?&nbsp; If you are interested in us carrying it, pls send me a pm and help me to get accurately informed about this product and if there&#039;s enough interest we&#039;ll carry it. :)&nbsp; Oh, and we haven&#039;t given up on the stimulants, especially dexedrine and Adderall, it&#039;s just putting together a supply line that will guarantee a 24/7/365 in stock situation takes a little while.&nbsp; If you knew how many months I worked on putting together the old school OC&#039;s pipeline and how many hours it took, you&#039;d get the idea.&nbsp; It&#039;s not something that happens overnight. :D<br /><br />3. None of my business section-this is a section I rarely put in a public post but the situation has gotten so bad that it warrants it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to see two things happen at this Forum.&nbsp; Would someone who has the time, I know I don&#039;t and I know Ben doesn&#039;t either (btw, Ben just got online for the first time this week, his handle here is &quot;JustBen&quot; so if you see him, that&#039;s the Ben of Pharmville.&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he didn&#039;t want me to tell anyone that so this is my nasty little partner prank for the day. ;) ) but someone who has some credibility here needs to start a thread with a sticky where people can report on their dealings with the various BTC exchangers on the SR marketplace who, if the reports my buyers are giving me, are 95% straight up scammers and need to be put to digital death at the earliest possible moment and I would like to request anyone who has been scammed by an exchanger to be ABSOLUTELY SURE to send one, just one, very detailed but forceful pm to SR directly so that he will act swiftly to get rid of these piece of crap fucktards who think it&#039;s fun to steal people&#039;s money when all they&#039;re looking for is an honest service and they&#039;re willing to pay a decent and sometimes even really high price for it.&nbsp; I want these guys GONE and gone for good and the only way to kill a scammer is to starve them to death.&nbsp; And you pranksters, get creative, pummel their pm boxes with thousands of pm&#039;s about honesty and integrity, or even better figure out a scheme to steal all their BTC out of their SR accounts and even their wallets on their computers and then donate them to SR with a note to divide them up among the people who were scammed.&nbsp; I WISH I had the computer skills to do this, I would forgo what little sleep I get every night working until I got these bastards!&nbsp; If someone wants to come to SR to scam MoneyPaks lets send them a MotherfuckerPak instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;Something with a digital bomb in it that goes off and takes out their computer.&nbsp; As the Marines are so fond of saying &quot;kill &#039;em all and let God sort them out&quot;.&nbsp; Ok, rant over but please someone who can and is able, please do something to stop these guys from robbing our customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;It makes me sick to my stomach to think about it.<br /><br />As always we hope everyone is having a great day and is looking forward to a great weekend and some high grade pharma phun phor all!!!<br /><br />much love to all of you,&nbsp; &nbsp;-Alex &amp; Ben-<br />

				I can confirm that the modafinil sells like hotcakes. I got bought some from two different EU sellers to try and to sell to people afraid to order international. HanSolo had absolutely no broken or crushed pills but seems to have disappeared. The other seller I won&#039;t name had a high rate of crushed or broken pills.<br /><br />They sold out way faster than I expected and one buyer asked me if I was getting more and I had to say no. The messed up thing is he acutally has a script for Provigil but can&#039;t afford it at $180 for 30 days supply.<br /><br />I was selling 10 strips for $28 with shipping.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure Pharmville will do well with anything they stock, especially if it is sold here or there is an interest for it. Prescription stimulants like Ritalin and Adderal at sensable prices would fly off the shelves IMHO.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />TUS
