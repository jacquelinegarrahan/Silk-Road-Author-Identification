				HIGH<br />Anyone ever&nbsp; hear the&nbsp; term smurfing?&nbsp; I hear its when someone visits medical cannabis dispensaries and take what they buy there and resell in the black market?<br />Anyone doing it? Is it profitable? What are prices in Colorado dispensaries? <br />ECC

				I&#039;m pretty sure the term smurfing most commonly refers to people purchasing psuedoephedrine for meth production.&nbsp; They run around to multiple stores to acquire it as it&#039;s federally regulated for this reason.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how much this applies anymore since they ID a person and enter your information into a federal database when you make such a purchase.

				I guess either way, they wouldn&#039;t be able to get enough at a time to really make it worth while selling it?&nbsp; I mean a couple a bucks, but nothing special like pounds per week.&nbsp; I think the dispensaries are limited to a few ounces at most at a time.&nbsp; Smurfing it would imply many people going in one after another and putting it all together to make a pound or whatever.&nbsp; But thats&#039; a lot of work for weed.<br /><br />The psedeo-ephedrine thing with decongestant pills is worth it, because a few pills makes a lot of meth in return, so one package per person makes it worth while in the end. Driving tweakers around town from pharmacy to pharmacy waiting in line, each buying one package of sudafed. .like good little smurfs. .&nbsp; hehe&nbsp; &nbsp;But weed at dispensaries?&nbsp; Dunno, I would think its easier and more profitable through a weed dealer or grower direct.<br /><br />

				Yeah, the dispensary thing didn&#039;t really make sense to me, but oh well.<br /><br />Wait, come to think of it, I&#039;ve heard of dispensaries giving out a free joint or two on your first visit and a medical patient I know hit up the 3 or 4 dispensaries in town when she was visiting.&nbsp; She was already coming to town and it only took 20 minutes for her to go around and get a half dozen joints though, so i suppose in that case it might be worth while..&nbsp; I dunno.
