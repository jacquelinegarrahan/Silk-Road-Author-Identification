				These fucking liars..<br /><br />You can&#039;t buy guns on silk road! Ffs, why do they keep trying to act as if you can buy weapons on silk road?<br /><br />WE JUST TAKE DRUGS.. THAT IS IT<br /><br />They are chemicals that affect your consciousness... nothing more.<br /><br />If anyone from the Times happens to be reading this, maybe you should write an article about how cheeseburgers should be made illegal because obesity and diabetes is a massive cost to the NHS and the taxpayer (which it is, much much much much much more than drug abuse).. Or that alcohol and tobacco should be made illegal because of the obvious health risks.. Or that unprotected sex should be illegal because it is easier to get STIs..? <br /><br />You see, you clearly notice that the price of.. FREEDOM sometimes does mean that more people will die due to the choices they make, and that damage will be done to society. But should we make alcohol/tobacco/gambling/unprotected sex/overeating illegal? You don&#039;t even fucking consider it, because you live in a world where those things are commonplace. Do you even give a shit that alcohol/tobacco are infinitely more dangerous than mdma/lsd/weed/mushrooms etc? What if I told you that was literally scientific fucking fact. Don&#039;t believe me, look it up. Do you care? Where&#039;s the times article stating &quot;Many illegal drugs safer than alcohol or tobacco, why is it still a crime&quot;. Or was it never about the ACTUAL cost to society in the first place. You&#039;ve just been taught drugs are bad, so they are, let&#039;s just keep spreading that belief. And on your lunch break you&#039;ll probably have a nice cigarette and after work a couple of pints. Great living in a free society isn&#039;t it? Great being free to do what you want to own body isn&#039;t it? Great not being persecuted and arrested for a choice that harms noone, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Fucking twats.<br />

				Oh look, it&#039;s another poorly written article about Silk Road. I&#039;m starting to see a pattern here. Oh that&#039;s right, both The Sun and The Times are owned by Rupert Murdoch.

The Armory sells weapons, and up until recently, Silk Road carried guns and other weapons. I don&#039;t know what you have against guns, but let&#039;s not pretend that it doesn&#039;t exist.<br /><br />To be quite honest, the article wasn&#039;t poorly written, and was pretty informative, but I still don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything to worry about...yet, other than the fact that there are more and more of these articles being written.

				I&#039;m confused, and maybe this has already been discussed, but won&#039;t this just bring more members to the SR? These articles are basically telling people how to buy drugs easily and relatively safely, as long as you take the necessary precautions. I normally wouldn&#039;t have access to the quality and volume of drugs I have on SR, and is the biggest draw for me. I don&#039;t know, maybe they are so naive to think people wont come after reading an article like that.

				This Times article seems like a shittier version of the very thorough one Gawker did- they even went so far as to steal the &quot;SR is like Amazon.com&quot;. <br /><br />Nothing new here and I doubt anything to worry over.

				Ugh...Some people may be excited about a wave of new customers. Only the way I see it is the more drugs being sold equals less drugs for me. As selfish as this sounds, and don&#039;t get me wrong because I feel like drugs are meant to be shared, but I don&#039;t want the competition. Multiple vendors I&#039;ve been wanting to purchase from are constantly being overwhelmed and running out of supplies before I even get enough funds available.<br /><br />I figure this is just momentarily, at least until most vendors can afford to purchase bigger quantities that is.

				More buyers equals more vendors in the long run as there are more opportunities to make sales. Kinda basic economics there Gary but I doubt you&#039;re that smart since you don&#039;t want to share drugs!
