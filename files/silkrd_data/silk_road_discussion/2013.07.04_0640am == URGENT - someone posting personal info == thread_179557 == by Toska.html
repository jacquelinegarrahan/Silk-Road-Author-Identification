				I have noticed this too, obviously, since every thread has them added on the end. Pretty comprehensive spamming. We need to know what&#039;s going on. A few thoughts:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if this was a vendor going rogue and blackmailing or whatever, it should be fairly easy to narrow down who. Whose customers are these?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if someone has hacked SR, I don&#039;t know, it just doesn&#039;t seem to fit. <br /><br />My personal theory (and this is five minutes after seeing them) is that these are made up personal details which someone is spamming to inspire fear and mistrust,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that it would be a lot easier to spam forums with bullshit addys than it would be to hack address transmission system (presumably the second most secure bit of SR (the first being the bitcoins!)). Plus if you had this kind of info you could do much more useful stuff than spam forums with it<br />Eg: blackmail people by PM.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it would be helpful if someone could say &quot;yes my names on that list&quot; but it seems unlikely they would. (They could create a shill to do so, but this would render their confirmation worthless)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect a FUD attack from either LE or a competitor.

				Hi SR´s!!<br /><br />Wow, that´s a serious impact!!<br /><br />It seems these adresses are real, could sb confirm this (of course not name but street, region,...)?<br />Maybe sb got access to an old pc off a vendor (some names are listed 2-3 times)?<br />Or sb hacked pieces of privnote?<br />That would be really alarming!<br />Could it be, that sb hacked the data transfer of SR, when sending clear delivery-info?<br />Could it be sb who runs an exit-node of TOR?<br /><br />I´m really interested, what´s turning out on that story!<br /><br />@ all (DEALER!! and customer): learn PGP!!!!!!!<br /><br />CAN´T BELIEVE, THAT SOME VENDORS STILL DON´T USE PGP (but privnote); IT SHOULD BE A MUST WHEN CREATING A VENDOR-ACCOUNT!!!

Kinda makes u P NOID! that vendors can sell address&#039;s but really what can that get someone? So what u have someone addy? o r think they do, <br /><br /><br />Other than them using as return addys for the vendors to use, Isnt that bout all they can use thm for? <br /><br />It would surely be the dumbest mistake in the world if someone were to ever Invade my house to rob me, Iv got Cams set up front an back doors, Not to mention Built in gun cabnets full of rifles n shot guns!

				Maybe since the person keeps posting the same addresses over and over again you can set the forum to change anyone who uses the street name to something else and autocorrect the zip code to be all 0000&#039;s.

				Thanks astor, I kinda of figured but not for sure. I have never seen the list and would only recognize if one of the 6 or so addy&#039;s I used were listed.&nbsp; I only used certain combinations of names(spelling very important) with particular adds. Also, only gave each of the combinations to specific vendors.&nbsp; So when a name that was not given to a particular vendor but in fact showed up at one of my addys from that vendor I knew there was a problem(huge). I am in NO WAY a fan of the joolz conspiracy but I have sat on this for a long time wondering, how the fuck could this vendor have a name that I never gave them but used it with another vendor to a different adds show up with a used name to a new location??? ??? And NO I did not confuse who I gave what to. It is a simple formula to follow that insures the info is never mixed. <br /><br />On another note, would it really change anything by using pgp or another type of encryption if it were in fact a vendor selling,posting or whatever? Once it is decrypted for shipping, viola they have it now in plain text to be transferred. Unless I am missing something. Again, it&#039;s only if it&#039;s a vendor I don&#039;t see the protection.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				well there again remains the issue about the tracking info. Happytimes did not ship anything therefore he had no tracking info and also that vendor had charged them .01 btc and threatened them all to FE and everybody did I think and so all those .01&#039;s added up buy I don&#039;t know if they added up to the 130 dollar vendor fee that it was back then I think if it was that long ago. Surely it didn&#039;t amount to 500 bucks

Free samples are generally no indication of what your order will be like anyway, I mean who is going to send out rubbish free samples? the old bait and switch has caught many I&#039;m sure.<br /><br />

				Some people around here like to post what they just ordered or are about to order.&nbsp; Sometime what they&#039;re waiting on.<br />Not a good idea if you use that account for free samples, etc... if this is data mining, and it probably is, they can see you&#039;re waiting for a shipment of something and many times the name of the vendor you ordered from. So you&#039;ve already given them your address... easy warrant right there.
