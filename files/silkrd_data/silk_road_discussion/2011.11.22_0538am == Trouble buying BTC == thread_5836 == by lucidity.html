				Hey all, pretty new here so bear with me. I&#039;ve been researching everything in relation to buying on SR and I&#039;m almost ready to go but I&#039;m having a bit of trouble with getting BTC in Australia. <br /><br />My first question is, would it be safe to buy BTC legitimately(by that I mean, with my real name/address etc), and then funnel the BTC through different ewallets before sending it to SR? Or would that be traceable back to my BTC account on say, mtgox or cryptoxchange?<br /><br />Would it just be safer to make a cash deposit directly to a site like http://spendbitcoins.com/buybitcoinsinaustralia/ (then funnel it through ewallets to SR)?<br /><br />Lastly,&nbsp; if I were to deposit cash directly to spendbitcoins, would the bank (NAB) ask for ID?<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

				you do not have to &quot;funnel&quot; your btc through different wallets. every transaction allready goeas through a huge p2p network and is virtually untrackable, even if you deposit directly from mt.gox to silk road. so yes you can buy btc in your real name and totally be safe. dont worry about it = )

				Im&nbsp; not an expert,&nbsp; but bitcoin is not anonymous. It can be very hard to trace. SR has done a lot by having a built in washer. but every transaction is logged with that big long numbers and letters? If your smart and careful, it can be anonymous, but by itself, its not.

				I strongly recommend using instawallet, then waiting 5 or 6 hours while the coins in your deposit address are sent to someone else.&nbsp; Then forward your coins onto SR.&nbsp; The threat is pretty small either way though.&nbsp; Each time you deposit to SR you generate a new BTC address.&nbsp; Unless SR is compromised by LE there is no one on earth that knows that your deposit address is part of SR.&nbsp; They could see that you had sent your coins from one address to another, but there is no way to tie the destination address to SR.&nbsp; Even knowing this, I still use an ewallet first.

				Thanks all for the responses, you&#039;ve all been very helpful. Could anyone specifically answer my question regarding ID when doing a deposit? I can&#039;t imagine they would ask for one when sending money but I want to make sure before ordering from http://spendbitcoins.com/buybitcoinsinaustralia/

				Nevermind, spoke to the bank directly and ID is not required for a deposit.
