				is it just me or does it seem like many vendors have raised their prices lately?&nbsp; I guess it could be from the way bitcoins have been lately, but it still sucks that the buyers have to take the hit for a volatile btc market.&nbsp; Any one else notice?

				I think most vendors if not all list their prices in dollars and SR converts it to the btc value so if btc rises, the product will cost less btc and if btc falls then it will go higher but it&#039;s still the same amount in $.

				I have a solution, every vendor lowers their prices!!! yay!! that would make many a user happy :)<br /><br />But yes, i have noticed this with most all items, script pills in particular. <br />Maybe the addition of LTC would keep prices more stable as well, im all for price stability and decreasing prices!

				Its also possible that the OP is just dead wrong. And that every poster but one is correct.<br /><br />Prices go up and down...on very few items. Supply and demand is once again showing!&nbsp; The market, YOU THE BUYER, dictates the price on here! Vendors can ask anything they want and you have an option to buy or not. <br /><br />But instead of being a big dummy &quot;OP&quot;. Try and understand if you were a vendor. YOU would want the most you can get where you stay competitive. And you might raise or lower prices based on if you need to sell something right away, you are selling out, your cost that week, other vendors change there prices, and I could go on for 10 more paragraphs.<br /><br />Someone said it is more likely that the vendors take the hit...not the buyer. And the FACT is when the btc is not stable..there is a LOT LESS sales for 90% of the vendors&nbsp; and the other 10% with items that are &quot;recession proof&quot; (or I should say no matter what the btc is doing&nbsp; they are selling AKA PAIN PILLS:) ) so you might see vendors lower their prices to make the buyer be in&nbsp; a position that they must buy it now. <br /><br />Also a lot of these drugs are bought by people that NEED them.. a lot more then the casual user that is like &quot; man..I just want to get high next weekend&quot; I would say those guys account for 5% of sales and 95% are bought from...addicts. Not rec users.<br /><br />Also a lot of the time a person..such as the OP..is noticing something that is only short term...meaning they had there eye on one vnedors 3.5 grams of weed for example...and he sees it for $80....then 2 weeks later the &quot;same&quot; listing is $95. What they are not taking into account is that &quot;item&quot; might have cost the vendor more money that week. Or that item sells out very fast and the demand calls for a higher price...aka SMART BUSINESS!<br /><br />So not forget..we as vendor are here to MAKE MONEY. That is NUMBER ONE. And if you thought about it for 1 second. If you were a seller and not a buyer you would be here to make money. <br /><br />Sorry to the OP that he believes that&nbsp; prices in 2 weeks have gone up...sorry that he does not understand the market price and that vendors are here to make money. Not provide cheap drugs. Though I think it is &quot;smart business&quot; to price your items to move...not sit there. And I have seen vendors that simply do not sell certain items. Or in fact are not even trying to sell an item.(whole other thread)<br /><br />But @OP..it would have been A LOT better if you could have given an example. But you did leave your post open to the fact you could be wrong. You said &quot;is it just me&quot; and &quot;anyone else notice&quot; and you had 1 guy out of the 10 or so say yes and you had the other 90% say no. But the truth is ..since you never said what drug you are talking about..and you made a vague post...you might be 100% correct...markets fluctuate. And all buyers want lower.&nbsp; And maybe you noticed an item that a vendor went higher. I would suggest instead of making a thread, you just spend time looking on SR for a better &quot;deal&quot; for the items you like. I thnk you can always find a good deal or ask a vendor to give you the price from 2 weeks ago. Worst case is a fuck you. Better then your responses in a thread :)

Yet when a $360 order was finalised, I only got $270 because the average weighted price was higher than the actual BTC price. When you get $3,000 or orders finalised that all lose 20% of their value, that is $600 gone. I think a lot of vendors may have raised prices a little to make up for this over the long term. But generally speaking, prices seem fairly stable.

If there is lots of product available, prices drop. When it is scarce the prices go up. Same with Silk Road. <br />If I was one of 60 vendors selling weed on here and suddenly 50 of them disappear, prices are going to go up. Or the cost of the product might be higher for the vendor now. Or they might be running out of stock constantly, so have decided to bump up prices to slow down sales a bit and make higher profits.

You are a fucking idiot. This would imply that the government gives a shit about us, and clearly they don&#039;t. ie &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; come on you dumb ass. If they cared about us and they certainly do not, they would have put a war out on idiots like you and try and educate your tiny brain. Do some fucking research and use some common sense before you make such irresponsible comments. You clearly don&#039;t have a clue what&#039;s going on around the Nation and World for that matter. Fucking addiction being the leading contender to drugs being illegal, what a joke!<br /><br />So your on a drug forum talking about things your don&#039;t have a clue about and professing that your not addicted by any definition of the word. Yea well your not close to the word intelligent either. You fuckers that state &quot;I&#039;m not an addict&quot; are usually the worst peopel out there with the deviant behavior that would make me proud to proclaim I am a drug addict. Like Nixon proclaiming &quot;I&#039;m not a crook!&quot; You are, and your a fucking moron. <br /><br />Let me ask you some things. You know what never mind. Your answer would be as stupid as your comment that the leading contender to drugs being illegal is addiction. What would be the point to read more of your idiotic responses. No thanks douche bag. Go back to the kid forums and droll over the little boys, you fucking deviant..&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to :)

You are a fucking idiot. This would imply that the government gives a shit about us, and clearly they don&#039;t. ie &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; come on you dumb ass. If they cared about us and they certainly do not, they would have put a war out on idiots like you and try and educate your tiny brain. Do some fucking research and use some common sense before you make such irresponsible comments. You clearly don&#039;t have a clue what&#039;s going on around the Nation and World for that matter. Fucking addiction being the leading contender to drugs being illegal, what a joke!<br /><br />So your on a drug forum talking about things your don&#039;t have a clue about and professing that your not addicted by any definition of the word. Yea well your not close to the word intelligent either. You fuckers that state &quot;I&#039;m not an addict&quot; are usually the worst peopel out there with the deviant behavior that would make me proud to proclaim I am a drug addict. Like Nixon proclaiming &quot;I&#039;m not a crook!&quot; You are, and your a fucking moron. <br /><br />Let me ask you some things. You know what never mind. Your answer would be as stupid as your comment that the leading contender to drugs being illegal is addiction. What would be the point to read more of your idiotic responses. No thanks douche bag. Go back to the kid forums and droll over the little boys, you fucking deviant..&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No you do not have that strait, i said for some drugs, addiction is probably part of the reason (possibly a major reason in some cases) they were made illegal. Heroin= addictive ... im not a brainwashed fool who still thinks weed makes black men rape white women, but i am not a nut who thinks no drugs are addictive and anyone who thinks they are is LE or a govt propaganda-fed moron. Heroin was made illegal far before the war on drugs and the Nixon era and addiction played a role in the passing of that legislation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ya wanna have a normal discussion? If so stop acting like a fuck, if not then stop stalking my posts and trying to pick fights. God damn a little courtesy during discussions, its called manors not being a pussy, which is usually the response adolescent boys get when they try and assert themselves. I remember when i was a teen and called everyone a pussy to hide the fact that i was really just an unimportant person, i grew up and became man enough to admit it, you&#039;re clearly either still in your teens (or adolescent years) or just haven&#039;t given up that mentality.
