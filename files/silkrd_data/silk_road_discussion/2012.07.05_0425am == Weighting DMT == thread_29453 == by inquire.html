				General consensus is that 50mg is a good dose for vaporizing DMT. Silly question. How do you measure this. Is it by weight or is it like a 50 mg capsule?<br />Need some advice on best way to measure, thanks. If you use a scale, would also appreciate suggestions

				Usually by scale, but you can always take the amount that would be the surface area of a pencil eraser if you don&#039;t have a sufficient scale. You&#039;re nit going to OD on dmt. The stuff is too damn harsh on your lungs.

				Search for &quot;American Weigh Gemini-20 Portable Milligram Scale&quot; on Amazon.&nbsp; That&#039;s my recommendation of a scale for measuring dmt.<br /><br />But Jiffy&#039;s recommendation works also, if you don&#039;t have a scale.&nbsp; Just use enough that would cover a pencil eraser.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be too far gone, too quickly to od from it .&nbsp; <br /><br />

				As two posters above said, use scales - some can be obtained pretty cheaply.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve already smoked DMT before, you might be able to eyeball the required amount pretty easily, it actually really equals to a tip of a pencil eraser.<br /><br />Stay safe, an OD on DMT can be quite overwhelming and scary if not dangerous to your body, so if unsure, rather use less than more.

				You can&#039;t OD on DMT.<br />Firstly, because you&#039;d not be able to smoke enough to reach the LD50,<br />Secondly, because the LD50 is so high, if you were IV&#039;ing grams, you&#039;d not get to it.<br />Worrying about OD&#039;ing on DMT is just another thing that could make your trip bad.<br /><br />Just calm down, dose up and enjoy your trip. Most importantly, learn from it.<br /><br />If you have any more questions, feel free to PM me, and I will address them to the best of my abilities.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />The Andromeda Group.

I know it&#039;s been awhile, but I wish I&#039;d seen it before today. I kind of &quot;accidentally&quot; IVed DMT for the first time (I wasn&#039;t totally sure if it was DMT or MDMA... you know how it is when you receive multiple, unmarked orders). I sprinkled what I thought was just a tiny bit into the spoon, thinking it&#039;d only be enough to taste it and figure out for sure what it was. Yeah, it fucking blasted me off into space with the force of a goddamn atom bomb. Definitely DMT, definitely DMT... I learned the hard way about dosing, wish I had known you can&#039;t OD off it when I started being gripped by the Fear, thinking I had done way too much and might not make it.<br /><br />I guess that seems to be the rule with most psychedelics: other than maybe LSD and I guess if you count eating the wrong, poisonous mushrooms, most entheogens can&#039;t kill you, they can just merely scare the shit out of you by instantaneously, temporarily killing your ego.
