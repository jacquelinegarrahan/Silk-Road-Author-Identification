				I will be heading abroad in the future with some friends and would love to bring some MDMA to share one evening.&nbsp; I already have the pills (some ST green ?&#039;s) but I&#039;m not sure how I could get them through airport security with no risk.<br /><br />I had some ideas.&nbsp; Putting them in a bottle of ibuprofen or aspirin maybe?&nbsp; Why would anyone check that?&nbsp; A container of mints that I keep on me?&nbsp; Would I be better off putting it in a checked bag instead of a carry-on?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for suggestions.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s not worth the risk of being caught?

				I just always assumed that checked baggage was the way to go.&nbsp; Carry-on baggage isn&#039;t as big so I feel like they can spend more time checking everything.&nbsp; I am tempted to say that they mostly check for explosives etc.&nbsp; I typically put my stuff in an melatonin bottle in my toiletries case which will be in my checked baggage.&nbsp; The container will also be kinda hard to get to.<br /><br />I am pretty sure the TSA is pretty lazy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten those &quot;we&#039;ve checked your baggage&quot; notes in my checked baggage before but I doubt they check very hard or can even test for MDMA on the spot.

				You really have absolutely nothing to worry about! Last week I traveled through several major US airports carrying Coke, MDMA powder, some E&#039;s, Ketamine, 2C-I, 2C-B and some pre-rolled joints. All was in my small carry on case. The airports I used have finished installing full body scanners in all security lanes so I carried nothing on me.<br /><br />So, I&#039;m still here ordering more drugs, what more can I say? Oh, yes I had a rather enjoyable week&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />They didn&#039;t notice anything. As previously mentioned, unless you have huge amounts taking up large amounts of space you should be fine. As Daft Phader mentioned, just pack sensibly e.g. I put the pills and capsules in my vitamin container etc...

				This method allowed me to carry just over an ounce of mushroom on board to Amsterdam for some friends and I.<br /><br />I powdered them and put them into the do-it-yourself gel pill capsules from a vitamin store (I&#039;d recommend powdering your pills and capsulizing them as well if you&#039;ve got colourful tabs with pressed logos).&nbsp; I then bought two bottles of vitamins (two different types).&nbsp; I made sure to remove the paper covering the cap very carefully as to not rip/tear it.<br /><br />I emptied the bottles, put my capsules inside, stuffed the polyfil crap back in the top, and glued the seal back on to make them look as if they were brand new bottles and had never been opened.<br /><br />We didn&#039;t use them all, so I just glued a random piece of paper over the lid and re-capped the bottles for the return trip.&nbsp; I was even searched specifically as they saw by my passport that I had been to Amsterdam.&nbsp; I&#039;d be willing to try it again if the situation calls for it.

				I once folded up an 1/8th into a paper fold, stuck it in the back pocket of a pair of jeans that went into my carry on. When I had arrived at my destination, I opened my luggage and found &quot;the note&quot; where the TSA has searched your bag.

				Funny enough ,,on my return flight .....From a destination thats kinda a drug country....by the time i reached Las Angelos ,I had been through 2 airports ,a 10 plus hour layover at one .I had............over the journey...So even with the eyedrops,i still looked worse for wear.....At customs Los Angelos ...A young officer opened another booth ,and selected me out of line..(i wasn&#039;t next) their were 3 in front of me........Asked me my vacation was ,,,what i did ...Then asked me you went to &quot;blank &quot; country right?... after i had answered all his questions....I said no i went to &quot; this country&quot; ...Ok thank you Sir !! And i was on my way..I guess i looked the part ,but they try to trip you up with the questioning.....If your&nbsp; nervous and say the wrong place ,,,i guess then it may be time for a search........It was just the way he said it...It was abvious tactic to catch a nervous person,carrying weight..

				Bagging weed up real well and putting it in a shampoo container in my checked bag worked twice for me. Just make sure the bag is SEALED. Using more than one would be even better. I went on a cruise once that stopped in Jamaica also. I had like a gram folded up in a piece of paper that I forgot was in my backpack, which was my carry on(I was very young and stupid when this happened.) I got through the airport with no issues and found it when I unpacked at home. It&#039;s definitely easier to get very small quantities of drugs through an airport than most people think. They are mostly looking for people smuggling big shit I think, and like some others said, they are definitely more concerned with explosives than people carrying personal use quantities of drugs.

				Mix them into a bottle of some generic kid&#039;s chewable vitamins.&nbsp; Security isn&#039;t going to take the time to look over every pill in a vitamin bottle and when you get to your destination you can just dump it all on a table and pick the good stuff back out.&nbsp; :)
