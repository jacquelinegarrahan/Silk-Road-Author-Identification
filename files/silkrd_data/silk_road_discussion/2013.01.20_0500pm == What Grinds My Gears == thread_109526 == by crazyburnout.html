				Not necessarily, some people are trustworthy, thats why the comments are important. i have flawless stats and i have finalized early more than once for one reason or another and i have never had any issues whatsoever. its just a bit difficult to tell who can be trusted when people dont update

				People have suggested showing some buyer/reviewer stats. They could still be anonymous, but you could see how long they&#039;ve had an account, and maybe how many purchases they&#039;ve made (perhaps binned, like &lt;10, 10-50, and 50+). That way you could make a better judgement about whether to trust the review.

				I agree. That grinds my gears as well. As does good vendors with good products and good prices who require FE. I&#039;m always like &quot;guess I&#039;m not ordering that.&quot;

				For anyone not aware of it, you don&#039;t have to leave any feedback *at all* when you FE.&nbsp; Just finalize, then navigate away from the feedback page that pops up.&nbsp; You&#039;ll release the coins to the vendor, and can leave the feedback until you actually have something other than &quot;yeah, so, I think it&#039;ll come and be awesome... so like... this order&#039;s gonna be a 6/5, for sure!!!&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve FE&#039;d twice.&nbsp; Er, sorry, 3 times.&nbsp; Twice I was new.&nbsp; Third time the guy required it for a larger listing with express shipping, and I went for it based on the forum feedback.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a package not arrive... until recently.<br /><br />Fucking $20 order, in escrow, and the vendor is ignoring me 14 days after marked as shipped.&nbsp; Figures.
