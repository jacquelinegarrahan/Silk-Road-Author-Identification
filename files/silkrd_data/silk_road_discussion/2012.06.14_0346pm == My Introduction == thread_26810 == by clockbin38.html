				There&#039;s Blizzcoin.com which gives you bitcoins within the hour, they do run out of coins quite fast but they also refill of course :P<br />Intersango.com is nice, will get you your coins within 2-3 days<br /><br />Also there are different vendors here who will give you bitcoins for cash through the mail :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t bother with Mt Gox as they are cunts.

				Well for drugs it depends what you&#039;re in too. If you&#039;re looking for party/stimulant drugs, look no further than Mephedrone, MDMA, Speed or Cocaine. <br />But if you&#039;re looking for Psychedelics there&#039;s really a wide range, varying from 2c-i right through to DMT. But i&#039;m not experienced in psychedelics. so i won&#039;t be too good on giving out any information on them ahah. <br />There is really a huge amount of drugs to choose from, so its quite hard to tell you what to buy/not to buy, because everyone has their own preference when it comes to drugs! ::) Have a little look around the SR and do some research on google to familiarize yourself with drugs and to see what kind of drugs you&#039;d be interested in taking :) <br /><br />and when buying i tend to only buy from venders with 15+ transactions and with good feedback. But when you find out which drugs you&#039;re interested in taking, let us know or look around the forums for feedback and i&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get lots of info and recommendations on who&#039;s product is best.<br />

				fairs, the cannabis on SR is really good! take a look at things like 2c family, LSD, DMT mushrooms etc.. although, unfortunately, LSD is extremely expensive on here :(

				Okay, sadly i&#039;m going to have to wait a while, because i&#039;m having some financial issues right now, but when i get some downtime, and extra money i&#039;ll go ahead and start buying things.&nbsp; And yes I saw the prices of some of the selections of LSD, and that sucks too because that was on the top of my list of Pscychs to try but yeah, patience is a virtue ;D so i&#039;ll wait, and thanks so much for the info.
