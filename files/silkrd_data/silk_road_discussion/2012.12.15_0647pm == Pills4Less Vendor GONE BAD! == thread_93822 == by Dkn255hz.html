				Guys, beware of a vendor named Pills4Less.&nbsp; He has a 100 feedback but has scammed at least 4 people, myself included, out of about $2000 bucks over the past week in bitcoin transactions.&nbsp; His listings primarily consisted of cocaine and vicodin, but I think just in the last 2 weeks he decided to pull this scam and posted listings for bitcoins.&nbsp; He even had the audacity to write &quot;Trust 100% FB Vendor&quot; in the title of his bitcoin listing!&nbsp; Anyway, I sent him $500 and have not gotten a single bitcoin from him.&nbsp; Three other users have also come forward and claimed foul play, one said that he sent $500, another $620, and another said that he sent $800, and Pills4Less did not send a single one of us any of the bitcoins!&nbsp; I reported him to the SR admins so they are aware of it.&nbsp; I just want to give everyone a heads up to put him on their watch list of corrupt vendors.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even leave him poor feedback on the transaction because he went back and cancelled it after he picked up the money!&nbsp; See this thread below where the other guys that got scammed have confirmed all of this.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93334.msg660380

				Weird name... why&#039;d you copy the forum address for it?&nbsp; Just curious.&nbsp; But yeah, don&#039;t ever trust the feedback system.&nbsp; The forums are 100% necessary if you don&#039;t want to get scammed.&nbsp; You have to look up their reputation here every time, or you&#039;re gonna lose your coins sooner or later, I&#039;m afraid.

				Yes, he is in stealth mode now and must be scamming some of his previous customers.
