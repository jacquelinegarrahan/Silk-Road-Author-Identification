				just curious to how much money i could potentially make, does anyone have any refernces to past sales. Also how much of the bitcoin market is involed in the silk road. because as far as i can tell, while there is other legitimate reasons to use bitcoins, the silkroad is the biggest reason out there. What are other major uses for bitcoin

				I can say with almost certainty that the value of the BTC will not rise significantly SOLELY as a result of 4/20. <br /><br />Those who are smart do not buy Bitcoin from exchanges like Mt. Gox or Intersango.. Nope - instead they trade OTC (over the counter). There are zero fees, and there is no market slippage (ie: your transactions do not push up or lower the value of the BTC).<br /><br /><br />Edit &gt; if you feel strongly enough otherwise, go to http://www.bitconica.com&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and take a leveraged long position.

Gox for 10,000 BTC at the price of $4.70 per coin, your position will clear all the &#039;bids&#039; where users have bid more or equal to $4.70 per coin. However, once your large (10,000) BTC order has consumed all of those bids, the new highest bid will be lower than $4.70. As you can see, your &#039;sell&#039; lowered the value of the BTC. This is especially significant if you are unloading say 30,000+ BTC, which some vendors here actually do or if you run a central BTC based business like Zhoutong (Bitcoinica), Yankee /Charlie (BitInstant), or Jered (TradeHill).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18347.msg183884#msg183884">Quote from: chronicpain on April 10, 2012, 03:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Would have to agree with Reseller...

				it wont go up for a sale. when it shot up to 20-30 was after the gawker article when everyone went nuts. since then its been in the press and nothing has happened. a sale is nothing compared to being in the news. a sale is the same people buying a bit more stuff but being in the news is thousands of new customers. I would say the btc market is pretty much dominated by a few players now and as it hits a certain amount a large player will offload enough to keep it from going higher. Hell SR maybe one of those players after this long of operating. say they have 10,000 btc set to auto sell at 5$. the price will never go higher then 5$ unless those 10,000 coins get sold. the market could easily be kept stable by one large player and considering how stable its been lately i would say its controlled. i would say the times of btc speculating are over for now atleast. <br /><br />in other words sr has loads of coins, he sets mt gox account to sell a fuck ton at 5$ and buy a fuck ton at 4.50. it would never go past either of those points. it would be very easy to do and keep btc stable which would help him in the long run. <br /><br />pure speculation of course.

I hope that it goes without saying though that you would not do anything non-anonymous on this site and that if you do buy BTC OTC it would be somewhere on the clearnet where anonymity doesn&#039;t really exist anyway
