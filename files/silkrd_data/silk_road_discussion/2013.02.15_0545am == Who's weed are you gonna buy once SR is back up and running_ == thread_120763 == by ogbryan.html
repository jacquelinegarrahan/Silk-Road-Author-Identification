				Hmm, That Banana Kush sounds like a worthy challenger to my current favorite (Muskabuzz Fleetwood OG Kush). Has anyone here tried both?

				Banana Kush or OG Kush? <br /><br />I&#039;ve been tempted to try the Daily Blessing, but I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s gonna have that &#039;Arg, shoulda bought the Fleetwood&#039; (but it&#039;s likely my next purchase after I test out one of ogbryan&#039;s kushes)

				I&#039;m smoking the Banana OG Kush right now and have more that should be arriving tomorrow. I haven&#039;t tried Muskabuzz yet but I think I might. This Banana&#039;s just too fucking good though, I don&#039;t want to put it down.
