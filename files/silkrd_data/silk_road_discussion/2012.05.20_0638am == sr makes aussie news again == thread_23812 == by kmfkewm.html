They are difficult to trace because people use virtual currencies such as Bitcoins for payment.<br /><br />Australian Crime Commission 2010-11 figures show a big increase in individual drug seizures during the past 10 years, but the size of drug packages confiscated has fallen.<br /><br />ACC chief executive John Lawler said smugglers may be using the postal system more regularly.<br /><br />Australia Post says the issue is out of its hands and while Customs and police are trying to combat the trend, receipts of parcels, express mail and registered items almost doubled from 23.6 million in 2008-09 to 55.8 million in 2010-11.<br /><br />Budget documents for Customs estimate it has resources to inspect 20 million parcels, express mail and registered items and 20 million letters every year up to 2015-16.<br /><br />Australia Post estimates it delivers 20 million items a day.<br /><br />Mr Freelance said drugs usually came in vacuum-sealed odourless mail.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ve used it myself, it works,&quot; he said.<br /><br />ACC executive director Paul Jevtovic said the internet had created a global market for illicit commodities &quot;that exploits anonymity and virtual currencies&quot;.<br /><br />An AFP spokeswoman said it was not an offence to access the website, but it was an offence to attempt to import drugs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Fucking douche, just as bad as the idiots that keep posting on pillreprts in Australia about defqons, speakers and triforces saying &#039;bought from well know Dutch vendor&#039;. As if the feds don&#039;t monitor this stuff and with all the unwanted attention are forced to crack down to make it look like they are actually doing something. The recent AFP operation, cracking down on drugs in the mail is just an example.

				that video always came up with a google search of &#039;silk road drugs&#039; or whatever, and it always pissed me off so much. That CUNT who made it probably used to get beaten n fucked by his dad and always felt worthless, until he realised he could put that shit on youtube and get lots of hits and feel important.

				Loved the way he got pissed off that The Project interviewed an actual PhD on drugs and the internet and didn&#039;t want to interview him.&nbsp; Seems to think of himself as Australia&#039;s SR expert.&nbsp; He&#039;s just a silly little boy and the less attention he gets the better.

				I think we can all agree, we don&#039;t like it when people try to make it public knowledge how to access Silk Road!<br />I was thinking. Maybe WE should flag any videos like this up to YouTube. Tell them to take it down.<br />The best way for our community to grow is by word of mouth. You recommend to your friends, who you know aren&#039;t dickheads. The worst way for us to grow is by mass media attention. I&#039;d hate to see the day when some stupid young kid (15 maybe) ODs from a drug bought on Silk Road. I can see the media shit storm now, crying mother, politicians bleating on about the war on drugs.

				Neat, I&#039;m on the radio!<br /><br />The cops have been cracking down but have only got 20+ arrests? Something tells me this is a non-issue. I will quite happily keep ordering my pleasures from the internet. <br /><br />Go stop some actual crime, please police. Go nab the derros who vandalise the shops near my house, or the terrible drivers that nearly run me over every day. What I put into my body during my time in my house is not your business.

				+1 although those vandals have probably been&nbsp; chroming? and those terrible drivers are probably<br />high as a fucking kite.<br />when we see responsible drug use as a whole,&nbsp; then one can assume they will fuck off prohibition.<br />But sadly I still know more irresponsible users than responsible.. and yes I class jumping in the car after a cone, fucking irresponsible.

				Long and very positive report on RRR - just search RRR Silk Road, podcast of &#039;byteintoit&#039; 16 May, it starts a bit under a third of the way through I think.<br /><br />Or link if ya decide to just trust me:&nbsp; http://rrrfm.libsyn.com/webpage/byte-into-it-16-may-2012<br /><br />I might be biased, but I think RRR listeners are not generally dickheads, so should not be any Project effect from this ::)<br />
