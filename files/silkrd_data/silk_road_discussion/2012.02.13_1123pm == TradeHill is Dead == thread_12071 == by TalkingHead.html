				This can be seen at tradehillblog.com<br /><br />TradeHill suspending trading and returning client funds<br /><br />Posted by jeredkenna in Uncategorized on February 13, 2012<br /><br />::::: Announcement :::::: TradeHill suspending trading and returning client funds.<br /><br />&nbsp;Dear Clients,<br /><br />Effective immediately TradeHill will be shutting down trading / deposits and returning all client funds.<br />Due to increasing regulation TradeHill can not operate in it&#039;s current capacity without proper money transmission licensing. Combined with multiple bank account closures and Paxum&#039;s decision to close all Bitcoin business accounts, we have deemed the best course of action is to halt trading and pursue licensing while raising funds.<br />Everyone at TradeHill has also been working without pay for several months after one of our payment processors removed over $100,000 dollars from our account without notice. We decided to eat this loss instead of passing it on to our customers.<br />We will be focusing on Bitcoin.com and are preparing to release a new site before the end of the month.<br />It has been a pleasure working with the Bitcoin community and look forward to continuing our business in the future. More details to come soon.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Jered Kenna<br />Chief Executive Officer<br />TradeHill <br /><br />Please send all press inquires to:&nbsp; &nbsp;press@tradehill.com

				Cash. This can be done now with e.g. get-bitcoin but is very prone to the same single-point-of-failure problem and what we need is a better distributed system. Some ideas I wrote about here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11112.0

				Yeah, MoneyPak is horribly risky. And cash too, but that is why the rating system exists. If a drop starts stealing money it should get downrated quickly enough. But what can you do, I couldn&#039;t think of a better solution. Also you could hedge your deposits by mailing only small amounts to many different drops, if there were enough you wouldn&#039;t lose much on a rogue drop in this case.

				@Losty- It is easy to fund mt gox with cash using bitinstant. Look in the &quot;funding acct&quot; section on the left side after you sign in to mt gox. Click on the list and then click bitinstant. You can get instructions from there to make a cash deposit into their acct at a local branch. In fact when you give them your zip code they will tell you exactly where to go. You can make the deposit anonymously (aside from the security cams). I deposited my cash at 10am and was purchasing on SR at about 3pm.

				That&#039;s exactly right. And you can choose a branch (Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo) anywhere if you&#039;re concerned with branch cameras. And with a tormail address associated with a Mt. Gox account it&#039;s pretty damn anonymous. The slowest part is waiting for the BC to arrive here.

But funding Paxum from a card wasn&#039;t cheap either and there was a trail left if you didn&#039;t use a prepaid card. Anyway, that&#039;s not even an option anymore.

				Not necessarily true- There are many ways to fund your mt gox acct cheaply and even free. But you have to wait for several days. When you pay bitinstant their 4.5% what you are paying for is the speed of the service. Hence the name- bitinstant. Dwolla, for instance, only charges .25 for each transaction, but you have to wait.

				I like your post, but electronic cash is EXACTLY what the New World Order wants us to have. They are slowly removing cash from circulation. Only 5% of current money in the world is in the form of paper currency. The rest is electronic entries on a bank&#039;s computer. But, the NWO wants us to have an electronic cash that is controlled and issued by their central banks, of course. I don&#039;t think BTC is going anywhere, and imo it will be a an imperative tool in the fight against a global cashless society and their panopticon control grid. WAKE UP! RESISTANCE IS FERTILE!

				I agree. I mean, what do we really know, but the world has much more than SR to worry about with all kinds of terrorists and major drug cartels who want to launder their ill-gotten gains. And I sure hope, yet highly doubt, that there are no SR vendors who work with any of those murderers.
