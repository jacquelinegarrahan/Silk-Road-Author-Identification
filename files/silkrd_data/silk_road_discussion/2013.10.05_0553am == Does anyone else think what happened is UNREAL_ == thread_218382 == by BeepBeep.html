				DPR was some random loser living in AMERICA?<br /><br />DPR wanted to buy cocaine off some vendor? Uh, WHAT? DRP is DPR, he doesnt need cocaine, hes not a drug dealer. He made comission off EVERY SINGLE SALE.<br /><br />Who in their right mind, would organise bulk deals, AS THE OWNER OF THE SITE. They are the #1 target.<br />You would NEVER do that.<br /><br />The Admins here are absolutelly USELESS, we dont even know what happened, we just have apologies.<br />Honestly, what actually happened?<br /><br />HOW CAN A HUMAN FUCK UP SO BADLY?<br /><br />Doesnt this all just sound so wrong?<br /><br />In my opinion every single droplet of this information sounds like bullshit. I am absolutelly furious that the team here ALLOWED this to happen. There was SO much at stake. AMPLE funds.<br /><br />Mods, WHAT CAN YOU CONFIRM HAPPENED? I think this is owed to the community.<br />The story needs to be set before more bullshit is thrown around.

				The story that is fed to us does sound strange. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Maybe parts of it are true, or none of it is true. <br /><br />DPR could have been working for/with the Feds and they burned him. Sacrificial lamb style. Or he trusted the Fed who got him to reveal his identity. <br /><br />I do know the Feds operate by infiltrating the groups they want to take down. Standard procedure, I put nothing past them. We will probably never know the extent of what happened. It is sad, and the fight continues on. This will increase our resolve and we will become smarter and stronger from it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
