				Firstly, great news that the site will be back up soon, this is a relief for everyone.<br /><br />Secondly please spare a thought for the vendors. They will have a shit load of catching up to do, sorting out orders that were affected by the outage. So give them some time to catch up. <br /><br />Manage your expectations guys, things will probably be quite bumpy for the next couple of weeks.

				Well to be honest as a vendor I dont really expect any additional delays once the site is up. Orders placed prior to the downtime will go out quickly and new orders will go out just like they normally would. Actually I expect a decrease in sales due to people not realizing the site is back up and some paranoid and nervous about the downtime.<br /><br />All I&#039;d like to ask is that customers who placed an order prior to the downtime be patient and try not to send messages asking when it will ship. The messages from concerned customers are what will be the biggest headache but eh I dont blame them either.<br /><br />Cheers for your concern!

				Shouldn&#039;t be that bad really. All the orders I had were sent out before it went down and obviously I haven&#039;t gotten any new orders in the meantime.

				Thanks for the thoughtful thread OP.<br /><br />BUT DON&quot;T WAIT TO ORDER!!!<br /><br />We vendors just about lost our minds over this outage and we need your business NOW!<br /><br />Also here is something you can do to help for sure:<br /><br />If you trust your vendor, and they have shipped before, go ahead and finalize right away to get them that cash flow they need to keep the stock flowing.<br /><br />I for one know that after all the down time, my customers will likely not be on the site right away to finalize the orders they already received. Now that means my cash is tied up, so if a different guy finalizes a little early, well that would be a huge blessing for me. Also I ship fast so I was lucky in that all my order got out before the outage. <br /><br />So please -- ORDER AWAY!<br /><br />&nbsp;8) 8)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Modzi<br /><br />(opiate vendor)

				Pfffffff vendors? What have THEY ever done for ME??<br /><br />Just kidding, love you all. I hope you didn&#039;t get hit too hard by this server outrage. Just think of it as a vacation. A really, really stressful vacation. You&#039;ll bounce back soon enough.
