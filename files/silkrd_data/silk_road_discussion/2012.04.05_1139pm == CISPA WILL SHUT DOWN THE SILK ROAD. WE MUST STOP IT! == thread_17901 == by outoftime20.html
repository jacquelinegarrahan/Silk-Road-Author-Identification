				Over 100 Members of Congress are backing a bill (CISPA) that would give private companies and the US government the right to spy on any of us at any time for as long as they want without a warrant. This is the third time the US Congress has tried to attack our Internet freedom. Under the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), if a cyber threat is even suspected, companies we use to access the Internet will have the right to collect information on our activities, share that with the government, refuse to notify us that we are being watched and then use a blanket immunity clause to protect themselves from being sued for violation of privacy or any other illegal action. It&#039;s a crazy destruction of the privacy we all rely on in our everyday emails, Skype chats, web searches and more. But we know that the US Congress is afraid of the world&#039;s response. This is the third time they have tried to rebrand their attempt to attack our Internet freedom and push it through under the radar, each time changing the law&#039;s name and hoping citizens would be asleep at the wheel. Already, Internet rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have condemned the bill for its interference with basic privacy rights -- now it&#039;s time for us to speak out!&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Sign the petition then forward to everyone who uses the Internet: http://www.avaaz.org/en/stop_cispa/?vl<br /><br />Internet freedom faces threats everyday from governments around the world -- but the US is best placed to attack the rights of Internet users because so much of the Net&#039;s infrastructure is located there.

Perhaps they will start watching whoever downloads tor, looks up silk roads url, and if that person becomes a seller they can take down the seller and everyone who buys from them. They will try to find silk roads servers, I don&#039;t know how many back up servers there are but what if there aren&#039;t enough? Allowing the government to track us is not gonna be good for SR, thats for sure.

				Guys this bill will break the internet even worse than SOPA<br /><br />http://rt.com/usa/news/cispa-bill-sopa-internet-175/<br /><br />It&#039;s even more vague than sopa allowing for more surprise attacks and surprisingly stupid government involvement that no one could have expected. <br /><br />They&#039;ll be able to spy on you anywhere anytime and simply say it&#039;s in the name of internet security.<br /><br />Know what this means? If they want, they can, through any third party company you use on your computer, Skype, etc, anything, spy on you. They will gain permission to spy on you through your webcams without your permission.<br /><br />This is literately, The book 1984 happening real time! This must be stopped!

				^ I agree. If they can spy on everything your doing of course you&#039;ll be caught. Anyone looking up silk road will be on a watchlist. They cant just spy on us wtf. I&#039;ve always hated the government. When I was a 13 year old kid they arrested my for playing with fireworks on some companys property near my house. They stuck me in juve for a month and a half. What kind of fucked up government locks up a kid that long?

				And by the way...<br /><br />Being that many of us are &quot;users&quot; of mind expanding substances (especially those who use psychedelics), and have had much of our minds cracked open... my belief is that we are creators. Our thoughts are very powerful. Believe it or not yknow? <br /><br />But it&#039;s my calling to focus on staying &quot;connected&quot; as much as possible and promoting such kind of application towards life. We are changing everything all the time. Focus on staying safe, keeping buyers, sellers, or yourself as a buyer safe, and continue moving forward with the belief that you can contribute to the progression of the planet. <br /><br />It&#039;s entirely wrong for any one to claim jurisdiction/authority over another. We must continue the good fight until global consciousness raises. It&#039;s getting pretty fucked up these days. And for those who just believe in luck, perhaps this shit don&#039;t resonate witchya! To each his own aye? <br /><br />All I&#039;m saying is, WORRY gets you NOWHERE! And can be counter productive in how you make your LIFE CHANGING decisions! And always DENY DENY DENY! If you watch enough COPS shows ALL THEY EVER WANT is a CONFESSION! Don&#039;t crack. NEVER CRACK! Never get into any discussion whatsoever. Refuse. Shut em down. <br /><br />Keep up the education as we continue to move forward!

				Like with all forms of oppression, the US government&#039;s efforts will surely have an antagonistic effect and push more people underground and ultimately against them. The more they lean towards fascism, the more the common body will bend towards liberalism. I think there&#039;s a fine balance with any structure such as theirs and that they are digging they&#039;re own graves. In all of history overbearing govts have never been able to stop us (disrupt, torture, imprison, sure, but not stop) and they never will.&nbsp; I for one intend to continue to do my part in the deconstruction of the world.

				A $2m NAS that is so secret, you managed to learn about it. The feds don&#039;t let you know when they are about to bust your ass -look at TFM. <br /><br />The bill won&#039;t pass. Share the petition with your friends. Not something to freak out over. I don&#039;t want it to pass as much as you don&#039;t, but there is no need to appeal to emotion and be all like, &quot;JUMP ON THIS PETITION RIGHT NOW OR THE FEDS ARE GOING TO HUNTS YOU DOWN LIKE THE NAZI&#039;S AND KILL YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND YOUR PET DOG!!! OMFG!?!?&quot; It&#039;s not realistic.<br /><br />Half the people on here really don&#039;t know shit about internet and/or computer security. If &quot;they&quot; wanted you busted, it would have already happened. Do the math, figure out how much money it costs to post federal law enforcement &amp; surveillance teams. The amount it takes, is not worth the eighth, ounce, or pound a year you buy. They want the top dogs, the guys and gals sending LSD by the gram and MDMA buy the kilo. There are hundreds, if not thousands of private source boards. The only reason they may harass this one is because of how many naive people talk about it online. <br /><br />

				Yes the power that governments are seeking is worrying, but for everyone worried about being tracked for downloading Tor, consider that we aren&#039;t the only users of Tor. According to torproject.org the project was commissioned by the US Naval Research Lab with the purpose of protecting government communications. As I understand it, it&#039;s still used for military communication by spies (and military in general) all over the world. This means that the US military and other international enforcement agencies have a vested interest in keeping the tor network secure and anonymous. So while I worry about the efforts and methods being used by the US gov (and others around the world) to reduce online anonymity and privacy, I take comfort in the knowledge that THEY HAVE SECRETS TOO and Tor network helps them keep secrets just as much as it helps us.<br />So, (to conclude) as long as the correct precautions are taken, we are for the time being, still safe... so you better all be using the TAILS LiveCD to avoid having keyloggers or other compromising software running while your on SR.<br />Peace!

				To the OP:<br /><br />I currently use SR in a number of ways that the government would not approve of as do most of us. In fact one of my first thoughts was about how I was breaking the law. So I went out and bought a prepaid mobile broadband card at the mall for $50 a month.&nbsp; I use a prepaid credit card and pay them. Very similar to the way you would use a prepaid cell phone. How can the government figure out who I am? I would imagine they could figure out my location but I live in a city. For people in the deep country that would mean your caught if they can location you. I feel like urban users of mobile broadband will be more difficult too find even if the location was pinpointed. Without a doubt the police could investigate, check for pictures, ask people in the area about someone using an laptop in a specific place at the time of the violation. <br /><br />Consider: If this law did pass and the right government agency&#039;s felt like it than it will be shut down. Agency&#039;s such as CIA and NSA can do things that are hard to imagine. The CIA did work at the university I attended a few decades ago and it shows displays of things like a tv that&#039;s half inch thick from the 80s, it shows a machine that was meant to see through materials(the machine was not effective for the most part but to this day it can be used to see through the stuff used on scratch off tickets), and a few other complex things. The point is we should all just try too tread lightly. The CIA and the People always say if the government could find Tor sites they would shut down the CP sites. Well guess what the NSA does not investigate child porn for a living. But they do investigate things that involve national security. So people that say the government cant shut down Tor and crack SR just dont realize that anything that is in the way of national security will have experienced highly trained and highly paid people working on a resolution. The military made Tor it would be foolish to think that they didn&#039;t have zero day exploits prior to them sharing it will everyone. <br /><br /><br />

				I doubt this forum and site are hosted in the US so CISPA won&#039;t apply. DPR could have easily bought a dedicated server outside the EU and N America to host and hide these sites. Corporations also can&#039;t spy on Tor.<br /><br />The only reasons these laws are going through is not for crime, it&#039;s because of copyright lawyers. It&#039;s impossible to legislate copyright and intellectual property without installing something on your computer that spies 24/7 to prevent you from breaking copyright law. Nobody cares about online crime, certainly not the American politicians. There isn&#039;t a big enough paying lobby for it compared to the MPAA, RIAA and other criminal predatory industries

There are a lot of important, intelligent african americans in the country with very important jobs. If you say they want to hold the poor/poverty blacks who might riot, then maybe.

				After reading the posts leading up to my reply I have so much to say. Almost everyone who has commented has done so w/o putting much thought into it. Maybe thought was put into them and it is just that a majority of the people here are not that smart. When I hear things about &quot;the government doesn&#039;t have the money to...&quot; . Are you fucking kidding me? In the US we have a company called the Federal Reserve, and for those of you who do not know, it is not federal. These people print money as they see fit. People need to change the paradigm from which they view the world. Just about everything we were ever taught was a lie....a lot of time the things you KNOW to be TRUE are simply not....People are arguing over tech stuff associated with whether Tor would be affected by CISPA or not...Regardless of PGP, GPG, it is naive to think that the government could not see your information if they wanted to. Just this morning on Good Morning America ( I hate mainstream news by the way, caught this in passing) they had a story about terrorists using &quot;hidden&quot; sites online to spread their message. The interesting part was when I heard, &quot; federal agents have the ability to stop and take down sites like these at any time, but do not b/c they are a much more valuable tool when left up, and used to gather information about the individuals who visit the site.&quot; anyone else?
