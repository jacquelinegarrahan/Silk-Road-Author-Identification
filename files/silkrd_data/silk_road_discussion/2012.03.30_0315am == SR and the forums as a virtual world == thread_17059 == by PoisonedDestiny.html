				lately i&#039;ve felt like SR is it&#039;s own little virtual world.&nbsp; the SR site itself is the market, with wares spread out in an open bazaar.&nbsp; the forum is a huge circular area where buyers and sellers mingle and hang out.&nbsp; <br />i find myself hanging out in review forums of a vendor when i await delivery, talking with people.&nbsp; it&#039;s like hanging out in a shop while you wait for your purchase to be wrapped and rung up.<br /><br />meanwhile we have governing squares where we discuss issues affecting our little market.&nbsp; drug safety and advice is given out in a center that provides better drug safety education then any physical place in existance.<br />we harmlessly scuffle and there is drama in our little town.&nbsp; enemies watch us beyond the walls, and roberts and his crew stand watch and protect us against fraud and danger.<br /><br />we are physically locked out.&nbsp; we are all disarmed and helpless to harm each other.&nbsp; fraud is still possible but violence is not.&nbsp; reputation is worn on one&#039;s sleeve.&nbsp; libertarian bliss.<br /><br />if it can work here perhaps it can work out there one day.<br /><br />

				Unfortunately, in my honest opinion, it will never work out &quot;there&quot;. That&#039;s why &quot;here&quot; was created.<br /><br />I do have to agree it IS its on little social network, period.

				You have so eloquently stated my exact feelings since becoming active on SR. It&#039;s a bewilderingly beautiful thing and I think some people here tend to get caught up in the business and lose track of the big picture.

				Yeah I agree with the OP&#039;s sentiments. I&#039;ve always lamented being born in this era for a lot of those reasons, as opposed to living in my romanticized 19th century ideal cowboy frontier land, but I must admit the internet is some cool shit. Drugs too.
