				<br /><br />I still feel a little weary about sending coins to SR.&nbsp; With my luck the ddos would ensue and hundreds of dollars would be in purgatory for god knows how long.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know it is working right now but it was the other day after the first wave of attacks. For 2 days SR was faster than the forums, blazing fast.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just don’t want to tie up my loot and not get my drugs for an eternity. So I ordered from 10toes on the other site, which I will not to be mentioned out of respect for DPR and all his has done for us druggists.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It seemed like the shadiest website.&nbsp; I needed some blow and was sick of waiting so I said fuck it and got $400 in BTC from Bitinstant and was on my way. They automatically change your BTC wallet address after each transfer so don’t freak out like I did when I went to check agter I got home from Cvs.. Both orders I placed were shipped within 3 hours of being placed and I even got some free shit from a vendor. <br /><br />At the end of the day I don’t care where I get my drugs from weather it local, Silkroad or any of the other black market websites.&nbsp; I just want quality for a good price shipped fast.&nbsp; If you can offer me this consistently you will get a lot of my money.&nbsp; <br /><br />Silkroad you were my first love of online hard drugs.&nbsp; I will always love you, I may cheat on you when you’re not around but I will always come back for more when you are.&nbsp; Ill be back when the site can stay online for more than a few days.<br />

				Feeding the troll...<br /><br />First of all, you don&#039;t have to be &quot;liberal&quot; to care about more than just your wallet, there are plenty of conservatives who like things and enjoy stuff.&nbsp; Heck, I even saw a republican say he loved someone once.&nbsp; Not all conservatives are rich, in fact most are not, otherwise there would be nobody to vote republican. (Hard to win an election with 1%)<br /><br />Being born into privilege only gives you two advantages, having the money to do what you want, when you want.<br />It doesn&#039;t make you smart, kind, wise, friendly or well-liked.&nbsp; &nbsp;All that money didn&#039;t teach you how to spell, that&#039;s for sure.<br />When you have money, you will always wonder if your friends, family and ladies really like you, or your cash. (Usually it&#039;s the cash) You can never trust anyone completely, and are surrounded by people who always want to one-up each other.&nbsp; Listen to all the fakes laughs the next time you say a joke.&nbsp; Heck intentionally make up a bad joke, I bet you will still get some laughs.<br /><br />You think people envy you, well sure, they might.&nbsp; What is envy though?&nbsp; Jealousy that someone has something you don&#039;t have, or hasn&#039;t paid the same price (money or labour) for what you have.&nbsp; Wooooo, someone is envious of you.&nbsp; Who cares except you, who needs to believe only envy could explain why you are unliked.<br /><br />Rich people generally are pretty useless if they were born into it.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice and easy to suck their money away in investment scams and drugs.&nbsp; Most people make fun of the rich because they spend their money stupidly, and have major character flaws that normal people don&#039;t have to deal with.&nbsp; The most intelligent rich parent make their kids work for it.&nbsp; Bill Gates kids had a sweet upbringing, but won&#039;t see their daddy&#039;s cash when he&#039;s gone.<br /><br />So, how does it feel to be hated by 99% of your own species just for being born?
