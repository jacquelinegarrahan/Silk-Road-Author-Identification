				Sorry to break it to you crackhead and fellow SR wanderers, but if there is a meaning of life, you wouldn&#039;t be able to figure it out in a loooooong time. Perhaps our universe is a simulation, perhaps there is a far more intelligent creature, perhaps there is a god after all. Who knows?<br />That&#039;s right, not anyone of us.<br /><br />I like LEGACY&#039;s idea of &quot;There is no limit&quot;, because even though it might not be the actual meaning of life, it sure is a good pointer to figure it out.<br /><br />But for the sake of Douglas Adams, I&#039;m obligated to say, 42.

Science takes us back fairly far, but not all the way. I don&#039;t know what lies in between, but I do still know that at the very beginning there was nothing, and then because there was nothing there were no limits and so anything was possible, and then naturally everything began to happen.<br /><br />Why are we here? We&#039;re here for the same reason the universe itself is here. It&#039;s the consciousness of the great nothing imagining away in the lack of both light and darkness. Why are we here? Because eventually, everything will be here or have been here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How can you say that in the beginning there was nothing? I&#039;m sorry, but stating that as a fact or &quot;fundamental truth&quot; is simply madness. What if time is cyclic, what if time isn&#039;t linear, what if you could actually move in time? Let&#039;s say that the universe is a simulation ran on some type of computer for an civilization that is beyond us, that does not exist in out universe but rather everywhere outside it or nowhere we can imagine. Perhaps our 3 dimensions are just a &quot;simple&quot; simulation. They could base the simulation on what we know as quantum chromodynamics, field theory, string theory or something we yet can&#039;t even comprehend. You could then say that they must at some point have initiated the simulation, big bang if you will, but that still does not answer the question whether there is a beginning, as only they would be able to even hint at an answer to that question.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but your logic is terribly flawed and so your knowledge of modern physics.

				This is a very Interesting Thread guys!! I have yet to do any type of drug that makes you Hallucinate etc.. It seems like something im gonna soon try though. I got a bout a Gram of Ket from India sent to me as a sample along with some Xanax but just dont know anything about it or how it makes you feel. It&#039;s in the form of like crystals . How long does it last and what is the feeling like? Iv always been a Opiate user so its never really interested me til lately when iv read about how LSD and others make you have a deeper out look and meaning on life. Any advice would be great and also what would you suggest for someone on a first trip? Iv herd great things about DMT as well. Thnx guys

				Personally Ket is best used IM and not insufflation. You&#039;ll get a warped and trippy experience, just crush it as fine as you can. The trick is the delivery method. To get a good &quot;wave&quot; of effect the delivery has to be efficient. <br /><br />DMT was perfect for a friend of mine. I had already done much acid back in the day and other psych&#039;s plus much mdma so when I hit the first extraction of mimosa that was clear as crystal and gone in the pipe off one huge rip I saw entities. Alien, gnome, searpent kind. Terrence Mckenna Talks about the dmt experience much if you&#039;ll look up dmt revelations on youtube. <br /><br />LSD: Can very likely show you the way. The start of it at least. <br /><br />All drugs imo or most psychs have cycles and change throughout use. I&#039;m the way I am from lsd in many ways, but I shudder at the thought of being in yet another loooong mothafuckin acid trip that kicks my fucking ass. But if you&#039;re a newb... have at it!

What does anything, everything, need to exist? It needs to be possible. It&#039;s the one common prerequisite of all things, not only all which are but all which are possible. And now, as time goes on and more and more emerges in this reality possibility is simultaneously diminished and expanded. Nothing can precede possibility for possibility must precede everything. (Oh lookie there, nothing is allowed to precede possibility, and indeed it did. There was nothing, then anything was possible.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What is impossible is only defined by us. We should say anything is possible, or everything is impossible. That is the two sides of the coin. We cannot say that some things are possible, and some impossible. That is being in two minds. How can we know our limits if we havent even felt anywhere close to our limits as yet. What if our limits are defined only by us?!?!<br /><br />EDIT: I just read the entire thread. Amazed at how some people have mentioned that the answer is that there are no limits ;) Also, why is the marijuana subculture number 420? Coincidences do not exist is what is starting to realize...

				Technically NOTHING was possible at the beginning of the universe until the end of the grand unification (GUT, all 4 forces were unified) epoch, and if you want to split hairs not until the end of the electroweak epoch and beginning of the inflationary epoch ... luckily the electroweak epoch occurred started&nbsp; just 10^-36s after the big bang .. so like, not very much time :D.<br /><br />I&#039;m of course talking about the unfolding of reality this all occurred before any ... thing existed, as in the materialistic reality we exist in (like trees and stars and porn and shit .... stuff that exists physically in reality).<br /><br />That didn&#039;t begin until baryogenesis, the period where the quark epoch, followed by the hadron epoch, followed by the lepton epoch, followed by the photon epoch, followed finally then by the first actual generation of &#039;matter&#039; through nucleosynthesis ... about 3 minutes after the universe began.<br /><br />Then thing&#039;s were possible, because then things existed :D<br /><br />Just saying, ya know :)

				Oh, I will agree with you that at the end everything is impossible because the universe is accelerating, so it will become progressively colder as stars, galaxies, etc. separate from one another to lengths such that light will never be able to reach any one given object from another without it having to take longer then the time the universe has existed for at that time (The Big Chill)&nbsp; hehe

				TL;DR<br /><br />I was just joking around throwing round some cosmological evolution (aka science, not whatever mumbo jumbo you were typing).&nbsp; <br /><br />&#039;All those epochs&#039; occurred in the first SECOND after the universe ... banged, I was just playing fun of that cuz almost nobody knows anything about the mechanics of cosmological evolution and I was bored, and also had just railed a line of Marcel&#039;s K lol.<br /><br />The word you mean is PROBABILITY, not POSSIBILITY.&nbsp; There is a monumental difference when it comes to describing something ... real.<br /><br />For the record, I personally believe in Multiverse Cosmology, our universe was just the lucky one that was capable of retaining stability once supersymmetry was broken, and the 4 forces decoupled, which we&#039;ve yet to figure out how CP violation is even permitted within the physical parameters of our universe.<br /><br />Some people say it&#039;s hogwash to think that we&#039;re just &#039;that lucky&#039; so God must exist.&nbsp; We are &#039;that lucky&#039; because every other universe wasn&#039;t capable of retaining a state of uniform stability upon which complex forms could evolve, so of course we are &#039;that lucky&#039;.&nbsp; We won the lottery, we just never had to buy the lottery ticket because the lottery was drawn spontaneously.<br /><br />You&#039;re welcome to believe whatever you wish, but I personally ... decided to stop reading once you said the word fractal, as if to know what one is and how it would even apply to whatever argument you&#039;re making.&nbsp; I might actually read the entire post of yours just for fun sometime, heh.&nbsp; Sorry i&#039;m a man of science, not mystic lets glue pieces of fancy sounding metaphysics together :P<br />

				In my eyes, the meaning of life is to do whatever makes you happy.<br /><br />Disregard everything that doesn&#039;t make you happy, and lead a life that will bring you joy.<br />
