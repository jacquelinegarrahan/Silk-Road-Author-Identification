				I noticed that when I look at the feedback now, it no longer shows how old the feedback is.<br /><br />Is that intended? That information was extremely helpful.

				Good luck to new sellers if this is how it&#039;s going to be from here on out. Everyone will stick with vendors in the top 10%. (Which is another thing that changed - be cool if you would list vendors by what percentile they are in. ).

				I can&#039;t say I&#039;m liking this.&nbsp; Chronological feedback was much preferred because it allows buyers to see if a seller is turning into a fuck-off, now it&#039;s hit and miss.<br /><br />Take LTTM for example.&nbsp; No new feedback for months and completely different listing types upon &quot;return&quot; (I think the account was sold privately and it&#039;s an entirely new seller), which a buyer could easily see by visiting the vendor page.&nbsp; Now it looks like all of the great reviews are current and many new buyers will be buying from this unproven account using entirely different PGP blocks, and a bunch of people could potentially get burned by a scam.<br /><br />I have no problem with the percentile change in rank that just kicked in, or knocking the max transactions down to 300 again to disguise how much business is done.&nbsp; But randomizing feedback displayed and losing the age of it is going to hurt buyers, especially newbs.

				Damn this sux!&nbsp; WTF?!!&nbsp; Agree with the 300 Max, but I always look to be sure a vendor is &quot;current&quot; on positive transactions.&nbsp; I can not believe this was meant to be.&nbsp; Would SR have instituted without some explanation?&nbsp; After the very positive &quot;fan&quot;, stealth mode, etc....this is a bad move if intended!

				Though, reading Rumor Mill, we&#039;ll be able to tell when a vendor goes south of cheese. Look what happened with HybridMike? Recent feedback was good. Then all of a sudden, he went AWOL. Left a fair number of people caught out there. <br /><br />So feedback isn&#039;t as reliable an indicator as we&#039;d might like to think. Especially with all the &quot;finalizing early for a trusted seller.&quot; Forum feedback tells the real deal more often than not and with better detail. You even have post date and time.

It was like a check and balance system; if one supported the other, it was a pretty safe bet you were dealing with a reputable vendor.<br /><br />I have to admit, I&#039;m not wild about these new changes. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s still a work in progress.

				the feedback is randomized as well making it useless to determine what the status is of a vendors current batch of any given drug..&nbsp; &nbsp;

				What is this? Must be a bug, right? The age gone and only a (random?) selection of the feedback. I can&#039;t see how this is more useful than the old view with chronological feedback.<br /><br />If this is the preferred way of showing feedback, at least give us the option to view all the feedback (chronological, with times).

				I&#039;ll say it: at the very least, not being able to see what feedback is left for which product and the &quot;freshness&quot; of the review is incredibly stupid<br /><br />I can&#039;t see a single upside to this.
