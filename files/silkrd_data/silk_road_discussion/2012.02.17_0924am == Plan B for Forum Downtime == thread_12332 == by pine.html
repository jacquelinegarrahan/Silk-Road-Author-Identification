				The recent downtime could have been more than a little inconvenient if it had carried on for a few weeks. As for it being scheduled, well, it was the first I&#039;d heard of it being scheduled anyway.<br /><br />Any ideas for Plan B? <br /><br />We need some way of contacting each other that isn&#039;t susceptible to attack.

Putting a note up on the SR website would be good too.

				- don&#039;t see pre notice of downtime on silc ..nor anywhere..<br /><br />- don&#039;t see what the negative security / anon issues would be to let everyone before hand aside from traffic....before and after....and is this deliberate to not let anyone use<br />&nbsp; this against SR ie the less you know whats going on behind the scenes the better.....most likely..<br /><br />

				Not comfortable with SILC chat.<br /><br />It&#039;s not about the protocol, but the server. Whoever owns that server has a motivation to sell it to the DEA. <br /><br />Can your client for SILC chat be Torified?<br /><br />

				Also, that solves nothing since it&#039;s a single weak point. By back-up, I&#039;m talking about something LEO cannot possibly take down. e.g. possibly something on clearnet that we communicate through using TOR that can&#039;t be taken down. Something with huge volume like Google Groups, 4chan or Facebook but that isn&#039;t under the control of any one entity.

				Was the downtime actually scheduled?&nbsp; For a while, the page simply refused to load.&nbsp; Sometime later &quot;scheduled maintenance&quot; appeared on the tab title, but the page only said the forums were &quot;down at the moment&quot;.<br /><br />Replacing an entire public forum isn&#039;t really feasible without an entire backup forum, right?&nbsp; Only thing I can think of would be for buyers to contact vendors directly through pm or email, and for vendors to update their pages...&nbsp; Not exactly public, but still keeps things in motion.

				I think all sellers should have backup contact information set up as policy.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone needs mine I posted it on my profile page a while back and also set up a thread with more details and a stronger PGP key that is to be used for alternate contact (for emergencies and OVDB customers).<br /><br />Anarcho47

				Well, if everyone sets up their PGP key with an actual email address at a .onion email like Tormail, all you need to do is just a portable version of your PGP program on a true-crypted flash drive.&nbsp; It&#039;s like carrying a phone book around with you ;)
