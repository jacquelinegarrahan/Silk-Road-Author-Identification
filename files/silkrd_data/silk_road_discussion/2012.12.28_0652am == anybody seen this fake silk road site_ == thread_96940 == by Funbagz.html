				Wow, someone went to a bit of trouble to set all that up - here&#039;s a snippet that&#039;s pretty amusing:<br /><br />...<br />&quot;If you are concerned that your identity may be revealed through delivery, please read our anonymous delivery information page to further understand the precautions we take to guarantee that our customers are not at risk. We have delivered over 15,000 illicit packages, and not one of our buyers has ever been identified.&quot;<br />...<br /><br />Then when you click to the &quot;anonymous delivery information page&quot;, after some convincing to use your home address and not a P.O.Box since they&#039;ve &quot;mastered the art of sending illicit goods via international trade routes yada yada yada&quot;, you&#039;re given this:<br /><br />...<br />&quot;We do not explain our shipping secrets publicly for obvious reasons, but our reputation speaks for itself. &quot;<br />...<br /><br />They&#039;re attempting to harvest addresses as well as bitcoins, and all via email, fuck that shit..<br /><br /><br />
