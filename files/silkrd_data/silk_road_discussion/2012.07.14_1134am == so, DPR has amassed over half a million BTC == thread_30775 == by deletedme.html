				<br /><br />What do you mean would he be ready for the revolution? He&#039;s been leading the revolution this whole time in creating a virtual market out of nothing that props up most of bitcoin&#039;s value. Why shouldn&#039;t he be able to share in the wealth he&#039;s creating?

				sounds great. Like Silk Road is the most popular place to spend bitcoins. The people at bitcointalk should be a bit more appreciative of DPR for driving the price of bitcoins up.

				OP you&#039;re a cunt who&#039;s trying to stir shit. If you want to do that you should drop trow and take a dump in a bowl and get a serving spoon out. <br /><br />1. It&#039;s absolutely no business of anyone&#039;s how much BTC DPR has. So shut the fuck up quick-style. <br /><br />2. You&#039;re a scamming cunt, who gives a shit what you think? Nobody.<br /><br />Locked.
