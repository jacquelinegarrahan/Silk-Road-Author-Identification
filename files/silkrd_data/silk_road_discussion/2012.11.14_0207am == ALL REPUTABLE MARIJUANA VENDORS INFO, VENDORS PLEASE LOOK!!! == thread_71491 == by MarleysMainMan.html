				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just wanted to start a thread where hopefully we can get the majority of reputable Marijuana vendors on SR to list their info in case the Forums go down, I am in no means hoping for that but, we ourselves have a few customers out there that have received their product and need to contact us &quot;hopefully&quot; :)&nbsp; in case it goes down. We ask that all vendors list as much info as you wish so your customers may get a hold of you.<br /><br />&nbsp; We are obviously MarleysMainMan, we have been with Sr for 8mo and currently have a 100% rating.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the link to our review thread:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30010.0<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is our tormail address: MarleysMainMan@tormail.org<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is our PGP:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBE/7euQBCACfA0Hf05ZtwmsuYm5oszpNRJx4H5vNyhUitWmrNSGS4pHFzlV/<br />64xv3a9qpX8njvFQAAEFMNzepRArXsrC0OnZFDfumjYAoPk8IVGb/9GgNVJ1X7AZ<br />xgnLeaw0gzsW9BcA/6FXAsi6um9LoEA1sRAb2NmkqQAZQ/mlVogFvE25XOk1QSFL<br />EYs7oaVQJVkBJNvh8rGcF25pXfhdSqJN4rP7klHm3AFSOEuR6eiz0YnqEZ5eQOAs<br />0cyLdG6FIBMMBuyglnopwPwcIVWQni819AoC1rveBjy2ltU65PFvRtDuraeTmTs8<br />IKzctBPCreSN1ccok3VlprwgryuLFa42Fo/1ABEBAAG0SU1hcmxleXNNYWluTWFu<br />IChLZWVwIG9uIGEgc21va2luIG1lIGJhYnkuLi4pIDxNYXJsZXlzTWFpbk1hbkB0<br />b3JtYWlsLm9yZz6JATgEEwECACIFAk/7euQCGw8GCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMB<br />Ah4BAheAAAoJELMrRUcLqyqgvHgH/1Mrb9Z6C2iROrbNbK4JwN5H0FqzAMhxZkjT<br />9ONXzSGXJhYduTkidathL7TMzEapLQACMCnLZXOC3rPkdC2BVOSBB9OfAsDkbwJ1<br />pyJMGjqBBGN5tPvgArGYsXK86n7X69mcmE2PrhJvycB3yH1vB+28ljjRRzJzoov7<br />rAqlbsCMGczkErqjKon1yGIK2Dc6s/hfGCCmwBb79zbhG9M0FWDABX/3x0upKxy3<br />HoRk2fv3Qxf0U5U7124H+ATuls/aaCMJ7WazfR1WGMixBk09/QHse7bRE0mI/39D<br />80YZ56T+W1R+/IfPnOIVASioDyqdO4AfCMvfIIbKj+0LdQjrQYg=<br />=zYoZ<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />We check our tormail on a nightly basis EST.<br /><br />Thanks for taking part of this fellow vendors...<br /><br />MMM

				Did you know tormail recently had a problem with their domain server in russia and had to change domain providers? bet you didn&#039;t thats why it went from tormail.com to tormail.org. Sorry about that Jeffsandwhich, but it wasn&#039;t our fault, plus i don&#039;t remember any god damn messages on SR? What the fuck is your problem?? Didn&#039;t get your fix lately? Don&#039;t take it out on us, we have a 100% rating for a reason dumbass...<br /><br />Anyways, glad to see everyone taking my thread seriously, seems this community has changed to a bunch of biggots...<br /><br />MMM<br /><br />***Edit****<br />Sorry guys, just pisses me off when people chime in with such negative energy for no reason whatsoever.

				Once again I couldn&#039;t agree with you more shermit, Just wanted to make a thread for buyers to have some sort of back up...As for the escrow thing, well Idk, I guess buyers just need to hope that their long time/trusted vendor posts his info so they can continue doing business with them, otherwise I hope their vendor goes by their store name plus tormail.org. Thanks to the few who took this seriously and I hope we made some sort of legit list for Marijuana customers...<br /><br /><br />MMM

				I&#039;ve ordered from Christy, NorCalKing, and many of the other top weed vendors and never from you. I see what you&#039;re trying to do here, but I don&#039;t need this post to&nbsp; help me contact them without SR and I never felt like I wasn&#039;t appreciated by any of them just cause of their post here. Matter of fact, I had an order open with NorCalKing during the downtime that was fine. But enough of that. I&#039;ve already told you too much about none of your business.<br /><br />&nbsp;I just wanted to say that what you did here is one thing, good for yourself if that&#039;s how you want to handle it.&nbsp; But to call out other vendors as if they give a fuck whether random-ass forum members know how to get in touch with them is crazy. One of the greatest things about them is if you know how to get in touch with them, you&#039;re in. If you need a forum post to figure out how to contact them...well just like they said....it&#039;s probably better that you don&#039;t deal with them anyway.<br /><br />Keep doing you though, just don&#039;t drag no one into it. And keep that 100, I&#039;ll keep my eye open. If I see a strain I like I&#039;ll give you a try ;)

				Today I was made aware of the fact that there is a scammer trying to use my screen name to scam my customers. The screen name looks identical except they used a capital o instead of a zero in the number part of the screen name.&nbsp; As far as I can tell no one fell for this lame attempt to scam, which is good. My pgp key / TorMail email has not changed. I have updated my listings on SR and orders can be placed there.<br /><br />-My accounts weren&#039;t hacked, just someone impersonating me.
