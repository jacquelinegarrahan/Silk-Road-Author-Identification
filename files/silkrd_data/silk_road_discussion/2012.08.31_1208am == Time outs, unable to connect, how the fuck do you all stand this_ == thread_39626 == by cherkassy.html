				Hi, new to the road and forums. I love the idea of the road and how it works, but am I missing something? It seems that silkroad is always timing out, or unable to connect(as well as these forums) and it gets agitating as fuck. I hit refresh possibly every 30 minutes and I&#039;m hit with the same bullshit. I try resetting Tor, as well as the entire computer and my router. So my question is, am I missing something, or are these servers suffering from constant dos attacks?<br /><br />Any feedback appreciated!

				hey guys. this question has been asked a thousand times. if youre having problems logging in, just wait a few minutes and try again. in the meantime, check out the irc chat room and lurk there for a few minutes. if you still cant log in after a few minutes, wait a few more minutes and try again.<br /><br />youre not missing anything here. the tor network has a limited capacity and not everyone can get thru everytime they want. just be patient and try again later. <br /><br />

				The problem is probably not your computer. From what I understand something like 20% of tor servers are unable to connect to silkroad. I just keep clicking use a new identity, and refresh every 15 seconds till i find one that connect sometimes it takes 10 tries before i get one.<br /><br />

				Well SR is up and I&#039;m on it now. Try another tor server.<br /><br /><br />Yes (but with 302 error).... i assume that means the checker cant connect itself.

				There are plenty of TOR servers, and the amount of servers does not seem to be the issue. I find the issue is directly with specific onion&#039;s being blocked. For some reason almost no TOR servers inside the USA, AUS, UK, seem to be able to connect to silkroad. I&#039;m telling you keep hitting USE a new identity and reload SILKROAD, wait about 20 seconds and try again...<br /><br />I set my tor homepage to http://www.checkip.org, and if it even shows a anti drug country i just click new identity.

				its all just part of the package, the true beauty of the site is not in the technical interface it provides but more in the end result, the freedom to be gained here, tor is a complete pain but with out it we would be lost, none of it possible so yeah it can take 30new ids just to load one page and many unable to connects and time outs in the process but where else are you going to be given the freedom thats rightfully yours to start with? i can understand cos sometimes it feels there is a time zone between the reliability of tor and everyday web but what you should be more happy about is the fact you found somewhere to be free and speak freely where you wont be judged and told you are wrong when you know you are right. thats what the site is about its a hole community of people.

				Depends, not really with the standard client, but a lot of tor servers and bot net tor servers use different clients which can.&nbsp; A lot of people who do that do it because they want to block out Pedo shit. There is a much larger tor community then just the drug/black market community, and a lot of people don&#039;t support the silkroad inside the tor network so I could see them setting up the blocking of the silkroad onion, along with the pedo onions. <br /><br />But to be honest I somehow believe its the government forced ISP filters. (that supposedly do not exist in more then 90% of the countries that use them)<br /><br />I for one know i setup an onion and went to use my own tor server, via Time Warner Communications and was unable to access silk road and i tried the pedo servers for shits and giggles and they didnt work either.

				You can purchase from certain vendors, (for me I chose&nbsp; Enter the Matrix), an inexpensive guide on how to speed up your Tor browsing experience. It explains how to tweak the Firefox web browser by adjusting some of the internal settings to maximize it&#039;s performance. I&#039;ve used this for a while now and have found it definitely improves the overall experience by offering a much faster browsing speed which can&#039;t be achieved with a standard Tor connection. Enter the Matrix is a most reputable and friendly vendor and for me, was a safer option to buy it from and a good choice looking back. Have a look around and see what&#039;s available at the moment.

				zen patience<br /><br />true changing identity can find a fast connection to SR, but when its down its down, usually only for 10-20mins be patient and check again after a cuppa and a splif or walk the dog or something, been down a lot lately at random times, buts its nothing new, been this way for over a year now, its a inconvenience sometimes but you get used to it eventually..

				i find some connections work for SR and some work for the forum, its very rare to get a connection that will work for both at the same time, if i have the road running smoothly the forum refuses to load so i have to hit new id and that will make the forum work but the road then gives up, the solution i have found is to use silkroad on my pc and the forum on my laptop, the only issue is sometimes im looking at the wrong screen with the wrong mouse in my hand even though the laptop has a touch pad.

				maybe its time for a url change, not a complete change just a small edit in the random part of the address, cos the reliability of tor seems to depend on the site you are on, some connections work for the forum, and not the site and some times the other way around, but not as often, and if i get a connection that refuses both i try encrypted google and that always comes up no matter what, also if people make donations to torproject.org we will see a big increase in reliability.&nbsp;

I don&#039;t know how DNS resolution works within TOR I assume it being a TCP connection that it is the same.. But my guess&nbsp; would be that maybe there a&nbsp; DDOS attack on the name servers occurring or DNS cache posioning on the DNS servers that point to silk road servers?? This is like pure guess as I have no Idea how TOR works other than tunneling connections through different hosts :/ So I may be completely wrong and its just that too many peeeps are trying to log in at the same time :D But i doubt it... DDOS is my bet.. and I bet its that American cyber defense whatever they call themselves department doing it...

When you see that, switch tabs from advanced to basic on your message log window, you will see that what that is is an application on your computer attempting to connect to the internet, and it can&#039;t because it is not configured for tor. Query scrubbed is what usually occurs whenever you click use a new identity.

				I can only speak for myself and my own PC setup. But since Friday or whenever the troubles began I&#039;ve been able to log onto SR and SR Forums with the usual pre-problems level of difficulty. There are still occasional time-outs - but I&#039;m running both SR and SR Forums concurrently, processing orders, answering messages and posting on the forum - all without pulling out any hair or signs of premature ageing.<br /><br />And yet if I really want to hurt my brain I can easily spend 20 mins trying to log on to SR via Vista with no joy at all, even when regularly changing identities etc. <br /><br />As to learning to dual-boot: Google it or better still look for a Tutorial on YouTube. Shouldn&#039;t take more than 25 min once you&#039;ve watched the video and obtained XP.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; :) :) :)<br />

This is the same as using tor2web. Basically, it is a proxy run by (?!?!?) that connects you to tor onions via the clear web. Fuck that. Unless you already have a vpn and another proxy chain going, I would not risk it.

				Sorry installing XP hasn&#039;t worked for some people.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />BTW I have auto-updates switched off, a couple of service Packs on and the version of Tor Bundle is: &quot;tor-browser-2.2.36-1_en-US.exe&quot;<br /><br />I removed the latest version just in case that was causing problems.<br /><br />Been a week now and I&#039;m easily logging into SR and the SR Forums no problem. (As in no worse than 1 month ago). Not using new identities or anything.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just lucky? But my Vista installation still doesn&#039;t connect at all - or at least I haven&#039;t got the time or the patience to see if it will eventually connect. 25mins is about my limit there...<br /><br />

				introducing the best most in depth tutorial the road has seen yet, this is the fix we have been waiting for, it explains in easy steps how to reconfigure the nodes that Tor uses by not allowing known problem nodes in to circuits it builds and by restricting the entry and exit nodes it uses and not only can you rule out hole counties but also individual nodes. there is also a long list of known nodes that should be excluded like ones run by the FBI and Governments. <br /><br />and do i think people should pay yes because i have spent 3weeks of my life just like Sickgirl has to Writting and researching, there is a postal option on the listing for people who would like to donate to tor and we will convert coins and pass them on. <br />&nbsp;

Refresh every couple minutes, not every 30 seconds. Also, when the screen does pop up I always try to log in right away, in case things time out again. Once you&#039;re on the site I rarely have problems, it just seems to happen on the initial login.
