				I also heard of a vendor who was busted in a place I can&#039;t tell you who might have been involved in something we can&#039;t talk about, but some of you probably know him. So be careful if you have done business with someone I can&#039;t mention. RUN!!!

A lot of European countries, especially in Eastern Europe such as Poland are feeling very left out by the US, and aren&#039;t getting the same support they once were (such as the missile defense shield), meaning toxic Russian influence is begging to spread across Eastern Europe. Americans seem to be very afraid of being &#039;proactive&#039; in their foreign policy because of the negative criticism they got for things such as Iraq and Afghanistan, but actually the world needs the US to be more proactive than ever. We&#039;re currently in a US foreign policy lull, just like we were before WW1 &amp; WW2.

				its amazing, i was having almost the same discussion last night! i totally agree that here in Uk / Europe it feels like the Usa have been giving us the cold shoulder recently even though the UK are still Americas&#039; lapdog. its troublesome how all the uprisings in the middle east continue to fire off; Russia doesnt want to play ball with Syria, ties run deep and i wonder how far there corrupt gangster run world has their claws into the Assad regime.<br /><br />the world DOES need the US to be more proactive than ever ( +1 my friend) the cultural belief of free speech, liberty, personal freedom and relative democracy will always tie the UK to the US, it just shows in times of economic uncertainty how nations keep themselves to themselves and look after number 1... and fail.

It is a common misconception that the United States spends lots of money in foreign aid. That is simply not the case. Foreign Aid is a pittance compared to what we spend on our military.<br /><br />We do it in the United States as well, next to nothing goes to help our most impoverished residents. And when it does, many of the richest tend to complain about it. The way our country treats its most needy, especially its children is criminal and unethical.
