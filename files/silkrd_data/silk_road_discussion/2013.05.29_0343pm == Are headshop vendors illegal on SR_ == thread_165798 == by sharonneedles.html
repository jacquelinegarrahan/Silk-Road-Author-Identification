				Is the selling of non-illegal products illegal to do on Silk Road network? i.e is the selling of legal products on SR permitted under current law, or is the actual act of partaking in SR transactions strictly illegal?<br /><br />Thanks

				My guess would be that selling non illegal products wouldnt be illegal. There would have to be a specified law against SR. They may be able to get you on tax evasion however.

				Probably depends on the country, but I&#039;m guessing no. Here&#039;s another thread about SR legality issues:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159987.0<br /><br />Based on that info, legal items on SR should be legal to buy and sell.<br />

				Not sure - don&#039;t forget that you&#039;re financially supporting (and profiting from) a criminal enterprise by selling here ... so, there&#039;s that.&nbsp; Then again, others know better than I do about this issue.

				It would be very hard to argue that the paraphernalia isn&#039;t for drugs.&nbsp; It is illegal to sell drug paraphernalia in the US.&nbsp; Water pipes, wired rolling papers and pipes with a carb are all illegal to sell under federal law in the US.

				Yeah I&#039;m sure it&#039;s illegal in the sense of tax evasion and there are individual counties/states/cities that outlaw legal substances such as spice, bkMDMA, DOC, bongs/water pipes etc. I&#039;m sure the legal vendors aren&#039;t checking up on the local laws before they send out their packages.

				&#039;According to the Federal Drug Paraphernalia Statute, 21 USC 863, which is part of the Controlled Substances Act, in the USA it is illegal to sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia as defined. Possession is usually illegal under State law. The law gives specific guidance on determining what constitutes drug paraphernalia. Many states have also enacted their own laws prohibiting drug paraphernalia.&#039;<br /><br />&quot;Drug paraphernalia is a term used, often with a slightly negative connotation due to its use in criminal law field e.g. &quot;possession of drug paraphernalia&quot;, to denote any equipment, product, or material that is modified for making, using, or concealing drugs, typically for recreational purposes. Drugs such as cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine are related to a wide range of paraphernalia. Paraphernalia generally falls into two categories including user-specific products and dealer-specific products.&quot;<br /><br />pulled from wiki.

				It does not become drug paraphernalia until a drug has been used in it. That is in the USA. The you have to leave the residue on the pipes or what not. Trust me, when I was a kid I got a glass pipe confiscated. Otherwise all the paraphernalia is considered to be used with a legal purpose. Tobacco, snuff, and incenses. They make snorter tubes for coke and what not and call it a snuff tube. And it is legal to sell all of those items in the USA.

				Obviously there is a major loophole. All the headshops near me do not sell any items that are not meant for tobacco. If you are in the headshop and say the word bong you get kicked out. Otherwise they will get closed down. It is completely legal to smoke a water pipe with tobacco. Water pipes would not be able to be sold unless for this one reason. And completely legal to smoke wired rolling papers. That law that a poster stated does not definitely distinguish that it must be bought in context of using illicit drugs with. Only when used in conjuction with illicit material does it make it illegal to buy or sell. Otherwise they can ship as many water pipes as you want. I used to manage a headshop.

				Actually if you sold spice at any of the head shops around me you would get shut down. Head shops where I am are strictly for tobacco purposes.

				It is not legal to sell drug-related or drug-enterprise-related items to drug users/dealers. Aiding in on ongoing criminal enterprise can hold very serious consequences; even just participating (i.e. being the close friend/girlfriend/family member of a dealer whom you know to be actively operating) can have you end up in a state penitentiary. Any way you slice it this place is not legal. Now, does the USPS get prosecuted because they sold stamps used to transport (and actually, themselves, unknowingly transported!) narcotics? No! Why? Because the gov doesn&#039;t want to hurt itself. If you were, however, a private citizen transporter (i.e. your friend said &quot;here&#039;s a box of flowers take it to my mom&#039;s house&quot;) of narcotics you could be looking at several years! Such is the game the LE plays. They could prosecute all the stores you spent your &quot;dirty&quot; money at too, technically, but they&#039;d rather just fuck up the lives of private citizens. It&#039;s less messy that way, and the average private citizen can&#039;t do anything about it, which is even better.

				I think its primarily a tax/customs thing. I recall reading a bit about cigarette/tobacco vendors on here having issues getting stuff to certain countries based on tax-related criteria. <br /><br />Personally I think its all bullshit, the concept of a sales tax to me is a serious infringement many people overlook honestly just sends more money to &quot;the man.&quot;

I don&#039;t think it is actually logically correct, though. If that logic held, any brick-n-mortar business on the same street as an illegal headshop business would be found to be illegal. After all, that furniture store sells short tables perfect for placing in front of a couch for bongs to sit on... And they set up that furniture store here because they knew drug users would buy short tables and couches for their illegal drug use.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m going overboard a bit in my interpretation, just like LE would. And, yes, most american judges would take the side of LE. That does not make their interpretation correct.<br /><br />I do think it is possible to have a legal business here. I agree LE will argue otherwise if it fits their desires. What you say and how you sell your products, that is where the legal vs illegal intent is likely to be found. A lot of glass blowers around here got busted for selling accross state lines a few years ago. Before that a bunch of Indoor-grow-equipment stores got shut down as well.<br />I believe they all got busted for how they sold products and educated customers. Undercovers came in and asked store employees how to use their products for something illegal: If they answered, they got busted and shut down and... <br />Now indoor-grow stores flourish and I bet the laws are the same now as then. To stay legal, you have to be legal and not intentionally help anyone break the law. I think that can be done here on SR. Depending on the product, though, it may not be easy or for the relaxed and helpful sort of person. Eternal vigilence against scamming undercover LE claiming they need advice could be a difficult challenge.

				Thanks for the thoughtful responses. There are many replies about it being illegal relative to the country (i.e. the US) but this could be tweeded out by selecting to do business with countries where these issues do not arise (whether you advertise it for tobacco or whatever).<br /><br />So it seems to me that the tax evasion is the only issue. I think it would be funny, and would be a media headline, for a headshop/ entrepreneur to apply for a business license in their country to sell legal items on SR. My guess is this would only work in Spain or Czech Republic or something. Still, very interesting if someone did this for the larf.
