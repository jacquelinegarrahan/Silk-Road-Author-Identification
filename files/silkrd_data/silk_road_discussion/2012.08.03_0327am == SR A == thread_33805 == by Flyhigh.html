				I brought this up under technical support. My funds should have been here 6 hours ago. Many have had the same problem today. SR Support isn&#039;t answering the messages. In the last 4 months, I&#039;ve made about 10-15 deposits that took an average of 2 hours each at the most. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on.

				Yes this has happened to me to, I have been waiting for over 8 hours for two separate transactions from one SR account to another. Nothing has come through yet. This makes me a bit worried. I have never had this problem before, usually only takes a couple hours max.

				I noticed this as well although I think it may no be SR. I also sent a small (less than .01 BTC) transaction to my regular BTC wallet. Usually a small transaction like that makes it way quickly to my wallet, but it&#039;s been over an hour and a half already.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been waiting on a large transaction for over 10 hours now.

				18 hours since I transferred some bitcoins to the BTC address associated with my SR account and blockchain.info shows they reached it (the BTC address) with several confirmations.&nbsp; Last time I tried transferring funds I had forgotten to renew my BTC address (which is supposed to be single use?), waited 5 days, then SR support resolved it directly. This time, I did renew my BTC address, and was hoping the transfer would happen within a few hours... alas this does not appear to be the case! However, I am still confident that SR support will eventually be able to resolve this as they have done previously, it&#039;s just a matter of being patient.....

				I have the same problem. I sent a message to support 14 hours ago, and still no answer or bitcoins. I am also unable to access my forum account, however that is probably unrelated. My coins have also been moved into the tumbling system (or so I assume), and that transaction has more than a 100 confirmations already.<br /><br />I have a theory that the SR staff might be deliberately holding back the funds until the bitcoin drops in value, because of all the sellers that have bound their prices to the dollar (which is already quiet low). The last few days the bitcoin has been very unstable (apparently DPR also recently bound the bitcoin to 9$ because it was fluctuation wildly due to a hacker attack at MtGox or something like that, however this seems to have been lifted, even though the current exchange rate is still not completely up to date), so transferring your bitcoins and buying at the correct time can give you a nice discount - some sellers might not be too happy about that.

				They just came back. The history shows a deposit, then a deduction in the same amount, and then put back about a half an hour later. So the fix is probably still being worked out. So if this happens to anyone else, I guess it will resolve itself.
