				Firstly, it&#039;s only right that i give an update on what has been happening since i posted the last thread. I log into SR last night and the bitcoins were in my account, and i get an email from UK Pharma rather pissed about my last thread which i have asked the mods to delete, as i cannot because i had deleted my last forum account under this name, because i was genuinly convinced that my identity was compromised and was trying to delete tracks, i even mailed dread pirate roberts to delete my SR account because i was convinced i was about to be busted. All i can say in my defense is that if anyone had of atleast contacted me about any kind of delay then all of this could have been avoided. If you advertise bitcoins that day an then ignore me for 4 days, and then another member of SR says the same happened to him, then what am i supposed to think. My logic was it was best to spread the word so others wouldnt get had. It also looked bad that btcoin.co.uk went offline and UK Pharma removed the bitcoin listing and i was getting no responses from anyone. It is all a clusterfuck of confusion but please, i take no pride in saying that mistakes were made on my part, i should have waited loner before posting, but in my eyes i bought bitcoins an was supposed to get them that day and i didnt. It was a mistake and i appologise wholeheartedly. so to reiterate&nbsp; &nbsp;UK PHARMA AND BTCOIN.CO.UK ARE LEGITIMATE AND HONEST IT WAS JUST MY BAD LUCK THAT THERE WAS A DELAY WHICH I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THAT MADE ME REGARD THIS AS A SCAM SO PLEASE IGNORE MY PREVIOUS BAD REVIEWS, IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.

				That may be your impression understandably but that is not the case. UK PHARMA is legit and im trying to make up for a mistake i made. He isnt selling coins now anyway because of this an check his feedback its 100% the fault is mine not his.

				Im talking about it because i made a mistake in calling him out, and A MAN faces up to his mistakes. However by your logic, his 100% feedback must be wrong because one person made a mistake in saying otherwise. Perfect logic genius.

				&nbsp;;D<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if you have actually read the relevant thread which this particular topic stemmed from?<br /><br />Personally, I had made two successful orders for bitcoins from the vendor in question.<br />&nbsp;Once through the btcoin.co.uk site and once by messaging the vendor directly through SR.<br />Both orders were successful and If you read my initial feedback in the original thread, I explained the benefits and potential risks of using that particular service.<br /><br />The link should you wish to make an informed contribution to this thread, is below.<br />Once you have gained a full understanding of the topic we are discussing, why not pop back and share with us your thoughts...<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=75114.0<br /><br />Cheers, 12<br /><br />

				UK Pharma, although understandably pissed off, has been a gentleman about this entire thing. I now hang my head in shame at making such rash accusations and have learned a rather humiliating public lesson. I should of known by his 100% positive feedback that it was me who was wrong and should have been more patient before slinging damaging accusations at him. Its not fair that he now is taking away a greatly needed uk bitcoin service because of me. I let down myself and everyone on the forum by my rash behaviour. Shuffler.
