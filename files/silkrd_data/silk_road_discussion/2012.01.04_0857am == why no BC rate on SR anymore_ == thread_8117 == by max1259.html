				Logged on the other day only to find out that the useful little BitCoin rate tracker from the bottom of the page on SR has vanished,who&#039;s bright idea was that then? Always found that really useful for knowing if i should spend or hang on to the coins,i know we can check elsewhere but it was really handy.<br />Come on SR,put it back please

				If the exchange rate was taken with another unrelated Tor client instance, it will be completely anonymous against mtgoxlive. The worst the exchange rate source can do is give arbitrary large number, so you can order a pound of weed for 0.01 BTC if it&#039;s pegged to USD instead of BTC.

				I&#039;m no cryptography expert, so maybe I&#039;m missing something, but is there some really obvious reason that having the BTC to Dollar rate was unsecure.

				Who cares what the reason is!&nbsp; this is a place to buy and sell illegal things on the internet!&nbsp; if SR says it has to go for security reasons, then it has to go!&nbsp; i would rather be slightly inconvenienced than have SR take unnecessary security risks.<br /><br />no offense to anyone in particular, but i really don&#039;t understand the sense of entitlement so many people around here have.&nbsp; everyone should quit bitching so much.

				Yeah i liked it there too, but have to trust SR knows whats up, all you have to do is go to mtgoxlive.com and there it is, not that complicated. bookmark it! one click, how hard is that?

				With many of the sellers hedged, it didn&#039;t really matter all that much to see a live BTC exchange rate. <br /><br />Since the sellers I use tend to be hedged, when I want to buy $200 worth of stuff, I knew I&#039;d be getting X amount of that stuff for $200. There was one time when I had BTC in my account and it increased in value such that I could get a little more stuff. That was nice. :) Heh.

				It was very insecure. It meant, someone connected to Silk Road has had their IP logged in Mtgox Live&#039;s database. Let&#039;s hope it wasn&#039;t the server. Fortunately, there would be hundreds of IP addresses so . . . it&#039;s not the end of the road.
