				Well, they have the &quot;report this vendor&quot; button now. <br /><br />Did you FE?&nbsp; SR cant do much when buyers FE but if you didnt FE you can get your coins back in the resolution center. <br /><br />It might be a good new year resoluiton not FE for anyone, or no FE for new vendors.

				You are absoluely right...i did FE...the first time after 300 transactions.......my fault......but approx. 110 did the same and believe me they get nothing in return from this seller.<br /><br />But.....SR has to install preventive steps to not let that happen anymore.....enough scams the past year &gt;:(

				Im guilty also, tony 76 got me for about 100$, nothing compared to some of the others losses here.&nbsp; It sucks that buyers, myself included, have to be burned first hand on FE before swearing it off forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR is working to combat the scams IMO.&nbsp; They recently raised the vendor account to 500$ and they put in the report this vendor button.&nbsp; The scams make people not want to shop here, and that is not good for DPR&#039;s buisness.&nbsp; I think he is highly motivated to get rid of the scammers.&nbsp;

				Guys on the order page it says releasing funds is final as a warning that you have now taken the responsibility from them to yourself.<br /><br /><br />I never finalize and any one that I know that has ever never fe has never been scammed.<br /><br />If the vendor must have a FE then you really don&#039;t need to give the vendor your business, just wait a day or two and usually the same product will pop up under a different vendor with the escrow insurance.

				Hey guys, I feel like a damn fool. I got jipped by Taer (dealer supposedly from Mexico) about $500. Then I got jipped by Phd1 about $700. The money I had paid is hard earned cash and I am bloody new to SR and it just hurts. I complained to SR but they say once finalized they can&#039;t do anything. I asked them to make the dealers pay a high amount of money when becoming a dealer. This would stop anyone risking scamming because they will have a lot to loose and also scrap F E. no goods no money that&#039;s the way it should be. But man I&#039;m pissed. No more F.E from me

				I only FE for Asylum (DMT), FrankMathews (MDMA&amp;Coke), XTCEXRPESS and Symbiosis, and that&#039;s only because they have earned it!<br /><br />If you&#039;re a n00b and buying shit requiring FE, I would make sure the vendor in question is established and recommended by the SR community on the forums.

				He&#039;s been demoted for blatant scamming. Thanks to the new report feature we were able to stop him.&nbsp; Granted, I wish it could have been earlier, but we do out best. I agree with Nomad. Please don&#039;t FE with anyone. For the moment its still not against the rules, I bet one day that will change. Its best to get into the habit of not FE and 99 percent of buyers issues will&nbsp; go away...<br /><br /><br />~Flush

I&#039;d love to know just how many noobs have read the SR Buyer&#039;s Guide and actually clicked on DPR&#039;s &quot;a few words&quot;, found at the top R.H.S of the SR Homepage, where one of the 3 main points he makes is to Never Finalize Early. The forum is littered each day with people complaining about how a vendor has scammed them. What&#039;s not getting through to these people is they were only scammed due to their own actions, by releasing payment to a vendor without receiving their order.You alone are personally responsible for facilitating an opportunity for the vendor to scam you. It&#039;s not SR&#039;s fault, it&#039;s your fault. Follow the advise of nomad and you will be fine. As he points out, he doesn&#039;t know anyone who hasn&#039;t FE and been scammed. That&#039;s a category I fall into, having never FE and thus, have never been scammed! <br />P.S - CheshireCat, Your playing with fire by suggesting a vendor has earned the right to expect you to FE. Each to his own, but once you pay, there is no recourse available to you should a problem arise. Many vendors have started off well, gaining the trust of some buyers and building a reputation within the community. It only takes one problem to derail a vendor and send his business spiraling out of control. If you have FE for him, your chances of getting any coin back are miniscule at best. Stay in Escrow and don&#039;t fall victim to any vendor excuses.
