				Who&#039;s the best person to order from that has good product, and fast shipping? I had ordered from The Pharmacy, but I don&#039;t feel like waiting any longer for my item. I don&#039;t want to call it a lose, but I refuse to go another weekend without product....Shipping is horrendous, and it seems like he decided to be legit to many, and scam a few on the way. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s 100% true, but from the looks of the mixed reviews, it seems like something is going on.....<br /><br /><br />If anyone would recc a good vendor, as I said with good product and very fast shipping, so I can get it before the weekend....:/ WESTCOASTFX is out for right now so don&#039;t say him :(((((<br /><br /><br />Yes I know I know everyone uses him too :)

				I&#039;ve had great experiences with a couple domestic weed vendors. NorCalKing, Cali4niaLove, and MarleysMainMan. All great product and fast shipping. I think the first two are located on the West coast, while MMM is on the East, which might matter for shipping time. I would purchase from either of these vendors at the drop of a hat.

				I&#039;ve had entirely good experiences with the vendors I&#039;ve used so far, however WestCoastRX and MidwestMedical have stood out as exceptional in terms of professionalism, quality, and overall value.<br /><br />Can&#039;t go wrong with LexiSadie or TheEmeraldTriangle either.

				I had a great experience with anonymart.&nbsp; Ordered some Lemon Skunk.&nbsp; Good smoke and shipping was pretty quick too, though not as fast as some orders.&nbsp; Overall, it was a good experience, and they were certainly very friendly during the entire process.&nbsp; Decent prices too, for the quality of service and product...some might consider it a bit high, but I felt find paying what I did.

				NorCalKing hands down.&nbsp; Ordered two 1/8ths on a Saturday, got all the way from California to Midwest USA by Monday morning!&nbsp; Holy fuck.&nbsp; His prices may be a little high, particularly the shipping, but his weed has been a consistent favorite of mine and my friends.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the only other ones I can currently recommend are both waiting for crop...JackBlue and freeside.&nbsp; But if they ever come back, check them out!&nbsp; Dank buds, super creative packaging, and very fast shipping.&nbsp; I just decided to try out PuffBuddy, so we&#039;ll see how that goes.
