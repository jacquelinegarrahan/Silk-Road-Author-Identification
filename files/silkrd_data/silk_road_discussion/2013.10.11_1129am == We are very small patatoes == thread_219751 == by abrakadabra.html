				they claim over 2.5yrs in operation, SR has total of $1.2 billion which actually is way less since they added up all total Btc and multiplied by today&#039;s exchange rates but what about the first yr or so where the coin value was much much less??<br />&nbsp;anyway even if it was $1 billion for 2.5 years, the global drug trade is estimated to be like over 300billion per year, we are just a little tiny speck, a small fraction of 1%.<br />&nbsp; hey say the annual global illegal drug trade gross is more then the total GDP (gross domestic product) of 88% of the countries in the world.
