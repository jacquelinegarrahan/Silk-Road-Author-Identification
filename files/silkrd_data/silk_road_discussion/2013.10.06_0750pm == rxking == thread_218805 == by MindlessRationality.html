				First, Infinite Source, it is you that is mad ;D Your are very mad at yourself, and no one blames you. You are just a total reject and total loser. We are all shocked that you have not killed yourself yet. Though it is hard to kill yourself with Meth.<br />&nbsp; <br />I hammered you on purpose earlier just to get you going as it was a little slow around here today. It worked<br /><br />Now I will admit that this post of yours made me a little mad!!<br /><br />As I have no fucking clue what you are even talking about!! What is Doxxed your nob ass bro mean? Then you say I had a reject seed to 4chain???? <br /><br />You are still so stupid.&nbsp; you think you actually have personal information on me.That shows everyone just how STUPID you are. It is why you lost your vendor account, Because you are so stupid. You lost your vendor account and all your coins because you were dumb and you lied about a DCN. And of course because myself and Heatfan decided to shut you down. We thought that you were just to dumb to have a vendor account. So between watching playoff games and snaking. Heatfan and I shut your vendor account off. And you cried and cried and we laughed and laughed.<br /><br />Much like today. We just laugh over you. And we own you. You have nothing on either one of us and you know it. And you are just a guy that is forced to let older men blow you so you can score Meth.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />LOL How in the fuck could I be mad when you are not even speaking English.

				And you see that we do not get our accounts shut down as we are not lying scumbags like you are.<br />We have exposed you for the lowlife scumball you are.<br />We got your vendor account swooped up. With 6k in btc, all gone :)<br />We got to listen to you beg and cry for your account back. LOL.&nbsp; How that was all your money yada yada yada.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Basically we just laughed at you and your misfortune. Bad things happen to bad people. YOU prove that.HAHA<br /><br /><br />Maybe Heat can post one of your messages when you were crying and begging for the Mods to be nice to you and to give back your account(DENIED).&nbsp; After you read this.Just realize that the truth is too strong and you are too much of a loser to say anything that has any merit at all.
