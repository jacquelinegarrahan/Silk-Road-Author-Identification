				I know there are threads about it, but I am so bothered by this update which I have just noticed that I have to make my own thread about it.&nbsp; As a vendor, and a buyer, I am outraged. <br /><br />First of all... the rating number system? Anything below a perfect 5/5 should mean the vendor fucked up. 4/5 is worth suggesting? If the product comes as is described in the listing, then a 5/5 is warranted. Anything less, to the degree at which the fuck up is, would warrant a 4/5 or less. Good vendors scores should be reflected by the accuracy to which their product and services match up to how they describe them.... NOT whether or not the buyers were satisfied. Any buyer can buy something they think sounds appealing, get exactly what was described in the listing, and not be satisfied with it. Feedback should reflect the vendors promised services/products and how well they fulfilled the purchase agreement, NOT the buyers satisfaction. Imagine some asshole leaving a 2/5 on some mexican dirt weed they bought because they didn&#039;t like how it smoked, yet it was described exactly as described in the listing? See the issue?<br /><br />I just finalized and order and noticed I didn&#039;t get an option to lead a verbal feedback? What? The actual fuck? Does this mean there will never be verbal feedback left on listings? How the fuck am I supposed to know if what I am buying is as described by the vendor? Why does it seem like reviewing a purchase is optional now? I just noticed after I finalized, to leave verbal feedback on the item I had to go out of my way to do it? Why? What&#039;s the purpose of this? Leaving verbal feedback on an item should be REQUIRED. This is what makes SR great. The ability to see a constant and up to date review on the vendors product.<br /><br />There is one thing I like. The discussion option. Though, I am not so sure about allowing people who have never bought from a vendor to leave a discussion. At least when people leave their discussion feedback, it should state near their name the things they have purchased from the vendor, or whether or not they have purchased from that vendor at all. It would be extremely easy for a buyer to extort a vendor by going to discussion pages and talking shit about items they have never bought. It needs to be made to either display a persons purchase history with that vendor when they leave a discussion, or prevent people who haven&#039;t purchased that particular item, or from that vendor at all, from leaving discussion feedback. With the freedom in this feature, there is WAY too much room for abuse by assholes. Even if someone has good purchase states overall, they could go to a vendors page they&#039;ve never purchased from and talk shit in the discussion and mislead potential buyers with lies. Bad bad bad.<br /><br />If I am wrong about anything please correct me. I look at this new system and I see a million ways to exploit and abuse it for malicious intent, and that is absolutely horrible. <br /><br />As a vendor, and a buyer for over 2 years, here is my advice: Bring back the old feedback system. Leave the discussion options, yet require a persons purchase history for that vendor to be displayed under discussion stats if they are going to have the ability to discuss on any item that vendor has. This is to prevent lies from being spread with the discussion feature. And wtf, bring back the vendor # rating of 0-100. Seriously. If a vendor is honest in their product descriptions and fulfills their end of the agreement they deserve a perfect rating for every transaction, as well as a 100 rating score. This doesn&#039;t need to be complicated. Feedback should not be based on whether or not a customer is satisfied because often times people are too nit-picky and opinionated. Feedback SHOULD be based on whether or not a vendor fulfilled their end of the agreement in a timely manner, for that is what matters.<br />

				I haven&#039;t seen the new feedback system so I can&#039;t comment on that.&nbsp; But your suggestion regarding showing purchase history with discussions... =|&nbsp; I dunno how SR works internally but I really, really hope that they don&#039;t retain records of order history.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they have to for a short period to handle disputes, but it seems like it would be bad for everyone involved if they kept them any longer.&nbsp; And if they DO retain those records, I at least don&#039;t want my SR handle associated with buyer for anyone to see.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather the relationship stay between me and the buyer, and SR only long enough to facilitate and mediate.<br /><br />I like the way it worked last time I looked, which is that you leave feedback at the time of closing the order.&nbsp; This way in the near future SR can expunge the order while still letting confirmed buyers provide feedback.<br /><br />Of course, for all I know SR stores all kinds of stuff they shouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; Who knows.

				If you have an account it shows your purchase history in terms of what you have spent and the feedbacks you have left, meaning it keeps records of everything really. <br /><br />All that would need to be done with the discussion stuff is to rather instead of showing what items a certain person has purchased from a vendor, show how much they have spent with that vendor. Regardless, it doesn&#039;t matter what is shown since the users name is not shown. <br /><br />SR alows you to use an Alias different from your account name when leaving feedback discussion.<br /><br />SR is ultimately changing things that don&#039;t need to be changed, for some reason. It&#039;s one thing to add new features to improve usability. It&#039;s another thing to modify things that are working perfectly fine. Don&#039;t change the things that work. Add things that can be useful without modifying what already exist....

You can leave verbal feedback. There should be a button that says click here to leave a review or something. Otherwise I think you can click recent orders and leave a review<br /><br />2. With regards to the discussion it is similar to the forum, you don;t know if the buyer actually purchased the item or not. What you suggest would not be possible due to privacy concerns. That is why it gives you a range for the buyer stats so you can judge if it is a shill account or something legit.<br /><br />The new feedback system is actually amazing. The only concern I have is that you cannot see who left what feedback, and that leaving a verbal review is harder then it should be (clearly because you thought it was removed all together)
