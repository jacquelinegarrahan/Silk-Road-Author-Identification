				Hi,<br /><br />It is a long long time since I deposited anything into my SR account (I have had lots of funds in my account and haven&#039;t needed to).<br /><br />So I was surprised to read the following message:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Warning: Read this before making a deposit to your account<br /><br />Your PIN is required to make purchases, withdraw funds from your account, and make important changes to your account. If you forget your PIN, or give it away to a phishing site impersonating Silk Road, any funds you deposit to your account will be irretreivable.<br /><br />Before depositing any funds, you should change your PIN and password on your SETTINGS page. If you are unable to change them because you&#039;ve already forgotten them, you must create a new account and try again.<br /><br />Once you are ready, send your deposit to this address:<br />(address here)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What&#039;s this about? I am very happy with my current password and PIN. They&#039;re secure and I am not going to get phished anytime soon as I know the URLs and type them by hand when I access the marketplace or the forums. Do I really have to change my PW and PIN? What&#039;s going to happen if I ignore the warning and deposit funds to the address mentioned?<br /><br />Confused!&nbsp; Any advice appreciated.<br /><br />FB24<br /><br />

				Looks like the page you get before you&#039;ve transferred anything into your account.&nbsp; <br /><br />So it&#039;s like your account is new again.&nbsp; If I understand you have to click make a deposit to even see your btc address and then you get to this page.&nbsp; Once you transfer funds in it will go back to displaying your btc address right on your account page like it normally does.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can only guess the account has been inactive so long and maybe had a 0 balance? So it reverted to this?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know for sure though.&nbsp; If you have concerns you could always message support and make sure there isn&#039;t anything up with your account.

				I know for sure I haven&#039;t been phished. I log in regularly, and have done several transactions flawlessly over the past month.<br /><br />I bet it&#039;s just that because no BTC have gone into my account for a long time, I&#039;m getting a standard &quot;be safe&quot; type of message.<br /><br />Fuck it, I&#039;m not going to change my PW or PIN. They are as safe as houses. I&#039;m going to transfer BTC into the account using the address given and see what happens.

				DPR made a statement a while back about this change. It&#039;s not a phishing scam, and if your password and pin are secure, I&#039;d say ignore it.

				This isn&#039;t a phishing scam - this is what it looks like when you haven&#039;t made a deposit into your account.&nbsp; This is normal and how it should look!&nbsp; You can ignore the warning if your PIN and password are already strong - it&#039;s just another reminder to people that they need to make sure the password and PIN protecting their account are secure.

				its probably a good idea to change your pass and pin regularly. i do, and they seem to get longer and longer each time. <br />i&#039;m kind of paranoid tho

My BTC went into my account just fine.<br /><br />I&#039;d add one thing to what scout said - see the bold addition above. There must be a timer on it. I have made many deposits into my account before, they were just several months ago, not recently.

				Yes, there is a timer. If you go on for some time without making deposits the address resets like it was the first time you make a deposit. It is written in the wiki IIRC.<br /><br />IMO it is a good security practice in case someone steal your account or something similar.
