			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve been thinking about becoming a drop shipper in my country but I was wondering if this is OK in Silkroad&#039;s and the vendors eyes.<br /><br />Most people in my country never heard about Tor and probably will never hear about it, but there&#039;s definitely a huge market out there that can use Silkroads services. My idea is to offer drugs on the web surface, I would explain my clients only about the shipping method and how it works but never about Tor or Silkroad at all, then I would ask my clients to set up bitcoin accounts on mtgox and then deposit them in my Silkroad account, then buy from the vendors here, ask them to ship to my client&#039;s address and keep a small profit from myself.<br /><br />I think this is a win-win situation for the sellers, myself and my clients. I just don&#039;t know if this is fine for Silkroads policies and if the sellers would not have any problem with an account buying drugs for dozens of different addresses.<br /><br />There&#039;s definitely a huge business opportunity for this safe and anonymous services in my country. In this country if you want drugs you have to get connections with very bad people, people who would even rob you instead of selling you or would kidnap you if they think you have a lot of money. People from the middle class and upper class have a hard time buying drugs because they have to get in contact with a very dangerous underworld in dangerous neighborhoods and with dangerous people, offering this service definitely has huge future and I think I would be the pioneer of this. This could even be useful for &quot;important&quot; people who need to protect their reputation.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Doesn&#039;t sound too bad to me. I&#039;m sure quite a few people do what you do here. Although they buy product and sell to make more profit. <br /><br />Dank

				If you are planning on doing this for your friends, just tell them to put the money into your bank account and then take care of the BTC yourself. That way, there will be little questions re BTC etc.&nbsp; Only do it that way if you trust your friends 100%

				2 problems I can see acter thinking about it for 1 minute.<br /><br />1. Your clearnet website will be traceable to you, in some way, but even if you can avoid that the second problem is more of a concern.<br /><br />2. You have no way to determine whether delivery was successful. If your client says it doesn&#039;t arrive butthe vendor says it did, the vendor wants paying but your client does t want to pay you. You really open yOurself up to being scammed.<br /><br />On the upside the actual risk for you is minimal as you would never come into contact with the drugs. The profit margin is likely to be significant. And successful deliveries are likely to result in a lot of return custom from your clients.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned you should just list products and respective local prices and then you deal with the BTC and access to the Silk Road market, never mention BTC or Tor for your own operational security.

				A lot of vendors here buy from here also!<br /><br />But if you buy a product it is yours to do with as you wish.<br /><br />If you can sort people quality and make a buck, that is how every good business starts.<br /><br />But - why ask?<br /><br />Morally speaking you done nothing wrong. If you buy ten crates of coca cola and sell 9 and get one free for yourself its called trade.<br /><br />If you order then you risk losing out. Charging a profit is acceptable in this case.<br /><br />Be safe.<br /><br />PS I put friends onto SR but have bought and sold on. And ended up with free drugs.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Its win win all round if you sell quality and save people from being ripped off or worse poisoned.

Gotta work it out as how many hours you need to work to get your drug and things wouldnt seem so bad i guess

				Yeah Lim, but the exchange rate sucks balls, thats is equivalet to about £7 or £8 an hour, so better than the UK min wage but not massively. Of course your aussie dollars go further than your british pounds but not when it comes to drugs. Weed is the only reasonably priced drug you can get.
