Sorry if that means nothing to you, lol.<br /><br />Welcome to SR. Enjoy your stay, and do your research on vendors.<br /><br />You&#039;re probably going to have some vendors asking you to finalize early for being new, but there are a couple of ways to avoid this:<br /><br />1. Buy around five things on SR, like eBooks, to build up your transaction count.<br />2. Show that you know what you&#039;re doing to the vendor.

I use cash deposit =&gt; bitcoin to email, go to CVS, and pay with the MoneyGram slip provided during the whole process at BitInstant. There are other stores that use MoneyGram too, like 7-11 Walmart.<br /><br />As for the karma, ignore it. It means absolutely nothing. People +1 or -1 according to their opinion, and as you already know, you can&#039;t please everyone.

Not just because its me selling it either. :)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/657cdb2c8b<br /><br />I think im going to make this book its own thread..its that cool.<br />

				Thanks for the welcome <br /><br />,I have made only one purchase on topix ,it arrived but its not worth the bother I dont think .The place seems a shit hole full of people trying to rip each other off ! I can`t be doing with that .I want to be able to trust who I am buying from&nbsp; and it seems topix is not the place to be trusting.I have been looking about a bit on SR and some of the products look amazing quality if the vendor is truthful in what there advertising .

Just because a vendor doesn&#039;t have a (100) net to their name doesnt mean they are not a good vendor, and vice versa. Don&#039;t blindly buy anything off a guy just cause he got a (100).<br /><br />Look at the product, and actually READ the feedback..make sure its not all just:<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;FE for the most awesome vendor who I never bought from and will probably rip me off..but I don&#039;t know it yet!&quot;<br /><br />All else fails - search the forum for the product and vendor...still can not really find anything reliable, then make a post on the forum asking other buyers who may have bought from that vendor.<br /><br />...You&#039;ll be fine. Keep your eyes open, but its not as bad as topix (looks) anyway. :)

				forum is the best place to find whether a vendor is legit or not<br /><br />sometimes they can have fake feedback stats on their Vendor page.<br /><br />&nbsp;Oh and dw about karma, any karma is good negative or positive. It means your opinion is being heard
