				Hey all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been around for a while but this account is new.<br /><br />I sell surveillance/counter-surveillance gear, hardware encryption, and all sorts of consumer electronics. My suppliers are solid so if you have any requests, lets here them! I can also do laptops, digital cameras, pretty much anything you can think of, if the demand is there.<br /><br />I have no FE policy, everything stays in escrow. I intend to widen the base of SRs wares and get this marketplace kicking!<br /><br />Questions/comments/requests?<br /><br />etg

				I came to the forums just now to explicitly request an electronics item, so I hope you can help.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to request a reasonably-priced milligram scale. Lots of the products on the road require a high degree of dosing accuracy, and most of the easily-available commercial scales don&#039;t do resolution beyond 0.1g. I think that lots of SR users would appreciate someone who could consistently provide a digital scale with a resolution of .001g.&nbsp; I understand that if you&#039;re looking for a super-accurate milligram scale, it&#039;s going to be expensive, but i&#039;m only really looking for something that allows me to measure 2C-B doses (18-25mg) with an accurace somewhere in the range of +/-3mg.&nbsp; I think that something in the $100 price range would be reasonable, and highly popular.<br /><br />It would be fun to buy something not illegal on SR, also, just so that we can convince ourselves that there actually is a legitimate legal use for BTC. Also,a scale is one of those grey-area items like pipes or a capsule-maker, that while entirely legal, we might prefer not to have on our credit-card reciepts. And since we&#039;re already ordering the drugs on SR, it would be a convenient one-stop-shop.<br /><br />I hope you&#039;re the guy to help! PM me if I can help in any way. I&#039;m also cross-posting this in &#039;Product Requests&#039;

				not an electronic item, but how about a binder or a notebook that has a secret hiding compartment for powders or lsd, maybe even capsules/pills, i know one can just hollow out a book but if someone were to open that book it would be over right then&nbsp;

But LE knows that ALL of the people using SR that are doing things they would be interested in would not buy electronics off of SR that could be so easily used to spy on them. All of the people on SR doing it big have enough money that they wouldnt be interested in discount electronics from an unknown SR vendor especially considering the risks.

My prices are competitive to clearnet prices so it pays to make ones purchases in the currency on hand. That being said I haven&#039;t listed much general consumer electronics. The surveillance/counter surveillance stuff is more popular.
