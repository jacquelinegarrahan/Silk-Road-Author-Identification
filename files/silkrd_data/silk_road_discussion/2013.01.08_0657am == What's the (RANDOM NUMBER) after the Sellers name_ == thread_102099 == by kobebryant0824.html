				It is their rating.<br /><br />John Doe (100) would be a highly rated vendor <br /><br />while JaneDoe(78) Is a vondor that has had several unhappy customers recently. Only 78% of their feedback has been positive<br /><br />The higher the number the better in most cases. I do not like tto use any vendor rated below a 95 personally

				I see, but I notice some vendors don&#039;t have the (100) after their name even when it shows they have 99.9% satisfaction rate with over 300 transaction...what does that mean??

				Amazing.<br /><br />How the fuck did you manage to get on Dark Web with that impressive logic?<br /><br />We do not teach common sense or rounding numbers in here. You should have paid attention in primary school.

				I hope 0824 isnt your last four of your social or the month and year you were born!!! Hope its not anything that can be linked back to you. The name after the vendors name is the rating or score.

People know I&#039;m good, I&#039;d rather have a 92 and not have been ripped off by some cunt than a 97 and done out of my money. Depends how much a vendor is willing to take a hit to maintain their number. I don&#039;t take shit from anyone, others do.

				Wouldn&#039;t you be better off by looking at vendors reputation on sites like this rather then an misconceived number?<br />&nbsp;I would feel more comfortable buying from a vendor with 1000&#039;s transactions than someone with 10&#039;s.
