				The GQ article mentioned that DPR&#039;s English matches the American dialect.&nbsp; Of course this doesn&#039;t mean much because there are Americans all over the globe.<br /><br />I kinda agree with other people, we can be curious but some questions are better off unanswered.

				It was started in the USA. The CIA started it. Remember how they flooded the US with south-american coke to fund black ops, and get youth off LSD in the late 60s ? A few years ago, they needed to get people to stop getting their drugs from the streets, most of which were now originating from and funding countries and organizations belonging to the &quot;axis of evil&quot;, hence they created Silkroad. They gave everything to a random anon from 4chan and, as usual with most CIA operation, they fucked up and everything slipped out of their hands. They destroyed every document about it but, eventually, the one forgotten memo will turn up in a FOIA request.<br /><br />But you&#039;ll have heard it here first.
