				I&#039;m a damn good buyer, and it would be nice for vendors to be able to have more confidence in choosing me as a buyer- reduced requirements for FE, better prices on products, etc.<br /><br />Overall I think it could bring more confidence and health to the SR marketplace.<br /><br /><br />Discuss.<br />

				Please don&#039;t forget vendors get scammed too. All we see are statistics when you place your order. Buyers know they can hold our feedback hostage and they do. I&#039;ve been scammed for money and product by buyers with good stats. It goes both ways.

				Yes, It should be like vendors have a rating percentage, so should buyers, I know you can glean this info from there stats, but there should be a league&nbsp; table for the most spent and least refund rate. <br /><br />I imagine&nbsp; this has been proposed before, though what purpose it would serve is a moot point.

				I support this as well.<br />With buyer&#039;s feedback vendors would know with whom they are making a transaction and could treat customers in the way they deserve. It should be good that if a buyer is trustworthy, respectful etc. this would benefit him/her by better prices and better service; moreover it will highly serve to vendors to shield themselves against unpolite and imbeciles and most of all by scammers.<br /><br />We as buyers can see who the vendors is so it would be perfectly reasonable to have vendors being able to see who the buyer is. If vendors would be able to discern the possible scammers they would not have to be on the safe side all the time and so they could &quot;open up&quot;&nbsp; themselves a little more. As it is now the only way for a vendor to really be sure it is to have an already established clientele with whom to work with and go in stealth (as many do, btw).

				How about a feedback page for vendors similar to ebay? Not only do you see the feedback, but there is also a chart showing how many pos/neg in 6 months and break it down to the 4 basics. Quality, Shipping, Stealth, and communication. I know many buyers break it down in the feedback just out of respect for other potential buyers.<br /><br />You all get what I&#039;m saying?

They then change that to a 100% refund immediately after learning that you are anal about your stats, while calling you a scammer the whole time. <br />&quot;You can just reorder when you get your refund dude but something tells me you do not want to mess up your stats.<br />SO, since I am getting tired of trying to prove to you I am nothing but a good, honest vendor I am refunding ALL of your money back.&quot;<br /><br />Someone this fos and manipulative deserves access to no one&#039;s ratings.<br /><br />

				What you&#039;ve got to realize is that each order you place might not be sent as your new to the vendor they tool hits of no arrivals so they take it out on you the newbie it does work both ways though but more so for the buyers their always taking hits after hit which really does need looking into as a vendor named c63amg fucked me over 2wice in 1 month saying they sent the shit after I FE and on all 4 occasions nothing arrived who took the full force of that me I lost around $750 to c63amg my personal experiences with them was just fucked up so I&#039;ll never deal with them again oh by the way when I delt with them scammers c63amg my stats was perfect 0%&nbsp; on everything and I&#039;d spent around $8000 in 4 months and they still fucked me over so it&#039;s down to the vendors honesty at the end of the day showing stats don&#039;t mean shit it&#039;s just a ploy to make you feel better when you FE anyway good discussion m8 to the OP cheers oh and remember steer clear of c63amg their what&#039;s called selective scammers ok peace out cheers.

				A buyer rating system would be abused by vendors to extort good ratings for themselves. Buyers on average place fewer orders than vendors receive, so a single bad review for a buyer can kill their stats more than a single bad review for a vendor, so the pressure from extortion threats would be higher for buyers. eBay had a buyer rating system years ago and abandoned it for that reason.<br /><br />Overall you would see the quality and informativeness of vendor ratings go down.<br />
