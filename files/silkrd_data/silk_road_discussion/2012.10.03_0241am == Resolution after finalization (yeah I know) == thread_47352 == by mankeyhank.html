				I placed a decent sized order a while back with a vendor who it turns out has had some difficulty from his suppliers; the result for me was that I waited for the package to arrive until I was only a few days away from AFing, which obviously is not something I want. I saw him post a message on his vendor page which led me to believe that it should have at least shipped from his end by that time, and decided to finalize and leave good feedback rather than going to resolution in the hopes that I would receive it. In retrospect this was obviously not the wisest choice. I still have not received my order and it seems possible that finalizing it may have removed me from the order list before my order was fulfilled. This vendor has also said that he doesn&#039;t respond to &quot;where&#039;s my order&quot; type messages. What should I do? I understand the finalize button is final, but is there any way I can bring this issue up to the vendor or SR support in order to get my money&#039;s worth without messing up my stats for the future?

				1) Message the vendor and say &quot;wheres my order&quot;. It sounds like it has been long enough for you to deserve an answer to that question.<br /><br />2) Try and work with the vendor to reach a resolution that will allow you to still leave a 5/5<br /><br />3)If not, change your feedback to 1/5 and explain why in your feedback. You can always go change it again anytime.<br /><br />4)You can contact SR, but they cant do anything other then close his account if he is scamming everyone.<br /><br />Once you finalize. Your BTC is gone. Even SR admins can not get it back for you. So hope for some product.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />

I had a vendor state that shipping could take up to 30 days I asked for more time at 15 and it got added to the total got package as the vendor is a reputable one, abit of worry but that is the learning curve...&nbsp; I just hope you order shows up and you have picked a solid vendor to purchase from I would pick a title more like &quot;20 days and no order about to change feedback please reply&quot;
