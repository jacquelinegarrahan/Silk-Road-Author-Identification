				&nbsp;;D I love nomad bloodbath. Whatever he&#039;s up to I hope he&#039;s having fun and in a relaxed state of mind.In the day, I like to think he&#039;s taking it easy on a beach somewhere. Soaking in the tropical sun. Filling in that awful uneven farmers tan.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; Drinking his favorite beverage with no bottom. :) Being served to him by beautiful &quot;and very friendly&quot; women of all types. Feeling that warm sea breeze flow around his wispy haired, oddly shaped head. And through his ears and long flowing, more salt than pepper uneven beard. Causing a slight unusual high pitched sound when he turns his head to the left. And his beard hits people in the face behind him.&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />His nights are probably filled with wild drug induced sexual marathons with the experienced and not so experienced. Puttin down all around.&nbsp; ;D<br />I imagine not every night would be drug induced but hey, why not right?&nbsp; :) Remember to drink plenty of water and take vitamins. All kidding and jokes aside, I think you are great nomad.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I look forward to your return but take all the time you need. I hope you come back soon. Take care my friend.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I dont know much about Nomad because I honestly dont have any dealings with him but he said somethings about a trusted member of this forum that I know are not true and because of that until I speak to Nomad and get a better understanding of why he said something like this I dont really mind his absence. Like I said I dont have a problem with him but I do have a problem with a trusted, honest members integrity being called into question, especially when I know the accusations made were completely false.<br /><br />I definitely hope he is safe and healthy but until I know why he said those things I dont mind him being gone.<br /><br />*Sorry about not going in2 what was said but I just dont feel its appropriate for me to repeat it<br /><br />***Nomad recently shed light on the instance that I posted about and now that I have a better understanding of why he said what he did I feel much better about Nomad. I am glad for his return and wish all of our mods only the best.

				OK, now for the where, why I have been.<br />I have been at home for the last 8+ days with my computer turned off.<br />This eased my daily pain a bit, not much because I purposely went cold turkey on drug use to cleanse out my toxins. Sorry this was unannounced but very much needed.<br />I spent about 6+ days in bed sweating and sleeping out the toxins through withdrawals.<br />Only leaving for 5-10 minutes at a time to use bathroom or grab anything i could eat. I would then return asap to me bed. I lost about 15 pounds so I guess this is a &quot;?healthy?&quot; way to lose weight? :P<br />I need to detox myself because I had basically a tolerance to most drugs on the SR menu and that is a huge problem.<br /><br />Some of you may have heard that I developed a Dissociative Tolerance...I have no idea how to fix this tolerance. Dissociatives no longer work with me, at least for now. I need to do some deep Dissociative Tolerance research. I had almost 4 grams of Ketamine....no khole achieved...same with MXE. :(<br /><br />So this was the initial reason I decided to detox, but then I thought about the dosage levels I was taking on other drugs I enjoy and realized it was off the charts as well. This was my thinking process and i turned the computer off and took care of myself. Sorry if this inconvenienced anyone, i know it has a few(you know who you are and I you).&nbsp; My health IRL is more valuable to me than the inconvenienced few, sad but true. I plan making right to these few, when I get the chance, most likely next week. <br /><br />In the future vendors and sending me samples to validate legitimacy, has been changed to you offer me samples and I offer you a list of trust worthy senior members to test...I think this is a much better idea than me bearing the sole source for the legitimacy of a vendor or his sample sent to me. Though this has not caused my situation it is very stressful when a scammer sends me a sample and then rips off everyone after I vouched for their product. It not fair to me or to the community.<br /><br />Anyway I turned Tor on last night and ventured into the Silc Channel and noticed quite a few new chat members and many friends. So though I still get fevers sometimes I&#039;ll try to wade through the forums as much as possible. Maybe not as much as before but just because i&#039;m not logged in doesnt mean i don&#039;t see what&#039;s going on around here.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually looking for a few moderators to help, if you think you are mod material contact me via PM on the SRM: http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1499<br /><br /><br /><br />Questions are welcomed in this thread, plx do not fill my PM box.<br /><br />What drama comes next?<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				I&#039;m always glad to see you around here, nomad, but I understand *exactly* what you are talking about...I&#039;ve got many years in this circus, and SR provides avenues I&#039;m not used to having open to me, and I&#039;ve done some harsh kicking myself, and worse, had to jack up my methadone intake, which is, well...u know...we have to take care of ourselves, and keep some sort of priority on what&#039;s important.&nbsp; Anyway, take care of yourself.
