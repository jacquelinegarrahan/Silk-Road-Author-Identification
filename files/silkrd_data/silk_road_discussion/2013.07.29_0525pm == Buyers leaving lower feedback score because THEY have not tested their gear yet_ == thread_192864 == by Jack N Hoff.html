				This sounds absolutely ridiculous to me.&nbsp; Should a customer leave a vendor a lower feedback score because the customer is waiting to test the product? ???<br /><br />In my mind they should wait until they test it before they leave feedback or leave a 5/5 when they receive the best possible service and very fast shipping and update it after they test it.<br /><br />I recently had a customer do this and it&#039;s really putting me off the idea of ever dealing with this customer again.<br /><br />Why would you rate a vendor&#039;s feedback score lower because YOU have not tested the product yet?&nbsp; What does that have to do with MY score? :o<br /><br />Thoughts and opinions?

				It&#039;s not proper protocol and not what the feedback rating is meant for. <br /><br />Think of it as a teaching moment. Most buyers don&#039;t know that they can finalize without leaving feedback. <br /><br />Step 1: Click finalize.<br />Step 2: when rating page comes up, do nothing. Close tab or close browser. <br /><br />Next time orders tab is clicked, the option to leave feedback will be found there.

				I agree, as a buyer I always leave a 5/5 and a &#039;not tested&#039; message in feedback.<br /><br />You can update feedback by going to &#039;account&#039; and then &#039;feedback&#039;.<br /><br />A lot of people never bother to update.

				It&#039;s stupid to say the least.&nbsp; You can always edit feedback later if it turns out your vendor has sent you dog shit instead of what you ordered.

				Total bullshit Jack. Wow.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had something similar happen before on my domestic accounts, but with orders for $1000+ dollars... that&#039;s just fucking ridiculous. Yikes.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind messaging me customers SR UN so I can avoid them with them inevitably come to me after you ditch them, that&#039;d be great.<br /><br /><br /><br />One more thought: You don&#039;t think this has anything to do with the slop ass message you received the other day, do you? <br /><br />Second thought after reading the actual 4/5 feedback: Shoulda cut him that 20 dollars off Jacky. Jesus christ, the sense of entitlement of some people blows my mind. I guess it shouldn&#039;t be surprising. I&#039;m sure the trust fund fuckers flock to SR something fierce.

				The quality has been tested and the feedback has been updated. :D<br /><br /><br />I still do not approve of lowering the feedback score because you have not tested the product yet...

				As someone who made a first purchase last week, I&#039;d like to echo Pharmington Rex&#039;s comment about most buyers not knowing that they can finalize without leaving feedback. It might seem common sense, BruceCampbell, but even old codgers like me pee themselves like star-struck little girls the first few times they actually see drugs hand-delivered by the mailman. They ain&#039;t waiting around to figure out the vagaries of the SL feedback system.

				I always finalize as soon as I receive the gear, then navigate away from the page and go back and leave the review after I&#039;ve tested it (sometimes a week later, but that makes no difference as the BTC has already been released)<br /><br />That being said, the way it is set up COULD be a little less confusing, to the newbie it appears you must leave the feedback at the time you finalize.....<br />

It may be annoying to see that when trying to read a vendors feedback but it makes it a lot easier to spot a scam while it is happening.<br /><br />As for the OP, i think leaving a lower score until testing the product is a terrible practice. I have also seen buyers leaving a 3/5 when FE&#039;ing. I think this is also terrible. If a vendor requires you to fe you should either accept it and leave a 5/5 then adjust accordingly after you receive your product or go to a different vendor. You shouldn&#039;t leave a negative feedback because you dislike a policy that you agreed to.

				Someone I introduced to SR bought a 10 pack of LSD from a well known vendor with 100 feedback and left 1/5 for the FE. It was his first SR transaction with no buyer history and he used a brand new account. Showed up as an RC that tested correctly with Erylch&#039;s but was clearly not LSD (achieved with a simple but not widely known trick, only seen it IRL one other time). I honestly did not have much sympathy for him.

				To be honest I&#039;ve given way too much bogus feedback....in a positive way.&nbsp; When your a noob, and in awe of how hero vendor types can complete over 300 transactions with nothing but 5/5 you feel obligated to give the 5.&nbsp; &nbsp;More than half my 10 or so orders deserved less....but who wants to be that noob? Most orders deserve 4/5...which should be considered a good rating....not bad.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now maybe if the product got me laid....then 5/5.

				Are they crazy? It is an insane to leave 1/5 feedback, because the product isn&#039;t tested yet.<br /><br />Personally, I admire and respect the work the sellers do, of course, I mean the top sellers.<br /><br />In SR, most of sellers are trusted sellers, and sell quality products, at least in my buyer experience.<br /><br />Love and peace to all.

Buyers should leave a score on comms, delivery time and stealth and then once tried the product they should update it, whether it be good or bad. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t deal with the customer again if I was you, they are willing to damage your business because of something entirely out of your control. It&#039;s not like you can go to their home and force feed them the product, so you shouldn&#039;t have to suffer!
