				I just lost 50&nbsp; dollars due to what I perceive as a glitch in the Mt Gox system.&nbsp; Created a new account transferred the money from dwolla only to be locked out when I tried to log in again and got a Invalid username/password.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m 99% sure I used the right pw/username combo.&nbsp; I then attempt to recover my password through my email and the link takes me to a blank error page on their site.&nbsp; <br /><br />So fuck mt gox im done with that piece of shit site and their lax security measures.&nbsp; Where is everyone buying their bitcoins from recently?

				Yup: dwolla + tradehill seems to work good.&nbsp; I was wondering tho, if y&#039;all put yer&nbsp; tradehill referral #s .... seems too good a link if LE ever got interested...I took it down...always a crap shoot, what to be careful about, and what isn&#039;t important...&nbsp; but back to topic: TH is good, and also, seems it&#039;s stabilizing around 15 btc a $, which is good...for many of us, we aren&#039;t in it to speculate, just to get coin, and the less it bounces, the better off we be... :)

				I&#039;ve been able to use mtgox since the breach / relaunch, but i use bitcoin7.com as a backup. however they have really shitty support. they do have a good trading api, but nowhere near mtgox&#039;s. i&#039;ve utilized dwolla + bitcoin7 without issues. however bitcoin7.com is in bulgaria or something...guard up&nbsp; 8)

				I just bought bitcoins off of Silk Road.&nbsp; I sent the money in the mail and the seller transferred the coins to my account.<br /><br />When I want to cashout I&#039;ll probably just offer to sell bitcoins for cash.&nbsp; Or......druuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugs...

				Tradehill has really great support and pretty fast dwolla transfers. Overall, the site is very nice. I&#039;m going to start using cavirtex, in Canada, now that it&#039;s live, because you can use a cash deposit.
