				first, i know i&#039;ve read this before, but i&#039;ve never seen a thread dedicated to it.&nbsp; so, sorry if this is &quot;beating a dead horse&quot; for some people.<br /><br /><br />in review threads and a even elsewhere lately, a very large number of people have been posting things like &quot;just received X specific package in Y specific region, it took exactly Z amount of time&quot;&nbsp; or even worse, &quot;my order for X was marked in transit today.&nbsp; it&#039;s being shipped to Y, when do you think it will be here?&quot;<br /><br />when you post things like this, especially the second example, it helps LEO, postal inspectors, customs, whatever.&nbsp; they already know the country of origin usually, and now you have provided them with a relatively small time frame and area of delivery to look for.&nbsp; this severely degrades one of the things that keep our packages most safe:&nbsp; the ability to blend in.&nbsp; <br /><br />my main concern (since i don&#039;t really care if morons like this received their package or not) is that if you cause a vendor&#039;s package to get intecepted, anyone else who orders between that time until the vendor changes shipping/packaging methods is likely to not receive either.<br /><br />so please please please be a little less vague, ESPECIALLY about orders you have recently made, or that have recently been sent.&nbsp; it&#039;s not a secret that LE wants to hurt SR any way they can, so let&#039;s not give them what they&#039;re looking for!&nbsp;

Great post!! i would like to see SR last longer than the other sites i use to deal with. But no site touches the Road b/c we are all out to help one another &quot;well most of us are&quot;. Lets keep this thing as quiet as possible, b/c i think it&#039;s more than enough established already. i see noobs ever other time i log onto SR and i don&#039;t wanna get pinched by no dweeb

May I ask how YOU found out about Silk Road? Hypothetically speaking, if it were possible, would it be just to wipe every trace of Silk Road from clearweb tweets and news reports?! I myself found out about SR after the very first Gawker article and have since spent many thousands of US $ here. The publicity that surrounds us is the best possible thing for ALL of us. Just because YOU now know about Silk Road, does that mean your peers shouldn&#039;t be afforded the same opportunities as you?<br /><br />Everybody was a &#039;noob&#039; once. Given your viewpoint I would hazard a guess that you remain a &#039;noob.&#039;<br />We don&#039;t need to keep SR quiet, we need to shout it from the rooftops. We need to convince others to start using it to purchase their product of choice. We need to allow the masses to enlighten themselves through the purchase of personally enlightening subtstances. We need to allow those of us who are addicted to substances to purchase peer reviewed products without risking being robbed or being supplied with bunk / dangerous product. We need to allow our experimenting teens purchase products which are vouched for, tested, and for which they have some degree of recourse rather than sending them out onto the street looking to score who knows what from their neighbourhood dealer, with the risks inherent therein.<br /><br />Ladies and gents, if you cannot see the value of Silk Road beyond the fact that it caters very well to your choice of substances, you&#039;re missing the entire point of what Silk Road / Dread Pirate Roberts envisioned. Sure, Silk Road is a money-making entity, but it HAS to be in order to finance it&#039;s security. I don&#039;t think anybody would begrudge DPR his/her/their rightful cut of the earnings either.<br /><br />Silk Road is revolutionary in the extreme, but not just for personal choice. Every product we purchase stands for something. Every Dollar/Euro/Pound/Rand/Franc we spend here makes a statement. A statement that we support freeing our brethren from the shackles of their forced criminality. A statement that we need to breathe life into those who are being destroyed by &#039;the system.&#039; A statement that we need&nbsp; to and WILL offer a lifeline to those who are forced into local &#039;criminality&#039;. We need to support those who CHOOSE to enlighten their communities and customers by supplying the BEST product in their locality. We need to move away from punishing personal choice. We need to move away from government thinking they &#039;know what&#039;s best.&quot; WE ARE ALL BORN FREE. WE ALL DIE FREE. It is the constraints of bondage of GOVERNMENT that take away our free will during the course of our lives. EVERY SINGLE HUMAN IS BORN FREE.<br /><br />Though I am atheist, to those of you who are of a religious persuasion, and your governments who blindly follow the the same ideals: did God not grant every individual free will?! Did He/She/It not afford you the opportunity to make your own choices in life?! Who is your government to take away your NATURAL, FREE rights?! Who is your government to say that you cannot partake in something simply because they consider it to be &#039;bad&#039;?! WHO IS ONE MAN, OR ONE WOMAN, TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT DO SOMETHING WITH *YOUR* BODY?! Rise up. Fight the tyranny inherent in the system you&#039;ve come to rely on. Never allow yourself to be instructed by another entity, especially an entity with self-preservation on it&#039;s mind.<br /><br />The system isn&#039;t going to change because of our small actions. We need to TAKE CONTROL of the system in order to change it. We have the ways and means to do this through mass revolt. Unfortunately a HUGE number of us couldn&#039;t be bothered. As much of a hypocrite as it may make me, I must include myself there. I have no shame in admitting that, because it is the truth. We must force out the lies, both from ourselves and from our governments. We must eliminate governmental self-preservation, and we must eliminate personal ideals of self-preservation. We must - together and in complete agreement - fight for the right of the individual to govern him/herself.<br /><br />HeadDoc, tell your friends about Silk Road. Foster their potential anti-government sentiment. Encourage them to fight for what is naturally RIGHT. Never let anyone tell you that you are doing wrong by fostering the spirit of rebellion. Without rebellion, our people as a whole would have been crushed under some flag or another centuries ago.<br /><br />Keep up the good fight. Never give in. Never give up. Never capitulate to those whose sole purpose is to take away your freedom.<br />To quote someone FAR wiser than I: be the change you wish to see in the world.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				hey GG, I rather people tell their FRIENDS and increase membership that way, then a journalist write an article about it and everyone and their dog knows about it. Which makes politicians and more LEO&#039;s know about it and actually want to try to do something about it.

				graham, while i appreciate your oh-so-eloquent diatribe against oppresive governments, and completely agree, i think the logic most likely to be listened to by someone like HeadDoc is:<br /><br />as buyers, we NEED &quot;noob&quot; vendors to find this place.&nbsp; if every time a vendor left, he was never replaced, silk road would become bad very fast.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />i do agree with opi, that media can definitely put pressure on law enforcement to do something, even if that something is just intercepting more packages. (still not good)<br /><br />but depending on the media outlet, i do believe that some might do more good than harm.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				In reply to the OP--I agree.&nbsp; I limit my feedbacks to &quot;continent of origin to continent of receipt&quot; if its even relevent, and don&#039;t get specific as to where in the continent the package was shipped to.&nbsp; I also (***unlike so many other***), use the edit feedback feature of this site, and typically don&#039;t post that kind of information until a week or two after I&#039;ve received, tested, and enjoyed the product.&nbsp; I think that information, and the timeframe of posting it, not only gives LE very little to work with, but is also somewhat valuable to the other members on this site.<br /><br />If I&#039;m out of line, feel free to call me on it.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to know what others think.<br /><br />As for GG&#039;s reply--<br /><br />Spreading the word is a great idea in principle.&nbsp; The only thing I don&#039;t like about the media publicity is it&#039;s blatant bias and disregard for truthful reporting.&nbsp; A few threads down, there is a thread about ASSHOLE reporters writing about Silk Road, and one of them said in the intro sentence that you can get drugs, weapons, and child porn on Silk Road.&nbsp; That is wrong and sends the entirely wrong message to government officials, who, let&#039;s be honest, will take that report on it&#039;s word and will proceed under the assumption that SR does indeed make CP accessible to all<br /><br />Word of mouth seems to be good enough for me to allow this community to grow.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here for over a year, and I used to &quot;keep real quiet&quot; about this site, until the original Gawker article was released.&nbsp; After seeing the feedback from community members, I realized that it&#039;s &quot;safe&quot; to keep SR a secret, yes, but in order for SR to grow and become THE go-to marketplace for our favorite substances, the word needs to be spread.&nbsp; Since that article was released, I&#039;ve referred probably 10 new users to this site.<br /><br />But don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t just go around preaching about this place to everyone I think might be interested.&nbsp; I only tell people who I know are trustworthy, resourceful, and have a good enough head on their shoulders to be upstanding members of this community.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to get tons of newbs on this site who have no idea what its all about.&nbsp; Everyone I&#039;ve &quot;brought in to the loop&quot; already knew about PGP, security, anonymity, and most of all, respect and patience.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure who they&#039;ve gone and told after that--but we discussed it and I trust them enough to make good decisions if they are actually inclined to share this site with others.<br /><br />Above all, members need to be RESPECTFUL to every other member, period.&nbsp; I find that there are many users who take this place for granted, and have the idea in their head that since they got here, they have a right to act like they own it.&nbsp; I hate that attitude.&nbsp; So unrestricted growth, in my opinion, is a slippery slope for tihs site to go on

When LE decides to crack down, there are far easier ways to do what you&#039;re suggesting than deciphering ambiguous seller feedback and try to time interception of packages to a particular region. To pinpoint a vendor, they need only open an account and start buying from that vendor. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ve got a map somewhere where they&#039;ve narrowed each major vendor down to postal code &amp; area they ship from both domestic and international. To find out buyer info they can either flip a current vendor they bust or get someone they&#039;ve already busted to play narc to just setup shop with a vending account and just start collecting names and addresses in the process of making sales. They could just start monitoring these addresses for incoming shipments.

For example if a new prodcut is released, and 10 people say theyre expecting something that would be in a specific size parcel or envelope from indonesia, the amount of items arriving from indonesia through customs each day is probably small enough that 20 or 30 or more matching parcels would be much more easily found and suspected if a heads up was provided, even if the packaging, return address, etc were all new.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;m sure there is someone (or multiple) like a DEA agent whose&nbsp; job is to advise customs on current red flags and specific areas to watch for SR packages. there is no reason to give them any extra for the list.<br /><br />again, thank you jpinkman for pointing out what was rational and what was not.&nbsp; i&#039;m a bit embarassed that i let my drug induced state make my tinfoil thick enough to overtake logic. but your name is hilariously appropriate for the drug that caused the issues. :D

				At most one could say, &quot;took x days to arrive to East Coast.&quot; That&#039;s the absolute max that could be said. After all, east coast is comprised of 13+ states (depending on whether you count states that don&#039;t exactly border the &quot;coast&quot;). Massive geological area that wouldn&#039;t tip LEO off to anything specific. Just never mention state or county. And never mention the Seller&#039;s state. <br /><br />Pretty much first class mail or Priority mail only takes 1-4 days to anywhere in the US. It may seem longer because some sellers mark &quot;in transit&quot; when in fact it&#039;s not actually in transit on the day they marked it as such. <br /><br />So in the end, no one really needs to leave feedback about how many days in transit the package was. If anything that would be helpful, say, &quot;took seller x days to ship after order.&quot; (Just compare your postmark with the day they marked in transit). This way your fellow buyers can see if there&#039;s a pattern to the seller&#039;s shipping time and can decide if it&#039;s worth the wait or the probability that the package will make it by the weekend. ;)

				time in transit does vary significantly with international orders.&nbsp; it is good to have an idea of recent shipping times, especially so you know if you should be worried it&#039;s late.&nbsp; like i said above, it may not be much risk at all after the fact, but just wait a random period of time before leaving the feedback (still finalize of course) and if it&#039;s something you receive regularly, don&#039;t post the same thing verbatim every time.&nbsp; maybe it will never be used against you, but why knowingly leave any pattern to follow?
