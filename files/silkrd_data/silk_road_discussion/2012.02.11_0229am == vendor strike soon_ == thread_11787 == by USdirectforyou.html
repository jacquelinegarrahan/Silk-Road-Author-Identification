				If this problem with all the missing coins doesn&#039;t get resolved; should we strike and put our accounts on vacation? or&nbsp; should we just disable our auto withdrawal until this gets fixed? This is taking way longer than it should. I have 101 coins still not transfered and $460 I cant access in another account. Smells like something fishy is up.... I hope not

				Vendor strike soon? More like vendor strike happening right now. Some of the vendors, such as Christy Nugs, are forced to go into vacation mode as they wait for their bitcoins to show up in their wallets.

				sorry if this is a stupid question but what if vendors would be willing to accept other forms of payment like moneypak, paypal...etc and until its settled we can ignore this bitcoin problem.....i know a lot of venders are losing money and customers are getting more and more weary

				I agree. Maybe Western Union anonymous test question option? Just go to a WU that will have no cameras to ID you or a shitty one like a grocery store, rather than a check cashing? Use a fake name. We should let the admin know we will do this if not fixed soon. This will be all at risk of the buyer though.

				Using payment method other than BTC is a security risk. This site was built for use with bitcoin, not those other methods. It is not worth any amount of money in my eyes. All WU have cameras, Even if its just a web cam pointing at you. I&#039;m pretty sure its a requirement. Also, you can&#039;t use a fake name, you need to show ID
