				I&#039;m high as fuck but it&#039;s a thought that keeps bothering me for few months now.<br />We are one of the most amazing communities this planet ever witnessed. We are writing history whether we like it or not.<br />I think it&#039;s time for us to evolve, I&#039;m a huge fan of Charles Darwin and if he would have been part of this community he would have agreed with what I&#039;m about to say.<br /><br />I am sure that on this forum are employed people like me that have a stable income and are willing to pay for a lawyer. <br /><br />I&#039;m aware of the fact that there are users that already have a lawyer but on the other hand there are users like me, that never got a fine in their entire life. So there was no need what so ever for a lawyer so far. I have been a drug user and a &quot;part-time dealer&quot; for years now. However due to the fact that I carefully plan every step I make, I managed to stay safe so far.<br />My logic on the other hand is aware of the fact that there are things in life which I can&#039;t control.<br /><br />What is the point of this topic?<br /><br />Silk road getting formal lawyers that could answer our questions and guide us through our journey on the road.<br /><br />How?<br />50 users * 1 BTC = 50 BTC that is £365. A decent lawyer charges £100-£200 per hour. The lawyer would definitely be happy considering that he would do it through TOR in front of his computer wanking or getting a blowjob from his girlfriend. I believe everyone is aware of The Attorney-Client Privilege.<br /><br />To try things out, USA and UK could go for it and kind of &quot;test it&quot;, see how it goes. There is no contract what so ever, so we could stop collaborating at any time given.<br /><br />If there is a positive response to my thought we could start elaborating on the subject. I will never ask for your money and I am not going to start looking for lawyers as I might know nothing about this project even tho I&#039;m starting it.<br /><br />There are few things that I would like to mention:<br />1) Only users paying would benefit from services.<br />2) Communication would be possible only through tormail.<br />3) This would not be your lawyer if you go to court. You need a back up plan.<br />4) The point of this project is to stay safe while you travel down the road.<br />5) Fuck mtlJohn.<br /><br />On a second thought if you consider that my project is bad or it&#039;s not worth the effort you could ask your law students friends to join the forum.<br /><br />You have to be a ignorant, cocky and a bit stupid individual to believe that you know more about law than a student or a lawyer. Of course excluding people that studied law.<br /><br />LONG LIVE SR!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				What legal questions do you have in mind?<br /><br />I might save you some money... <br />Selling drugs? That&#039;s a crime.<br />Possessing drugs? Crime.<br />Sending drugs through the mail? Tax evasion? Money laundering? Crime, crime and crime.<br /><br />I&#039;ll only charge you 100 USD for that advice and you just saved yourself a fair bit of cash.

People get off of charges all the time with help from a lawyer. Better if its one of us. If the glove don&#039;t fit, am I right?

				I hate to say this because I like your enthusiasm, tch, and I think your heart is in the right place, but I don&#039;t think this is a good idea.<br /><br />I noticed an &quot;ask a lawyer (USA)&quot; thread the other day on the forums and thought that was pretty cool, and it would be a good thing if lawyers from other countries follow suit. What you&#039;re talking about, of course, is private communication with sol/cli privilege a factor. Problems that come to mind:<br /><br />i) I would bet money that most cops could do a decent enough job of impersonating a crim lawyer to fool most non-lawyers<br />ii) if you actually managed to get a lawyer, there&#039;s no guarantee you&#039;d have found a GOOD lawyer, and having a bad lawyer can be worse than having no lawyer<br />iii) with communications being private, no one gets a chance to call the cop/bad lawyer out on their shit<br /><br />One of the first SR forum threads I read included a statement of fact about criminal laws in my country that was simply WRONG. Very, very wrong. I was all set to post a correction with links to the relevant laws online when I noticed that the thing was months old so I didn&#039;t bother. You get information like that in a private message, there&#039;s no one to set either of you straight.<br /><br />Add to this that it&#039;s just not so hard to get a lawyer (of random quality). I&#039;d rather trust a lawyer in the flesh who is legally bound to see to my best interests (with a few restrictions) than a completely anonymous stranger with no tie to me but a love of bitcoins. Just my $.02. Don&#039;t mean to rain on your parade. I also think this is a pretty awesome community.
