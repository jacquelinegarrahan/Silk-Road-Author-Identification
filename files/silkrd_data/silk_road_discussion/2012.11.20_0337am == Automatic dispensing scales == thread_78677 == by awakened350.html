				Yep I do the same. Tend to aim for 10% extra. It makes weighing easier because if its 1.07g I can just say close enough and it keeps customers happy and never a problem with it coming up light. If I got this I&#039;d plan to just punch in 1.1g. Main concern is that some powders may be too light and fluffy to work properly.

				The one in the link isn´t precise enough, you would need a precision dispenser like the ones they sell in the pharmacies. I´ll try find a link. <br />

				Plus with a max throw of 300grains you are looking at less then 20gram (19.4gram) max.<br /><br />good for some stuff...simply not enough for others.<br /><br />Cool idea though<br />

But my biggest sellers is 1g of product. It takes the most time to weigh out too.&nbsp; .05ish accuracy would be close enough to come in around 1.0-1.15g
