				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Thanks for all the advice regarding my last post. You guys were awesome and supportive, and luckily I was able to sort it out. So thanks so much. <br /><br />Now I am a little concerned, I got some packages I know were confirmed and I sent them out...about $5000 worth...<br />There are also some packages which I attempted to confirm but got the error page and have not been able to check if these were confirmed or not.<br /><br />Now here is my concern.<br /><br />1. If unfortunately SR goes down what happens to my money is escrow? I know my wallet money goes to my back up address but what about my escrow money for products I sent out?<br />2. Should I send out the packages which I am unsure if they have been confirmed or not?<br /><br /><br />Regarding number 2, for example, let us say they receive the package. SR goes back up, they have the option to cancel the order (since my confirm did not go through), and BAM I just sent out $3000 in orders for free. <br /><br />What do you guys think I should do? I am not a wealthy person, not am I a top money making vendor. I sell a couple oz or so a week to help pay the bills and feed the kids. While this is not a big operation and I do not have 100 000 sales a day like a lot of vendors, the money that this makes for me is essential in allowing me to pay the bills. <br /><br />This is not a scam attempt, this is not a donation plea, merely just looking for advice. <br />And obviously I am not so broke that I want to go and become a prostitute, that is not the lifestyle for me at this time. SR allowed me the most anonymous means to make money and I love it. I do have a job, it just isn&#039;t a very high paying one. I really hope SR gets back up soon. Thanks for the advice, and most of all, thanks for listening. <br /><br /><br />White Shark &lt;3 <br /><br />=)
