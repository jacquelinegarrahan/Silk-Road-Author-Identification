				Got a call from 2 friends telling me they received &quot;cards in the mail&quot; purporting to be from vendors with hushmail addresses to contact them. No vendor is going to send you a card but the DEA might: http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4483.html

				Bullshit.<br />I was thinking of mailing my top customers some coupons and other stuff. The only problem is it would cost a FORTUNE to do so as the shippers have my customers addresses, I have some of their tracking numbers.&nbsp; That amounts to about $50 a card/coupon to ship to EACH customer.<br /><br />By the location they are shipped from, and the stealth used before customers WILL INDEED recognize if this is real or not.<br />

				Im not saying this couldnt happen but I am a vendor and im sitting on tons of H that I dont know anyone in real life that would buy it. I was thinking about reaching out 2 some of my customers as well. And I hate people that spread rumors and gossip about the police, police tactics, or whos a rat. When you do this your fucking shit up.

Why do you people assume the world evolves around the USA?? Only 30% of SR&#039;s customers are in the USA, assume the number of USA Vendors are also around 30%.<br /><br />I am not an American, those of us who are not Americans do not fear of the &quot;LE Boogieman&quot; watching through our windows. <br /><br />Yes there are some countries that cooperate with US Law enforcement but I assure you of one thing...If the story ever broke that USA law enforcement sent agents to countries such as ours to flush out some pill customers in the USA, they would have a front page international incident that would get more attentions than all illegal marketplaces being raided and closed simultaneously.<br />
