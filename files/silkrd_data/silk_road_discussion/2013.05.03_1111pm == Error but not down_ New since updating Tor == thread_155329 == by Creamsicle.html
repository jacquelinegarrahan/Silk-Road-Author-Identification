				I decided to update the Tor browser bundle to see if that would increase my chances of possibly being able to get in. Since I have updated I have been getting a page that loads with the Silk Road logo at the top that reads:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sorry, an error was encountered.<br /><br />We could not process your request.

Before I updated a couple hours ago I would just get a regular timeout error but no page was loading. <br /><br />Anyone else notice this?

There is no update for that browser. It&#039;s (from what I have read) a virus. Good luck.

				Maybe he was using an old version of Tor and never upgraded to current? Yeah though unless the homepage of Tor isn&#039;t prompting you to update a new version hasn&#039;t been released.<br /><br />Oh I just went on the site, I think a new version was released. I usually get asked to upgrade when there&#039;s a new one on the tor check page. :-\

How long have you been using it, have you updated it? I know when I first joined the road I used the torbrowser, yet after reading forums for nearly 24 hours straight the first night of being on the road. I quickly stopped. It&#039;s better to be safe than sorry in this instance. That&#039;s for damn sure<br /><br />Think of the browser as a convenient store, where everything is more expensive. It&#039;s convenient at a cost. That&#039;s all I am saying. I just downloaded the browser yesterday so that I could not have to be off my windows while reading the forums. I have not seen the browser in 2 months. And one thing I did not do was go look for an update that was not put there by the tor homepage.

				I first downloaded tor a while ago and I&#039;ve only upgraded to the ones that the check page prompted me to upgrade. If there has been one that was released yesterday or any time within the past few days I&#039;m not using that one.

				I was a bit concerned too. saw the browser bundle update and did it (I actually did the wrong one, I did for 64 but mac)<br /><br />then I started reading. The update came out April 5th or so...and since I had the version that was out when I joined in October, I updated it<br /><br />I started getting those messages too<br /><br />do this<br /><br />If you want to completely remove Tor, and your account has Admin Privileges, then proceed as follows:<br /><br />Open Finder and click on Applications.<br />Drag /Applications/TorBrowser to the Trash.<br />Remove /Library/Torbutton from your system.<br />In your User or home directory, go to Library, remove the Vidalia directory<br /><br /><br />and then get the browser again. A clean install<br /><br />Note* it hasnt helped me get on SR, but I get the time out messages now, not the other one<br /><br />I feel safer that I did this

				Don&#039;t panic as we&#039;ve the latest version of the Tor application &amp; received the same message<br /><br />There&#039;s probably a few static pages that come up during interruptions<br /><br />
