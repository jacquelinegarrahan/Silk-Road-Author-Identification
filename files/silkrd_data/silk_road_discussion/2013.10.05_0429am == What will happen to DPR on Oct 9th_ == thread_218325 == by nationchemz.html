				One of three things will happen to Ross Ulbricht on the 9th of Oct.<br /><br />1. Released on Bail or unsecured bond<br />2. home confinement<br />3. Remanded into custody<br /><br />Federal court is very different than state court and very fair when it comes to bail hearings. The hearing will be open to the public and he is going to need family and close friend support as they will be speaking to per-trial services who works for the judge and advises the judge. Basically whatever pre-trial says goes no matter what the prosecutor says. They can only remand him into custody for two reasons. 1.&nbsp; Danger to the community 2. flight risk. The AUSA has to prove to the judge and per-trial services that he fits into one or both these criteria.. They are going to have a hell of a time proving flight risk, but danger to the community is going to be easier for them with the murder for hire charges. Ulbricht&#039;s record will also come into play, but only if he has a history of violence. It seems that he does not have a record or that would have been leaked by now so I don&#039;t think that will be an issue for him. <br /><br />My honest opinion is that he will receive a 100000-250000 secured bond and be on home confinement with a condition that he can not have a computer or any device connected to the internet.

I think he&#039;ll definitely be remanded. I would agree with you if he weren&#039;t also indicted separately for both hiring someone to commit murder and attempted murder. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re gonna grant him bail, not even with home confinement. I&#039;m sure they also consider him a flight risk.

They kept my friend in custody the entire time fir the reasons you mention. It took like 2 years for him to be sentenced. It&#039;s not that hard to have someone remanded in federal court. THe prosecutors are basically grant every single delay they request. I feel very sorry for DPR, because it&#039;s a long fucking process with the feds.

				I doubt he gets out. I think they would be scared he was a flight risk....1. they dont want a Snowden fiasco 2.&nbsp; They probably think / assume that someone in the community (DeepWeb/Tor/Markets) wouldnt hesitate to get him out of here to protect him, and possibly get SR2.0 up and running....if that happened that would be some HUGE ASS BALLS.<br /><br />IForgotMyFuckingPassword - If for some reason he waived his right to jury trial and plead guilty it would go A LOT faster, but since this case is so damn complicated (it seems), I think nobody wants a guilty plea....I honestly think the feds WANT this to play out in court to show their power.

				In all honestly, my opinion is that he will not get bail. In the indictment in Maryland where he contracted the hit to the FBI agent, he paid out the $80,000 in two installments via a cash wire transfer from a bank in a different country. This means that he most likely has LOTS of money stashed somewhere, and would most definitely flee if given the opportunity. Remember, the feds said that he made aprox. $80 million in commission! Even if he only managed to get 1/10 of that amount stashed away, that&#039;s still $8 million!! There isn&#039;t a person on earth who couldn&#039;t retire at any age, and live more than comfortably on that for the rest of their lives, especially one as smart as DPR.

				He&#039;s never getting bail, no drug cases ever do let alone somebody going down for a hundred felonies. <br />His only chance is to plead innocent and have a trial, and hope that the NSA was involved in breaking into the server somehow so it all becomes fruit of the poisonous tree. I highly doubt this is likely though. <br /><br />I expect DPR to serve mandatory minimums for the hundreds of counts against him including the attempted witness murder charge, which lucky for DPR the govenor there repealed the death penalty 2 days ago or he would&#039;ve been eligible. Sounds like they purposely shopped his charges there to pressure him like they always do to plead out and cooperate. <br /><br />Even if he does cooperate fully he&#039;s looking at life minimum so might as well get your day in court, expose the surveillance machine and maybe sometime in the future can get your conviction overturned. If you plead guilty you are fucked. <br /><br />

				Lets hope not, but DPR2.0 could be going to a place where all terrorist go&nbsp; when they don&#039;t play nice.&nbsp; The things they do there to extract information is psychological and physical torture.&nbsp; EVERYTHING is wide open.&nbsp;

State law does not apply. The federal government has it&#039;s own death penalty separate from state law. Oddly enough large scale drug trafficking is a federal capital offense. SO he&#039;s not off the hook there.<br /><br />But I SERIOUSLY DOUBT that the death penalty is on the table.

They just have to show they have reason to believe that. And certainly could demonstrate why he would be a flight risk. It&#039;s up to the judge. That he&#039;s facing life in prison on one indictent and another 3 count indictment in a separate case involving attempted murder makes him a flight risk. Shit, I&#039;d haul ass across the Mexican border and work my way to South America if it were me.<br /><br />And on your second point, that&#039;s why no one ever gets out on bail on federal drug charges. Drug dealers are a &quot;risk to the community.&quot;<br /><br />And you&#039;re ignoring is 3 count indictment in Maryland. When they weigh the seriousness of all of the crimes he&#039;s accused of (especially attempted murder -- which was an attempt to kill someone who was a potential witness), they&#039;re not going too let him go.<br />
