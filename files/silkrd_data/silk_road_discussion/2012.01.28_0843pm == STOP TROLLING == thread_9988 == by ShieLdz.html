				How can we stop all this trolling?<br /><br />it&#039;s like half the posts I read are total bullshit trolling! It&#039;s getting to the point that its threatening the integrity of the forums, and even SR. For me honesty and integrity are biggies when it comes to picking an SR vendor and I have spotted a couple vendors going around trolling(even though I&#039;m sure they all have). I for one feel far less likely to do business with them because of it. I get the whole competition thing, but c&#039;mon!<br /><br />So again the question is how do we stop it? Obviously can&#039;t stop people from making new usernames. So what then? mayb a thread (stickied?) that calls out anybody caught trolling by name, or something like that.<br /><br />Suggestions wanted!

				@ Unbiased, good article. I thought it was funny to see congressmen and ceo&#039;s troll too! dicks!<br />However, according to that article it seems the only deterrent is for mod&#039;s to step-up and moderate the discussion forums themselves, which isn&#039;t going to happen I mean let&#039;s face it they got better shit to do. <br /><br />btw, just watched Back to the Future this weekend for the first time in a few years, and that scene at the end where doc brown says we don&#039;t need roads, I about shit, so fucking awesome! BTF is soo boss

				define troll?<br /><br />The way I see it, particularly when it comes to vendors comments, it is not trolling even if the comment or post is troll like simply because the vendor is not hiding behind another anonymous alias. <br /><br />I respect that even though I think the guy/gal is a nut job.<br /><br />99% of my posts could be considered trolling however its not..(maybe 2% is). <br /><br />Everyone has an opinion no matter how warped of insensitive and I think it is a mistake to classify it as trolling.<br /><br />Take this thread-<br />&#039;Dont ban guns ban stinking drugs&#039; ... could be considered trolling but maybe the op is just really emotional. He likes guns, He comes to SR to buy guns and not drugs. He hates drugs because they stink?<br /><br />IMO say what you have to say even if you dont think it is what the community wants to hear, but man up and take the criticism and advise on board.<br /><br />My biggest gripe in a anonymous community is not the trolls or mis-information, its the douche bag &#039;my dick is bigger than your dick&#039; attitudes. <br />I admit I learn a lot from these types, but I am going to troll/annoy(not bully) the bejesus out of them simply because I cant stand the high and mighty attitude of some. <br />Call that trolling if you must. I call it pushing somebody behind a keyboard to find out what they are made of. <br />Yes it is just all words, but you can learn a lot from somebody you may want to deal with physically.... like buy drugs.<br />I consider myself awesome(my dick is bigger than yours) at reading people. In the real world I am fucking excellent at it and I am getting good at it online too... (reading novocaine&#039;s post I consider him to be an arsehole however he does have a willingness to learn from you).<br /><br />Anyway...imo, if you think your dick is bigger than the rest of us you are worse than the troll or the guy with the stupid opinions.<br /><br />^^<br />stupid opinion folks

				Why not try to harness their energy and direct it at a common enemy? For example I&#039;m guessing that most people that are visiting this place are on the left side of the political spectrum. So post a thread here showing how fun it is to troll conservative or christian discussion forums. Then we can all have fun and laugh together at how frustrated those dumb christians get.<br /><br />Kinda like how Obama is going to try to unite America and prevent civil unrest by attacking Iran.&nbsp; :P

				The 2 most effective anti-troll measures on the internet are:<br /><br />[1] Reddit up/down vote (probably not an option here, so see #2)<br /><br />or<br /><br />[2] Bitcointalk style newbie jail. This is a sub-forum called &quot;newbies&quot; and newbies cannot post outside of it (they can read outside of it however). <br /><br />^ This framework is absolutely essential in an anonymous environment such as SR, because like DigitialAlch already said, without something like this, the trolls will be back within minutes.<br /><br />Here, look at the implementation: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=15958.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Due to a mass of trolling, only established posters are able to post in non-newbie sections. You are considered &quot;established&quot; if you have spent 4 hours online and have made 5 posts.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The quality of life, and overall atmosphere here at SR will increase 100x when such a system is implemented. No question about it. As a pleasant side effect, the newbies will be stuck in their sub-forum to learn all they need to know, *before* they come and re-ask the same questions that have been asked a million times already. <br /><br />The system is win for all, and shouldn&#039;t be a challenge to implement.

Another example, I read a glowing review from an American for an eastern European vendor, in which the [supposed] American spelled America with a &quot;k&quot;, similar to how an eastern european would spell it. ???<br /><br />Like I say, shit like that threatens the integrity of the forums overall. Now I only trust the opinioins of a few choice members that I KNOW to be legit

But, i think talking about it is hardly a vain act. We are bouncing around ideas and exploring available options. That&#039;s definitly a step in the right direction. I like what you were saying but couldn&#039;t a someone just make a few bs posts here and there as a &quot;newb&quot;, and then be free to troll as they please - masquerading as non-newbs. That might be worse&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />However it would probably eliminate a lot of the gpg/pgp posts&nbsp; 8)

				I think it&#039;s best to just ignore these people and let the mods take care of it. Trolls are like pimples: they pop out of no where and are pain but if you just take a deep breath, put on some face cream, and smoke a bowl everything will be okay.

If nobody pays them any mind, they&#039;ll lose interest and go search for greener pastures. This is a marketplace, after all, and the product they&#039;re after is attention. As long as people shower them with it for free, isn&#039;t it obvious that they&#039;ll stay?

				I don&#039;t read most threads, so what exactly are you talking about?:<br /><br />Is it people making accounts to slag off rival vendors in the hope it will swing business to them?

				LexusMiles has the right idea. <br /><br />Except we should call it... newbie intake. (Regular members can post there as well.)<br /><br />It works not just by number of posts but also hours online before one can post in the main forum. <br /><br />So figure 10 post and 3 hours online before one can enter the main forum. Both conditions must be met.<br /><br />The catch is the time spent online isn&#039;t simply leaving a browser up and being online with a clock ticking away. Time is credited with each click of a link or posts made. Say, each link clicked is worth 20s. A post made is worth 2 mins. <br /><br />Noobs don&#039;t necessarily need to post. They can read. In fact, it would encourage reading.

				This might be totally impossible, but it would be ideal if we could link the &quot;newbie-intake&quot; with SR accounts.<br />Like you have to log so many hours and/or make so many posts on the forums (like what BenJesuit and several other said) before you can even make an SR account. Then, you have to make at least one purchase from at least two different vendors before you can post outside of newbie-jail.<br /><br />I think this would help to stop trolling on the forums, limit scammers and LE on SR, and manage sudden influx problems due to increased publicity.

				Excellent additions by you BenJesuit and Sheilds4200....<br /><br />Stop by the Feature Requests section if you like: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10119.0<br /><br />I started a request for a newbie forum. No word yet but that&#039;s probably the place to speak and be heard.<br /><br />The name &#039;intake&#039; seems far most appropriate.<br /><br />The linking of SR main-site to SR forum-site might be a logistical problem for SR though. Just a guess, but the separation of the 2 is a significant issue in its own right I would say.
