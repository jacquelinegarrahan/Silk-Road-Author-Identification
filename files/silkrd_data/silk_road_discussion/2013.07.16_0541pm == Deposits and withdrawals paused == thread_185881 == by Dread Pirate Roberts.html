				Guys I&#039;d maybe give it some more time to make a deposit.&nbsp; Can&#039;t speak for withdrawals, but I made a deposit a few hours ago and 22 confirmations later I&#039;m still not seeing it.&nbsp; Things are probably still backed up and they&#039;re still working on it.&nbsp; Not sure how the last few people got their deposit through.&nbsp; Did you refresh and get a new bitcoin address before making the deposit?&nbsp; This is something I always do.&nbsp;

				I let DPR know several hours ago that this was still happening, so I&#039;m sure he is aware of it and working on it.&nbsp; Keep hanging in there - it will all get sorted!&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry for the delays though.&nbsp;

				DPR, please keep us updated. I&#039;m advising my boss&#039;s buyers to NOT deposit bitcoin into their accounts, and to also avoid withdrawing bitcoin from their accounts. The sooner this is solved, the sooner business can return to normal.<br /><br />Potential buyers that already have bitcoin on their accounts are unaffected. Buyers that have yet to finalize on their purchase are also unaffected.

Meaning all of my buyers will either go elsewhere or get sick.<br /><br />I was informed by Vendor Support this was fixed so I was re-informing them that its not actually fixed. <br /><br />I have heard back from Vendor Support again and those who care about withdrawals- if you don&#039;t have your coins in 12 hours- contact them.

				I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question but I haven&#039;t run into this before where deposits were paused. I did try to search for an answer but couldn&#039;t find the right search terms to locate an answer if it&#039;s elsewhere on the forums...What happens if you send money to your SR BC addy and transactions are paused like this? Will it go back to the sending wallet? Hang in limbo until the pause is lifted and then appear? Thanks for any info. <br /><br />*** UPDATE: My funds arrived. I&#039;d still love to know for future reference though if someone knows the answer and thanks! ***

				Ah, just read DPRs new post.&nbsp; Maybe &gt;6hrs behind on withdrawls, no big deal.&nbsp; Its nice to know where my coins are.&nbsp; Time to go pick some more mushrooms and check on this in a few hrs.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I&#039;ll throw some mushrooms in your tip jar if you want Trappy, you might get them sooner than your coins. :)
