				What are you even trying to say here?&nbsp; You&#039;re going to point newbs in the right direction???&nbsp; There are plenty of other posts out there that don&#039;t involve PMing someone that they can access very easily that do the same thing.&nbsp; Hell, you can&#039;t go to a section in this forum without finding at least one newb guide.&nbsp;

				lol, why all the hate for this guy? He seems to be trying to do a decent thing for noobs, offering them guidance.<br /><br />I&#039;m sick of all the noob threads asking basic questions over and over. Just the fucking nerve of some of them, expecting us to hold their hand and spoon feed them information. I would not have dared to ask those questions when I first joined. It just seemed disrespectful.

				I busted my butt to get over here to SR when I found out about this with no ones help either. Best way to learn is hands on. You make a mistake you learn from it with out any ones help, like I damned FE early and lost a bunch of damn money. Learned I wont do that ever again!&nbsp; Respecting SR is a big part too. So you lost a bunch made a terrible mistake on it learn from it and go on. I also learned in my past life you listen to people giving you advice just might be the wrong thing you ever do. How can you trust people on SR when it has a bunch of scams in the first damn place.

				Ya, when it comes to SR there&#039;s some things you may need a bit of help with, but for the most part if you aren&#039;t intelligent enough to figure it out for yourself do you really need to be here? This ain&#039;t fucking rocket science. Acquire bitcoins, deposit coins, buy, wait, get high. And do it as anonymous as possible. Oh ya, don&#039;t forget to learn PGP. That you may ask for help on. The rest, if you can&#039;t do it yourself, well I&#039;d hate to see what happens when your parents catch you.

				Fortunately my impulse control is still somewhat functional cause a couple of days ago I REALLY wanted to make a forum account for a guy called Max Sketch who would go around offering ludicrously bad (obviously cop-helpful) advice.<br /><br />It&#039;s possible I&#039;ve been beaten to the punch.

				Hey when did they add this captcha thing when replying? Is that just for newbies? I am not new. I started this thread and lost the password to that account. I was high lol and i aint no pussy christy. You all probly know who the fuck I am so thanks for the nice words. Like I have talked bad about you all but fuck it. I don&#039;t cry over what a bunch of brave anonymous people say. I still love you guys.<br /><br />Anyway Yea I was scrolling this forum and it started acting up then it goes to the screen for when you are trying a new thread? I didn&#039;t even click to do that and it would not let me do anything else so fuck it i started a new thread just so I could make forward progress. Guys I was attracting to much attention with my old username both on the forums and in real life. I was spending too much time here but I finally found a few vendors that I want to stick with and lay low. I am more than cool with a few of you knowing who I am. You won&#039;t me see me acting like a new visitor. I love this site far too much to be an ass.
