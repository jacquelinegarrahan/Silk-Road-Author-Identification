				I am very close to shutting down my vendor account, have had a few really crap things happen that keep bringing me down (scammed once, jacked once - you could say im too trusting or just a retard, I&#039;ve called myself both by now)<br />People on here have been very kind expressing they really are relying on me to stay here, but I am just out of options here - how can I get cash for my bitcoins?<br />Canadians cant take moneypaks - they cant take western union - so what should I do?<br />I&#039;d love to keep vendoring here but I am now at a point where my money backing me is gone and I can&#039;t hold out and wait any longer to figure it out.<br />Thanks a lot if anyone has advice it is appreciated.

				Sorry to hear it man.<br /><br />A number of vendors just offer mailed cash, purchasable with bitcoins, at some % knockdown from their face value. This might be the easiest option for you; not sure how much you need to cash out.

				U know anyone in the us you trust that can cash out for you. <br /><br />You could also buy stuff that can be converted to cash easily without deprecating in value. Like gold or something similar. <br /><br />There has to be a way for you. Man I wish I could be of more help. I just don&#039;t know enough about the laws in Canada to give better advise.<br /><br />Have you tried asking in the vendors form? <br /><br />Hate to see you quit. Sounds like you are working hard.<br /><br />U should start a thread about the guy who ripped you off so we can send him shame rays. <br /><br />Anyway I wish you the best and encourage you to hang in there. You will find an answer to your dilemma.

				Hey there,&nbsp; sorry to hear.<br /><br />I&#039;m Canadian.&nbsp; &nbsp;I use cavirtex.com exchange in canada and I have an account there linked to a bank account.&nbsp; I can sell coins and he cash shows up in my bank account .&nbsp; <br /><br />I know you need anonymous transactions as a vendor, but if you don&#039;t want to go through the huge hassle of linking a bank account to a bitcoin. Exchange (and the risks). Then just PM me and we can talk more.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d help you cash out in small chunks each day/week for a period of time (one month?) until yu are cashed out.&nbsp; Each small chunk would be transferred to whatever form you wish, cash in the mail(express post of course) or other form you feel comfortable with.&nbsp; You recieve a package each day or week( your choice) and yu don&#039;t have to send another until the previous one is received safe and sound.&nbsp; So there is no risk of loosing any large amount of cash.&nbsp; Anyway , whatever you feel good with.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think up something.<br /><br />You would be cashing out at market rate, which is great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know yet what I would charge you,&nbsp; I&#039;d add up the postage cost for sending the cash and the cost of shipping materials.&nbsp; So not much,&nbsp; I dunno we can find something.<br /><br />I live in a mortgaged home and trustworthy and easy to find.&nbsp; I also run a business listed in the yellow pages. So no worries.&nbsp; I only buy small shit of the road.&nbsp; &nbsp;PM if yu are interested.<br /><br />I&#039;d also be interested in your vendor account, if its for sale.&nbsp; You would of course clean it out first.<br /><br />
