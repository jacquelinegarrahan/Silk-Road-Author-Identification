				look, I was being a jerk and now I&#039;m trying to work it out with coach, but I NEVER asked anyone to leave bad feedback. One person did and then told me about it after to brag. Had I been asking people to do that, he would have gotten 30 5/5 on that free listing, but I didn&#039;t want to do that.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry for my behavior last night and when I get back from dinner I&#039;ll erase any comments. I also asked my friend to remove the 1/5 and make it right. I did NOT support that happening, and you falsely accused me, but thats ok because I had some drinks and was out of line and I&#039;m sorry for that. but I dont go leave bad feedback on free listings when I have literally 100 people who would do me the favor just to thank me for all I&#039;ve done for them.<br /><br />No hard feelings, and when I get home I hope we can continue to patch this up and make nice.<br /><br />PL

				Oh, right I did say I would get it changed since I knew who it was, but you told me if I did all that, that you would take down the listing, I simply was agreeing to your offer and am keeping my word on it.... so I said fine, I would, and so far I have. He changed it to a 5/5 and after dinner I&#039;m erasing the messages I made about this whole thing. No harm done.<br /><br />I deleted all my posts on NM&#039;s thread, and want to continue the civil chats we were having in PM. I do need to stand up for myself thouygh when you accuse me of leaving fake feedback. That&#039;s not the case, but all is forgiven if we can just move forward now.

				And I claimed it was merely a fan of mine trying to impress me. It was not me. If it was me you would have had 30+ 1/5 feedbacks. Now look man I have offered my hand in friendship over and over... slap it away again, and I will have no choice but to abandon trying to work this out.<br /><br />EDIT: I even had him change it to 5/5. I ALSO DELETED ALL MY COMMENTS. Are we ready to play nice, or do you insist we battle? I don&#039;t want to battle man, I&#039;m tired of that. But I always win, battling or partnering, I WIN! Let&#039;s partner and be friends please. Win with me, not against me. I beg you.

				So you want to put money on it? This dude is attackuing me, I&#039;m doing nothing but being cool. even asked someone to change feedback who was only trying to impress me. Who offers free ebooks to boost their feedback anyway? That should be the issue here. Trying to boost your stats for what?<br /><br />I have done nothing but try to cool this off and I kept getting made out to be the bad guy. I&#039;m playing cool here. <br /><br />EDIT: The sorry I was drunk comment was only to explain why I was so defensive towards him when he attacked me. I should have cooled it off from the start. I regret it and want to cool it off and be friends. I did not leave anyone fake feedback and even fixed the problem for him. We are cool now in PMs so this is over. No beef. It&#039;s all good in the hood now. So let&#039;s please stop the drama. I wasnt saying &quot;Sorry I was drunk so I left bad feedback&quot;... I didnt even know until someone messaged me explaining what he was selling and that he left him 1/5 for stealing my listing... I was drunk and kinda didnt take it well... but we resolved it, I got my buddy to fix it, and it&#039;s all gravy now. No beef, no war, all good. And I hope me and coach can be friends now cause we have things in common and I think we can benefit from each others friendship.<br /><br />I did nothing wrong, besides maybe handle myself alittle more offended than I should have been that someone stole my listing to start their vendor account and get a good rating for free... but it&#039;s forgiven and over with. So I forgive him, and I believe he forgives me based off our talks, it&#039;s all good. We all love scout too!<br /><br />I&#039;m not being defensive towards you coach, I&#039;m just getting these people who are attacking me to understand I didn&#039;t do some shit like that, and did everything to make it right, it&#039;s right now. I just dont like my name being drug through the mud. In the future I will make sure my loyal customers don&#039;t attack any competitors. I hope to actually help coach raise his rating legitimently. He sells legit products and if he will permit, I will help promote them and encourage my loyal customers to deal with him. He reminds me of me when I lose my cool, but also reminds me of me because most of the time I&#039;m a great guy and I think he is too.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s let this die.<br /><br />Side note which has nothing to do with this but just a joke: scout you know me, if it had been 25 1/5s, then I might look suspect. I get 30 messages a day from guys I could have asked for that favor it was a free listing, and I bet 29 of them would have. That&#039;s not me, and today I did everything I could to fix all of this.<br /><br />Aldog had a free coupon listing too, I didn&#039;t blow him up by asking people to give him 1/5s. I even sent a nice message to him and we had a cool chat.
