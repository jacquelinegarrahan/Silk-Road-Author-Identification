				You get negative karma for daring to express a view which someone happens disagrees with.<br />If you want to say anything that someone may disagree with, then set up another account and use it instead, and use your main account to say things that people will most likely agree with or not care enough to give any negative karma.

Coz everyone knows that&#039;s what people do and it&#039;s lame. <br /><br />Just use your one account and say what needs to be said, just don&#039;t be a dick about it. Simple. <br /><br />But yes, karma is handed out by people with 100+ posts. If you are helpful on the forums people usually give you Karma. So like a forum rating.

				Well you have -4 now...<br /><br />Looking at your posts to the forum in the time you have been here, I would say some are not worded so well. <br /><br />You come across as ignorant, not willing to learn, and for everything to be handed to them. <br /><br />No offense meant, this is just the feeling I am getting for your posts.

				i gave you + 1 as i do not believe in this beyond flawed system think about it. you need to post 100 posts doesnt matter what you wrote some people have conversations on here and add them up. the ones with the 100 + are older vendors and buyers. trust me they do not llike new venors appearing giving low prices ,having sales and an opinion. look at mine at one point i had -69. all from the hatters, i have 70+ sales i 1 month, had a perfect feedback, till 1 scammer messed that up REPULSE64 .all my negative karma was from pissed off competition who were upset i came in with super low prices and did great. for all you NASCAR fans its called the Jeff Gordon effect. same thing happened to him when he joined nascar, won all the races and the old racers and their fans got mad.

				TY for those sentiments morphineman. Nobody should give you -Karma for cheap prices, that&#039;s just wrong. And seeing that a lot newbies are getting more -Karma than +Karma, +1 to others (not all) on this page. If this is how Karma is going to be given out then perhaps we should not have it at all. It just leaves a bit of a bad taste when someone gives you minus with little to no cause.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94737.msg672905#msg672905">Quote from: PeterPanPB on December 20, 2012, 05:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was wondering what qualifies someone as a jr member and full member it looks like people with 50+ comments are&nbsp; jr members and 100 are full members?&nbsp; I applied to get vendor status and am waiting for them to get back to me.&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah those figures are correct. In addition, the catchpa disappears at full member which means less timeouts when posting. <br /><br />One thing though.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94737.msg672758#msg672758">Quote from: morphineman on December 20, 2012, 03:46 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you need to post 100 posts doesnt matter what you wrote some people have conversations on here and add them up. the ones with the 100 + are older vendors and buyers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Currently there is 72 hour rule where you can&#039;t give the same person any more Karma for 3 days. If newbies could give karma, it would technically be possible to kre-8 account after account and dish out quite a lot of -Karma on someone without making a single post. Some members start a new username just to post an unpopular thread or be a troll. Imagine how they would use this.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget, you can always get good Karma by making a post on the +Karma thread nomad bloodbath (the mod) started. I usually don&#039;t go myself, but give it a shot. Piece out. Drive safely.

				there are some like BLUEVEIL&nbsp; and EXTOsomething (probably much more) who give shit to a lot of new vendors/customers here on the forum. Try to sort that out now....<br />I know they give bad karma and trolling because the get karma and points for it. I asked and they admit it.<br />I think it is so stupid to scare young &#039;&#039;blood&#039;&#039; away but i am sure they want to keep their customers from going to the competition.<br />Personally, as a vendor, I am disgusted by that, Its like mafia ...a cartel and i think we, the community should not let that happen.<br />I think anybody who want to be a vendor has the right to do so...not only that, also get the help and support instead of being bullied&nbsp; and scared of.<br />A sr vendor myself have no problem with more sellers, even -of course- welcome them because it means more possibilities for everybod
