				Without a sort by price option, this sites users and vendors both suffer. New vendors trying to offer great deals often go unnoticed at the end of the pages, with no option to sort for their prices. Everyone goes with the entrenched sellers, but no other guys can make headway. It&#039;s hard to give good sales when no one can see em :-\<br /><br />As for buyers, the markets will isn&#039;t really translated here. No one has an easy way to tell that this guy sells cocaine for 190 a gram, when another vendor sells it for 90. Therefore the guy with the high prices gets constant business, while the smaller guy is back 3 pages and noticed by almost no one.What incentive do the big sellers have to lower their prices, when they show up on the first and second pages of results multiple times? There can be no competition until we truly can see what the actual value of an item is. This is supposedly Laissez Faire Capitalism, but that is impossible without the market being able to come to equilibrium. Again it won&#039;t happen until buyers can choose to snub high priced sellers, and actually make them compete

				That&#039;s interesting... I never really considered it from a perspective aside from user convenience (which is amazingly important from a business standpoint, but still has little to do with the actual market dynamics).<br /><br />You make a decent point.

				This is a good point and i have often wondered if i set up a vendors account how i could get noticed other than being quite active on the forums and getting to know people around here. What i can see is that people are encouraged to distrust everyone especially new &#039;kids&#039; on the block. Don&#039;t get me wrong, i agree with that but how else can you really get noticed unless your prices are very competitive and as dbz states you stock will be pushed back 2 or 3 pages to the back of the vendors page.<br />It seems to me as unless you have a good rep and are offering free samples to people to test out you have no real way of getting a good consumer base following you, especially with new people joining and forum and vendors list all the time.<br /><br />Definitely a good suggestion to put forward to the features requests board.

				Look of course you are gonna have to catch some eyes at first being new you are gonna have to give a little extra weight be on top of shipping and a active vendor, that means to be on the front page you have to everyday re list you listings.<br />you simply open a new tab on the add listing button and on the first tan open up your edit of a listing then you copy and paste the listing g and press enter.<br />There bam your listing is the first on in the section.<br />Vendors do this everyday, twice a day to stay on the front.<br />At first you are gonna have to make some ppl happy, it takes money to make money.<br />Read reviews see what is making the buyers happy and emulate or improve upon the concept.<br />A little free thinking goes a long way in this market. <br />This weeks news is next weeks memory, the market is fast and you got to move with it not let your listings float to the back page.<br /><br />my 0.02btc<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				I agree with this 100 percent. Competition is needed and is healthy for business.<br />I buy certain products on here and others I buy local because of the inflation in prices on this site. Vendors lowering their prices gets them more sales. They might make less per sale but with more sales comes higher profit. If some things did not have such high mark ups on this site than myself as well as others would order weekly and have this be our go to place for everything. But instead those dealers that for example try to charge over 100 dollars for a gram of coke, well you are only going to get people that are desperate. Lower your price to just above street prices that way you still make a buck even after sr&#039;s cut and guess what? You get 10 fold the sales you did before. You can sell 100 grams at 40 bucks profit a piece earning you 4000 dollars or sell 1000 grams with lower prices only earning you 15 a gram but the inflation in sales just gave you 15000 profit. Which profit would you rather have? Trust and believe if you have good product with a cheap price you will actually make ALOT more money. I know this from experience, and you vendors are only here to make money right? Well make it the right way!<br /><br />Having a sort by price will help vendor and buyer

				I kinda glad there isnt, because I was going through pages wondering around with my boy and something that we had been looking for poped up, randomly on the front page. But we hadnt seen any of the venders other listings in days, so I prefer for my vendors to stay well hidden. I mean I can name 3 that have blown up on here and left. I miss buddah

These forums have so much misinformation. <br /><br />Also people that are really buyers do not care about price. They care about service and speed of delivery(service). I know that is hard for people to understand but I can tell you with certainty that price is not an issue. They want consistent quality and speed of service. And at the the end of the day all the vendors price there items at about the same prices.( in drugs where you can compare the item such as pills). Yes you can find good deals(lower price) from a new vendor trying to get business...but eventually they too will have the same prices as the other vendors in there respective category&#039;s.<br /><br />To the OP, I understand what you are saying..but it is just not true. That has nothing to do with prices of items. Certain buyers only care about prices and they will find the cheapest. But MOST care about service and service only. By most I mean 95%.

				I agree with your overall point, RxKing, but I wouldn&#039;t really agree with your numbers.&nbsp; I do think that your interpretation of supply &amp; demand is too limited in scope though.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not obvious what the choices are, then it doesn&#039;t matter what the supply is -- it may as well not be there.<br /><br />What I&#039;m saying is that for every person who does not bother looking at every page of the listings, some of the actual, real supply does not matter because that given person did not even know it was there -- it makes no difference for their choice whatsoever, the guy&#039;s listing may as well not even exist for that purchase.&nbsp; Is it meaningless altogether?&nbsp; No, of course not, some people will see it and maybe it&#039;ll get pushed toward the front of the search results &amp; fewer people will miss it.&nbsp; But the point is that for every single person who does not check every single page every single time, the supply &amp; demand thing isn&#039;t even reflecting the reality of the supply.&nbsp; That&#039;s bad for the market (by western standards anyway).<br /><br />That&#039;s the real reason I think there&#039;s actually something to the point that it hinders competition and all that stuff that make the things here on SR generally cleaner &amp; more reliable.&nbsp; Nobody&#039;s asking for anything except the search function to accurately reflect the supply available.

				Yeah, it&#039;s obviously a feature that SHOULD exist. All these vendors that are actually trying to argue that it shouldn&#039;t exist are just blatantly biased and make it quite obvious with their weak arguments, and tone. Prices obviously aren&#039;t set by supply and demand very well on here since it is such a limited marketplace with pretty bad search functions. And a lot of people do care about price... idk how you could assume otherwise. Do you think there are THAT many people on here with an unlimited disposable income? Because that&#039;s probably wrong.<br /><br />Lastly, prices are going to get lower and lower on here as more people discover it&#039;s existence, and sellers get closer and closer to real, legitimate sources. You don&#039;t think vendors are going to start undercutting each other? They already do, I&#039;ve noticed the prices of many (most) items go down significantly in the 8-9 months I&#039;ve been on here. <br /><br />But anyway, whether DPR has the time to implement this &quot;nice, but optional&quot; feature, that probably won&#039;t really affect his bottom line, or security, is another question. He probably doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />

				&quot;Also people that are really buyers do not care about price. &quot; . yeah like buying black tar for 500$ a gram or some other ridicilous prices I&#039;ve seen. it would probably be cheaper to go to Mexico really..<br /><br />it would be perfect if there would be options lets say under two grams of exact substance and price either from highest to lowest or from lowest to highest.

Essentially we&#039;d have sort by price, and then another drop down that can be left blank if you want, but if you choose that it&#039;s the secondary sort category. So say you do sort by price/reviews, then you get a box to put in min review score(i.e. 85%, meaning no vendor with an overall rating of 84% or lower shows up), and then it sorts by price(high to low, low to high).<br /><br />That way you eliminate the vendors you that are shitty, or unestablished, yet you still get the sort by price. Win-Win

				That&#039;s true, if you could have secondary sort options it would be useful for the more specific categories. It might be kinda weird for the really general ones like &quot;stimulants&quot;, where there is such an array of various products sorting by price or qty would not help much. But if you get specific to pharms, or coke or whatever then it could be a help for sorting.

				This type of search feature was used for a while but did not work because some people price their items in Bits and other in Dollars. I have never had a problem with new sellers since about the only search I use is New Listings so the newest listed items are always shown first whether it is posted by a new seller or an old timer. The only way a new sellers listing are on the last page is if you search by seller rankings, if people want to find the best deals all it takes is a few minutes but as the old saying goes you get what you pay for and rarely do you find the good stuff for less.
