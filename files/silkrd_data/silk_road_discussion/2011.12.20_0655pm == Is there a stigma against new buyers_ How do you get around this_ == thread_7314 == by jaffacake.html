				Hello all<br /><br />I made, what I thought would be, my first purchase earlier today. I came back to check the progress of my order just now and it had been cancelled by the seller.&nbsp; :&#039;( I&#039;ve contacted the seller asking why they cancelled and I&#039;m just waiting on a reply.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just done a quick search on here and there seems to be a stigma attached to new buyers because some of them don&#039;t pay and try to get free drugs.<br /><br />How do I get around this?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :)

				If you&#039;ve never bought anything on SR before, you should try to establish communication with a vendor before ordering - just so they get the sense you&#039;re probably not a scammer. :)

				you can also finalize early if the seller has consistently gotten positive reviews. but as the above user said, communication goes a long way establishing trust

				Most buyers end up finalizing a few purchases early.<br /><br />Personally I feel fine with selling to new buyers, even 0/0 accounts, so long as they order something relatively inexpensive. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in buying a few clonazepam or dexedrine (and live in the US or Canada) I&#039;ll sell to you in escrow to help get your stats up.

				Before you make any purchases or communicate with vendors on Silk Road, you should learn what PGP (pretty good privacy) is. There is a free implementation of it called GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) which works on Windows, Mac and Linux/Unix. Google it, I can&#039;t remember which page I used to learn it, but there is plenty of information out there if you&#039;re patient and willing to learn. There are probably threads that discuss it in the security section of this forum.<br /><br />It basically allows you to encrypt your messages sent to a vendor using their own public key. It turns a message into a series of ascii characters, that once encrypted can only be decrypted by the vendor using his private key (which you don&#039;t have access to). If for example, you wanted to enquire about some illegal goods, and you don&#039;t want your message to be read by anyone other than the person you sent it to, PGP is the tool to use. Get used to it. Most vendors would prefer to use PGP, and not discuss things in the open. That way it protects you and the vendors words and identity, as long as yours and his private keys are never compromised. It&#039;s fiddly, but necessary. I encrypt all of my messages manually using the command line (in Linux). There are probably easier ways for non-tech-savvy individuals. When you look at a vendors page, he will have a PGP signature at the bottom of his page. This is his public key. You use this to encrypt any message you send to him. You will also attach your signature (which you create with PGP) to the message so he can send an encrypted message to you that only you can decrypt.

				i&#039;m a new buyer but lurked and studied up for a month before making a purchase.&nbsp; i think this is a good approach, becoming knowledgeable in protocol and quality vendors before starting business.&nbsp; i read the faq like 4 times.&nbsp; i just didn&#039;t want to go in blind like a friend of mine did..&nbsp; <br /><br />but i agree to a previous post that good communication is key.&nbsp; i really want to get to know my vendors and treat them as i do in-person dealers, which is very respectfully yet friendly.&nbsp; some of my best friends started off as my dealers.&nbsp; <br /><br />i strongly believe in the very concept of SR.&nbsp; i think this is a wonderful place.&nbsp; impersonal yet like a community.&nbsp; hopefully there are plenty of other new buyers that see it that way...<br /><br />*destiny*

				once you establish a relationship of trust with vendors you&#039;ve pretty much nothing to worry about. i have new users finalize early, but once they&#039;ve ordered for me a couple few times allow them to order without pre-finalizing.&nbsp; i &#039;ve built up my rep, its up to the buyers to build up theirs just the same.

				1. When starting buy small quantities from established sellers. Read the product description and seller terms carefully.<br /><br />2. PGP is highly recomended when buying. Learn how to use it properly. I recommend You to use WinPT together with GnuPG 1.4.x if You are running MS Windows. It takes some time to learn all options of WinPT, but when mastered it will make work easy and effective.<br /><br />3. Learn how the Silk Road works, so you are less likely to screw up something or will not lose your head when something goes not as planned.
