				I just wanted to make note that the man they arrested may have been known as the DPR. but the fact of the matter remains that HE DIDNT CREATE THE SITE, it was merely passed on to him by the creator of the silk road, whom im sure is much more intelligent (not stupid enough to ask help for coding under his real name then apply the code to SR) and *gasp* alive. and im sure he cared for his community a lot. who knows he may set up a new silk road under the same alias. unlikely, but possible. what bothers me is that the feds and dea havent posted about it on there websites, i went to the fbi website and there is a list of recent events that they&#039;ve performed and it isnt mentioned. also the SR LOGO on the seizure notice, that is&#039;nt something the LEA are going to do, i think that the original DPR placed the camel there to signal silk road users that he&#039;s doing something about it. just my crackpot theory on this all. tell me what you think.

				Well something is definitely off just not 100% sure what. It&#039;s odd they would shut down a site of mostly &quot;harmless&quot; drug dealers, when BMR is selling handguns and fully automatic AK-47&#039;s to any kid with $1500 in BTC.<br />Kind of fucked up if you ask me.

				yeah after doing extensive research on things i really think that DPR is pulling off an elaborate plan and slapping the LE in the face while doing it, yes granted we havent seen a DPR post all day, but wouldnt that be the point, hopefully he has the next new badass SR in the works and is going to release all of that on the d/l and also if he needs to hide, what is the best way to hide by making ALL OF YOUR COMMUNITY AND STAFF thinking you were caught, that buys you time to run when they think you are already in custody,, hopefully somewhere sometime soon he will surface and we will all know what is going on , but until than its just a waiting game, i just how his back up funds plan is working and people are getting paid, cause we all know that is a huge issue all the funding that was locked up, but i do hear some people are getting coins to back up address so maybe we shall see.

Thats the whole point, to make it seem like he got busted as aber stated. we could tell DPR was a smart guy. i couldn&#039;t see him making half the mistakes that they got &quot;him&quot; for.<br />3. Of course it was somebody affiliated with the site. thats what DPR planned. he made sure it was flawless. trolling the entire world in the process. (ofcourse this is all in theory)

				ok, i guess for fact the only people who know if there were more than one DPR is the crew that was tied to him and anyone who was in a close connection with him, if you look over the sites history and posts by DPR you can clearly see a change in style and design of posting which lead some to believe a change in ownership. that being said in article the current DPR claimed the original was paid properly for what he had created and the role of DPR was passed on, again i cannot say with 100% certain who is DPR and how many there are. but back to the seizure im just saying i think there is too many missing pieces of information after doing alot of reading to really think that this is over, there are to many things that these guys had set into place exactly for an event like this to occur, i am staying positive and i think in a few days DPR will resurface whether its the original or current or the only one there ever was i believe you will see something from him in the next few days. i have been gathering to much information that now leads me to believe that this is not exactly what we are all reading on the news. i am going to keep my fingers crossed, and if not DPR himself the next in line will step in, i still dont think they have exactly who they think they have, again could be part of a crazy plan we all just didnt see coming, we will see tho right

It seems the name of the guy they have now has been on the ticket since the start.<br /><br />This would be consistent with the whole bust being BS. Also if LE had control of the main site and took it down, why would they not also take down the forums as well?
