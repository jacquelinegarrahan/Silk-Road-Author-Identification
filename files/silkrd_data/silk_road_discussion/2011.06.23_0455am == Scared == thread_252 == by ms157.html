				this place is tame compared to topix by a long shot...Topix is the drug capital of the internet imo....no body gives a fuck about security there.this place is much more organized though and obviously way more secure which makes the world of a difference.

				How hidden do you believe you are? I am the least technical individual and it took me an hour to become a special dark internet vixen. Come on. I like the place for real though. I&#039;m intrigued being a part of a place that no one knows about. Just not interested in being a statistic, curiosity just may kill the cat. I don&#039;t care, need some excitement. We&#039;re hidden right? lol

				I&#039;m scared regardlesss of anything that leaves a key stroke and now that it has been publicized SR, I fear the end isn&#039;t far away. So be careful and suspicious of individuals and products that seem to good to be true and watch for the ones trying to turn a personal choice into profit, a personal war, an experiment or pure mainstreamism. I like that word lol. But I&#039;m not going anywhere. I haven&#039;t done anything wrong. This is free software and a free country. As for anything else I will keep my marketing and personal choices out of the view of computer and away from the administrators that may fall into one of the categories I mentioned above.

				think what a fascinating court case it would make!&nbsp; haha...just trying to explain what *bitcoins* are would drive lawyers from both sides crazy...most people can&#039;t hardly figure out what a computer does.&nbsp; And once we got off the gold standard, I&#039;ve yet to meat someone who could explain really well, why &#039;money&#039; is &#039;money&#039; haha...imagine trying to explain bitcoins... :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure I paid him with electrons, your honor...kind of... ;)

				Yep: Healthy fear is a good thing.&nbsp; Hard part, for me, is just getting some kind of priority right.&nbsp; I&#039;ve a feeling I spend way too much time on the digital side of things: you know, checking out different OS&#039;s, puttting TOR thru it&#039;s hoops, encrypting everything I can, getting all slowed down and pissed with varieties of VM&#039;s...all that is fun, but I think it distracts me from where the threat *probably* lies:&nbsp; a fake seller, gives up me address.&nbsp; All the digital hoops I go thru, I still can&#039;t find a way around that...getting a good drop zone/pick up spot...that&#039;s the real trick here....<br /><br />&#039;cuz if u get caught &#039;holding the bag&#039; and loose yer cool, they won&#039;t much give a shit *how* you got it...just the fact that you *do* have it is all they&#039;ll care about...<br /><br />That&#039;s what scares me.

				follow a few of the simple precautions that are on the forums buyer/seller guides and you wont have any problems.. dont sign for any packages you are expecting, dont use your own name, if possible use a different address for deliveries.<br /><br />also stay on top of the media.. what i do is go to google and search for silk road and watch the live results, this way any announcements from LE or federal you will know about quickly... from what i have been reading, they want to end bitcoins to stop the trade on here, what that says to me is they cant easily shut this down, because if the best plan they have is shutting down peer to peer bitcoin trading, that is a huge undertaking.. look at the first peer to peer, napster, sure napster was shut down, but the peer to peer network as grown to what it is today, and it can not be stopped.<br /><br />if this site goes down, others will pop up. if bitcoin is outlawed, more will be created. it is a new era

				&quot;Topix is the drug capital of the internet&quot;&nbsp; HUH????&nbsp; More like scammer&#039;s capital of the Internet.&nbsp; I suppose it&#039;s possible that a legitimate seller has operated there but I tend to doubt it.&nbsp; Just a cursory look around any of the drug forums there would give any sane individual the obvious impression that it&#039;s little more than a scammers paradise.&nbsp; At the very least I&#039;m certainly uber-suspicious of anyone who would try to portray Topix drug message boards as a place where legitimate buyers and sellers come together to do business.
