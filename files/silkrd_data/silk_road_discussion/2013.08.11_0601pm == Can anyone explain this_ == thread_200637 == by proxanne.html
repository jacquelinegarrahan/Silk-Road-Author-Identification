				Why do vendors that operate out of (for example) Germany, write their profile and item descriptions in English?<br /><br />For example:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/8fbe03ea77<br /><br />Vendor is in Germany, ships only to Germany, but item description is in English.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed this a lot.&nbsp; Does SR auto-translate?

				You&#039;d probably have to ask that person why he/she wrote it in English, I don&#039;t think there are mind-readers on this forum (or anywhere).

				You&#039;d be surprised how many countries speak and write English as a second or third language.&nbsp; It is apparent that majority of the site and users speak English, so this is where they see the ability to maximize potential sales.&nbsp; There is no translator for the site.

				Thinking tourism.&nbsp; BTC is international.&nbsp; So if 3/4 of your country speaks a second launguage that most of the traveling world also speaks/ reads, then u rule out a few and get a whole lot of others.<br />&nbsp;just my thoughts on it. i have no basis other than what i would do. :)

				Tourism explains part of it, Plus I don&#039;t know any Germans that don&#039;t have a grasp of english while there would be customers in Germany looking for bud who might not speak German.<br />If you setup in a new country and have no contacts and don&#039;t speak the language SR can be a savior. <br /><br />Second and the reason I use English even though It&#039;s not the first language in my country is LE. <br />Generally speaking the youth have a much better grasp of English so if the cops are going to bother to bust anyone who deals on SR in my country they will probably target ones who use the same language as 90% of the cops here speak bad or zero English and if they did I think the language they use could be a tell take sign :)<br /><br />For me it&#039;s just one more layer of security among many many others but cant be a bad thing

				I&#039;ve come across vendors writing their descriptions in German, Dutch, French etc.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re planning on selling products internationally, as most EU vendors are, you&#039;re likely to get more business if you write your item descriptions in English. This is because while a French person may not speak German or vice-versa, chances are that he will speak some English as a second language. Like it or not, English is quickly becoming the universal international language, if it can&#039;t be considered as such already.

				the last two letters on the end of that vendors name is a capital NL. i reckon that could stand for netherlands. possibly its a dutch firm working in germany who speak english but not german. or maybe not but that was my first impression.
