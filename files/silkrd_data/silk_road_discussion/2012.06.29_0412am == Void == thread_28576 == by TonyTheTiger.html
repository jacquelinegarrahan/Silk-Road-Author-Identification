				I would have to concur with the above gentleman or lady.<br /><br />MDMA is easier going though. I mean its always nice and there are no horrors if you are sensible.<br /><br />With LSD the euphoria is more intense and longer lasting.<br /><br />Also, you laugh on LSD, MDMA its more smile than crumpled up laughing and crying!<br /><br />I would not mix them though.<br /><br />And just another.<br /><br />Whiskey!<br /><br />Euphoria like coke for me - but that euphoria is followed by sickness and days to recover. I only get the euphoria when I have had too much.<br /><br />To be honest it is that damaging coke seems a better choice as you wake up the next day and can function.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				I don&#039;t know about shrooms and acid, I love them but I think any euphoria is equal parts confusion.<br /><br />First few years of&nbsp; MDMA doses hard to beat.<br /><br />However, as much as I hate to say it&nbsp; 4-MMC is pretty much the most euphoric single substance I have tried out of a very long list. Personally, I think it is an evil gutter drug that will no doubt give rise to some pretty bad long term health effects if abused. The short term effects were bad enough.&nbsp; But it is so euphoric that it makes you fiend like a mutherfucker.<br /><br />Will never try crack, but surely that must be the most euphoric gear around?

				Why would anyone not mix LSD and MDMA? If you&#039;re the type of person to experience anxiety from LSD, the MDMA takes care of that plus some. They&#039;re a wonderful pair, especially in emotionally intimate atmospheres.

				LSD &amp; MDMA&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Feel like I overdid MDMA when I was in my 20s, Ive probably had over&nbsp; 300 high dose sessions (as a very conservative estimate.)&nbsp; :o<br />LSD, had about 50 sessions before I was 17, took a break after my friend had a really bad trip and lost touch with my dealer. Never had it since other than a very weak one at a party.<br />I would add cocaine to the list but I give up on it these days, its all stepped on bullshit.<br /><br />Love to try DMT also... but I lack the testicular fortitude at this point in time.

				Oh yea I forgot about cocaine.<br /><br />The problem with that though is that it has to be REALLY good cocaine.<br /><br />Which is super hard to find.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t really tried ordering cocaine from the road yet, but if anybody has decent stuff my gut tells me its GoA.<br /><br />One way or another, if you have good cocaine, a small line will clusterfuck you for several hours.

				+1 on the MDMA/weed combo!&nbsp; I&#039;m not normally a fan of weed, but a little smoke about an hour into my roll is pure bliss.<br /><br />Thanks to SR, it&#039;s very easy to get good MDMA....so I&#039;d say the risk/reward puts MDMA as the best option for me.&nbsp; Just be sensible on your dosing.

				AMT followed by MDMA<br /><br />Ok so MDMA is pretty great euphoria wise, lots of lovey feeling to go along with it. Great party drug but often a bit of trouble sleeping, and come down isn&#039;t very nice (joys of a serotonin deficit). Also it can be a bit out of control in my opinion like a bit like loosing yourself which is fine if that&#039;s what you are after. I also find it quite moreish, ive taken over 1g in a night (not clever, i know) and that really was quite the experience.<br /><br />BUT my favourite drug for euphoria is AMT. Do a bit of research on erowid blah blah if you haven&#039;t heard of it (seems alot of people haven&#039;t) but its a psychedelic that lasts up to 12 hours (does include a slow comeup of up to 3 hours though) that provides pretty mild visuals initially but what really hit me about it was just how happy it makes me. Less stimulating than MDMA but imo far more euphoric and so so so much cleaner feeling. Not really any urge to redose, i personally have never experienced any negative side effects (vomiting prior to coming up is common). Also it has no comedown, at all. In fact i normally feel better the day after i took it than the day before. Final point, in the UK at least, it is legal ! Its a research chemical (illegal in the US) and at least in the UK its pretty cheap, huge amount of bang for buck. For me (using street prices, not SR which is really cheap for MDMA) a night on MDMA would cost £20 for .5g and i would be needing to constantly rehydrate throughout a night (makes for quite a sweaty drug), AMT would cost me £1.50 with no need for re-hydration. The choice is obvious (at least for me) =)<br /><br />I found LSD pretty euphoric but i think that was more just because i had been a little nervous before trying it, and i was just so happy and amazed by the visuals, really recommend it ! =)

				In my opinion Mephedrone and Mdma. I wouldn&#039;t mention LSD -I mean, sure it could be really euphoric, but it&#039;s a totally deep experience and personally I wouldn&#039;t take it if I just wanna feel euphoria and have fun...&nbsp; ;)
