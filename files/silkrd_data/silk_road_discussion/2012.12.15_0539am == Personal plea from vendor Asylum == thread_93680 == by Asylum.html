				This is a personal plea from Asylum.<br /><br />I have been serving the Silk Road community with freebase DMT and 25i-NBOMe for over 6 months.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c454ea9fd9<br /><br />On Friday my appartment was raided by Czech authorities and I was placed in a holding cell. I cannot explain how, but right now I am free, but not for long. I&#039;m currently on the run from Czech auhtorities with very little money and no place to stay.<br /><br />This is a plea for the Silk Road community to come together to support my escape from Czech authorities and possibly even my legal defense, if it comes to that.<br /><br />Please, send any amount to DELETED. Every little bit helps.<br /><br />I want my life back.<br /><br />Asylum<br /><br /><br />-----<br /><br /><br />The above was an original message from a hacker posing as me. <br />

				Yeah man you just managed to hop on TOR and have the capability to launder or somehow physically use bitcoins while on the run, all while maintaining good grammar while being in Czechoslovakia. <br /><br />So yeah, that sounds pretty sketchy.

				Vendor Asylum claims to be caught to scam then asks for money to get an even bigger scam?<br /><br />Asylum, either you are lying or you are fucked. The claim is that your customer&#039;s were turned over. That claim was made by your &quot;friend&quot; on your account, I believe? That means... you get no sympathy. You fucked them over. You are on your own.

				OK, I have to clarify the situation here. <br /><br />It was a phishing attack. I wasn&#039;t careful enough, they got my password and my they got my PIN. My forum password was then guessed since it wasn&#039;t too different from the password on the SR account. He didn&#039;t care to change the forums pass and I recovered it back.<br /><br />I won&#039;t start excusing myself or anything. It is embarrassing as it is... The truth is I could have prevented it. And I won&#039;t let the same happen again. <br /><br />On the other side, he did not get any personal details. He has stolen about 100 BTC I had in the account, put me into debt with SR by cash-advancing, canceled all my current escrowed orders, which were some 300 BTC atm just for the sake of it. But he did not get to any addresses, since I shipped out last orders the day before and he has closed down my listings shortly after getting a hold of the account. It was not an attack on me personally, it was just that I was amongst few who felt for the trap. He did not access my computer and there were no addresses he could see in the SR account. It pains me to admit, being a vendor and logging in daily to SR for the last half year, but it did happen.<br /><br />He has put this plea for donations to his address and few people fell for it donating him 37 BTC. <br /><br />I&#039;m now getting in touch with everyone who seems to have sent him the coins. I&#039;ll promise to pay them back after I&#039;m able to pay back the debt to SR. <br /><br />The lesson was paid for dearly. I&#039;m terribly sorry for the confusion and bad situation the fucker has caused and I&#039;ll make sure to not let such situation to happen ever again.

				As a fellow vendor this kind of news is the worse to hear. One of my worst fears is someone hacking into my account and I worry about it all the time. Everytime I try to login and make a mistake typing in my password, I think to myself &quot;Ah fuck, I just got hacked!&quot;.<br /><br />Thats why its always best to just memorize the SR url. Everyone should be doing this.<br /><br />Again, its sorry to hear this happened to you. But its a lesson learned. All of us get fucked over at least once on SR. Its really the only way to learn especially with something so novel as a drug marketplace.

				I normally have the link stored with other onion links and all potentially sensitive stuff on encrypted USB stick.<br />Well, that one day I wanted to just quickly check&nbsp; for new messages and didn&#039;t have the stick on me. Said what the heck then, let me just google it. The wiki pops up first and I use the link they provide.<br />It actually was quite a good attempt though. The design matched SR perfectly and they even got themselves an onion link starting with silkroad. I won&#039;t be surprised if they hit more accounts. Hopefully no other vendors, but I can imagine there are a lot of buyers who always use third party links. Little can be done about it except stressing the need to double check the link every time. <br /><br />I&#039;m not even mad, except at myself for giving him a joy. <br /><br />Money doesn&#039;t mean that much, I just hope to clear my name and keep going. The lesson was well worth it.<br /><br />And of course I won&#039;t use any link besides the one I memorize from now on.

				I&#039;m sorry Asylum for offending you (which i&#039;m about to do) because you&#039;re already embarrassed enough, but I don&#039;t understand at all how a vendor doesn&#039;t have silkroadvb5piz3r.onion memorized.&nbsp; <br /><br />You presumably log in regularly if your a vendor, and would quickly pick up the 8 characters after silkroad just through repetition.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t see how someone that logs on regularly doesn&#039;t have vb5piz3r memorized.<br /><br />Like to the point where I think you are either Asylum lying through his teeth, or the/some hacker that has control of Asylum&#039;s forum and is ... lying through his teeth.<br /><br />This is very bizarre because I don&#039;t know what your trying to extort from people or how your trying to do it within this thread.&nbsp; There is no doubt in my mind that Asylum has easily memorized the very easy sequence of vb5piz3r through attrition, I mean come on ....&nbsp; I would cut you some slack on memorizing the forum URL cuz it has a few more character&#039;s and you&#039;d likely not be visiting it as much as you would be the main SR page as a vendor, but there is no way a regular user and vendor to boot doesn&#039;t have vb5piz3r memorized, you&#039;re lying.<br /><br />What motivation or means is there here to extort people through blatantly transparent lies?&nbsp; I mean, my face is flushed with confusion and frustration for real right now as to how a vendor (aka regular visitor) doesn&#039;t have vb5piz3r memorized.&nbsp; There simply is no way.<br /><br />Are you lying to us to try and make yourself feel less embarrassed?&nbsp; <br />Or to make people who think you were in the process of scamming them (by leaving SR and taking the money from people who had FE with you) feel less angry?<br /><br />I am completely confounded by this.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; I just realized that there is one possibility, and that is that you put on a facade wherin you WERE the &#039;hacker&#039; and now that you&#039;ve got your account secured again you&#039;re feeding off the pity/sympathy/whatever word you wish to choose of other people asking them to donate to you re-establishing yourself, when you were never broken in the first place ... that&#039;s all I got ....<br /><br />And I only thought of it cuz I know there are several pan handler&#039;s actually leading stable, normal and financial sound lives but go out pretending to be a pan handler because believe it or not they can easily make more money per hour then a minimum wage job.

But I don&#039;t know how to defend myself further if you can&#039;t accept that. Any ideas, please bring them on.<br />More reading here: <br /><br />Reposted from my vendor&#039;s page:<br /><br />16.12 UPDATE<br /><br />I&#039;ve paid a hefty price for not being careful enough and falling for a phishing attack. The hacker did as much damage as he could before I was able to recover the account back thanks to SR support.<br /><br />What he has managed to do:<br /><br />1) Stealing BTC lying in SR account at the time.<br /><br />2) Putting me at further debt with SR by cash-advancing what he could.<br /><br />3) Posting a plea for help, claiming I was busted and in a need of money to run from authorities on vendor&#039;s page and on forums.<br /><br />- He managed to raise 37 BTC (over $500) in one day through that plea. Now, I&#039;m extremely grateful to you all who have responded to that...<br />Even if it was a fake, it&#039;s still a great feeling to know we&#039;re growing a supporting community and that if an unlikely situation comes, and I get busted, I know that at least there are people who care and some good has been succesfully done...<br />** If you&#039;ve sent money to that plea, please get back to me and let me somehow pay you back!<br /><br />4) Canceling all current escrowed orders. Now this served him nothing, but got me short of few thousand $$. <br /><br />*** PLEASE - if you receive your package, pay for it. Even if the order was canceled by him, I sent it out prior to that.<br />I&#039;m dependent on that money and have no other source of income. I don&#039;t expect all of you to pay, and you can easily just keep both the money and the product... I won&#039;t say a word. But I still hope the honesty prevails. ***<br /><br />5) Messaging some customers directly asking for donations.<br />- I&#039;ve contacted everyone I could see he messaged to explain the situation. If you had any communication with him during past two days and I didn&#039;t notice, please let me know!<br /><br />6) Deleting all my listings. Most had a history going back to 6 months and were on top in DMT category.<br /><br />** Most importantly though - I want to stress out that no personal details has been leaked. No addresses were stored anywhere on SR account.<br /><br />I&#039;ll dedicate the upcoming days to settling up anything coming from the situation and I won&#039;t put up new listings until everything is cleared out. Please feel free to drop me a message if you&#039;ve got any inquiries.<br /><br />I can&#039;t begin to say how sorry I am for that shit. Of course I could start thinking up excuses why that happened etc., but the fact is it all comes to not being careful enough when I had to. Stay safe yourself and all the best to everyone.<br /><br />The karma will take care of the fucker.

				This fiasco is another reason why you should always encrypt your address, no exceptions, and it blows my mind that 80% of SR users send their addresses in plaintext, according to stats provided by some vendors.<br /><br />We usually think of the main threat as being LE compromising the server, but mundane shit like this more likely to happen, and you never know who it&#039;s going to happen to. A vendor got phished. Luckily this time no addresses were stored on the account, but next time the phisher may try to blackmail everybody whose addresses he gets. Oh, don&#039;t want me to turn this info over to your local police department? 50 BTC please. And that&#039;s assuming the phisher isn&#039;t LE.

All good now - just a moment of concern...<br /><br />And yes I understand. The fact that I was already logged in, meant that that all the phishing site had to do was return to the SR index page or login page, and I would get displayed the index page I was logged in to.
