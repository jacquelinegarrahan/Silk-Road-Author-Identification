				I believe the story about British SR users arrest to be an over-exaggerated news in order to, as they admitted, instil fear into people who trade drugs in deep web, so they would no longer do so. I believe the drug vendors caught were real, but, they are not affiliated to SR. The affiliated to SR part was fabricated by the NCA in order to deter people from continue trading drugs in the deep web.<br /><br />1. Where is the proof that FBI was able to access all PM and addresses in SR?<br />2. There was a script made by a user which revealed all the usernames of members. I believe the FBI used the information from that script to calculate the total number of users. And also used the native scripts in SR.<br />3. The hire for murder was a sabotage by FBI spy, and the FriendlyChemist and readandwhite are bullshit fictitious characters.<br />4. Where is the proof that NCA and FBI was able to track British users by cyber intelligence, thus capturing them? The part about affiliated to SR was fabricated.<br />5. Where is the proof that the person caught in US was Nod? Nod was still active in the forum on the 4th October and he was supposedly caught on 2nd October you fucking assholes. Yes, that drug supplier is a legit bust but no fucking proof he is Nod. That part was a fabricated fart. <br />6. WTF was DPR thinking? Despite advices given, he refused to make the forum private and because of this flaw the day journalists and reporters came to the forum was the day FBI infiltrated SR. I can&#039;t believe everybody was praising DPR all the time with all the &#039;thanks&#039; &#039;you&#039;re the best&#039; &#039;you know the best&#039; &#039;take your time&#039; bullshits during downtime which in fact FBI was performing a server mirroring which led to the downtime. DPR was foolish by letting reporters and FBI explore the forum without registration limits.<br />7. There were a few DPR. Nobody shall know the real DPR because this business is supposed to be anonymous. Didn&#039;t he stepped down long ago?<br />8. Have you ever seen a seizure notice on a seized deep web page? Can&#039;t you tell who was the one who put up that notice? Do not say out, since it&#039;s a secret.<br />9. WTF will FBI do with the encrypted BTC which they cannot use? The part about Ross earning 80 million bucks was bullshit, Ross owns no race car, castles and shits, all he have is time go library with a laptop to use free internet. He doesn&#039;t even spend the money to go overseas or set up his own servers overseas. He sounds like a puppet. What do they mean by &#039;seized BTC&#039; and unable to seize Ross &#039;personal BTC&#039;?<br />10. Did FBI used SQL injections? Can any white hackers here explain one past incident where hackers were able to edit all the users&#039; images some time ago?

The affiliated to SR part was fabricated by the NCA in order to deter people from continue trading drugs in the deep web.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes I&#039;d agree that it is over-stated and primarily results from poor operational security regime (read: laziness) on the part of some vendors and one of the admins in particular (!) - something that we are all guilty of from time to time. There is a saying, attributed to the IRA but I think applies equally describes the LEO view of SilkRoad participants: &quot;You have to be lucky all the time. We only have to be lucky once&quot;. Often it is that one thoughtless action that compromises ones position - be it a phone call made from your home number, an unencrypted PM with attributable details and the like.<br /><br />For what it is worth, here is my opinion.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. Where is the proof that FBI was able to access all PM and addresses in SR?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well no proof, but according to the FBI criminal complaint the SR disk was imaged (copied and subsequently analyzed) by the FBI on the 23rd July 2013. Agent Tarbell states <br />&quot;During the 60 day period from May 24, 2013 to July 23, 2013, there were approximately 1,217,218 communications sent between Silk Road users through Silk Road&#039;s private message system.&quot;<br />Later he talks about specific content from DPRs private messages from March 2013 - 4 months prior. It&#039;s not proof but, assuming it&#039;s not all a big scam, it is good enough for me to assume that they have every single PM - but at least those from March 2013 onwards. They will probably have pulled these out of the database recovered from the SR disk image taken in July.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2. There was a script made by a user which revealed all the usernames of members. I believe the FBI used the information from that script to calculate the total number of users. And also used the native scripts in SR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well it is certainly possible - I haven&#039;t seen any evidence to suggest they did but yes very possible. Once they had the SR server image though in July 2013, they had everything - all users, profile info etc. there was a hack back last December, allegedly a SQL injection hack, remember the SR Quickbuy image scam? Well if it was a SQL injection attack then in all probability, the attackers back in December could have mirrored down the SR database which could well have provided the attacker with everything on SR at that time - speculation though.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. The hire for murder was a sabotage by FBI spy, and the FriendlyChemist and readandwhite are bullshit fictitious characters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Don&#039;t have enough info to call that one - the accounts may well have been agent provocateurs, certainly fits the MO of the feds.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. Where is the proof that NCA and FBI was able to track British users by cyber intelligence, thus capturing them? The part about affiliated to SR was fabricated.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well they do have addresses where they were sent unencrypted in SR. Also remember they probably have every TORMail message from the FH bust in August 2013. i am sure that with just the contents of SR and TM alone, you could pull out hundreds of individuals. All it takes is for someone in a Tormail to send a phone number in the clear and bang - games up. Once they have a real-world link like a phone number they have you very shortly afterwards if they choose to put the effort in - and once your line is warranted, if you are still using it, that&#039;s game over and possibly anyone associated with you who is worth talking down. Cyber intelligence though is a bullshit buzzwod. Yes certainly SOCA make very good use of NTAC but there is no magic - internet taps, phone taps, location and call records - the usual. They may even break into your wireless network but if they are at that stage&nbsp; then they are parked outside and already 100% on your case. Like I said though, they don&#039;t do magic - just exploit peoples laziness and ignorance.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5.

DPR was foolish by letting reporters and FBI explore the forum without registration limits.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>But anyone can register an account both on SR and the forums right? If they wanted to mirror it they would have anyway.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">7. There were a few DPR.

And I do find it strange (I have already posted why so won&#039;t do so again). Whoever posted the seizure notice just modified the existing SR server which I find very very strange indeed.....they also cleaned up evidence of that on sunday morning just gone....<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">9.

Some FBI intern will probably nick the wallet at some point but for now I&#039;m sure its been labelled up as secret and locked away in a big safe. And 80mil? Well - maybe in todays prices. Remember bitcoins weren&#039;t worth that much even at the start of the year and much much less back in 2011. Every man and his dog had a wallet with a couple of thousand bitcoins in back in late 2011.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">10. Did FBI used SQL injections? Can any white hackers here explain one past incident where hackers were able to edit all the users&#039; images some time ago?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ah that one again - they certainly could have and as I said above, that probably would have given them the ability to mirror the entire database back in Dec 2012. Maybe whoever did the hack (assuming it wasn&#039;t the feds) - sold the copied database to the feds back at the start of the year or perhaps a little later.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think TOR or the hidden services are broken, I am fairly certain they have to rely on fuckups and carelessness but hasn&#039;t it always been that way?<br /><br /><br />

Don&#039;t sweat it too much - just be prepared. If the only evidence they have is the contents of SR and Tormail then so what? That data could have been produced by anyone - and your account could have been setup by anyone and anyone can put your address into an order. It&#039;s not enough on it&#039;s own but you have to be ready.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve got half an hour to kill then read the criminal complaint in full<br /><br />Clearnet: http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/801019/ulbrichtcriminalcomplaint.txt<br /><br />all the best<br />

				I do not agree that FBI have access to all the PM. I think that&#039;s assumption. The reason why they got DPR&#039;s PM content was because there were several FBI spy decoys which exchanged PM with him in both encrypted and unencrypted PM.<br /><br />Can anyone quote me the exact words from the FBI in regards to the most sensitive data they have obtained from SR?
