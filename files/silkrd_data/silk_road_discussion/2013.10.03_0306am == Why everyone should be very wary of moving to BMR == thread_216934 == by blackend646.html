				I just want to remind everyone that one of the many reasons BMR never took off as a viable competitor is their inclusion of &quot;Automatic&quot; encryption. This should come as a pretty large red flag, as it communicates that you do not need to bother encrypting your address manually. Everyone should consider the possibility that this site is a honeypot to harvest addresses. <br /><br />I know everyone is in panic mode and I understand the temptation to make an immediate switch to another site, but please for your own safety be cautious. If you are going to make orders on BMR, be sure to encrypt your address manually on top of their alleged automated feature. PGP as absolutely essential and for the reason I have outlined even more important to use on BMR than it was here. <br /><br />Ideally I think the best course of action is to buckle down and wait a few weeks/months for the dust to settle. We are vulnerable right now, and it is prime time for people to come along with scams and other things far more malicious. Personally I will be staying away from sheep market as well, if for no other reason than the name rubbing me the wrong way entirely. <br /><br /><br />Stay safe everyone, it&#039;s been a pleasure knowing you all and I hope we as a community can find a new home soon.

				You can still manually encrypt, and that should be common sense to do so. It is better than plain text. I cant tell you how many people turned over all info on them not just their address in plain text without even using privnote atleast. BMR is the best bet IMO, many people have ordered and sold there in the past. We need a plan B. I know i would not know what to do without the business brought from SR, people trusted escrow and were iwlling to take a risk making purchases they would not normally make. It is and will always be a great system. The sheep place seems like a huge red flag, i personally will never sell there in my life. BMR has been waiting for this and i think its time we give them a shot, they have always been our unspoken plan B. They will make the system better if they have a good amount of vendors/buyers there. Just like SR improved over time.

				What&#039;s BMR&#039;s address? I&#039;ll check it out and bookmark it at least. You never know, the trusted vendors on here might make it a good site. Have it&#039;s owners mentioned anything about SR being shut down? It seems like it would be good business to offer condolence and help to this community.

				I just registered on BMR and agree the &quot;auto encrypt&quot; thingy seems untrustworthy. With the site handling the encryption keys like that, all communications could easily be seen by a &quot;man in the middle&quot;. Personally I&#039;m gonna wait to order until I see a vendor who&#039;s PGP key I already have from SR (and I&#039;ll be encrypting everything myself too, nevermind their site-managed encryption). One other thing I thought was a little sketchy was that BMR has a CLEARNET link (www.bmreloaded.com) that automatically redirects to their Tor .onion site. I mean, how the hell does that domain stay functional (and not get shut down) when it redirects to a known darknet drug market??? I&#039;m gonna have to lurk there for a while and do some research before I even consider ordering anything.<br /><br />btw, that SHEEP marketplace is one I wouldn&#039;t touch with a 10 foot pole! Besides looking like a complete joke, it apparently only costs like 30 bucks create a vendor account (can you say SCAM CENTRAL!?)

				Hello everyone.<br /><br />This is very very sad :( <br /><br />Many of us lost money, some even a shitload of it, but all of us lost a great marketplace. Very, very sad.<br /><br />Regarding BMR:<br /><br />This is their URL:<br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php<br /><br />And this is their forum URL:<br />http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/index.php<br /><br />The forums have been nowhere near as active as SR forums have, but I think it will change pretty soon. I think BMR will see tremendous growth in the near future, and I believe it will be the choice of many vendors and buyers. Backopy (the site administrator of BMR) has in fact closed the registration for now due to needed &quot;upgrades&quot;, probably there has already been a huge influx of new people. I hope they can keep up with this.<br /><br />Regarding the automatic encryption:<br />You can turn the feature off if you wish and encrypt manually. This is off course what I and all the other people are recommending. But many wont do it, we all know that. Many did not encrypt here in SR, those will be the same people. But think about the situation those people are in now if they had pending orders in SR? Their addresses will be there for the feds to read in plain text (at least that is what must be assumed), where as if the feds seized BMR:s servers, they still could not read the addresses. <br /><br />There is a difference, the security-oriented buyers are safe in BMR and were safe in SR (because of manual encryption), but those less security-oriented buyers are now fucked with SR, but would be relatively safe in BMR if there ever was a similar situation.<br /><br />TL;DR:<br />My point here is, that customers who are worried about their security are &quot;always&quot; safe, but those that are not that worried are safer in BMR than they were in SR.<br /><br />PS:<br />I really hope the SR forums get stored for future reference somewhere. Lots and lots of great info here.
