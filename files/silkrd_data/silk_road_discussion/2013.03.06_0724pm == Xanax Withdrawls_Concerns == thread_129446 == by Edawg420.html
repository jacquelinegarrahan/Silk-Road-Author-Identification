				So the title says it all, i have recently decided to play around with Xanax and god has it been fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually i would take it to sleep now i take it to be drunk without the sloppyness of actually drunk.&nbsp; I love the I font give a fuck attitude.&nbsp; Now i am completely aware that benzos develop a physical addiction but at what point is this and where is the no later than point?<br /><br />I usually take weeks off but lately i have been popping 4x2mg Xanax&#039;s for a nice 9:00pm sleepy fun time adventure.&nbsp; Now sure i feel groggy in the morning but nothing outta the ordinary.&nbsp; And it certainly beats alcohol hangovers.... So i&#039;m curious, will taking 8mg of Xanax every night develop and dependency quickly or is that kinda a normal dosage for sleep aids?<br /><br />I should mention i do party with em on the weekend by taking 5-6 and getting zombied out.&nbsp; Now i know that is bad so don&#039;t even bother explaining that to me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t however drink because that is the dumbest drug you could possible do.&nbsp; ESPECIALLY with so many other fun ones.

				With 8mg/day of xanax you will acquire an extreme dependance. You will be very addicted, and require tapering to come off it without serious withdrawal effects (seiures/death) and it will still be hell. You will also probably suffer permanent consequences in the future from that dose every day, such as anxiety issues, etc. 8mg/is a lot.

I have been through opiate withdrawal and this is right up there with that, just not physical. you will be fine after you get through it. you are taking an amazingly high dose imho. i would suggest to down the dose, cold turkey really isnt an option with a high xanax tolerance.. if you start trying cold turkey you will see what i mean.. it drives you insane. best of luck. let us know how your holding up.

				Once you have been taking Xanax regularly and have a habit you should taper off using Valium. i was prescribed xanax for several years and for various reasons (taking more and more and still having anxiety) decided i was going to quit cold turkey. i didn&#039;t want to tell my doctor, he would think i was some kind of junky, right?. So i stopped just like that, and let me tell you it was the WORST withdrawls i have ever had. Major body aches and pains for about 2 months, as if i had been beaten, worse than boot camp sore. And there were times when i thought i was going mad, for me benzo withdrawls were much worse than opiate withdrawls. Took a few months total, make sure and research it on google. They say that the two things people die the most with during withdrwls are Alcohol and Benzos, be very careful if you are dependent on them, seizures and death are not uncommon. While at the Dr.&#039;s he was writing me scrips and i said i didn&#039;t need the xanax he asked why and i told him. He scolded and lectured me for 3 or 4 minutes about the dangers of it. Good Luck

				Ahh xanax, i have had some pretty terrible binges and come downs off xanax. But i just love them..it&#039;s a mix between being really stoned and the ego and carefactor or coke. The fucked thing with xanax is i can&#039;t remember half of the stuff during that bender.<br /><br />Just watch out and dont go over board, the comedown is pretty full on depending on how much you take. I was going through 50 x 2mg a week..sometimes less. So easy to do.

				well 8mg is a lot. But its good that you are getting off it. I think you should try other benzos to avoid dependence. 2mg of klonopin will rather do the trick instead of 8mg xanax.

				man homey i know u don&#039;t want WD&#039;s lol. They&#039;re exactly like opiates I assume. I never knew if I was offically withdrawing from xanax because I was always on opiates . Xanax def gains tolerance quick tho. I cant even fk with the 1mg xanax cuz i just end up eating 30 and im forreal 30. I don&#039;t even get a &#039;high&#039; anymore on xanax. Its seriuosly a cool drug but doesnt last long plus everything that ever happened that was bad was when I was on xanax during my drug life.<br /><br />indianpilldaddy is right about klonopin. Its def less addictive or something of the sorta. Some doctors give that with suboxone in the US to help sleep, even tho benzos and suboxone is not recommended in a major way

				I just ate 2mg and drank a beer, and I am feeling good, and I will sleep like a baby, and I sleep like shit....and I have hit the stuff pretty hard at times. Please take care of yourself man. 2mg is more than enough and if you take it everyday you will become a slave to it. It is a soul sucking drug. Tolerance and dependance builds fast and it rough. I took 2-4 mg/day for a week and a half or so and stopping was not fun.,

				I&#039;ve been eating the ladders also. I actually think I like Diazepam and Lorazepam more simply because Alprazolam is just priced way too high simply cause so many people want it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that 4mg per day is a general threshold for serious physical withdrawal symptoms. I do not take that much anyway. If you&#039;re looking to feel retarded, try potentiating the drug with something like Hydroxyzine or Diphenhydramine HCL. Both these drugs are known to potentiate the Narcotic effects of heroin (Dormin is a common street cut which is just another Benadryl). I find it helps with Bezos for me also.<br /><br />I would NOT be taking 2 ladder bars per day.<br />You&#039;re just asking for trouble.<br />A beginner Xanax dose is 0.25 Milligrams. Your doc MIGHT give you 0.50. You gotta be a special nutcase to get those ladder bars.<br />but that is my opinion.

				Hey Edawg, dude, please, fuck off from the bars. Your one of my favs around here, and I would hate to see you fall victim to the unforgiving Xanax. <br /><br />&nbsp;From the sounds of it, your already taking too much. Im sure loads of irresponsible fucks that really could give a shit less about your well being, will tell you its fine, but man ive been there. I was at one point taking up to 18mg per night, and it was a 5 or 6 day a week thing, the only reason it wasnt a 7 day a week thing, is because at any given time id have so much damn xanax in my blood that all i needed was a blunt, and i was 7 kinds of silly all over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;They are good for minimal use, before bed at low doses, or when your needing to come down after a night full of L or anything else that makes your nerves jump. Also im sure you feel like its less sloppy than being drunk, esp when your all sticked out..youd think your on fucking point, but in reality are looked at like the village drunkard. <br /><br />Aside from the pep talk, they are very bad for your body. I have had 2 seizures from withdrawal in the past. Since them ive vowed to never get into them again. The most ill take now is maybe 1mg before my bed time joint, and even still, i usually regret it. They fuck your memory, they give you terrible temper tantrums and morning after rage like no ones business. I can name a list of shittyness that they have provided me, but ill save your ears from bleeding. The ultimate testament to how bad they are, is all the scars i have on my body, almost every one from the past 10 years is a direct result of xanax use. That idgaf attitude they give you, only breeds problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;Do as you wish of coarse, just know that im concerned for your health and well being, and if i where you, i cut that shit out, fast. The least ease up greatly. Much, much love brother.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I saw a guy last week who told me he was on 3.5 millagrams of Xanax.<br />The guy was unbelievably stupid!<br />You think you&#039;re acting just fine when you&#039;re like that (similar to drinking)<br />But everybody around you Hates you (more likely than not)<br />However you&#039;d be none the wiser because you feel like you&#039;re king shit.<br /><br />You&#039;re playing with Physical Withdrawals.<br />That means your body became so used to that chemical that now it believes it needs it.<br />If you want to play with drugs which cause this, I recommend Heroin. <br />It is way more fun!<br /><br />Use Xanax sparingly.<br />Xanax causes &quot;Rebound Anxiety.&quot;<br />A person taking it for Anxiety will fill worse after it wears off.

				u can get off them easy<br /><br />start taking fish oil pills and some 5 micro gram over the counter ( non prescription ) lithium orotate pills.<br />this is not lithium that is prescribed to phycos&nbsp; but an over the counter pill that allows u to have<br />the same necessary lithium u need and get normally in your diet if u r eating lots of veggies.<br />it is made by mixing lithium with oratic acid - that is in mothers mild and naturally breaks down the lithium<br />to absorb-able by the body lithium.<br />everyone needs lithium in their diet and this is the best way to get it - through mothers milk.<br />the pills will work just like this but for maximum effect u need to use the fish oil in conjunction.<br /><br />lithium is necessary&nbsp; &nbsp;for the body to have a proper brain chemistry .<br />i take it every day - works for me<br /><br />peace out;<br />Christy
