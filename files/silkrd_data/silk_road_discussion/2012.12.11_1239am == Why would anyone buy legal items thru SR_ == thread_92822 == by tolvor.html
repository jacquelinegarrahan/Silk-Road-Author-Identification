				Etizolam is an example of something thats legal in the US over the counter, but just isn&#039;t made anywhere in the country(or continent, really,) and even if you do find a source, either domestic(good luck) or abroad, most of them seem somewhat sketchy, and most only accept western union type payments. I&#039;ve been thinking about trying it, and could get it from one of the clearnet sources I found for a bit cheaper, but none of those sources offer me anywhere near the caliber of protection that SR&#039;s escrow system offers me, and I might just end up getting scammed.&nbsp; So there&#039;s one situation.

				I would be wary of buying physical goods and having them shipped to my house. LE can&#039;t distribute real drugs so it would be hard for them to pose as a vendor for long without shipping anything out. They would quickly be labeled scammers. However, they could sell legal goods to harvest buyer addresses and operate like that for months. I would only buy legal digital goods on SR and download/access them over Tor.

				Either that or when your buying your legal goods check there profile page and see what else there selling, or if there a decent enough vendor who has been on SR for more than a cpl months. Obviously if they&#039;ve been around for a while and also selling illegal goods they arent LE or harvesting addresses for LE. I understand you can never be to cautious but at the same time when are you being over paranoid?

				I mean and it doesnt even necesarily have to be legit legal goods, you can buy scales and pipes and baggies. Granted if it does get looked at for whatever reason it could send a red flag but at the same times its not enough to prosecute you or deam necessary for a warrant.

				Vendors accumulate a great deal of BTC that has to be cashed out. Cashing out (i.e., money laundering) is risky as hell.<br /><br />Buying legitimate goods on SR (or any bitcoin site) is an easy way to convert BTC to something tangible and liquid, without the risk of setting off AML alarm bells.

				I doubt many vendors will share their cash out methods, as this is one of the riskiest parts of the process. Based on what I&#039;ve read on the forums here (&#039;I got scammed threads&#039; mostly) and some site called HackBB ( http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion ), here are some methods<br /><br />Bitcoin exchange -&gt; Bank Account- Ok for small amounts. Small transaction fees. No go for a&nbsp; vendor that needs to process more than a few hundred a week. KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) laws require way too much personal info.<br /><br />Sell Bitcoins for cash-in-mail on SR- some (anonymous Internet) people swear by it, looks like high potential for scams though. Large transaction fee<br /><br />Sell Bitcoins for moneypak- Quick and easy if all precautions are taken by the seller, high potential for scams if not. Large transaction fee<br /><br />Buy prepaid debit cards, amazon gift certificates (they sell just about everything you can&#039;t buy on SR anyway)or payment card type financial instruments on SR- Potentially an anonymity threat, If I were LE I&#039;d be the money changer (selling cash != selling contraband, so better option for sting than posing as illegal goods vendor) and get the credit card companies to track all the accounts. <br /><br />Buying precious gems, gold- more difficult to convert to cash, might be a better option than stuffing into mattress if you&#039;re flush though. Gems can be occasionally be tracked (I believe the have etched serial numbers in them for the expensive ones), gold cannot if melted and reformed. Large transaction fee.<br /><br />Sell bitcoins F2F (like through a local bitcoin matching service)- might work in a high population area, probably not reliable enough for more remote areas though. Lot of labor to meet people though. No transaction fees that I know of, but you&#039;ll have to pay for gas and time. <br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to know what methods people use as well though.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

What point would that serve? EVERYONE in the US is likely to be a drug buyer. It&#039;d be more interesting if the DEA could harvest a list of the few American residences that would never consider buying drugs.<br /><br />The only reason law enforcement ever targets buyers is to attempt to get information on vendors. Silk Road is a system whereby the buyers don&#039;t HAVE any information about the vendors. They cannot snitch on anyone, so law enforcement would find targeting them to be a waste of time.
