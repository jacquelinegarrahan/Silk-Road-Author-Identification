				accessing the forum is nice and quick / acceptable, whereas the SR site is not...<br /><br />an observation if someone knows how to go about fixing that,<br /><br />Thanks<br />&nbsp;:-X

				Ive noticed the same thing. Im sure its because of the different traffic. only a few thousand are registered here while there are well over 100k registered at the market. so, its all about the traffic... (I think)

				my friend who is into computer science also pointed out that SR is very image laden. that may be a factor as well (perhaps a less significant one than overall traffic). additionally he posited that the timing out could be a security feature of some sort. i don&#039;t know enough about computers but it seemed reasonable to me.

				It&#039;s because SR has higher traffic and a higher number of simultaneous connections.<br /><br />Due to the way hidden services are designed, at some point all that traffic - and all those connections - go through a bottleneck of a single, shared node that is also relaying other traffic. A node may get congested with close to 1000 to 2000 connections, or traffic can get backed up due to bandwidth demands and time out before completion. Keep in mind that 1000 connections doesn&#039;t even mean 1000 users, as each page load opens up several http connections, and Tor keeps those circuits open for 10 minutes.<br /><br />There are some solutions to alleviate the situation, but they are custom, complex and expensive.<br /><br />Give SR some time to adapt and design a more robust system; it&#039;s not going to happen overnight, but I guarantee you he is working on it.
