				This is an email I got as a vendor today:<br /><br />Good morning Silk Road vendors and buyers, my name is Rossetta. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Silk Road.<br />Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week, and that there has been some strange goings on since it being back online. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this, many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.<br />I will tell you that domestic rate options are one (choose to view in EUR &amp; GBP as well as USD) and also a new exchange feature will be implemented next month. We have also added more admin accounts which will be better staffed to assist you.<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. This can all be verified with DPR&#039;s forum post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138016.0 Or message him here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/b1e30b5819 Please do not speak about this on the forums yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; Dread Pirate Roberts share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$250&#039;000 per month or $2&#039;900&#039;000 annually Shares will be priced at 4BTC for a 0.1% share, paid in btc. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.<br />There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $250 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types.<br /><br />Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your SR account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.<br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it.<br /><br />Payment address - 19nMy9FkmFB9RhUXvLZnwgmeCrZbV36ndo<br /><br />If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.<br />Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging SR Financial here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/733d1d49e8 with your Transaction ID, User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total btc sent.<br /><br />Example Subject - SR Investments<br />277349296<br />Rossetta - 4 x 0.1 - 16BTC<br /><br />This is strictly first come, first served. As, said before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.<br /><br />Current price is 4 BTC per 0.1% share. This will reward you with around $250 per month. This may well be subject to increase.<br /><br />Thank you and good luck<br />Rossetta SR Staff <br /><br />I got an almost identical message days ago. Dodgy fuckers. Saying dont mention it on the foums, ya fuck you.<br /><br />Scamming cunts. <br /><br />Here is my reply:<br /><br />You fucking Cunts. Not the SR staff of course I kneel in front of them motherfuckers, would never criticise them. Im not talking to them tho Im talking to you CUNT FEATURES. This is going in the forum alright. Fuck off sending this shit to me, I get 1 every 2 days.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CUNT.<br /><br /><br />Anyway vendors keep your eyes out for this crap, most will know but dont want some one getting scammed so this is for noobs really.

				Yes, the above is a scam that has been doing the rounds for quite some time. Silk Road will NEVER send you messages like that, nor will we ever ask you for your PIN (in case any of you ever get messages asking for that!)<br /><br />Libertas

The only thing is I am almost exactly 0.03 of a bitcoin short. I would really appreciate the help. Next time I will NOT let this shit happen so I DEF. am not going to be short. Thx and I would really appreciate this a lot sir if you can send the 0.03btc to my sr username so i can purchase.<br /><br />Yesterday or the day before it was a message about video footage and going to some site obviously you just leave them.

I have loads of these recently, way more than usual. At the moment Im getting these stupid fucking adverts about 20 messages a day all for viagra say 0.343458688866 bit viagra bullshit all from different names saying the same shit. Some dicks made a programme that keeps opening new profiles spam advertising and opening another and doing the same so SR are going behind them deleted accounts but they cant stop them keep making new ones.<br /><br />I dont actually know if thats whats happening but I think. Libertas you really know your shit so maybe you could enlighten us. I will copy and paste a selection of the messages but they are all the same shite.

				I wont add a list, I added it before the last post, Im not sure if copious amounts of gaanj and benzos positively affect the short term memory to a significant level but there is at least a correlation between the two which is the needed started point.
