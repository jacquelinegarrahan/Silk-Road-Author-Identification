				In every topic I go to there are at least 3 or 4 whole pages of spam threads.I I am not to the point of anger yet rather diappointment. So I decided to make a thread of ideas to stop or limit the spam accounts with as little obstruction as possible to the newbies sellers and buyers alike.

				Why can&#039;t the staff look into anti-spam mods? Or do they not work that well through TOR?<br /><br />I&#039;d be up for developing a mod this weekend in my spare time? The code would be openly released.. And in return I&#039;d like a salt shaker full of coke eh? Open gangnum style. Haha nah I&#039;d do it for free :).<br /><br />Looking at the spam from bkcoin or whatever the asshole&#039;s name is.. It seems to be posting the same message and over...<br /><br />So surely a simple solution would be: Check if the post is the same as a previous post in the last 24H and if so disallow it?

Even though I was told not to bother the spam I still deleted as much as possible. So the fact of this situation is there is 2 Spam Busters...&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=mlist;sa=search .<br /><br />So you can see there is not enough Spam Buster to deal with all the spam quickly enough to not have 70% of the members wading over spam threads. Further more of the 2 Spam Busters It is my belief that they are only in 2 time zones so this creates several gaps of time when they are not online to delete the Spam add that to these Spam Busters IRL Jobs and these guys are at full speed always trying to clean up the spam.<br /><br />As to why these has not to been taken care of you guess is as good as mine, but in the mean time either we deal with the situation or pull out the botnets to spam the spammer.<br /><br />X)<br /><br />nomad bloodbath

				This problem could addressed in an automated way by allowing accounts with fewer than 100 posts to only start 1 new thread per hour. The spammer could create lots of new accounts, but at least it would slow him down, and he would get tired of doing it more quickly. Last night he was left to his own devices for over 2 hours and filled every subforum with pages and pages of spam threads. I believe he only quit when he finally got bored or tired.

				It&#039;s kind of strange. I mean, I&#039;m sure this was some sort of browser failure, but yesterday I was told that a post I attempted after preview couldn&#039;t be made because I&#039;d &quot;posted less than 0 seconds ago&quot;. Yet spamhead can jerk off all over the forums apparently without restriction. It sucks to be that guy who says &quot;surely there&#039;s a tech fix&quot; but I mean, come on.

				Yeah, happens to me all the time trying to do searches.&nbsp; That one&#039;s 5 seconds.&nbsp; I assume it&#039;s something or other to do with all of our IP addresses appearing to the forum as &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; (the local loopback address, as in that&#039;s always the computer you&#039;re on).&nbsp; So it thinks all of us posted from the forum server&#039;s IP :)

				Can they not just select user delete forum account and delete/remove all posts, i know this is an option on php and would remove every thread they create in a second.

				GreenGiant, even if they could, someone with the power to do it has to be online. Right now there are 3 admins, 2 mods and 2 spam busters, and hours can go by before one of them logs on. In the mean time, the forums are rendered almost unusable from the pages of spam. If they don&#039;t want to delegate spam busting authority to more people, they should work on an automated solution.

				&nbsp;Also as has been mentioned earlier many times I don`t think anyone aould object to some captchas whether they are when you register for an account or when you post a new thread.I do feel bad for kind of calling out the mods I too wish DPR and inigo would formally&nbsp; address this problem of course I say this in the most respectful way We all know how much DPR already has on his plate right now. I am not sure what the policy is on enlisting spam busters to delete threads but I would be willing to volunteer to help in that process.

				The temporary solution is to avoid the forum from around 300 to 1000 UTC. That&#039;s when the least people are around and the spammer goes wild.
