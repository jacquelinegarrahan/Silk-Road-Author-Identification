				I have been to Ibiza, it is great fun, clubs and beaches. I would suggest going to Barcelona, butt also go to the Southern coast of Spain as it most beautiful and a great time as well.&nbsp; I dunno about sending drugs to your hotel. I would suggest going to barcelona first, go to la ramblas in barcelona and get drugs there it is very easy. then take a faerie or plane over to Ibiza.

				I&#039;ve had plenty of success in overnighting packages to hotels 3 days before I&#039;m gonna be there.&nbsp; Just make sure to call the hotel first and ask how they&#039;d like it addressed.&nbsp; I like to call once in the morning, and then again before I go to bed to get the info from two separate people.&nbsp; Generally you put the name on the first line along w/ your room number, and then &quot;C/O [insert hotel name]&quot; on the second line.&nbsp; Sometimes they&#039;ll ask you to include the dates you&#039;re staying on, or the C/O will be the person who does receiving at the hotel along w/ the hotel name.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;d suggest writing the name of whoever you&#039;re sending it to in HUGE letters everywhere on the package or coloring/marking it in an easily noticeable way.&nbsp; Might seem like it&#039;d raise a bit of suspicion when mailing, but it&#039;s common practice for people who mail a lot of stuff to hotels for their trips.&nbsp; Hotel mailrooms are a fucking MESS, and I&#039;ve had them say they don&#039;t see it before only to call me later saying they found it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never been to Ibiza, but if it&#039;s a nice hotel you&#039;re staying in it should be a breeze.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had an issue doing this, besides when they can&#039;t find the fucking package anywhere lol - although they always have.

				i have mailed to friends staying at hotels a half dozen times and never a worry - i think its a good idea to know <br />what room # they will be in. Hawaii England Florida never a problem yet.

				I wonder if saving one mailing by having your seller send it directly might be better than shipping to yourself and then there.<br /><br />Sounds like Hotels work out fine. If mailing yourself, you might add a large or heavy item to the package that would have been difficult to take on the airplane. Such things are often mailed ahead.<br /><br />When You are there (or beforehand online) you might look around for a house to rent or something like that if the hotel idea worries you. Groups renting a house can be great fun when the group is fun ;-)

				I have had many things not from SR delivered to hotels in the past. It&#039;s best to ask for a note to be made on your reservation, and to speak with someone (not a 1-800 reservations person) on staff, to ask how/who you should set up to make sure you get your deliveries.
