				I&#039;m still new to bitcoin transactions and am confused.<br /><br />It seems simple to purchase bitcoins with the cash deposit option using the money gram system at places like CVS. However, I am very concerned about the security of sending the bitcoins directly to my silk road account. <br /><br />If I send the bitcoins to an email address, how do I retrieve them and resend them from that address? Is this safer? I also don&#039;t understand how to use instawallet. I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m going to do something stupid and lose all of my bitcoins or get tracked by the authorities. <br /><br />If there are better ways to purchase bitcoins please share them with me (and explain clearly).

				You don&#039;t send coins to an email address, but rather a bitcoin address. You should have instawallet (https://www.instawallet.org) on your PC which is kept online. Back up the wallet URL in case something happens as it&#039;s the key to your wallet? Instead of sending coins directly to SR, make sure you give your instawallet bitcoin address to the cashier where your depositing your cash. Then enter your SR bitcoin address into your instawallet , where it says Send Payment

				Sigh....<br /><br />Where in the world did you read anything about an email address? You send bitcoins to a wallet. Instawallet.org is a website which provides throw-away wallets. Each time you go to instawallet.org a new address is generated for you to use and you can send bitcoins to that address.<br /><br />There are tons of posts about bitcoins and security, UTMFSE.

				On the bitinstant page I saw an option that said &quot;bitcoins to email&quot;, but if nobody is familiar with this method then I won&#039;t try it.<br /><br />I know about instawallet but I&#039;m not sure how to use it safely. Every time I access the site it gives me a different random bitcoin address and I see no options for downloading or anything. I see that I&#039;m supposed to copy the bitcoin address, but how would I access the wallet after transferring bit coins to it?<br /><br />And also, are people still getting asked for ID when using bitinstant because I&#039;m planning on using fake information and making an excuse about not having ID on me.

Basically there are sooo many wallets that finding one with coins in it would not be worth the time...<br /><br />That does NOT mean you should use it like a bank account or other type of wallet, generally people use it for temporary storage and transfer coins out short after deposit into the instawallet.&nbsp; &nbsp;You then go to the site again for a new one when needed.<br /><br />I was one of those posters, a few days ago instawallet seemed to have technical issues where the site and wallets weren&#039;t updating.&nbsp; Instawallet received the coins but their server didn&#039;t update the wallets.&nbsp; It was resolved in less then 24 hours and coins were in the wallets. Interesting note, I transferred my coins out of the wallet and they were NOT mixed, many people say instawallet does some mixing, but I was able to trace it with blockchain (1 record direct transer, no mixing at all).&nbsp; I would guess this also had to do with the technical issues.<br /><br />From other internet searches seems like something similar happened last month, but many people have used this service for a while... <br /><br />You get what you pay for, it&#039;s a free service.&nbsp; If you want something more reliable, maybe blockchain or bit coin fog is better for you.<br /><br />

Unless SR is completely compromised and somehow can track back coins in your account (SR mixes btc anyways).<br /><br />BTW you can change your SR bitcoin address when ever you want, just go to your orders page.
