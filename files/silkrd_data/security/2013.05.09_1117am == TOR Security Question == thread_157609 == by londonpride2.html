				It is fine to run SR over TOR in one browser whilst using another browser to access clear-net sites as per normal web browsing (at the same time). <br /><br />Or am I mistaken?

				It&#039;s technologically safe, ie TorBrowser isn&#039;t going to leak info to a clearnet browser on its own. However, the potential for human error increases. If you&#039;re accessing Google over Tor and type a search in but accidentally type it into the clearnet browser, you have leaked info. It could potentially deanonymize you.<br /><br />As always, your behavior is half of your protection, and there&#039;s nothing TorBrowser can do for you if you behave in unsafe ways.<br />

				Thanks for the question, londonpride2. Definitely not a dumb question! I&#039;m a &quot;technical&quot; guy and I&#039;m still trying to wrap my head around the whole TOR network.<br /><br />Another question along those lines ... how does this traffic look internally? I.E. on an internal firewall before it gets out in the wild ... from the PC running the TOR browser to the router.

				It is safe to run Tor browser and a clearnet browser at the same time. Just don&#039;t access the same page at the same time from the same computer. And don&#039;t do anything silly, like login to your Facebook page or your Gmail from Tor.

				I&#039;m told its technically safe as long as you don&#039;t do anything stupid.&nbsp; Just to be safe &amp; protect against my own possibly stupidities I never run both at once.

				I&#039;m not a fullon tech/spec person BUT to give you the &quot;tech talk&quot; functionality<br /><br />BUT - Why can&#039;t you wait to hear about your social network? offline in Tor<br /><br />Best practice in LOG OFF - Tor<br /><br />fwiw<br /><br />ce<br />

				There&#039;s no reason not to get off of Tor to check FB but from a technical standpoint I can&#039;t see much of a reason that doing this would give much away about your identity. The exit node to whatever server you&#039;re communicating with (FB) is the only place where traffic can be intercepted. So someone knows that I connected to FB using Tor, but that&#039;s about it.

I guess I was looking for a more detailed explanation of what kind of information I would be leaking to FB while on Tor. But, curiosity also killed the cat, maybe I should just play it safe and enjoy my comfy mask 8-)
