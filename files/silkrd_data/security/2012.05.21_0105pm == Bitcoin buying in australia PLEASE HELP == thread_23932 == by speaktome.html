				Nah mate, you&#039;ll get given a reference number, that and the deposit details are all you&#039;ll need to go in with!<br /><br />DON&#039;T, however much you want to, wear a balaclava... It looks a tiny bit suspect...

				Excellent advice....and also don&#039;t rub your nose a lot, or act nervous.&nbsp; The tellers think you have a gambling problem anyway, so you&#039;re golden.&nbsp; ;D

				Hi all, I&#039;m in the same boat as this fella.. I&#039;ve made a few purchases from the road but I bought my coin from Bitpiggy, which as you may or may not know recently went down.. I&#039;m rather nervous about making an actual cash deposit for bitcoins. I&#039;ve heard spendbitcoins.com is a reputable etc. site so I&#039;m gonna drop some of my next paycheck on some btc but I was wondering if anyone could clarify the process for me, just in case.. From what I know:<br /><br />1) Put in order for btc<br />2) Get a reference number, deposit details etc.<br />3) Go into bank, don&#039;t act suspicious, fill out the deposit form with aforementioned details and put the reference number on there somewhere (not exactly sure where, heh)<br />4) Go home and hope the cops don&#039;t knock my door down<br /><br />Sorry for being an annoying nub, and I hope this hasn&#039;t been answered a million times..

				That&#039;s exactly it! And remember, it&#039;s not illegal to BUY bitcoins, but it is illegal to have illicit substances sent to you in the mail!<br /><br />Play bad but play safe!

				I&#039;m also planning to make future deposits in random banks in random suburbs. I figure anything that&#039;s not a pattern must be good, right? ;)

				Just to put a different spin on this thread; How many employees do the big4 banks combined employ? I think it&#039;s a reasonable assumption that some bank employees use SR, how do they get their coins? Obviously not thru their own bank... although...
