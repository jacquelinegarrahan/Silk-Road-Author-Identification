				<br />Am I just beign peranoid - first my transfer of BTC from instawallet to btcfog was interrupted by a 504 error &#039;gateway timeout&#039;. Fortunately the coins made it - but I thought the error was odd. Secondly, I cannot seem to login to cyptoxchange - I&#039;m getting a server side error. Is it me or should I be concerned?<br />

				It&#039;s instawallet.&nbsp; I did a couple tiny transfers today, just to check it out.&nbsp; The original owner is giving them up and somebody else is taking over, but they seem not near as reliable, and probably on a way smaller server than they used to be.&nbsp; I loved instawallet, and it was all I used, and I&#039;ve have gladly paid a small price to continue using them, as they were much faster than having a wallet on my computer, and much safer, IMO.<br /><br />But if you google around, you&#039;ll see that the original owner has said to get your money out.&nbsp; The two sums I transferred today, also went thru, but they also came up with the error message you mentioned...I&#039;m in the process of finding something else.&nbsp; What I&#039;ve seen so far hasn&#039;t made me a fan of btc fog yet...might change if I can&#039;t find something, but I&quot;m ok outside of TOR...it&#039;s not illegal to move btc around.

Their backend is receiving too many fetch requests. Instawallet will always be the best BTC shuffler around, regardless of its new owners.

				Yep: in spite of the 504 errors, and some &#039;slowdowns&#039; instawallet still delivers and is just so damn handy, if you like to keep all your stuff in the cloud....it&#039;s a good tool, and I hope it continues on, new owners and all...I always thought if he&#039;d just plugged in a real small cutout to make sure he get a little percentage, most of us would have been fine with that, or even an easier setup to donate to the guy...but anyway, still going on....
