				I noticed something fucking weird as well. I got an extra $100. I was like, &quot;Wow, tony76 came back and returned my money&quot;. But I changed the settings to bitcoin view, and I still have the same amount of bitcoins. So it looks like I have more money but I still have the same amount of bitcoins.

				Well i just placed an order, if it is hedged and i cancel it does that mean Ill receive the same amount of bitcoins? or will i receive the amount of bitcoins the rate is currently at? <br /><br />I think the orders will bounce because when the vendor tries to cash in the order he&#039;ll be receiving half the expected amount right?

				Yes, I noticed this too....yesterday for about 25 minutes, a HUGE increase in BTC value! All orders looked 1/2 price, couldn&#039;t believe my good fortune......but about 20-25 minutes after it happened, everything went back to normal. There has been some weirdness going on!

				My advice, If you have a reasonable figure of cash to play with, Invest in bitcoins.<br />The Silkroad is only becoming more viral every day.<br /><br />Increased demand = Value of Bitcoins go up.<br />Could easily double your money if you were good with this sort of thing.
