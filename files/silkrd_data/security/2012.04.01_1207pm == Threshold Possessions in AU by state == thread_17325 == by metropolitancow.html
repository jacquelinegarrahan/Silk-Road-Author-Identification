				NSW 0.75g threshold for MDMA is derisory and out of touch with the risk and the product itself.<br /><br />Essentially its sending the message that its safer legally to possess, use and deal Heroin.&nbsp; tut tut.

The relevant weight is now the weight of the whole mixture, including substances other than the drug. This table shows the traffickable quantities of common drugs (from the legislation):<br /><br />(http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/thumbs/f86c1561b8e35762d11e72eda15abd8e.png) (http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=f86c1561b8e35762d11e72eda15abd8e.png)<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure, but I&#039;m assuming the 0.75 &#039;small&#039; amount - anything under this won&#039;t result in any sort of conviction?&nbsp; i.e. they have some no-conviction-drug-diversion program thing to stop small users having their lives ruined by a drug conviction.<br /><br />The 3g does not automatically mean you get a conviction for trafficking - it means a prima facie case so that the burden of proof shifts to you to show that you had no intention to traffic.
