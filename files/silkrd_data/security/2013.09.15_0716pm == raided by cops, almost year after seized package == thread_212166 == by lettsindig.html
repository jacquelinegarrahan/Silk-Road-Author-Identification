				hey:)<br /><br />just thought I&#039;d put it out there incase someone has use for this info..<br /><br />this is regarding a &quot;house search&quot; / &quot;police raid&quot; that happened in Scandinavia some time this year, in a small pretty drug-free suburb.<br /><br /><br />early in the morning the house owner had opened the door and the police was there with a warrant, while still asleep and before being able to act the police was in my room.<br />they said that a small amount of hard-drugs (like 1 gram, maybe best if I don&#039;t mention the type..) addressed to me was stopped by customs,&nbsp; and they kept repeating the question asking me there the drug paraphernalia/user-equipment was,&nbsp; and said that I might aswell cooperate and tell them where the rest was cos the dog would find it anyway and I would be let off easier with cooperation, and that they would take me in to get a urin or blood test and all..<br /><br />Now the drugs seized by customs, I actually had a little of the same including user-equipment and it was very nearby (arms reach),&nbsp; but luckily I kept lying and didn&#039;t tell them about it as it was pretty well hidden. <br />Like a decade ago I was raided too, and then aswell they didn&#039;t find certain things even when it wasnt all that well-hidden, just was in less-obvious places and out of reach of the dog..<br />this time it was hidden high up, and I felt sooo happy after the dog-handler asked one of the policemen who shortly before had searched ontop of lockers etc. and probably had his hands centimeters from the stuff, if the &quot;high areas had been cleared&quot; and he said &quot;yes&quot;.. i was laughing inside I was so happy about that, because I lied to them in the small (maybe stupid) hope that they wouldn&#039;t find it.. lulz. They would indeed have found it if they weren&#039;t sloppy though, but luckily and unusually, these policefolks were very friendly and seemed like nice people, and I think they believed my lies (guess I can act well=P)<br /><br />Anyway I knew I was in shit cos I stupidly had some other drug-related stuff nearby, that I despite other ppls warnings of having that while fearing a raid, didnt listen to and still had around..&nbsp; while the pigs were scouring around I thought it was kinda obvious and unavoidable and was just preparing to put my hands behind my back to be cuffed for it .. :/<br />I feared being contacted by cops or even raided because I had several mysteriously missing packages from top vendors who said they were sure they sent it.&nbsp; Looking back at this, I will be sure to pay back a 50% refund I got from one vendor for this, as most likely they did indeed send it after all as it turns out..<br /><br />anyway, I pointed them to the most easily-discoverable stashes of weed/hash I had closely nearby that I knew them/dog would find anyway, and waited until theyd find this other thing....&nbsp; surely they did, and I was arrested and locked up rest of the day, interrogated by some grumpy manly woman who seemed hesitant to explain my rights and be friendly, after I said I didn&#039;t know what alot of it even meant, or what I could say or had right to.. and they dumped me in the middle of nowhere,hours frmo home..luckily contacted family who helped me and saved me frmo walking whole night++ to get back......<br /><br /><br /><br />anyway nuff bout the details, uh,&nbsp; my point really and what may be interesting to some altho maybe just unusual for this case or place,&nbsp; &nbsp;is that what they came for was drugs that had been stopped last year.. it was almost a year earlier that customs had stopped it,&nbsp; but they didn&#039;t come before now..&nbsp; stupidly I don&#039;t know the laws very well but I guess the nearly a year old warrant signed by a judge was also valid after all this time but I failed to verify such things at the time...<br /><br /><br />I had some luck in all this tho,&nbsp; the other drug-related case I dont wanna elaborate much on kindof took their attention I think.&nbsp; Because that turned out to be a case on its own, and was interrogated seperately for.&nbsp; They never took urin or blood samples of me, and while he had dug up my phone before we left,&nbsp; it was still on the table when I got home,&nbsp; so was my computer..&nbsp; so I guess this other case took all their attention and after that they didnt bother as much with this lil drug-in-the-mail case anymore, failed to test me and take the electronic equipment.&nbsp; Maybe Id test positive but had none on phone/comp to worry bout neway tho..<br /><br />and luckily, as they just barely missed my drugs because I for some unusual reason had decided to spend the extra 30 second hiding it a bit better than normal the day before,&nbsp; I could use heavily the days after I was arrested, getting rid of the remaining evidence while comfortiing myself with some good time despite all the shit=P<br /><br /><br />now Im kinda poor and have some issues so I prolly wont be able to pay their likely massive fine, unless Im forced to goto jail anyway but Im trying to see the positive in it I guess...my friends (&quot;friends&quot; - dealers I mean) have been in prison before and basically just said it was boring jsut watched tv and played cards there all day while meeting many new drug-contacts.. <br />also now that Im a convicted felon, they even took my fingerprints and dna that I couldnt refuse, I am banned frmo any decent jobs etc. and prolly wont be allowed entry into many countries, and considered a &quot;criminal&quot; and &quot;badbuy&quot; like murderers and rapists,&nbsp; so I guess another one or hundred drug cases wont be a problem for me anymore, besides the fines likely resulting in prison anyway.. thatd suck,&nbsp; but officially im grouped with lots of other crazies and a convicted felon now and prolly wont have to be as afraid of cops anymore as I have already crossed that threshold and been busted in a somewhat serious case,&nbsp; no way back and have a stained criminal record forever... :S<br /><br /><br />I had a very good experience this time with the cops though,&nbsp; which is unusual.. Ive been busted for small amounts buying on the streets&nbsp; n suchbuncha times in the past in different ways,&nbsp; and often the police would humiliate me infront of others, neighbors etc., make fun of me and generally trying to provoke me , I assume they hope I will snap and attack them or something lol, unless theyre just jerks and not very people-friendly in general..&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these cops (most of them atleast) were very friendly and understanding, made sure not to hurt me and be gentle with the cuffs and all, didnt make it too obvious to the whole neighborhood and such, which made it all alot easier.<br />I am always friendly, never hurt anyone and while I surely deny certain accusations when I know they can&#039;t proove it,&nbsp; I always try act as their friend and is nice even when they are trying to provoke me and such and make sure to let them know theyre in control (like ask them before moving,&nbsp; or letting them know in advance if there is something like a knife nearby or anything... ).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The state just paid the salary of almost 10 police officers who played different roles in this whole event that took most of the day,&nbsp; just to arrest little me who never hurt anyone and just wanted to be left alone with my occasional drug experiementation....&nbsp; and soon they will likely pay for my stay in their cage for a month or few with these crazy sentences. it cost more money than I have ever had myself at once! lol.. crazy..&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />also !&nbsp; &nbsp; I have used several addresses, and another addressee responsible for another address recently told me he got a letter from police,&nbsp; it said that they had found drugs and&nbsp; but that they had dismissed the case because they were lacking investigation-resources but that investigation may be re-opened if new evidence comes to light.&nbsp; I am pretty sure because he lives in a crime-ridden part of the main city here, so the cops simply didnt bother with his case... but in my case, in suburban place with little crime they met up with their whole armed squad and everything instead,&nbsp; altho it took them almost a year to get here...<br /><br /><br />eh, this got a bit much possibly much details for many to bother... just thought Id put it out there.<br /><br /><br />So, if you have been missing packages that you believe the vendor really did send....&nbsp; &nbsp;do not stop being careful and stop expecting a raid just because many months have passed...&nbsp; &nbsp;I dont know why I assume lacking resources,&nbsp; &nbsp;but here as said they took almost a year before they showed up.<br /><br /><br />last thing...&nbsp; I denied any knowledge of drugs in the mail,&nbsp; but I admitted to the case where they found stuff in my room. <br />Im pretty sure they wont be able to prove anything and case will be dismissed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was just stupid for having other things in the house at the time,&nbsp; altho luckily thanks to that I think they kinda over-looked the first reason they came there for.&nbsp; I guess if I had tested positive in urin/blood test for the drug that came in mail,&nbsp; I would probably be sentenced for it,&nbsp; cos as I have found it.. its not true what they say &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;,&nbsp; you are &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;,&nbsp; and the ones with lots of money are much more likely to get off or atleast much easier, and if something seems somewhat likely... thats what the court will believe,&nbsp; even if its not true&nbsp; (trust me I got charged in a bad case like that many years ago..&nbsp; I didnt do anything but it seemed somewhat likely, so I got charged with it, innocently.&nbsp; but course noone believes that........).<br /><br /><br /><br />stay safe, take care..&nbsp; be careful, and hide everything as good as you can cos thers a small chance that even in a raid they wont find it.&nbsp; &nbsp;be very wary of missing packages if you trust the vendor!<br /><br /><br />l8rs ;)<br />

				The good news is scandanavian jails are a joke where you kind of report there on the weekend and after work usually for petty drug crimes, dunno about importing though. You can also take free school in jail (do it.. take programming so you can work remotely where nobody will know you have a criminal record) and get to collect welfare when you get out lol. <br /><br />Since you were interrogated for something else I would imagine they found that old warrant lying around they never acted on and decided to go after you since it was a slow day in Finland/Norway wherever you live. <br /><br />You also should&#039;ve immediately asked for a lawyer, even if it was just to plead guilty at least you wouldn&#039;t have talked to them at all. Also the bullshit drop in the middle of nowhere is done by cops in every country, I was once dumped after a night in the drunk tank about a 5hr walk from where I lived on the side of a highway.

However I recently read an article describing such prison systems and apparently they have the lowest&nbsp; recidivism rates in the world, largely because they accept that, whatever they have done, most prisoners will eventually released into society, and so the focus is on teaching them useful skills and allowing them certain levels of autonomy, such as cooking their own meals, to prepare them to reenter society. And this was not an open prison for tax evaders and fraudsters. This was murdererers and other violent offenders.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So maybe the jokes on us, with our brutalising criminal finishing schools, where many prisoners come out with skag habits they didn&#039;t go in with, and few skills other than hammering pallets together. A recent British report spoke of three to a cell overcrowding in cells designed for one. Its a far cry from the Daily Mails &quot;sky TV and play stations for prisoners.&quot;

				I remember one time when police raided my house looking for illegal drugs;<br />they broke down some walls with a hammer, they took down the acoustic ceiling and teared every pack of spaghetti from the kitchen on the floor to look if drugs were hidden there. The only thing they didn&#039;t find was a bong just sitting behind the sofa lol... And it was only illegal thing in the house eventually

				&nbsp;Let me tell SR a bedtime story,<br /><br />Awhile back I had a friend&#039;s house raided twice in a very short time span. He is middle-aged but a &quot;man child&quot; if you will and looks, dresses, and usually acts much younger than he is. He used to drive around like an asshole around his small city/town, with no worry about traffic violations or even being pulled over while over the limit BAC-wise. He used to say things like &quot;cops around here totally leave me alone, they don&#039;t seem to think much of me, just that I&#039;m an idiot.&quot; <br /><br />Well, those statement he made to me seemed quite minimizing of the danger of making yourself known to LE as a reckless waste-oid. So... sometime passes and during this time this buddy basically turned his big three story house in a free-for-all (literally free rent/drugs) for a group of sketchy &quot;kids&quot; mostly that he would party with and be involved with small time to maybe mid-level drug dealing of several things (I think mostly cannabis, but coke, pills and even dope was around regularly I guess). Pretty damn grimey scene. Well, this buddy was flipping a really very little amount of stuff for profit (by any of one the LEO standards&#039;), but also providing a veritable cornucopia of drugs like an all you can eat buffet to the lingering drug friends squatting at his place. To explain further: he is very wealthy due to family money some inherited land, bonds, and and old money type from relatives in the oil business. He has apparently spent multiple million just on drugs in the past two years. Seen him drop 20K at a time like you or I take a piss. No kidding. <br /><br />And just for clarification this is in a pretty rural area in one of the smallest and (by some statistics) one of most crime free states in the U.S.<br />So, comes to find out the locals weren&#039;t leaving him alone out of the kindness of their hearts... they were planning something. The HIDTA task force in the area (federal cooperation, but mostly state/local enforcement) raided his &quot;drug den&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;My buddy (and the LEO target) wasn&#039;t even home at the time. LOL. It was apparently after a party and there was almost nothing to be found except legal firearms, and maybe a tiny bit of cannabis and pot pipes. The LEO were def surprised, and def embarrassed. Supreme waste of time and our tax dollars. Great effort though from the Super Cops! <br /><br />But that wasn&#039;t the end of it. The Feds were apparently trying to build a case based on the guns being around, and obvious drug activity. So a few months later, the FBI and ATF raid the same house again. Full SWAT team with assault rifles, shotguns, other weapons, vests, and tactical equipment like night/thermal vision that no state cops could ever get their hands on. This was no joke, these guys don&#039;t fuck around. And just for clarification this is in a pretty rural area in one of the smaller and (by some statistics) one of most crime free states in the U.S.<br /><br />But, it gets better... This time the house was cleaned up a bit (contraband-wise) with just a few lingering drug fiends in the pad. The feds first started to surround the wrong neighbors&#039; house, c&#039;mon really? The feds used a battering ram on the wrong door, and blew their element of surprise by not being able to figure out the best point of entry. Which was a back door up quite a few stairs. Even the dip shit state/locals got that right at least. Kinda pathetic, and also very scary, that these Rambo wannabes with guns aren&#039;t that swift about carrying out lethal force tactics, something they do like everyday. At least they didn&#039;t shoot anyone&#039;s dog, they seem to love the chance to shoot anything they can get away with. <br /><br />So the search commences... and yet again both the FBI and ATF can&#039;t find ANY drugs or guns in the house, (I think all his guns were either impounded during the first raid, moved, or sold legally after the first raid) so that must have made them feel stupid for sure. And in almost poetic justice there was no contraband to be found anywhere other than I think a few minors consuming/possessing alcohol and just pot pipes, again. LOLZ. They apparently stood around barking intimidating bullshit at the people in the house, until one Fed spotted an aspirin or ibuprofen on the ground in the living room and excitedly starting saying &quot;oh look what we have here.. a Percocet&quot; (or something). Then one guy chimed in saying something to the effect of: &quot;look around at this house and who lives here. We had a huge party last night [it was some holiday] that&#039;s not illegal drugs, and do you really think that would of lasted on the floor all night with these kinds of people here.&quot; <br /><br />I guess that pretty much stopped the raid right in it&#039;s tracks, they must of been feeling real, real stupid. I love it. I just love that. LOL.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d share that for a laugh. Still don&#039;t over/underestimate their stupidity and/or rampant wild assumptions of like a Pablo Escobar type hiding out in &quot;their&quot; small west bumfuck town, and they&#039;re gonna be the hero cop to get &quot;the big fish.&quot; Fucking surreal though, and if I was this guy the Feds obviously want bad. I&#039;d be taking a long, long vacay to Belize or somewhere and sit on a beach all dau doing my drugs in peace and the protection of paid mercenaries and the crooked police in a place so corrupt and baller for an OG.

				A good reason to use fake ID boxes. If you have missing packs you can drop the box, then when they check up on it a year later it is registered to someone else and you are long gone.

				You played it smart. I did the same thing once and it saved me 30 years. Gave up some minor stuff that I knew they would find anyways and wouldn&#039;t get me any time while I kept quiet about the very big stuff right next to them. After some searching they just went with what I gave them. The best places to hide are the ones right in their fucking face. The first places they go are through furniture and in the ceilings but stuff that is right in front of their fucking face they don&#039;t even think about it.

				Im kind of curious... OP you said you got a felony out of all of that, but was the felony due to drugs, or other stuff - and if it was due to drugs, was it drugs that were not from the silk road?
