				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13160.45 is what made me decide to make this largely pointless although fun thread.<br /><br />Let&#039;s pretend that there is a scenario where there is a ciphertext protecting the content of communications between a vendor and a customer. The customer claims that the vendor sent them the following message &quot;You are a dumb stupid ass&quot;. The vendor says they never said such a thing. My job is to determine who is lying, but I can&#039;t see the content of the message because it is encrypted with GPG. Let&#039;s simulate that. Encrypt a message to your public GPG key, and post the ciphertext here. This simulates me having access to the ciphertext block of the alleged mean comment (which I would have if I had access to the SR database). We will pretend that this is the ciphertext block that you claim the mean vendor sent to you. Now I will ask you to tell me what the mean vendor said to you by pasting exactly what the ciphertext block decrypted into. Try to trick me into thinking the vendor said something they didn&#039;t say, or be honest by pasting exactly what the vendor said. Make sure to paste *exactly* what the message decrypted into without making any changes to the resulting plaintext.<br /><br />I will then use my super leet skills to help me determine if I trust your version of events or not. Feel free to tell me many messages, with one of them being what you really encrypted to your public key and all of the others being lies. Please paste plaintext in <div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code"> </code> blocks.<br /><br />example:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">You are a stupid fat meany!</code><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">You are the most awesome person ever!</code><br />if you already know how I am going to go about this feel free to say....<br />otherwise let me prove my claim :)<br /><br />also post your public key btw

				Blugh nobody wanted to play the game :(. So I will simply explain.<br /><br />If I have the following cipher text:<br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />hQEMAwRh9rcEwAqAAQf7BgY44mNJkmAyQZH6C52eCWP6PA7iC4cXM6ArH0hM974/<br />iwuBk5D/xmdj7C8R6HwR3MeNgdOKFmPN8ctuImkXdgSWUqKqf6X/JPGjtr5I6+JB<br />lSzJrVNydGmQJ62gL8YZHR9spS/iLpXu4lrx6h1ZYOpdpZRWlGDFeMtEwW6zaK7o<br />03Cu00wx//ETDwGRZlrM8uSopSv+yy2LWGFpiKLnvSaHkUKIOi3DStPTHVfpVkL/<br />WoyvKQW2xC8a16kbrpr3buhzOlnhzrV/lXUULIPI2/SACa20DhJpQsTwXynrznY3<br />PLO2L5OOAZmP+yNu3SuKxXzuD7iqTqN3t5uu90vwZNJKAf39QBMn/NvT6alQjrTT<br />rwipvq75UgpR3xL0ptmhUi/cgtD3CeiwESe2kgqhmDxJWpx74ymOkzSrm4LsT5ZL<br />H2Z783xIxZZ1A6E=<br />=1bIX<br />-----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br /><br />which is sent from Alice to Bob, and Bob says the message decrypts into &quot;kmf is a stupid fuck&quot; when I ask him what the message is (Alice of course claims that it decrypts into &quot;kmfw is awesome&quot;), I can quickly prove that Bob is lying because the size of the ciphertext is 479 bytes (as it would be if the plaintext was &quot;kmfw is awesome&quot;) and the ciphertext of &quot;kmf is a stupid fuck&quot; would have been 486 bytes. Of course I also need to know Bobs public key parameters. Also the message could very well have been &quot;kmf is a fool!&quot; ... but it certainly could not be &quot;kmf is a stupid fuck&quot;<br /><br />The moral of the story is that GPG ciphertexts don&#039;t disguise the size of GPG plaintexts. <br /><br />This could be very bad if you made an encryption system that only encrypts objects from a set. Even though an attacker can not break the encryption algorithm, they can still figure out what is going on.<br /><br />This is also the theory behind website fingerprinting attacks. An attacker could run an exit node and make a list of all of the websites accessed with it over a certain period of time. Then they could spider the websites visited. Then they could see the size of every page of a given website and the size of every page linked to off of that page. Then they could determine the size of every page linked to off of every page linked to from that page, etc. Now they can measure encrypted stream size at the entry node as their target surfs. Then they can use the process of elimination to determine the sites that the target is not visiting, and make a pretty good guess as to the site they are visiting (since the pattern will match and show that the target is potentially visiting that site, but certainly not visiting any of the sites for which their traffic pattern could not match). <br /><br />tl:dr : given a ciphertext encrypted to a known key, you can determine what the ciphertext will NOT decrypt into, and what it COULD decrypt into...but without breaking the encryption algorithm you can not determine what the ciphertext WILL decrypt into.

				Tor does a better job than most systems at trying to counter traffic classification, but it still isn&#039;t perfect. Even without using hidden markov models Tor traffic has been fingerprinted with over 50% accuracy. <br /><br />http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/flaws-spotlighted-in-tor-anonymity-network/<br /><br />The accuracy would almost certainly be significantly higher if they took markov modeling into consideration. <br /><br />In general, if your entry node is pwnt you are pretty much pwnt. A lot of people are paranoid about the exit node but I am far more worried about the entry node. <br /><br />You can take measures to protect against this sort of attack by adding chaffing to your circuit yourself. For example, if you load a lot of pages over the same circuit the fingerprint of any given page will be lost to the combination. However this muddying of fingerprints will not be present for hidden services because they use dedicated circuits. <br /><br />Still Tor does a much better job at countering this sort of attack than pretty much any encrypted VPN or proxy does. Encrypted VPN/SSL traffic can be classified with 90-99% certainty using even less sophisticated classifiers than this one. Throw in hidden markov modeling and the accuracy against VPN proxy and Tor alike is probably going to approach 100% if the target is viewing any substantially complex website or series of interlinked websites. Of course with out actually being able to decrypt the traffic you can not certainly prove what it is via traffic classification, but you can say that out of the ten million sites you have references for, the traffic Alice is getting has a 99% chance of coming from website number 374,982 in your database. <br /><br />Tor devs would argue that traffic classifiers are not as worrying as they are made to sound, because nobody has a big enough reference of fingerprints (after all, even if you have fingerprint for ten million websites, your dataset doesn&#039;t take another set of ten million other websites into consideration. So the accuracy figure is limited to the size of your reference database). Other people say that just making&nbsp; fingerprint references for all active hidden services (and it isn&#039;t impossible for an attacker to get such a list with a little work) plus all websites loaded through four or five malicious exit nodes is going to be enough. After all, there are a certain number of websites that most Tor users are loading, so if you have reference database for the top million some people would argue that it isn&#039;t that big of a deal that you don&#039;t have references for the bottom ten million. <br /><br />For a while people wanted ISPs to use traffic classifiers to try and detect people using encryption to download child porn. I don&#039;t think much came of it. I used to have the technical specs for an ISP level traffic classification system intended to detect people who loaded CP sites through encrypted tunnels...let me see if I can dig it up again.

				Interesting. That article is from 2010 though - surely there have been enough different forms of ghosting integrated into Tor since then to overcome those seemingly-basic issues? <br /><br />I ask because I don&#039;t know. A lot of this is beyond what I know about but it sounds like you could piece together even a simple .bat file to get around these issues? Or that Vidalia&#039;s feature of changing your identity every ten minutes would all but make it irrelevant? <br /><br />Also, how would your entry node end up compromised? <br /><br />Interested to see that page of stats you were gonna go hunt down :)

Hackers could also pwn entry guards that are added by legit people though. Also you need to worry about your ISP doing these attacks, they can see all of your traffic flows regardless of the entry guard used and regardless of if it is malicious or not. <br /><br />The main techniques for getting around this sort of attack are morphing, padding, cover traffic. Morphing tries to make one traffic flow look like another, for example a website might try to mimic googles traffic fingerprint. Padding adds dummy traffic that distorts or removes the fingerprint depending on how it is implemented (morphing usually makes use of padding). Cover traffic is pretty much another implementation of padding that pads the entire flow (Tor currently pads packets but not flows...all Tor packets have 512 byte payloads via padding, but Tor doesn&#039;t add entirely dummy packets to pad the stream). Splitting is another technique that can hide fingerprints. So can multiplexing. Tor does use multiplexing and it helps against traffic classifiers, its why loading multiple pages simultaneously over the same circuit makes it harder to pick a fingerprint out.

				So if I understand correctly, it is actually BENEFICIAL to your session security to load clearnet sites through tor while you&#039;re on SR or doing whatever else?

				Well for hidden services it doesn&#039;t help to load multiple sites at once because you use a dedicated circuit for hidden service connections. For clearnet it helps to load multiple things at once via the same circuit, because it significantly distorts the fingerprint of any given thing that you are loading.

				Get Tor to take anonymity more seriously than latency and/or implement a network that defends from these things. I guess you could have PHP scripts that add random padding to loaded pages to try to obscure their fingerprint, and add [padding][/padding] tags to the forum that drop what is in the padding.

Its very helpful reading these forums and want to learn as much as I can. of course i&quot;m using tor, but my provider is the evil &quot;Comcast&quot; I wonder how vulnerable I have left myself?

				Honestly Tor so far seems to be fine by itself. The people who are attacking it and pwning it are really really smart people who generally have lots of formal and informal education. But then they throw the whitepapers out there, and it is a lot easier to implement an attack from a whitepaper than it is to come up with it on your own. Also Tor generally tries to make attacks against it harder when they are discovered, but often times they are putting a bandaid over a deep wound. <br /><br />Yes Tor is weak to a lot of technical attacks, yes hidden services can be traced pretty damn easily (especially by an attacker who can order passive surveillance at specific points), no Tor will not keep you anonymous for very long from an attacker with a bit of money and know how, and there are a million and one ways that it can be attacked and pwnt.<br /><br />No, nobody except for academic researchers (and signals intelligence agencies, but they don&#039;t apparently act on the intelligence gathered, or particularly give a tenth of a shit about even highly criminal Tor users) have apparently done any attacks against Tor that resulted in hidden services being traced or clients deanonymized (although LE have hacked hidden services to trace them they never pwnt Tor directly so far), yes Tor is the best (implemented) system for low latency anonymity, no Tor can not even begin to compare to the anonymity that could be offered by high latency solutions, no there are not any cutting edge high latency systems that have been implemented, the majority of this sort of shit never leaves the whitepaper or research lab (attacks and defenses) (except for prob by intelligence agencies, and no they don&#039;t give a shit about you) (even though you should never assume that attackers interested in you are too stupid to do interesting things) and nobody knows anyone who was busted via Tor being pwnt (and there are case studies that show people who used Tor getting away from the FBI and Interpol even with significant international resources focused on tracing them). <br /><br />That pretty much sums it up as one big huge run on sentence. If you take away &quot;Tor is secure!&quot; from this or &quot;Tor is insecure!&quot; from this will largely depend on your outlook on things / personality type ;) (and perhaps who you think is after you....secure from who/what is a much better question after all...)

				Meh that wikipedia article is actually seriously lacking. They don&#039;t put enough emphasis on *The node shuffles the message order* which as far as I am concerned is a requirement for a network to be considered a mix network.

				What problems do you see in Tor users running their own bridge (on another network) and configuring Tor to connect to that bridge?&nbsp; That way the first hop in the Tor network is a known relay/bridge.&nbsp; The only problem I can see is the user&#039;s bridge getting hacked by an attacker.&nbsp;
