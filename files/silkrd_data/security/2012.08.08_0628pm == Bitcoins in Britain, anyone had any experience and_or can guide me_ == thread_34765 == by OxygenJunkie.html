				Hi guys, basically what the title says. I know there are guides on here but a lot of them are American specific. If anyone can help me with information on how to get bit coins from cold, hard earned Great British pounds into internet monies I would be ever so grateful!<br />

				Likewise! I&#039;ve never used Silk Road before and the Bitcoin system, although obviously necessary, seems like such a headache. Now I just need to learn how to actually order :P Roughly speaking, how many bitcoins would I expect for 60 squid?

For instance at the moment one BTC is worth just over GBP 7.22. If you send GBP 60 you&#039;ll receive GBP 52.50 worth of Bitcoins including my commission which at today&#039;s rates would be just over BTC 7.2714. It&#039;s important to emphasise that many vendors use the option available to them on SR to link their prices to the USD/Bitcoin exchange rate so if the Bitcoin does rise in value, the overall price of items in BTC will actually go down, does that make sense?<br /><br />V.

				Yeah that makes sense :) I do have a couple of questions with regards to ordering from the marketplace. Once I have bitcoins in my account, have selected my order and entered my address, how do things go from there? I understand the use of PGP is involved, excuse my ignorance but what exactly is PGP and in what part of the ordering process does this come up?

				Mt gox is easier than you might think although it looks daunting - get validated after signing up by scanning and uploading your ID to them and then they send you onto their partner company who have a Barkleys account in the UK, after you validate with them (this shoud take no more than a day if doen properly) you can get in touch with your bank to get tham to send money to them - once it is set up it is easy as pie.<br /><br />If you do decide to do it and come across any problems or have questions get in touch and i will be in touch quickly as I am on holiday at the moment.&nbsp; I thought it was really difficult at first but as long as you read the FAQs and go through the stages there is really nothing to it.

				Sorry about the wrong info.<br /><br />Vlad, I don&#039;t see the point in buying bitcoins other than for illicit purposes but you have more experience with them so maybe there are other reasons one might use them for legal purchases.<br /><br />Speaking from my experience between mtgox and yourself.&nbsp; I had my bitcoins 24 hours after starting the mtgox process (now that it is set up it takes a matter of a couple/few hours) - it is impersonal but I just want my coins not a friend.<br /><br />I found you to be polite to deal with but speaking for myself I found you to be in no rush to send me the details needed to send the cash - I was still waiting to get all of the details five days after contacting you - which was when I told you I would go elsewhere.&nbsp; I was not told upfront that your fee was 10% which Is fair enough I suppose since you are doing a service and you are not mtgox who can charge less with more customers - just too expensive for me).&nbsp; <br /><br />I am sure you are usually quicker dealing with people but it would be imossible to be able to match mt gox for speed - and speed, for me, is the name of the game since you then need to get the goods from the vendor.<br />Also, where you come out better is that mtgox minimum is a $100 transfer.<br /><br />This is not a dig at your service, I think people should have all of the facts.<br /><br />p.s. it is not illegal to buy bitcoins <br /><br />
