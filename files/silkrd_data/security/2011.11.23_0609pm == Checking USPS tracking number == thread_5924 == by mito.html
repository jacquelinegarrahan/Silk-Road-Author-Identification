				We shouldn&#039;t use Tor to check tracking numbers in USPS because that could raise a flag with site admins.&nbsp; That I understand.<br /><br />But what if you check the tracking number 50 times a day, through regular&nbsp; Internet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Could that raise a flag too?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :P <br /><br />

				Don&#039;t quote me on this but I&#039;ve read before that LEO used tracking numbers to link people / things together to make arrests.&nbsp; This was for UPS but I think it&#039;s best if we assume it&#039;s the same for USPS too. Also I believe this person was already under surveillance.

Think about all the people waiting for checks in the mail from all kinds places (work, government, 401k payouts, etc) ... they desperately need the money so obsessively check the tracking as they wait ...<br /><br />Money is just one example. I bet there&#039;s lots of other stuff people freak out about while they&#039;re waiting for the mail to arrive besides contraband and compulsively punch in the tracking number desperately hoping for the smallest update on the whereabouts of whatever they&#039;re waiting for!

				There&#039;s kids all over where I&#039;m from who check their tracking number everyday to see if their package is updated and how closer it is to them at that specific moment. I don&#039;t think its necessary to check a tracking number 50 times a day to see where your package is. IMO.

				It&#039;s not checking your tracking number multiple times aday you need to worry about...<br /><br />It&#039;s the IP that shows up when you check your tracking number.<br /><br />The cops already know your tracking number if it&#039;s the cops sending you the package, they have no need to identify tracking numbers that are being checked hundreds of times. Even when I ordered legal stuff I checked it like 50 times an hour because I was an impatient kid, long before I found out about the SR.<br /><br />If you check the tracking number from your house, they can possibly use it as evidence because the only way you could get the tracking number is through the SR.<br /><br />What one vendor suggested to me was, check the tracking number from a public wifi spot(don&#039;t get caught on camera doing this), and even for added security, use a MAC address spoofer so it doesn&#039;t seem to come from your computer. This way you can say, anyone in the area was using the address to order drugs, all they really have is McDonalds public IP Checking the tracking number.<br /><br />If you check it with tor, it could show up as an out of state IP checking it, flagging it... but then again, I just recently got a new ISP, and when I try to track my normal IP, it says I am in Texas... when I am not even anywhere near that state.
