				Sorry, had to regurgitate the subject line but there is something that I think all buyers should know.<br /><br />We vendors do not save your address and SR removes it once the package is marked as confirmed/shipped. HOWEVER, we do maintain the DNC&#039;s until you finalize showing your received the package. We have to, it is our proof that we shipped it and proof that you received it.<br /><br />Now, I have several people who received their package almost a week ago and have not finalized the escrow. I have to hold on to the DCN&#039;s, that means there is a risk until you finalize. I may not have your address but that DCN is proof of a sale and can be tracked!<br /><br />Please, when you receive your package, finalize the deal. That way we can shred the one link that remains and is traceable to you!<br /><br />

				Thank you.....<br /><br />I&#039;m a vendor as well. First of all, I respect buyers and the fact that they want to use pgp, but SR takes care of encryption/cryptography. Yes, it is true as soon as you provide us vendors with a name and addy and when we OK the order we can no longer see it. That is all.<br /><br />The dcn is true as well. So please trust SR. You buy drugs off here and even log on, so I think you can trust it enough to believe us vendors when we tell you this. Sesampino doez this same thing. Read his profile amd hewill say everything we stated.

				all communication between buyer and seller should be with pgp, whether it is conducted through sr or another medium.&nbsp; there is no such thing as being too careful, and it is foolish to trust a website (sr in this case) to provide a secure communication.&nbsp; the encryption software is free, it takes next to no effort to use it, and there absolutely no reason not to use it.

				So assuming that sr cannot be trusted what happens when another person gets your pgp key? Answer that with a definable cure to paranoia and ill submit. There isn&#039;t an answer. <br /><br />Same as email. Anyone can get your key at any given point when you give it to another person outside encryption. <br /><br />The only reason why I followed up on the op response is because I know how it works on the vendors end.

Buyers don&#039;t.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What we don&#039;t have, though, is transparency on the methods used by the SR order system to destroy this data when it is no longer needed or how effective it is.&nbsp; Not encrypting in the order leaves a single point of failure: the vendor&#039;s login details (presumably that&#039;s password and PIN, but possibly just the password).<br /><br />We have no idea, for example, whether the SR admins have the ability to view that data and I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t know that for sure either.&nbsp; One of the reasons GPG is as trusted as it is is because every line of code has been subject to peer review.&nbsp; There are no backdoors.&nbsp; SR, however, is a black box and no one is able to review anything.<br /><br />Now I am definitely not saying that there is something dodgy going on with SR, I&#039;m inclined to think that DPR and the rest of the SR team are *not* pulling a LE-backed long con.&nbsp; I am, however, saying that it is possible that there may be some as yet unknown flaw or vulnerability in the system which LE (or others) might find some way to exploit in the order system.&nbsp; The security through obscurity model employed by SR prevents the kind of review which would reveal such a vulnerability.<br /><br />Taking all of the above into account, it is quite reasonable for a buyer to choose to add a layer of security that they can verify.<br />

D:<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It can be a bit intimidating and confusing.&nbsp; I suggest taking it slowly and carefully rather than just rushing in for the quick fix, as it were.<br /><br />When it comes to GPG there have been some conflicting statements posted on the forum, but most of that stems from people who have only just discovered it.&nbsp; The best way to get a grip on GPG is probably out in the clearnet, in particular with some of the mailing lists.&nbsp; There are a *lot* of very technically savvy people on the gnupg-users mailing list and also on the Enigmail mailing list (which is for the plug-in for Thunderbird and Seamonkey).<br /><br />In places like that the promotion of effective use of GPG is for numerous reasons (all of which make great excuses for covering up the use of it here), including (but not limited to and in no particular order): general privacy concerns, political organising, activism, protecting commercial material, managing human rights organisations, minimising data mining, national security (not everyone is American and therefore have understandable objections to the NSA reading everything), etc.<br /><br />It&#039;s also essential to practice with it before diving into using it to potentially keep you out of jail.&nbsp; I&#039;ve practiced a lot and continue to do so.<br />

				Why do vendors think it&#039;s okay to threaten buyers with their personal information on the forums?&nbsp; this is extremely disconcerting for legitimate buyers, because now I need to think ot myeslf:&nbsp; &quot;are my favorite vendors *really* destroying my address once it&#039;s shipped?&quot;<br /><br />Look, guy, sometimes, buyers can&#039;t check their mail at the delivery location every single day, and sometimes, buyers can&#039;t securely access SR every single day.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry--I know it&#039;s the buyers responsibility to log on to finalize, and it&#039;s proper ettiquette to finalize ASAP once the item is received--but really, threatening with DCNs or addresses (which you claim you&#039;ve deleted, but you probably haven&#039;t) just makes you look like a disrespectful ass.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can tell you straight up that as a buyer, I&#039;ve had my money tied up in &quot;Processing&quot; for days, or marked In Transit, but not shipped for days.&nbsp; I never got all up in arms about it--we&#039;re all just people here and none of us is perfect.&nbsp; I never came to the forum and created a thread that threatened to expose the vendors packaging techniques in detail.&nbsp; I could have done just that--but all that would accomplish would be to make me look like an ass, and probably get flamed like crazy.<br /><br />Unless you&#039;re getting scammed, you&#039;re gonna get paid.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; So STFU or GTFO.<br /><br />

As well as one that I have not seen discussed on the boards. There are a lot of people here who do not know how it works on the vendor&#039;s side and the hopes were that this would inform and enlighten them. <br /><br />It dose not lower my rating if a buyer orders and then never comes back, the system will auto finalize and mark the buyers rating which looks bad to the other vendors.&nbsp; I am paid when it auto finalizes so there is no scam involved.

I am, so ill listen to me over you and those who state intelligent information that trumps what vendor knows on his end of the SR spectrum(and I fully know the superiority of pgp).

				An addendum to this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve added another GPG HOWTO which specifically deals with sending an address encrypted in an order.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=29235.0<br /><br />This shows how to encrypt a message to anyone (including yourself) without leaving any data available that could be analysed to see who the message is from and who it is directed to.<br /><br />This should thoroughly settle the issue of encrypting data in an order while preserving anonymity, even if the vendor keeps the encrypted file after the order has been finalised.&nbsp; As long as it is not saved in a decrypted form then all bases are covered.<br />
