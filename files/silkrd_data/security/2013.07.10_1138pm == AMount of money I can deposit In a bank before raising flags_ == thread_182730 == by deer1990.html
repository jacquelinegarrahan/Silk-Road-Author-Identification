				I know this topic is somewhere but everytime I use the search feature I get an error, So anyways I use my banks ATM to deposit cash into my account and then from their I send it to dwolla and exchange it for bitcoin. My concern is will depositing a couple grand a week and then withdrawling around that amount to dwolla raise any suspicions with my bank? If im every questioned what should I say ? I have a couple thousand in cash I would like to deposit so I can get some more bitcoins, but I dont want to press my luck.&nbsp; Ive thought about going to money orders, but I also dont want to look like an idiot and hold up a line while the person counts all the cash for money orders.

But anything under 9,999 is safe. You can just say you sold your boat or something, they do not need to have proof of that. It&#039;s your money and non of their fucking business. If you&#039;re in the US and need coin I can direct you to a couple vendors on the SR that will you give you coins for a bank deposit. The fee is only 10%. Msg me if you are interested.<br /><br />Regards,<br />i push the kush

				the $10,000 threshold is an old one - banks are required to report daily on any deposits or cash withdrawals they find unusual for a customer - while the legal limit is $3000, requiring them to file at the end of the day, if it&#039;s suspicious and unusual for a customer, or you have a &quot;teacher teacher&quot; teller, they can report on less<br /><br />personally, i&#039;d deposit no more than $1000 at a time 2- 3 days apart, at different branches, and try to bring it in in odd bills, to make it look like you cleaned out your piggy bank

Anything above $9,999 they hand you an IRS form to fill out. But you are right, they will notice frequent large cash deposits on a regular basis not going to a business account and they will notice quickly. Just keep it infrequent and limited to a few thousand at most. Or be smart and look into how to form your own LLC and get a bank account under that name. They won&#039;t flag cash deposits as easily as they will to a personal account.
