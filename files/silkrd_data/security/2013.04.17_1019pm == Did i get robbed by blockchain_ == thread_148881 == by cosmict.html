				Last week i made a deposit into my blockchain account. I deposited $423.95, and after fees and all i was supposed to receive just above $400 worth BTC. When the transaction went through i had only received $320 worth BTC. It wasn&#039;t just from the constantly changing value of BTC either, it says on my transactions that i only received $320. I have the payment receipt and the payment confirmation stating how much i actually deposited. I&#039;ve emailed blockchain about it and still no reply even though i got the confirmation email from them saying they got my email. What can i do now?&nbsp;

				Fuck Blockchain. I bought coins almost four weeks ago, didn&#039;t recieve them. I was asked for proof of payment, I provided it and they haven&#039;t anwered a single email I&#039;ve sent in two weeks. They took my money and fucked me right off and to make it worse my bank won&#039;t recall the payment, I can&#039;t report it as fraud and I&#039;m out of pocket while cunting blockchain support keep ignoring me. Would avoid those cunts like the plague in the future. Gutted really as I was getting A+ service until this point.<br /><br />/rant

				I just used blockchain. I deposited money and withdrew it a couple hours later. If the money makes it to the other wallet, it will have worked smoothly and accurately. <br />UPDATE: everything worked nicely

				I use blockchain for a couple wallets and I&#039;ve never had any issues at all. That being said, I&#039;ve never ordered BTC from them, just sent/received BTC and a lil Satochi Dice.

				Jesus Christ first Instawallet disappears with about $200 I had in small amounts over a few wallets and now Blockchain.info has gone AWOL with a wallet I was using for purchases that I had almost $4000 in :(<br /><br />It&#039;s becoming more and more apparent that you should NEVER trust any online wallet service with your money, as every single one of them has shown themselves to be vulnerable to hackers and DDOS attacks. I&#039;m keeping the bulk of my BTC stash encrypted with armory on an offline wallet in cold storage, with a couple of printed wallet backups stashed in safe places in-case my house ever burns down.<br /><br />With the way things are going this is the only way I feel confident storing my money, and I think in future I&#039;m going to use Bitcoin-QT for my day-to-day wallet now as well considering how much fucking money I&#039;ve lost trusting online wallets. Lesson learned, just sad I had to learn it the hardest way possible.

				If you were missing coins from your wallet, go check right now. <br />\<br /><br />I had 16 BTC in my wallet and half of it disappeared last night.&nbsp; All today it showed that I only had 9 BTC.&nbsp; And my transactions history showed that I had not made a deposit in several days,&nbsp; which was not true.<br /><br /><br />Now as I was just about to submit a ticket with support,&nbsp; I check my wallet and my 16 BTC are back...&nbsp; I don&#039;t trust these online wallets anymore.&nbsp;
