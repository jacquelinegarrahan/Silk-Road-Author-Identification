				I&#039;ve had a search through the forums and haven&#039;t found an adequate reply to the question I&#039;m about to ask. <br /><br />How do I receive money from another country without it looking suspicious to banks or the tax department?<br /><br />I may be receiving semi regular deposits over $1000. <br /><br />I could use moneygram but that in itself would look dodgy also. <br /><br />Thoughts SR&#039;s?

				Find a few trustworthy people to trade BTC/Dollars with on localbitcoins.com or a similar site. You meet with them in person every time and do it that way. Completely untraceable and unbannable (is that even a word? :P) by the government.

				Whether you want to exchange cash for BTC, or BTC for cash, you can do it locally with trusted traders. You physically receive or hand over cash in exchange for BTC. No middleman, no government, no LE, no nothing. Even in a worst case scenario where there are eyes everywhere, you can&#039;t be connected to anything but the actual monetary exchange transaction. That&#039;s why it&#039;s untraceable and it can&#039;t be banned unless physical cash is banned.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157000.msg1102279#msg1102279">Quote from: StExo on May 07, 2013, 11:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157000.msg1102268#msg1102268">Quote from: Baraka on May 07, 2013, 11:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Find a few trustworthy people to trade BTC/Dollars with on localbitcoins.com or a similar site.

				Depending on where you are in the world, you may be able to do it via Hawala. It&#039;s very anonymous and has been around for thousands of years.
