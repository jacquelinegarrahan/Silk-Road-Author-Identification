				&nbsp;I am surprised that I haven&#039;t seen any discussion here on the forum regarding the recent bitinstint issues. I would imagine this past weekend and last few days vendors have been much slower with the cash deposit option down and now they launched a new site with some major changes to the routine which includes a pretty in depth name verification procedure that makes me uncomfortable with using them. <br />&nbsp; They do a records check with some type of agency like trans union or similar and you get quiz with questions like they do if you run your own credit online. <br />&nbsp; I have to assume this is a result of some govt regulatory influence and it adds to the database the IRS and other agencies use to profile people. <br />&nbsp; I don&#039;t like what all the media attention is doing to this thing, although if not for such exposure how many of us would not have ever found this place???

				It&#039;s the same it&#039;s always been...Anyways, if you know how to use a tumbler correctly this shouldn&#039;t be an issue for you. Or just use BST

				I think there have already been some threads but there are certainly plenty of threads on BitCoinTalk.com.&nbsp; BitInstant is failing pretty hard at customer satisfaction right now.&nbsp; I was pushed to use LocalBitcoins.com today for the first time.&nbsp; The transaction went flawlessly but I had to pay a higher premium than I am used to.<br /><br />Plus Coinapult (sorry but I&#039;m still grouping BitInstant in with them since they are partners) has been holding onto $400 of my BTC for the last 8 days without any real communication.&nbsp; These companies need to learn how to better communicate with their customers.<br /><br />As for verification on BitInstant (and MtGox), as Limetless pointed out in another thread you could probably forge those scans pretty easily in my opinion.&nbsp; Plus I feel like my personal info wouldn&#039;t be of any interest unless I was pushing a lot of money / BTC or if I were already caught IRL buying or selling drugs (and they somehow knew where I got them from).

				Just would like to point out, things have been said. SR uses a tumbler, Sr does have legitimate goods on here. So I would think it pretty safe to transfer to your wallet.

				How difficult is it for someone to setup their own bitinstant? I assume it&#039;s just a matter of investing in btc, distributing &quot;tickets&quot; on your website, person brings the ticket to a shop that has agreed to accept them and they accept cash. This doesn&#039;t seem difficult to me and anyone can setup such a service and register it with the State.<br /><br />Am I missing something?

You have to register with the fed I believe for that. Almost makes you like an official bank. That is why most of the other services got shut down. They skipped that step. And with that step comes with regulations like verifying transactions with personal information.

				I think bitinstant is suffering some serious delays right now. I gave them my money 24 hours ago and still haven&#039;t received anything in my blockchain wallet. Im a newb too so this is my first try at getting bitcoins. Freaking out. lol. I didnt have to verify anything though I just signed in as a guest.

I guess I don&#039;t understand how fraud is prevented without meeting...

				There is also ESCROW in Localbitcoins! You can use it in order to secure your transaction. vendors on localbitcoins have feedback just like SR has. You can limit fraud by researching the various vendors, look at their feedback and STAY IN ESCROW.&nbsp; I have had 2 successful transactions on there so far.

				I found this dude on another forum I go to where I pay him paypal for his bitcoin. He got good amount of coins and doesnt charge me any fee&#039;s. He just wants cash and doesn&#039;t want to fuck with mtgox and I want his bitcoin and dont want to fuck with bitinstant or bank transfers. If for some reason he doesn&#039;t send the bitcoin, I always got paypal to refund my money. <br /><br />Works nicely so far.
