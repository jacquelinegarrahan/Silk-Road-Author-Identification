				hey everyone,&nbsp; <br />Does anyone know of or has anyone successfully transferred funds via bitinstant to btc adress... to SR adress.&nbsp; I guess i want to know if there is any way that they would know if it is an SR adress?<br /><br />Also, when you request a new btc address on SR, does it wipe out all of your current funds with the old adress?<br /><br />Thanks for all replies

				I&#039;ve used bitinstant directly to SR btc address probably about 15-20 times with no problems at all. <br /><br />I always use 100% fake information and always cash. I use different information every time (name/telephone number/address) and I always set everything up using a&nbsp; TOR browser.&nbsp; I also rotate between about 5-6 different RedPhone locations in my city.&nbsp; To catch me they would have to be privy to all of bitinstant/zipzap&#039;s information but even then they would have a bitch of a time catching me.&nbsp; I set up the deposit about 10 minutes before I do the deposit.&nbsp; One time they asked me for an ID and I said, &quot;you guys don&#039;t need one, I&#039;ve checked with the company&quot; and they left it alone, didn&#039;t want to see it... I also added I was paying a bill for my boss so it wouldn&#039;t make sense to have my name on it anywhere. <br /><br />Even if they found me out all I could be charged with is using false information. I think this charge is &quot;uttering a forged document&quot; but I&#039;m not sure about that charge.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing illegal about sending money to a company named ZipZap in California.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing illegal about a company taking your USD and converting it to BTC... There&#039;s also nothing illegal about forwarding somebody&#039;s BTC to an address of their choosing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything illegal about having money on a silk road account or depositing money onto a SR account. Even if they tried to argue intent one can quickly point out that there are plenty of other services/wares on SR other than illegal drugs. All this is kinda mute because nobody would be able to access your SR account to see your funds/what you&#039;re doing with them. If they know its going to a SR account thats fine but they still have no idea what user&#039;s account its going to.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a friend in a bigger city who was using silk road about 8 months ago... His dumb ass was using his real name and even using a credit card to do what you&#039;re concerned about doing... He never had any problems at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />If LE decided they wanted to look into you that hard, to where they&#039;re parked outside your house sniping whats on your computer screen etc... If you&#039;re in that deep with LE you&#039;re kinda fucked no matter how you look at it if you&#039;re getting your shit from SR or from your dealer across town...<br /><br />Just my opinion. <br /><br />-bill paxton<br />

				I use Blockchain for my online wallet. I always choose cash deposit which sets me up with BitInstant. BitInstant has me use MoneyGram to send funds to ZipZap. ZipZap sends funds to BitInstant, BitInstant sends funds to my Blockchain wallet. From Blockchain I send funds to SR. I have done many transactions this way, all of them being 100% successful. <br /><br />Fees: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MoneyGram - $0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ZipZap - $3.95<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BitInstant - 3%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blockchain - 0% unless Privacy is chosen. Privacy - 0.09%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Silk Road - $0<br /><br />And as always. Be anonymous!! Fake names, fake addresses, Tor, proxies, etc.<br /><br />And NO. Choosing a new SR BTC address WILL NOT remove any of your SR account funds. You should always change your SR PIN# and request a new SR BTC address prior to depositing funds to your SR account each time.

				Thanks everyone!!!&nbsp; But when you fill out the form using Tor on bitinstant, would they not flag that order because you are using TOR???&nbsp; <br /><br />See, i ordered btc thru a vendor via moneygram, and havent heard from him in over 3 days... i know the road was down for a while, but this is ridiculous!!!&nbsp; He hasnt even read my information...i dont know what to do anymore, i just can wait anymore!!&nbsp; Is there anyway i can cancel the moneygram???

				I always use my real information.&nbsp; It&#039;s not illegal to buy Bitcoins.&nbsp; Also I&#039;m only getting small personal amounts of bud for the most part.

				I&#039;m glad I read this before I put all my correct information on these forms or it may not have been the best idea I see. <br /><br />Does this mean that most people are split between using wallets and not using wallets for BTC?
