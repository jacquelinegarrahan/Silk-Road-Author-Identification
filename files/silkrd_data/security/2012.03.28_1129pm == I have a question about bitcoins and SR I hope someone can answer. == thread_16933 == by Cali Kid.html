				I understand how the whole bitcoin process works and all that, but my question is this, if someone posts (on SR) like for example a vial of k which I found for I think like 30-40 bitcoins or a few other drugs that looked like they were priced fairly if we were going by the dollar, but aren&#039;t bitcoins worth like 20 times the price of a dollar at the moment? So said vial of k would be 30-40 dollars times 20. So 600-800 for that vial? I looked up every other drug that had replies as being &quot;fairly priced&quot; and still got absolutely outrageous figures for them? Someone wanna help out a dumb blond? ;)

				Under settings you can convert all prices to $USD<br />Then when you checkout it converts it to bitcoins so you know how many to send for the order.<br /><br />Look at mtgox.com to find the current rate, it shows it on the main page. Think it&#039;s $4.7/per coin right now so 30BTC = ~$140 or so

				Okay, I&#039;m new but very interested in purchasing. But one thing that has me off, like OP, is the price of everything. I&#039;m looking at a listing for a certain pill that I could get for 3-4 dollars on the street but the listing is offering it for 20 USD. It isn&#039;t just this specific pill either, it seems like everything is rather overpriced. I know I probably sound like some stupid new kid, but if anyone could explain that it&#039;d be great.

Some other stuff expensive.<br />It&#039;s all about how much risk the vendor has to endure to make it worth their while, what the demand is. Really good LSD is hard to find, so the shit I buy locally is only $5-10 tab but it&#039;s shit. Good euro LSD is hard to find where I live it&#039;s sold out before it even arrives

				Yeah, I guess I wasn&#039;t taking in account shipping and the whole risk factor. Plus, from what I hear SR normally has high quality stuff. Hmm I guess it&#039;s just the prescription stimulant section that seems ludicrously overpriced.

				Thx a ton MDMAMAIL you answered my question. If the current price is closer to about $4 ish then the prices are better than I thought. Not ideal,but since you can get it safely and anonymously I&#039;ll pay the extra.. Thx also about the conversion option on SR I had no idea you could do that. Maybe I&#039;ll get some of that mdma off ya sometime ;)

				Regarding the current BTC price: preev.com has a nice convertor (using the mtgox rate).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16933.msg167796#msg167796">Quote from: RickyStan16 on March 29, 2012, 02:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, I&#039;m new but very interested in purchasing.

Also keep in mind that this is a global market, so usually you&#039;ll pay a high price for what you can easily get locally and a low price for stuff that&#039;s hard to get locally. And finally: some (most?) gear is higher quality here than what you&#039;d normally get, which might justify the higher prices.

				OK I hope this is not a faux pas but I will talk brass tacks. I am an opiate consumer. I can get high locally, for a few dollars, say 15 on a good day :- The lowest price for one bag, presumably one dose, on SR is @25, up to 35. Plus the cost of buying the btc. Add in the postage for the seller, but for yourself, deduct an amount which reflects the wait time and anxiety involved.<br />So, unless this is something incredibly fantastic, it will not, economically, displace my regular channels.<br />Plus you do see a lot of ads for stuff like $10 vicodins, makes me not want to buy, but get some and sell it.<br />I&#039;m aware this dialog must violate some SR custom, because this is the obvious analysis- can I get a better deal on SR? There are some advantages, but they are weighed out by the disadvantages
