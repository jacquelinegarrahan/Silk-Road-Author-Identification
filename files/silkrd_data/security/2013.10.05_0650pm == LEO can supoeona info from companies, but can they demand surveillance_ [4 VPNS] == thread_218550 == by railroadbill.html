				Take the case of lavabit, LEO demanded access to an email account, but they didnt ask lavabit to perform ongoing surveillance. In the case of a VPN many of them are logless but can LEO demand they start logging? Is there any reports of this ever happening?

				No, in the case of Lavabit the FBI asked for the lavabit.com SSL private key so that they could decrypt ALL web traffic into and out of the service. Lavabit gave them the key and after some time (during which the FBI et al had full access&nbsp; to all traffic in and out of Lavabit) they started feeling bad and decided to pull the plug.<br /><br />Which is a good example of why Googles recent move to SSL accross the board is so pathetic. SSL isn&#039;t broken but it is when you give the attacker the private keys.<br /><br />Regarding VPNs - yes and yes. Don&#039;t rely on commercial VPN services&nbsp; for security.

				Ah, trust no one. Certain VPN&#039;s at least in terms of DMCA have stated &quot;if we get a notice we tell them to go fuck themselves&quot;. Most of them will roll over though.

It took 7 years for it to be overturned in court, and during all that time he could tell NO ONE about it, without risking going to jail.&nbsp; The man later commented that this prohibition on talking about it was not time-limited -- rather, it was for LIFE. If the NSL were not overturned by the court, he would have been required to remain silent about it for the rest of his life. <br /><br />Who is going to risk going to jail to blow the whistle? <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

If this is the case, they might not have had enough time to use the encryption keys before the server was shut down, but again, I am not sure about this, and no matter what, we should probably start acting like everything is compromised everywhere, and (As you security gurus have said numerous times) start to build our security in layers, and act as though every layer is compromised, and just trust that these numerous layers will be enough to keep them at bay!
