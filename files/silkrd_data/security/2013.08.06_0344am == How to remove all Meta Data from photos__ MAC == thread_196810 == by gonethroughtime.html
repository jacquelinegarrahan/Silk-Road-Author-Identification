				Photos taken with phones often have a ton of exif data including GPS of where the photo was taken.&nbsp; Not sure about mac, but in Win you can right click -&gt; properties of a photo file and one of the tabs shows what exif data is present, and there is a button to click for &quot;erase all personal info&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;d be surprised if MacOS doesn&#039;t have something similar.<br /><br />Here is a clearnet website to check the exif data of photos&nbsp; &nbsp;http://regex.info/exif.cgi<br /><br />A couple other ways to get rid of exif data are (1) take a screenshot when you have the photo file open.&nbsp; The screenshot won&#039;t have the photo&#039;s exif.&nbsp; (2) upload it to photo hosting site that strips exif data; for example create an imgur account, upload file, then download hosted file without exif.

				photoshop save for web NO META DATA....<br /><br />also there are a ton of strippers out there... and hot ones too!!! BUT THATS sadly not what we are talking about here.&nbsp; do a search... grab one and u are good. the thing is to use a camera that u ONLY use for that purpose. use another camera and there are ways to match by just using the image and distortion form the lense each lense made since it is glass has properties that is UNIQUE, thinkin diamonds, and can be traced. There was a writeup about this a while back. again search is your friend. MUST.... get a throwaway camera that u OLNY use for uploading specific images u dont want attached to you. <br /><br />ummm. watch your reflections and look at the channels in photoshop sometimes u can get a print from your surface that would only show up in the red or the green or the blue channels or even switch to cmyk mode look and also lab color. use levels high and low on each when checking as well. u never know until u lighten or darken..... sometimes its there and u can miss it under normail lighting conditions

				The easiest thing to do is take a screenshot of the picture cmd+shift+3 - Then open it in photoshop, select everything and copy it into a new document.<br /><br />

				u can even go better and command shift 4 and use the cross hairs to just isolate the image u want a picture of and then u dont have to crop and those using more then one monitor dont have spare images laying ll over the place they need to trash...<br /><br />THEN u must save for the web no meta data. HAVE to do this. PLUS get the smear tool and fuck things up a bit even if its just in the red channel. SOMEHTING to help with distortion of the camera u used. DONT use stock filters its best by hand. harder to undo..
