				There is an interesting book written about that called: &quot;How to hide anything&quot;. It&#039;s on the internet in PDF. Most important is that you&#039;re original. Anything you&#039;ve seen in a movie is a bad hiding spot.

				I wont reveal my BEST hiding spot.<br />BUT, here is a good technique.<br /><br />Assuming your using something that can be taken in a powder (MDMA, 2-Cx, 4-meo-dmt, etc). You go and buy a bottle of vitamins (one that come in capsules), a pack of size 00 capsules and some vitamin c powder or brown sugar. Throw away the vitamins (unless they are weak and inert). and then fill the capsules with a dose of your drug of choice and bulk them out with the inert agent. Put them in the bottle. No one really thinks all that much of a bottle of vitamins.

				I&#039;ll tell you mine. I have removed the center hinge of one of my interior doors at a place I regular but do not live. I used a battery powered router to make a hole that the plate will cover but it is deep. Almost as deep as it goes.ends up with about a 1.5&quot; x 3&quot; x3.75&quot; little dark hole that takes one quarter turn screw to open, because one screw was cut down to about 2 threads left, and the other two were cut off at the heads and soldiered to the hinge. So when the &quot;door&quot; is closed, it is held closed by the partial screw and looks like all three screws are in place. I hide mainly blotter and from time to time vials in there. works great, and as long as your doing it at a place that you are not using your drugs, posting the how doesn&#039;t bother me.

				ill tell you my best travel hiding spotsince I dont have that car anymore, I took off the airbag cover in a 2000 jetta and removed the airbag and put a little box in there so nothing could fall threw. I could fit about a HP of pot in there.. the&nbsp; reason I dont have that car is because it got impounded a day after I got sentenced to serve some time, they impounded that along with 5000 xanax bars, I got out went to impound lot and they had already auctioned it off, so the new owner is either going to be really happy or really screwed IF anyone ever finds it.

				You need to balance ease of access with level of security.<br /><br />A super secure hiding spot that NO ONE would ever find would be to put your stash in a waterproof container and bury it off your property somewhere. BUT that would be difficult to access.<br /><br />The best spots are inside common objects. When I lived with my parents I had a computer with a side panel that could be popped off so I would hide my stash inside the computer in an unused hard drive bay. I&#039;m sure the cops know to look there but parents don&#039;t.<br /><br />An airtight container, like a surplus ammo can works well when hidden in a crawlspace or basement. Buy several surplus ammo cans and store them together in the corner of your basement, fill them with junk and in one hide your stash. Intake vents work good to hide the smell (make sure its intake NOT an outlet!) A friend of mine actually installed a fake air return vent with a bathroom fan that sucked in air and vented it out a chimney on his roof, so even if dogs were brought in they would not be able to smell it! Just remember that vents are checked so you need to make it so if they were to take the grate off and look in with a flashlight, they would not find anything.<br /><br />One of my craftiest hiding places in college was inside a radiator in the study lounge on my floor, it was usually empty and right down the hall and best of all was not even in my room, if you use at work you can hide your stash at your work.<br /><br />Its great if you are able to hide it off your property because when found, it can&#039;t be linked to you. <br /><br />Another good method is to only keep a day&#039;s supply in your residence, hide the rest in a public place. I have a friend that used to have about an ounce of H at a time, but only a bag a day in his house. He hid his stash in a mason jar inside the drop ceiling of the bathroom at his local convenience store. Everyday he would go in, use the bathroom (get his stash for the day), buy a coffee and go to work. If he ever got searched the most he would have is a bag, not a huge deal. <br /><br />If you take your drugs orally or rectally, you can dissolve them in a water bottle (make sure you measure so you know how many mg per ml are in the water) and store in the fridge among other water bottles, mark the drug bottle so you can tell them apart and use a graduated oral syringe to take out the dose you need.<br /><br />Finally, the best thing you can do is keep a clean house. This means clean as in no dirt or gross smells, also no drug references. If you are hiding a bunch of weed DO NOT have a big Bob Marley poster in your bedroom. Make your home as innocent as possible, hang a picture of jesus on the wall, make it look NOT like a drug user lives there (I know this sounds stereotypical and I know not all drug users fit the stereotype, but the police profile like crazy so take advantage of this.<br /><br />If they do search your house, you need to remain calm and be polite. If they have a warrant they can search anywhere so don&#039;t try to fight them on that it will just look suspicious. If you only have a small amount of drugs in your house like I suggested, flush them as soon as you realize its cops at your door, a security camera is a good investment for this reason, you can get a cheap setup for about $100 if you have a decent understanding of hooking up cameras. You can also buy sensors that alert you when someone pulls in your driveway or approaches your door, this might be cheaper but you will have to look out a window to check if its the cops.<br /><br />In a pinch you could eat your stash, but only do this if its amount you can handle! There is a good chance you will be with the cops for next few hours and if you start tripping in front of them that would be bad!

Then I would fill little 3ml vials with 2ml each. I would unobtrusively mark the bottoms a different color to indicate different the drugs. Purple was 2c-e, Blue was 2c-i and yellow was 2c-p. I would carry about 3 or 4 of these max at a time. If searched they smelled STRONGLY of alcohol and they wouldn&#039;t pop on any basic test as anything important. I could EASILY claim them to be shots of liqueur. Which made sense for my age. And the small amount (2ml each) didn&#039;t seem odd because you could tell it was strong liqueur (by the smell) and because the vials were all nearly full (a vial that can hold 10ml, but only has 2 looks odd).

				I don&#039;t think you can beat burying your stash off site. You have a risk of being seen when you&#039;re visiting it though.<br /><br />Use a vacuum container so smell isn&#039;t released and it keeps everything fresh. For example:<br /><br />CLEARNET LINK: http://tightvac.com
