				If you set your environment up right, deleting Tor Browser should be enough. If not, you&#039;ll probably have to wipe your drives.

				you should be fine. the tor browser bundle is designed to leave little to no trace of what you were doing.<br /><br />if in doubt, then you can do this:<br /><br />create a new user account<br /><br />migrate only your most important data to the new account<br /><br />delete old user account<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />if still in doubt, pay a technician to zero your drive and re-install osx - but this probably wont be necessary

				Why the hell do you want gpg removed man?<br /><br />gpg leaves no trace of messages encrypted or decrypted, this information is locked in the random access memory, so chill...<br /><br />Browsers, including TOR, don&#039;t have many system permissions, so there are no logs hidden in your computer. Erase all files related to TOR, wipe out all keys you have stored at gpg, and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to erase the txt files you encrypted, leave the files.txt.asc on your computer, just to troll them :)<br /><br /><br /><br />
