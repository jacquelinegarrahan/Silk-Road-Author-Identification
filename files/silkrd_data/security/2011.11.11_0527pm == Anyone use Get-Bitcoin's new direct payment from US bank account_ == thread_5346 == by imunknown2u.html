				I saw on their website as of 10/28 they are now accepting payments from US bank accounts. I started the process last week, they use an invoice program from Bank of America, and I verified my bank account with the small deposits BofA puts in my account. On Monday, after verifying, I paid the invoice. Says it takes 3 days to process, and will be delivered on 11/10. Well of course, today is 11/11 and it shows as still being &quot;In Process&quot; - just curious if anyone else used this method and if it took forever too? I guess I know now not to use this method next time. They claim for an extra $2 you can get next-day payment, but i dont know, this all seems a little ridiculous. I could have just used Dwolla is that was the case.

You said you get your BTC from get-bitcoins in a matter of hours. I used get-bitcoin&#039;s new method of getting BTC by transferring from my bank account. This whole process took a week. Therefor, compared to whatever method you used to get your BTC in hours, using their new process of transferring from your bank account is NOT as fast as whatever methods (deposit slip at BoA) is.

				I noticed that get-bitcoin.com prices do not reflect the current market rate.&nbsp; I think there might be something wrong with the site.&nbsp; I was going to do a big order but am being cautious til I hear back from them about this.

				I just used there service the other day and bought $60 worth of btc to try it out.&nbsp; I went to there site, set up a transaction (with fake name and tormail email), when i received an email from them i went to wells Fargo and paid cash (no id needed).&nbsp; I then took a picture of the receipt and sent it to my tormail account and sent get-bitcoin the picture and used the order number as the subject.&nbsp; that was at around noon on a Saturday and i had my coin around 10pm that night.&nbsp; I have heard of it taking longer/shorter but it was good for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the second not about btc to dollar rate, i think they go off the open market value which can be very dif from what we see on sr&nbsp; http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/<br /><br />for instance today it says on sr the value is around 2.25 (blah, i bought min around 3) but on the the market value link its as high as $3<br /><br />I hope this help, i would say from what i read and my experience, its the way to go for anonymity.
