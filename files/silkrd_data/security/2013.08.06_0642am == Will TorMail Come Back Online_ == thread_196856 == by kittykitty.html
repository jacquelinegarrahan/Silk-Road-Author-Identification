				Wondering if anyone knows about this.&nbsp; I have some info on there that I need (and is non-sketchy, and non-identifying).&nbsp; I&#039;m sure a lot of people are in the same boat.&nbsp; <br /><br />I read that even if they seized Freedom Hosting, there would be no Tormail emails or anything for law enforcement to gain from doing so.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure where I read this, but I was wondering if anyone could verify that.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Actually, I take that statement back. The more I read about this case, the more suspicious I am that server wasn&#039;t actually seized.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter though. I would never use Tormail again.

Naturally, that had the tormail onion site on it. But can we not suppose tormail can come back as a self-hosted hidden service? How risky would it be to assume that it is, or would there be any way to check? <br /><br />How easy/hard would it be for an enterprising anarchistic IT guy (like Astor, or kfw...), to set up a real Tormail, safe and secure and well-hidden? Wanna give it a try?<br /><br />

				Well, lots of technically proficient people could set up a similar service. I&#039;m just saying I wouldn&#039;t use the old Tormail site if it came back online.<br /><br />However, if technically proficient people are interested in running anonymous messaging services, they should build something different from email servers. I don&#039;t think email is the future of anonymous communication. We need a decentralized replacement that has no central point of failure like the Tormail / FH server.<br /><br />In fact, I see decentralization as the future of all hidden services. A few months ago I wrote a speculative series of posts about a decentralized market that hosts product listings in something similar to Bitcoin&#039;s block chain. There is no central authority that runs the market, just as there is no central authority that controls Bitcoin transactions that are added to the block chain, but people could use any escrow service they like, and that&#039;s what SR could evolve into.<br />

An open source decentralized anonymous marketplace, that would be a dream come true. But some people have been going in that direction. I&#039;ve been following the AmpedMarket and Bitwasp thing (https://github.com/ampedup/AmpedMarket). But last I checked they are still woefully behind and really, really slow in development.<br /><br />Why can&#039;t they get going? Looks like they&#039;re running into continuing difficulties, or maybe it&#039;s lack of funding. I feel funny promoting this in the SR forum (we owe Sr some measure of loyalty after all), but I have to say I&#039;d be willing to pay some part of a coin to help things along if that would really help.<br /><br />Anybody else?<br /><br />goblin

				I hadn&#039;t heard of Amped Market. Thanks for the pointer. Glad somebody is working on it. I remember when one of the Bitwasp developers started a thread on this forum over a year ago. Naturally people weren&#039;t too excited about a service that renders SR obsolete, but the way I envision it, there will be a need for escrow services in the future.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I wrote a few months ago: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157711.msg1112047#msg1112047<br /><br />Back on topic: we need something other than email. BitMessage is very insecure, and there aren&#039;t too many other decentralized messaging systems.<br />

				I hope something comes out soon similar to TorMail. TorMail was just so original and easy to use. Nothing to worry about when using it as long as you had PGP.
