				Make sure the name that you put on the Bitinstant form matches the name that you put on the Moneygram form (fake or not, as long as the names match).<br /><br />If the names don&#039;t match you will be denied at checkout!&nbsp;

				I have learned this just recently because before it didn&#039;t matter...Also I made 3 deposits today one with all my real information, another with my friends information and 2 different fake phone numbers (because I didnt remember at walmart), and the last with another friends real information but the same situation with phone numbers, the transaction went through smoothly at Walmart but upon my checking of instawallet only 1 has gone through.....Any thoughts?! What will I be able to do?!

				Wow I don&#039;t even know what to do, my $1000 is floating around out there somewhere. Should I call ZipZap and act like the other people? or call Moneygram? This is a huge buzz kill :/
