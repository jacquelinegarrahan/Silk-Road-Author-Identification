				Hello all,<br /><br />Thinking about possibly selling on this lovely road of ours.&nbsp; I have a few questions for you wonderful people.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently running the tor browser with a tormail account as my only real precautionary measure at the moment beyond firewalls and whatnot, and 40+ long digit passwords etc. <br />I&#039;m going to assume that this alone is not even close to enough security from potential law enforcement and/or attackers?&nbsp; I&#039;ve downloaded the pgp encryption software (a guide would be awesome).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m in a rather urban area and was wondering if just going to a few coffee shops twice a day to use their internet is a recommended precautionary measure?&nbsp; As I&#039;m assuming a home computer is too compromiseable? Was also thinking of purchasing a small netbook for this purpose as well.&nbsp; I was going to try and get into neighbours&#039; internets but its all WPA2 and from what I read it could take probably a week if not more to try and crack into their internet.<br /><br />Any other advice would be appreciated :)

				Read the security section of this forum, and check out the live CD called Tails.

				You seem to have done your research, just make sure you acquire and dispose of your bitcoins anonymously. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine.
