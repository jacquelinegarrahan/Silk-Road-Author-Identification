				Hey everyone! :) So, I have recently found about bitmessage and before anyone goes off on how it is not a safe alternative to tormail or anything, I am not using it for a alternative to tormail. There will literally only be one other person I am going to be communicating with using it, they will be the only one who knows my address and it is not going to be used to send sensitive information AT ALL. So please, I do not need any warnings on that.<br /><br />I have downloaded bitmessage and so has the person whom I am going to be communicating with. We both easily figured out how to generate an address, added each others addresses to our address books and when I tried to send him a message to test it out, it just says &quot;requesting encryption key, waiting on response&quot; and the same thing happens when he tries to send me a message yet neither one of use is getting any &quot;request for an encryption key&quot; Is the key something that needs to be created first or something? I have read the wiki and many other things and just do not understand...Please I hope someone can help. I am sure it is a simple fix and I really want to get this working....<br /><br />Thanks guys!

				I do not remember setting up a name and password for bitmessage...? I assume the name is an address but what about the password?

				the name is the string they give you and the password is what you have to enter to get the name. if you dont have a password then you dont have a bitmessage account.
