				I just read this over in the rumor mill, but its kinda hidden among all the reviews and just wanted to make sure people were aware of this.<br /><br />Evidently Intersango may be having funds stolen by an absconding director. <br /><br />PLEASE BE AWARE &gt; DO NOT LOSE YOUR MONEY &gt; if you use INTERSANGO, do some research and figure out what is going on <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14355.0

				Good job I read this, I was going to deposit into Lloyds tomorrow, but when ive looked at Intersango they have changed their Bank to Metro Bank...which is a pain in the ass as their isn&#039;t one anywhere near me. I dont want to do a transfer from my account as there is a trail back to me then. Any idea&#039;s on how else to get BTC&#039;s anonymously in the UK?<br /><br />goangod - the a/c &amp; s/c I had for Lloyds was 306457 / 47148668<br /><br />That sort code is deffo a Lloyds one<br /><br />

				Metro are a newish high street Bank, but only have branches in central London at the moment, which doesn&#039;t help much if you want to put ££ in over the counter but live anywhere other than London.<br /><br />I have to say that Intersango &amp; Lloyds deposits were always pretty quick (as in I had BTC&#039;s to spend within 24hrs)

				used lloyds branch for intersango payment a couple of weeks ago and it was fine - account was updated in a few hours.<br />checked my intersango acct tonight and their lloyds account is listed as well as the metro one. hopefully this means we can still deposit at lloyds rather than having to use metros. maybe it was just a temporary problem with llloyds??? hope so...
