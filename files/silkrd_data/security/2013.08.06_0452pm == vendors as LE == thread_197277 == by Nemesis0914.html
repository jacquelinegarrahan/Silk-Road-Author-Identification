				I was wondering how could we spot the sign of a vendor who is LE. I mean isn&#039;t it more dangerous as a buyer to be on SR because you have to give an address to the vendor? I know LE are highly interested in sellers however i feel buyers are still a great catch for them because for the potential importation offenses right? So tell me guys how can we stay more alert for filthy-rat- cunt- pigs.

				The only protections i see for buyers is the vendor reputations. That and your own safeguards like not opening the package right away, taking it to a separate location than where it was shipped. Otherwise, any vendor could be LE. Even ones with good reputations. They could be making sale after sale as part of a long term sting, building a good reputation and collecting addresses. <br /><br />Buyers definitely carry more risk.

				In some countries, it is considered entrapment.<br /><br />For example, in the UK, the officer cannot make the first move.&nbsp; (In this situation the first move would be listing drugs for sale on the SR)<br /><br />However, in the USA, it&#039;s only considered entrapment if the officer tries to put pressure onto the person to buy the drugs.<br /><br />If you do things correctly, it would be hard to prove in a court of law that YOU in fact purchased drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Signing for a package alone is not enough evidence to convict.&nbsp; But, if they have proof that you purchase the drugs, (money trail, internet history) then that&#039;s enough to convict.<br /><br />

				Just because its entrapment doesn&#039;t mean they wont do it, it just means that they can&#039;t use that transaction as evidence, they could then identify you and find the legal way of getting to you, If I was law enforcement I would use any means necessary then make it look good at the end lol I am not a vendor and If you are thinking of doing that I would do your homework and get paranoid.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Vendors should be more worried about other vendors being flipped and then cooperating with LE to give up their sources and or clients. This is the most common threat to any vendor/drug dealer IMO. I think LE has yet to set up vendor accounts to bust people, mostly just scammers do that. I could be wrong though and we must all assume that they would not only entrap us but then make it seem like we acted on our own will, and get us thrown in jail.

				Saw this in another thread:<br /><br />So reading the article,&nbsp; it&#039;s not entrapment for LE to empose as a childporn site and lure pedo&#039;s to give up or find out any information. So does this mean that they can become a vendor and legally send you good drugs to entrap you and arrest you later?<br /><br />****ClearWeb Warning****<br />http://gizmodo.com/why-the-fbi-ran-a-child-porn-site-for-two-whole-weeks-510247728

				I am confident there are LE as vendors, but I don&#039;t exactly see why. I figure to gain intell on the process.<br /><br />If they are selling wholesale they will be shipping to drops, where once the package is picked up the buyer is gone. I figure they could take their time to build up a very good reputation and then blow it up and nab 5 buyers. But even then a really good dealer is not picking up his own packages, he has someone else doing it for him. So it would take all of this time to nab 5 small time vendors I suppose, with 2 or 3 of those 5 getting off because the person picking up the package does not know who they are delivering the package too. It seems really really stupid and like a huge waste of time for LE to go through hundreds of transactions to nab 2 small time vendors.<br /><br />Personal quantites are ussually sent to houses so they could rack up hundreds of addresses and then spend a lot of money to raid houses. But I doubt they would be able to get a warrant because of some address.<br /><br />It may be happening but if you are smart about it you don&#039;t have anything to worry about.
