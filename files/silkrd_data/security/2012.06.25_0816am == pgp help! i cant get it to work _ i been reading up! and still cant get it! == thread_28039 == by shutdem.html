				If you&#039;re using a macbook i cant help you, so sorry. If its windows its really easy once you do it once.<br /><br />Download GPA.<br /><br />When you first open the program it will prompt you to create a passphrase. ONce you have all that done you just need to copy a vendors public key and paste it in notepad than save it to your desktop. <br /><br />Click on import. Then the desktop folder, than the file with the users public key. Now you can send that person an encrypted message.<br /><br />Next is getting your public key which is as simple as clicking your name on the key manager page it should be at the top of the list. Then click export make up a file name and save it to your desktop. Open it and when asked chose notepad to view it.<br /><br />Now copy and paste that into your clipboard. (clipboard is located next to import and export on the toolbar of gpa). Type your message under your public key in the clipboard (your address, or whatever you want encrypted). <br /><br />Next click encrypt. Choose the person who you want to be able to read the message. Then click ok. <br /><br />Copy and paste the encrypted message into the address box on SR or anywhere (message box, forums, etc.) Only the person who the message is encrypted to will be able to read the message.<br /><br />If you receive a message you simply copy and paste it into your clipboard, click decrypt, and enter your passphrase. Too easy. Good luck.

I mean i would like to set one up i guess if needed or maybe to discuss other things. but please let me know as to that part of it. So, if you could break it down with the where to dl the gpg (and i am guessing must do so from tor?) after that i mean i am a bit lost as you said one you do it you will get it down. So, after you point me in the right direction from there i willl be fine! i i will follow other steps one by one! and did i mention THANK YOU that was the fucking quickest reply i have gotten to any post! so again thank you we need to stick together! got to keep sr safe and sound!<br />thank you and thank you for further information joeyjojojr! your a good man! helping our fellow sr members!<br />let me know and thanks again. how do i give you props? like at plus to your score? or do i not have enough clout myself?<br />let me know and thank you<br />dan

				GPG and PGP are used interchangeably. GPG will do both GPG and PGP keys. PGP is the older/original software. Get GPG and use it. From what I can tell, most are using GPG right now.
