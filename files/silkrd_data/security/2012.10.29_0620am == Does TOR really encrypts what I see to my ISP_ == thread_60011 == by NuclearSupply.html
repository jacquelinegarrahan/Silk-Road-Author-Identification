				OK here&#039;s a little doubt. I see in some websites who claims to be safe in the left part of the address bar an icon with a lock and when you click it you get info about certificates and how&#039;s the site encrypted.<br /><br />My concern is that the other sites -incluiding SR and this forum- that don&#039;t have the lock when you click where it&#039;s suposed to be the icon you see a police silhouette and you read &quot;This site does not supplies identity information.&nbsp; Your connection to this site is not encrypted&quot;.<br /><br />If SR and this chat are not encrypted how our identities are protected by TOR? I thought TOR was a very potent proxy+VPN and everything was encrypted. Should I install any add-on to make my web-surfing 100% anonymous?<br /><br />Regards

				Tor is encrypted up to the exit node if you access clearnet and up to the hidden service if you access hidden services. Actually it is better encrypted than normal SSL, as it is in multiple layers (and the packets are padded to the same size!) .

				After data traffic leaves the Tor network through an exit node, it is no longer encrypted. If you connect to a website with the https protocol, the connection is encrypted.<br /><br />If you connect to a hidden service (a .onion &#039;website&#039;), then the data traffic does not leave the Tor network at all; it does not pass through an exit node, and a no point is it unencrypted (except at the two ends, your computer and the server of the hidden service).<br /><br />Therefore you don&#039;t need the https protocol if you connect to Silk Road.
