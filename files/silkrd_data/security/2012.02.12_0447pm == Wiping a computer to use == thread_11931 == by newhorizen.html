				I have an extra computer I would like to dedicate to SR use only.&nbsp; I had used it when my higher priced and bigger and better &quot;gamer&quot; machine was sick.&nbsp; It did not come with a windows 7 disk nor does it have a optical drive.<br /><br />So I did use it on my home network.&nbsp; I have some but probably not alot personal data on it.&nbsp; I will be using a different usb option to connect other than the built in WIFI, so MAC address spoofing is not really needed.&nbsp; Obviously after this is done I will not be using it on my home network!<br /><br />Basically I want to make the computer&#039;s disk like it just came out of the box.&nbsp; Am I being paranoid or should I just delete everything obvious use at a secure location with the new usb internet connection with no worries?

				You need to download and run DBAN. It will securely wipe your drive.

				I would remove the hard disks from the machine and run a Linux System with Security Protocols from a USB Thumb Drive.&nbsp; Keep the thumb drive in a special hidden place and just stick it in that machine when you want to access the TOR Network.&nbsp; When done, shut the machine down and hide the thumb drive.&nbsp; Make sure you digitally secure the thumb drive.&nbsp; This way if LE for some reason confiscates your computers you still have all your info on the thumb drive.&nbsp; If they find the thumb drive, if you have properly secured it, they&#039;re shit out of luck.

I would recommend doing that on a virtual machine. Just have a regular computer with what ever version of windows you would like. Install vmware or virtualbox, whichever you prefer. Then boot from the usb on the virtual machine. It is super secure and you can control every aspect of all the devices attached. Also, Ubuntu is a very good Linux distro. I prefer Fedora though. It&#039;s a little more open source.<br /><br />-Jimbob-

				Just DBAN it and reintall windows. Then do full disk encryption with a decoy partition. Then look into possibly going a VM route. Make a linux VM and install all the stuff you want on there and then make a VM image of it. Simply always restore from the VM image before you use it.<br /><br />Or download and boot up from liberte. Tutorial for that is in my signature.

				Thanks v01d.&nbsp; I stumbled on your thread a couple of weeks ago and forgot to save it.&nbsp; But I got it now and it probably should be sticky-icked...

				One problem is I don&#039;t know how to re-install windows because I don&#039;t have a windows operating system CD nor do I have optical drive for the machine.&nbsp; It is a &quot;netbook&quot; which makes it great being a road warrior but not so great that windows 7 just comes pre-installed. <br /><br />In this case is just use DBAN?

				Download TinyXP or something and install that if you are dead set on windows. Ideally you should use Linux of some flavour though, you will be surprised how user friendly it has become in recent years.

				BackTrack is a great Linux distro esp. if you are interested in comp/network security.
