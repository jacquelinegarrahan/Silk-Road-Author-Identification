				&nbsp; I used the search function but don&#039;t quite have what I feel are &quot;correct&quot; answers.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for answers to a few questions regarding getting lost.<br /><br />&nbsp; I see the fake ID&#039;s for sale on SR.&nbsp; I read all of the feedback...which was sometimes disturbing, and feel more lost than when I started.<br /><br />&nbsp; So someone wants to start over without having the proper paperwork.&nbsp; The obvious first step is to get a passable ID which scans at bars or stores for those that are underage.&nbsp; I want a step further...scrutiny at a traffic stop.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Let&#039;s assume that someone has all of the information needed to reproduce a real person&#039;s ID. (DL number, address, DOB, SSN, exp date, etc)&nbsp; If that someone were to purchase a quality fake ID from a trusted vendor on SR, would that ID withstand a scan through LE computers being it holds real information of a legal driver??&nbsp; (Assuming the stats like age, height, eyes are similar enough)<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; I have heard that LE in many states now use facial recognition software in their cruisers...meaning when they scan a license, they receive the license holders picture as well. Can anyone verify if that is true, and if so, which states are not a part of that system?<br /><br />&nbsp; I welcome any help, advice, criticism in this area by someone(s) with real knowledge on the subject.<br /><br />&nbsp; I would also welcome input on quality ID vendors on SR.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				The simple answer is no. Such an id would cost $10, 000+ and is generally reserved for the sucessful super criminal with more money than sense. If they run the identifier an the licence the worst part is they wont tell you they know its fake they will let you dig a bigger hole for yourself before 30mins in back up arrives. I have no experience in the matter but it seems simple to me. Id also expect the onboard computer to have a blown up picture of the license holder.

				&nbsp; That&#039;s about what I figured considering in my searches, $15k was the asking price for a complete set.&nbsp; Meh...I guess I can use fake credentials for working, but crappy part is that those credentials last only months until tax season...then the jig is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;

What happens when tax time comes and there&#039;s a record of two people working at two different places with the same info? Are you not at all worried. I&#039;m in the same boat and just worked cash somewhere cause it seemed to be the least risky situation.
