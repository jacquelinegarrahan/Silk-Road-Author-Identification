				Bitinstant cash desposit at major bank &gt; coinapult through TORmail &gt; instawallet &gt; SR<br /><br />1. Anything I&#039;m missing or need to know in terms of this method?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read I can do all of this anonymously behind TOR (which sounds VERY appealing), but I currently can&#039;t get the homepage where you begin the deposit process on bitinstant to load correctly.&nbsp; I also read somewhere to avoid accessing bitinstant through TOR was a way to get flagged; should I not be using TOR to access it?&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Is instawallet necessary?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read conflicting things.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had originally planned to go the MTGox route, but this certainly feels a lot better based on what I&#039;ve been reading.&nbsp; I have no desire to muck about with this stuff online outside of TOR.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done my research the best I can and would appreciate any thoughts or comments on this.&nbsp; Thanks

				You&#039;ve got the right idea with the cash deposit method, it&#039;s probably one of the most anonymous methods of obtaining coins.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used Coinapult, but I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s a service similar to BitcoinFog, which is a good idea.<br /><br />As far as Instawallet goes, it&#039;s a good service, but it&#039;s not really cleaning your coins like BitcoinFog is.&nbsp; What I mean is, if someone wanted, they could watch where your coins go from Fog/Coinapult to Instawallet, then to SR, but they won&#039;t know they&#039;re *your* coins; you purchased them anonymously and then cleaned them.&nbsp; So, use Instawallet if you want, but I&#039;m not sure it can do much for you compared to your other methods.

				This is *EXACTLY* the method I use.&nbsp; You&#039;re buying your coins anonymously with the cash deposit, you&#039;re retrieving through an anonymous email, you&#039;re depositing into an anonymous ewallet account (using TOR), and then all these anonymous coins are going to SR (which, eventually, will get tumbled in itself).<br /><br />I say this is as solid as anything.<br /><br />Good luck to you and happy buying :)

				Stay away from get-bitcoin. They are a known selective scam and even if they do come through for you their service is very slow and dishonest. Bitinstant is a far better option

				I&#039;ve still yet to think of a public computer which wouldn&#039;t in some way lead back to me (hence the anxiety over Mt Gox).&nbsp; It seems like libraries no longer allow any computer access without ID, and there don&#039;t seem like many other options outside of using my own computer over some public wireless network.&nbsp; That has obvious downsides.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll probably just take my chances with Bitinstant through TOR -- it&#039;s not going to be a crazy amount of money anyway, and I haven&#039;t read any reports of anyone getting screwed that way.&nbsp; Still debating whether or not I should use Bitcoin Fog after....

				I really wouldn&#039;t sweat it. Buyers don&#039;t seem to be targeted. Not that you shouldn&#039;t remain vigilant, but like you said it&#039;s not for a huge amount of money anyway and you&#039;re moving it IN not OUT.

				I&#039;d revise your plan to:<br />bitinstant -&gt; coinapult -&gt; tormail -&gt; bitcoin fog -&gt; silk road<br /><br />It takes about 10 hours, but I think the wait is worth it. You&#039;ll be charged about 6% total (total accumulation of small fees at each step) so bear that in mind when deciding how much to deposit.<br /><br />You can do the entire thing over Tor (bitcoin fog and tormail require it). And don&#039;t worry about accessing bitinstant over Tor. They have no way of knowing who you are, and you don&#039;t need to create an account, so there&#039;s no one and nothing to &quot;flag&quot;. Each time you deposit money this way, it will look like a completely new person to them.<br /><br />When you take your cash to the bank, you don&#039;t need to give them any information at all. I just act professional and uninterested when I&#039;m at the bank, and the teller hardly even looks at me, let alone asks me about anything other than what she needs to complete the transaction.<br /><br />I see a lot of people ask the question, &quot;Is bitcoin fog really necessary? It takes too long&quot;. Is your freedom worth an extra six hours? It&#039;s probably not necessary, no. But isn&#039;t six hours worth turning &quot;I&#039;m probably safe&quot; into, &quot;I&#039;m almost certainly safe&quot;?
