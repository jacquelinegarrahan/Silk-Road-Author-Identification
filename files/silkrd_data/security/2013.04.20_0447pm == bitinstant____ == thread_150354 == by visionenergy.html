BitInstant couldn&#039;t be easier. (there&#039;s a walk through right on the site)<br />Select Cash deposit, (Pay from?)from the left column, from the drop down menu pick the place you prefer to do the deposit. (I&#039;ve found Walmart to be the most anonymous). <br />On the right side(Pay to?) choose either bitcoin to email, or bitcoin address. (I use bitcoin address) - Go to your &#039;account&#039; page on SR and copy your BTC address, then go back to the Bitinstant site and paste it in there. -Then it will want your 1st name, Last name and DOB. - If you&#039;re paranoid, make it all up, they never ask for ID (CVS does btw), - I usually use my real name, and only alter my DOB, as I do for any website. Just remember what name, spelling, DOB you use, so if you&#039;re asked, you&#039;ll have it. Then it will take you to a ZipZap page, and ask you to put in your town. This is just to find the nearest location.&nbsp; You can put a neighboring town. Doesn&#039;t really matter. <br />Then it will give you an &quot;invoice&quot;. The info you&#039;ll need on there is a 4 digit pay code, and an account number. Also the name of the company ZipZap, and their location San Fran, CA. <br /><br />That&#039;s it! Now go to Wal-Marts courtesy desk, and look for the Moneygram slips. Grab a Blue one, and go sit somewhere (Dunkin Donuts) and fill it out. <br />Here they want your name, address, and phone number. Again, if you&#039;re going to use a fictitious one, be sure to keep the receipt, because the first time, they put you in their &#039;system&#039;- They&#039;ll sometimes say, &quot;You&#039;re not in our system&quot;. - You can say whatever. &quot;This is my first time using them&quot; but the next time you go to do it, they&#039;ll simple put the phone number in, and not ask any questions, as you&#039;re already in their system. <br /><br />The amount that says &quot;PAY THIS AMOUNT&quot; on the ZipZap form, is the amount you put down. - There is no Zip Zap fee, if they ask. They shouldn&#039;t though. <br /><br />Hand the clerk the filled out Moneygram slip, and just wait for them to ask you for the money. They&#039;ll then pass you a receipt and ask you to sign it. Sign it. <br />They give you your copy stapled to the moneygram slip, and say &quot;Thank You&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s it! <br /><br />-Always a good idea to grab a few extra moneygram slips, this way you can do it all at home, and save printer paper and ink!<br /><br />Also the clerk may ask &quot;are you sending money or paying a bill&quot; - You&#039;re paying a bill. <br /><br />That about covers it! <br /><br />Been doing this for over a year now, and have only had a minor glitch here or there where the btc took longer to show up than expected. Never had any major problems. <br /><br />Weekends it can take longer. - On weekdays it&#039;s in my SR account by the time I get home from Walmart. <br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />jagfug 8)

				I always use Bitinstant. Like Jag said, make up name, address &amp; number to put on the Moneygram Express Pay form. My first transaction I deposited directly to my SR BTC address. The next time, I used an intermediate e-wallet, then SR address. This last time, I picked the Mt. Gox option and when I did this, I had a confirmation e-mail that the funds were in my Mt. Gox account BEFORE I left the counter. This way, I can go home and wait for BTC to drop in value and have a buy order on Mt. Gox set up for the desired rate to buy them at. If you are very impatient, such as myself, you can check &quot;Buy at Market Value&quot; and get your coins right away. Note though, when you withdraw your BTC to an e-wallet or SR BTC address, it can take 30 minutes to a few hours, and THAT is choosing the &quot;Faster Processing time for .005 BTC&quot; option.

				Thanks a lot guys, that really helps.&nbsp; I still have a question about the fees though.&nbsp; I saw somewhere that there was a 3.9% Fee for using bit instant.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; I think I saw it on Mt.Gox site when I choose the Bit Instant Option.&nbsp; That&#039;s a pretty steep fee in my opinion.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using Dwolla to Mt.Gox and I don&#039;t think there is much of a Fee that way.<br /><br />Thanks again for the help

				I&#039;ve stuck with BitInstant for over a year now. The times I used MtGox as a middleman, it just added another fee. Dwolla sucked the worst! I&#039;m not sure about their fee, but the turnover was like days!! That may have changed. - Everybody charges a fee. Bitinstant direct to SR btc wallet, is fast, and safe. There have been some problems here or there, you&#039;ll see people complain once in a while. Things do glitch up sometimes, but the people at BitInstant have always been very accommodating, and corresponded with email, or text, whichever I chose. They&#039;ve been doing what they do the longest, ie; offering cash deposits at many locations. They&#039;re also heavily scrutinized by authorities that are on the lookout for money laundering. Which makes me laugh at these children that have a temper tantrum when something goes wrong, and these idiots threaten to report them to authorities. <br /><br />If there&#039;s ever a problem, just be patient, and polite, and you&#039;ll be helped before the little kiddies that talk all tough, and use profanities, and threaten to call some department of something they don&#039;t even know what their talking about. - Something tells me, the ones that act like that, are put on the &quot;take care of last&quot; pile.&nbsp; If you know what I mean. <br /><br />You&#039;ll catch more flies with honey.&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />

There is a red phone. If you already have an account, all you have to do is enter the information. It&#039;s all automated. Your account is tied to the telephone number you gave them the first time. So, you can probably use all fake information and all you need to remember is the telephone number that you gave them. However, I was asked for ID once. But bitcoins are legal. They don&#039;t know where they are going or what you are using them for.

I&#039;ve lost hundreds both times I used them because the market tanked between the time I received them&nbsp; and the time I was able to spend them. I&nbsp; prefer buying btc when I&#039;m ready to spend them. When you buy $1,000 btc, it can literally take you 2 hours to lose $300. Of course, the opposite is also true, but it just hasnt been true for me :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My bad- I&#039;m sorry.&nbsp; It was the way I worded that. - I was looking at &#039;other&#039; complaints against them, and of the few I looked at, there was one where the buyer made a mistake, and that&#039;s what started the whole problem. -His complaint was with them not fixing it fast enough. So I was typing as though I were talking to the guy that fucked up his own order, and then blamed BI for not fixing it fast enough.<br /><br />I have no idea about your transaction. - My apologies for the confusion.

				bitinstant ripped me off about a month ago.&nbsp; never again.<br /><br />they held my money hostage for a week, so i had to contact the company that handles the cash deposits for a refund. after they contacted bitinstant they sent me some bitcoin, but it was 25% less than what I paid for.&nbsp; now both companies are ignoring me.<br /><br />fuck bitinstant.

				Damn, BitInstant is being a cunt. I wanted to buy a half sheet of LSD for the first time, but they&#039;re experiencing &quot;minor delays that should be resolved within a few hours&quot;. I hope I can still buy it. :-\

				From my experience, if it doesn&#039;t show up on Blockchain within five minutes of depositing then there&#039;s going to be a delay. It&#039;s a shame, but the good thing is BitInstant has never failed me. They can be slow at times, but always come thru... let&#039;s try to stay calm for now. :)<br /><br />Edit: Order processed. 8)
