That&#039;s easy, just transfer instantly to Mt.Gox and buy BTC at mt.gox rate. Sure it&#039;s not the most secure since trail leads straight back to dwolla and bank account transfer to dwolla with your name on it, but it&#039;s not like you&#039;re doing anything wrong. Just buying btc. You can always wash coins by transferring btc to washing service before transferring to SR account wallet if you&#039;re paranoid. But I wouldn&#039;t sweat it unless you&#039;re talking about over 10k transfer.

				www.get-bitcoin.com<br /><br />I&#039;ve used this service many times over the last six months. Using an anonymous email address, you can do these transactions anonymously with a 5% fee.<br /><br />Send to your personal wallet address first then transfer to your wallet at SR.<br /><br />The following is taken from the GetBitccoin web site:<br /><br />Update 5/25/2012: GetBitcoin is proud to announce our new cash deposit service, provided in partnership with BitInstant and Coinapult. BitInstant&#039;s cash deposit program, launched earlier this week, will allow our customers to get Bitcoins from depositing cash at more than 700,000 locations. In addition to Bank of America and Chase, we now support cash deposit at Citibank, Wells Fargo, Walmart, MoneyGram, 7-11 and CVS. Cash deposit will become even faster - since order fulfillment is automated, orders will be fulfilled within an hour of depositing cash. And this new service comes with the same low, 5% fees our customers have come to expect. For more information, feel free to contact us at support@get-bitcoin.com.<br /><br />Check out our new review thread on the Bitcoin forums:&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34812.0<br />

				Having said what I said in my previous post concerning get-bitcoin.com:<br /><br />Even though BitCoins are legal, I know that LE is always looking for ways to track whatever so I caution everyone to acquire BitCoins using the most anonymous method possible. I feel that; cash by mail and cash deposits at the bank are best where get-bitcoin.com is concerned.<br /><br />I used BTCKing on SR the other day, made a cash deposit at CHASE, as instructed, and had coin in my SR account in less than an hour. I also had this horrible feeling that I just connected my SR account with a zip code.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, but maybe LE has agreements with the banks to flag images whenever deposits are made to certain accounts known to accept deposits for BitCoin transactions. My true identity could be discovered if LE uses their sophisticated facial recognition software to compare bank security cam images with imagery from various sources like the DMV.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is that paranoid? I don&#039;t know, but it does cross my mind.

				Dwolla says surprise we won&#039;t give your money to mt.gox or anyone else fishy until we have held it for 30 days.. so I have 20 more days to wait unless I can find a place to give it to from Dwolla that I can get into BTC&#039;s from.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thing is how does them holding my money for 30 days and me doing nothing else prove trust?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t&nbsp; It just allows them to gain interest on tons of people&#039;s money.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not a bigwig.&nbsp; I&#039;m liking the CVS/Wallmart idea just to get my first transaction done.&nbsp; The BtcKing sounds too much like it could be feds because banks all have detailed cameras and deal with things in an orderly fashion.&nbsp; Wallmart is chaotic and another step removed from it being a federalli thing like &#039;banking&#039;

The date and time of each deposit, even cash is stored on computer. Our own bank has three security cameras by the counters - mainly I think in case of an attempt at robbery than to identify individual customers.<br /><br />British banks have a system in place for flagging accounts for further investigation but the actual intel gathering is not usually our responsibility. There is a procedure for filing SAR&#039;s (Suspicious Activity Reports) which are then investigated by specially trained Police Officers. In my last run in with them I mentioned the Bitcoin in passing as we were talking about money laundering (in general terms!) and one of the more senior officers hadn&#039;t heard of it. His younger (female) colleague had though.<br /><br />My own bank which in fairness is not one of the major ones stores security camera footage for three years (Data Protection laws will vary based on where you live).<br /><br />I have to declare my interest at this stage and say I do sell Bitcoins for cash in the mail but this doesn&#039;t make the above any less true! If you must make cash deposits in the bank I would suggest you use one of the deposit points where you can leave cash in an envelope - we have these in most high streets banks in the UK and I assume the same is true in the US? That way it would only be possible to prove you entered the bank that day, not that you had specifically deposited cash into your BTC exchange providers account.<br /><br />Of course this won&#039;t do you much good if they simply stop processing transactions as this provider has but patience is a virtue, I&#039;m sure Intersango will resolve this crisis soon...<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Concern of bank deposit only. Bank = fed cameras. You deposit you have a date time amount and block chain transaction linked to their cookie jar of freely accessible location based surveillance cameras. If this is your method employ a homeless man and next time have a buddy that moved far away employ another homeless man. After all the homeless man needs booz too.

Tell them you want to wire it back to your own bank account (or whatever method you used to get money INTO your Dwolla account to get it back to you) and to terminate your Dwolla service.&nbsp; That is YOUR MONEY and you should never have to wait 30 days to do what you want with your money.&nbsp; I remember a bank once telling me that I would need to wait 30 days to access the funds from a sizable paycheck I was depositing from a new job. My bank manager sorted out those bitches real quick when I called her to complain. Are you on checksys? Can&#039;t understand why else you might have to wait that long, but even if you are that&#039;s bullshit. Tell them you want your money back.<br /><br />If you have access to cash now and went to make a purchase today here&#039;s the easiest way:<br /><br />1. Buy Moneypak. (Up to $300&nbsp; at 7-11 or $1100 at Wallmart) <br />2. Purchase BTC from SR vendor with MoneyPak, ideally Coinbox as his fee is only 1-2%. &quot;BTC Buddy&quot; is also reliable exchanger although his 10% is more than I would pay. Not sure what Vlad charges but you should PM any of these vendors to work out a rate.<br />3. Buy drugs of choice with funds from your freshly topped up SR btc account.<br />4. Wait in agony while anticipating the arrival of your freshly purchased drugs.<br />5. Do drugs.<br /><br />As you can see, it&#039;s really only a two step method since the rest is reflexive.<br /><br />IF you can&#039;t find Coinbox and don&#039;t want to pay the 10% that just about every other SR vendor I&#039;m aware of charges, then do this:<br /><br />Bank of America deposit -&gt; Bitinstant -&gt; mt.gox -&gt; SR<br /><br />Go to bitinstant to find out anonymous deposit details because you don&#039;t need to open bitinstant account to do it this way.<br />

I really, really would urge you to do a little homework into this and look at contributions by previous posters though as it&#039;s obviously important you know what you&#039;re doing - you also might find a BTC trader can get their money to you faster than using an exchange. Silk Road isn&#039;t going anywhere, so you can take your time.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Fuck online BTC Traders. That still requires doing some legwork to find a trustworthy one, as well as familiarizing oneself with trading protocol&nbsp; which it sounds like Cowpie34 would prefer not to spend one minute longer doing.<br /><br />Cowpie if you want to ensure anonymity going the bitinstant route then just hit the bitinstant site using your TOR browser.<br /><br />If I were you I would go to the store and get your MoneyPak now, then PM Coinbox and be ready to pounce when he replies. He&#039;s on here daily so look out for an announcement by him on his thread that he&#039;s arrived and ready to do business. Plus he doesn&#039;t even appear to be charging any interest yet on orders since he&#039;s trying to build rep at this point.&nbsp;

				Found this one a while back, courtesy of usp6615gawd. Seems to be pretty thorough with low fees, though it does take a while:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. Buy money order with cash at a random post office in the area (the smaller ones that don&#039;t have cameras).<br />2. Send money order to Campbx using a return address of a local charity and a fake name/account/email. Printed labels for the envelope<br />3. Wait for money to show up in Campbx account and then trade for bitcoins as necessary (all through tor)<br />4. Tumble random chunks of the total amount through multiple instawallets before sending to SR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Two possible though minute concerns/weaknessses:<br />1. Might want to wear gloves when handling stuff you are going to send to Campbx. Technically this would include when you go to the post office to buy the money order. Or you could use a vulcanized rubber dry-cleaning sponge to remove fingerprints afterward.<br />2. If you withdrew cash directly from your bank account, then proceeded to purchase a money order, then the cash you used could potentially link your bank account to the purchase of that money order. For this reason, it might be wise to buy a money order for a significantly different amount than you withdrew.<br /><br />Both of these suggestions are probably overkill for personal amounts.

				I was on the moneygram website and it&#039;s all bank account this or credit card that. Can I just use physical cash to do a moneygram the same way you would use cash to put onto a MoneyPak?<br /><br />Or maybe I should stick to MP&#039;s &gt; BTC vendors but 10% fee is ridiculous. Considering SR vendor Coinbox atm but I think he only exchanges on weekends or something.

Yeah, like JamesFranco mentions above in his cut and paste of my earlier message, if you use bitinstant they only charge 4%.<br /><br />Coinbox was out of a connection for 3 days as his ISP was sold and transferred, but he said he&#039;ll be back with coins on Saturday, if you can wait that long, but he was pretty consistently around on weekdays before that. But since he doesn&#039;t seem to be charging commission right now all you pay is the MoneyPak fee.<br /><br />I still think the best and cheapest way is to find a local seller IRL using btcnearme.com. That way you just go to their place or wherever they want to meet, give them cash for BTC where everything is done right on the spot. If I pay anything at all it&#039;s around 2% to a bitcoin activist doing it to promote the currency. I&#039;ve found 3 helpful sellers in my area that have been too cool.<br /><br />

				When using bitinstant i notice only three fields. 1.destination 2. amount 3. &#039;notification email.&#039; I&#039;m assuming that when you deposit the money and you recieve an email for your deposit you enter that notification email into this field for bitinstant to pull from. Is this correct?
