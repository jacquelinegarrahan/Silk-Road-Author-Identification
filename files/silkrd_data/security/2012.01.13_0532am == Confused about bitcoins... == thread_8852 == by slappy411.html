				Ive been trying for hours to simply purchase some &quot;bitcoins&quot; and right when I get close, I get a screen that wants my name, address, etc etc. I thought all of this is supposed to be anonymous. Now Im hearing that the only thing close to anonymity is &quot;Moneypack, which they are supposedly cracking down on. I would really like to try a few things on SR, but am about ready to give up!!! Anyone have a simple way to obtain some &quot;bitcoins&quot; anonymously? <br /><br />Thanks<br />Slappy

				It&#039;s not important to buy them anonymously per se, but to anonymize&nbsp; them after you buy them. For instance, what would be a good idea:<br /><br />bank deposit for bitinstant &gt; tradehill &gt; wallet on your computer. <br />Have your wallet proxied through tor. <br /><br />Send 1/3 of my bitcoins to three different instawallets, and then&nbsp; just make a load of dummy transactions, then deposit them into your SR and change the address for each deposit. <br /><br />Also SR has a built in tumbler. Nobody is going to go through the hassle of going through all that to prove you were the one who bought THOSE bitcoins. And buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, so nothing wrong with them knowing you have bought them before.

				Go to silkroad forums.<br />Go to money. <br />Read seller rating<br />(Now there is two routes to go)<br />Option A. Intelligent way<br />Read through reviews, pick a good seller.<br />Option B. Guess<br />Get fucked over for your money and come post about it here<br />Option C. Mtgox <br />Use a lot of transferring through wallets.

				If you are in europe and can get some paysafecards, that is imo the cheapest and most anonymous way.<br />You can buy them without showing any ID or whatever at gas-stations, kiosks, etc. and exchange them for BTC at various vendors,<br />I recommend DutchQualityBeans, really low fees (if at all).<br /><br />So the BTCs cannot be traced to you from the start, and you don&#039;t loose a lot of money in the conversion process.
