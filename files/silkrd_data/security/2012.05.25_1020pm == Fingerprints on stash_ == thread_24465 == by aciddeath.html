				Hypothetically speaking....<br /><br />Let&#039;s say someone I know attracts the attention of the USPS through a poorly packaged drug shipment<br />and instead of controlled delivery they opt to raid the address<br />and by some incredible miracle (dumb luck) they discover a hidden drug stash<br /><br />Are chances high that fingerprints can be pulled from vials, baggies, pills?<br />Should hidden drug collections be handled with only gloved hands and wiped clean?<br />Can you just &#039;rub&#039; fingerprinters off?<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				If the police are already in your &quot;friends&quot; house and they have found your drugs then whether they check for fingerprints is irrelevant. Yes you could wipe all fingerprints off vials and you could wear gloves to handle them. If you were a vendor I would assume this is standard practice for the posting of any items. Buyers attract less LE interest unless you were buying off SR and selling locally, but I digress.<br /><br />If you have a lot of drugs then you could attempt to deny ownership if you were certain your fingerprints or DNA are anywhere near them. Of course if that&#039;s the case you need a plausible reason as to why they were there and why there were no fingerprints.

				Definitely stoned when I wrote the thread.<br /><br />On the subject as to why they&#039;re there and why they have no fingerprints....<br />Doesn&#039;t the law have to prove beyond a doubt that you intended to possess drugs?<br /><br />If they are hidden in an unlikely and old location (detached from the &#039;main&#039; structure which only contains marijuana/scale) that has been rented by generations of folks you would think it would be just slightly more difficult to prove intent than if your prints were all over the stuff

				If they find drugs in your house they already have the evidence they need IE the shit is in your house weather or not your prints are on it is irrelevant they would say then...&nbsp; what the shit walked into your drawer lol.&nbsp; Plus it cost money and they dont need to waste it when they already have you.

				I would always make sure to wear gloves when handling drugs that can have prints pulled from them, like LSD sheets or pharmaceutical and mdma tablets.

				If you do not live by yourself, your story of not knowing anything about it is much more plausible if your prints are not all over it.

				lol. I think I herd something like this before. I am here to share what I do. Its called superglue. Yes it is a bitch later on, but in order to ID a fingerprint it has to match on X amount of nodes or similarities. If one was to use superglue, and a bleach rag (after it is packed, bleach kills allll, it is great to keep around) the superglue changes those nodes so a match is 99% not likely, gloves and bleach give me that 100%. <br /><br />The other day I bought leather driving gloves and keep chlorox wipes for after I put them on. Safety is smart, and I TOTALLY understand paranoria in this kind of forum and business. But if user A is doing small shipments and user B just shipped 1,000 tabs, who is a bigger fish to fry. I know I know, Uncle Sam will fuck everyone they can, but think of the numbers, take the proper safety measures, and dont stress yourself to death. Just be smart, and I know you are :)

				One of our re-shippers likes to use a &#039;outdoor&#039; rock stash since most search warrants tend to only cover a &#039;specific&#039; location/address, apartment #, house,# ect, so a &#039;very&#039; well hidden outdoor &quot;rock-stash&quot; (using &quot;waterproof&quot; bags from a camping store, ect , and either by following various instructions online and/ or using plaster molds, ect, with (perhaps?) the 3-D &quot;Rock-style&quot; spray paint from craft stores (like Michael&#039;s, ect.) works &#039;very&#039; nicely as well. Mostly helpful if you don&#039;t live &quot;inner-city&quot; of course. Just google &quot;how make rock fake spray paint&quot; or whatever. Get some night vision goggles if your really &quot;Perma-noid&quot; about things. And &#039;ZERO&#039; worries. :)<br /><br />But &quot;much&quot;, MUCH better yet, just rent a cheap, small local storage room or &quot;art/music&quot; studio with a fake ID. Best &#039;stash&#039; ever in case of a &quot;raid&quot; at your home address for any reason. :)<br /><br />But &quot;of course&quot; keep your prints off &quot;everything&quot; if it&#039;s within a (likely) legal search warrant radius. That&#039;s why (unless you have a few acres and holes to dig) &quot;off-site&quot; storage is best. <br /><br />Hell, even just for &quot;small-time buyers&quot; wishing to keep small things, scales, goodies, ect&nbsp; stored &quot;off-site&quot; (yet easily accessible) just &#039;easily&#039; rent a cheap PO box from a small &quot;mom n&#039; pop&quot; place, and just use your mailbox as &#039;storage&#039;! All (of course) in fully addressed envelopes, Priority Box&#039;s, ect, with postage applied of course. The small, &quot;family run&quot; places won&#039;t even notice or think twice about it. ;)<br /><br />Perhaps even keep your &quot;dirty&quot;encrypted&nbsp; hardware/flash drives, ect well hidden this way? Far cheaper than renting a storage room or &quot;art&#039; studio. With &quot;very&quot; little worries. Just watch your back and keep some random &#039;junk mail&#039; coming in now and then to make it seem even more &#039;legit&#039;.<br /><br />This is how we used to do things in the past (with 100% success), but we now use even more &quot;stealthy&quot; methods (which will not to be revealed of course). <br /><br />But these things work. For &quot;everyone&quot;. BIG...or &#039;small&#039;.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Peace <br /><br />TFC
