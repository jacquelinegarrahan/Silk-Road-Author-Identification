				It doesn&#039;t look like the spam is being cleaned up since i&#039;ve been online today ( a few hours so far ) and i want to be able to do something about it! I msgd Nomad earlier about making me a mod but he&#039;s still offline.

				It&#039;s not that bad .&nbsp; Just a few here and there.&nbsp; I think they do a pretty good job. <br />I think Nomad is not a moderator anymore.&nbsp; His signature line says so, check it out In one of his posts .&nbsp;

				A few here and there? It looked pretty hectic a few hours ago. Ok i didn&#039;t see his sig before i pm&#039;d him.<br /><br />Either way i want to play a part in the forum other than my usual drivel. The forum was plastered in spam earlier and it seemed like no one was around to stop it from happening. I would like to be in a position to do just that.

				I, for one, was on from 9am until 3:30am yesterday ... that&#039;s 18+ hours ... I deleted all the spam that came in during that time, but none of us can be online 24/7.&nbsp; I think 18/7 is pretty damn good.&nbsp; I&#039;m back on now and will delete it.

				Yes big props to scout for pulling &quot;double shifts&quot; pretty much!<br /><br />I missed the majority of the spam fiasco due to being absent for a couple of months and when i came back here the place seemed like it had turned to shit while i was away&nbsp; :( Where&#039;d all the love go? Now it&#039;s just a mess of spammers, scammers, newbs and trouble makers.. Even the mods i seen around back then have packed up and fucked off..

				Scout- you are doing a good job... but... on a burn-out pace. Why is there not more moderators on SR? It seemed before they were more mods present on several area of the forum (I&#039;m not inferring you aren&#039;t putting time and energy by any means..) I find it odd that DPR would pair back resources

				I think they are doing a good job. I barely notice the spamers anymore.<br /><br />Only 2 mods on a form this active? <br /><br />You are doing a great job so don&#039;t take stuff personally. Being a mod is at times a thankless job. <br /><br />No one likes the new section but they will get over it and see why it was necessary and it is working. Post quality down there is even improving.

				What does DPR do with all his massive escrow money? He can&#039;t pay mods? Guess Agorists are the cheapest people on the planet.<br /><br />On Russian crime forums when you&#039;re mod you get let in on all the best ops, cards, logins and the admins throw money and freebies to you all the time.&nbsp; Otherwise you&#039;re like fuck this circle jerk hassle and the place is overrun with scams and spam<br /><br />
