				Hey all ...<br /><br />So, when I was browsing the forums yesterday I saw this message pop up in Vidalia&#039;s message log --<br /><br />Potentially Dangerous Connection! - One of your applications established a connection through Tor to &quot;*************&quot; using a protocol that may leak information about your destination. Please ensure you configure your applications to use only SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 with remote hostname resolution.<br /><br />I know exactly what app caused this.&nbsp; I work from home and like to browse the forums while I am working.&nbsp; I make it a habit to NEVER open SR unless I am doing so from my bootable USB ... But thanks to being stoned out of my mind I forgot and I read something on the forums that made me want to check something on SR.&nbsp; So, I had 1 tab opened in SR and was logged in (buyer account, not vendor) and several opened on the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />So anyway, my question is this ... do I scrub the account that I had opened during the time frame that the above message popped up?&nbsp; My gut is telling me that is the safe thing to do, but wanted some other opinions as well.&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to lose my perfect buyer stats, but not as much as I&#039;d hate to have the storm troopers break down my door.

				If you were loading a hidden service and it actually loaded that is a pretty good sign that you didn&#039;t actually have a DNS leak.

				Thanks again, I appreciate the help and the info.&nbsp; It did load.<br /><br />Still, I think I am going to do away with the account.&nbsp; I remember enough details that I can let a vendor know about the other account and have them look up the stats if they need to.&nbsp; I know exactly how many bitcoins I&#039;ve spent, number of purchases, etc.<br /><br />Nothing like a simple &#039;scare&#039; such as this to heighten security awareness.&nbsp;
