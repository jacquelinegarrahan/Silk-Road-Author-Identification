				This may be a repost, but this is a guide someone had posted<br />in a thread where someone was asking how to get BTC. <br /><br />It helped me and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll help others as well !<br /><br />Guide:<br />________________________________<br /><br /><br /><br />localbitcoins.com does more than just arrange face-to-face transactions between buyers and sellers local to each other.&nbsp; They list all kinds of online offers as well, including Bank Cash Deposit offers, just like BitFloor but with individual sellers with transaction history and ratings and an escrow system, etc.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what I did once BitFloor BitTheDust:<br /><br />1. Go to localbitcoins.com using TorBrowser or Tails.<br /><br />2. Create an account, giving them a tormail.org email address.<br /><br />3. Find a seller accepting cash deposits at a US bank with a branch nearby (I&#039;ve mainly used Bank of America and Chase so far).&nbsp; Many of them are listed here: https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/usd/cash-deposit/ but for whatever reason some of the listings aren&#039;t categorized correctly so make sure to look through all USD online offers here before giving up: https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/usd/<br /><br />4. Press the &quot;Buy&quot; button next to the offer.<br /><br />5. Enter the amount you want to buy in either USD or BTC, leave a note for the seller if you want, and then press &quot;Send Trade Request&quot;<br /><br />6. Take note of the deposit info.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need the bank name, the account number, the state the account is located in (out of state deposits are usually different than in state deposits and require the account state), and sometimes the name of the account holder, although I have been able to deposit without the state and account holder name one time at Chase bank.&nbsp; Each seller is different and will provide the information using different means.&nbsp; Some ask you to text them for it, which is when I cancel the transaction.&nbsp; Others offer it freely in their listing where you can see it before even pressing the buy button.&nbsp; And others include it in the response message you got when you pressed &quot;Send Trade Request&quot;.<br /><br />7. Take note of the localbitcoins.com transaction # so you can write it on the deposit slip somewhere, like: &quot;ref# L41235CXFU&quot;.&nbsp; This helps the seller tell who made which deposit.&nbsp; The account holder can usually see this online wherever deposit slips are viewable at their bank website.<br /><br />8. Go to the bank and deposit the cash.&nbsp; They won&#039;t ask you for ID.&nbsp; You can tell them it&#039;s not your account and you can tell them you don&#039;t know this or that about the account or account holder.&nbsp; At worst they&#039;ll tell you they can&#039;t accept the deposit and you can let the seller know, give them a chance to adjust on their end, or you can cancel the transaction.<br /><br />9. Once the deposit is made, log back into localbitcoins.com and mark the escrow paid so the seller can look for the deposit and release bitcoin into your localbitcoins.com wallet.<br /><br />9. When you see the coin in your localbitcoins.com wallet, transfer to your silkroad wallet.&nbsp; This takes a up to a couple hours depending network on mining/confirmation activity at the time.<br /><br />Some tips:<br /><br />- There is no fee over the amount you request to buy.&nbsp; If you ask for $100 worth of bitcoin, deposit exactly $100 into the bank account.&nbsp; It might be wise to deposit amounts that are not rounded out to make your transaction stand out from others. For example, buy and deposit $101.17 worth of bitcoin so you don&#039;t blend in with everyone else buying round amounts.&nbsp; It&#039;s not uncommon for sellers get 10, 20, 30 or more transactions a day.<br /><br />- The trade rates can vary wildly so be patient and don&#039;t pay too much over market rates.&nbsp; I frequently find rates that higher than market, but still comparable to the premium you pay with bitinstant fees or bitfloor&#039;s inflated USD/BTC rates that I used to pay. <br /><br />- Be careful and don&#039;t trust just any seller.&nbsp; I only use sellers with documented history and that are well rated. <br /><br />- Sometimes I don&#039;t know if the seller will provides enough info for me to be comfortable walking into a bank to deposit cash.&nbsp; For example, if they don&#039;t tell you the account holder name AND they don&#039;t tell you the state the account is in, you might just want to cancel the transaction.&nbsp; I do this now after being rejected once at CitiBank.<br /><br />- This is not truly anonymous since you are walking into a bank, handing cash to a bank teller, probably on camera.&nbsp; But if you were comfortable with BitFloor, or BlueSkyTraders, or even BitInstant, this is pretty much a decentralized version of that with less chance of getting shut down.<br /><br />_____________________________<br /><br /><br />~CHEERS<br />-CAMEL

				Great tutorial, +Karma.<br /><br />I was always under that impression that localbitcoins gave a 403 error when you tried to access it using tor so I never used it but now I will. Thank you.
