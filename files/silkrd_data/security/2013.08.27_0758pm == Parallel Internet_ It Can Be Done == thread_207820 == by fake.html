				Parallel Internet: It Can Be Done<br /><br /><br /><br />Although internet has been controlled mainly by the United States and her allies until this moment, there is a way to overcome this obstacle: convince computer companies to program the TCP/IP in a different manner.<br />It has been done by the Principality of West Antarctic, which is using the first level domain .ant through the Cesidian Root, which resolves the entire ICANN namespace, as well as forty-eight other first level domains.<br />The Cesidian Root is a complete intercontinental Internet which resolves five different roots: the ICANN Root, the Cesidian Root itself, the Chinese Root, the Arab Root and the i-DNS.net Root. Several parallel namespace systems have also been developed in direct contrast to those mentioned above. The reasons for creating these latter are either political or commercial; those used commercially usually have an official, personalized name which describes the domain, such as “.books”.<br />It is rumored that even Google itself is developing an parallel Internet, a rumor which has raised a number of questions among those who dislike the idea of an parallel Internet. Although based mainly on hearsay, an anonymous online editor of the London Times, speaking about “project Googlenet” has been quoted as saying, “Google is ready to launch its own private network, completely managed by its own servers” and that one of their important partners has begun mediation for “furnishing its parallel Internet with original contents provided by the search engine itself.”<br />The Mountain View Company is producing low cost PCs called Google Cube, equipped with everything that is necessary for digital telecommunications, including an open TCP/IP. The sixty-four thousand dollar question is to whom will these computers be sold? The founders of Google refuse to answer the question, saying that they “aren’t authorized to speak regarding projects that haven’t been launched as yet.” It is, however, undeniably true that Google continues to buy up miles of communicative infrastructures – a mass of cables that is being developed from New York and has been described as being in continuous world-wide expansion.<br />It’s a multi-billion dollar business: keep in mind that e-book sales in the USA alone are up to more than 14.4 billion dollars and that the electronic market is over 120 billion dollars. Statistics like these make it easier o understand why Google, or even a small nation such as Antarcticland, are in the running for a piece of the parallel Internet market. Despite the high costs required for maintaining servers capable of managing millions of users and enormous quantities of digital information, parallel Internet is not just a “game” for major-spending groups.<br /><br />paralello internet 2<br /><br />Everyone who surfs the web does so with a twelve digit Mac Address which has been memorized into the computer. Every address is unique and therefore identifiable, and is based on the manufacturer and the progressive product position of the computer itself. This is necessary for both security-related problems as well as the correct function of the TCP/IP, which enables us to surf the web or create a network. The numbers are assigned by the IEEE (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers), while the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), a non-profit organization, is responsible for assigning IPs, managing the system for first level domain names (such as.net, .com, .info, etc.) and Country codes Top Level Domains. If ICANN were to stop controlling and to shut down the servers, no one could surf the net, which would cause serious problems for the world economy.<br />This is why the Principality of West Antarctic is encouraging millions of people to surf the parallel internet by simply changing the TCP/IP number.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />This is how it’s done:<br />1. Click Start, choose CONTROL PANEL.<br />2. Double right-click on CONNECT TO A NETWORK.<br />3. Right click on CONNECTION and choose PROPERTIES. A new window will open.<br />4. Go to the option TCP/IP Protocol, click on PROPERTIES and a new window will open. Insert the DNS addresses (84.200.208.200 and 84.200.212.38) in the appropriate window, selecting the button – use the following DNS –.<br />5. Once you have done this, click OK and then OK to confirm the modification.<br />You will now e able to surf on both traditional Internet as well as the parallel internet through the Cesidian root.

				I would not recommend this.<br /><br />Those DNS servers will be able to log your IP address and every domain name you ever resolve, so you&#039;re leaking data to an unknown third party who is outside your country and who you have no contract with. <br />
