				This is a short but sweet step-by-step guide I wrote for another SR user to accompany the pictorial guide on downloading the necessary programs to run PGP on a Mac.&nbsp; The steps work with Firefox 5.0, 4.0 and earlier:<br /><br />The program installation tutorial and download is at: http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/II/gpgmacfield.html&nbsp; &nbsp;Written by fellow SR user &quot;goddamn&quot; if I recall correctly.<br /><br />Download the referenced free MACGPG2 program and go through the first two parts of the tutorial: Installation and Key Generation<br /><br />Ignore the third part: Message Encryption Operations-you cannot use the &quot;GPG Drop Thing&quot; to encrypt/decrypt messages.&nbsp; It&#039;s because you have no way to associate the message with a specific persons public key...that has to be done with a mail program...AFAIK<br />This will make sense when you get to this point.<br /><br />To encrypt a message, you will need to open your mail program on Mac, type your message in a &quot;new message&quot; THEN (very important) select the whole message, then go MAIL--&gt;SERVICES--&gt;OPEN PGP:ENCRYPT&nbsp; &nbsp;If you only type the message but don&#039;t select/highlight all of it, the necessary function selections will not show up under the SERVICES menu and you will be completely flummoxed and think you are a retarded asswipe...just like I did!!!&nbsp; I nearly went crazy looking for a function I *fucking knew* must exist there, but didn&#039;t show up at all.<br /><br />You have to use your mail program for *importing other people&#039;s keys* as well.&nbsp; Just clipboard their key from the source, put it in a new message (you don&#039;t have to put a recipient or anything else, just use a blank message, like in the above example) then go to: MAIL--&gt;SERVICES--&gt;OPEN PGP:IMPORT KEY&nbsp; and it will go directly to your keychain, which is a program in your applications file and you can open it and see whose keys you have already and whose you don&#039;t.&nbsp; When you finish Installation, it will be empty; when you finish Key Encryption, it will have just your own key in it.&nbsp; Then you add other people&#039;s keys from there.<br /><br />BIG WARNING: use a totally fake name and email when it asks for your name and email during Key Generation.&nbsp; That name and email goes to everyone who imports your public key...so I am joeblow2@noplacelikehome.com<br /><br />GOOD LUCK!!!&nbsp; :)

				&nbsp;I use GPGTools for Mac and I am able to encrypt messages to sellers directly from within the Silk Road site: type message, select all text, right-click --&gt; Services --&gt; Open PGP: Encrypt.&nbsp; Then I can choose whose public key to use for the encryption.&nbsp; (Of course, you have to import the seller&#039;s public key into GPGTools before you can select it for encryption.)

				I had the same problem when I first used it.&nbsp; Try typing a test message on TextEdit and select &#039;make plain text&#039; under format.&nbsp; That worked for me.&nbsp; It looks like you and do the same thing in your message box in SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will say though, that it was really annoying trying to figure this out.&nbsp; I might be in the dark on this one, but, you would think that there would be a simple straight forward GPG program with a central interface.&nbsp; But, once you figure it out, GPG services isn&#039;t too bad.

				I use Google Chrome.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had to go outside the browser to encrypt messages, but I have to copy and paste encrypted responses into TextEdit in order to decrypt them.&nbsp; If anyone knows of a way to decrypt messages from within a browser, please feel free to share your knowledge here.

				Hi. I&#039;m trying to get it to work for the first time. I copy and pasted the seller&#039;s key onto a message, and successfully imported the key into the GPG key chain access (seller&#039;s name appears). I typed out the message I want to send, highlighted the whole message, and went to MAIL--&gt;SERVICES--&gt;OPEN PGP:ENCRYPT and selected the seller&#039;s key from the list, but nothing happened. Where does the encrypted message appear? Thanks.

				@joeblow - I just got it to work I think. It wouldn&#039;t work in mail, so I tried the text editor. When you right click in text edit, there is a services option and you can encrypt from there. I&#039;m not 100% sure I got it to work, but it looks right.

				Hi. I have installed GPGTools (gpgtools.com) as well as tried the method through the tutorial you listed of just installing MacGPG2 and manually creating a key and such. When i go to encrypt things though, the option is never available in the services menu. When i type a message in my mail app or in textEdit and select all, there is no OpenGPG: encrypt option in the services menu. However, when i select a file or something like that on my computer, the OpenGPG options DO appear in the services menu. However, encrypting a file does not work for sending a message via silk road and such, so this presents an issue. I have made sure the OpenGPG options are checked in the Services Preferences and i have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times. Any thoughts as to why this might be happening or how i can fix it?

				Are you highlighting the text in the text editor before you right click? GPG won&#039;t appear in the services menu unless the text you want to encrypt is highlighted.

				Everytime I think I know about computers I discover I still have lots to learn.&nbsp; I have GPGtools installed on my mac, but I suspect that the fact that I&#039;m running Lion is a bit of a problem.&nbsp; The only place I get the services menu is in finder and that creates a .gpg file that TextEdit refuses to open.&nbsp; No services menu in FF or Chrome though.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure out how to get on SILC on my macbook either.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m going to pm you btcfreedom, hopefully you can help.

That might be the problem.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i am using 10.7 too, and what they mean is the mailbundle that is supposed to integrate into Mail is not compatible.<br /><br />Do not waste your time with Apple Mail.<br /><br />download gedit to compose and cut/paste your keys/messages.<br /><br />use gedit&#039;s saved format (windows,linux/unix for mac...etc) to import and export keys, decrypt in the terminal, etc.<br /><br />eg&gt;<br /><br />gpg -d (drag and drop the file right onto the terminal) and hit return. you&#039;ll be prompted (if PGP is working correctly) to enter your passphrase which is your signed key to the person&#039;s encrypted message. once you enter the password, it will tell you the type of encryption it is and decrypt. NOTE: in most instances- if you do not have the person&#039;s public key imported into your gpg keying, you will NOT be able to decrypt.<br /><br />Before decryption I do this: 1. Import the person&#039;s PUBLIC key and paste into gedit, save - import via GPGKeychain. 2. Go into the terminal and verify this has been imprted with gpg --list-keys.<br /><br />So, in essence, it&#039;s a combination of the GPGServices, which are right-clickable, and do work with Growl notifcation; straight xcode GUI (GPGKeychain, and GPG Prefpane), and of course Terminal. It&#039;s good for you.<br /><br /><br />L75

RTF is Mac OS text editor default which I think is gay.<br /><br />moving forward, with gedit:<br /><br />once you&#039;ve saved that document, right click and apply your said services. You can do it all with gedit+gpgTools I&#039;ve figured out now, no Terminal.<br /><br />i have successfully encrypted, decrypted, validated, imported, and signed keys / messages.<br /><br />here to help all Mac OS users.

				If you&#039;re using Leopard or Snow Leopard, use GPGTools and the Mac Mail plugin.<br /><br />If you&#039;re using Lion, use GPGTools and Thunderbird + Enigma plugin <br /><br />If all else fails, use Wija or a Windows VM.&nbsp; <br /><br />For more possibilities, check here: http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/frontends.html

Thunderbird is good, so is Enigma. I just choose not to use.<br /><br />The more you use a GUI the more logging you&#039;ll get - with the terminal and a custom build you can eliminate this.<br /><br />Windows VM and / or Linux VM are great....Make either one live and / or tails trucrypt and you&#039;re golden.<br /><br />L75

				I have an issue and hoped someone could help. I have GPG Keychain access. I&#039;ve imported the the public key of the person that I want to send a PM on SR.&nbsp; However this is what happens when I try to encrypt something in a window like this or the SR PM:<br /><br />No problem highlighting text<br />No problem selecting OpenPGP:Encrypt in Services.<br />Problem when trying to pick the public key that I want to use to encrypt my message/text. The window that says &quot;choose recipients&quot; is totally blank. In fact, not even my private key is shown for the option to sign. <br /><br />Any thoughts on what the problem is? Any way to make sure all the info/keys gets added to the recipients window?<br /><br />THANKS<br />&nbsp;
