				If you came here because of my post on the other thread I was actually talking about this document: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13219<br /><br />Although that one certainly isn&#039;t as relaxing or easy :-P (or helpful either now that I think about it).

				QTC is always trying to scare us with scary stories of the Man and his Machine, never let him read to you at bedtime haha :)<br /><br />But seriously, great stuff&nbsp; :D

				Back to seriousness :-P I think the end of this document has some good stuff for the other thread about permeation.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The vapor concentration [of heroin] at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 ppt.&nbsp; This is the lowest value of all the drugs discussed in this appendix, making heroin an extremely difficult molecule to detect from its vapor.&nbsp; In virtually all applications, collection of particulate contamination is necessary to successfully utilize trace detection.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The vapor concentration at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is about 0.25 ppb, or approximately 250 times higher than that of heroin (fig. 1).&nbsp; This vapor pressure means that vapor detection of cocaine is possible in some circumstances, but collection of particle contamination is still highly desirable to maximize the probability of detection.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The equilibrium vapor concentration of THC in air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is about 61 ppt, making this chemical about 60 times more vaporous than heroin but 4 times less vaporous than cocaine.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The saturated vapor concentration of methamphetamine at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is approximately 214 ppm, making this by far the most vaporous of the illicit drugs considered in this study.&nbsp; In principle, this means that vapor detection of this drug should be relatively straightforward, but particle detection might be difficult due to the tendency of particles to evaporate rapidly.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[LSD&#039;s] saturated vapor concentration at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is approximately 1.2 ppt.&nbsp; This extremely low value, similar to that of heroin, means that it is difficult or impossible to detect from its vapor in many circumstances and that trace detection needs to be focused on particle collection.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So this confirms the idea we&#039;ve been tossing around there, that cleaning your vacuum sealed pack between additional isolating procedures is more important than vacuum sealing in the first place. (And some things, like acid, aren&#039;t worth vacuum packing but we already knew that.)
