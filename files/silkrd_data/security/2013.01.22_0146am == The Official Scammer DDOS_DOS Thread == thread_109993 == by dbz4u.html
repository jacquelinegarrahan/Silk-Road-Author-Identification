				Tess&#039;s topic for donations, he had brought bitcoin talks down last night with slowloris, it was just him running the attack. They are currently up.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109831.0<br /><br />The original scammer ddos thread<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109654.0<br /><br />Security members, we need you. We have all seen the spam, we have all wished them pain. Today is your chance, nay OUR chance to hit back. Any methods or strategies that you can carry out yourselves, do so, but make sure you are protected behind a wall of anonymity. Any methods or strategies that we should discuss, post them here. They have annoyed us, but much more importantly they have stolen our members money. This is beyond unacceptable. They are currently paying members to spam for them. This will never end unless we make it.<br /><br />Yes our mods now have power to ban accounts. But they are still coming, like the Persian horde in 300. But members, realize it is not just us getting scammed. This is the bitcoin community. I urge you, if you have the power to do something about this, PLEASE DO!

				They have websites on the clearnet, they use paypal and so on. There must be a method by which we can unmask their true identities.
