				Ladies and Gentlemen of Silk Road Forums:<br /><br />Let&#039;s kill &#039;em with kindness.<br /><br />Saying things like &quot;fuck you pig piece of shit,&quot; will not help the cause of ending prohibition (I&#039;m aware of the &quot;If Prohibition ended&quot; thread and argument started by the great DPR, but let&#039;s no go there here).<br /><br />I would like encourage everyone to try to have a tone of respect for LEO.&nbsp; This will be much more effective than counter-productive angst and hatred.&nbsp; All that does is piss them off and fuel their fire.<br /><br />One way we can do this is PsyOps.&nbsp; These PsyOps do not need to be secret because we are on the side of reason and logic.&nbsp; I dare say that most of the LEO&#039;s do have reason and are not blind, nor stupid.&nbsp; Especially the ones that are on the task force to shut down Silk Road.&nbsp; For the ones on, let&#039;s just call it, &quot;Operation Road Block,&quot; (they probably have something more clever named) will have an even higher level of intelligence simply due to the technical know-how needed to even think about taking this down.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many LEO&#039;s already have a tinge of doubt about the WOD, let&#039;s help that &quot;tinge of doubt&quot; grow into conscious thought.<br /><br />I would like to suggest that you put a link, as I have done, in your signature to www.leap.cc.<br /><br />LEAP is no joke and there are serious players on there.&nbsp; Majority of LEO&#039;s don&#039;t even know it exists.&nbsp; LEAP is also international.<br /><br />So, simply put a link to LEAP on your signature, and lets get the word out to LE that the &quot;WOD&quot; is not helping, but actually harming those whom they are sworn to serve.<br /><br />Cheers and thanks for considering this.<br /><br />Chuck.

				The problem is that cops are groupers. They are collectivists that like to be part of organizations and let others think for them.<br /><br />SR users (the non-LE ones) are individuals.

Many LE will have to come to their senses. We just have reality on our side, and there&#039;s only so long you can deny reality until it starts to fuck you in the face (take note Mister Dank.. next time you&#039;re deepthroating your dealers dick-cheese laden cock have a good hard think about that one).<br /><br />But I mean, surely any police reading this, are bound to eventually say.. hold up.. all these people are buying drugs, taking them, and harming noone, and nothing else happens. Like you might have a beer after work with your taskforce buddies. It&#039;s just the fucking reality of it and no matter how many cocksuck arguments they come up with about drugs being amoral or ruining society, common sense must prevail in the end.

				Ayn Rand wrote a piece for the Objectivist newsletter once called, &quot;The Inexplicable Personal Alchemy.&quot; Collectivists are still humans and have the capacity for reason, but she thought that the majority of people were just inclined to be collectivists and those moral alchemists were the rare few with genuine human integrity, a very pessimistic outlook. But I think anyone can be persuaded if you appeal to his or her capacity for reason, because when someone is confronted with truth and they disagree with it, they are only lying to themselves. Remarkably people have a strong capacity to self delude, cognitive bias, whatever, but if you have the strength to try you can eventually get anyone to agree with you if you show them why you yourself see whatever it is as right. Unless you turn out to be wrong, and you are the one guilty of self delusion. I think that most people here have rightful principled attitudes about drugs though, we just need the strength to show the world. Or we need to keep it on the down low so this operation doesn&#039;t get wrecked and then we can get away with having our principles and getting high too. <br /><br />I just have to add that at the end of the day there is no right or wrong. The difference between experiencing self delusion and self hatred, or experiencing righteous conviction and pride, the difference between being high all day and affirming your life, or living it out in a prison cell, its really just aesthetic. Still it doesn&#039;t mean we shouldn&#039;t try. At least that&#039;s what I think.

				WOD...<br />Ah, War on Drugs, I spent a minute trying to figure out why we were talking them out of crossfit. :p&nbsp; <br /><br />Killing them with kindness is not an effective euthanasia strategy.&nbsp; <br />I also don&#039;t think it will win them over en masse.&nbsp; LEO has/have a lot to gain by busting SR users/vendors/management, independent of upholding the law.<br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be any more effective than killing scammers with kindness. (&quot;We&#039;re swell people! Don&#039;t scam us! We&#039;re all in this together! Viva la revolucion! Liberte, egalite, fraternite, MDMA!&quot; = not going to work to stop scammers.&nbsp; Why would this be different?)<br /><br />There are two major categories of LE that would be here, it seems to my green-bunny self.<br />Undercover officers/UCOs, and LEO lurkers (analysts, intel gatherers). Who am I leaving out? (Ha: speak up! Don&#039;t be shy.)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know who&#039;s a UCO. But I have known some outstanding swindlers and cons.&nbsp; <br />Burn this into your brain: Anyone who&#039;s working as a undercover anything, whether s/he is a UCO or a scammer, is carefully, deliberately building a relationship with the intent to betray you.<br />You and I and every non-LEO here are prey in that situation. <br />And even if s/he does regret betraying you at the time?<br />It doesn&#039;t matter. They do it anyway, and then they get over it.<br /><br />If you are trying to kill them with kindness, to be a nice mouse for that kitty, you will only give them more fodder for building rapport, and it will create more cognitive dissonance for you. This can make it difficult for you to maintain your boundaries and wariness and will leave you more trusting and less likely to say, &quot;Lawyer, now,&quot; and &quot;I do not consent to this search,&quot; if or when the time comes. <br /><br />Anyway. In order to maintain some level of sanity, I suspect that a UCO has to have a degree of &#039;true believer syndrome&#039; and has to be on-mission enough to not be swayed by something as simple as a LEAP link.&nbsp; In addition, this is a milieu in which all interactions can be audited - everything is transcribed - and so I wonder if it is maybe particularly easy to monitor for someone&#039;s &#039;break.&#039; If a UCO shows signs of actually wavering, s/he is probably out the door. Not too hard to swap out a nym.&nbsp; (They do have a big advantage for undercover work here; they can have more than one person working under a given nym, as long as they are thorough in checking out to each other in report and maintain the information base.)<br /><br />Basically -- I don&#039;t think you or I can out psyops them. At least I know /I/ can&#039;t. <br />Anyone who&#039;s working this in a full-on psyops mode is probably, y&#039;know, pretty fucking good, at least as good as &quot;Tony&quot; and his many nyms were/are/whatever. <br />Thinking out loud here, the skill set for a career scammer and a UCO seems similar, so, if I were LEO mgmt, I&#039;d try to turn the high-skills/career scammers, the patient ones, and at least get them to train the UCOs. That&#039;s on the paranoid side, so I&#039;ll stop.<br /><br />Unless you are talking about psyops in the sense of setting up slow corrosive guilt, in the manner of my grandmother? In which case, not efficient, and if they were going to go there, they would have already.<br /><br />Being kind and polite is nice for the media. It may do something to strengthen PR. Who knows what it does for prosecution. I have no idea if SR posts have been used at all. I hate that the arrests/paranoia thread went away, because there are no transcripts to pull and there&#039;s no way to see how SR information was used or not used in trials. <br /><br />Still, I am all in favor of exposing people to LEAP. Why?<br />Because 1) see &#039;naivete&#039; and you will see a cross-ref to me; 2) someone or other will read about it and join up, even if it&#039;s some random LEO who&#039;s here for personal use or just looking around, or some junior prosecutor or analyst. (Or one of the many journalists around here will call LEAP for an interview.) People are pack animals. The existence of something like LEAP validates their own belief and strengthens their resolve. So, sure.<br />Can&#039;t hurt, I guess. One at a time.<br /><br />

				I gotta agree, who cares what the pigs think about SR?&nbsp; They don&#039;t make the laws, and the &quot;but look how nice we are&quot; defense isn&#039;t gonna hold up in a drug trafficking case.<br /><br />The only time I&#039;ve ever been polite to the cops is getting pulled over with a bunch of yayo in the trunk.&nbsp; We&#039;re anonymous here, this is one of the few places we can safely vent our secret desire to have LEO lined up and shot&nbsp; :)

				while I agree wholeheartedly with the gist of the OP, it&#039;s unfortunate that no matter how you cut it, &quot;question policy&quot; is not in LE&#039;s vocabulary, as opposed to the word &quot;doughnut.&quot; <br /><br />LE follows the chain of command, and at the top of that command you have people like chuck shroomer [sic]. Odds are, Shroomer&#039;s point of view is probably just some bullshit he doesn&#039;t really even believe, but expresses anyways because it conveniently fits into his agenda, most of which probably revolves around the acquisition of money and votes. <br /><br />In turn, LE management have been trained to gobble up loads of hot steaming MIND TURDS directly from the assholes of the political elite... again, for money and prestige. So there&#039;s fucking shit allllll over the place.<br /><br />Until the day LEOs focus their energy SOLELY on pedos and violent crime, all i really have to say to them is:<br /><br />GO EAT A DOUGHNUT, SHIT BREATH.&nbsp; ;)

				How about a counter message to LE.<br /><br />&quot;You and your masters declared war. Now you are growing tired and are on your last wind. You may even be having doubts about starting this. Sucks to be you though.. cause having declared the war.. we aren&#039;t going to let you be the ones to declare peace. You&#039;ve killed too many of us, thrown too many of us in cages to die, broken too many of our families.<br /><br />&nbsp;You don&#039;t get to declare victory and go home. Cause there is no home for you, not while your victims still exist. The Shoah didn&#039;t end till the last Nazi monster was dead and in hell, and this won&#039;t either. <br />&nbsp; Sooner or later.. you&#039;re going to get yours.. and everyone you value in this world will look back on your deeds with revulsion.<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s just a matter of time. Whether it&#039;s the garrotte, the handcuffs, the gascan and lighter, the bullet, a formal tribunal, or simply a young hand pulling the plug on your respirator in the old folks home.. <br /><br />&nbsp;The drug war ends when you have been tried for your crimes against humanity, or when you are dead and in hell, or we are. And there&#039;s ALOT more of us than you. Welcome to something called &quot;consequences&quot;. Have a nice day&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;I think this is a much better statement don&#039;t y&#039;all?

				I watched The Untouchables recently which takes place during the alcohol prohibition era in the 1930&#039;s (wonderful Scorsese flick btw, go and watch it if you haven&#039;t yet). <br /><br />This discussion (sans the whole Dank bashing) reminds me of the end of the film, when a reporter informs the cop who had just brought Al Capone behind bars, that there are plans to repeal prohibition and asks what he would do then.

I think our only hope is to have a greater influence on shaping the zeitgeist than do the politicians, lobbies, and special interests. Once people understand what a scam the WOD is, EN MASS, there will no longer be a need for it. The hard part is coming up with a long-term strategy, the money to support that strategy, and the patience to wait it out.<br /><br />Until then, places like SR will be our loophole to the future. I&#039;m going to live NOW as we all will live in 100-200 years, a time when the concept that people can do whatever they want with themselves is common sense, assuming someone doesn&#039;t totally fuck up our social/political evolution. They will look back in awe at how fucked up our system was.

				As the last time I posted this it got deleted, ill post it again...<br /><br />THE POLICE<br /><br />The ones who beat Rodney King, who gunned down Sean Bell and Amadou Diallo and Oscar Grant, who murdered Fred Hampton in his bed. The ones who broke Víctor Jara’s hands and Steve Biko’s skull, who disappeared dissidents from Argentina to Zaire, who served Josef Stalin. The ones who enforced Apartheid in South Africa and segregation in the United States. The ones who interrogated Black Panthers and Catholic Workers, who maintained records on 16 million people in East Germany, who track us through surveillance cameras and phone taps. The ones firing tear gas and rubber bullets whenever a demonstration gets out of hand, who back the bosses in every strike. The ones who stand between every hungry person and the grocery shelves stocked with food, between every homeless person and the buildings standing empty, between every immigrant and her family.<br /><br />In every nation, in every age, you tell us you’re indispensable, that without you we’d all be killing each other. But we know well enough who the killers are. <br /><br />You won’t fuck with us much longer.
