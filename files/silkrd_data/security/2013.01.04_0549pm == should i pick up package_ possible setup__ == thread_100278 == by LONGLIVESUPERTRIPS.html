				Standard method 1:<br /><br />You should get someone who is unconnected to anything to do with you to pick it up.<br /><br />You might have to end up paying some lowlife off the street to pick it up. Perhaps look for someone who would welcome a warm cell for the night and breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />They might not be 100% honest though and try to run off with your package if it is not a CD.<br /><br />So you need to monitor the pickup remotely in like a car or van. You will need a gun or sniper rifle to shoot them if they try to run with your shit. And a gundog that is trained to fetch so that you do not have to leave your cover when you gun that bastard down.<br /><br />Hope this all goes to plan for you.<br /><br />OR:<br />method2:<br /><br />Go in as yourself, but have a bomb strapped to your torso.<br />If the police try to come and arrest you, just open up your coat and show them the explosives.<br />Tell that that you will blow yourself, them and the fucking loot to kingdom come if you are not allowed to walk away as a free man. (dress as a clown or something or they might get you on cctv and come looking)

				Have you contacted the vendor about it?<br />What did they say?<br />You said they leave a key for a bigger box...as in they mail you a key to your p.o. box then ship the actual product to a different box which you go pick up?<br />Is it possible they didn&#039;t mail the key this time and simply mailed the product to the address you gave them?<br />If you&#039;re that sketched out, wait a few days and re-evaluate...or pay a homeless person to go get it for you...unless they require id then...well...

				If the feds are waiting them and you have a lot of money worth of drugs in the package you may be fucked.<br /><br />If the drugs worth less than a million dollars and you are not involved in gang crime then it&#039;s cool dude.<br /><br />Just slip the fbi man a 20 dollar note and he will be your freind.<br /><br />Just put the dollars into his shirt pocket and say &quot;whoa dude look, you got $20 in your pocket, how did that get in there.&quot;<br /><br />He may just take a joints worth from you if you have loads. <br />If you only have a little bit of weed or coke then he will feel sorry for you coz you not got many drugs.

				Go to the front desk with the card and ask for your package. They are not going to stake it out 24/7 they do not have the manpower. Think about it, if the dealer sent a key they would put it in the box. A large package they leave a note like that. If they try to stall you, say you have to make a call, and then walk off. I assume you have spoken with your dealer about it?

As well as the quantity of drugs. They may be monitoring and ready to pounce on you!<br /><br />SAFETY WARNING:<br />If they (staff) try to stall you instead of just handing over the package straight away, then it is likely because the police are on the way. (they might only be seconds away).

				Do you know how long it took the vendor to ship it to you and make it there? Because if it was bud maybe they can smell it now and that would be really bad for you, but if its something else like blotters, i think you would be fine.<br /><br />But then, what drugs did you order?

				I would take the card to the front desk. If they give you the parcel or if there is postage to pay on it do that. If they want you to sign for it say that it isn&#039;t your parcel, refuse to sign and walk out.

				Its normal that they have stuff behind the desk for you. The lockers get filled up then they have to give out pink slips. If the slip has a phone number to call that is a set up.
