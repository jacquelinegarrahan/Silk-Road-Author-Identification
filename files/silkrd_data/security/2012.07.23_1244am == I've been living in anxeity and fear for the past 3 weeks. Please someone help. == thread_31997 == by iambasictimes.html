				So basically what happened:<br /><br />I bought bitcoins through bitinstant --&gt; mtgox via MoneyGram. I went to my local store and did it and paid with a debit card (I know, I&#039;m an idiot).<br /><br />I then transfered said bitcoins to my wallet on my PC, and then to my SR address. Bought something, and that was the end of that.<br /><br />I then (week or so later), did the exact the same thing. Bit instant --&gt; mtgox, but this time I paid in cash, which I had just got from my ATM through the same Debit card. These bitcoins are currently unspent and sitting in my SR account.<br /><br />What I&#039;m freaking out about is getting caught. I recieved my order and all was good, its not even in my possession anymore (it was for a friend). But I bought from a reputable source and I didnt encrypt my address or our messages. <br /><br />Am I at risk of being caught? I&#039;ve been unable to sleep for the past week or so and I&#039;ve thrown up almost every day. I was unable to enjoy my vacation.<br /><br />Please give me some insight. <br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I was very naive at the beggining, didn&#039;t know what I was doing.<br /><br />So is there a risk? Should I be concerned?<br />I know that if I ever ordered again (I only have once) I&#039;d do it with much more security.<br /><br />Also if it helps things, all the orders and bitcoins, ect, was made on my network at home, but mailed to another house (the recieving freind).<br /><br />Would that be able to help me if anything were to happen?

				First of all, I think you will be fine.<br />The address you sent your coins to (the sr wallet) is not known to belong to sr as long as sr is not compromised.<br />If they happen to find the sr servers now and they find the guy you bought from and he doesnt delete his messages, maybe you could be in trouble. but even then...doesnt sound like you bought a few kg ;)<br />This is a very very very unlikely scenario....<br /><br />-you are low profile<br />-you dont even have the drugs anymore<br />-sr is not compromised<br />-youll be fine<br /><br />If they knew you would receive that package, they wouldnt wait. theyd wait for your mailman and then raid your home. didnt happen.<br />and for you to convict you of buying drugs like i said, theyd have to get a hold of the sr servers and your message would have to still be there and theyd have to link your payment to sr which might also not be possible because of sr&#039;s mixer.<br /><br /><br />all in all i think its safe to say that the friend you gave the drugs to is a higher security risk ;)<br /><br /><br />I dont know how many things you have bought, but if youre paranoid you might consider creating a new sr account (switch id first ;) ) and transfer your funds from your current sr account through an instawallet to the new one.
