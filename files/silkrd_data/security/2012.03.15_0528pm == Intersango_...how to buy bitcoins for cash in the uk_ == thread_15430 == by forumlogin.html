				Hi Mate <br />All you have to do is go is log on to intersango&nbsp; website,&nbsp; go into the accounts then the British pounds . In there you see the instructions, you don’t need to open up any account in the bank just pay into account details provided by intersango. (Ps don’t forget to put the ref details down on your paying in slip.) <br />Hope this helps mate<br />

				I recently made an account with Intersango and have done a couple of cash deposits. The first one worked smoothly, was in my account within hours. The second one, last week, took a while and I opened a support ticket. After a while they put the money in and said it was Lloyds fault. Either way I got my money so all fine :)<br /><br />Re: the name. I&#039;m not sure which is best. I used a made up, random email address but can&#039;t remember what I put as the name and I can&#039;t find it on my Intersango page. Either way I&#039;ll probably rotate accounts used anyway, all with fake email addresses.<br /><br />But, yeah, Intersango works ok - most of the time :) I think if you&#039;re concerned just try depositing a small amount first.<br /><br />

				Intersango are working ok again now, I made a cash deposit last week and it arrived within 24 hours.<br />Use a fake name, you need access to the email address that you give them though.

				So you just walk in to a bank (must it be a lloyds branch?) and they&#039;ll do a wire transfer without asking for your own account etc? What&#039;s the technical term for it so I don&#039;t seem like a retard?

				Yeah, it has to be a Lloyds but it can be any branch. If you do bank with Lloyds I&#039;d recommending using a branch that won&#039;t recognize you, but that&#039;s up to you :)<br /><br />No, they won&#039;t ask you any personal information - well, they shouldn&#039;t, and can&#039;t by law force you to make polite chit chat with them. If you&#039;re that worried about personal chit chat just pretend you&#039;re on the phone or something.<br /><br />And just fill in the paying in slip (all self explanatory) and then hand it to the cashier with the amount and they&#039;ll do their thing. Don&#039;t forget your reference!

				I just got some BTC from Mt Gox. Paid cash in at about half four on Tuesday, got the BTC about an hour ago (02:30 22/03/2012)<br />Plus their account is with Barclays, who have branches everywhere! Takes a while, but they always take the same amount of time, and they don&#039;t switch accounts all the time like Intersango.

				I&#039;ve used them twice.&nbsp; The first time I went into my local Loyds, and the money showed up a couple of hours later!<br /><br />Then I read on here about Loyds accounts being dodgy. That one of their Directors had done a bunk and he was the only one with access to their Loyds account!&nbsp; <br /><br />This concerned me, and having no Metro bank near by, I used Ukash vouchers. They worked fine!!<br /><br />Seeing as all vendors demand you finalise early, What good are bit coins?&nbsp; You are not guaranteed your money back with bitcoins finalizing early. <br /><br />And if you don&#039;t finalise early , no one will do business with you!!<br /><br />I stupidly travelled to London to the main Metro bank, I paid my money in and 3 days later it is not in my Intersango account!!<br /><br />They have no customer service, I got 1 reply from about 7 emails. <br /><br />FUCK INTERSANGO AND FUCK BITCOIN<br /><br />OH JUST FUCK IT :&#039;(

				I used to be a advocate of Intersangos but have had a similar issue over the last week. I paid a small ammount of money into&nbsp; Metro bank for the first time and have been waiting for almost one week now. Many emails later I have had no joy. On their site I used the Metro bank due to it stating that Lloyds was slow and the former faster. I am really starting to get annoyed now too! Will now try and Skype with Patrick.

				Got my btc in 4 working days from Intersango!! <br />Unfortunately my vendor was out of product by then!<br />Got to wait at least another week.<br />Oh well, least I saved some money.<br />I have a feeling either they don&#039;t have enough bitcoin to give out, or they just want to sit on your money for a week. Then sort out the bitcoins when the market is more favourable to them.<br />Typical bankers!!<br />As to paying money from your bank to their Metro Account.<br />That would work fine, as long as you don&#039;t mind leaving a trail buy bitcoins and loosing your annonimity!<br />

				Just a heads up: Was talking to Patrick the other day chasing something up and he was telling me that they are going to stop allowing Metro bank cash deposits soon. Something about unreliability...so it would only be BACs transfer.<br /><br />Would be pretty weak and given how often their depositing routes/methods change I wonder if it actually will come into play.

				Hi All,<br /><br />Completely new to all of this. Paid some money into Intersango on thurs/fri is showing on my Intersango account but at what point does this get transferred into Bitcoins or is that what you are all waiting&nbsp; for within this thread? Sorry all, total Noob to his system.<br />&nbsp;Also how do you get the bitcoins, or cash balance onto SR? I know on SR they give an address to send them to but where is this facility on Intersango? <br />&nbsp;To be fair after reading this thread i probably won&#039;t use them again but still need to clear my account with them as it is at the moment.<br />&nbsp; Sorry if this question has been answered in previous threads/stickies.<br /><br />Any help greatly appreciated<br />Rgds<br />Sleeps<br />

				Hello,<br />Iv used the lloyds method a few times, only once had a problem, emailed intersango and they were prompt with reply and sorted out the issue next day. Are they really stopping using them, this would be a nightmare, im nervous about using the other bank after the hack last year.

				So now it looks like cash transfers are out of the picture with intersango - does anyone know of any similar methods to buy bitcoins in the UK using cash? This is evidently the most anonymous approach to buying bitcoins.

				I was just about to head to my local Lloyds branch before I found this thread. Glad I read it first.<br /><br />What&#039;s the next best way for a newbie to turn this £20 note in his wallet into bitcoins then? <br /><br />Thanks

				hi guys im new to this and think i now know what i have to do after abit of confusion,could someone clarify if im right before i go ahead and do it. im assuming the mtgox site still accepts cash deposits,so i sign up for an account on there,get the bank details they give you on there and get a cash deposit slip from barcleys,fill out the bank details from mtgox on the slip then pay in some money (and i dont need to bank with barcleys??) then will it just appear in my mtgox account when it clears?&nbsp; may the bankers ask me questions about where im depositing my money?<br /><br />all help will be much appriciated

They won&#039;t ask any questions beyond what&#039;s necessary to put the money in the account. You should bear in mind that this method isn&#039;t entirely anonymous as you&#039;ll be on CCTV and they might remember your face - it&#039;s better to fill in a deposit slip in your own time and put it in one of those special deposit envelope; most banks have a box in branch where you can leave the envelope.<br /><br />V.

				Hi Skunkjunkie,<br /><br />If you try to access MtGox using Tor then your account may be frozen. Ideally you need another way to use the internet anonymously. You can do this through a process known as secure shell tunneling, for more information see this excellent Wiki article:<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol<br /><br />My particular tunnel of choice can be found at http://tunnel.shellmix.com&nbsp; -you&#039;ll see there&#039;s a tutorial there on creating an account with them and also one on how to install the program &#039;Putty&#039; and configure it with Firefox to get going. Once again any snags, let me know.<br /><br />You should bear in mind this isn&#039;t quite as anonymous as Tor but in all fairness it doesn&#039;t really need to be as the Bitcoins themselves will provide you with another layer of secrecy once you withdraw them from your Bitcoin account. If you&#039;re feeling extra paranoid you can always run your coins through a mixing service like Bitcoinfog.<br /><br />Personally I access MtGox from my work PC without making any efforts to hide my anonymity - part of my investment portfolio is in Bitcoins and there&#039;s no reason to hide this fact.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15430.msg184273#msg184273">Quote from: skunkjunkie on April 10, 2012, 11:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">is shellmix the tunnel? forgive me,im ok with computers but ive not done stuff like this before.once i have set it up will it let me on mt gox with tor? is there anything i should know before trying to set it up?<br /><br />cheers<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Just fill the deposit slip in with the account details from Mt.

				Is it possible for someone to post an easy step by step tutorial regarding shellmix and putty? For the non tech savvy the instructions at the site are so unclear as to be impenetrable! Like a lot of people I have been tripped up by Intersangos change of policy and I would like to try MtGox via Barclays. I don&#039;t understand what details you need from the MtGox server to enable this. This is all as clear as mud, I hope someone can help. Thanks.

You&#039;ll see the details for the Barclay&#039;s bank account with a reference number unique to your MtGox account. You can deposit cash over the counter obviously but make sure they get the reference number right so they know to credit it to your particular account.<br /><br />Next week I plan to start a service here in the UK offering Bitcoins in exchange for cash in the mail which offers a much higher degree of privacy. I can&#039;t offer to do this on here until I&#039;m set up with a seller account but if you&#039;d like more information, feel free to send me a message.<br /><br />V.

				Thanks very much for that, it looks really helpful, cheers.<br /><br />Well, it was helpful in completing the configuration, but I still don&#039;t know if it &#039;took&#039; on firefox. I entered the numbers but it keeps going back to &#039;no proxy&#039;. Has the manual configuration failed for firefox?<br />Beyond that I still have no clue how you are supposed to use this thing to securely surf the net in the manner of Tor. Do I have to enter details of the MtGox server? What is the procedure for using it? Unfortunately, once you get to a certain stage all the text reverts to Polish. I do hope someone can help with this, ta.

				Majorly pissed that Intersango closed their Lloyds account. I never had any problems that couldn&#039;t be solved through a quick chat with a member of Intersango&#039;s support team on IRC. I don&#039;t fancy paying the train fare to London every time I want to deposit money into metro bank (Which is no longer possible actually), and I don&#039;t want to use a wire transfer.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be paying money into MtGox through deposit sometime soon, I&#039;ll update when I know a little more

				Why don&#039;t they open another account with a more reliable bank? Or have LE been leaning on them re anonymous deposits, anyone heard?

				I imagine they&#039;re looking into it - they must have lost a huge amount of business due to it.<br /><br />For the time being check out Mtgox if you are in the UK. You can cash deposit at a Barclay&#039;s branch and it&#039;ll appear in your Mtgox account. The only downside is not being able to access it through TOR, but with proper BTC practices this shouldn&#039;t be too much of an issue.<br /><br />

				Paid my weed money into Barclays today, but have to wait &#039;1 to 3 business days&#039; for it to appear in my MGT account, and another 5 days on top of that to launder it. Such a pain. Intersango, if you&#039;re reading this, sort it out!!&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Updated: Mtgox are currently celebrating &#039;golden week&#039; in Japan, which means business has basically come to a standstill until the 6th of may.
