				For obvious reasons, I will be revealing very few details about this situation.<br /><br />I received a letter from US Customs &amp; Border Control stating that items were seized en route to me.&nbsp; The odd thing is, the items they list having seized are not products I&#039;ve ever ordered.&nbsp; They also claim to have seized what I would consider a LARGE amount of the product (way more than I would have ever considered ordering, even if I wanted said product).<br /><br />To make this even more complex, I am not missing any packages except for a 4/20 order from tony76, which we&#039;ve all assumed by now was never sent.&nbsp; So I figured, maybe a different vendor I ordered from before the sale made a (HUGE!) mistake and sent me something extra.&nbsp; I looked through my feedback, and I&#039;m not convinced that happened: I had made very few purchases before 4/20, all were domestic (no customs), and none were addressed to the name or address I received the customs letter to.&nbsp; In fact, tony76 is the only one who had this information!&nbsp; It literally *could not* be any other vendor&#039;s product, since they wouldn&#039;t know to ship it to me at that address.<br /><br />This leads me to two (or three) possible conclusions, please feel free to suggest other possibilities:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Tony76 actually sent out the product, but it was seized and never arrived.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this is likely, since no one on these forums received their 4/20 purchases from tony76, no one else has claimed to have received a customs letter, and the amount of product customs claimed to have confiscated is many times larger than the amount I ordered from tony76.&nbsp; It is also not the same product as what I ordered from tony76, but he could have lied about what the product contained, or customs could have made a mistake (maybe they use cheap tests).<br /><br />2a)&nbsp; Tony76 was being watched before the 4/20 sale, and was busted with a lot of product packed, addressed, and ready to ship.&nbsp; This could maybe explain why so much product was attributed to me, but does not explain why the letter came from customs if it was never shipped.&nbsp; Maybe they&#039;re just pretending it went through customs so we don&#039;t know about tony76 being busted?&nbsp; I have no idea what to think.<br /><br />2b)&nbsp; Similar to 2a, but perhaps tony76 cooperated with the police in some way (if he was busted, how did he post that he was &quot;going on vacation&quot; after the sale?).<br /><br /><br />This whole situation has left me feeling confused and uncomfortable.&nbsp; Obviously I have cleaned house, and won&#039;t be ordering to that address again, but I would appreciate any advice, reassurances, or ideas you might have.&nbsp; Thanks.

				It&#039;s more likely that another vendor got mixed up with an order they sent to you before and used your address again twice by accident.<br /><br />Remember it would take a few weeks for the customs to send you the letter.

				One thing I do know, is that if Law Enforcement catch you with 1 gram of cocaine, and 100 grams of something harmless which could be used to bulk up cocaine, say creatine, then they will claim they caught you with 101 grams of cocaine, of a purity of 1%.<br /><br />Now we know Tony76 was well known for cutting stuff, there&#039;s a thread posted somewhere today about someone doing a test on his stuff and finding it ridiculously cut. So perhaps he started doing the 420 sale, thinking &quot;people are going to call me a legend, worship me for how much I send them&quot; then gave up? Then perhaps the customs labs took AGES to work out that it wasn&#039;t talcum powder. It&#039;s not unreasonable, it takes a few weeks just to send a normal letter, so something really cut would take longer.

				Maybe US Customs seized a bunch of tony&#039;s orders at one time and sent the same letter, listing all the products in all the packages, to each of the recipients?&nbsp; Maybe some sort of clerical error?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you have anything to worry about.&nbsp; As long as you&#039;ve cleaned house and are not using that address anymore, you should be fine.
