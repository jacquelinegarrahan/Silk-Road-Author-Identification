				Just go to this website (clearnet) - https://blockchain.info/ - and type your BTC address into the search box and hit ENTER. You will need approx. 6 confirmations before your coins will go through and then you may have to wait a little longer before they show up in your Wallet. It varies but it can take anything from an hour up to 6+ hours.

				21 confirmations later and still the BTC have not showed up in my SR account. Something is definitely wrong, they usually show up in my SR wallet after 6-8 confirmations. I&#039;ve been perusing other threads, and it looks like everything has been put on hold, both withdrawals from SR and deposits into SR.

But they can all be tracked by using blockchain.info, and you&#039;ll see that your bitcoinfog address does not show up, it&#039;s another address, which proves your coins are untraceable due to their mixing service.
