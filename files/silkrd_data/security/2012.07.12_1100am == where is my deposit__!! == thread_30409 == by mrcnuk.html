				That seems like quite a while to wait, I would contact whoever sent the BTC to your account to find out whats happening.<br />That all I got for you, give some more details and maybe someone can point you in the right direction.

				Someone helped me out yesterday, I was having the same problem but it only took mine 18 hours to show up. Go to this website and on the right side of the page enter in your SR wallet address. Here is the website....http://blockchain.info/. It should let you know if the coins are on the way. Also the bitcoin company should have gave you a 160hash address for you to search as well. Hope this helps.

				Have you sent SR support a message? I would do that. To my understanding they aren&#039;t replying to anyone&#039;s message about the coin situation but it couldn&#039;t hurt. Good luck man I feel your pain.

If after this time it has not arrived, please send me the relevant bitcoin address to me so I can look into it.<br /><br />~SR Support<br /><br />hang fire and it will work out I guess
