				&nbsp;Looking for some feedback on their service, looks like a decent option for bank deposit transactions. <br />Can anyone tell me how their experience was in dealing with them? Eg. how is the customer service, response time, anonymity etc.<br />Thanks.

				I know im bumping this thread back, but im from india and so far this is the only anonymous method of found of buying bitcoins here... It does work, i have done many transactions with them. I think while taking the receipt, you have to make sure your transaction is after 8 30 and before 5 30 IST, otherwise it says sorry, please try later. It is done because the btc price is too volatile, and could crash/drop every few hours. Basically you should get the receipt online, and go do the deposit of exact deposit amount immendiately, and it should show up in their system withink 4 hours, they fund you instantly
