				Hey, so in my year on the road I gathered quite a collection of different psychedelics. I have a dead-drop for my life-time supply but still have a sample of every substance I ever ordered at home. Like .8 MDMA 5 LSD trips etc.<br /><br />Do you even have substances for personal supply at your home? Or is that generally a bad idea?<br /><br />

				I think a good rule is to use a piece of furniture with five drawers.&nbsp; They should all be the same size drawers.&nbsp; Once you have all five full but not spilling over, it is time to buy another piece of furniture with larger drawers.&nbsp; Once you have upgraded a couple of times and can no longer find any furniture with larger drawers, this is enough drugs.&nbsp; Stop at that point.

				No one should really have any clue you have samples of different substances in your home. If you openly told people or think the cops will be knocking on your door soon, forget it, but that really doesn&#039;t seem to be the case. Try keeping things locked away in a safe which is a pretty standard thing to do in any home and shouldn&#039;t raise alarms unless the cops come knocking for you. Hidden compartments that tend to be smell proof and out of sight tend to elude cops too in the event they do come looking. Best thing would be to not keep them there, but who would part with such a collection? The furniture idea is great, but I would investigate different ways of using the drawers or the space under them instead of just filling them up with drugs and other things as that tends to be very obvious and easy to access. Up to you though. Happy furniture shopping.

				If the drugs no longer physically fit in your house, like they are coming out the chimney, then you have too much drugs in your house.

				I would say it depends on the country and or state you live in and what kind of drugs they are. Obviously if you are a vendor it is ideal to ether have a lockbox with the key hidden extremely well (not on your keychain for god&#039;s sake) or to keep them offsite somewhere safe.

				I&#039;ve thought over this issue a lot, but I still cant really think of any legit hiding place at home that would be suitable for a personal sized stash but that you could still easily get to when you wanted your shit.<br /><br />you could of course go all out and put stuff under your floor boards and whatnot, but I can&#039;t think of any &#039;convenient&#039; hiding place that would hold out if LE search your house

				What about renting out a storage unit close to home and just picking out of it whenever you need. Most storage buildings aren&#039;t busy at all around my area. You would just have to keep everything airtight so you cant smell it walking past the unit
