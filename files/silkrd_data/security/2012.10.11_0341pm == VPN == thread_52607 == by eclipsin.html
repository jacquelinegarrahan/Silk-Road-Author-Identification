				Yes, There is private internet access. You can pay with BTC or many other ways.<br /><br />https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/FEDORA001<br />If you sign up I get a percentage paid to me in BTC! <br /><br />I would suggest getting the yearly service it&#039;s like $3 a month and it works great with windows and Linux.<br /><br />Also their support is quick and awesome.<br /><br />Let me know if you need any help!

				So I should just download my movies from McDownalds? Or just use my own IP? Yeah, that&#039;s a whole lot safer. No one can see what I&#039;m doing at McDonalds, Oh wait I like to sit and watch what everyone else is doing on their wireless devices, so I bet no one can see what I&#039;m doing. <br /><br />Whatever you decide do some research. :o

				You best bet is to do your research on all vpns available, I would recommend one that uses open vpn the best, and always read there privacy policies, also try and look for a vpn that is in a country that either a) does not require them to keep logs or B) does not have an extradition treaty with your country of origin (so a court order requesting your info would not be very likely to be followed) Google is your best friend for finding these options out.

				I would be cautious of the free ones, some of them will sell your web history with advertising agencies and market research agencies, witch means they keep logs that leo can subpena

No offense creep1 but even if you are anonymous, people should not be linking themselves to your anonymous account by a referral. Really not worth the even the tiny possibility that it could be traced at any time.<br /><br />As for VPN/VPS providers that accept bitcoins there are a lot:<br /><br />https://bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade<br /><br />http://www.thebitcoinlist.com/dp_internet/vps-vpn/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I can suggest a good use for a vpn. When you want to check on a dcn, that is a good use. Want to be even safer? Sign up with packagetrackr a free service which gives me 100 btc for each person who signs up. Sign up with a vpn and use it to check delivery status. The post office can flag tor, they might be able to flag a vpn. But, unless they flag all users of this service which seems unlikely, you are safe. They demand the records of the vpn? Fine, they discover you were using tor and the trail ends there. Tor &gt; vpn &gt; to the place you want to remain anon.

				Well, you guys were right. I got a knock on the door promptly at 6 am this morning by the FBI. They read me my rights and said I was being charged with recommending VPN&#039;s and BTC on the SK forums. They then proceeded to tell me that I was going away for a long, long time unless I cooperated fully with them. They wanted to know how VPN&#039;s work and how they could use them or are they just for criminals? :-X<br /><br />In all seriousness I was just trying to help by recommending a good VPN because I have done a lot of research on the matter. <br /><br />And even if LEO&#039;s found me through my affiliate ID it wouldn&#039;t matter much because really all I have done is recommend a VPN. <br /><br />I&#039;m no big time drug dealer or anything so I really hope they have bigger fish to fry.&nbsp; &nbsp;
