				That&#039;s very sad news.&nbsp; I feel sorry for the two who got busted. :-(&nbsp; Especially if they were distributing &quot;the good stuff&quot; - we need more heroes who do that!

				yeah, hopefully someone here can give more details <br /><br />found this..<br /><br />&quot;The pair were indicted on two counts of distributing less than 10 grams but more than 1 gram of LSD and one count of distribution of less than 10 grams but more than 1 gram of LSD and ketamine, according to court documents. <br /><br />The grand jury also indicted Redfern on a single count of profiting from the use of a building for distribution of controlled substances.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				Enelysion was the best supplier ever.&nbsp; The best LSD ever.&nbsp; Cheap prices.&nbsp; Reliable.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/ovdb/ac/viewtopic.php?pid=13361#p13361<br /><br />That&#039;s his thread ^ , some people talked to his wife (on home detention) via jabber and she gave more details.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been watching him since May.&nbsp; Not sure if its internet related or not.&nbsp; Wife said she thinks it was someone that sold them LSD that snitched (and there is something about a friend of his killing himself, maybe from the guilt of snitching..&nbsp; nobody knows its like a big puzzle).<br /><br />http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20110806/LOCAL03/308069935/1039/LOCAL03<br />

				Bummer man.&nbsp; They don&#039;t deserve this.<br /><br />The only thing they should have done differently was not talking to the police.&nbsp; From the article, it seems his wife admitted guilt when arrested and even identified substances for the arresting officer.<br /><br />IF QUESTIONED BY AN LEO, INVOKE YOUR RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT AND REQUEST A LAWYER!&nbsp; DO NOT SPEAK TO THEM FOR ANY REASON!<br />

				So, let me get this straight. <br /><br />The reason they were caught was due to a human factor (snitch) and not security issue with the TOR network?<br /><br />I think it&#039;s good to mentally prepare for the possibility so that you can handle the situation as cool as possible, i.e. not talking or admitting guilt!<br /><br />Send in the lawyers...

				They were busted due to human factors - (Attracting Attention Via MDMA by the Key post), (Admitting guilt - though this was only the wife), (Not changing up packaging or drop locations - they were videotaped dropping of the packages at the same mailboxs). Shitty he was a good vendor in terms of product. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
