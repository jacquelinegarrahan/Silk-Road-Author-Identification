				This same Stacy Litz?<br /><br />Pardon me, but -&nbsp; did she in fact cover the arrest of the people on whom she informed? It&#039;s not 100% clear, comparing it to the gdoc, but there are many overlaps.<br />Even if it&#039;s a separate incident, the last paragraph of her story is filed under &quot;I just can&#039;t even.&quot;<br /><br />hxxp://www.examiner.com/article/the-drug-war-rages-on-west-philly<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">February 1, 2012<br />&nbsp;The drug war rages on in West Philly<br />Stacy Litz<br />Yesterday, on the 4800 block of Florence Street, 5 total individuals were arrested and charged regarding an LSD ring -- $28,000 worth of the untaxed substance was confiscated along with $10,000 in cash.&nbsp; Two of the individuals were students at Drexel University.&nbsp; <br />The police were made aware of the LSD ring due to two students who were arrested on their own charges and then allowed to opportunity to work as informants to eleviate their own charges.&nbsp; <br />The story has been made juicier by including that Raphael Zappala, one of the men arrested, was the son of a prominent anti-war activist, Celeste Zappala, who began protesting in 2004 when her son (and Raphael&#039;s brother) was killed in Baghdad within the National Guard.&nbsp; <br />Zappala worked at Philadelphia&#039;s Coalition Against Hunger and was depicted as an &quot;upstanding&quot; person, according to a friend Chris Robinson, who connected LSD use to being unable to act in a civil manner, &quot;It doesn&#039;t sound like him.&nbsp; He always seemed very upstanding . . . I&#039;ve heard him speak several times at public meetings.&quot;&nbsp; <br />This event shows that the drug war is alive and well in Philadelphia, and that many people are taking the opportunity to work as informants for the police, despite their own beliefs on the matter.&nbsp; When it comes down to being put in jail or saving yourself, principles get put aside and it becomes man against man in a never ending cycle.&nbsp; Instead of possible rehabilitation, ex-dealers are forced to stay in the game and even get involved in situations in which they may not usually be present to lessen their sentence.&nbsp; This example shows how fear and intimidation is used to prevent those who may be the most driven and outspoken drug war activists to cave into the system, lay low and even work against what their beliefs.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ps: I&#039;ll go with narcissist, if we&#039;re playing armchair diagnostician.&nbsp; <br />TLP put it very well:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All narcissists have this potential, it is intrinsic to the personality structure, which is defined as &quot;me above all things.&quot;&nbsp; Sure, usually they figure out non-violent ways to live their life, but that potential is there.<br />The reason a psychopath kills is because he is bad.&nbsp; The reason a narcissist kills is so that no one finds out he is bad.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>hxxp://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2008/10/psychopathy_antisocial_persona.html#more<br />[one of the very few psychiatry blogs that does not cause me to break out in hives and tics]

				I found it surprising that they were able to track all the text messages back to the date, confront her about it and just &quot;talk&quot; and ask questions. I don&#039;t advocate hitting women, but I&#039;d have had to crack that bitches jaw open. And her boyfriend knew the whole time and tried to explain her actions as acceptable?

				Say what you want about Stacy Litz, but what is really sick is the US legal system. In most civilized countries, you will not get a reduced sentence if you become an informant. Putting that kind of pressure (go to jail or snitch on your friends) on anyone is considered disproportionate to the goal it is meant to achieve. In fact I believe such a system would conflict with the European Convention of Human Rights. The same is true for the US system of plea bargains.

				sort of off topic but felt like posting this just cuz. iv always felt that certain types of people were a more likely candidate to be a snitch, and you should adjust your clients accordingly ( obviously this isnt as easy on SR). my personal opinion and thic certainly isnt always the case but iv felt that these types of opople would be pressured more easily and fold quicker. people with kids, they dont want to hear about how their kids are gonna be taken and put in a foster home. people who are deeper in school like soon to graduate (college) or have a lot of financial aid to lose or dont wanna get kicked outta college n lose that time n $ investment over tellin where the got a sack. also people who are are already on probation or have enough previous charges that would be facing real time theyll justify it to themself that &quot;o man ill do a lot more time than he would&quot;. there is also that person who you know is just not trustworthy. they will dip in your sack when you leave the room and snitch when they get caught with it. and there is always that person who you just know couldnt handle the pressure of sitting in a cell. and never deal with strangers thats just asking for it. there are more people who would turn snitch than would not these days try to isolate yourself from these people you dont need them or their business. closed circles of trustworthy people and closed mouths will go a long way one weak link in the chain is all it takes be cautious and smart trust ur gut and NEVER snitch.<br /><br /><br />i think it should be like public record on snitching (of course it never will) then if everyone would know what type of character they had. and if people knew ahead of time that just anyone could look in the news paper and see the snitch that brought the case down they might think twice. also they would have to and should live with the shame that they cant hold their own and fold up like a bitch. maybe if that ever happen more snitches would just kill themself and do the world a favor instead of replicating and passing those weak bitch ass traits on to their kids and continuing the cycle of people undeserving of living in our society.

				Yea the US legal system is a bitch. When they got you, they got you. It takes a real stupid motherfucke to admit they ordered something just because it has your name and address on it but if that&#039;s the case, that person should keep their mouth shut and never agree to set up other people just to try to save their own ass because in reality, it wont save their ass. The police will tell you that shit but they lie. If they got some kind of evidence then it is best to eat the bullet and lawyer up. Get caught in a crime then do the time but don&#039;t agree to do anything to help them sunsofbitches

				A guy I know flipped on his heroin dealer at the scene of the arrest (heroin posession) and was let go with his dope as well. He was also not prompted by police to do this in any way. Goes to show that its not always impossible to help yourself out. Kid turned out to be a little bitch. It was in ATL tho and theres a bad heroin problem especially east in the bluffs (where he was popped). They just let him walk. He was shot four times in the head with a shotgun outside of the georgia dome in his car like a week later though.&nbsp; LOL

I mean, they can fight a case better if they truly think your innocent, rather than already knowing you&#039;re a criminal, but then again, that&#039;s why they say lawyer have no morals huh?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s an excellent question--does he know everything--because I always told them everything, the way you are supposed to, and it never seemed to bother them.&nbsp; I just figure that way they are prepared, but sometimes I wonder.&nbsp; I think it would depend.&nbsp; There might be a situation where I wanted him really believing in me....but well, generally, I would want lawyer to know it all....but I also would want to make sure I had a lawyer good enough to really go to town for me, even if I&#039;m guilty.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mostly want a guy who is a trial lawyer, as I said, not a guy who eats lunch with the prosecutor after trial and goes fishing with him...I&#039;ve known defense attorneys who really *hated* prosecuting attorneys and that&#039;s who I want...but also, money plays a big factor over here....no money, no honey as the whores say ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, but ideally you want a lawyer that you can tell everything if you&#039;re guilty and he can consider it all from a legal perspective and coach you on what best to admit and not to, and how best to present it all so you&#039;ll get off. :)&nbsp; Kind of like the &quot;criminal&quot; lawyer that represented the gangs in The Wire and also acted as an informal consultant.
