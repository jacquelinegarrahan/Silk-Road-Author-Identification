				A) Keep a low profile.&nbsp; Make sure you don&#039;t have any illegal substances sitting around your house.<br />B) If there&#039;s nothing in the contents of the text messages that would indicate that you had anything to do with your friend&#039;s acquisition of the drugs, don&#039;t worry.<br />C) Even if there is, that sort of evidence is circumstantial at best and probably not likely to lead to a warrant.<br />D) Don&#039;t pay anyone on here for advice.&nbsp; Unless someone here is actually a criminal defense attorney in your jurisdiction, anything that they tell you is, while well-intentioned, ultimately worthless.&nbsp; <br /><br />In other words... if you&#039;re seriously worried, talk to a lawyer.&nbsp; Period.

It is not easy or inexpensive to get a wiretap, and if they have tapped your phone no amount of beating around the bush or using silly code phrases is going to keep you safe.<br /><br />But you are correct in that any drug related conversation should happen in person, and you should never mention anything even remotely related to drug trade on any clearnet website.

				Talk to a lawyer.<br /><br />Almost every lawyer gives a FREE consultation over the phone.&nbsp; They do this to show they know what they&#039;re talking about, to see if they&#039;re interested in your case, and to sell you their services.&nbsp; A lot of people don&#039;t understand that you can talk to one completely free, it&#039;s all in how you pitch that initial phone call.&nbsp; You&#039;d be surprised what you can learn in 5 minutes on the phone.&nbsp; And if you call a lawyer that refuses to help you at all, call the next one in the book;&nbsp; there are 1000&#039;s to pick from.&nbsp; You want a criminal lawyer, and if you call a wrong one, ask for a referral.<br /><br />What I do is research to understand some of the terminology (right here on SR isn&#039;t a bad place to *start*, but definitely not your end point), get a list of questions, call a lawyer.&nbsp; More research, new questions, call a new lawyer.&nbsp; Repeat.&nbsp; It won&#039;t take you more than a day or two, and you&#039;ll have a good feel for what you&#039;re dealing with.&nbsp; It sounds like your first question is going to be about text messages.&nbsp; Look up information on circumstantial evidence as well (that may be what a text message is, depending on jurisdiction).
