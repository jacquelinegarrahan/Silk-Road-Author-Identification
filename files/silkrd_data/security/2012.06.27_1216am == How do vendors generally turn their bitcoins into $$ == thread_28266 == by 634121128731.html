				Without arousing suspicion?<br /><br />I have been considering becoming a vendor, specialising in cannabis for the last little while. I have access to capital, a source for regular amounts of product, a vacuum sealer, a vehicle to do drops, and all of that. I have thought my business model through quite a lot, and yet I cannot figure out how I would go about turning my bitcoins into real dollars at the end of the cycle.<br /><br />I understand that some people offer to send cash in the mail in exchange for bitcoins. Does anybody know how safe this is? I would hate to have 4 or 5 thousand dollars go missing in the mail and not be able to restock my product. I couldn&#039;t even find this service through SR though. I also considered getting an Aus Post pre paid visa, and loading funds onto that at the end of each cycle, but the pre paid visas require identification, and I am unsure if that amount of money at that frequency would ring any alarms.<br /><br />I understand that I will have a lot to learn once I start, but at the moment my major issue is the one I just spoke of, and I can&#039;t figure it out. I am also in a bit of a dilemma, as I understand that current vendors/SR users will probably be hesitant to tell a random person on the SR forums about their business practices, so if this thread and talk like this is a bad idea on here, I understand. Can somebody please point me in the right direction to figure all this out though?<br /><br />Thanks for your help guys. I appreciate your time.

				I found that best way to go is to convert bitcoins to another electronic money like LibertyReserve, because quite few old emoney systems are offering ATM cards for withdrawal. It works instant, do transaction online and go to ATM. do your research, I doubt there is better way around.
