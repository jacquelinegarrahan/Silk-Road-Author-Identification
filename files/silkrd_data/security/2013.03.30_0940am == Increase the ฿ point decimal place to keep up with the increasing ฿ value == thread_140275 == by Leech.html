				With the advent of time and popularity of BTC, it&#039;s possible for the value to reach 100/฿ or even 1000/฿. Since currently SR only has a 0.00 value for BTC, it&#039;s time to implement a 0.000 or 0.0000 soon, in order for pricing to be much more accurate.<br /><br />It would be more wonderful if one can customize the number of decimal place of ฿.

				yes I had this problem! I was buying something that cost .50 BTC and I had .5 btc in my wallet but apparently i had insufficient funds.. <br />So I converted everything to USD and apparently I was 9 cents too short. and 9 cents is like a tenth of a .01 BTC. So yea we deff need another decimal place along with the &quot;sort by price&quot; feature

				There&#039;s a laundry list of things the site and the forums need..... but for now, just be happy that you found a place where you can anonymously buy any illegal drug–with escrow service. :)&nbsp; That&#039;s the way I look at it.<br /><br />lelmeriodici

DPR/admins are running a business. Yes, SR is a godsend for many who want to avoid the streets/experiment with new drugs/move their business to a safer marketplace. But why should that stop them from fixing the many things wrong with the main site and forums? Just because the site is an eBay for contraband doesn&#039;t mean its owners are exempt from criticism. Especially when DPR will have a HUGE amount to his name thanks to people like you and I.

				You&#039;re entirely right.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that DPR (and friends...?) aren&#039;t very responsive to suggestions.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ve gone from anger to despair. :P<br /><br />You&#039;ve also got to remember than your account could disappear in the blink of an eye.&nbsp; Unlikely with DPR, but if you&#039;re causing a lot of trouble, it&#039;s certainly something I would do. :p<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				We&#039;re responsive to suggestions, but the ultimate authority on the matter is, of course, DPR ... and DPR has a lot to deal with every day, so I&#039;m certain that when he prioritizes things, some of our suggestions do not make it onto his &quot;TO DO!&quot; list.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, I think this BTC issue is of particular importance due to the increase, so I&#039;ll do what I can to bring it up with him and with SR Support.&nbsp; It&#039;s also probably not enormously difficult to implement, so we will see!

				There&#039;s nothing I can do to implement changes - I am not a member of the SR staff.&nbsp; Please understand that it is not my job or my place to implement changes or to respond personally to the suggestions, as much as I&#039;d like to.&nbsp; What I mean is that samesamebutdifferent and I are responsive to these things and we do pass suggestions along to the admin and the staff.&nbsp; That&#039;s as much as we can do.

				I&#039;m not allowed to delete the penis account (as much as I&#039;d like to!) -- because we can only delete when something is a scam, spam, or endangering someone else ... but I&#039;ve deleted a few of that creep&#039;s posts when he spams non-newbie threads with his bullshit.&nbsp; I&#039;ll continue doing that when his posts are reported so I know where to find them.<br /><br />If you see a post by him in the middle of a normal thread, hit that &quot;report to moderator&quot; button and I&#039;ll take care of it.&nbsp; :)
