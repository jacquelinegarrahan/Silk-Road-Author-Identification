				i would assume 1) it will be logged by the computer every time you insert or remove it, and 2) LE will find it.<br /><br />definitely encrypt the usb stick, but even that isn&#039;t enough.<br /><br />I would install 2 VMs on the usb stick using truecrypt with one a dummy you give to LE and one the hidden one you deny exists.<br />

				If you get too fancy you might lose your bitcoins so be careful. There is no law against having btc, using tor or pgp. So be careful but not so fancy you can&#039;t get your btc back again.

				To the above. <br />They weren&#039;t asking about losing bit coins or anything, although that was a good thing to point out, and that these aren&#039;t illegal was another good point unless these are used for illegal purposes ;)<br />They wanted to know if they have all these on a usb would it not leave a trace on their computer. <br /><br />I will not answer this as I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m pretty Tech savy, but not sure on this.

				I don&#039;t even know where to begin... this topic could be turned into a volume of novels.<br />This thread is a good start: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=49334.0<br /><br />Short answer, no. NO NO NO NO NO. Just No.<br />That being said, it definitely depends what exactly you&#039;re doing. If you are a buyer who is just dealing with personal amounts... sure it&#039;s probably OK as it&#039;s pretty unlikely that they&#039;re going to confiscate your computer and all that if you&#039;re caught. Now, if you&#039;re a vendor and/or reseller... then read the above. Or, I&#039;ll repeat it here: NO NO NO NO NO. Just No! 8)<br />.Hades.
