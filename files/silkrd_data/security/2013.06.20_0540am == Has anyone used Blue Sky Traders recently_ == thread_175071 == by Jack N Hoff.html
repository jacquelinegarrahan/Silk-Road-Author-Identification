				I think they are. I just sent them an email and got a response about 5 hours ago. Their site sometimes goes down for whatever reason.

				I just put an order in for around half a G for deposit tomorrow, and I have already received the &quot;pre-confirmation&quot; e-mail.&nbsp; I don&#039;t anticipate any issues with them.

				without sounding like a damn politician, because they are good for nothing, I am here to accommodate the btc community. I have bitcoin to sell and at a great rate. I&#039;m not a vendor, I&#039;m not an esrow dealer - If you want to deale peer t peer, let&#039;s make a deal.

				Actually you sound like an amateur scammer. You can&#039;t vend or sell through the forums.. unless you&#039;re vendor, which you&#039;re not. And nobody is retarded enough to fall for it.

				I sent an email last night before i passed out to BST and when I woke up had an email with depost information.<br />Made my deposit about 10 am, cam home at 4:30pm and my coins were already in my wallet. BST is a legit alternative to bitinstant. more convenient in my opinion because you dont have to remember your fake name and info ;) thanks BST!
