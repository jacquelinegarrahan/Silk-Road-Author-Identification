				&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed a trend of including handwritten notes in photos of products, vendor name, date etc.&nbsp; For the uber-paranoid: Why give out a handwriting sample to the world?&nbsp; Forensic analysis of handwriting is a well developed science,&nbsp; so it&#039;s almost like leaving a finger print in each photo.&nbsp; A printed note will serve the purpose just as well.

				Handwriting analysis is never going to be approved as hard evidence, but i guess this depends on the jurisdiction in your country. However, I think it is a big no-no!

				Handwriting is much more difficult to photoshop onto paper of a picture. Anyone can post a great generic picture of bud but the handwritten name date is pretty good evidence that the real person/group posted the photo. <br /><br />It is a small security risk to the vendor, but it is good evidence of legitimacy and is a good thing for buyers to check for. It lessens the chance you are dealing with LE or a scam because at least the the vendor has the product.

				OH- EM - GEE, I was just going to write a new thread on this! You guys read my mind.<br /><br />Sellers, DO NOT USE YOUR OWN HAND-WRITING ON YOUR PHOTOS! While most sellers print shipping labels, any LE could compare a hand-written one to that of a photo. Come on guys, use yer noggins.<br /><br />Just print on a MS Word document, and print it or something. For that matter, there isn&#039;t even a reason to write on the product. The product is associated with your listing. So, when the potential buyer clicks on image, it goes directly to listing/seller. No need to write on there.<br /><br />Just my two Euros.

				I do my proof pics handwritten. I just use different writing styles than my real one.<br />Using special artistic pens such as ones with shining specks and such will make it even more authentic looking in 7MP photos.

I don&#039;t think handwriting analysis is anything like as sophisticated as OP believes. At least, not from a low-res shot of 2 or 3 written words anyway.<br /><br />Or, if you are worried, write in plain block caps or with the pen in your left hand or something.
