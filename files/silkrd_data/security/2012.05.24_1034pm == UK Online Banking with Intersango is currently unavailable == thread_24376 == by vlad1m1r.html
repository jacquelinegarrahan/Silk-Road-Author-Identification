				Dear all,<br /><br />I logged in to Intersango a few moments ago to read the following message:<br /><br />&quot;Online banking with our UK bank is currently unavailable. Payments are being received however we cannot process them. This has happened before and was dealt with in a timely manner.&quot;<br /><br />This is less than ideal as I had just sent a ton of cash their way!<br /><br />To any of my customers who are still waiting on orders of Bitcoins rest assured I will honour them and they will be fulfilled ASAP. Fortunately I have enough Bitcoins to tide over any pending orders. If this problem persists I will switch to MtGox.<br /><br />Keep calm and carry on! :-)<br /><br />V.

				They seem to be having a few problems over the last while - last time because one of them was on holiday and was the only one with the password.<br />They seem to get things sorted though, Patrick was on skype last time and seemed quite open and honest about the whole situation..<br />Feel for you though Vlad - its a nightmare having money floating around with them when this sort of thing happens.

				Supposedly they knew there where problems at least three days before they posted the status update. Their communication has always been shockingly poor. No different than other exchanges to be fair. The best place to find info / status updates in bitcointalk.org. From reading their posts / what others have said, I wouldn&#039;t trust em with large sums of cash. It doesn&#039;t help their registered address is just a glorified PO BOX. I like knowing that if someone fucked me over I could hunt them down and slap my dangly balls off their chin&nbsp; ;D Can&#039;t do that when they hide behind fake business addresses...<br /><br />

Of course sellers needn&#039;t worry as they can just obtain Bitcoins by vending goods via SR - as for me I am temporarily switching allegiances to MtGox in order to replenish my rapidly diminishing stockpile of Bitcoins but for anyone in the UK who needs Bitcoins please rest assured there is no danger of exposing your identity and I have gone to some lengths to make sure the business bank account funding the MtGox account cannot be traced back to me. I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t say anything more on this?<br /><br />One of my investors just messaged me pointing out that if I were very mercenary I&#039;d realise that this is probably going to increase my sales but frankly this Intersango business is proving to be a bit of a nuisance for me too! The sooner they&#039;re up and running the better.<br /><br />If any of my customers are reading, Intersango trading rates are still visible and I will honour this rate for current orders. New customers please PM me for a quotation. <br /><br />V.

This service is actually my main bread and butter - quite simply the offer on the table is that if you invest up to $500 of Bitcoins over 30 days, you&#039;ll get a return of 6% (I allow some wiggle room due to the fluctuations of the Bitcoin!). At the moment I am investing in legal ventures. <br /><br />When I first posted about this naturally people were interested in principle but I couldn&#039;t offer this service directly without a seller account and also investors wanted more information on where their money goes.<br /><br />I do invest some of it in the precious metals market via my work but obviously I can&#039;t go into specifics(!) I also have a hefty amount of my own cash ploughed into a Bitcoin trading bot which is ticking over nicely (the GBP value of the Bitcoin is through the roof at the moment!)<br /><br />A small amount of funds was invested in start up businesses on Black market Reloaded but I&#039;ve since stopped doing this as it was risky and I like the idea of investing in ethical businesses - for instance one guy told me he was just selling cash for BTC as I do but started listing fradulent travelers&#039; cheques).<br /><br />Nothing much to add except to say that your investment is guaranteed and that obviously we can negotiate better rates the longer you invest and for larger sums. <br /><br />At the moment I am returning investments in BTC - if you need help with money laundering I suggest you speak to Limetless - I am aware of the theory but only practice it to the extent necessary to protect mine and my client&#039;s privacy!<br /><br />V. <br /><br />

				I have a prepaid credit card not registered to any address or name - I put cash on this at the post office then thru tor I create a payment to intersango. Occasionally it&#039;s not credited until I email them (tormail) and they say there was no reference with the deposit and credit my account after I give them details like when the deposit was made and from what card, so I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s as anonymous as cash

				Intersango is a piece of dog shit ran by a blind folded chimp. Actually none of the UK banking was processing for many many days before they made that public announcement. I think they like to wait for 400 e-mails complaining before they acknowledge the problem. Probably because those announcements stop people from depositing money, and that means less £££ conveniently disappearing for an unknown time. Let&#039;s not forget the amount of money we are talking about here when we think about deposits made into their account over several days. Grands.<br /><br />Even when it&#039;s functioning fine bank transfers seem to take a fucking eternity with Intersango. I really hate that company and I can&#039;t wait to get my cash withdrawn from their dirty little hands so I can take my business the fuck elsewhere. It&#039;s just incessant problems with them and their UK banks, all of the problems with Lloyds, then they say we will switch and everything will be great, and now this shit. I just hate them and their arrogance when you complain on IRC. Basically they don&#039;t give a shit.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to withdraw my money from those thieving bastards for the last 8 days.

				..i have no idea, they would probably want to distant themselves from anything SR but thats a personal choice, least anyone could direct questions or post the odd reply or solution = communication.; an SR account doesn&#039;t have to have any connection to any real person @intersango its not<br />a requirement i wouldnt recommend it; Patrick uses skype and IRC (apparently?!), and from posts its suggested that msg&#039;s mount up before anyone decides to act and post a public statement; i&#039;m not suggesting anyone needs to be forced to be here and answer just would be<br />step towards progress.<br /><br /><br />

				- further issues with regards to intersango are they are a business, and just like any Co&#039;s making public statements they would need to very<br />&nbsp; careful what is disclosed.<br /><br />- we are all pretty fed up with not being able to get a bank deposit into bitcoins, and in intersango&#039;s defence they too are battling with keeping <br />&nbsp; those bank relationships going and must be a frustrating situation, we are all fighting or playing a part in the bigger war against the system, if<br />&nbsp; the banks didnt act like arseholes intersango would&nbsp; flourish.<br /><br />

We are sorry for the recent delays this has caused. Everything has been fixed and is operating normally as of this morning. We are also confident that if a similar problem arises again we will be able to fix it faster due to our recent experience. Thank you for your patience. &quot;<br /><br />I am pleased to say my Bitcoin service is running under full steam once again! <br /><br />@Lex, using a bank account means the purchase of Bitcoins can be traced to you although you will hugely reduce the chance of this happening if you deposit cash. MtGox do permit this through their Barclays account but Intersango does not. As you know you can&#039;t connect to the MtGox website via Tor or public proxies without being asked to verify your identity either.<br /><br />I accept Bitcoins for cash in the mail which is much safer than either wiring money from your bank account or using cash with MtGox, please see my link below if you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

Having said this if it&#039;s possible to prove you deposited a certain amount of BTC into Bitcoinfog for instance and then a few days later a similar amount leaves the &quot;fog&quot; then it still might be possible to trace the transaction - so make sure you use Bitcoinfog&#039;s settings to withdraw random amounts over longer periods of time. You can also run your coins more than once through a mixer to give you extra security. It&#039;ll cost you between 1 and 3% each time you do.<br /><br />..Or of course you can just buy them with cash and save yourself the trouble! :-D<br /><br />V.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Yeah i actually registered on the forum just to complain about this, fairly new to the road but recently switched from mtgox to intersango had two fast trouble free transactions and now also been waiting from friday. Have contacted them and heard nothing back is there a chance the money could be fully lost if they can&#039;t register the transfer or do they have a obligation to at least refund any money sent to the account they use?

				Fuck Intersango!, I sent over £40 yesterday and having a good history with them I thought it&#039;d be in within a few hours, I come to check it today and still nothing so I think to myself lets check support to see how long it takes and it says this:<br /><br />&quot;Metro Bank (UK) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical error on Metro interface. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical error on Metro interface.&quot;<br /><br />Why the fuck don&#039;t they put that shit on the homepage, had they done so I would have used a different service and would probably have my bitcoins now, no acid for me this weekend :(

Deposits still work.<br />- Actually, deposits are missing too, how odd. Oh well.<br />- Some withdrawals were &quot;accidentally&quot; marked as sent. If you have a problem with this, please wait 2 days before complaining.<br />- Don&#039;t try contacting Metro, they are of course incompetent/liars and won&#039;t confirm Intersango&#039;s claims.<br /><br />They keep talking about withdrawals and avoid the deposit issue. Maybe that&#039;s to avoid the question of why they can&#039;t just check and credit accounts manually?

				The latest update (God give me strength) :<br /><br /><br />&quot;While we were previously under the impression that the problems we were having with Metro bank were due to a technical issue on their end (as this has happened before), we have been told that our account activity is being reviewed and that we must be patient during this process. We have faith that our contact at Metro bank will properly investigate the matter. They have indicated that they do not require information from us at this time. The resolution time we were given was around 1 week, however this is just an approximation.<br /><br />We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused our userbase. We are doing everything we can to resolve the problem as fast as possible. In the future, we may not be able to accept payments quite as fast anymore to prevent fraud however we will work hard to decrease our resolution times for issues and make the experience of purchasing and selling bitcoins as easy for the UK as possible.<br /><br />We understand that many people have called Metro bank and Metro has told them that there is no issue. This is entirely incorrect. We believe it in not intentional it is simply that their support staff assumes that if there is not an issue affecting all accounts or a huge number of accounts at the bank that there is not an issue with our account.&quot;<br /><br />My own bank would only freeze an account in response to a court order as far as I know. Metro either do things a little differently or Intersango are about to be dragged off in chains.<br /><br />Incidentally anyone who ever wondered why you should bother paying for my service rather than going to an exchange you&#039;ll find the answer above /\...<br /><br />I need a lie down...<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s a charming idea Orinoko but the instant I start an exchange as they&#039;ve done, I&#039;d have to register a business bank account and the advantage to you, my cherished customers, of obtaining your Bitcoins in total anonymity would be lost as my arcane network of accounts I use to obtain my Bitcoins wouldn&#039;t stand up to that kind of scrutiny :-)<br /><br />Having said this I would be very interested in speaking to any vendors in the UK/EU who would be interested in selling their Bitcoins for cash as I want to have a beef up my emergency supply in case these problems with Intersango continue. I am currently doing this with two vendors in the EU where they send me Bitcoins they want sold and I mail them a fat wad of cash once a week, it&#039;s a very tidy arrangement and you don&#039;t have to rely on god awful banks... ;-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24376.msg366627#msg366627">Quote from: Orinoko Flow on July 24, 2012, 07:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Couldn&#039;t you start your own online bitcoin site Vladimir?&nbsp; Seems you could do a better job than intersango!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Even if it were frozen, would they not have noticed or been informed of it a bit earlier than today?<br />[/quote]<br /><br />None of this makes sense ; you see we&#039;re expressly forbidden under UK law to say when a client&#039;s account is under investigation... the only time a person&#039;s assets can be frozen is when there&#039;s proof that the money is dirty - which in the nature of things would be near nigh impossible surely?<br /><br />V.<br />[/quote]<br />[/quote]

				New support message from Intersango:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">While we were previously under the impression that the problems we were having with Metro bank were due to a technical issue on their end (as this has happened before), we have been told that our account activity is being reviewed and that we must be patient during this process. We have faith that our contact at Metro bank will properly investigate the matter. They have indicated that they do not require information from us at this time. The resolution time we were given was around 1 week, however this is just an approximation.<br /><br />We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused our userbase. We are doing everything we can to resolve the problem as fast as possible. In the future, we may not be able to accept payments quite as fast anymore to prevent fraud however we will work hard to decrease our resolution times for issues and make the experience of purchasing and selling bitcoins as easy for the UK as possible.<br /><br />We understand that many people have called Metro bank and Metro has told them that there is no issue. This is entirely incorrect. We believe it in not intentional it is simply that their support staff assumes that if there is not an issue affecting all accounts or a huge number of accounts at the bank that there is not an issue with our account.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep it&#039;s definitely over for them now.<br /><br />No account goes under &quot;activity review&quot;. The bank shut you down or allow you to carry on.<br /><br />As to their &quot;inside contact&quot; oh pleeeease. What are they? Friends with the bank manager? I use Metro Bank and it&#039;s a tiny company, they don&#039;t have any contacts there, unless it&#039;s someone working in their call center in the loft (roof room) of their Holborn branch.<br /><br />Get your money out now!

				Luckily they only have £25 of my money but their attitude has been atrocious.<br />At first on bitcoin talk they said &quot; if your deposit hasn&#039;t showed up you must of fucked up the reference number&quot;.<br />Now they are trying to say Metro have stopped processing their transactions. I don&#039;t know much about finance but it seems unlikely that a bank would do this to a business without warning? Because obviously it would fuck the business totally destroying its reputation?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever the outcome I predict that your bitcoins/cash business is going to experience a surge Vlad1m1r!&nbsp; :-)

				The no withdrawals from 26-30 th has being posted on their page for a month; they knew about it. I think it is separate from the current problems I don&#039;t know tho. There are some wild accusations going round forums, about the Britcoinicca fiasco. I don&#039;t know the details of that and what intersangos role was...wish I had payed morerr attention.<br />One thing I noticed was people complaining that&nbsp; they had lost 1000&#039;s of bitcoins. It makes me wonder why they were entrusting their life savings to a third party like that. Surely the beauty of bitcoins is you can take care of them yourself? If I had that much bitcoin it would be in offline cold wallets.

				Fuck, wish I had viewed that companies house listing before.<br /><br />As much as I want to hope that there&#039;s an innocent explanation (at best fraud investigation which is still kinda shit) the fact that it&#039;s 25/07/2012 and no withdrawls from 26th onwards meh Im worried.<br /><br />that said because they&#039;ve shown in the past that they don&#039;t operate particularly professionally (i.e. personal lives as an excuse for delays) I hope that maybe they re all busy filing accounts.&nbsp; but im not a mug it seems to reek<br /><br />does fact that they are registered with companies house mean that they are bound by their answer in their FAQ?<br /><br />&quot;Q. What happens if Intersango ends its business?<br />A. We do not see this as being a likely outcome as the continued operation of the site incurs minimal expenses. However, should a situation arise in which we must stop operating, deposits would be disabled and Intersango would continue to operate at our expense until all funds had been withdrawn.&quot;<br /><br />

Anyone who they owe money to would have the opportunity in a few years (we&#039;re talking like 7 to 10 years here) to register claims to the debt by the managers of their liquidation (their accountants) and their assets would then be sold off and split amongst the people who registered debt claims.<br /><br />There is two issues with this. Firstly they don&#039;t have any accountants as they haven&#039;t even listed them on their companies house page or filed any accounts yet, so noone to manage their estate.<br /><br />Secondly they have NO assets. Their &quot;office&quot; is a virtual office service which you can rent for £45 a month, where some girl answers the phone for them and thousands of other businesses and forwards their mail to them.<br /><br />Basically get your money out now or you&#039;re fucked. No point crying over spilt milk.<br /><br />As I&#039;ve talked about before I actually use Metro Bank for certain business banking purposes, and I&#039;m fairly close to my bank manager, so I&#039;m going to ask her about this tomorrow when I go to see her. She probably won&#039;t give me details, but will be able to call bullshit on the &quot;our account is under review&quot; line coming out of Intersango. Will report back.

Er....&quot;<br /><br />&quot;what?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;my £100?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh sorry I&#039;ve put it in the till.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well...

				Personally I need intersango to work. I cant be bothered learning the crap for mt and bit instant. I know its a fucker having coin tied up and not being able to use them. I took some money out, and it took a week, then tried to take some more out a week ago and it hasnt come through yet. I had bits in there and was able to send them to SR with no problems about 3 days ago. I need to get them out in cash tho. Once their system crashes they will start getting more and more emails till it just cant be dealt with, the whole thing backs up. Im praying that in a week they are back to normal. I need them. It was so easy when they were running, so easy, I love intersango, I will miss it badly if it goes.

				Has anyone got any idea based on evidence or knowledge what the chances of recovering funds from Intersango are now? I have been emailing them for ten days now and nothing at all has come back. There&#039;s all sorts of hearsay online, does anyone actually know what&#039;s happening?

				So with a little inside information and some basic logic I&#039;ve been able to piece together what&#039;s really happeneing at Intersango.<br /><br />It&#039;s a long story, but it goes like this.<br /><br />A few weeks ago HSBC got in deep shit with US regulators for being used by criminals to wire money worldwide with no checks or cautions, the US regulators turned up the heat on HSBC and the UK regulators big time and it&#039;s all being dragged through the courts at the moment.<br /><br />A few days back someone used Intersango to buy Bitcoins, they transferred via bank transfer UK GBP from their account into Intersango&#039;s Metro account. They got the money into Intersango successfully, got some Bitcoins then used those Bitcoins to buy some drugs.<br /><br />The drugs never turned up, so the person wanted their money back. They bitched to Metro bank that they had done a transfer into an account of theirs which was to pay someone to buy drugs and that it hadn&#039;t worked, so could they have their money back please? (They probably thought this would be funny, but hey it hasn&#039;t turned out that way).<br /><br />The shit hit the fan at Metro Bank, especially with the added heat from regulators they initially just froze but later infact completely closed Intersango&#039;s Metro bank account. This is why Intersango initially thought they were having temporary issues and then later on admitted they were being subject to a full investigation and it will take weeks.<br /><br />After a brief investigation Metro Bank were forced to hand information over to SOCA (The Serious Organized Crime Agency), the British equivalent of the FBI &amp; DEA combined. SOCA are now investigating and planning to bring charges of money laundering and assisting in the supply and sale of class A, B &amp; C substances contrary to the misuse of banned substances XYZ act (not sure exactly) against Intersango.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure whether the guy who originally bitched to Metro bank about loosing his money is complying with SOCA and this is why they&#039;re able to bring an investigation, my guess is probably yes, they must have got his IP or email address or something and traced it to him.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;ll keep you guys updated as things develop.<br /><br />It seems to me something like this was inevitable anyway. <br /><br />Also on a side note Intersango still haven&#039;t fulfilled their legal obligation to file their company accounts which were due on 25/07/2012, so now 3 days overdue:<br />http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/9858dc17db80d4d92f692dc3de29753c/compdetails<br /><br />Although considering their probably currently sweating in a Met Police cell, this doesn&#039;t really surprise me. Also I guess it would be pretty easy to file accounts when they currently stand at -£2 million (permanent SOCA wire transfer lol).

				So is intersango completely fucked then? and will it most likely go under? :/<br /><br />Used them for the past month with only a couple minor hitches in delayed deposits. Is LE likely to be gathering the account details of users of Intersango and able to make accusations of use of SR through Intersango?

I saw Patrick argue with someone who wanted to withdraw money and close account.

				You&#039;re right Vlad, the Intersango deposit records could provide an opening for law enforcement and they could make some progress if they had the inclination and the resources (which we must always assume they do).&nbsp; I suppose as a small buyer I&#039;m a little complacent, believing there to be many bigger fish than me who would be targeted first.

I work in a bank and we will regularly e-mail a spreadsheet (using public key cryptography) with details of all deposits and transfers to an account so if LEO do get hold of this information then it will be no more trouble for them to trace who has wired £1000 to Intersango&#039;s account than £1.<br /><br />Having said this I don&#039;t want to scare people needlessly&nbsp; - as you say in itself it wouldn&#039;t be enough to incriminate someone but used as intelligence to merit further investigation it could prove problematic for buyers - simple solution as I said is to make sure you obtain your BTC using a safe method, once again this doesn&#039;t necessarily mean using my service!<br /><br />One of Intersango&#039;s redeeming features is it does list legal suppliers of services like web design or products like T Shirts who offer discounts to people who pay in Bitcoin so that&#039;s one way to get hold of them. So if you have a cottage industry or just a skill you want to sell why not spread the word and obtain payment that way? :-)<br /><br />V.

				Thing that pisses me off is whenever Intersango have any problems with depositing or withdrawing funds, they never make it obvious on their home page. It&#039;s always buried somewhere in the support or account sections, so on first impressions one might think all is good. They are quick enough to take the money, but to slow to worn people if they are having any problems.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve nothing to worry about. No-one here&#039;s ever used Intersango to purchase Bitcoins for the purpose of buying drugs on-line, right?...&nbsp; ;)

If I stumble into their path they&#039;ll take the bust but I don&#039;t think they&#039; ll come looking for me.<br />Touch wood.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Many thanks to Rootzero for your comments.<br /><br />I think I may have mentioned this on another thread - I don&#039;t want to sound alarmist but the situation is a little different in theory and in practice.<br /><br />As RootZero rightly says in theory a court order is required however due to new powers under the Anti Terrorism act bank accounts can be frozen on a whim - although this was always the case this can now be done aribitrarily for personal bank accounts (Limetless and I think this is the kind of account the owners of Intersango use) and even when only small sums have moved in.<br /><br />However, the practice in my bank at least is that when the Police want financial information about an individual or company we give it to them (I find individuals are subject to closer scrutiny actually as Ltd Liability companies must publish and audit their accounts publicly in any case..).<br /><br />The reasoning the Police give is that if they had to apply for a warrant each time they suspected someone was acting suspiciously, investigations would slow to a snail&#039;s pace. Of course we never refer to such requests directly as ironically it&#039;s illegal for us to supply information in this way, even if it is to prevent a crime so we always refer to such as information requests as being from &quot;our friends&quot;. Obviously if any evidence of suspicious activity is found then the Police will go through the usual channels to make sure any information submitted is legally admissible as evidence.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t sure why they do this. My mentor who trained me to use the banking system anonymously (which incidentally allows me to use the exchanges safely!) says he thinks the top brass are worried our share prices will take a dive if it&#039;s revealed that we&#039;ve been subject to that kind of scrutiny- the situation with HSBC laundering money for Mexican cartels seems to bear out this theory(!)<br /><br />Finally, the Police do not always have to request such information. We are bound by law to log and document any suspicious account activity (mercifully I no longer have to do this!) and this is submitted in a standardised format to the Police. <br /><br />As far as I know we are not monitoring transfers from personal accounts to MtGox&#039;s Barclays account or Intersango&#039;s Metro account but I wouldn&#039;t be privy to that kind of information - also, just because they&#039;re not doing so at present doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t be doing so in future!<br /><br />The solution in my opinion would be to have an offshore exchange and I know certain more gifted members of our forum are currently working on this. It would be very easy to set up a business bank account here in the UK and then make a daily bulk transfer of funds to an offshore account - the actual amounts due to each person could then be e-mailed separately in encrypted CSV format.<br /><br />Of course as Schneier&#039;s Law says, anyone can imagine a system to secure that *they* can&#039;t think of any way to get round it and in my infinite modesty I still maintain my own system is safer. <br /><br />As long as bank accounts can be monitored and frozen in this way there&#039;s always going to be a demand both for an anonymous decentralised currency like the Bitcoin and physical money which cannot be traced nearly as easily. Long may they both last I say!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I&#039;d rather not go into details on here except to say you would need to work in a bank to accomplish this and the level of ingenuity required is very high (he himself mastered this technique after being with the bank about seven years). In addition all coins obtained in this way are run through SR&#039;s mixer before being sent on to the client though this is more for my benefit than the customers.<br /><br />Having said this less than a tenth of the Bitcoins I sell in this way are obtained from exchanges - you no doubt will have seen I have offered to help vendors to &quot;cash out&quot; and I have now set up a steady supply of Bitcoins from several vendors from all over the world.&nbsp; Since once again I pay cash to obtain their BTC my own identity is protected. The Bitcoins are transferred to me anonymously which I then once again sell for cash.<br /><br />I also sell Bitcoins I obtain from various investments such as mining pools - in fact a large amount of my personal portfolio is invested in mining rigs which make use of renewable energies. <br /><br />If you have any suggestions on how this could be made safer, please feel free to say so but as I said the fact that some of the coins I sell come from exchanges does not pose any risk to my clients.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

I&#039;m always open to suggestions from any user as to how I can improve the anonymity of the service but it would be virtually impossible to detect the transfers I&#039;ve made to exchanges from the myriad of bank accounts I&#039;ve used ; also this isn&#039;t your problem as you say because by then the coins have been transferred to you anonymously(!) I do want to rely on the banking system less though as it is too slow for the volumes of orders we&#039;re receiving.<br /><br />To answer your question -if you accept a package in your home containing contraband the Police would have the right to arrest you. This in turn allows them to search your premises, vehicle and person on arrest. A lot of scallywag Police have got into trouble in the past for arresting someone on a trumped up charge then trying to justify it after the fact with a search.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to sound alarmist as I&#039;ll just be accused of profiteering anyway but it&#039;s important to make it clear that while the risk is low, it&#039;s real, not theoretical. Also, a search of your house wouldn&#039;t be necessary to establish you&#039;d bought Bitcoins by going to an exchange, a peek at Intersango&#039;s records would establish that from the comfort of our favourite pork chop&#039;s desk.

Especially during the current economic climate and their 20% budget cuts they&#039;re focusing only on the big fish. They may trace the transactions, but only to be used as evidence against the big fish in court, they won&#039;t worry about the small fry. It costs a huge amount of money to do all that surveillance and monitoring, even for one person, it&#039;s simply not worth it.<br /><br />The police in the UK aren&#039;t even interested in people who buy drugs, even class A drugs, and even in large quantities, as long as they know you aren&#039;t reselling it.

The fucking (British) customs busted me for having an 8th of hash on a train to Dublin once. Took me off, strip searched me, looked up the arse, charged me with attempting to export an illegal substance ffs. Made me sound like Pablo Escobar. Got a fine and 5 year record. So remember the International element to this. Getting caught receiving a gram of something from abroad is several crimes at once and a dead handy collar to add to some copper&#039;s success rate. Possession, importation, conspiracy, fuck knows what else. Good way to turn some people into touts as well. I take the point that UK cops are under major budgetary pressure at the minute but the post office would be doing the screening at the sorting offices. Results- tons of dead easy collars.

				Well since this fiasco started, I&#039;ve moved all my Bitcoin banking away from Intersango and over to Mt. Gox and I don&#039;t know why I was ever using Intersango.<br /><br />Mt. Gox have been amazing. It&#039;s true you have to verify your account, which is a pain in the ass. I had to upload about 5 utility bills and council tax bills and my passport and driving license, then even that wasn&#039;t good enough so I had to post them copies, but eventually they verified me. I suppose it took just over a week total.<br /><br />Next I had to verify my bank account with them which took another few days (It&#039;s just a normal UK bank account, I chose my RBS one for this). I had to verify my IBAN number which took them a couple of days, but now allows me to do 1 hour deposits and withdrawals from my RBS to Mt. Gox and vice versa, I can use £ Pounds, Euros, $ Dollars, whatever I want, and they rarely take longer than an hour. Sometimes if it&#039;s weekend or night then I have to wait until 6am the next morning, but sure enough it&#039;s always there. I can literally have someone give me 100 Bitcoins, and have that sitting in my UK bank account in British Pounds £ within an hour and also the other way round, from my UK account to my Bitcoin wallet. Obviously this is only on working days, not the weekend.<br /><br />I always thought the IBAN transfers were going to take ages, days or weeks, but they don&#039;t. Once you&#039;ve got everything set up with your IBAN number, SWIFT &amp; BIC stuff and branch per-approval you can receive and send stuff as fast as UK to UK.<br /><br />I did have a couple of issues with the first transaction I did, which were my mistake, because I forgot I can&#039;t withdraw dollars to my UK bank account, so RBS chucked the transaction back to Gox, but Mt. Gox were so helpful, messaging me all the time with updates and explaining everything thoroughly, I never had to wait more than 10 mins for a reply. A lot of people complain about their support, but there&#039;s one person who always seems to deals with me, called &quot;Gina&quot; and she&#039;s great.<br /><br />I suppose the only downside to Mt. Gox is that their website is a bit confusing, it&#039;s clearly made for other companies and resellers, it&#039;s not very user friendly for individual users.<br /><br />Anyway when Intersango come back online I won&#039;t ever be using them again. I used to love them, and give them compliments all the time in the forum here, but now they can get lost!!<br /><br />

Soon hopefully we&#039;ll have an offshore exchange which people can use in the UK but until then I&#039;d be happy to service anyone who needs BTC.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi Vlad,<br /><br />just joined the forum, and have been looking for a reliable U.K BC source....I&#039;mCheers signed up with Bitstamp, but from reading your vendor page u can transfer straight into SR wallet, which is great.<br /><br />Just a couple of things, should i go with RM recorded...would of thought that might avoid any sticky fingered posties, and second what rate do u offer/commission?

				Well it&#039;s now the 31st and two things:<br /><br />A) They&#039;ve still got the error message at the bottom saying they can&#039;t do bank transfer&#039;s until the 30th<br /><br />and<br /><br />B) They still haven&#039;t filed their annual accounts with Companies House, which they are legally obliged to do. If they leave it any longer, not only will they get fined but they will get short prison sentences too. Their accountant must be in deep shit too, he&#039;d be struck off from being a chartered accountant, oh wait they dont have one!&nbsp; ;D

				Both accounts. Mine was £100 to, They seem to respond to tickets eventually but that doesnt count for nothing if we dont get our money back.&nbsp; This was there latest response to me <br />Hi,<br /><br />While our bank was not reporting all payments to us they were also not allowing us to send payments out. We could not send payments out even if we wanted to. Not only that if we were to send payments out to users who we could not verify had even sent us payments in the first place, we would have been abused and we would be risking our user&#039;s payments.<br /><br />Our bank has started passing payments through our site. Unfortunately buying bitcoins is not the easiest thing and no one has successfully managed to provide as good of service as us in the UK. We have spent a fortune to be able to have sub par banking.<br /><br />Our new banking is far better than when we were backing with Lloyds and HSBC. There was a 3 week period about 5 or so months ago I believe where we were unable to process payments.<br /><br />We expect to catch up with all issues within the next few days. Especially for payments out we are limited due to daily withdraw limits. We are sorry for the inconvenience.<br /><br />We hope that this recent account investigation which seems to have successfully passed will give us more credit in the future.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Team Intersango<br /><br />They say the investigation is over but i still don&#039;t have my money. Shall find somewhere else to purchase bit coins in the future.

				&nbsp;Tbh if they get their act together I will continue to use them until something better comes along; simply because I could transfer funds to them and have my coins in an hour or so. When it was working their service was pretty good. They&#039;ve not done them selves any favours with their attitude over this problem though. That&#039;s if it&#039;s all legit; there&#039;s suggestions flying about that they&#039;ve been playing silly buggers with other peoples money, and the £100 min deposit for new customers is to be used ponzi style to pay earlier depositors. I don&#039;t think that makes much sense tho cos no one is going to give them money until people start getting deposits showing up and withdrawals working.

				Yeah but still no update on there site/status. On here and bitcointalk it seems to be the same kinda posts coming from people that there money is clearing (im not saying its people from here). I spoke with Patrick last night and he was very stressed as I can imagine. He said things will be back to normal in 12-36 hours then I read (at the same time) it would be 24-48 hours ? I mean come on ?? <br /><br />He then got VERY stroppy with me and said if I keep asking questions ill get banned ? This is the guy I was toldd to speak to. <br /><br />I paid the 23rd, does that mean im in there &quot;New&quot; policy of a week&nbsp; wait? <br /><br />ALL I WANT IS MY £100 in my account ASAP !!<br /><br />:(

				I understand where your coming from rabrye, the way they handled this whole situation has been awful... automated replys to tickets, no communication on the site and letting people keep depositing even though all this was going on.<br /><br />Sadly Intersango is a really important part of the UK bitcoin economy and if they had gone into liquidation like alot of people were saying it would done alot of damage to bitcoin in the UK and the price of coin would have taken a large hit like when bitcoinica went down a few months back.<br />I was freaking out myself until last night when my money appeared so just chill for abit and im sure it&#039;ll turn up soon along with everyone elses :)

				Well I can safely say I won&#039;t be using Intersango ever again they seem a pretty shit 2 bit operation at best.<br /><br />Im glad people have started to get their funds back, but seriously, wake up folks, they have not filed accounts, they have said min deposits of £100 with a holding period, this does not smell right.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you get your cash/coins I would move them off asap.<br /><br />I assumed that no one would see their money again fortunetly it seems that people will get them, but I think people should take this as a warning, something seems very wrong with intersango.<br /><br />Vlad I think u&#039;ll be getting some mail mate. :D

				Fired off a very angry response after they closed yet another ticket of mine without resolving my issues.<br /><br />Vlad &amp; Rootzero when did u send them the funds?<br /><br />This is the part that angered me the most seeing as I&#039;m aware that you guys got funds<br /><br />&quot;We are still having problems with our bank account which we hope will be resolved tomorrow.<br /><br />We have updated our status page to reflect the current status of our UK payment issues. We are happy to say the investigation seems to have ended favourably however we are still waiting on the resolution of a technical issue with Metro bank.<br /><br />link to their status <br /><br />We will update the status once the issue has been resolved or we have further information. If your issue has not been imported after the status says that it should be imported then please reopen this ticket. There is nothing to worry about but at that point. If you do not see your payment the reference code may have not been passed along correctly due to user error or incongruent banking standards. &quot;<br /><br />Any answers from them about why they&#039;ve not submitted company accounts?<br /><br />This still seems really fishy to me.

				Latest statement from intersango:<br /><br /><br />A recent investigation by our UK bank (Metro bank) into our bank account halted our ability to accept and send payments out. Non GBP payment aspects of Intersango were also indirectly effected due to workload. We are working hard to catch up with these issues and hope to have everything running smoothly within the next 24 to 48 hours. We are deeply sorry for all the inconvenience this has caused.<br /><br />While the issue started on the 15th or the 16th as best we can tell, we were not told about the account limitation until the 20th or 21st. Depending on the type of investigation Metro bank conducted, they may legally have the obligation to have kept secret the investigation and the limitations on our account, we are not sure.<br /><br />On the 30th, we received an email stating:<br /><br />&quot;The Intersango Ltd account with Metro Bank is now fully operational, our initial enquiries having been completed.&quot;<br /><br />We take this as a sign that the investigation went favourably and we hope that this will give us more credibility with both Metro bank and our users. Unfortunately, our inability to conduct business during this time has certainly hurt our business.<br /><br />While we have been told that our account is fully operational, we still cannot access all the data we need. We have experienced this same issue 3 times before with Metro bank and it has been deemed a technical error.<br /><br />We contacted Metro bank today regarding the issue at 8AM when they opened and we were told that the issue was passed on to the tech department. Unfortunately, we have yet to hear back. We will attempt to call tomorrow again at 8AM. In the past, the exact same issue has always been fixable.<br /><br />Our UK bank issues have resulted in a plethora of tickets which will be all answered in time. For now, all pending_review payments should have cleared. All issues regarding manual administrator assistance are being taken care of as well. Many of the larger outgoing BTC payments were not processed due to an emptying of the live wallet however we hope to rectify the matter tonight.<br /><br />We are sorry for the inconvenience and hope to catch up with all the tickets and issues which have resulted in the next 24 to 48 hours however we need to wait for Metro bank&#039;s resolution of their technical issue for UK related payments.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Team Intersango<br /><br />I&#039;m still waiting for the larger of my two deposits. When the fiver showed up I started getting my hopes up!

Non GBP payment aspects of Intersango were also indirectly effected due to workload. We are working hard to catch up with these issues and hope to have everything running smoothly within the next 24 to 48 hours. We are deeply sorry for all the inconvenience this has caused.<br /><br />While the issue started on the 15th or the 16th as best we can tell, we were not told about the account limitation until the 20th or 21st. Depending on the type of investigation Metro bank conducted, they may legally have the obligation to have kept secret the investigation and the limitations on our account, we are not sure.<br /><br />On the 30th, we received an email stating:<br /><br />&quot;The Intersango Ltd account with Metro Bank is now fully operational, our initial enquiries having been completed.&quot;<br /><br />We take this as a sign that the investigation went favourably and we hope that this will give us more credibility with both Metro bank and our users. Unfortunately, our inability to conduct business during this time has certainly hurt our business.<br /><br />While we have been told that our account is fully operational, we still cannot access all the data we need. We have experienced this same issue 3 times before with Metro bank and it has been deemed a technical error.<br /><br />We contacted Metro bank today regarding the issue at 8AM when they opened and we were told that the issue was passed on to the tech department. Unfortunately, we have yet to hear back. We will attempt to call tomorrow again at 8AM. In the past, the exact same issue has always been fixable.<br /><br />Our UK bank issues have resulted in a plethora of tickets which will be all answered in time. For now, all pending_review payments should have cleared. All issues regarding manual administrator assistance are being taken care of as well. Many of the larger outgoing BTC payments were not processed due to an emptying of the live wallet however we hope to rectify the matter tonight.<br /><br />We are sorry for the inconvenience and hope to catch up with all the tickets and issues which have resulted in the next 24 to 48 hours however we need to wait for Metro bank&#039;s resolution of their technical issue for UK related payments.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Team Intersango<br /><br />I&#039;m still waiting for the larger of my two deposits. When the fiver showed up I started getting my hopes up!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />...honestly and people tell me they think my cash in the mail service is unreliable. Touching wood, I haven&#039;t lost a single package yet!<br /><br />V. <br /><br />

				When my money came through three days ago my choices were to try to withdraw through the bank that had apparently frozen their assets in the first place our buy Bitcoins at a price of £6.29 each when the Bitcoin was trading for £6.14 on MtGox - needless to say I have chosen the Bitcoins and they are safely tucked away in the stock exchange.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if anyone found my previous post conceited but you wouldn&#039;t believe the number of messages I get from people saying &quot;Oh, why shouldn&#039;t we just go to Intersango?&quot; :-)<br /><br />V.

				I agree totally with everyone&#039;s concerns about Intersango. I&#039;ve only recently opened an account with them, and now that my initial money has finally been cleared today, I&#039;ve now withdrawn it all as Bitcoins into SR... and I will NOT be using Intersango again. It&#039;s taken about 7 emails to their Support pages, and finally a separate email to their support@intersango.com address. I&#039;ve not actually had any reply to this last email sent yesterday, but miraculously, my account was credited when I checked this morning - so perhaps the backlog is finally clearing. However, appalling customer service all round.

				It&#039;s a shame because there is no better or quicker service available for people in the UK to obtain BTC when they are running smoothly. But I have to say, I&#039;ll be giving them a wide while this is going on and have looked to alternatives, but they are just not as convenient for me as using Intersango.

However given that their own bank can arbitrarily freeze their account at any time and given the strong possibility that the whole company&#039;s been run from some teen&#039;s bedroom I&#039;d say look to the alternatives - that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that everyone has to use my service of course, we&#039;ve seen localbitcoins already, Craigslist will also sometimes list them.<br /><br />V.

				So whats happening with intersango today? I have been able to put bits into intersango and take bits out again to SR the whole time. The problem was withdrawing £s. I put a withdrawal in ages ago and it never cleared and Ive been waiting ever since, almost a month.<br /><br />Some people have stared to see things happening but has anyone had a withdrawal of £s arrive. <br /><br />I love intersango, they are the best, even with the recent problems. When they are running smoothly it is the best service for me, so easy, hassle free, totally great. Its been a nightmare this last month, but hopefully they will be running smoothly again. <br /><br />When every single customer sends 10 emails a day then thats it, the whole thing shuts down. It amazes me reading &#039;they havnt replied to 10 emails&#039; why keep sending them then? They ended up shutting the message thing down coz they couldnt deal with it. <br /><br />I love them, even with the recent problems, as long as it all gets sorted out then Im fine. If it turns out they were scamming everyone all along then I will quietly remove this post and start writing posts that say &#039;I knew it all along&#039;.

The only delays I&#039;ve ever had in my service was when I used to rely on Intersango for some of the coins I sold to customers. I&#039;ve moved operations away from them entirely now, they&#039;re just a liability - Metro bank are just punching above their weight, they&#039;re simply not well established enough to stand up to organisations like SOCA.<br /><br />V.

				EZ Vlad.....I totally hear you on the advantages of using the cash in post service and yes it is I believe a small price to pay for the anon nature. I just take the stance of &#039;oh they would not be interested in lil old me as just a smallish buyer&#039; which is foolish, but I feel is correct. I only intended originally to buy a few random things every now n then off SR, but this has escalated and I do buy pretty frequently so I think it&#039;s about time I did a security audit and perhaps change my ways of doing certain processes to allow more safe use of SR and in it for the long haul!!! I may well be in touch Vlad bruv..... :)

Bonus!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Geedog,<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure Intersango will go back to the same day credit service but even if they do if they could get locked down at any time, it&#039;s a hell of a risk to take with your money!<br /><br />I appreciate that my service does cost more than going via MtGox but I try to emphasise security over convenience - yes of course if you might only get £180 rather than £200 for my service for instance but the advantage is that you don&#039;t have to wire money from your own bank account to buy the Bitcoins, thus leaving a permanent paper trail, which will show anyone with access to your bank/Mtgox&#039;s records that you have bought them.<br /><br />You can mitigate this risk slightly by running your coins through a mixer such as Bitcoinfog but it will always be possible to prove you originally purchased the coins and I imagine you can do without that kind of attention, particularly if you&#039;re in the dock trying to explain that you had absolutely no idea what was in that package when you signed for it :-) - my commission is a small price to pay for your peace of mind!<br /><br />In any case, I&#039;ve decided to cut Intersango out altogether from my service. This is the third time they&#039;ve screwed up, my clients deserve better!<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why dont you run a cheaper wire transfer service?<br /><br />Personally Im more concerned with turn around time that anonymity.<br /><br />The postal service is over the top for my needs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />After what&#039;s happened to Intersango, you can easily answer your own question! Bank accounts imply centralisation, which in turn implies regulation which means not only can the account be shut down on a whim but any fool with access to the bank&#039;s records will be able to see who has been buying Bitcoin. As you know I work in a bank myself and have fielded enquiries like these from Police in the past.<br /><br />Cash in the mail cannot be regulated in the same way as there&#039;s no obvious way to determine the sender by monitoring the receiver&#039;s address. LEO could even open the envelopes (as they have done on occasion), and it would do them no good as all they&#039;d see is cash and an order number, which has no significance to anyone except myself and the customer.<br /><br />The turnaround time is important too - I like to think I run a fairly right ship as an extra one or two working days isn&#039;t too much to ask for the kind of safety you&#039;ll receive but I wonder if focusing on speed over safety is approaching the issue from the right end? It takes more time to learn how to encrypt your address with GPG after all but it&#039;s still a very good idea to do so!<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, I&#039;m done with Sango anyway now.....I know it&#039;s safer all round to use your service Vlad but I bet 75% of people on this site use MtGox or Intersango, unless they use the moneypak thing in the US etc....<br /><br />Like I say, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll pay your store a visit soon enough dude! :)

It would be much easier to tackle the problem from the other end by monitoring the mail at random and marrying it up with an exchange&#039;s records like I said. I don&#039;t want to cause anyone to panic as certainly in my own bank (which has been around for considerably longer than Metro!) I&#039;m not aware of us specifically monitoring transfers to Bitcoin exchanges but then again I wouldn&#039;t need to be told this as I&#039;m working in a different department these days. :-)<br /><br />V.

Gox takes 2-3 days to get your money but at least they are reliable...<br /><br />Been speaking to a few exchangers on the bitcointalk forum to try find someone who does cheap gbp &gt; btc trades, the people I spoke to warned me not to use Intersango anymore as they may be going down soon, don&#039;t know if these claims are true but thought i&#039;d let everyone know.<br />Also found this yesterday http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/bitcoinica-users-sue-for-460k-in-lost-bitcoins/ which may have something to do with it as the guys who run Intersango are the same guys that owned Bitcoinica and some people are still waiting on hundreds of thousands $ worth of coins from there security hack that happened back in May.<br /><br />It might just be rumors going around but I wanted to let everyone know as i&#039;d hate to see silk road members losing there money to the muppets that run Intersango.

				I agree too, I&#039;ve taken all my business away from Sango.<br /><br />The way they handled the recent incident was absolutely awful, possibly the worst way it could have been dealt with. Some of the complete nonsense they were spouting to me in my support tickets was totally unbelievable.<br /><br />I think their wallet got emptied recently causing even more problems for some.<br /><br />My advice is stay well away from them.<br /><br />They are completely unprofessional and there is a lot of negative speculation going on all over the btc forums about their looming demise. They may be quicker when they work, but when it goes wrong you&#039;re left in limbo with excuses that don&#039;t add up.<br /><br />Gox seem better, slow, but better rates too. Not 100% clear on their charging structure though.<br /><br />Currently investigating RL vendors listed on sites like https://localbitcoins.com/ (more on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Local.2FIn-Hand_Exchanges )<br /><br />Would love to do it myself, if I had a shop or convenience store nearby it would be ace, might be worth asking your local store if they would get involved.

				I deposited money in to their account whilst these problems were still ongoing, luckily it was toward the end&nbsp; of the problems and within the next two days I had my deposits showing up and got my Bitcoins. They seem shady as fuck to me and weren&#039;t they involved with that bitcoinica website which was hacked and people lost massive amounts of money? According to some clearnet forums, they aren&#039;t interested in their customers and are holding back on issueing claims.?<br /><br />I wont be using them again.
