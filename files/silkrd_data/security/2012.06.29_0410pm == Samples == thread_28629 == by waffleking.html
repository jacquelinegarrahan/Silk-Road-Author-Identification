				Recently there have been a lot of new potential vendors popping up and offering free samples.&nbsp; &nbsp;No harm there, but I&#039;ve noticed in the forums that a lot of people requesting samples are established vendors and go out of their way to point this out. <br /><br />If you were LE and wanted to collect the addresses of some vendors rather than buyers, you would now have a great collection of vendor addresses with pretty minimal effort. <br /><br />Hope this doesn&#039;t fall into the tin hat category.&nbsp; Just want everyone to stay safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I&#039;m pretty sure there is a post right on SR telling vendors to not use their vendor accounts for purchases.&nbsp; Should be the same for claiming samples, right?

				They would also be committing Entrapment. That&#039;s why they send other people into a drug house to make a buy and when they set up fake prostitutes they never offer service they have to wait until the John makes an offer. They would actually have to ship you illegal substance for you to get busted for possession.

				I don&#039;t think this is about entrapment.&nbsp; If LE can locate and/or identify a vendor, they could presumably then catch him in the act of packaging or mailing product.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think that would be entrapment.

				It would only be entrapment if they tried to arrest them for possession of the sample. If they simply got the address of a vendor by saying they would send him a sample, then raided him on the grounds that he is an SR vendor who gave them his address then he&#039;d be pretty fucked.

				Buyers need to beware as well. It seems that trolls--possibly of LE origin--have been offering up free samples only to post the prospective buyer&#039;s address. In case anyone hasn&#039;t noticed, there&#039;s a thread containing an address atop this very forum (security) as well as a few others. If you view the OP&#039;s posts, you&#039;ll see that he offered free samples prior to posting that address. No one is going to break down your door for this (well at least not LE), though it can serve as a deterrent to free sample seekers if they keep it up.
