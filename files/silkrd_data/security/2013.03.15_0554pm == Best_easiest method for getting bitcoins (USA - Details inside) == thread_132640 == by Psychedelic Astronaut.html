				So, I really need a new reliable way to get bitcoins.&nbsp; I used Bitinstant cash &gt; btc addy up until everything started going haywire with them.&nbsp; Bitfloor and&nbsp; BlueSkyTraders are out the window for me because there is only 1 BoA within 6 hours of me.&nbsp; Also, anything requiring a Chase bank could possibly be a last resort, but would not be preferred.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve used Ziggap successfully twice, but they seem to have fairly regular issues of their own and are still really new. <br /><br />Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated, this is the only thing holding me back from making more purchases! :(

				If you have a Wells Fargo branch nearby, you could try using Bitcopia. I&#039;ve never had any problems with them.

				Trust me, you want the best way and not the easiest way.&nbsp; After using several methods, Dwolla -&gt; Mtgox is indubitably the way to go.&nbsp; The only drawback is having to get verified with mtgox, but this only takes 10 days at the most.&nbsp; Once you&#039;re through, it only costs 25 cents from the transfer.&nbsp; Whereas with other methods you&#039;re going to consistently be losing anywhere from 2 to 5 percent of your moolah!

				If you use Dwolla and/or MtGox to purchase bitcoins you have to send them through a good scrubber/obfuscator service to eliminate their connection to your identity. That costs a bit more and takes longer. Cash is king.

Gox).&nbsp; And, Cryptocurrent is great, but I wouldn&#039;t overnight cash, unless you really have no other options, just because Express Mail is so much more expensive than Bitfloor, for example.<br /><br />Finally, I wouldn&#039;t make a habit out of buying directly into your SR account.&nbsp; I know a lot of SR veterans do it, and maybe this is just me being overcautious.&nbsp; But, if you don&#039;t want to pay for a service like Bitcoin Fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/), and it&#039;s a small fee, at least buy your coins into an instawallet or something, and then maybe bounce a third into another instawallet then to SR, then a third to yet another instawallet&gt;SR, etc., over a couple of hours.&nbsp; A poor man&#039;s laundry service, if you will.&nbsp; Because we honestly don&#039;t know what the DEA knows about the Road, and while we have a certain amount of faith that SR encrypts the addresses it makes available to its customers, or generates them in a logically impossible way to trace back to it, we do know that once unencrypted, BTC addresses can be tracked.&nbsp; So, routing your coins through a few addresses gives you deniability if someone ever tries to accuse you of buying off the Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just sayin&#039;...
