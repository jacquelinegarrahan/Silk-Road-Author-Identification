				What are your guy&#039;s thoughts on what will happen to the value of bitcoins when it&#039;s halving difficulty is increased in the next (predicted) few days?<br /><br />Obviously there is no golden answer, just a curiosity on what other&#039;s might think will happen to it&#039;s value, will people dump their BTC&#039;s? Stock up on BTC before the difficulty increase? No change at all?<br /><br />I honestly have no opinion on what, it anything will occur, I was never paying attention to market trends when past block difficulty increases occurred.<br /><br />Interested to hear what people&#039;s opinions/conspiracies/etc. are.

				There are several threads about this on bitcoin.org. You might want to read them.<br /><br />The value of bitcoins is determined by the supply-demand ratio. If more people sell bitcoins than buy them, the value goes down and vice versa. Halving the mining reward doesn&#039;t affect that. Also, this isn&#039;t some unexpected event. People have known about it since the beginning and have been able to plan accordingly, so there shouldn&#039;t be a drastic change in buy/sell behavior in the next few days. <br /><br />By this straight forward logic, the value of bitcoins shouldn&#039;t be affected by the halving of the mining reward. Of course, it can change for other reasons.

				My guess is difficulty will decrease. BUT each block will only contain 25btc. so half the rewards. <br /><br /><br />We&#039;ll see how it pans out.<br /><br />

				IMO it will make the price shoot up even more rapidly than before. At least, that&#039;s what Miss Cleo said.

				Wish I had more BTC in the market in the case that it&#039;s value increases substantially, but alas, being an experimenting drug user they disappear quickly to vendor&#039;s on SR :P<br /><br />On the flip side of the coin, who knows the value might plummet, in which case i&#039;d be glad I spent most of my BTCs heh

				I think the price may jump up a little, and&nbsp; and go up more as time goes on. The sharp drops/corrections that we&#039;ve seen lately will be even more pronounced.
