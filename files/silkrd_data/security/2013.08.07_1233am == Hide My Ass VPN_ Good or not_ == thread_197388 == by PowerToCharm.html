				Some things I have learned from their Web site:<br /><br />Headquartered in Great Britain<br /><br />Supports open VPN protocol<br /><br />Accepts bitcoin for payment<br /><br />Requires email address for registration<br /><br />Logs username and IP for each session (though IP would be masked if accessing through Tor, correct?)<br /><br />Compatible with Windows and Mac (so could not be used with Tails, correct?)<br /><br />Is this any good? Or should we keep looking? Grateful for any insight from knowledgeable users.

				I think it was specifically Recursion who was the hacker who got busted from HMA directly. Sabu and others were caught in different ways. Sabu forgot to log onto his VPN before he logged into IRC and broadcasted his real hostname which was his personal Internet service (He lived in an apt complex in NY could he not just jack someone elses) He also had a website of his renew in his real name about the same time as the bust. He was sloppy IMO. Talented and intelligent but it doesn&#039;t make sense to be that sloppy.

				I personally cannot stand the customer service at HMA.<br /><br />Their service was great years ago. The last time I tried their service a year ago it horrible. If they started answering customer support inquiries I might change my mind, but they made me feel like as soon as they had my money they could offer zero customer service....needless to say I chose NOT to renew my service.

				They lied about keeping logs in the lulzsec debacle and handed over their customer to the gov&#039;t no problem then. They will do it again.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs!

				VPN is not save, The NSA is tapping in on VPN&#039;s too.<br /><br />Otherwise you are right, you use tor so from begin to end are you&nbsp; encrypted. Onionsites only. From tor to the clearnet will not encrypt. Tor hasn&#039;t be safe from the day it was made. Every time they say the last one is save , there are new holes found, so the last TorBrowserbundle is never the last. And even if Tor itself is safe then gpg can give your mac-address away, so the guys from LE still know who you are.<br /><br />VPN&#039;s are not safe, so don&#039;t spend money on them. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think the fbi knows what the NSA knows. <br />If the NSA knows that you like to smoke a joint, you are no threath to nationalsecurity. If the FBI wants something to know they have to ask google or the ISP and if they don&#039;t get it they have to get a court order. But if they ask nicely google gives. In 2% they say no.<br /><br />I am from the Netherlands and know that the MID the military intell division, knew where 5000 kilo of hashish was, but did not share that info with the police.<br />The 5000 keys were no threat for the national security, not from a military point of view.<br />The work hardly together. Beside and along each-other but nit with each-other.<br /><br />Taking DPR is a higher priority then to get SR from internet. DPR would make a new better market-site. I think DPR is a she. I think She will get a very high punishment, if not the capital one. If She is in Washington-state they will t put her on trial in California, just so she can be put to death.<br /><br />And afterwards you can say, you just bought the gear for a other. Never touched it saw it or used it. You don&#039;t answer for who it was. If it was your neighbor you could tell the judge, but he can not ask of you to rat on on brother , father or mother, so you keep your mouth shut.<br /><br />If SR is off-line we will go to BMR, and find our way always.<br /><br />Drifting.. (I am very stoned)<br /><br />Back on topic there is no good vpn, but HMA has a very bad reputation about giving away your privacy.<br /><br />Personally if there is no good VPN, all are just as worse as the vpn from HMA.<br />They do not function, the NSA is tapping in and copies everything.<br />No matter what vpn you use.<br />A waste of money.<br /><br />All who have paid should sew those vpn providers and demand their money back.<br />

				Look for a VPN that is not in Europe or the US, and that accepts payment in bitcoin and doesn&#039;t require you to provide anything in therms of information, not even an email address. Naturally, sign up through tor.<br /><br />Search and ye shall find.<br /><br />Then for cleanet launch tor and then VPN through tor. For hidden services, launch VPN first, then launch tor. Yes, I know that in this last case, the VPN will know your ip, but you can&#039;t have everything. That&#039;s why a VPN is not the ultimate in security, no matter which one you get.<br /><br />goblin
