				I have a guy in a legit casino that makes them look like winning for a really low fee, I was wondering is it really necessary? Or am I just being paranoid? I rather pay the small fee and sleep loudly at night.<br /><br />Just to clarify what we do is I &quot;wager&quot; with them and receive them back as coins with the casino backing me up as if I won them.

				Bigger gun as in how big? I think any decent amount of money (+5k a month) is bound to attract SOME attention, wouldn&#039;t some people get curious as to where you get that money from?<br /><br />Of course you could just say you make a profit from currency trading but that would be a very very complicated lie. My method seems to work way better and of course I can even tell my family where all that money comes from.

				If you are making 5k a month in BTC&nbsp; then you definitely need to launder your coins. I&#039;d say your casino method is a good move but how long can you do it before it doesn&#039;t really seem like plausible deniability?

				This is not hard people.. Go to www.coinabul.com and buy gold.<br /><br />BTC into a very negotiable asset without ever touching the banking system at any point. <br /><br />Once it&#039;s hard metal you hang onto it or sell it as your needs dictate. No AML, no SARs, because you are swapping commodity for a commodity.&nbsp;
