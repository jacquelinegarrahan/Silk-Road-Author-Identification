				I have a project I&#039;m working on and would like pick the great minds here on SR<br /><br />I&#039;m in the USA. I want to create and host an english clearnet website in a foreign country. Looking for best methods/practices. Areas of caution I need to be aware of. And possibly hiring someone to do the work.<br /><br />I want to create a website that sells products. I want the website to be hosted in a foreign country where USA LE will have a hard time reaching out to the hosting company and shutting down the website. I want the website to have a shopping cart format with pictures, prices in BTC, reviews section. Is this a feasible project?<br /><br />Thanks for any constructive comments!

				Panama, Russia, Malaysia. Three countries who have some hosts that allow drug forum hosting and ignore complaints about them anyway. They probably will not tolerate a full fledged massive drug marketplace like SR though, cept maybe some of the Russians might.

				What I&#039;d do:<br /><br />Find at least two hosting companies and a registrar that deal in BTC or work with anonymous top-up credit cards, make your site incredibly cache-friendly and have your front-end website be a VPS which runs nothing but a Tor / I2P relay and a caching server.<br /><br />If your front-end is seized then nobody can find out who you are or where the service is really hosted, if it&#039;s shut down then you just switch your DNS to a backup proxy.<br /><br />Your main attack vector would be having your DNS seized, which is more likely the more infamous you are. So I suggest picking a TLD in a country which doesn&#039;t give a fuck about such things.
