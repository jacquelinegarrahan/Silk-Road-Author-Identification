				Hello all, I finally recieved my coin today! :) I proceeded to send my coin to my block chain wallet address. Right when I clicked send, my bitcoins dissapeared. I refreshed the blockchain wallet page and the coin showed up like instantly. Pretty happy that I didnt mess that up. After my coin was in my block chain wallet, I logged onto SR, clicked my account, and went to make a deposit. Clicked that and a little window came up telling me about my PIN and displayed the address to send my coin from block chain to. I copied the address it showed. I then went back to block chain, clicked send money, entered the amount I wanted to send, and pasted the address that SR gave me where it was asking where to send it to. After I did that I went back to SR, refreshed my account page, but my balance still showed 0.00(BTC). <br /><br />I refreshed it a couple times and still 0.00. Do deposits into the SR wallet usually take a while? Did I just lose my bitcoin and send them into some random ass internet address or did I do good? Will they show up in a little bit?

				Yeah, don&#039;t worry about it. The average time is usually right around an hour to transfer from 1 address to another. You will need 6 confirmation before the BTC will show up in your SR wallet.<br /><br />I have found that on weekends the times can be much quicker, I&#039;ve had it take less than 20 minutes during the weekend, but the average seems to be around 40 minutes for me.

				If you find the transaction that contained the bitcoins on blockchain.info, they&#039;ll usually arrive in your SR wallet when it says 7 confirmations, so on average that&#039;s 1 hour and ten minutes.
