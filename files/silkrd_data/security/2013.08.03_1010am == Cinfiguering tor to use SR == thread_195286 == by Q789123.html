				I recently purchased a second hand dell to use for business. Although TOR went OK- SR just would not come, no matter how long and hard i tried.<br /><br />So I went to my local repair shop, chose the young man I know who seems ok and explained it to him.<br />You see i need sleeping pils as I work night shifts in remote areas- RIGHT?<br />Anyone, he knows SR, said &#039;Yeh sure mate- no worries&#039;. So 2 hours and $120 later- WAMMO SR IS UP.<br />I asked him what he did and he just said he&#039; tweeked&#039; the laptop a bit.<br /><br />My question is WHAT DID HE DO? I don&#039;t want to go back and ask again.<br /><br />&nbsp;I want to do it to my other laptops and not pay $120<br /><br />Can anyone tell me what he did?<br /><br />I have another 2 laptops- neither can get through to SR- what is the secret?<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />Q<br /><br />

				Wait ... you&#039;re saying you took the computer to a repair person and asked them to set it up so you could order drugs from Silk Road?&nbsp; Um ... not sure what to say here ...<br /><br />All that&#039;s necessary to access SR is Tor / Tor Browser Bundle ... <br /><br />But I would be seriously concerned about your setup if you literally told the guy you were trying to get on Silk Road to order drugs, left the computer with him, and then all he told you was that he &quot;tweaked it&quot; ...

				Well I disagree, I have two laptops that can easily get onto tormail- yet can&#039;t get onto SR<br /><br />There is more to it than that- cause this guy fixed up my third laptop really good.<br /><br />And, I actually know this guy socially and I am sure. So I felt OK about it.<br /><br />How come nobody, even SR, can fix the problem?- except this one guy.<br /><br />Q

				Wow, You made a mistake in my opinion, Now before you start biting my head off let me explain why. <br />As a moderator has already told you, ALL you need to access the road is a computer with TOR. Of course its safer to use tails or whonix, But if you absolutely wanted to you only need the tor browser bundle, There is nothing to &quot;tweak&quot;.<br /><br />I could see where your coming from, But you should never had asked a tech guy to sort it for SR, and not because he might sell you out to the cops but because it would have taken him 2 minutes to download a keylogger onto your computer and get your Sr details, Hell, This guy doesnt know if you spend thousands on here a month but he knows you dont know a lot about pc&#039;s and probably wouldent be able to check if he had.<br /><br />I would maybe take it to another pc repair shop and just say, I think someone installed a keylogger can you check for me. It wont take long.

				You started another thread saying you were worried that the cops were going to bug your car or house yet you took your computer to the shop and openly told them you buy drugs here? Surely this is a joke.

				Thanks the time and date theory sounds right.<br /><br />I know this guy, however I will look for a key logger. I am sure the kid is a customer here.<br /><br />
