				Hi everyone, I&#039;m a total newbie here so I hope I&#039;m not going to ask a stupid question. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been spending hours trying to find the safest and most secure way possible to get orders in the mail. I know sending to a fake name is a bad idea, as is misspelling your name, and that when you get the package you should write &quot;return to sender&quot; and leave it for a day. <br /><br />My problem is that I don&#039;t know anybody else who is interested in this and get scared when I even try to talk about it. I brought up SR to a RL friend and he looked at me as though I had sprouted three heads. This means I don&#039;t have a secure address to rely on. I could send it to my parents, who are my registered address, but they won&#039;t write &quot;return to sender&quot; and of course they&#039;ll have no idea what&#039;s inside. I would also have to use my own name (if I used one of theirs, they could open the envelope and then all hell would break loose). <br /><br />Is it so bad to get it posted directly to me? Do you have any horror stories about this? I do NOT want to get caught as not only my career, but many other things are relying on my discretion.<br /><br />Thanks in advance. :)

Have some respect for your parents, and don&#039;t order it to your home.<br /><br />There are no guarantees in this game my friend, just risks all the way. Do your best to reduce those, but know that you may be caught. It sounds like this is a risk you should not take, keep searching for somewhere else to have it delivered to.
