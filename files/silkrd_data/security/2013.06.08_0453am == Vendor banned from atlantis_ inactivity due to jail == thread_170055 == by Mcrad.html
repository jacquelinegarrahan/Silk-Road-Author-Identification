				first off your on the wrong forum second of all you admit you were busted and in jail which means your already on leos radar so why would anybody want to buy from you now knowing theres a greater chance of you getting popped potentially with your customers information or package in your possesion?

				Atlantis always smelled like LE to me, they&#039;re disclaimer said they could release information at any time. Glad I never even made an account. <br /><br />As far as inactivity due to jail on SR, Juergen2001 used to be my go to guy for MDMA and just dissapeared. Might he have gotten in legal trouble?

				&nbsp;:) I always read your posts with that voice in my head too. Kinda like Michael Scott from The Office.<br /><br />I had just a funny idea for a thread in Off Topic. I might start a thread where people write who&#039;s voice they imagine when they read a regular forum member&#039;s posts..<br /><br />For example, I ALWAYS read Jack N Hoffs posts with Bill Clinton&#039;s voice in mind (I wonder why).

				I would certainly think if you&#039;ve had recent troubles with the law, you should avoid vending illegal drugs/being around them until your completely in the clear. But you should go talk to atlantis about this situation?
