				I just deposited cash with walmart and another moneygram agent to zipzip for btc that were going straight to my SR address. Bitinstant and ZipZap both sent me confirmation emails, and on the Bitinstant transaction record on their website it shows &quot;order executed, funds deposited at remote exchange&quot; on both deposits. Whoever, when I tried copying and pasting the address to the blockhain.info search feature to track my confirmations. It just keeps saying &quot;Unrecognized search pattern&quot; and the transaction is not showing up on the blockchain. What gives?

				I bought some BTCs this week and send it to sr, as I did it already 3 or 4 times before. Different from the previous transactions, the last one took over 5 hours even to show up in the blockchain and another 4 to get to my sr account. So don´t worry too much :)

				Update- I emailed bitinstant and told them of the issue. Rachel replied faster than I have ever seen their customer support do. Anyway, she said the tech people were on it to push it through and soon after I had my btc in my SR account, still without the blockchain.info tracking working interestingly, (it now does work) and minus about twice the amount that Bitinstant was supposed to take in fees originally. Fuck them, they really do just suck in my opinion.&nbsp;

				it was not bitinstants fault dude.. lol <br /><br />it happened to me to but im such a seasoned slaver that it didnt even bother me i knew it would get worked out<br /><br />it was every single bitcoins address i would put into blockchain would say unrecognized search pattern..<br /><br />2maro bitinstant will prolly try to push it through again and it will work since now all the addresses are working fine.. <br /><br />its just a lil glitch in the system no big deal.. your coins are safe.. <br /><br />and btw thats an automated message you got lol i got it two i have several times always says the same shit<br /><br />
