				Its been about 4 months since the last time I logged into this wonderful world. Yesterday, I decided to log back on and to my surprise SR is still up and running. Just have a few questions that need to be answer before I get back into the swing of things. <br /><br /><br />1. is the login site still under this (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion) <br />2. Went to log on and look like they made of upgraded the site. I just wanna make sure Im not on a phishing site. Loginpage looks different as does the homepage of silkroad.&nbsp; My few coins were still in so I just figured they updated the site since i been gone<br />3. What has happened to the BTC Market. I checked last night and one coin is going around 11-12 bucks. Did sumthing happened while i was gone? Have the prices for goods gone up dramatically? <br />4. Is bitinstant to mt.gox to instawallet to SR still good to use? Whats the most current method of obtaining coins<br />5. Lastly if anyone has anything to add , since I been away from SR for awhile I would appericate it!<br /><br /><br /><br />Life is good, Keep on smiling everyone

				1. Yes it&#039;s the same. (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion)<br />2. They upgraded the site. (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31863.0)<br />3. Are you saying $11 per BTC is high or low? Anyway, BTC has been growing at a pretty good rate over the last two months. Very healthy market. (http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg180ztgTzm1g10zm2g25zv).<br />4. That&#039;s a roundabout way to do it. You could go stright from Bitinstant to SR. If you&#039;re worried about privacy, blockchain.info has a anonymizing service that takes 1.5%. SR also has a coin tumbler that is used by default.<br />5. Stay in escrow. DO NOT finalize early. (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/about) Even if the vendor asks you to. Choose a different vendor. Finalizing Early is a surefire way to get scammed and there have been several cases where vendors have run off with hundreds if not thousands of coins.<br /><br />Just do research. This isn&#039;t like amazon where you just click and buy. Read read read.
