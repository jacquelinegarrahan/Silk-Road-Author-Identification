I have created a tormail.org account. For some reason, I am unable to get mail application from the mac system to link to the tormail server. what am i doing wrong? can someone please help me? thanks in advance...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re not doing anything wrong.&nbsp; Apple&#039;s Mail software is simply incompatible with Tor-based email services like TorMail.&nbsp; There simply appears to be no way to get Mail to use the .onion IMAP/SMTP/POP3 servers. <br /><br />If you want to use an email client with TorMail, you have no choice but to use Thunderbird. <br /><br />I&#039;ve run into this before. This is how I solved it...<br /><br />First off, I&#039;d like to confirm that it is possible to use Thunderbird to access your TorMail accounts. <br /><br />The main problem is that while the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) is fine for web surfing, it is simply not adequate for other applications, like Thunderbird.<br /><br />To solve that problem, you need to install the Vidalia Bundle, which you can find at: https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia-bundles/vidalia-bundle-0.2.2.38-0.2.20-i386.dmg<br /><br />Now, you can still use the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) to surf the web -- the Browser Bundle and the Vidalia Bundle appear to co-exist quite nicely, without stepping on each other&#039;s toes.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, in other words, you&#039;re running TWO copies of Vidalia -- one with the Tor Browser Bundle (for surfing the web), with the other being the stand-alone Vidalia Bundle, that services Thunderbird and other applications.&nbsp; N.B.: The Vidalia bundle has to be up and running before you can access Tormail through Thunderbird. <br /><br />Before you install the Vidalia Browser Bundle, and make changes to your email configuration, you must ensure that Enigmail is installed first. Enigmail can be found in the Add-Ons. Enigmail works with OpenPGP software like GPG, and can be configured to automatically encrypt and decrypt email.<br /><br />Essentially, Enigmail is a front-end to GPG, and adds functionality such that messages can automatically be encrypted, if the recipient&#039;s keys are in your PGP keyring. Messages can also be automatically decrypted as well, once the passphrase has been entered.<br /><br />Once Enigmail and the Vidalia Browser Bundle are installed, you need to:<br /><br />1) Change your proxy settings in Thunderbird.<br /><br />To do that, while in Thunderbird, use control-comma to bring up the preferences widow.<br /><br />Click on the General Tab<br />Click on the Config Editor button.<br /><br />You&#039;ll get a warning dialog box, just click &quot;I&#039;ll be careful, I promise.&quot;&nbsp; to proceed. <br /><br />You will then&nbsp; be at a page with many values. There will be a long search&nbsp; form at the top where you can enter some text.<br /><br />Enter the following: network.proxy.socks -- the one you want is: network.proxy.socks_remote_dns - click on the value to toggle it from false to true. Click on the red x in the upper left hand corner to close this window. You will now be back at the Configuration window.<br /><br />Click on the&nbsp; Network and Disk Space Tab., then click on the Settings button.<br /><br />The next window will be Configure Proxies to Access the Internet<br /><br />Ensure the Manual proxy configuration button is checked.<br /><br />Under http proxy, enter a value of 127.0.0.1 and a port of 8118<br /><br />Under SSL proxy, enter a value of 127.0.0.1 and a port of 8118<br /><br />Under Socks Host, enter a value of 127.0.0.1 and a port of 9050<br /><br />Make sure the Socks v4 radio button is checked.<br /><br />Once you have done that, click on OK.<br /><br />Now close out the Advanced window by clicking on the red x in the left hand corner.<br /><br />N.B.:&nbsp; You may need to re-start the Vidalia Browser bundle each time you re-start your machine.<br /><br />2) Adding your TorMail account to Thunderbird<br /><br />From the main Thunderbird window, choose Tools --&gt; Account settings.&nbsp; From the leftmost pane, click on the drop-down button Account Actions and choose Add Email Account.<br /><br />From the next popup window, add your name, email address, and password; then click the continue button.<br /><br />Next, click the Manual Config button at the bottom of the next window.<br /><br />Enter the following value into the respective fields:<br /><br />Incoming: IMAP&nbsp; Server hostname will read tormail.org -- replace this with jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion. Leave the port at 143 Change SSL to none and Authentication to normal password<br /><br />Outgoing SMTP&nbsp; Server hostname will read tormail.org -- replace this with jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion. Leave the port at 25. Change SSL to None and Authentication to normal password.<br /><br />Then click the Create Account button.<br /><br />At this point, a large red warning box will come up warning you that encryption is not used. Remember, the Tor network encrypts all data packets flowing through it. As TorMail is a hidden service, the data never leaves the Tor network, so the settings are safe.&nbsp; Put a checkmark in the box &quot;I accept the risks&quot;&nbsp; and click the Create Account button.<br /><br />Thunderbird will attempt to login to your account; you will see it say,&nbsp; &quot;Checking password&quot;.<br /><br />That screen will disappear, and you will be back at the accounts page. You can then click on OK to close it out, and your TorMail account will be operational under Thunderbird.<br /><br />3) Instructing OpenPGP/Enigmail as to how to treat incoming/outgoing messages<br /><br />We&#039;re still at the Accounts page. Select an account from the left-hand pane by clicking on it. Click on OpenPGP from the top-most menu.<br /><br />Under this menu you will see a number of options (some of which may be greyed-out)<br /><br />- Decrypt/Verify<br /><br />- Save Decrypted Message<br /><br />- Automatically Decrypt/Verify Messages<br /><br />- Clear Saved Passphrase<br /><br />- Reload Message<br /><br />- Sender&#039;s Key sub-options:<br /><br />&nbsp; - Import public key<br />&nbsp; - View Key Properties<br />&nbsp; - Sign Key<br />&nbsp; - Set Owner Trust<br />&nbsp;<br />- Preferences<br /><br />- Edit Per-Recipient Rules<br /><br />- Key Management<br /><br />- Manage Smartcard<br /><br />- Debugging Options sub-options:<br /><br />&nbsp; - View Console<br />&nbsp; - View Logfile<br />&nbsp;<br />- Help<br /><br />- Setup Wizard<br /><br />- About OpenPGP<br /><br />The one we&#039;re interested in is Setup Wizard.<br /><br />Click on Setup Wizard, and you&#039;ll be asked if you&#039;d like to use the Wizard now?<br /><br />click the radio button that says, Yes, I would like the wizard to get me started<br /><br />Click Continue<br /><br />Now you will be at the Select Identities pane.<br /><br />You will be asked, Would you like to setup Open PGP for all identities?<br /><br />click the radio button Yes.<br /><br />Click Continue.<br /><br />The wizard will now ask if you want to sign all your outgoing email.<br /><br />You can choose Yes or No as you desire. The upside to signing email is that this guarantees the recipient that the email is genuine, and not forged; the downside is that you lose all deniability.<br /><br />Click Continue<br /><br />You will next be asked if all your outgoing email should be encrypted by default?<br /><br />You can choose Yes or No. Choosing Yes is a safe option.<br /><br />click Continue<br /><br />The wizard will next ask you for permission to change some settings to make sure there are no problems with signing and/or encryption.<br /><br />Click the Yes radio button.<br /><br />Next the wizard will detect any keys that you may have on your PGP keyring. It will show you a list of these keys. There will also be a radio button which will allow you to generate a new PGP key.<br /><br />Click one of the keys shown to choose as a default key to use for signing and encryption. Click continue.<br /><br />You will then be at the Summary page. It will say:<br /><br />You are almost complete! If you click on the &quot;Next&quot; button, the wizard will perform the following actions:<br /><br />- Use the existing OpenPGP key ID DEADBEEF for signing<br /><br />- Activate OpenPGP for all identities<br /><br />- Sign all emails by default<br /><br />- Encrypt all emails by default<br /><br />- Adjust al recommended application settings<br /><br />Click Continue to accept.<br /><br />Now click Done, and the Wizard will close.<br /><br />This completes the tutorial. If there are any questions, please don&#039;t hesitate to ask.<br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ily guru. <br /><br />i use a gpg keychain, mac, and terminal. &lt;3

If you did, you would have seen a little pop-up window, showing a vidalia onion icon&nbsp; on the left, and an icon of a folder with an A on it, (representing the Applications folder) on the right. You would have also seen an instruction to drag the vidalia onion icon over to the Applications folder icon. If you did this, the application would have been installed into the Applications folder. <br /><br />At this point Tor is not running. To establish a Tor circuit, you must explicitly invoke Vidalia in the Applications folder by double-clicking on it. When you do so, you will see an onion icon appear in your dock. At first, the onion will be yellow, signifying that it is in the process of establishing a Tor circuit. When the Tor circuit is complete, and ready to use, the onion will switch to a green colour. <br /><br />It is only after this that you double-click on the Thunderbird icon in the Applications folder.

If you did, you would have seen a little pop-up window, showing a vidalia onion icon&nbsp; on the left, and an icon of a folder with an A on it, (representing the Applications folder) on the right. You would have also seen an instruction to drag the vidalia onion icon over to the Applications folder icon. If you did this, the application would have been installed into the Applications folder. <br /><br />At this point Tor is not running. To establish a Tor circuit, you must explicitly invoke Vidalia in the Applications folder by double-clicking on it. When you do so, you will see an onion icon appear in your dock. At first, the onion will be yellow, signifying that it is in the process of establishing a Tor circuit. When the Tor circuit is complete, and ready to use, the onion will switch to a green colour. <br /><br />It is only after this that you double-click on the Thunderbird icon in the Applications folder. If you have set up Thunderbird as per the previous instructions, Thunderbird should be able to login to your TorMail accounts, and you should be able to download any email you have there. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />the vidalia onion icon is coming up on my tool bar but it is greyed out and has a big red x thru it. when i run my tor, however, i do have a vidalia onion icon and a earth globe icon in green that pop up. is this sufficient or is the vidalia bundle i am trying to download and run to run at the same time - meaning i would have 2 vidalia onions on my tool bar? thanks guru. really want to get this thing working for safety.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ah, now we&#039;re getting somewhere. Yes, you do need the two of them. The vidalia instance in the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) only works with the browser; it doesn&#039;t seem to recognize any external applications, like Thunderbird. That is why you need to have a second copy of Vidalia installed and running. <br /><br />Try using Control-Click on the Vidalia icon with the red X through it. A menu should come up, and the top-most item should read &quot;Start Tor&quot;. Click on that, and the icon should change to yellow in a few seconds, and then change to green. When it changes to green, then you should be good to go. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Guru, I am getting so close I can smell it! But still not working&nbsp; :-[. When I select &quot;Start Tor&quot; from the greyed out vidalia icon with the x thru it, I am prompted for a password. Do I have something configured wrong, because I have not set up a password. Thanks again for your help....&nbsp; ;D

				guru,<br />what i am doing now is starting the vidalia bundle first. this brings up the vidalia logo with the red x and also kickstarts my tbb which brings up another vidalia and the globe icon (both green and active). i am able to conduct all my usual activity on SR. when i click on start tor from the inactive vidalia icon, a screen for the active icon pops up and says, &#039;connected to the tor network!&#039;. underneath that pop-up window remains the the vidalia control panel for the inactive vid bundle which continues to say tor not running. i still have all of the options available on the inactive vidalia control panel, perhaps you can walk me thru the correct settings? <br />- start tor<br />- setup relaying<br />- view the network<br />- use a new identity<br />- bandwidth graph<br />- help<br />- about<br />- message log<br />- settings<br />- exit<br />- show this window on startup<br />- hide<br /><br />please help, you have gotten me so close i could cry!<br /><br />also, please tell me ur SR name so i can send you coin. i assume it is &#039;Guru&#039; but want to make sure.<br /><br />Thanks!!!

				damn guru, this is driving me crazy, i can not believe this can be so hard! thank you so much for your patience and assistance, but i am still lost!<br /><br />this is how i had it set up:<br />i would first launch the vidalia browser bundle. under setting on the general tab, i had the start the tor software when vidalia starts box checked with the path selected by hitting the browse button and selecting the tor browser bundle. this would automatically launch the other vidalia icon and the globe icon (both in green and working). the vbb vidalia icon, however, would stay greyed out with the red x and would not connect.<br /><br />now you are suggesting to get rid of the tbb. in order to do this, since the tbb is set to automatically start when i start the vbb, what do i change the general tab under settings to? do i leave the start the tor software when vidalia starts box checked and if so, what path do i select via the browse button?<br /><br />does it make sense for me to just download lion and run that as an os instead of snow leopard? <br /><br />please help me! thanks!

				WOW! Why OUT a guy for misunderstanding?&nbsp; I wonder if he thought his private message to you would be shared on the forum here? - Not cool dude. I have no fucking idea how I got SR to work.
