				As you did not state the country you are in I will &quot;assume&quot; the U.S..&nbsp; <br /><br />Additionally I will assume you do not want to simply buy one from a retailer that might have video security that could be used to identify you.<br /><br />I personally find it easy to score random prepaid phones from Craigslist.&nbsp; I usually post in the wanted section with a song and dance about being without transportation and needing a phone to keep in touch with my sick mother.&nbsp; I have had people drive&nbsp; over 25 miles to sell me an old tracphone for 25$.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />

				Might be useful for people to sell them here, living in the UK it is really easy to get hold of unregistered anonymous cell phones but I&#039;ve just realised it&#039;s not so easy in other countries due to registration laws.

				in america net 10 phones can be purchased annon. just about anywhere from gas stations to dollar stores and of course places like walmart and best buy etc. the basic model is 30 bucks and comes with 300 minutes free upon activation the important part is to activate from a phone number not tied to u ( pay phone or buddys gfs phone or another prepaid or wtf ever) they will ask some basic questions that you can give total bullshit answers to and they will never know. one question they ask is for another number to reach you at for sum reason, i just give 000-000-0000 and no probloms. these phones are nice because u use it for 300 minutes or one or two calls break the mother fucker, get another with a brand new number.

				If someone is living in the UK or US, he can easilyget a phone anonymously, there&#039;s no need to buy one from SR.<br />But if you live in some other country, the UK phone you bought from SR will be pretty useless because the money on it will be quickly depleted, especially because roaming costs a lot, after that you can&#039;t top up the SIM card anonymously from an other country without a proper bank account.<br /><br />A phone can be bought anonymously where I live, but the SIM card needs to be registered. <br />Second hand phone shops sell/buy cheap phones here, they also have SIM cards that were left in the phone by the former owner, it might worth to ask around for it, this is one way to get SIM cards in my country.<br /><br />The other way is to give a false name and address when registering&nbsp; (by phone) a pay as you go SIM card sold at supermarkets. The card won&#039;t be verified, but it&#039;s gonna be activated so it can be used anyway.<br /><br />3rd way is to take a bum to the shop with you, and buy the phone under his name.<br /><br />There are verified SIM cards sold on local auction websites and classified ads, might wort a look.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a good idea to buy a phone / sim card / private bridge / VPN / computer / secure USB&nbsp; ...<br />or anything else from Silk Road that links your real identity with SR.
