				Is there anyway for the goverment to use facial recognition on the copy of the picture on your fake drivers license?<br /><br />If for some reason they wanted you and get the copy of your drivers license could they search the states database and link that picture to your real license picture?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about their advanced technology so was asking here.

				Obviously it is possible.&nbsp; LE in the US can run people through facial recognition software and match you to a mugshot or DMV records.<br /><br />Two better questions are have they ever done this and will they ever do this?

				Whenever I get fake ID first I photoshop my picture so the distances between my eyes, nose and mouth are skewed slightly. You can change the way you look in a small ID photo pretty substantially before someone glancing at it can tell it has been modified. Nobody looking at your ID is going to notice that your eyes are actually a few milimeters closer together IRL than they are in the picture, or that your mouth is not quite so high, etc. To the best of my knowledge facial recognition is pretty sensitive to even minor changes, so photoshopping your picture in such a way should stand a good chance of preventing this sort of attack.

				It wouldn&#039;t hurt to change your ears a little bit as well. Pretty much make minor changes to the position of all of your facial features and you should be pretty well protected from facial recognition, since it primarily looks at the distance between all of your facial features.

				Honestly, you have very little to worry about right now. Facial recognition is buggy, and I just read an article about how it&#039;s only 90% effective when using it on a scanned biometric passport photo.<br /><br />Now, if you want to ensure your safety, there a few ways to prevent:<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />Privacy Glasses: http://investmentwatchblog.com/latest-glass-face-recognition-prevention-with-privacy-glasses-from-japan/<br />Facial Camouflage: http://venturebeat.com/2010/07/02/facial-recognition-camouflage/<br /><br />And here&#039;s an excellent video from Anonymous on how to fool these systems:<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://rt.com/usa/video-surveillance-face-trapwire-237/

It is trivial to photoshop a passport photograph, it is so small that most changes you make when it is blown up X 50 are not even noticed at all when it is at its normal size. Just cut out your features, drag and drop them a bit, then fill in any blank area with copied chunks of skin tone from the area around it and blur it together. By the time you zoom out it isn&#039;t even detectable.

				My sources have told me that the government is not currently using facial recognition today much due to the imperfections, but with programs like PRISM and all the CCTV cameras and things, I don&#039;t have difficulty imaginging them storing the data for when the technology has advanced.<br /><br />I will do tests on this myself and report back.
