				i am a regular browser of pillreports (ecstasy testing database) and recently i have been seeing tons of reports in the us section on european pills and saying that their &quot;special ordered on the internet&quot; etc, and in almost every one of these reports some idiot posts a comment about where the pills came from..&nbsp; if this continues than the demand is going to be way too great. people need to keep their mouths shut on public websites!

				There is no reason not to spread the love. Why would you not want other people to experience ecstasy? <br /><br />People know about this already. All we can hope is the Tor, getting bitcoins and PGP stuff weeds out the stupid people from buying.

				I can see your concern, but well, seller competition is really the only thing that can keep prices down. The prices are capped at street value, and a lot of seller are already at that point i.e. $20 USD per pill. LSD is over street value. I mean if you make LSD you make like a Billion hits at a time. There is no reason to charge so much. Maybe we could get some new sellers who are reading the reports. Also, it is quite a steep learning curve to setup TOR and everything.<br /><br />Maybe one could be concerned about drawing to much attention to SR, but it already has a lot. I am quite confident that no government will be able to shut down the Silkroad hidden service.

				Yeah I side with drganja. Too much advertizing will get this place fucked up the ass. Word of mouth is ok because you can choose who hears it but posting on a public clearnet website is asking for trouble.<br /><br />People who think SR is invincible will be the downfall of SR. I&#039;ve seen it with so many other sites it&#039;s crazy. <br /><br />It tends to go: implementation, acceptance, word of mouth distribution, honeymoon period, public knowledge, paranoia, shut down.<br /><br />As much as I also believe the spreading of ecstasy is a good thing, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good thing if it eventually leads to closure of a distribution source.

				I have to agree. SR is about as public as it can get. Only Chriss Hanson doing an undercover expose linking SR to peds could make it any more known to the public.<br />The politshits and LE already know and will only mess with us if they need to to divert attention away from some evil they are currently doing abroad, or domestically.<br /><br />As far as knowledge and prices.......that&#039;s the market. It could go the other way.....a bunch of people sitting on a stash they don&#039;t want come to sell without exposing themselves to local people.<br />That would drive prices down. It could happen.<br /><br />I hate (try not to hate but I do) PROTECTIONISM in all of it&#039;s forms. Corporations use protectionism to control their profits. Do you really want to use similar methods to distort freedom in buying and selling?<br /><br />I would consider SR, and moreso the SR forums, a place where you might find an invite to a more private exchange. I don&#039;t have a problem with that.....it doesn&#039;t involve making anyone keep quiet unless they consent to it in advance. That&#039;s a mutual, voluntary contract. Fine by me. This place is NOT that place, obviously.<br /><br />BTW, I&#039;m still waiting for such an invite&nbsp; ;) I must not have found a sincere enough pumpkin patch just yet for the Great Dope Pumpkin to find me&nbsp; ;D

				I was on a similar site looking up feedback for a scammer, and saw repeated posts where SR was very childishly plugged in the headlines. Thats actually how I found out about SR, which is funny since I had been using a smaller onion-based trading market at the time.<br /><br />We all know the inevitable.. its just a question of when and how fast it becomes too big of a problem to face. I hope I get set up, funded and able to use SR to my hearts desire before that day comes!

				I&#039;d prefer an increase of popularity in scenes like bluelight and erowid, rather than in general public attention.<br /><br />The more SR is present in mainstream media/websites, the more it urges government forces to take action.<br /><br />But as quoted in the wikipedia entry: &quot;the genie is out of the bottle, and they are fighting a losing war already&quot; =)

				To be honest I have not noticed this in the UK section. Bearlove (the UK moderator) is all over any mention of sources and rightly so. Mentioning sources threatens the existence of PR and it&#039;s a very useful site for HR. The US section is a little crazier (like ED on bluelight...) Such a shame that the site still has a technical debt and it quite static. We have discussed potential features like the established members being able to flag and censor sensitive information like mention of sources in real time. At the moment it&#039;s only as good as the response time of mods, although they do a great job.

People need to leave their insecurities at the door when they arrive here. Sounds harsh I know, but hear me out for this. I think the entire philosophy of Silk Road, is that it is public. We are talking about something revolutionary here (on the same level as Wikileaks). Its about regular people taking some power back, taking a stand, and not hiding in the shadows about it.<br /><br />If SR was so hush hush, then neither you nor I would be here. Look at the practical aspect. Gawker, Wired, Rolling Stones Magazine and others have run open articles on Silk Road, with an audience of millions of readers. The pill reports exposure is just a drop in the pond. So if the point isn&#039;t clear, the point is that exposure happens, and its the members here expectation to accept that, and ultimately to embrace it.

People need to leave their insecurities at the door when they arrive here. Sounds harsh I know, but hear me out for this. I think the entire philosophy of Silk Road, is that it is public. We are talking about something revolutionary here (on the same level as Wikileaks). Its about regular people taking some power back, taking a stand, and not hiding in the shadows about it.<br /><br />If SR was so hush hush, then neither you nor I would be here. Look at the practical aspect. Gawker, Wired, Rolling Stones Magazine and others have run open articles on Silk Road, with an audience of millions of readers. The pill reports exposure is just a drop in the pond. So if the point isn&#039;t clear, the point is that exposure happens, and its the members here expectation to accept that, and ultimately to embrace it. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Funny you should make the comparison with wikileaks. Last time I checked they seemed pretty desperate lol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I can see how you might make the comparison, but re-read my post. You misinterpreted the point (which is clearly stated lol). The world has an abundance of secret and shadowy and private trading sites. This site is not one of those. If you came here for &#039;security&#039; and for privacy and for hush, then you came to the wrong place. By design this place facilitates public discussion. By trying to put a stop on this your showing a clear lack of scope for the situation.<br /><br />You talk about:<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5601.msg63963#msg63963">Quote from: sr2013 on December 17, 2011, 07:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I believe that there is no point in talking about it in mainstream medias</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>^ which sorry to say, is a speech with no point. Like I said -- Rolling Stones, Gawker, Wired are all &quot;mainstream medias&quot; and they have all run their stories on Silk road, your belief doesn&#039;t factor in to this lol

I do agree with you that ppl against can&#039;t prevent ppl in favor to tell about it, but still they can expose their arguments. <br />Also the fact that some main stream media already did one article doesn&#039;t mean that everyone on the planet knows about this. I for example didn&#039;t know that any of those magazines had published the story.<br /><br />Anyways there is no stopping that kind of information, it&#039;s only a matter of when. I&#039;m totally with you guys on the ideology, but i guess i&#039;m just a selfish conservative bastard who&#039;s afraid to loose his privileges :)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
