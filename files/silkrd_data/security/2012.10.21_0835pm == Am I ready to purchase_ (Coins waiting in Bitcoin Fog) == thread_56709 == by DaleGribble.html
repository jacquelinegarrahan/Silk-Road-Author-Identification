				So my BTC purchasing process goes as such:<br /><br />Store Bought UKASH -&gt; BTC -&gt; Blockchain.info -&gt; Instawallet -&gt; Easywallet -&gt; Bitcoin Fog -&gt; 7 DAYS WAIT<br /><br />I performed MOST of this process using my mobile&#039;s tethered internet when I realized it could be a good device to use... Going into airplane mode and back out appears to change the IP. Now, of course, I must transfer my coins to SR. Are there any extra measures I need to take. I have not accessed any personal websites on this computer, though my tethered phone could be a security loophole, can associated information on my mobile leak across to my TOR connection? E.g. getting Ping messages...<br /><br />Can anybody provide a good link to a buyers anonymity/safety guide? So a guide of what to do AFTER you have the money on SR and are ready to place an order. That would be great! If I&#039;ve somehow fucked up I will just have to create new accounts on everything and do it again... Thanks guys!

				Checkout the security sub forum on here, there used to be a step by step guide but I can&#039;t find it ATM. Have you read the buyers Wiki on Silk Road itself? Also look at the&nbsp; SR forum Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki<br />and look up the vendor topic of the drug of interest (if that is what you want). If you want to buy books, digital goods, you just need to look at the feedback on the SR vendor page and possibly search for the vendor on the forums. Some of the book sellers have a feedback page on the forums, they usually give that information on their profile page. I don&#039;t know about anything else because I&#039;ve only ever bought drugs and e-books, but I am sure you get the idea. <br />As newbie, you need to do as much research as you can, because many vendors will ask you to Finalize Early (FE).<br />And don&#039;t think that just by making ten separate orders for cheap e-books (0.06 BTC!) you can get round the &quot;buyer with less than 10 successful transactions will need to FE&quot; because the vendor will also look at how much you have spent.<br />The only other thing is get to grips with PGP so you can encrypt your name and address for your package to be delivered to. Some people use Privnote, but PGP is far better and it is not that difficult if you use a graphical interface, like GPG4WIN&nbsp; - Kleopatra(for Windows).&nbsp; There is a version for Mac as well.<br />One last thing, in my opinion you are taking unnecessary steps in buying your bitcoins. Since you are using Bitcoin Fog. you can just buy your bitcoins, move them into Bitcoin Fog, and from there into Silk Road, and you can do it in 6 hours although 9 or 12 is better. No need to wait 7 days! Remember that SR has its own bitcoin tumbler! <br />&nbsp;If you need any further help just ask. It is better to ask (even if you think you are being foolish) than to think you know and then get it wrong, that really is foolish! Someone will always be willing to help.<br />Make sure you do not access your bank or MT.Gox or track and trace (trackable letter/package option offered by some vendors) with TOR. Don&#039;t access PingIt with TOR either! This is how LE get some of their info, or so some people believe. Anyway it is not a good idea because these sort of sites can easily spot when they are being accessed by TOR, and it may set off an alarm of some sort.<br />I wish you good luck.
