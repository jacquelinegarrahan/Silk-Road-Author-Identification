				I am trying to use CVS to send Bitcoins to my wallet and I am doing Bitinstant, I choose CVS, where it says pay to I choose Bitcoin, i copy and paste my address out od my account to Bitcoin Address, put in amount, put in email address, fill out the&nbsp; CAPTCHA, and hit send funds and it keeps saying &quot;We are sorry but we are unable to accept this transaction at present. Please double check your transaction amount is within limits or try again later.&quot;&nbsp; EVERY SINGLE TIME, can someone help me to what I am doing wrong here, its seems so EASY for everyone else, but I can&#039;t get it to work, ANY IDEAS WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED<br />&nbsp;

				Are you doing it through Tor?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read recently that they stopped allowing Tor, but you&#039;d think they&#039;d say something.<br /><br />... have you checked to see if your name somehow got on the OFAC list?&nbsp; Maybe you&#039;re blackballed because our government is maniacally overzealous and thinks you&#039;re a terrorist.

				check it bro.. you used that address before one time. what you need to do is get a new address here on SR.. <br />then use that new 1 in the address field..<br /><br />they dont allow you to use the same address once its been figgured the deposit is sent to anonymous site

				o . go 4 it.. then if its not that you computer settings might of changed during some update.. <br /><br />the cookies arent allowing it to update.. and it give you that error.. besides make sure you info is right<br />and dont use a diffrent name after you used you IP address they got new rules..<br /><br />your best bet is to use a new address name and deposit method.. like walmart or some place around your area like a pawn shop
