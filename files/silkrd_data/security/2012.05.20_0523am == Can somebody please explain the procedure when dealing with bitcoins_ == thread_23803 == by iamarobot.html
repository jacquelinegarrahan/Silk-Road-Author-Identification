				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m new here so I appreciate your patience. I want to purchase some bitcoins (got my eye on BTCKing) but I don&#039;t understand how to work with them once I have them. Suppose I contact a provider for 20 coins, he gives me some deposit address, I go to the bank and dump some cash there, everything is good. How do I get my coins now? My provider needs an address to send them to so how do I get one?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading about &quot;ewallets&quot;, but I&#039;m hesitant to give my coins to a third party. Can&#039;t I just keep my information in text files on my secret USB? And what information is this anyway? I believe for each address I have a public and private key but I don&#039;t know how those come into play. Are these keys the PGP (GPG??) I keep reading about?<br /><br />Lastly, as far as obscurity goes, would it be advisable to distribute my coins among a bunch of addresses, then pay in chunks from each of them? It sounds like that would make it harder to trace coins, but considering how incompetent I am at this stage that might be totally wrong.<br /><br />If somebody could please clarify things for me I&#039;d be really grateful. Thanks for reading!

				I went through BTCKing the other day and it worked out marvelously. BTCKing gave me the information and deposited the cash into my local bank and probably a half hour later my btc I requested were already in my SR account. So I didn&#039;t need to give BTCKing a third party address.
