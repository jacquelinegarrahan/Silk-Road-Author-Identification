				im taking it your $ are typos and you mean BTC as otherwise my suggestion doesn&#039;t hold up - BTC are increasing in value in the exchange rate. if you change your account to view in dollars instead of bitcoins it should all tie up and be accountable.<br /><br />make sense? if you&#039;re actually losing dollars rather than BTC i&#039;d suggest you PM SR Support.

				Dude <br /><br />I choose to view my account in $ as it makes more sense to me !! so if i flip it back to viewing it in Bitcoins that would be the same ??? I don&#039;t understand this shit :(

				I don&#039;t know how the dollar views are, I always choose to view in BTC. When BTC go up or down in relation to the dollar, the amount in one&#039;s account goes down or up too. But I don&#039;t think it should vary in dollars.

Silk Road displays the current USD equivalent of this number of Bitcoins at MtGox rates. If you have for example 100 Bitcoins in your account, the USD value of your Bitcoins can vary from day to day but there will still be 100 of them!<br /><br />You can protect yourself against losses by making sure you only buy as many Bitcoins as you need at a time and placing your order as soon as you have them. <br /><br />V.
