				I am using Liberte Linux which uses a Torified browser and browsing websites, SR especially, is super slow! It is very agitating waiting 5 minutes for a site to load only to get the time out error.<br /><br />Is there any way to speed up Torified browser in Liberte Linux or even Liberte Linux itself. Liberte as an OS is running decently fast for me so that&#039;s not a huge issue, but the faster the better goes for everything ;).

				The Internet does not care how fast your computer is, and sorry, you can not speed up the Internet.<br /><br />Sometimes it is slow, sometimes it is fast. It just depends. Mornings are usually best for me. Evenings suck. I understand though that my communication is bouncing through several nodes in order to protect my privacy, and that I don&#039;t have to pay for it. Seems like a fair trade. &lt;shrug&gt;

				Tor will always be a little slow compared to a regular browser because your data traffic is bounced through a group of relays located all over the world. Also, there are many people using Tor and there is relatively little bandwidth.

				Tor can become faster, but as far as I know, only by donating bandwith to the tor network. You will not even notice it yourself and you&#039;d help out others.<br /><br />Other than that, I don&#039;t know. Sometimes it seems that changing identity makes a difference, but that could just as well be a coincidence.<br /><br />Patience is the key I suppose.

				you actually CAN speed up TOR.&nbsp; All it takes is a google search.<br /><br />There is a file in the directory where you installed Tor called torrc.<br />It can be located in: C:\Users\&lt;USER&gt;\Downloads\Tor Browser\Data\Tor At least this is where I installed my Tor.<br />In any event you can find the torrc file in \Tor Browser\Data\Tor. You can also simply do a search on your computer by typing Vidalia and going from there.<br /><br />Once you find the torrc file make a copy/backup of it first. After that, open the original torrc file with Notepad or some other text editor.<br /><br />Step 1. Replace all the code in that file with the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Code:<br /># If non-zero, try to write to disk less frequently than we would otherwise.<br />AvoidDiskWrites 1<br /># Store working data, state, keys, and caches here.<br />DataDirectory .\Data\Tor<br />GeoIPFile .\Data\Tor\geoip<br /># Where to send logging messages.&nbsp; Format is minSeverity[-maxSeverity]<br /># (stderr|stdout|syslog|file FILENAME).<br />Log notice stdout<br /># Bind to this address to listen to connections from SOCKS-speaking<br /># applications.<br />SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1<br /># Try for at most NUM seconds when building circuits. If the circuit isn&#039;t<br /># open in that time, give up on it. (Default: 1 minute.)<br />CircuitBuildTimeout 5<br /># Send a padding cell every N seconds to keep firewalls from closing our<br /># connections while Tor is not in use.<br />KeepalivePeriod 60<br /># Force Tor to consider whether to build a new circuit every NUM seconds.<br />NewCircuitPeriod 15<br /># How many entry guards should we keep at a time?<br />NumEntryGuards 8<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Step 2. Save the file, you may require administrative permissions to do so.<br />Step 3. Completely exit/restart Tor and let it connect.<br />Step 4. Hopefully everything went okay and your connection through Tor has sped up!<br /><br />For Mac and Linux directions you will have to go to the site that I copied this from: (clearnet) http://hikiculture.net/topic3773.html<br /><br />If any of you see that there are any problems that may arise from using these settings, please feel free to post those here.

Tor devs are currently in the process of changed the default to TWO because even three is too many. Every entry guard you use is another possibility of having a compromised entry guard, and having a compromised entry guard is 50% of a timing attack. Plus you will stick out as someone using eight entry guards, which pretty much nobody does. If there were safe ways for Tor to go faster the Tor devs would implement them.

				I just re-read the first post and saw that the OP is using Liberté Linux. When I was still using that, it was also my experience that the Torified browser is slow. Now I use Ubuntu with the latest Tor Browser bundle for Linux, it is a lot faster (I get pretty acceptable speeds).<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the reason is, but switching to Ubuntu (or another OS) might solve your problem.

The idea of changing IP makes sense in certain circumstances which is why the Tor developers have it as an option.<br /><br />Example: You have 2x tormail accounts, but don&#039;t want to associate them.<br /><br />The procedure is:<br /><br />1. Logout of the first account.<br />2. Delete cookie.<br />3. Switch identity.<br />4. Wait a random amount of reasonable time.<br />5. Login to the other tormail account.<br /><br />This makes it impossible for tormail to associate your accounts if they wanted to. A form of rudimentary traffic analysis I suppose.&nbsp; I doubt everybody uses this procedure, but it&#039;s a case in which switching your identity would make sense.<br /><br />

				@kmfkewm&nbsp; ADHD, huh? Wow, forgive me, your highness, for merely inquiring for ways to optimize my time. With working 50+ hrs a week and going to school part time, it would be very stupid of me to want my browser to operate at higher speeds, wouldn&#039;t it? Why would you even waste bandwith with such a post that contributes to nothing but your ego?<br /><br />To everyone else who actually contributed something, thanks for all the input. I will look into Ubuntu as I assume it is superior to Liberte?<br /><br />I do remember the 56k speeds, but I was just a sapling in those days, and yes, Tor (even on Liberte) is much faster than those speeds. There were no porn videos back then- just pictures lmao! Sorry if I came off unappreciative- I wasn&#039;t bitching about the developers accomplishments in any way, but Tor is faster on other OSs, so I thought there may be a way to speed it up on Liberte. Guess not, I will just have to get Ubuntu, I guess.<br /><br />Thanks again for the help!<br /><br />

The moment there&#039;s a distinction between your setup and the next fellows, your anonymity suffers. <br /><br />There is one way I think you can speed up your setup without damaging your anonymity too badly, and that&#039;s by becoming something other than a Tor client. e.g. a relay. You&#039;ll have to do some research, I believe on the upside you benefit from higher speeds and have more plausible deniability, but on the downside you could lose out to congestion attacks.
