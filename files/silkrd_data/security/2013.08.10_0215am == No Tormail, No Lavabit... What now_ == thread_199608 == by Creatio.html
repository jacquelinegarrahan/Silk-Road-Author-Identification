				As we all know, Tormail and Lavabit now cease to exist.<br /><br />I can&#039;t find the the thread that had a list of alternative email providers, so i may as well post something related once again: <br /><br />What email providers do you all suggest for the Silk Road and all related activities?

				Safe-mail.net seems to be the only decent on left, If anything happens to it the only other option will be Tor chat.

				can you not just encrypt your messages while your machine is offline, and then post them anywhere on a &#039;net?<br /><br />IE could you just use this forum as a place to send encrypted data - like PM&#039;s or even in a thread... someone correct me if i am wrong but i believe that if I encrypt to userB:<br />A) who else in the world would expect to find that message somewhere on internet... IE are you expecting me to post encrypted data on a clearnet dog training forum later this week? Probably not. And it&#039;s not email, but fuck if you (userB) knew when and where to check, you&#039;d get your message.<br />B) furthermore, we&#039;ve used encryption. so who is going to break that?<br /><br />perhaps you could benefit from learning various techniques of encryption. PGP is not the only way.

What interests me is that you can use it with ToR and you don&#039;t need Javascript both to register and to use.<br />For the rest the usual security precautions are a must that anyway are true for every other mail service: encrypt your sensible info, delete messages from the server asap and in general use the mail intelligently.<br /><br />Until a better option comes out safe-mail is fine; it has the bad drawbacks of every other mail service (and TorMail was not extent from them, as we sadly found out) but at least you can use it with ToR and without JavaScript. They can also say they don&#039;t want you to use proxies but they don&#039;t block you doing it as other do and they never closed an account because I used ToR with it.<br /><br />As I said, until better alternatives (and that the majority of people can use) will come out I will personally use safe-mail.
