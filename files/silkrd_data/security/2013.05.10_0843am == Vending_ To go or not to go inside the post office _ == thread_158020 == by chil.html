				You can do it with any account with a balance on it.<br />So even if you bought the account on silkroad even and loaded from your btc.<br />google &quot;paypal shipping link&quot; and you&#039;ll get the link to buy postage and international postage, also UPS postage.

				Of course it is possible, just ask your post office people about it in your location. Businesses account for the majority of mail and they do this all the time.<br /><br />You will have to buy a quality weight scales and have a measuring tape. Don&#039;t overstamp or understamp, get it just right to the nearest stamp.

				My neighbor runs a home based business repairing items. He gets dozens of legitimate packages a week (both supplies and stuff to fix), and sends out a substantial number too. He goes in to the Post Office every day and is either dropping off parcels or picking up, or both. It&#039;s not the slightest bit strange to the the people working at the P.O. in fact, that&#039;s what the P.O. is there for, for people to send stuff. Why would the P.O. staff think it was suspicious if you act normal and not paranoid? <br /><br />IMO, someone who is trying to disguise some illegitimate packages might also be buying and selling legitimate stuff on eBay or Amazon, so the *special* parcels just blend in with the rest. It seems like good cover to me, but obviously I&#039;ve only ever sold legitimate items. In the 2 years when I was an eBay seller (and frequent buyer), I never had a single parcel examined or lost, out of over 2200 transactions. This was all with Canada Post FWIW.
