				So, I switched from Linux to Windows after buying a new computer. I have the program downloaded, but when I try opening the gpa program/file a black window opens and immediately closes.<br /><br />Can anyone help me get gpg running so I can continue my hustle? Thanks

				What program have you downloaded? Because it sounds like you are trying to use a command line version of GPG, that is why you get the black screen. If you need to run the command line version you must run it from a command prompt. You can get to this by clicking on:&nbsp; Start - Accessories - Command Prompt.<br />But perhaps you would be better off using the Windows GUI version called Kleopatra. This can be found in the program called GPG4WIN and you can download for free from:<br />www.gpg4win.org <br />Hope this helps.<br />

				Why switch from Linux to Windows for Tor use? Linux has a much better reputation regarding, and if a big security leak gets discovered in the new windows version you&#039;re going to feel very nervous.<br /><br />Why not just install Linux Ubuntu on a USB stick and use that for your dark web use. For all the other things you do on your computer you can use Windows.

				I was trying to, but it didn&#039;t work that is why I installed ubuntu on a disk drive because I couldn&#039;t get it to work properly. The program keeps saying there is a bug in the program when I try to create a new key. I don&#039;t know what it is.

				Okay I see. Probably some kind of compatibility issue. Surely it will get fixed in the future, but I&#039;d stay with Ubuntu anyway. It rocks.

				I use the &quot;lite&quot; package of GPG4Win (no kleopatra etc., just GPA) regularly on Windows 8 and have had no issues. It installed fine, added GPA to my start screen, I click it, a black command prompt window flashes up, and then the full window opens. Flawless victory. But for SR i&#039;ve got a bootable liberte linux drive...
