				Can you give more info?&nbsp; What happened that they want your ID?<br /><br />Buying BTC is not illegal.&nbsp; Do you send your BTC from Mt. Gox directly to SR?&nbsp; <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t afford to lose $400, so I&#039;d send my ID.&nbsp; I&#039;m little fish with a few SR purchases, so what are they going to do?&nbsp; Misdemeanor most likely.&nbsp; Certainly not ideal.&nbsp; As long as you are not a vendor, how can they prove you bought drugs?&nbsp; SR sells legal stuff too.&nbsp; You could always buy a fake ID on SR!!!!<br /><br />After I got my $400 back, I would not use Mt. Gox again (or at least open a new account).&nbsp;

				yeah it went right from mt.gox to sr (which is stupid, i realize, i did it when i was a newbie)<br /><br />AND <br /><br />i accidentally accessed once with tor (once, newbie of course)<br /><br />i guess will. i mean theres no proof that i have an account, used the account or even knew where i was sending it so i guess i gotta go for it<br /><br />im scared

				Logging onto mtgox once with TOR will cause this.&nbsp; That is the reason 100%.&nbsp; Your options are to provide ID/utility bill.&nbsp; You can do that, get your coins and cash out and start a new online identity.&nbsp; Or you can buy a fakeid/utility bill online and use that.

				can mtgox tell that the addresses i&#039;m sending money to were sr?<br /><br />this is my real concern, because<br /><br />if not then i feel comfortable disclosing my info and gettin&#039; the hell out of there. because i imagine they&#039;d at least glance at what kind of activity i&#039;ve had.<br /><br />but if they can......<br /><br />anybody know?

				No, there is no identifying information in a bitcoin address, so there is no way to know it&#039;s going to Silk Road.
