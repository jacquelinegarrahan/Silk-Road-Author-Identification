				Think of it like making phone calls.... for him to call&nbsp; you, he needs to dial your number.&nbsp; For you to call him, you must dial his number.<br /><br />For you to send a message to someone, their key must be used.... for someone to write to you, your key must be used.<br /><br />Have him rewrite the msg and encrypt in your key.&nbsp; Then try to decrypt it.

You will IMPORT your keypair into the encryption software (GPG4USB).<br />Your friend will also have to send you his PUBLIC key. IMPORT his PUBLIC key as well.<br /><br />Now, to send an encrypted message to your buddy you type or copy the desired message into the txt-field of the software, be sure to include your PUBLIC key as well if the friend does not have it yet.<br />When the message is ready inside the text-field you will tick the corresponding &quot;user&quot; from the right side of the software UI (you can include yourself also :))<br /><br />Now the message &quot;should be&quot; encrypted correctly and can only be decrypted by your buddy using his PRIVATE key, or if you included yourself too, by your PRIVATE key also.<br /><br />Note: the encryption sometimes messes up if you use letters like öäåéè... and so on. Therefore it is highly suggested when dealing with vendors that you do not use them.<br /><br />NEVER share you PRIVATE key with anyone. Not even your mom.

				Thanks guys! I figured it out last night. I just wiped out all the info I had already created and saved in GPG and started fresh with a new pub and private key and had someone send me a message and it ended up working fine. I don&#039;t know what the problem ended up being, but I&#039;m guessing it was on the other guy&#039;s end the first time since GPG didn&#039;t prompt me for my password when I tried to decrypt his message, it just went straight to that error.<br /><br />:D
