				I have informations that Operation Pangea V will start next week!<br /><br />If you dont know what Operation Pangea is:<br /><br />http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Pharmaceutical-crime/Operations/Operation-Pangea<br /><br />&quot;<br />Operation Pangea is an international week of action tackling the online sale of counterfeit and illicit medicines and highlighting the ﻿ dangers of buying medicines online. Coordinated by INTERPOL, the annual operation brings together customs, health regulators, national police and the private sector from countries around the world.<br /><br />Activities target the three principal components used by illegal websites to conduct their trade – the Internet Service Provider (ISP), payment systems and the delivery service.<br /><br />The operation has gained significant momentum since its launch in 2008. The first phase of the operation brought together 10 countries, with the number rising to more than 80 in 2011.<br />&quot;<br /><br />TO ALL BUYERS/VENDORS:<br /><br />I highly recommend stop ordering/seding from now on and resume after Operation Pangea.

				Well, looks like it&#039;s main focus in on prescription drugs from online vendors..&nbsp; thats not to say this site is not a target.. but the profiling on packages sent by anyone other than prominent prescription drug vendors won&#039;t be as visible.&nbsp; &nbsp;i may be wrong, but most prescription drug vendors don&#039;t use our payment method.. and they are notoriously international.&nbsp; <br /><br />with that said, i&#039;m still going to take it easy next week.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they will announce a sr operation.

				exactly?&nbsp; &nbsp; sorry but i don´t work at Interpol ;-) in recent years, the action was about one week. you can read everything here: <br /><br />http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Pharmaceutical-crime/Operations/Operation-Pangea<br /><br />And how would they target active buyers and sellers on SR?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; same way like buyers of &quot;illegal medicines&quot; maybe scanners, etc. i don´t now, buy fact is they will.<br />Pills are pills u now what i mean ;-)<br /><br />I am sorry that this is so little interested. especially the admins, why they don´t&nbsp; push or pin this post?

If they really wanted to increase their busts, why announce it like that? Then again, I see that happen all the time. Checkpoints are announced in the newspaper. In fact, it&#039;s a requirement by law, so you can almost always get around them. Likewise, sometimes local police departments get grants to crack down on underage drinking or drinking and driving when college classes start or around Halloween, and that&#039;s always announced.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Because if they actually &quot;Cracked down on crime&quot;then the crime statistics would go through the roof, and the ruling government of that time would look terrible in the history books

				This was posted on the 21st, so Pangea should be active right now. I wonder how much of a priority SR is during this. If we&#039;re being targeted that is bad news and good news. This could put a lot of people in jail and might hurt the darknet, but it would also prove that we are causing some problems for LE and they are getting worried. &quot;First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win.&quot; Gandhi<br /><br />Not sure what the best approach would be to combat such an extensive operation. If its possible to conduct business unaffected then I think that would be the way to go, hopefully LE will realize the futility of these operations. However, if this actually poses a threat then I think going turtle would be the best move, just to minimize damage to the darknet marketplace. Either way, if there is more info about this I would certainly like to read it. I guess we&#039;ll soon find out if anything comes of this.
