				im in the good ol&#039; USA, i dont get many packages, especially express. just so i know what to expect when i make my first purchase, i shouldn&#039;t have to sign for it even if its express right? this should be a red flag for me, right?<br /><br />also, what if im not home and someone else at my home signs for the package, are they liable in anyway? i cant exactly explain the situation to them so if they are presented with a clipboard requiring a sig, they are gonna sign.<br /><br />just a simple question sorry if its been asked, i couldnt find a direct answer to this. id be curious on hearing anything, tips or stories on this subject. thank you SR.

				NEVER NEVER sign for anything. If the vendor indicates you will have to sign for it, then DO NOT USE THAT VENDOR. I use a PO Box. And sometimes the delivery is larger then my small PO BOX so the post office leaves a card letting me know they are holding onto something. No signature, no writing, nothing.g I just give them the card with nothing on it and they give me my delivery.<br /><br />

				From the USPS site regarding Express Mail:<br /><br />&quot;Express Mail must be signed for (unless the sender has chosen the Waiver of Signature Option). &quot;<br /><br />So either the seller did not use the waiver option when they shipped, or....<br /><br />

				This is a hotly debated subject, and many disagree with me on this...but I say yes, you should sign for a package.&nbsp; In an anonymous situation like this, scamming is possible.&nbsp; If a vendor sends something out without a signature required, who is to say that it was ever received? <br /><br />I personally do not believe that signing for a package puts you significantly more at risk for being charged.&nbsp; <br /><br />In a court, one could make the argument that one would sign for any package, whether they were expecting it or not, and signing does not prove intent to receive the true contents of the package (since you didn&#039;t know what was in there).&nbsp; Or just have someone else with whom you are living sign for it.&nbsp; If they have enough evidence to charge you after you sign for a package, chance are they had enough evidence without requiring you to sign.&nbsp; <br /><br />Additionally, there have been controlled deliveries where a signature was NOT required, meaning that using a signature to get a heads-up of a upcoming controlled delivery isn&#039;t reliable.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve signed a couple of times.&nbsp; Not that big a deal.&nbsp; A lot of times we start passing on information on here because it just *sounds* right, without any real knowledge of the law or how it applies.&nbsp; We put too much stock in this whole &#039;controlled delivery&#039; theory.&nbsp; And that&#039;s all it appears to me, to be, is a theory.&nbsp; Truth is, we don&#039;t know, we&#039;ve not had any major busts.&nbsp; Use common sense, don&#039;t talk, and do what seems indicated.

Just something being common sense is not enough.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually with 328502E until someone can explain to me why I should never sign for something. This doesn&#039;t mean I prefer signed packages over non-signed, but I won&#039;t get scared if I have to put a signature somewhere.

				Hey, I just came home and got a notice from my local post office, there are 2 packages waiting for me which I have to sign. I&#039;m from Germany btw. Actually I have 2 open orders. I&#039;m wondering because my mate was home all morning and says he didn&#039;t hear the doorbell. So that indicates, that they want me to come to the post office. There is also no time stamp, what they use usually when nobody was home.<br /><br />What should I do now?

				Thanks for your good Karma guys :)<br />I have contacted the vendor and he told me, that you have to be at home for tracked shipping.<br />When I was going to the post office I was still very nervous, because there were 2 packages for me waiting.<br />But the vendor just made a mistake and send out 2 packages to me.<br />Yea :) So out of such a bad situation finally developed a win win situation. Now I got 10 tabs for free :)

				I just ordered legal substances from a vendor here on the road, after placing the order, I was notified that I would need to sign for it.<br /><br />EEK!&nbsp; Paranoia floods my mind!!<br /><br />But then, he has reason to require receipt of delivery and insured. it is a pricey order, I am a new custy.&nbsp; <br />My buyers stats are<br />in order amounts<br />20$<br />8$<br />10$<br />35$<br />70$<br />125$<br /><br />To be honest, I don&#039;t need lots of drugs, or sell any drugs.&nbsp; I&#039;m just a bargin hunter.&nbsp; If I can get shit for 1$ a hit in a large order and only order once every few months, or 5$ a hit for a small order, I&#039;m going as big as I can. <br /><br />TLDR; don&#039;t sign for shit!&nbsp; Build trust with a vendor so they are not wary or your intentions.
