				Absolutely NOT! Using any mobile device to access SR is playing with fire. The app, Onion Browser, has a multitude of issues with the following two below, a major concern!<br /><br />Javascript cannot be disabled, meaning exploiting a vulnerability could be as simple as sending it to the phone disguised as an update from the phone&#039;s network carrier where it&#039;s opened (executed) unknowingly by you.<br /><br />HTML5 Geolocation API cannot be disabled meaning it&#039;s a real life tracking device for those who may be interested in knowing where you are.<br /><br />I personally would avoid using these gimmick apps. Stick with the T.B.B as you know it.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />This topic has been debated extensively on the forum previously in approx. 5 different threads if you have a look around.

Not using Tor + Orbot as people would normally, but rather have a custom stripped down version of android (like cyanogen mod) but specifically tailored for TOR use. Something like a mobile version of the Linux Distro Tails. Maybe it doesn&#039;t exist yet but what would potential issues be?

				I agree completely butt if you do get desperate and you have a jailbroken ipad you can download Tor Toggle from cydia along with onion browser and it does change your IP adress on both safari and onion browser. also with tor toggle set up it acts as a a proxy to any wifi connection you connect to. I mean yeah its cool to have SR everywhere you go but its not cool when an undercover DEA agent walks pass you at starbucks.

It will be in my post history but I don&#039;t have time to find it now. It&#039;s up to the individual, but from my own research, I certainly won&#039;t be using a mobile device to access SR. There is also an interview with world renowned hacker, Jacob Applebaum, which makes for some very interesting reading. Again, there is a link I posted somewhere in my post history if you&#039;re interested. :)

				If your mobile device is measured to your real name and real address, then you are a very, very silly n00b.<br /><br />If you use hardware that has proprietary--closed source--software, then you are a very, very silly n00b.<br /><br />If you have to ask questions like this on a public forum, then you are a very, very silly n00b.<br /><br />If you do some reading and thinking, then some more reading, then ask questions before doing, get good answers, reword your question, get better answers, then you are an evolving n00b... and might stay out of jail.
