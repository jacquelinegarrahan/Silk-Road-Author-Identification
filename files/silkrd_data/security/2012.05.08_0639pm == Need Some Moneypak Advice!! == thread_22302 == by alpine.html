				So I need to cash a lot of moneypaks onto a pre paid card so I can cash out at the ATM. But my problem is that for every card that accepts moneypaks they have a limit of like 4 moneypaks a day. I would need way more then that. So does anyone know how to get multible cards for Walmart money card, turbo tax card green dot card ect... So I could get past there limits? Do I just need to pick one up and give a different name and address or would they know? Do they require any proof of ID or SSN? Just trying to get as many as I can. Any one with experence on this would be great

				Why dont you just buy more cash cards??&nbsp; If you can only put 4 mp on a card and you have 20 get 5 cash cards.&nbsp; The fees are like 5 bucks I think.

				Can&#039;t you also just make a paypal, deposit MP&#039;s there, then deposit your paypal funds into the cash cards?

				yeah, thats what i do. <br />theres nothing illegal about depositing 100 moneypaks into your paypal account. and it only takes 3 to 4 days to be processed so wait 4 days and you can withdraw all that money as cash. and theres no fees.

				Thanks for the help just looked it up and I can get 10 Walmart money cards under 1 name unlike green dot&#039;s cards so I might just go that route with different peoples names and use their SSN. I did think of PayPal but I read that they had limits to. Forget what they were though. So does anyone know if I get 10 Walmart cards then go to get a greendot cards and turobotax cards( all accept moneypaks) will they know I already have 10 Walmart cards because they are all kinda greendot cards just by different people.
