				Is it ever safe to buy bitcoins with moneypaks? I&#039;m looking for a cheaper way to buy bitcoin than bitinstant which is just as anonymous.

				You have to be very careful who you deal with. There were vendors that exchange them here before, but I don&#039;t know what there is right now. Just look around and make sure you deal with someone trusted. Break it down into smaller amounts if you need to.

				Yes, if you are dealing with a trusted member.<br /><br />I recommend finding someone who has good stats here or on Bitcointalk.org<br /><br />Make sure you don&#039;t throw away your receipt either! It is proof that the Moneypak is not stolen and you bought it with cash!

				be very careful as there are going to be scammers.<br /><br />break down big valued exchanges into multiple small moneypaks and go one at a time, within reason. build trust through transactions with them, really at any given point they can run off so it&#039;s your job to find someone you trust. make sure you paid for the moneypak with cash, in a far away town. be cautious of the CCTV in/around the place you purchased it at, as it can be identifying to you. you&#039;re not doing anything illegal, but it&#039;s totally plausible for LE to flag GreenDot cards used by exchangers here.
