				After you receive your product, how do you store it once you think the coast is clear? In case I ever have LE come knock-knock-knocking on my door, I don&#039;t want their K-9 to be able to sniff out where I store my belongings. Do you guys have any advice for keeping it well-hidden, where it couldn&#039;t be found even if some LE were to barge in with a warrant? Thanks. -- toe

				Heres what I do:<br /><br />1. AS SOON as I receive my drugs I unwrap the package and burn the wrappings in the pre-prepared fire in my fireplace.<br /><br />2. Repackage the drugs into a teat-ended, lubricated condom.<br /><br />3. Lube up my arse and slide that fucker up there, but leave the end of the condom hanging out of my ring for easy removal.<br /><br />4. ?????<br /><br />5. Profit!!!!

				Yup, safest place is up your butt.&nbsp; Dogs can&#039;t smell it over the poop and if the dog sniffs your butt and starts barking the cops will just think it&#039;s horny.

				I mean.... you can&#039;t really fool a K9, and the only &#039;sure fire&#039; ways I have heard of sound like old wife&#039;s tales. Best is to not ship it to the same location where it is going to be stored / consumed while still following all of the other shipping precautions.

				yes, you should get it delivered to your house, then as soon as possible, take it round to a friend&#039;s house, put it in a condom, and shove it up his arse.<br /><br />Then take a handful of dog biscuits and shove them up there as well, that&#039;ll trick the K9s.

I&#039;m not totally sure but I think that a search warrant with federal involvement is probably cover every structure and vehicle on the property. <br /><br /><br />Oh wait, I just had an idea - what if you kept a car on your property that was owned by a friend or your grandma or whoever that&#039;s not you and kept your shit in that car gas tank or whatever? Would that be exempt from a standard search and destroy warrant? even if they found it, might not be admissible?
