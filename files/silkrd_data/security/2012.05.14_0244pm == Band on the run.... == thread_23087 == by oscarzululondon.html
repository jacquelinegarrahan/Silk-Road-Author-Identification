				Hypothetically....<br /><br />If you were to get caught dealing drugs, and then somehow run away before the police caught up with you or get bail or sent to an open prison and then skip bail and escape out of the country... How long would you have to wait before coming back? (US/UK etc). And when you do come back, how do the police catch up with you and what could you do to avoid this?<br /><br />It seems to me that really if you change your name, passport and wait 10 years there isn&#039;t a lot the police would or could do? Would they even care? <br /><br />I heard through a friend that 80% of drug related charges in the UK are brought by snitching anyway.

				It all depends. If the case is big enough they might issue an international arrest warrant. In that case you&#039;ll have to pick the country to which you flee carefully. When you get convicted and they come to the conclusion that they can&#039;t find you/are on the run they will just wait until you run into them, or they into you. Only after 20 years or more/less, depending on the country, they might cancel the sentence because it is to old. <br />You&#039;d also have to be&nbsp; sure your not in any biometrics database. Hand/Finger prints, Iris scan, DNA, Facial recognition. <br />All in all the punishment has to be pretty severe for it to be worth all the trouble.
