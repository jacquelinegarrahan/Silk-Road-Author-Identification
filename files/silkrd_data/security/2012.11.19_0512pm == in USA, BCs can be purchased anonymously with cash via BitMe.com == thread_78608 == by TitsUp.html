				I&#039;ve now done 3 transactions with BitMe.com.&nbsp; You simply have to have a Chase Bank branch near you, and you can get coins with no private information provided whatsoever.&nbsp; The service requires no personal information to sign up.&nbsp; Then, you just go into any Chase Bank branch and provide BitMe&#039;s account number and name, as pre-provided by the service.&nbsp; I&#039;m 3 for 3 with Chase never asking a single question about who I was.&nbsp; I handed them the cash and the account information, and they handed me back a deposit receipt.&nbsp; No drama whatsoever.&nbsp; And the deposit is free...100% of your deposit will be available in your BitMe account.<br /><br />Once your funds show up in your anonymous account, which has always happened within a few hours for me although they warn up to 24 hours, you can either buy bitcoins on their exchange.<br /><br />The one downside of BitMe is that they&#039;re new, and therefore small, and therefore their exchange is much less liquid than MtGox.&nbsp; So you tend to pay about $.20 more per coin than the current MtGox going rate.<br /><br />If you can find an good enough deal on coins elsewhere to make up for the transfer fee, then using BitMe still gives you a way to get $ into the system anonymously.&nbsp; You pay 2% to make an transfer of $ via VouchX.&nbsp; Since MtGox, for example, accepts that method of transfer for no fee, you can get money into MtGox anonomously for 2%.&nbsp; But since the 2% fee has always balanced out against the better MtGox pricing, I&#039;ve never bothered.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve bought coins, you can transfer them to any other BC wallet for a very nominal (talking pennies) fee.<br /><br />Hope this helps some of you.<br />

				Sure looks good...of course, I&#039;ve lost count of how many of these have popped up in the last year...including haha tradehill...but anyway, seems as legit as anything else we deal with for btc...which isn&#039;t saying much....hell, I had such good luck with CaptainMal I&#039;m just about ok with paying the xtra bucks and *not* getting my picture on the bank window...but yeah, as has been pointed out, it&#039;s not illegal to buy btc...it&#039;s more like, I don&#039;t know, buying syringes or something....kind of lets anybody curious know you are using btc for *something* or another...but I&#039;m not paranoid, myself...I doubt anybody&#039;s to all fired interested in my activities, low level that they are....we&#039;ll see...anybody want to bet on how long this one stays up...I&#039;m figuring, oh, 2 months...???

You can use their anonymity service and send it straight to SR. It is still cheaper than Dwolla/Mt Gox. You can even send your coins to Mt.Gox if you want.
