				Hello All! I&#039;ve made it this far and am a little overwhelmed with trying to get my private and public keys, as well as acquiring Bitcoin. I am using Orbot for Android and would like to learn from fellow SR&#039;ers the correct way to encrypt and decrypt messages and how to correctly give my address to a SELLER. Thank you all for taking the time to help :-)

				Take a look at ---&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.0<br /><br />It&#039;s how I learned PGP&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />EDIT: As for acquiring BTC, it can be different depending on what country you live in. If you don&#039;t mind posting what country you&#039;re from I&#039;m sure myself or someone else could point you in the right direction to making your first bitcoin purchase! <br /><br />I live in Canada and my preferred method of buying BTC is the Canadian Virtual Exchange.

Thank you much for the PGP link!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You&#039;re welcome!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />As for bitcoin purchases in the US it seems that BitInstant is the way to go. EXCEPT recently I&#039;ve heard they&#039;ve been down, not delivering coins, and just falling off in general. DON&#039;T quote me on that because I&#039;ve never used BitInstant, I&#039;ve just read what other people say about them! There&#039;s so many mixed reviews about BI that I don&#039;t know whether to recommend to you or not at this time. Someone else will have to give you more info about whats going on with BitInstant or give you another reliable source to buy BTC in the US.<br /><br />I&#039;m just going to say this right now to you, DO NOT attempt to purchase bitcoins through credit card or paypal. Trust me, I&#039;ve tried to find a way, and there is none without the possibility of being scammed. Just a warning! <br /><br />Good luck, and welcome to the SR community.&nbsp; :)

				Thank you again for your replies guys! I am now researching as much as possible before my first purchase as all of the info seems to be on the forum in some place. Sorry for the stupid repeated questions of a newb. Just one last thing, since I am using Android , is the Instawallet app worth installing on my phone if I use it w/ tor?
