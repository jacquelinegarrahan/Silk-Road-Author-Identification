				The other day the police called. They told me to visit them or they will come to search my place.&nbsp; &nbsp; :o<br />I know from the forum, that a seller who could be the prob got busted. Prob they have found my address at the sellers place. only small amounts have been ordered and i dont think that they are that bad after me. But they will want some infos about the story, my plan is to tell them, that i know nothing, because i don&#039;t think that they can proof that i ever received something and ordered by my self. Or ? But that shit really stresses me. Somebody got some advice ?&nbsp; ???

				Clear the house, encrypt your computer, reset your router and set it to WEP or open.<br />Call a lawyer, some of them might even offer free help depending on your country, ask about your options, or pay him to go with you.<br /><br />It shouldn&#039;t be too serious if they call you first, but where I live they use it as a trick, call you in with something unrelevant like an accident or a stolen car or something, then keep you in, search your house, interrogate etc, this way they can catch you off the guard.

				That seems like a really weird encounter. Random gives good advice. Obviously you gotta toss/relocate everything and possibly overwrite your drive a couple times with one of those programs that will copy bogus 1s and 0s and then reformat depending on how badly you think they want to hook you. <br /><br />Good luck man.

				If they had enough evidence to incriminate you, then you would have been arrested. The police do not call their suspects when they have hard evidence and give them time to flush contraband/wipe hard drives etc. Because on levels of dumb, that would be a 10.<br /><br />Ring them back and ask if you are under arrest. If not, then decline their offer of a meeting. Simple. You are not obliged to appear on demand because the police wish it to be so. They can only force you to do things if you have a warrant out for your arrest.<br /><br />If you do wind up in the interview room, then you simply refuse to acknowledge anything about the silk road, imprint et al. Advise watching &quot;Don&#039;t Talk to the Police&quot; on youtube to understand precisely how that works.

				Alright, keep your fucking mouth shut.&nbsp; Don&#039;t tell them a single thing.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t required to go to the meeting unless they have some document entitling you to do so, or you are under arrest.&nbsp; If they had a case to arrest you, you wouldn&#039;t be here right now.&nbsp; Clean your place, wipe your pc, do everything you can to remove any link of you to the crime.&nbsp; Get a lawyer, and be sure to be ready to use him.&nbsp; Number 1 rule though is what I posted first, if the words coming out of your mouth aren&#039;t let me talk to my lawyer then you are fucking up.&nbsp; The police can and will use anything you say against you, even things you might not think are important can be VERY harmful so don&#039;t say a single word.

				Laws might be very different where he lives so it&#039;s better to ask a local lawyer about the options. <br />Taking your PC to a friend might be a good idea, but I&#039;d still push the reset button on the router and set up an open access point. This way you can claim your internet connection might have been used by someone else.<br /><br />Most likely scenario is that they got your name and address from the vendors computer, that&#039;s how they got to you but this alone is not enough to fuck you up, if it would have been enough you would be already fucked up as someone else already said.<br /><br />Don&#039;t tell anything to the police, *don&#039;t even deny*, if they catch you lying it can be enough to make you a suspect under some jurisdictions.

				Simple, as others have said: don&#039;t say a word. Don&#039;t put yourself in a position where you&#039;re under interrogation, so first step is to refuse to go to meet them in the first place, ie, just don&#039;t show up - chances are, they&#039;ll just give up - as others have said, if they had anything on you in the first place, they wouldn&#039;t be phoning you in. If they don&#039;t give up and call you to ask why you didn&#039;t show up, just tell them you forgot. You&#039;re a busy innocent person, remember? If they ask again, start asking THEM questions, ask them whether you HAVE to go, and whether they&#039;ll put you under arrest if you don&#039;t (they won&#039;t).<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have the balls to do the above and end up under interrogation, the only words coming out of your mouth should be &quot;I want my lawyer&quot;. Don&#039;t tell them where you were doing last Sunday, don&#039;t tell them what your hobbies are, don&#039;t tell them anything. Don&#039;t chit chat with them. Shut the fuck up and ask for a lawyer. With cops, saying something which you think is innocent can have repercussions. And given that you&#039;re not innocent, multiply that by 100, because you&#039;ll end up lying. And under pressure, you&#039;ll mess up and they&#039;ll pick up on it. That&#039;s how they screw you. You open your mouth - you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />Fuck, I can&#039;t count on one hand the number of interrogation videos I&#039;ve seen where the cops just outsmart the &#039;suspect&#039; and make him volunteer information. And despite whatever claims they might make, incriminating yourself can never ever be of benefit to yourself. So, once again, shut the fuck up.<br /><br />OK - one last thing - shut the fuck up.

				My guess is that they know they do not have enough probable cause on you to arrest you or get a warrant, but if they call you and scare you, that you will either confess, or agree to a deal where they &quot;forgive&quot; your actions in exchange for singing against imprint.<br /><br />The previous advice is your best bet. <br /><br />1) Clean your house<br />2) Lawyer up<br />3) Shut up<br /><br />You should be fine.

As long as you&#039;re tor&#039;d up and using a service like Tormail for email, you don&#039;t need to reset anything.

If You don&#039;t have to answer, then don&#039;t answer. Remember they can have some kind of information, so denying something could jeopardize Your freedom. Cops can legally lie to You and in most countries You can legally lie to them.(just not in court) I&#039;m only saying don&#039;t even deny anything, because I&#039;ve been reading a lot of legal material lately, and even intending to do something, without following through can be punished(as severely as if you had gone through with it). Keep it mind, they might not be enough to arrest You, but they might just need some denying from You, to have probable cause. If You were arrested, never give out any information, any deal they&#039;ll offer You will get you in trouble(as someone else has mentioned before)(and also, if they drop the drug charge, they&#039;ll find ten other legal reasons why they can charge you, just think about it) If I were You, I&#039;d be better safe than sorry, and I&#039;d do every possible erasing to the PC(if possible, destroy it), if You ever told Your friends about SR then tell them it was a joke or You&#039;re just full of shit. Because if You&#039;d get arrested, they would&#039;ve to witness and they&#039;d be swearing to tell the truth, if not they&#039;d perjury themselves and perjury has some really nasty penalties itself. So, shut &amp; lawyer up, tell friends off and go on with Your life :)<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Funny how 90% of the replies can be summed up as &quot;DON&#039;T SAY ANYTHING&quot; and 90% of the rest as &quot;Clean your house, consult an attorney, and DON&#039;T SAY ANYTHING&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />Hope you get away without a problem bro, but some people seem to not have noticed you&#039;re not from the US. be sure to check your own country&#039;s laws about this stuff (yeah I doubt you should mention your country here). There are usually institutions that provide legal advice for free about drug-related stuff in almost every country, search your local internet. I also found asking related stuff in the local anonymous imageboard to be of great help often about things like this (just make sure you use TOR/tormail/cryptocat for contacting anyone about this issue).<br /><br /><br />For example, in England they can lock you up for 2 years if you &quot;forget&quot; the password of your encrypted hard-drive. In the US, I believe right now it appears that due to the 5th amendment, legal agencies can no longer do shit if you don&#039;t tell them your password (not sure of it actually, but remember reading it at multiple places).<br /><br />Law is definitely not universal.

				Get rid of anything incriminating, (Not by smoking it) obviously, and what the person near the front of the thread said: Set your router to WEP for the excuse that someone used your network to buy them, remove all history of SR and any other site, or put anything sensitive you can&#039;t destroy in a STRONG TruCrypt folder.

				As others had mentioned, since you&#039;re on tor you&#039;re probably ok with IP related stuff. You mention you don&#039;t have a router, I&#039;d suggest getting a really cheap one that has wireless and setting it up for open access. That way you CAN say (not that you should be saying ANYTHING) it must have been someone else accessing your network. Also, look into spoofing your MAC address.

				I come from a family of LEO&#039;s. I have heard the discussing SR a fair bit recently. They are terrified of it despite what the media/customs has been saying. I came into possession of a confidential internal report recently released for aussie LE, discussing possible methods of combating SR and the bottom line is, the only way they believe LE will get any kind of result is through user ignorance of the system/self incrimination. Don&#039;t say anything about anything to anyone except perhaps your lawyer if it comes to it. no matter what threats the police make if they come knocking on your door. Unless they catch you in the act of opening a container and consuming/storing/distributing narcotics you should be right. anyone can send anyone anything in the mail, they have to prove you ordered it, which from what i understand, they have little chance of succeeding thanks to the genius design of SR. Good luck mate.

				Roger Clemens got indicted not for using steroids, but for lying to congress when he was asked if he used steroids. In other words, by denying using steroids he got in trouble, and if he had not said anything he would not be in trouble at all....

				I&#039;m glad other posters came to the realization, but somewhat saddened that it took 3 pages.<br /><br />This is most likely an LEO posting trying to scare users off. Don&#039;t you guys see?
