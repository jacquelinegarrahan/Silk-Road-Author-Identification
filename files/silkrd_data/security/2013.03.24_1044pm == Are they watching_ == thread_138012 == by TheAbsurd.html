				How do you know if they&#039;re watching you? My next door neighbor said houses on our street are getting robbed, so they scope out the area before they break into a house. However, I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s the DEA or something. The other night around 2am I saw someone get off a car, run to a house and grabbed a package then ran back into the car (so my neighbors might be doing something illegal). Another time, someone suspicious was on our street and a family member asked him if they needed help. The person said they were looking for a certain street, and got really nervous, and it sounded like BS. Hopefully I&#039;m not the one being watched. However, I only have personal amounts. Except this one time I bought a legal research chemical (falls under analogue act though), and since RC&#039;s are so cheap I bought plenty of doses. Well my package was opened, and they removed the documentation that said &quot;1g of 25c-NBOMe&quot;. That&#039;s just an example, it was different chem but similar amount and dosage. I&#039;ve had a few packages arrive safely since then, and even from the same vendor (now he uses tape).<br /><br />How paranoid should I be? Every little sound I hear is freaking me out.<br /><br />I need a way to clean my Mac, hardrives, and smartphone.

				Why would the DEA just grab random packages and run? It&#039;s probably some bum around the neighborhood doing that, there has been someone around here doing similar things. One guy living around here scoping homes and garages on this block and waiting for people to leave to try and rob them. Sometimes unfortunately we end up living very close to people that we would love to be thousands of miles away from.

				wow, that&#039;s so weird because I&#039;ve been using the Road for about two years now and recently there&#039;s been a lot of burglaries in my area! But then I remember that there can&#039;t be a connection there and that I&#039;m mostly likely high when thinking of this. SR has kinda made me paranoid.
