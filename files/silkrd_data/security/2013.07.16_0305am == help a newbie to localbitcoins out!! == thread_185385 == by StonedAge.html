				hi SR, <br />&nbsp;Well I&#039;ve gave up on BI after all the updates.. I&#039;m going to try LocalBitcoins like everyone else. But i need some help!! Say I&#039;m doing a bank deposit for coins, when I go to request a trade for coins what do i put in the message box? And whats the process after that? Does the seller send me a message back with bank info to deposit cash for coins? So please just fill me in on the process &amp; my main question is what do i put in message box before i request trade. like is it any personal info etc..

				why not just trying it out, then you will find out ;) you dont have to type in anything, the message box is just for the case that you want to write a message to the coinseller. <br /><br />Just fill in the amount you want to buy and proceed, on the next window you will see the bank details of the person you are buying from, transfer the money to this bank account (dont forget the correct reason for payment, something like LT28374711918), and then mark the payment as &quot;complete&quot;. <br /><br />Now you have to wait till the coinseller receives your money onto his bank account and then he will release the coins (which already have been in escrow after you have marked the payment as complete) <br /><br />Thats all!&nbsp; :)

				But MAKE SURE the seller has escrow enabled! At least I believe he has to enable it himself, at any rate don&#039;t do an online transaction without escrow.

				You have first to make the inquiry at the seller of your choice. Then he guides you on how to pay. (bank deposit, credit card , anything) you agree, and he puts the bitcoins in escrow. At that point, until he receives your money, only you and the Local Bitcoin admins can cancel the order. <br /><br />But , as already suggested above, MAKE SURE that the seller has the bitcoins in escrow already, before you make any deposit to him.. <br /><br />In my opinion LocalBitcoins is for noobs, and is a good way to start,&nbsp; but its not anonymous at all, if you go for a bank deposit then go for a deposit to a legit exchange site. Why pay 10% comission? and not 0.50%<br /><br />I dont know where you are from so i cannot suggest any sellers.<br /><br />I hope&nbsp; i have helped<br /><br />
