				Okay so im completely new to SR and I just want to make sure Im doing everything as safely as possible. I&#039;ve already downloaded tor browser and have been using it to access SR. That part was simple enough. I&#039;m a little confused on how to properly encrypt my address when I go to place an order. Can someone please elaborate on that? Also I&#039;d like to know how to use bitcoin SAFELY. <br /><br />In short, I don&#039;t want to be caught up with the law. I need more information on bitcoin and encrypting. I&#039;m not making any super large purchases or anything, but I still want to be safe about it. It&#039;d be much appreciated to tell this newbie every safety precaution a smart SR user would take. Thank you!

				Hi Rachet, I was on the same boat a few weeks back so I&#039;ll try to help as much as I can.<br /><br />Go to gpg4win.org and download the program (make sure you click &quot;gnu&quot; after you download and start the installation, no need to check claws mail)....do this and come back after the installation is complete and i will guide you from there (ill try at least) to create a public key ok?

				To be as anonymous as is practically possible , I highly recommend<br /><br />a) Downloading Liberte Linux OS. Google it, and burn it to a CD. Restart your computer, and boot from CD (by pressing F11 or something like that). Once you shut down Liberte there will be zero trace of any TSR activity. <br /><br />b) To encrypt your address it is basically like this:<br /><br />1. Find your vendors PGP key on his page, it will look somethiong like <br /><br />----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFA0RAwBCADgB2OUJva+L96u4k/qI6B5TH7LXWV57hixVURF5anJr3bU3YW9g<br />FWRVcv6ZBhAdidfPFuri/jHHUFtIGcyd/Vm3TAbDc2wPLzfl25ovi7+a5nYky+T5<br />4uKt+SdT/yUVOswFWPRVeTVZ0MofYGTiGoY9cEBHihWUvTtvaUFrs5I0xozSY2om<br />DOTsVDFd7QF1WTgYhUn8Bzp4oEc5XAMr1q4yY/xGHnVobaEjMEMa2b1eNPWlFjzC<br />jLX0b+Y/XEjIiQLaTMlyiCi3sif12VlpqRlvn0mFEPao16arqY6v7A5sSCgNBDfbu<br />0km4rT3zcudqf1N7DK5aC8s1vI9ZV5h3YJV/ABEBAAG0KW5vc3RpY2tzbm9zZWVk<br />cyA8bm9zdGlja3Nub3NlZWRzQHRvci5vcmc+iQE4BBMBAgAiBQJQNEQMAhsDBgsJ<br />CAcD1AgYVCAIJCgsEFgIDAQI2/eAQIXgAAKC777RC7azhxQxq7hIffCADWSun+wUH1Yvm3<br />YVM3qc6liJCM6BUJmCs4nnEB1Mcs41Z3HgG5/5Fpsf5UKvQ*p9R38Gz5W/TXKBWN6<br />EYOtun00HA5n/P8yJTC7dPetXvaA1rO/3MrD5YAzq1comMD+m8vsiDqRZwGXq0ntj<br />InkoU5X2T4qX09PTslETP+ftvddaAoGyt277oghmPDKSGOyoS/woB8Cr//3MyyMJc1<br />d0+VC6sHZzBF6yROt/hFIbB7ct4FDUe5eAS6JNmxQ51h90ENX5/KsX/NtvP7JCHi<br />DnBsuIqzqBI3QuudPeDr86cgluXnaVE4mf1xD0r01VNpkiCcH9OWNV45bWDCKPDJ<br />ye06+FG6uQENBFA0RAwlBCA32CnRwblNVVmO/+tGLIdCok2HZvA3Ug6bNhlqe0hqNoH<br />dabLL8Z0wairAcEaTZt/AREz6a3xc3aO1ITlXgAuLD5PTfsftJF/iSuhwHWxg5fi<br />P9rPK6UfXl9CC8MFv3hHNurSnccGUBeDgA1HAUMkC9OmDRE9x5uZ+o/M4OUH8sXS<br />oNiYV85teAaYlT9993Gasnrrdo7NeZ81cOVH+f8qkZ1p3E<br />0ico1OIWo2b67AwCR+qQfKmzAqzTWKZWgmqtkW9FlRree8mDCNpEc7t6mRIf3pvrzFJ<br />vfUKFVwzHVNBJxisB0i4ENZOKyN9iR+0bNJRyU/MrIQL6Hxfb2oxDmRGQ4G4LXzK<br />1Dy212PRffB/9jz6Gcza9IC1WsW00qm43tiBOIhNmgjielwObEmXOq61IUVg==<br />=CWe5<br /><br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />2. Open notepad.exe<br /><br />3. Copy and paste all of the above (i.e. your vendors one not the one I just posted) into notepad. Save As, pgp.txt or something liek that to your desktop.<br /><br />4. Open your PGP client (GPA or Kleopatra IIRC), Import Key. A window will open asking for a location: point it to the pgp.txt file.<br /><br />5. Hopefully, you will see a new key that should say &quot;Vendor&quot; &quot;vendors&#039; email&quot; if they&#039;ve made their key conveniently.<br /><br />6. Open the clipboard in GPA/Kleopatra. Type out your address exactly like you want it on the envelope. Select all the text in the clipboard - click encrypt - select your vendors key. Dont bother signing it with anything/creating your own key, it is unnecessary. It will turn into a something like your vendors PGP key block like above. Copy and paste all that into the address field in the checkout. <br /><br />That is basically it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3. Load your PGP client. Import key - select location

				ok so i think i got the encrypting working, thanks anyway. But j3an, can you please explain to me when i know Liberte Linux Os is working properly? I downloaded the freeware off the internet then iso burned it onto a CD. Then booted the computer from the CD and it seems to be running exactly how it normally does.

Liberte does not use the hard drive for a start.<br />I&#039;m using it on a usb so I&#039;m not too sure about any differences with using an iso...But anyway...<br /><br />You need change the BIOS settings on your computer so that it boots from removable media.<br /><br />Do this by tapping one of the &#039;F&#039; keys at start up (depending on the system it could be F5/F8 etc)<br /><br />There will be an option similar to: &quot;BOOT FROM REMOVABLE MEDIA&quot;. Change this to the appropriately named setting.<br /><br />You will now be able to boot from cd.<br /><br /><br />Sorry if this sounds vague, but I&#039;ve not had to do this in a while.
