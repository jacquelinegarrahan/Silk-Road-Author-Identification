				Ok so I finally tried bitinstant again today.&nbsp; It worked fine but was a crazy pain in the ass.<br /><br />First I created a verified account, not my info.&nbsp; Took me 3 accounts before I got one to go through.&nbsp; This takes forever, first have to create a new email for the account.&nbsp; Then make an account at Bitinstant.&nbsp; They send an email to the new email address, you click the link and it takes you to a verification page.&nbsp; They ask 3 questions based on public records.&nbsp; For example, say I created an account Roberto Lopez.&nbsp; The questions are similiar to<br />1.&nbsp; Which of the following streets have you never lived on&nbsp; (gives 5 choices)<br />2.&nbsp; What is the closest age range to Maria Lopez (gives 5 choices)<br />3.&nbsp; What year is your mercedes S500 (gives 5 choices)<br /><br />If you dont get it right it will say verification failed.&nbsp; Then you can log out, and log in and try again.&nbsp; It will let you try 3 times before saying you have to wait a week to try again.<br /><br />So took me a few tries to get one to go through.&nbsp; And I had some of each persons info.&nbsp; So I can imagine how hard it will be if you try guessing a completely random person.<br /><br />When its verified, it will let you do 500$ US per transaction, $2000 daily limit.&nbsp; You can upload an ID to raise the limits I did not do this so I dont know what raised limits will be.<br /><br />I did one transaction, I had my coins less than hour after I paid.&nbsp; I did a few more before I hit the daily limit.&nbsp; <br />One thing I noticed that sucked is once you start putting in a transaction there is no going back.&nbsp; I had one stop before I got the zipzap payment info, but it still listed thetransaction as pending and there was no way to cancel it, and no way to get the zipzap info.&nbsp; But it still counted that transactoin towards the daily limit.<br /><br />So because of that I had to eihter wait 24 hours for more coins or make another account.&nbsp; So I made another , again it took a few tries and is such a pain in the ass to have to make a new email account and a new bitinstant account each time.&nbsp; <br /><br />But once I had the accounts verified, they worked like a charm.&nbsp; Each time the coins were in my wallet within an hour after moneygram.&nbsp; <br /><br />One question for anyone else that has done this, did you do the ID verification?&nbsp; Does it ask for front and back of the ID, or just the front?&nbsp; And what are the raised limits if you verify ID?

				Some help for the &quot;we are experiencing error with our partner site&quot; people:<br /><br />Bitinstant says this is a chrome problem, but it also happened on my latest updated firefox. But it works just fine on the updated Internet Explorer. Can&#039;t say it&#039;ll worked for everyone but it worked like a charm for me.

				I tried yesterday as well and after getting a few errors regarding the site I was able to get to the point where it requested personal information and I stopped. I&#039;m assuming the only way around this is to use fake info based upon a common name and having that data. So you&#039;d need to do a verification with something like spoke0 or been verif1ed right? It seems like it almost be worth it to find a local and do that. Has anyone become familiar with the moneypack process and is there a way to purchase btc from a vendor and have the btc in a decent amount of time?

				I used tor and it worked fine each time.<br />I created accounts , verified accounts, not guest account.&nbsp; I used other people info, and had to try a bunch before I got each one to go through successfully verified.&nbsp; &nbsp;But its worth it because I can now use those accounts whenever i want, its just a pain in the ass and takes a while to create one.&nbsp; I wouldnt be surprised if we soon see vendors selling bitinstant verified accounts.&nbsp; I did not use an ID to verify and raise the limits, I just answered the verification questions, the limits are 500 per transaction max 2000 daily.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172761.msg1241288#msg1241288">Quote from: StonedAge on June 15, 2013, 09:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I cant get the new site to work.. all the option boxes are blank.. anyone else getting this problem?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>One time the boxes were blank when trying to enter a new transaction, but I refreshed the page and it was fine.<br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172761.msg1240880#msg1240880">Quote from: omnadren on June 15, 2013, 06:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i have been waiting since thursday for my funds t be in my account. anyone else having problems? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The coins were in my walllet within an hour, maybe sooner I always wait an hour before checking, and each time they were already there.

				I also had success with bitinstant today. The process was a little lame because they didn&#039;t understand the whole no fee (well extra fee) thing. But over all I was very happy.&nbsp; It was instant. I checked if it went through as soon as I got home, which was 5 mins from CVS and I already had my bitcoins,&nbsp; The only problem i have now is waiting on SR to recognize my deposit.&nbsp; Which I&#039;m slowly starting to freak out about.
