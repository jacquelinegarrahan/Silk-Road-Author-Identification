				Hiya! Long time Tor user; new to the Bitcoin scene. Apparent we aren&#039;t welcome at bitcoin.org (WTF!?) so I came here instead. Anyway I&#039;m just about to buy my first Bitcoins and I wondered if I need to give any special consideration to which exchange I use. Naturally I have JS and plug-ins disabled, so it that likely to be a problem? Or are most markets conscious of this? And obviously that means not just the market itself, but whatever payment service they use (e.g. LR, Dwolla, etc.) as well. I&#039;ll be paying with a gift card if makes a difference.

				Unfortunately there isn&#039;t a major one that is contained in the onion.&nbsp; In saying that buying bitcoins isn&#039;t a crime, and you can use a coin tumbler to anonymize your transactions

				I think what he was asking is are there any exchanges you can access with tor that wont flag you for using it? Or are you just concerned about the site itself working with tor?

				Yeah I wasn&#039;t really looking for a .onion site, although that would be great. I was just hoping to find an exchange that #1 Doesn&#039;t actively block Tor users and #2 Can be used with a locked down browser (no JS etc).<br /><br />And yes I know Bitcoins aren&#039;t illegal, but I like to stay one step ahead.

				I would imagine mt gox and trade hill would allow that considering the fact everyone uses them, but i havent bothered with any of that mess yet. Anyone know?

				I haven&#039;t given up yet, but the main sticking point seems to be the funding stage, almost all of those services want bank information. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s because credit card companies don&#039;t trust eCurancy dealers or vice versa, but it&#039;s disappointing. I had initially assumed that would be an easy method.

				Mt. Gox allows logins from Tor exit nodes.&nbsp; I remember reading on the bitcoin forum that Magical Tux (the guy that runs it) explicitly supported Tor logins, which some of the financial types didn&#039;t like, but I&#039;m glad he does.

				MtGox blocks most Tor traffic with a &quot;too many bad requests from this IP&quot; message and is generally unreliable by this method.
