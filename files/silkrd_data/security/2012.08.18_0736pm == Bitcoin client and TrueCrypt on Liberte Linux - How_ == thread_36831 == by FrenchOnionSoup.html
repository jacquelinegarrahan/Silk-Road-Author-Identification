				I&#039;m running Liberte Linux from a bootable USB stick and like the security that it provides me. However, since I cannot install packages on it, I have no way of running TrueCrypt or the Bitcoin.org wallet program.<br /><br />I desire to install TrueCrypt on Liberte in order to make encrypted backups of my important data onto a separate USB drive(s). It would also be great to run Bitcoin on LIberte as well instead of having to boot into Windows and sync my wallet from there.<br /><br />Does anyone know how this can be accomplished?

				I had more or less the same question a while ago, and Guru answered very well, so hopefully he&#039;ll come along. In his absence, I&#039;ll see what I can do. <br /><br />Basically, it would require you to make your own custom Liberte build. If you&#039;re asking how to install things, I&#039;m going to have to assume that making your own build would be too technical. (If I&#039;m wrong then good on you, and go ahead.<br /><br />There are of course other options for Bitcoin storage, which may or may not be to your standard, but they are there. The Truecrypt thing might be harder. Is there any way you could store them on a separate USB drive, and then encrypt them in another OS? I don&#039;t know your full list of options, but basically if you want to install Truecrypt and the Bitcoin wallet, then you&#039;d need to make your own build, or have some one do it for you.

A link to a tutorial would be awesome.<br /><br />If the Linux image thing ends up being too difficult for me, is it possible to run bitcoin straight from a USB drive in Windows? I don&#039;t want to have to install anything.
