				clearnet video: http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e95_1359267780#comment_page=2<br /><br />I&#039;d like the communities thoughts on this. Pretty scary stuff to me. They mention in the video that it covers something like a 15 square mile radius.. but you know that is bullshit if they are releasing it to the public. Its probably much more than this and eventually will cover all of North America. <br /><br />I&#039;m specifically interested in how this could hurt American vendors in the future where we are supposed to have privacy laws and such. It seems to me now that there is a precedence for street cameras and cctv in the law we are completely fucked. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to also hear any ideas for countering this technology in the future. One idea from me is to have at least two cars and a change of clothes. One would always be in a place like a parking structure. You drive in switch out cars and clothes and drive out. This would be done to avoid revealing where you live after doing a whole bunch of drops at USPS drop boxes or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;

It&#039;s probably true. More &quot;americans&quot; than you think feel safer knowing these will be flying around protecting them from the &quot;terrorists&quot;. I have no doubt that this is currenly deployed in several areas as I type this. The American government tends to have a &quot;shoot first, ask questions second&quot; policy when it comes to &quot;terrorism&quot;. <br /><br />I believe this will make it more difficult to be anonymous. The UK already has the largest CCTV setup in the world and I believe America is trying to follow suit. <br /><br />Some ideas could be too have a legitmate business that did a lot of shipping. That way you have a legitimate reason for making several deliveries daily. <br /><br />That would be a low overhead, simple solution, I like it.
