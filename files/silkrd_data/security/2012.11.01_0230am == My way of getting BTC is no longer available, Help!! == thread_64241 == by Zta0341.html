				I recently found out that bitinstant no longer has the coin to email option, which really sucks for me. That was how I was getting my btc&#039;s simply go to walmart do the cash deposit bada bing bada boom. Now I&#039;m lost, I was wondering how moneypak works? Do i just go to walmart buy a moneypak and hope to god I can find a reliable person on here to cash it out for me? Do I just give them the coupon code and they deposit the BTC in my account? Or is there more to it than that? Any help at this point would be awesome as I was hoping to get some coins on my account tomorrow.<br />Thanks

I chose WU transfer. The transaction was completely flawless, very professional and responsive guy. Even took the time to explain how some BTC things work, which I didn&#039;t know. I&#039;m just waiting on my coin to show up in my account currently. But he&#039;s 100% legit, he more than upheld his end of the deal. I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to use his services if I were you......I know for a fact I will use them again. Especially with all the bitinstant BS going on right now. Will update with complete stats in regards to how long it took from sending funds to coins present in SR account.<br />Edit: Approximately one hour after notifying captainmal of funds being sent, I received my 15 BTC in my SR account. He provides blockchain link to verify he sent them, and you can watch the confirmations roll in! Highly recommended vendor for BTC.

				Hey I just ran into this problem this morning. I had this system down pat for a year solid I emailed support and they said they are no longer going to handle any bitcoin transactions but wouldn&#039;t say why<br /><br />So what I did this time was go through zip zap and mtgox. Basically you create an invoice with zip zap find a cvs/Walgreens near you and head over to the &quot;red money gram phone&quot; basically zip zap creates an invoice with an account number and you use the phone to &quot;pay a bill&quot; and give the operator the account number and then they ring it up at the register like any other item. You can still use cash and it takes about 15-20min depending on how long the phone call takes<br /><br />The other alternative is to use a vendor - I whole heartedly recommend RxKing he is amazing to deal with and is super super fast. He&#039;s on the west coast though so that may not work out if you&#039;re on the east and need it now. <br /><br />If you have other questions about zip zap just post them and I&#039;ll try and help. I was totally worried this morning and after going through the whole process I am at total ease about doing it this way

				I use zip zap to mt.gox via bitinstant.&nbsp; That has been the way I have always done it. Money is in my mt.gox account by the time I get home.&nbsp; I really wish I could buy bitcoins with my cc right through mt.gox but right now the zip zap method works great. Not to say using one of the folks above is not a good option, I am sure they are just as easy.<br /><br />-dxh

Both are great. I have heard great things about RxKing as well, but I think his minimum is $500. Perhaps things have changed. Within 1 hour of giving captmal my WU MTCN, I had my coin. Bluesky was great as well, even worked with me outside of his usual practices. However, I believe BST only does bank deposits, whereas captmal does WU and moneygram also. Either way, your money is more than secure in those guys&#039; hands.

				I just use BitInstant via Walmart and it only takes like 3 hours if you do everything right then and there. You just fill out a small form at the Walmart money center area and fill in the information on the page BitInstant has you print out. You can have the funds sent directly to MtGox, where you can buy bitcoins and send them wherever. It takes longer to get the coins off MtGox then to get the dollars into MtGox for me at least.<br /><br />and when I say 3 hours I mean from you going to bitinstant website to you having your currency of choice in your MtGox wallet. if you get to Walmart right away

				Easiest method that ive found was, CVS or walgreens. Bitinstant/Zip Zap bill pay. They dont ask for ID. Just open a Mt gox account. It goes right in. Then from there you can send your bitcoins anywhere. Remember, when you go to CVS, even if they did ask for ID, your buying bitcoins! Its not illegal! It really does not matter if they know who you are. After your bitcoins go to Mt Gox and you send them out its done. Its equivalent to you handing me cash on the street. There is no way to connect your Mt Gox account to SR. Same as doing it at walmart. I dont see the problem with giving an ID if necessary.
