				Everybody needs to take a deep breath and chill. It&#039;s understandable that people are panicking with all this bullshit going on with Mtgox and the &quot;bubble bursting&quot;, but you must realize a few things. <br />First, if you&#039;re into bitcoins as an investment, you have not &quot;LOST&quot; anything until you sell. If you sell your bitcoins right now, then you&#039;ve lost your money. (Fuck, I&#039;ll even buy them from you if you want to sell cheap). When the prices go back up, you will be smiling. I may or may not own triple digit amounts of bitcoins, and I&#039;m not sweating it. I haven&#039;t lost shit. I&#039;ve just been witness to a circus for a few days. A circus that took BTC to 266.. and now to 80 (on BTC-E). It will go even lower. Mt gox will open up, idiots will run for the hills and sell their &quot;cheap&quot; coins, people will buy those coins, a new crop of speculators will rush in and drive prices back up.. it&#039;s inevitable. So if you&#039;re worried about your investment, HOLD your coins a few days/weeks and you can go back to thinking you&#039;re rich.<br /><br />BUT, the fundamental problem here is that people are treating btc as a commodity. Did we all forget the fundamental issue that bitcoins are a currency! Currencies SHOULDNT be 266 one minute and 80 another. We cant properly use them to buy drugs, vendors can&#039;t price their goods (even while pegging to the dollar because SR has to stick to the average on the exchange), merchants have to constantly change their prices etc etc. This fucking thing NEEDS to be stable. It doesn&#039;t matter if that stable is $100 or $200 or $1,000.. it can NOT be volatile if it&#039;s to be used as a currency instead of fiat.<br /><br />There is too much media attention, public awareness, believers, people who have lost confidence in their government fiat currency, etc for Bitcoin to vanish. Bitcoin is not the &quot;housing market&quot; or &quot;dotcom craze&quot; or any of that bullshit. Bitcoin is money, and money that the world is shifting to for one reason or another. <br /><br />To people who are looking at it as an investment - HOLD your coins a few days for christ sakes. You will thank me in a couple days when their value is driven back up by more of your kind. Then you can &quot;cash out&quot;. I&#039;m shamelessly advising this because for your intents and purposes bitcoin is essentially a fucking ponzi scheme. So wait till a few more &quot;suckers&quot; buy into the ponzi, drive your value up, then you can dump for $$ and sail away. It will happen, it will happen before this month ends, I assure you. Happy?<br /><br />To those who look at bitcoin as a currency - HOLD your coins until this volatility ends and they stabilize. If 1 bitcoin was worth an 8ball of coke 2 days ago and now is only worth 1 gram, then WAIT. The price will stabilize and that 1 bitcoin will be worth an 8ball again and stay that way. Then you USE it to buy that 8ball. When more and more merchants start accepting bitcoin then you USE that 1 bitcoin to buy those True Religion jeans for your girlfriend. There will be no need to &quot;cash out&quot; to USD unless there&#039;s some good/service that simply hasnt adopted to BTC yet and then you exchange your coins for that amount of USD and purchase. That&#039;s really all there is too it. <br /><br />This is not 2011, this is not even a few months ago. This &quot;crash&quot; is a temporary natural reflex of a market getting polluted with speculators. People have not (I hope) lost confidence in bitcoin. Mtgox on the other hand, deserves no confidence whatsoever. Bitcoins are here to stay and more and more people will continue to use them. The ship of faith in government backed paper currencies has sailed my friends.<br /><br />

				I expect bitcoin to crash, and scare most investors away. Who wants to invest in a market that gets DDoSed everyday? I cant wait till its not an investment anymore and just a vessel to move my money into a trusedt sellers hands.
