				Hey guys,<br /><br />Does anyone else get really anxious moving their bitcoins around? Every time I move them to a new address I get a moment of panic where I&#039;m not sure if I put the right address in. Just now I tried to send some through a mixer to my SR account and nearly shat myself when the sending address wasn&#039;t the same as my SR deposit address, before remembering after a second that it must be the address of the mixer. Still, I&#039;m refreshing my SR account page every few seconds and nothings coming through, so I&#039;m still bricking it.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t helped by the volatility of the exchange rate, which has already made it a whole lot more expensive for me to buy anything.<br /><br />So yeah, I know I need to chill the fuck out and get used to the time it takes for transactions to get confirmed by the blockchain, just wondering if any other relative newbies (or even old-hands) had moments of &#039;fuckfuckfuck&#039; when they did transactions in BTC. Maybe this is why they say you shouldn&#039;t use something you don&#039;t completely understand - if you can&#039;t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen and all that!

				Hah totally understandable...when you&#039;ve got hundreds of dollars stashed away in a freaking string of random characters, it can&#039;t hurt to double check.&nbsp; Few days ago I accidentally used an old SR address to send it...flipped out but remembered that old addresses still link to the same account.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine :)

				Sometimes hear about governments wanting more money (OK, always hear about that part but that&#039;s for another day) and raiding &#039;dead&#039; bank accounts that have been inactive for years. Not knowing how bitcoins work I wonder if there are all these bitcoins floating around in the ether where someone has copied something else after their wallet address so sent their coins to the password of a site instead. <br /><br />Although I imagine if a transaction fails the money goes back to sender and to randomly hit on someone else&#039;s wallet by accident would seem easier than solving FLT.

				One time I lost 100 BTC (back when they were $2 a piece), the old fashion way, not in stocks or bonds or anything, lost the e-wallet URL. <br />
