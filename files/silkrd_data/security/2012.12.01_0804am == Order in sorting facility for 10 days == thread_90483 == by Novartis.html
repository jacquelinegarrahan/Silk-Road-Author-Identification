				We&#039;re consulting with other members about this, but thought we should throw it out there.<br /><br />Say an order (one order out of 80+ transactions) has be in a &quot;sorting facility&quot; for about 10 days (something that has never happened with any other order nor orders before or since the time of this order)............ what does the community think is going on here?<br /><br />extreme stealth and proper shipping methods for the item were followed and other orders arrived at the address no problem........ thoughts anyone?<br /><br />Thanks for your input.

				This happened to me once on sr.<br />This was due to a natural disaster though. Scared the hell out of me because it took about two weeks in just the sorting facility. Finally arrived.<br /><br />Hope the best for you though. Maybe it got lost&nbsp; :-\

				The only options I can think of are that your package was lost or intercepted.

				Depends, is it a huge amount, like a pound or so of weed? Then I&#039;d be concerned. If it was a small amount it&#039;s probably lost or stolen.

				Thanks for the responses.. it was pretty damn small so I guess it&#039;s lost (or stolen) although there was the holiday and a lot of bad weather.<br /><br />Hopefully it does arrive but it aint lookin good. Glad to hear at least one person got it after such a long wait in sorting though :-\

				It wasn&#039;t international so no customs but maybe an overzealous postal worker opening packages...and tearing through stealth, unless they&#039;ve implemented some new xray or scanning devices for domestic orders. If they did that, well - wtf. hah alright, thanks again *bummed*

				Oh, you guys don&#039;t happen to know what happens if I just hit &quot;cancel&quot; on the order that is stuck in the sorting facility.<br /><br />We don&#039;t want to affect the buyer&#039;s stats but also want to give them all their money back.
