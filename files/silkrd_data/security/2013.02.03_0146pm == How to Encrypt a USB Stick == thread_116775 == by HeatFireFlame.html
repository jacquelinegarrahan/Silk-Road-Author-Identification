				What have you heard about it being insecure? It is open source, uses standard encryption algorithms, and I&#039;m not aware of any critical bugs.

				to be honest nothing specific, Just mixed reviews and some problems with it. all hearsay it&#039;s just that with all the mixed reviews i was skeptical. Looks fine to me,&nbsp; But im definitely no expert. <br />Thanks for your advice, Il go with it. Doubt The NSA will be the ones trying to break the drive anyway.

				Truecrypt is a very secure piece of software. It is yet to be cracked by anybody or any organization world wide and has been praised by known hackers such as Jacob Applebaum who as a hacker, believe it to be very secure and currently not able to be hacked. There is more than one way to set up a USB with Truecrypt, from Encrypting the entire USB stick or setting it up in Portable Mode.

Your best to read the Beginners Manual at&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/&nbsp; (clearnet). :)

				Any tools that can encode files into the block device? EnCase and FTK can&#039;t see or copy these files (and are used by LE etc as forensic tools)
