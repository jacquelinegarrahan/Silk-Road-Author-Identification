				I really wanted to do linux, but i couldn&#039;t get any of them to run properly.&nbsp; I run tails fine, but nothing saved and running stuff like a bitcoin client is not possible.<br /><br />How secure do you think of this set up:<br /><br />16GB thumb drive<br />windows ultimate 7 boot/runs from thumb drive<br />Portable tor bundle, thunderbird, GPA, bitcoin all running in a truecrypt file (within a hidden truecrypt file).<br /><br />I&#039;m also probably going to encrypt the whole drive, which looks like an option within bitlocker.<br /><br />I hope it&#039;s secure, because for me it is much easier to use and a lot more stable.

				If you can get Win7 installed on a thumb drive (this will be the challenging step), then the rest is easy. Don&#039;t put any of your apps + docs in a truecrypt container though. Instead, just install truecrypt, and it has an option to encrypt the entire Operating System.<br /><br />As for Windows 7 vs Linux, don&#039;t buy too much into any debates because its all about the end-user, not the OS. If you protect your shit dutifully you&#039;ll be fine.

				windows 7 usb &quot;pirate bay edition&quot; works perfect.&nbsp; It loads fast, and runs everything I throw at it.&nbsp; The bitlocker won&#039;t work, but if I keep/run all apps/docs safe in hidden truecrypt file it shouldn&#039;t matter?&nbsp; <br /><br />Can you truecrypt the the whole OS and still have it boot from the USB?<br />I&#039;m running the 64bit version, I think I will want to upgrade to a 32GB thumb.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve had m share of long nights, struggling with linux tor apps, with data persistence, specifically privatix and liberte linux....and I&#039;d fall back on Tails, as it caused less problems...but I had some weird things too, on my installations, like not wanting to use unetbootin or pendrivelinux to smooth the way...I think I like the struggle...<br /><br />But anyway, mostly, for the forums--right here--I&#039;m not so worried about protection, this is Windows-7, so I just use the portable tor distro installed on flash drive, and I also put pgp files over there... anything to do with main site, I actually use Tails for, and get my needed info from online storage spot.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about others, seems as tho all have pretty determined view of how protective we need to be....I think with me, I just like the fun of it all, and hope I&#039;m being careful enough....but if tails on a stick, and what I need in online file, grab a little netbook and run over to coffeeshop, or just forget the netbook and use a library &#039;puter or somethig like that...get what I need that way...<br /><br />And then for forums, and all the chat and whatnot, just use my portable tor on flash...try to keep all the key files and stuff on there too...not the safest...privatix was the safest, with all encrypted...but I kind of liked liberte too, with that one little encrypted folder, with everything you needed on it...I just need to take the time to fix it up with another browser I like better...I couldn&#039;t take the liberte browser...anyway, lots of good helpful people on here, I&#039;ve really enjoyed trying different things....

Install Win 7, then install truecrypt. Truecrypt has an option for &quot;full system encryption&quot;. This will encrypt the whole OS, and install a bootloader. So you can do away with bitlocker and any other encryption things because everything is locked tight.<br /><br />PS. I never did it with USB... I just dedicated a partition of a HDD, but the theory is still the same.. It matters just to get the OS instaled first. As for Pirate Bay Edition... how do you trust it? Unless the ISO is sanctioned by MyDigitalLife fourms I wouldn&#039;t trust it.<br /><br />Untouched ISO of x64 Ult is the way to go. I wouldn&#039;t be able to trust Pirate Bay Edition I don&#039;t think.

				Im going to try this install Win 7 to USB + truecrypt and let you know how I get on. This looks like its going to solve a bunch of problems for me also as I was struggling with linux.
