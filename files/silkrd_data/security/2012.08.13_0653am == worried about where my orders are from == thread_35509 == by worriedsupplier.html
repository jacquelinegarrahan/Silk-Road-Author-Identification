				so a bunch of my orders like the last three have come from EXTREMELY close to my address and as a vendor who hasn&#039;t been vending long it has me very worried. should I worry or has that happened to other vendors. I am in a liberal state if that has anything to do with it all. I am getting paranoid enough to just delete my vendor account. which I won&#039;t reveal obviously

Sorry if that sounds blunt, but your better off stepping back while you can and propose a new plan of attack. :)

				I wouldn&#039;t go as far as to say stop vending as long as your doing a good job so far. I would be paranoid if I just started and had 3 orders in a row from within a block of where I live. I would say it&#039;s probably a huge coincidence and to stop worrying about it and focus on stealth drops that are not close to where u live and good packaging and you should be fine regardless of where your customers live.
