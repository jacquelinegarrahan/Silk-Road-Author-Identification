				I had a thread on here about this but it seems to have disappeared. Astor if your out there I see info on all three relays, you said I should only see info on 2 I believe?<br />Is there something I need to do after installing to get it to work?

				That thread disappeared too? What the fuck is going on?<br /><br />Were any of the other threads that you started deleted?<br /><br />Anyway, you will see 3 relays in the panel that says Connection and Status at the top, but when you click on one of the lines in that panel (which represents a circuit), you should see more detailed info in the panel to the right. You should only see info about 2 relays there, because there is no public info to display about bridges.<br /><br />If you see detailed info for 3 relays, you are probably not using bridges. You can also confirm by going to http://torstatus.blutmagie.de and ctrl+f searching for the name of the first relay. If it appears in that list, it&#039;s a public relay, not a bridge.<br /><br />

				That thread is here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176314.msg1267227#msg1267227<br /><br />astor, can you PM me with the names of any threads you recall that were deleted, and the OP&#039;s handle if at all possible? I don&#039;t have much time at the moment but I want to get to the bottom of this.<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks Lib.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don&#039;t remember any of the OPs. kmf might.<br /><br />As for the threads, one of them was about phone security and mentioned I2P. If that&#039;s in your trash bin and you can search it, that should be easy to find.<br /><br />One of them had NSA in the title and mentioned quantum computing, which would also be easy to search for.<br /><br />Let me see if I can get kmf to help.<br />
