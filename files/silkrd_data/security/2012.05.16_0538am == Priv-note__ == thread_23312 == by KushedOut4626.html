				The Matrix is a very trusted vendor on here, yes priv-note is safe. <br />Basically, you write a note, and then you&#039;re given a link to send it to someone.<br /><br />Once the person opens the link, the note you wrote is there, and it deletes itself once it&#039;s read.<br />No traces whatsoever.<br /><br />It&#039;s easier for newbies/old timers, as PGP encyption is a bit harder and requires some basic computer knowleadge.<br />So yes, it&#039;s all safe, I suggest you follow what he says, he&#039;s been doing this for a fair long time, you can trust him.<br /><br />Perhaps learn how to use silkroad and the basics of it, before coming here.<br />This has been talked about before.

				No, please don&#039;t use this kind of external &quot;private&quot; email service. Maybe they do what they say they will do, maybe they don&#039;t. But there&#039;s no need to rely on them or trust them. If you use PGP and SR&#039;s mail system, you aren&#039;t trusting anyone except the owner of the private key. All of this stuff was set up like this for good reasons.

				There is NO excuse not to use PGP, especially when your physical security is at stake. Privnote should never be used for information as sensitive as your name and address.<br /><br />Just think about it, do you trust the guy who owns the domain (Pablo Hoffman from Montevideo, Uruguay), to ever have your plaintext address in his database? Just because he claims to delete it when it&#039;s read? Obviously no one would trust this guy, so the only solution is to use PGP, which ensures that the only person you trust is the person on the other end of the public key, your vendor.<br /><br />We must insist on PGP and refuse to deal with vendors who do not use it.

				I must confess I do use Privnote when supplying my associate&#039;s address should be sent for my Bitcoins for cash service.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t because the protection is better than PGP&#039;s so much as that newer buyers don&#039;t always know how to use PGP and I&#039;ve no way of knowing if their machines are encrypted. As such knowing that the message will be deleted after they&#039;ve sent the cash, makes me feel a little safer about giving out the address of my man on the ground.<br /><br />I think a buyer should be suspicious of vendors who do not use PGP at all as it would show a disregard for your safety and theirs.
