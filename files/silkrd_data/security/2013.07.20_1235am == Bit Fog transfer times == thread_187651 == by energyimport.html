				Its been almost 12 hours since I transfered my coins from bit fog to SR and it still has yet to show up.....is this normal. with no delay and a spread of 8 hours.<br /><br />Im nervous because I never used bit fog before and its of course one of the largest transactions I have ever done.

				bitcoin fog automatically delays withdrawals for a few hours from the time they are requested. For larger amounts (100BTC+) it might be a day or more. But because you are transferring them to SR instead of your own BTC wallet, you also have a second delay before SR credits them to your account. Bottom line, you got two separate delays going on: bitcoin fog&#039;s withdrawal delay and SR&#039;s account update delay. And keep in mind that BTC fog will divide the withdrawal into several smaller transactions.

				No worries man.&nbsp; BitFog is awesome, and the longer spread of deposits into your account the better.&nbsp; More tumbling.

				Yea it all came through! What amount do you think will creat a red flag sending coins direct from a non tor source to SR or from SR to a non tor wallet. is like 1K USD safe 2 K 5 K etc. <br /><br />

				Well it&#039;s not so much that any particular amount can create a red flag, but that the amount can be correlated to your original (presumably non-anonymous) purchase of BTC if the deposit/withdrawal amounts are identical. For example, if you buy 15.91BTC on Monday, send them to bitfog, then withdraw the entire 15.91BTC to one wallet address on Tuesday, someone could easily deduce that the withdrawal belonged to the same person who deposited that same amount the day before. Gotta watch out for specificity.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you buy 15.91BTC and want to mix them. Here&#039;s what you do: send it all to bitfog, then withdraw at different times in smaller increments (say for example 10.00, 2.66, 1.15, and 2.10) each to a *different* wallet address (the Electrum client lets you create as many wallet addresses as you want, none of them connectable to each other, for the purpose of receiving BTC). Now you&#039;ve got a wallet full of bitcoin that is completely &quot;mixed&quot; (that is, not traceable to your original BTC purchase or any ID you may have provided). Now when you want to fund your SR account, just send some of the BTC from your mixed wallet to the SR wallet address (again, not the exact same 15.91 amount!)
