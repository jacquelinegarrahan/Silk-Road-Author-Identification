				Hey guys. Seems like a scary time for bitcoins right now. I was using exchangebitcoins.com and it was great. But they are closing. Other sites have been hacked or not in business anymore. I did some research, but don&#039;t really know who to trust. My question is: where do you go to buy bitcoins? I don&#039;t want a huge list of places, but would prefer sites that you guys trust. Thanks for the help.

				I was just about to post a topic about this... Exchangebitcoins was my only useable option. And I&#039;ve just recently seen something about mtgox being sketchy now, and all the transfer methods onto mtgox require too much personal information or rediculous fees. <br /><br />I wish exchangebitcoins would come back, even if they charged a few dollars per each load, as a fee. This way they&#039;re not totally broke, and it would still be better than most of the current options existing.

				Excellent question, and timely.&nbsp; I used exchb, and liked them best, and before that, and now again, I prefer tradehill.&nbsp; But the problem with them is getting dollars in, as their link to move dollars from dwolla or libertyreserve bitinstant was down for all last week.&nbsp; It does seem to be back up, and it&#039;s &#039;one&#039; way.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to find alternantives that aren&#039;t ripoffs myself, but for now, it looks like many will go back to mtgox or tradehill, tho neither are that appealing anymore.<br /><br />Like others, having btc stashed hasn&#039;t worked all that well, as btc have halved their value from just a week or so ago...<br /><br />hard times....we&#039; need another news scandal so we get a new wave of computer savvy junkys to hop on board ;)

				This is definitely a sad day. I&#039;ve read reviews about Mt. Gox and they are fucking terrible. TradeHill on the other hand, seems to be the best of the two, (best being used very loosely). <br /><br />At this point in time, I don&#039;t know what I will do. I used Dwolla to get my funds through, when I heard the news days ago. Sighs...BTC values fall, Exchb dies, what else will happen? <br /><br />

				get-bitcoins.com is what I use, they are adding a instant moneypak feature. I use the direct deposits from my wellsfargo account. Usually only takes a few hours.

				+1 for get-bitcoins. I was very skeptical of them at first due to lack of reviews. I was going to use Mt. Gox but to hell with their verification. I wish the service was a *bit* faster though. They usually took more than 24 hours to respond to my E-mails. All in all though it was a pretty good site to buy BTC. I absolutely love their MoneyPak option.

				I see get-bitcoin.com also says direct deposit into their Wells Fargo bank account is the quickest....same as exchangebitcoin.com ...&nbsp; anybody try that?&nbsp; &nbsp;Might be worth a shot, too late now, maybe monday...will cost a bit more also.&nbsp; As far as being &#039;reputable&#039; or not, it&#039;s getting hard to know whether you are safer with the big places or not, seems they are move common targest for hackers and such...tradehill I&#039;ve used, but between them and getting money in dwolla, this seems better...<br /><br />and yeah, no &#039;s&#039; at the end: www.get-bitcoin.com&nbsp; &nbsp;is the correct one...with &#039;s&#039; I get godaddy :)<br /><br />

				Just out of curiosity, whats up with the whole negativity towards Mt Gox for ? --- <br /><br />I&#039;ve had really smooth experiences through them.<br /><br />Though the whole Dwolla &gt; Mt Gox process is a little lengthy. <br /><br />So my solution to that is to just buy em in bulk.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m seeing get-bitcoin.com as the next bitcoinexchange, lots of similarities, address in Cali, and account in same bank...interesting...I don&#039;t really care, tho...only bummer right now is that moneypaks are down, they are doing something rite now, but they&#039;ve got a good thread going on bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34812.0&nbsp; That&#039;s a pretty good site anyway, if you want to learn about btc, or have questions...they helped me in the beginning.&nbsp; A lot of them don&#039;t much like SR tho, think we give btc a bad name ha ha...so I don&#039;t talk about that, just ask for help with btc...when we were down the last time, there wasn&#039;t &#039;forums&#039; to go to, so some of us ended up over there, asking if anybody knew what had happened to SR: I don&#039;t think they much liked it, they put them all in one thread, but it&#039;s still a handy place...
