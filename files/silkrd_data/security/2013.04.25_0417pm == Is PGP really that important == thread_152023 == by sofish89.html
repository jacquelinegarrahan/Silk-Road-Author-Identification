				Let&#039;s say law enforcement some how gains access to a vendors account (god forbid) and there&#039;s your half a key order of MDMA with address sitting there?<br /><br />If SilkRoad goes down, wouldn&#039;t you feel safer knowing your address is all garbled up in random text rather than sitting in plain view? I know I would.<br /><br />When SilkRoad goes down there&#039;s always some uncertainty. Is it an update? Is it hackers? Is it LE? Peace of mind no matter what... all my shits encrypted :-)

				Yes it is or we share the fate of &quot;The Farmers Market&quot; Say no to privnote etc... I hated PGP at first because the learning curve was steep for me but now I am glad I use it. For a while it was speculated that their payment system was to blame (no BTC) but I read on a TOR blog that the feds said it was lack of encrytion with their communication systems when ordering.

				What&#039;s wrong with Privnote then? Surely it&#039;s more secure than sending addresses on SR without any pgp?<br /><br />

				Some vendors don&#039;t trust it because it&#039;s an external website, therefore it could be exploited in a way.<br /><br />There&#039;s some vendors who only visit SilkRoad and the forums only, nothing else on their set up.

				If LE get hold of a vendors account wont they have access to either their own pgp key or the vendors and yours to decipher the communication anyway?<br /><br />

Since the vendors are accessing the hidden service over Tor, and cashing out their bitcoins using anonymous methods infiltrating the network is not relevant.

				So if a vendor gets busted and the cops take his computer(that he uses for SR) does that mean they have his private key and can decipher his messages?<br />is the private key something saved on his computer that LE can find or is it something that is memorized?

But this is why we&#039;re on an anonymity network. <br /><br />If all messages were enciphered with PGP, then LE agents would have to SWAT every single vendor&#039;s residence at the exact same time, which sounds uneconomical, but first they&#039;d have to break Tor, and even then they wouldn&#039;t intercept a few vendor&#039;s locations because some people are using a more diverse set of anonymizing techniques than pure Tor. e.g. See the security sub-forum for details.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that you can&#039;t do all this in theory, given vast resources and time, it&#039;s just that there&#039;s easier ways to cause problems for SR than this, upon which I shall not speculate.
