				I have a CVS not far from me, less than 2 miles.&nbsp; I have an account with bitinstant, however I havent been able to log in my account for 3 days now.&nbsp; I contacted support about 2 hours ago and they reset my password yada yada yada.&nbsp; Still cant login.&nbsp; I think im about done with that route.&nbsp; Next thing up is coinbase.&nbsp; However I have to wait til tomorrow to deposit any money into the bank and then have to link bank with coinbase.&nbsp; And then its a 3 day wait period with that whole process to my knowledge.&nbsp; And then theres bitstamp thats connected to bitinstant, both cancelled out at that point.&nbsp; Last 4 options starting with No to Yes, Virwox, way to high in fees.&nbsp; MtGox, I dont like that identity verification shit, then camppx which I know nothing about and then localbitcoins.&nbsp; Localbitcoins seems interesting however I cant find anyone actually local around me that has anything.&nbsp; I only want to put in like 50 USD and I cant find any actual way to do this besides coinbase pretty much.&nbsp; I am not in any rush in any way or form to get high on anything.&nbsp; I might be a little stoned right now but technically I am medicated.&nbsp; I just would like to know of another quick simple easy route in order to be able to acquire BTC no matter how much I wish to buy.<br /><br />Any help is greatly appreciated

				You&#039;re not worried about linking your bank account with coinbase but you are afraid of identity verification on mtgox?

				Thanks for the PGP public key note, I&#039;ve fixed it. It had something to do with the carriage return/linefeed near the bottom.<br /><br />What to use for BTC depends on what you&#039;re doing. For personal purchases where you&#039;re not buying like more than $4500 in BTC at a time I wouldn&#039;t sweat buying from somewhere requiring ID. I mean if you tumble the coins before going to SR it&#039;s going to be pretty hard to trace. Even if you don&#039;t no one really knows what BTC addresses are associated with SR, and SR has its own tumbler, and right now it&#039;s not illegal to buy BTC in the US (though buying large quantities might attract attention).
