				After lots of research i decided to use BitInstant through a Walmart deposit via moneygram.&nbsp; I suppose all went well enough seeing as i now have my coins in a wallet.&nbsp; However when setting up for the BitInstant page, i used my real cell phone number... On top of that I also used my real information when filling out the moneygram form at Walmart... I know at this point you are probably shaking your head/laughing, I was nervous for my first purchase so i just went with it. So basically i want to know how/if I am screwed.&nbsp; I did all of the Bitinstant process through Tor, which i realize now connects my info with a Tor connection.&nbsp; I was planning on using a mixing service but now i dont know if any further action would result in (any more) red flags.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please let me know what you think or if i get can out of this situation!<br /><br /><br />TL;DR used real info through Bitinstant/moneygram, Help!&nbsp; :o

				Like Mal said, there&#039;s nothing illegal about using bitcoin or Tor. So don&#039;t worry about that. Just make sure you keep further transactions anonymous, and you should run your BTC through a mixer like bitcoinfog before sending them to SR.

				accessing Bitinstant through Tor only identifies the tor circuit used at that time. soon you&#039;ll have a new circuit that&#039;s not identified, because tor automatically switches circuits.<br /><br />just send your coins through a mixer, or use the &quot;tainted&quot; coins to buy some legit products and then buy more coins in a secure way.

Best to use an external mixer first, such as Blockchain.info or Bitcoin Fog.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How does anyone know whether the bitcoin addresses used on SR are actually related to SR? If SR security is broken into and DPR doesn&#039;t blow the thing up fast enough if that ever happened, then I guess the bitcoin addresses could be tied to SR. Supposedly, the transactions with our real postal delivery addresses and associated names are erased after finalization. Vendors could keep our real data even though they aren&#039;t supposed to and could reveal us that way but there are many many of them and each has their own internal cyber security techniques that would be hard to individually track down.<br />I&#039;ve come to the conclusion, that buyers using PGP, and bitcoin purchase with bitinstant and fake names/addresses for those purchases are pretty damn safe. Our risk is with the RL address, name and touching of the product envelope. We could be compromised if our vendor is caught or the packaging is bad or somehow gets opened and discovered as drugs before it gets to us.<br />Be alert to whats happening to your vendors by watching forums and your vendor&#039;s page to see if something bad is happening so that you can be hyper alert at pickup time. Open and/or use the package away from the delivery site. Keep deliveries to one at a time, so that if you get caught but deny that the package is really yours, that a second one from another vendor doesn&#039;t pop up at the same address the next day. (harder to deny that you aren&#039;t a crazed drug fiend that you really are) ;)<br />

				Thanks for all the replies!&nbsp; Very sound advice and ill try not to worry as much!<br /><br />So where do i go from here?&nbsp; &nbsp;I was thinking an instant wallet then bitcoin fog. Then back to SR.<br /><br />I also had a few questions about BitCoinFog, does it charge the 1-3 percent every withdrawal, every deposit, or is it one-time per set of transactions?&nbsp; Thanks again!
