				I don&#039;t think there are any negatives to using tor through a VPN. It certainly would be best to use a VPN that you paid for in BTC.<br /><br />I looked into Obfsproxy and while I love the idea I don&#039;t think it has been properly integrated into tor yet. There are some add-on packages on the tor website to get obfsproxy running but there are also reports that they are not secure and leak information. Who knows...

				Just use a VPN provider with possibility to use a Socks5 Proxy.<br /><br />So you can use your vpn (setup in OS) and in settings of vidalia you can setup to use a proxy too.<br />And if you want to be very safe, you can use a hacked wireless network.<br /><br />Providers i prefer: ovpn.to, perfect-privacy.com<br />Perfect-Privacy has very very nice service!<br />oVPN is just a small provider with smaller prices, but also good enough.<br />Both providers have multiple servers in many countries and do not log. (Especially perfect-privacy don&#039;t log! That&#039;s proven because cops take their servers from time to time and do not find anything =&gt; &quot;We do not have to crypt our servers, because we do not log anything. If we do any datas, we will not have to crypt them&quot;)<br /><br />

				I think VPN is a great idea, this way you mask your TOR use especially if you are a vendor, as they can correlate TOR use and shipping location to narrow down their suspects. If you live in a rural area and few people use TOR, you are busted. Using a VPN eliminates this problem. <br /><br />If you use a VPN, DO NOT USE the provider&#039;s VPN software as it most probably has backdoors to spy on you. <br />Use OpenVPN and download it from the original site as it is open source and has more public scrutiny.<br />Then you just need to download the OpenVPN certificates and&nbsp; import them into OpenVPN.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Looking for safe software is a very useful help.<br /><br />But the very most important note is: Never trust you VPN provider. And read all the TOS. There are many VPN service providers that log everything! (Search for &quot;hidemyass VPN&quot; - they are famous but log everything! You should NOT use them except for watching youtube or getting google ads from other countries)<br /><br />Send your traffic:<br />VPN Country 1 (e.g. NL) =&gt; Tor proxy (e.g. RU) =&gt; TOR Servers =&gt; Website<br />By using this, your speed will slow down, but you will get safe.<br /><br />And if you trust nobody (what you should do in all things of life):<br />VPN NL provider1 =&gt; Proxy RU provider2 =&gt; TOR Servers =&gt; Website<br /><br />By using 2 providers and tor service you will be safe as long as you keep in mind that you as a person can leak who you are! Never forget that you need to watch out

				what about<br /><br />Hacked WiFi---&gt;VPN---&gt;VM---&gt;VPN---&gt;TOR<br />Home IP----&gt;VPN---&gt;VM----&gt;VPN---&gt;TOR<br /><br />And id never get a VPN unless they took BTC. <br /><br />With dual VPN&#039;s your set, the speed will be &quot;slowish&quot; but if your about safety then that&#039;s how to go about it.

				Regarding bridges, even using bridges isn&#039;t it still possible for your ISP to detect that it is part of the TOR network? Similar to how China is managing to block the majority of TOR Bridges now?<br /><br />-Sammy

				Use TOR to connect to your VPN&#039;s. I use 2+ VPN&#039;s with 0 ties to me, and are paid in anonymous currencies. And none of them know my IP address.<br /><br />Also, I strongly suggest you do research and open up VPN&#039;s in countries that the country you reside in has 0 alliances with.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

So then connect directly to SR with the VPN? Please correct me if I am wrong, buit it feels safer to connect to TOR using the VPN connection(or VPN--&gt;TOR--&gt;SR.)<br /><br />If you connect to the VPN using TOR, can you still connect to SR? Please let me know, thanks!

				I think you can&#039;t connect to an .onion page without TOR (at the end). So you have to connect VPN =&gt; TOR

				The only reason why I do not connect to a VPN with my IP address is it&#039;s identifying.&nbsp; VPN companies can claim what they want, but I prefer to keep myself safe. Proxy/Tor&gt; Proxy&gt; Proxy&gt; VPN&gt; Tor.<br /><br />Essentially you&#039;re creating a SOCKS chain. (Back before TOR, many hackers used these to do their bidding).<br />I have a proxy ran in a foreign country by a close friend (so this isn&#039;t feasible for everyone)<br /><br />I&#039;ve only tested this with a proxy, I believe tor could be used at the start point, however I have not experimented with that.<br />
