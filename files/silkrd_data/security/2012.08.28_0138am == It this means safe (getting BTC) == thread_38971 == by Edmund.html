				Hi. I am from Europe and I would like to get some BTC to SR. Unfortunatelly my first deal was with Vlad1m1r. So I found next safe way. My idea is here:<br /><br />1) Register by Mt.Gox with fake name and &quot;fake&quot; public ip adress<br />2) Get BTC to Mt.Gox here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0 (not anonymously)<br />3) Download BTC wallet from Mt.Gox (using my private ip adress because there is really much MB - it is danger?)<br />4) Mixing my BTC using TORwallet: http://nci2szjrwjqw2zbi.onion and get back to Mt.Gox<br />5) Withdraw BTC from Mt.Gox to my wallet (using &quot;fake&quot; public ip adress)<br />6) Change in my wallet socks4 proxy to 127.0.0.1, port 9050<br />7) Use TORwallet mixing again<br />8) Send BTC from TORwallet to Bitcoin Fog: http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion<br />9) And now from Bitcoin Fog to SR<br /><br />that is my idea after reading this forum. Do you want it is safe or stupid?&nbsp; Thanks for your opinions.. :)

				No idea about (2), but don&#039;t send anything to Mt. Gox if you don&#039;t have to.<br /><br />(3) Doesn&#039;t make sense.&nbsp; Get a TORwallet account and send it there.&nbsp; Don&#039;t send it back to Mt. Gox!!!<br /><br />You can send to SR from TORwallet after you mixed your coins.&nbsp; If you are feeling real paranoid you can mix through another service as well such as blockchain.info, then send to SR.<br /><br />You can send them to a personal address in your local wallet at any point in the above if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; That is always safe.<br /><br />However, when you send funds from your local wallet, the computers in the bitcoin network that you are connected to will be able to associate that transaction with your IP address.&nbsp; Therefore there is a (very small) chance that these funds will be associated with your IP address if you transmit them from your local wallet.&nbsp; In this case it makes sense to send the transaction through the Tor network.<br /><br />Sending the coins in and out of a local wallet doesn&#039;t really add to your security so I wouldn&#039;t bother.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				thanks for usefull responds. Now I see, my idea was bad and complicated, getting bitcoins isn&#039;t so tought how I meant. Thank Shannon for his link http://bitcoin-otc.com/vieworderbook.php?sortby=id&amp;sortorder=ASC&amp;type=SELL&amp;thing=BTC in different topic. Do you mean it&#039;s danger using Moneybookers or Netteler for buying bitcoins from this people?
