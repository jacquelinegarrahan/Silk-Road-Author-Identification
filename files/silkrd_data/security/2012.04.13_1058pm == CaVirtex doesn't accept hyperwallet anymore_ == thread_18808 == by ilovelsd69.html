				Seriously i&#039;m mad, i have just initiated a bank transfer to hyperwallet and cavirtex announce that he doesn&#039;t take it anymore, i have to retransfer the funds in my bank account. This is the second time this arrives to me, 2 month before i was using mtGox with paxum as a payment provider and paxum has decided to stop funding bitcoins exchange. What are the best options now in Canada to buy bitcoins?????&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />PS: if someone want to sell me bitcoins in exchange of a hyperwallet beam cash transfer please PM me.

				CAVIRTEX will allow you nto use hyperwallet as long as you send them your required photo ID I just transferred 132 bitcoins to hyperwallet friday and then to bitcoin .org wallet so there is no tracing it and then to my silkroad account.If you don&#039;t want to give them the photo ID just go to bitcoin.org and download their wallet set it up and transfer your money there simple solution<br /><br />also if you verify your account with them they will not limit you on your monthly purchases or withdrawls they know where all their bitcoins go I have bought over $4000 worth of coin in 2 months and don&#039;t be alarmed if you call there contact number and you here a Baby in the back ground she runs the company from her home office

				Canadians just get an account on bitcointalk.org and trade in the currency exchange base.<br />Lot&#039;s of people doing trusted EMT-&gt;BTC and vice versa now that canadianbitcoins stopped doing it. Also they are doing hyperwallet<br /><br />Can just sell for cash in person. Make threads on there offering it, if you live in a major city guaranteed somebody will be interested.<br /><br />Bitcoin-central does CAD and does EMT cashout and other Canadian methods.
