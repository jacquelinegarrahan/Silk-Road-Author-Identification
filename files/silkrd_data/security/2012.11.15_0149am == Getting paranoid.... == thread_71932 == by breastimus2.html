				Guys, it&#039;s been like 4 days since a package was marked as in transit via priority mail...Let me get this straight, so if the mail man comes to my door to deliver and asks for a signature, what should I do? Is it normal for USPS to ask for signatures on priority mail?

				Don&#039;t go to the door.&nbsp; When I see the post truck pulling up I go upstairs and pretend I&#039;m taking a shower or something.&nbsp; If something needed a signature then they&#039;ll just leave a little sticky note thing on your door and you can decided what to do from there.&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#039;s no reason to go to the door when the USPS guy comes.

				Ok, so I&#039;m left still unsure of what I should do. From the replies I&#039;m reading here, I get a mixed message. Some same signing for priority mail is not out of the ordinary, others say never to even consider signing for priority mail. I guess I&#039;ll ask this, is it withing normal scope of possibility that a mail man will ask for delivery on priority mail on a package in envelope that&#039;s small enough to be in mail box based on shipper opting for signature or something? I didn&#039;t ask him for tracking, but is it normal that vendors select tracking anyway for their own piece of mind? Is it too late to get a tracking number on this package as I have no way of knowing what&#039;s going on with it? Vendor is not messaging me back on SR and I&#039;m starting to think perhaps I got scammed. If the package doesn&#039;t arrive today, I&#039;m really going to start to freak.

If you have a mail carrier at your door holding a Priority pkg asking for signature..it&#039;s probably not a mailman at all but rather LE.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now...Priority Mail can be supplemented with various extra services that would render that piece of mail &quot;signature required&quot;.&nbsp; The most common extra service added to Priority mail is Delivery Confirmation.&nbsp; Now your pkg is classified as Priority Mail w/Delivery Confirmation.&nbsp; This still is not a &quot;signature required by recipient&quot; piece of mail. If you want to send Priority Mail that requires the addressee to sign.. the PO offers a few options that will cost a few dollars extra. Signature Confirmation/Certified Mail/Registered Mail/Certificate of Mailing for example. Obviously, it&#039;s a bad idea all around for these signature required extras to be used on drug packages.&nbsp; Aside from providing documentation of taking possession of contraband they bring extra/added attention to your mail.&nbsp; The idea is to blend in not stand out.&nbsp; As a seller I would have to question any buyer requesting his pkg be sent signature required.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a buyer, I&#039;d have to wonder about any vendor who sends pkgs out requiring signature.<br /><br />

				no, not normal for priority shipping as the above poster said. is required on some forms of express shipping however.<br /><br />you can either avoid the postman and reschedule the delivery signing the slip they give you, go pick it up or just sign for it.<br /><br />perhaps your vendor used a different shipping method without informing you? <br /><br />i wouldn&#039;t really worry about the signature, i&#039;ve done it a couple times for SR purchases and for other random stuff. NBD. i suggest you get to know your postman though if you&#039;re gonna be having him deliver your drugs, me and my dude are homies.

				Don&#039;t sign for it, and be there when postman shows up or they card for pickup and later you have to go show ID and be on camera somewhere picking it up. Don&#039;t open it immediately, wait and look around. Cops where I live put in wireless alarm in the package and wait for sucker to open it after he accepts package, then they burst in and raid the place. Before you open it make sure computer is encrypted and turned OFF/no power, clean house, and then open it.<br /><br />4 day wait is totally normal it&#039;s the post office, shit always happens<br /><br /><br />

				Signing for a package is not the same as signing a confession.&nbsp; Before I became interested in my mail, I would have been happy to sign for any package a mailman asked me to sign for - even if I had absolutely no idea what it was or where it was from.&nbsp; If police attempt a controled delievery, signing for the package might be suspicious, and might lead to your house being searched, but it is hardly proof of your intention to recieve drugs in the mail. <br /><br />If your house is clean, and you can handle (not)talking to cops, I would say don&#039;t stress about signing, even if the vendor says you won&#039;t have to, the PO fucks stuff up all the time.&nbsp; I once had a mailman refuse to give my package to my stepdad, because he thought I moved out, even though the vendor had checked the no signature box.

A lot of my customers request tracking. If you were in trouble it wouldn&#039;t be the postman at your door asking for a signature, it would be the cops. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it mate. Unless it&#039;s a massive package, customs are just going to bin it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are a shitty vendor then. You also have obviously never done any research about how controlled deliveries go down. Here is a hint, it is a cop dressed as a postman.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In some cases, like international mail, you have a choice of either getting mail with a tracking number that needs a signature when delivered, or getting mail that you cant track and doesn&#039;t need a signature. I don&#039;t think there is an option for tracking international mail without needing to sign, which sucks because if you get the kind without a tracking number, its easy for a seller or buyer to scam. But for USA domestic mail, you shouldn&#039;t need a signature for priority, and express mail has the option of waiving the signature. My favorite vendor ships express to me a lot and always waives the signature.
