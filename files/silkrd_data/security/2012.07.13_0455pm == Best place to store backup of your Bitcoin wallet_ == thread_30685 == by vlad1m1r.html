				Dear all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been asked a question by an SR user about where to store back ups for your Bitcoin wallet?<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken a look at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet#Backup suggests using Wuala over other cloud storage providers as the service doesn&#039;t store copies of your encryption keys. I understand it&#039;s now possible to encrypt your wallet with a passphrase.<br /><br />My suggestion for what it was worth was to place the wallet.dat file inside a Truecrypt container, protected with a sufficiently complex password and most importantly a key file (http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=keyfiles) and only then use a cloud based storage service.<br /><br />The alternative of course is just to back up your wallet on to a thumb drive or DVD but of course this wouldn&#039;t be much help if your data was lost or stolen.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing all your thoughts.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				I think the truecrypt idea is best.&nbsp; Create a very small container, put your wallet.dat file in there and email it to yourself using yahoo mail or gmail or whatever.&nbsp; If you use a strong password you have nothing to worry about.&nbsp; <br /><br />Make sure you understand how wallets work thought.&nbsp; Say you have 50BTC in one address, and you backup your wallet.dat file.&nbsp; Then you send 1 BTC to another address, and then your computer crashes.&nbsp; Your backup wallet.dat does NOT protect you in this case.&nbsp; Thats because of the way the way that bitcoin sends coins:<br /><br />You have 50 coins address &quot;A&quot; and backup your wallet.dat file.&nbsp; <br />You send 1 coin to address &quot;B&quot;<br />The other 49 coints in address &quot;A&quot; get sent to addresss &quot;C&quot; that your bitcoin client just created and that you control.&nbsp; Your backup wallet.dat that has the information for address &quot;A&quot; is now worthless.<br /><br /><br />Whenever coins are sent from an address, ALL coins in the address get sent.&nbsp; Some get sent to who you are trying to send them to, the remaining balance gets sent to a new address that you control.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if you want to back something up, be very careful and verify that you are going about it the correct way.<br /><br />

				You can print out your private key/wallet.dat on a piece of paper and put it in a safe. bitcoin armory will help you do this: http://bitcoinarmory.com/

				Can someone give some recommendations on best practice for backing up wallet.dat / BTC back up on Mac as well?<br /><br />It seems neither Electrum or Bitcoinarmoury have functional Mac versions.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve actually had success installing the whole bitcoin installation into a container.<br /><br /><br />Even better might be full disk encryption.

				Personally, I just encrypt my wallet.dat file with PGP and upload the encrypted wallet to google docs (on gmail).<br /><br />I find that the best way. The TrueCrypt container is also a good idea which I&#039;ve used before however, I find it easier to use PGP.
