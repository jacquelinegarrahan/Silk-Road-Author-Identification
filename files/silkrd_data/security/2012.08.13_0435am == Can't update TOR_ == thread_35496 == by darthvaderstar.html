				Go to the TOR website,&nbsp; download and save the TOR Bundle to your computer. Remove the version of Tor your currently using from your system and restart it. Then once it boots up, extract the TOR files to the desired location. Then double click &quot;Start TOR Browser&quot; and you should be able to connect. If that doesn&#039;t work, you may have some malware / spyware on your system disrupting TOR starting or maybe a registry error that requires fixing with a cleaner (good free one is CCleaner).

				You don&#039;t completely install it. You click on &quot;Start TOR Browser&quot; and TOR will start and load the homepage. Ideally, look on the forums for info on creating an encrypted&nbsp; USB stick.<br />That way TOR wont actually be running from the computer but from the encrypted USB stick which can be removed and taken with you or stored when your finished browsing.

				This happened to me!!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I found the solution was to look very carefully at where I had my previous version of Tor installed. It was on my desktop in a Folder called “Tor Browser”. <br />However the new installation had for some reason installed inside this folder in a sub folder named “Tor Browser”.<br /><br />Whenever I used the “Quick Launch” from windows it launched the old version of my Tor browser – which told me that there was a security update available!!! Very strange I thought but continued using it for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />So the secret was to erase the old copy of the Tor Broswer. Remove the Quick Launch link etc. Then go to the new installation and right click on the .exe file and make a new “Quick launch” etc.<br /><br />Now my Tor browser works fine, updated to the latest spec.<br />Hope this helps.&nbsp; :)<br />
