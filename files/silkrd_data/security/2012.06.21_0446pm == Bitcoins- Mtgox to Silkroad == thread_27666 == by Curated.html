				You should have your coins by now amazing777.<br /><br />Check the transaction with blockchain.info<br /><br />Just search for the SR-address you sent the coins too. If there is a deposit with 6 confirmations of the amount you sent, then it should be in SR already. If there isn&#039;t, then you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />And if there is no deposit at all, the coins haven&#039;t moved yet.
