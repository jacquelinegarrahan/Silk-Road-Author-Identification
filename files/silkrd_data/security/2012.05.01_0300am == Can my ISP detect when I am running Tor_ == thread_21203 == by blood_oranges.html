There are some other pro active steps you can take. Heck IT Security is a whole career and study in and of itself. I don&#039;t know about buying a laptop on Craigslist and how that would chage much. You can also create a whole computer in a virtual machine. Basically creating a computer out of thin air that can&#039;t be tracked back to anything. When you reinstall a clean OS on a computer the only thing they can match back is the MAC address. Lots of ways around using a computer anonymously. But using a public hotspot could be of great assistance in that task! <br />&nbsp;

Your traffic is encrypted so there&#039;s no way of knowing what sites you&#039;ve visited.<br /><br />V.

				Yep you&#039;re right about that. I&#039;m just talking about tracking the computer back to the physical owner from purchase that you were hinting at about paying cash for one off of craigslist. That&#039;s all, but yep for sure. They can listen to anything. They just don&#039;t have the ability to read encrypted info like PGP. And I do agree a public hotspot is a great idea! :) Cheers mate!

				Thank you for the replies. Also,a computer created out of thin air sounds super neat.&nbsp;

				There seems to be a lot of paranoia associated with running Tor - personally I run Tor browser both from my home and office address every day from an encrypted USB stick.<br /><br />An analysis of the traffic might well show that I encrypted my traffic and forwarded it to another Tor relay but what good would it do? You can&#039;t even tell the Onion sites someone has visited e.g this forum, let alone retrieve any data about someone&#039;s user name / password.<br /><br />Of course if you are receiving contraband like drugs at your home address you may decide you don&#039;t want to attract any unwanted Police attention but Tor is specifically designed not to be vulnerable to this kind of monitoring - your only worry is if the machine itself is seized which is why it&#039;s vital you encrypt it using a program like Truecrypt.<br /><br />V.
