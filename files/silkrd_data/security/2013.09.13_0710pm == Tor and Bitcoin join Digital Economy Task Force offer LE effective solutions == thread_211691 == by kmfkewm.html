This is a serious problem that requires serious solutions. Our task force will offer balanced, effective solutions for policy makers, law enforcement, regulators and the public.&quot;<br /><br />The Task Force, which launched in August, is not solely focussed on child exploitation. It has developed working groups that aim to combat a range of illicit activities, to safeguard human rights and to encourage inter-agency coordination and law enforcement. It was launched off the back of a report by Thomson Reuters Fraud Prevention and Investigation unit about digital currency laundering.<br /><br />The report detailed how criminal and terrorist organisations have turned to digital currency to reap profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and the dissemination of child abuse images.<br /><br />Steve Rubley, managing director, Government Segment for the Legal business of Thomson Reuters points out that the digital economy provides a plethora of new opportunities and is central to how business is conducted but there are also &quot;dark corners&quot; where drug cartels can easily launder money and human sex traffickers operate in near obscurity.<br /><br />The Task Force will include the Bitcoin Foundation, The Tor Project, Trend Micro, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Cato Institute, The Brookings Institute, the US Agency for International Development and Vital Voices. The group will educate the public and work collaboratively across stakeholder groups including government agencies, law enforcement, academia, NGOs and industry.<br /><br />A statement released by Thomson Reuters and ICMEC said: &quot;The approach will be a balanced view of both the advantages and disadvantages surrounding the digital economy -- a place where people can enjoy the convenience of digital currencies, but where there are controls in place to regulate them like any other form of money.&quot;<br /><br />The Digital Economy Task Force will produce a report in February 2014 which will aim to inform lawmakers globally about the current state of the digital economy and help people understand the risks associated with it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I am unapologetically pro-censorship in the sense that everyone has a right to control their own property however they want. I would personally never knowingly host cp, since I&#039;m against it, just as I would never knowingly host shock/violent images and videos, but I don&#039;t think the government should be dictating whether you are allowed to view such images. If we banned all speech that offended / emotionally harmed someone, there wouldn&#039;t be much speech left. A woman with an uncovered face offends some people.<br /><br />The more important point is that the same technology protects both the pedos and the druggies. So you can view the mass shutdown of cp sites in onionland as the canary in the coal mine. Right now it looks like the canary has died, and that doesn&#039;t look good for us.<br />

I believe the number they came to was over 10,000 and that did NOT include regulations.&nbsp; I believe it was stated that the average person, just going about their everyday business, breaks a half-dozen laws each day, without realizing it.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you further realize that the U.S. government, under certain circumstances, also enforces foreign laws, you end up with some truly Kafkaesque situations, like the following: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Case Studies CASE STUDIES | McNab v. United States<br />A Lobster Tale: Invalid Foreign Laws Lead to Years in U.S. Prison<br /><br />(November 2003 Case Study)<br /><br />The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to take the case of four businesspeople sent to prison for importing lobster tails from Honduras. Their convictions are predicated on supposed violations of the Lacey Act, which makes it a crime to import “fish or wildlife taken … in violation of any foreign law.” Here, the foreign laws are Honduran fishing regulations that have been declared null and void in Honduras, but are somehow still being enforced by American federal courts.<br /><br />Prison for Caribbean Spiny Lobsters<br /><br />It all began with a supposed anonymous fax to the National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS) on February 3, 1999. The mystery fax alleged that Honduran businessman David McNab had a shipment of “undersized (3 &amp; 4oz) lobster tails” scheduled to arrive in Bayou La Batre, Alabama on February 5, 1999. The fax also said that the lobster should be packed in cardboard boxes, but was in fact packed in clear plastic bags.<br /><br />Based on this strange, anonymous message, NMFS agents waited for McNab’s ship and captured it on arrival. With no explanation, the federal government held the entire ship for several weeks and then off-loaded and transported McNab’s 70,000 pounds of Caribbean spiny lobster to a government freezer in Florida. There the lobster tails languished for six months while NMFS agents searched Honduran regulations for some reason to keep the lobster meat and prosecute the importers and distributors.<br /><br />After numerous phone calls, letters, and trips to Honduras, the NMFS focused on three provisions. The first details the processing and packaging of fish harvested in Honduran waters. This 1993 regulation, promulgated pursuant to a 1973 statute, included the mention of packaging in cardboard boxes. The second regulation prohibits harvesting any lobsters with tails shorter than 5.5 inches. This must have surprised the NMFS agents, since the market price lists published by NMFS include prices for two and three ounce Caribbean spiny lobsters from Honduras. A government expert acknowledged at trial that these little lobsters would all have tails shorter than 5.5 inches. The third Honduran provision prohibits destroying or harvesting “eggs, or the offspring of fish, chelonians or other aquatic species for profit.”<br /><br />Six months after sending them to the cooler, NMFS agents finally began to inspect the locked-up lobster tails. Only about three percent of the lobster tails turned out to be less than 5.5 inches long. Just seven percent showed any evidence of having been egg-bearing lobsters. These small amounts belie the suggestion that McNab or his employees were intentionally harvesting young or egg-bearing lobsters. Nevertheless, prosecutors included these regulations as predicates for alleged violations of the Lacey Act.<br /><br />Charges based on the size and egg-harvesting regulations would only allow NMFS to seize the small portions of lobster tails that were under 5.5 inches or showed evidence of bearing eggs. This, apparently, was not enough. Because all the lobsters were in clear plastic bags instead of cardboard boxes, the government declared the entire shipment illegal and formally seized all 70,000 pounds of lobster tails.<br /><br />Government prosecutors, not satisfied even with 35 tons of lobster, filed criminal charges against McNab. The also charged three American businesspeople who frequently purchased and distributed lobster tails from McNab. All charges against McNab and most charges against the others were predicated on the three Honduran regulations, applied through the Lacey Act. No charges were ever brought against the defendants in Honduras. &nbsp;The alleged Lacey Act violations served primarily to trigger more serious charges. If importing the lobster in bags instead of boxes was illegal, prosecutors reasoned, then planning to import it was criminal conspiracy, the actual importation was smuggling, and payments became felony money laundering. <br /><br />At the District Court’s foreign law hearing, McNab presented copious evidence showing that the Honduran regulations at issue were invalid. The size restriction had never been signed by the President of Honduras, an absolute requirement for such a regulation under Honduran law. The Attorney General of Honduras supplied an opinion, confirming other testimony, that because the size restriction was not signed it could never have had the force of law.<br /><br />McNab presented other witnesses, including a former Honduran Minister of Justice, who testified that the egg harvesting regulation was never intended to apply to animals that happened to bear eggs when caught. The prohibition against harvesting or destroying eggs for profit was meant to do just that, to prevent the harvesting of eggs themselves (turtle eggs in particular).<br /><br />Government prosecutors somehow convinced the court to ignore McNab’s extensive evidence and instead accept the testimony of a single, mid-level Honduran bureaucrat, Liliana Paz. For reasons that remain unexplained, the “Secretary-General” of the Honduran Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock – an official whose primary duty is to be “an instrument of communication” and who has no expertise or authority to render legal opinions – boldly testified that all the regulations were valid and had the force of law.<br /><br />Despite the obvious lack of criminal intent on the part of the defendants, as well as concerns about the validity of the Honduran regulations, all four businesspeople were convicted on a general verdict. In August 2001, McNab and two businessmen were each sentenced to eight years in prison. The fourth defendant, a businesswoman from New Jersey who resold seafood to restaurants like Red Lobster, was sentenced to two years in prison.<br /><br />The government trumpeted the convictions in press releases that labeled McNab “the ringleader of a smuggling operation.” The reports mislead the public by suggesting that McNab was intentionally harvesting undersized and egg-bearing lobsters, never mentioning that these were a tiny portion of his catch. The government fails to note that the only reason for declaring the entire shipment illegal was that it was packed in bags, not boxes. In effect, the defendants were convicted of smuggling because they packed lobster in clear plastic bags instead of opaque cardboard boxes.<br /><br />A press release issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the agency that includes the NMFS, implies that McNab’s business success was part of his wrongdoing. NOAA points out that McNab owns a “fleet of vessels, each of which can deploy thousands of lobster traps,” as if this, in itself, is somehow a wrongful act. Striking an even more bizarre note, NOAA declares that “[t]he wealth from McNab’s vast harvest was denied to the common citizens of Honduras.” McNab, a Honduran citizen, is apparently not “common” enough for the Sandinistas at NOAA.<br /><br />After sentencing, the court was prepared to allow all four defendants to remain free pending their appeals. Federal prosecutors objected to allowing a foreigner like McNab to remain free on bond and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sent him to prison. McNab is now in his fourth year of incarceration.<br /><br />On Appeal before the 11th Circuit, two of the three appellate judges effectively declared Honduras a banana republic, unfit to construe its own laws. The Court decided that it would be unwise to disagree with the prosecutors’ interpretation of the foreign law, citing the “political question” doctrine. This ignored the holdings of other Circuits and the proper role of appellate courts in general. Even worse, the two judges asserted that Honduran officials could not be trusted because they might be bribed or manipulated. Somehow this failed to undermine the credibility of Ms. Paz, the mid-level Honduran bureaucrat who testified for the prosecution. In the interests of “finality,” the Circuit Court upheld the lower court on every issue, no doubt because if just one of the three Honduran regulations was found to be invalid, all of the convictions would fail.<br /><br />The decision of the 11th Circuit is only more troubling when considered in light of the critical new evidence that emerged from Honduras during and after the trial. After the foreign law hearing, McNab had filed an action in the Honduran Court of First Instance of Administrative Law challenging the size restriction. Several months after the end of the criminal trial, the Honduran Court formally held that the size limit was void and declared that it had never had the force of law.<br /><br />McNab’s attorneys also discovered that the law authorizing the packaging regulations was repealed in 1995. Under Honduran law, a regulation is automatically repealed when the authorizing statute is repealed. Even the prosecution’s witness from the Honduran Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock admitted this in an affidavit. It also became clear that the egg-harvesting provision had been repealed in a way that, under Honduran law, operated retroactively.<br /><br />McNab additionally filed a motion before the Honduran National Human Rights Commissioner challenging Ms. Paz’s testimony about Honduran law. The National Human Rights Commissioner, Dr. Leo Valladares, is an internationally respected constitutional lawyer and human rights advocate. His office in Honduras is charged with addressing complaints that government officials’ actions constitute “legal error.” Dr. Valladares issued a report, which the Minister of Agriculture signed, stating that Ms. Paz’s testimony constituted “an error of law.” The scholarly report found that the packaging regulation was repealed in 1995, the size restriction had “never had the force of law,” and that the egg-bearing provision had been retroactively repealed.<br /><br />The government of Honduras, through its embassy, directed all of this information to the U.S. State Department, asking that they forward it directly to the Department of Justice. The Attorney General of Honduras also filed an amicus curiae brief with the 11th Circuit, providing this information and explaining that McNab and the other businesspeople had not violated any Honduran law. All of this was ignored by the Court of Appeals when they concluded that “finality” was, apparently, more important than justice.<br /><br />The prosecution of four businesspeople for normal business activities highlights the dangerous but growing trend to expand criminal liability against normal social and economic conduct. Historically, a criminal conviction required proof of criminal intent (mens rea; a guilty mind) in addition to the wrongful infliction of harm (actus reus; a bad act). Even if the Honduran statutes had not turned out to be uniformly invalid, there was never any evidence that showed the businesspeople acted with criminal intent. Rather the evidence seems to prove that they were simply engaged in catching and selling seafood in a way that any businessperson would consider lawful.<br /><br />This prosecution also reveals the risks of federalizing criminal law. Observers have long warned against allowing the federal government to encroach on the traditional state function of enacting and enforcing general criminal laws. Here, the federal government, through the Lacey Act, claims to enforce foreign laws against foreign and U.S. citizens. These regulations were not made by the U.S. Congress or by some executive agency, but by a foreign government with unfamiliar procedures. If the government of Honduras had actually believed these regulations to be valid, they were free to bring charges. Instead, the U.S. government prosecuted a case on what turned out to be bad law.<br /><br />Each of the four defendants was trying only to earn a living through normal commercial activity when an anonymous accusatory fax sent the U.S. government to destroy their lives. David McNab waits in prison to see if his appeal to the court of last resort will even take the case. Three other businesspeople wait anxiously for the decision that could save them or send them to prison for years. <br /><br />Source: http://www.overcriminalized.com/CaseStudy/McNab-Imprison-by-Foreign-Laws.aspx<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br /><br />

Where I would differ with you is that you may not understand how the laws are interpreted and drafted. When most people think of child pornography, they think in terms of images of children being raped. Most people would not think of Anime or Manga, nor would they consider text-only stories. In Canada, ALL of these are child pornography. SInce our child pornography law was originally passed in 1993, it has been revised multiple times, to make it increasingly harsh.&nbsp; Several years back, the &quot;artistic merit&quot; defence was removed.&nbsp; Eli Langer, a noted visual artist, had a display at Toronto&#039;s Mercer Union art gallery; the gallery was raided, and the artwork seized as the paintings and drawings involved adult/child sex. Langer&#039;s intent was to graphically display the horror of child sexual abuse, but his intent was irrelevant -- he was still prosecuted under Section 163.1 of the Criminal Code, Canada&#039;s child pornography law. <br /><br />The Canadian artistic community rallied around Langer, who was acquitted, as his works were proven to have artistic merit. Were Langer to do a similar show today, he would be convicted, as the law no longer allows for an artistic merit defence.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even in the U.S., there have been convictions for Anime/Manga. <br /><br />Perhaps most shocking of all is the McCoy case. The McCoy case is the first successful conviction for text-only obscenity in over 35 years, since Miller v. California, in 1973. <br /><br />Earlier this year, Frank Russell McCoy was convicted in Georgia Federal Court of obscenity. He wrote a series of stories (NOT illustrated, text-only) involving explicit sexual activity between adults and children. Mr. McCoy is a resident of Minnesota -- the Feds tried having him prosecuted in his home state, and failed. Even in Georgia, they had to judge-shop -- trying no less than 3 judges before they would find one that would sign an arrest warrant. <br /><br />He has now been sentenced to 18 months in prison, and followed by two years of probation, for writing stories, which were distributed over the Internet. McCoy&#039;s stories included disclaimers, describing the types of content to be found in the stories, so no one who read them would be caught unaware. The judge actually argued in his judgment, that the very existence of these disclaimers was evidence that McCoy knew that the stories were obscene.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think what the Feds were after in this case was to enable the judging of materials as &quot;obscene&quot; by the standards of the most restrictive jurisdiction they could find in the United States, thus effectively doing away with the idea of &quot;community standards&quot;. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=211691.msg1536284#msg1536284">Quote from: astor on September 14, 2013, 01:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The more important point is that the same technology protects both the pedos and the druggies.

So you can have one or the other, either we protect people from speech that may emotionally disturb or offend someone, including the victims of child sexual abuse and of violence who appear in gore pics, or we allow it, but allowing one and not the other is irrational and hypocritical.

				This doesn&#039;t make sense. Why would the Tor Project or the Bitcoin foundation get involved in this? I know I&#039;m looking at this from the perspective of a SR user but doesn&#039;t teaming up with a group such as mentioned go against all the values that Tor and Bitcoin foundation stand for? <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s a keep your friends close but your enemies closer? The only good news I summarized from that article is that it&#039;s basically on the first stage which is research so everyone can calm down for the time being. It will be interesting to see what the Tor developers have to say in light of this article. After Feb. 2014 depending on their findings it could potentially be the end of SR. Well on Tor anyays. <br /><br />Good find btw to OP. Some network geniuses here should make the next new and improved &#039;Tor&#039; *cough* Astor *cough *Kmf*

When you and your partner get openly harassed by the USA and you have to flee to Germany to stop it, then you don&#039;t help them to make the harassment even easier.

				I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re trying to say? The feds managed to get the &#039;pedos&#039; and arrest the Freedom hosting creator without the Tor developers getting involved. Tor getting involved with the new so called &#039;Digital Economy Task Force&#039; seems half ass backwards to me. So because some &#039;pedos&#039; used Tor to view child porn does that make Tor inherently evil and by way of showing a co-operative gesture the developers think that this is the best mode. Ok sure then with that logic all gun makers in the US should attend the funerals of any person that&#039;s killed by a gun in the US. I&#039;m waiting for someone to chime in here and say &#039;Oh well not everyone uses Tor to buy drugs you dope fiend!&#039;.... yeah well I&#039;ll guess see after Feb. 2014 and btw don&#039;t forget that Tor gets about 60% of their development money from the Department of Defense:<br /><br />CLEARNET: https://fowlchicago.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/tor-project-2012-financial-report-60-of-our-funding-comes-from-the-u-s-government/

				I don&#039;t think we should be overly alarmed yet.&nbsp; The bottom line is that both the Tor folks and the Bitcoin folks are not going to simply stop doing what they do because the govt has asked nicely.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I were them, I&#039;d be there to explain that Tor like the larger Internet can be misused, and that authority should go after the worst offenders (preferably the scumbag CP perveyors and not SR)...but the basic freedom to have anonymized Internet or currency exchange is not open for debate and has many uses (such as helping dissidents in authoratarian regimes, journalists, governments, etc).<br /><br />They&#039;ll be there to say you can&#039;t have the good without the bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />My bet is that at the end of this task forces deliberations...there will be the exact same cards on the table as we have now.<br /><br />R.

				It will be difficult to attack Bitcoins because Germany and other countries consider it legal.<br />It will be more difficult,&nbsp; but not impossible, to backdoor Tor code because of increased scrutiny.<br /><br />I suspect there will be efforts to limit &quot;Excess security enhancements&quot; that provide more security or anonymity <br />for terrorists, child porn&#039;ers, drug dealers,&nbsp; rum runners and personal liberty fanatics. <br /><br />

They have a vested interest in keeping their vendors and buyers alike safe. However at the end of the day SR is still hosted on Tor and there&#039;s only so much you can do to protect yourself in a hostile environment. If Tor does in fact become comprised or is than that would be the equivalent of you securing your pc, setting up firewalls, routers, and using PGP to find out that your ISP is spying on all your communications. Even then if your taking proper precautions you could potentially not suffer any adverse consequences.

Consider a couple of things; first, of course these organizations are going to join &quot;Digital Economy Task Force&quot;. They are actually legitimate groups with legitimate causes beyond allowing us to buy drugs anonymously. Could you imagine the kind of public-relations backlash Tor or Bitcoin might receive if they refused? It could stop either project in their tracks as it could start the narrative that they are part of the problem in the first place. And what exactly do they mean by &#039;Bitcoin&#039; anyhow? It&#039;s a peer-to-peer currency, not a single organization with sole control. Second; anything that weakens anonymity on Tor makes Tor obsolete, so I seriously doubt that if Tor is to be weakened in any way it will not be through publicly known groups like this, it will be in secret without anyone knowing until the next Snowden leaks it. Lastly; although I don&#039;t let it effect the care I put into going places like SR, I seriously doubt LE is actually much interested in online drug deals, any more than they are interested in street deals. It&#039;s all just an excuse for funding and powers - IRL powers and now digital-domain powers. DPR? Yeah, they probably want him/her. Buyers/sellers? We&#039;re just pawns deliberately left out so there&#039;ll always be a boogieman to scare the straights for funding...<br /><br />I&#039;ll be keeping an eye out and watching my back, but just keep cleaver - they only want to catch low-hanging fruit. Make it hard and even if they could catch you with effort, the effort would not be worth the rewards...
