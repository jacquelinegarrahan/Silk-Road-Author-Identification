				Paypal are rather jealous about people trading in digital currencies beside their own and don&#039;t allow the buying/selling of Bitcoins via their system.<br /><br />A potential loophole used by some eBay sellers is to send a CD with a Bitcoin wallet on it which would amount to a physical product but would further undermine the anonymity afforded by trading in BTC. I have been asked to do this before but I have a 6 year old seller account on eBay and really don&#039;t want to tarnish that reputation - how would you know someone isn&#039;t using a stolen CC to fund their payment to you after all?<br /><br />V.
