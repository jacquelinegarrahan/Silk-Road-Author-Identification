				Sorry, I used the search function but couldn&#039;t find anyone with my specific question....<br /><br />So I&#039;ve decided to step up my security efforts, and one of the things I wanted to start doing was having my coins bounce between a wallet or 2 after using bitinstant and before making it to their final destination. My coins made it to a blockchain wallet, but it says the transaction is unconfirmed(its been over an hour.) One of the things I found out from my search is that blockchain seems to be reputable, so I&#039;m not afraid of getting robbed, but I&#039;m just wondering how long it will be until they confirm it. Its not that big of an issue, I&#039;d much rather be safe than sorry, but I&#039;m curious because really wanted to try to put my orders in tonight....

				First, smart move using blockchain. I feel like not enough people around here take the extra hour or so to properly launder their BC. <br /><br />To answer your question, for me it typically takes 30-45 minutes, but I wouldn&#039;t be concerned unless it would be over 3 hours.&nbsp; I am very aware how frustrating those final steps can be, but worth it in the long run. <br /><br />- General Petreaus

				Has it made it into a block yet? If you don&#039;t include any fees then miners don&#039;t have any incentive to encode your transaction into the block chain, and it may float around for a bit before being written to the chain. Annoying but happens sometimes, if you want a speedy transaction it&#039;s best to include a fee.
