				Jack. Just a little heads up. Chikun is a reference to LTC, not BTC. Sure, you can call any crypto currency &#039;chikun&#039; if you want, but we&#039;re professionals here, aren&#039;t we? At least I know I sure fuckin&#039; am. <br /><br />But seriously, arizzeeeee CHIKUN! ARRRIIIIZE! CHIKUN! FUCKING ARIIIIIIZE!<br /><br />I&#039;ve got 40k+ sitting in LTC trying to ride this Shitcoin crash out. I&#039;m sorry Jack, but I don&#039;t believe we&#039;ve seen the bottom just yet.

				I&#039;ve been researching Bitcoin cause it fascinates me. The most they (governments) can do is make it go underground which I have a feeling we will see in the some what distant future what does that basically mean? The banks, financial intuitions would not be allowed to have anything to do with the Bicoin currency as a matter of law or regulation.<br /><br />You can&#039;t shut the currency down, you can&#039;t stop it, thats about the strongest action they can take against it. When it does go underground there will always be a way to obtain it and to cash it out it just won&#039;t be the way it is now with official trading companies it will be via underground trading on the dark net.

				I wonder what would happen to poor old bitcoin if SR disappeared tomorrow (not that I want that to happen, just hypothetically) :p<br /><br />And @DoctorWalterB, I believe its likely to continue going down in price, be patient before hoarding or you&#039;ll get investors remorse ;)

				OH GOD.. i hate threads like this.. <br /><br />dont sweat it!! it will come back up!! yeah sure it prolly will but to make a thread talking about it is absurd..<br /><br />just like the guys who bought at 200 dollars a coin.. and still think.. OH IM ALRIGHT IT WILL RISE AGAIN.. GTFO <br /><br />your speculating you dont know shit for sure.. ur just wishful thinking cuz everyone knows bitcoin is to unstable to be certain about anything <br /><br />especially the rise and fall.. <br /><br />get ur coins.. buy drugs .. and quit trying to invest is my advice.. ive seen people loose a lot.. and for anyone to make the same mistake after everyone lost soooo much.. <br />is just being a DUMB CUNT.. <br /><br />learn from others mistakes.. dont be another fuck ass that is sitting here with half there money gone cuz they thought they were on to the next big thing.. <br /><br />god..

				I can&#039;t say definitively if I believe it&#039;ll come back up or not. I am betting that it will rise in the long-term, as it is honestly a viable option for those looking to transfer money quickly, internationally, and with at least some kind of anonymity.<br /><br />The protocol cannot be &quot;shut down&quot; because of the same reasons you can&#039;t shut down a torrent network - it&#039;s peer to peer, not server to client. Also, BTC and other cryptocurrencies will never be SR only. It&#039;s popular on SR, it&#039;s popular in part because of SR, but there are many non-shady uses for Bitcoin that have real-world application.

				No Thelorax.&nbsp; I know for sure.&nbsp; I don&#039;t sweat it at all.&nbsp; As long as no other crypto currency takes over which I very highly doubt will happen then bitcoins will be higher than we&#039;ve ever seen in the future.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean anytime soon but I really don&#039;t care.&nbsp; You have to understand supply and demand and the very small market cap bitcoins have.&nbsp; You also have to understand about mining difficulty and electricity costs but supply and demand has more to do with it.&nbsp; The more widely adopted it is and the more people that want bitcoins, the higher the price will go.&nbsp; We&#039;re still at the very beginning stage&nbsp; here and the market cap is very small.

				The only&nbsp; reason im sweating it is because, i bought my most recent stash of BTC at around 105USD and i cant buy anymore! LocalBTC isnt a viable option and all my others (bitinstant, BST, bitfloor etc.) are not avail ATM...

				I suspect the drop is partly due to the fact that Bitcoins aren&#039;t 100% anonymous, and the sale of anonymous Bitcoins is being restricted, so its harder to obtain bitcoins.&nbsp; Use the system.&nbsp; More than 100,000 people have set up accounts to buy and sell Bitcoins at places like MtGox, and most of them fund it by wire from their bank account for investment reasons. I would guess that a series of $500 purchases would get a lot more attention than a single $5000 wire transfer.&nbsp; Then you can hide in the noise and buy or sell bitcoins to your hearts content.&nbsp; You can also transfer some coins to your personal ewallet for personal purchases.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I think in six months, the price will again be around $100 unless everyone decides they would rather get drugs the old way.

				LC is correct in his assertion that the difficulty of buying BTC in some countries is holding back the potential of the currency, making it a niche market. Maybe it won&#039;t last. Everyone used to pay for drugs on the internet with e-gold, now it&#039;s BTC. Maybe something new will appear in a few years.

				I invested about 1000 dollars in BTC back when it was 90 a coin right after the drop in april. I shouldve sold when it went up to 150 again a few weeks later. Oh well. I ended up spending all 1000 on drugs, but due to the exchange rate being about 10 or 20 dollars higher than when i initially invested, I was able to get my drugs at a pretty discounted price. I also sold about 50% of my drugs. Overall, i&#039;m saying I prob got like 500$&nbsp; worth of drugs for myself for the price of 100-200 due to my business maneuvers, so i&#039;m happy lol. I prob won&#039;t end up investing again though haha. once I already have the BTC it&#039;s too tempting to spend them lol
