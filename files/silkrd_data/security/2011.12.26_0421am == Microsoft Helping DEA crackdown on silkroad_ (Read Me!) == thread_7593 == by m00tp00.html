				background:<br /><br />What happens, When navigating normally through the tor network to none .onion addreses nothing seemed to change. But as soon as I headed to silkroad. I get a pop up. Saying something along the lines of &quot;Microsoft would like to send a sample of your program for further review....blah blah&quot; &quot;Un check this to not send this sample&quot;. The app listed was showing tor vidalia bundle. I found this very interesting as I have never had that message until today, and sure enough; A update was installed today. <br /><br />New update, Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.117.1627.0)<br /><br />Installation date: ‎12/‎25/‎2011 6:53 PM<br /><br />Installation status: Successful<br /><br />Update type: Important<br /><br />i know i am paranoid hippy .. but i think everyone should be just a careful. I will be doing some network analysis of this and try to see if my hypothesis is correct... Im asking everyone to not install this update in the mean time.<br /><br />Im also asking if other people&nbsp; to let me know if the see any similar message. This is very very important for me to help look into this. <br /><br /><br /><br />And remember <br /><br />1. Disk encryption&nbsp; &gt; truecrypt&nbsp; &nbsp;--- Or use live cd.<br />2. File shredders<br />3. tor :P<br />4. Use different forum name than your SR login. and pass<br />5. Ironkey flashdrives - check em out. good for clean truecrypt partition. . &lt;--recommended.<br />6. Always delete messages after read. ---in case of break into database<br />7. PGP emails!!!<br />8. If yous l33t ... l2 proxy chains<br />9. What happens on the net, stays on the net.<br />10. Wait a day or so until you open your product. Trust me, this does help even though it sounds ghey. :P<br />11. If your a dealer, Use latex gloves when handle products / envelopes ext. DEA does create accounts to place orders so they can try to get DNA off of goodies. In fact. DEA reading this right now, and taking note :P. ...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />12. Change bit-coin address through sr profile management. Send bitcoins from your exchanger to instawallets&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12a.(pro status = break up amounts to different&nbsp; instawallets. Send all the funds from all the different instawallets into another instawallet and send here.&nbsp; <br /><br />ex. {<br />5btc<br />mtgox&nbsp; 2 btcs &gt; instawallet1<br />mtgox 3 btcs &gt;instawallet2 <br /><br />instawallet1 2 btcs &gt; instawallet3<br />instawallet2 3 btcs &gt; instawallet3<br /><br />instawallet &gt; SR wallet<br /><br />rinse and repeat for every transaction. make new accts, etc...<br />}<br />* if you are really paranoid you can just create your own style. but this is how i get my btcs. <br />13. Another thing that helps, break into neighbors wiFi, or use cafe shops / any public internutz. <br />14. Also, rename your computer every once in a while. <br />15. Optional, read up on counter surveillance/ anti forensics. <br /><br /><br /><br />Wanna help / questions ? PM me<br /><br />be safe.<br />have fun.<br /><br /><br />Long live silkr0ad. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Seems a bit odd to me. Windows defender is Microsoft&#039;s antivirus program. Maybe you are infected with a virus that infected your vidalia installation?

				Trust me, I am not infected. This was a alert from windows defender. And im running win7 on vbox. Only things installed are wireshark, and visual c++ with my written programs. Very highly doubtful that i am infected. <br /><br />&nbsp;I did a system restore to dec, 16. last time this vb was on. Updated again, and got the same message. only after the update was installed.

				Most likely after antivirus definition update the vidalia setup was found as suspicious. As the setup file is identical for all users, it&#039;s not a problem. But never use automatic updates, the windows genuine advantage was good example why not.<br /><br />1. TrueCrypt is silver bullet. Use it on System Drive! LiveCD is inconvenient. That&#039;s my opinion, your requirements may vary.<br />2. No need for shredders if drive is already encrypted with TrueCrypt. Shredding alone is not guaranteed to remove all traces of activity.<br />3. Tor!<br />4. Pass different, name the same. Even sellers use the name on forum. Helps build reputation.<br />5. I will never trust proprietary hardware encryption devices. There already exist examples of badly implemented crypto on usb sticks. TrueCrypt are cheaper and safer.<br />6. You should never send any personal info without GPG encryption. The database can be compromised anytime... or never!<br />7. PGP e-mails!<br />8. some proxy chains are in fact honeypot or otherwise insecure. Tor will do the job!<br />9. What&#039;s anonymous and encrypted, stays anonymous and encrypted! Where is the Las Vegas?<br />10. Bad advice. If you will receive unexpected package from unknown person, you will no try to know what&#039;s inside? Wait for a few days so cops can get the warrant and visit your house with weed still sitting in a package? Better receive packages at some other address. Make a hobo do the job for you.<br />11. Yes, smart sellers already are using gloves etc. DEA, as you read this, try to enforce a baton up in to your ass!<br />12. Instawallets are web service, who can log all the transactions at will. Sending coins to your computer keeps the recipient (your) address even more secret.<br />13. Good. Change the MAC address of your WiFi network card, so the router logs will show the fake address.<br />14. Use a popular and generic name, such as computer or admin. Renaming computer can sometime cause all sorts of problems.<br />15. True, good starting point are http://www.anti-forensics.com/

				Ok, the error message came about when i right-clicked tor and ran as admin. The message has yet to pop up since i clicked the do not send radio button. Also , i tried looking for the message computer management. ( Right click computer -&gt; manage) , nothing was found. Once / if i can replicate this error, i will upload ss. <br /><br /><br />-- Thanks for the adds/ commentary SierraRS.

				- it wouldnt be advisable to install / use microsoft windows defender {windows and windows} as its their product and they are likely to put in and introduce exceptions<br />&nbsp; when it suits them, exceptions for processes and modules that they would like to continue subversively do whatever the module has been designed to do.

If it&#039;s too much of a hassle to reboot whenever you want to work securely, just use a VM.

But the LiveUSB solution has the great advantage of being portable.

				For the purposes of SR as long as you take some reasonable security precautions (TrueCrypt to paranoid levels and limit your SR interaction to a portable VM on a USB stick) the OS doesn&#039;t really matter if they can&#039;t access the filesystem (i.e. TrueCrypt) to retrieve forensic data. While lots of network traffic is monitored using things like tor as well as https everywhere make it fairly useless to try and police peoples internet activity given the amount of resources it would take on behalf of the DEA.<br /><br />Long live SR!!! :)
