				Hi SR,<br /><br />If someone wanted to clean money through bitcoin, howto?<br />Talking about btc not from SR but newly deposited.<br /><br />What would you suggest?<br />Can current laundry&#039;s/mixers support 1-2k+ daily btc volume?<br />What exchangers do you guys suggest? How to get money in-and-out as fast as possible?<br /><br />lots of questions so I would be very thankful if someone could give me some insights.<br /><br />Thanks

				I guess you have to find a btc exchange that will deposit your funds to a Swiss or Caribbean bank account. I have no idea how it would work.<br /><br />This is an interesting subject, just for curiosity. I&#039;m gonna follow this topic

				Ahhh my favourite type of work. <br /><br />Ok basically if you are doing $3000+ per calender month and need a solid solution that you can rely on for the long term then you should come to me. However I only work with vendors I can vet before hand and I generally require 50+ sales for you to be considered, I will still look through your feedback and info on the forums anyway and I&#039;ll let you know if we can go forward. My fees are 100BTC for a basic consultation, 150 for an advanced consultation and 250BTC for a bespoke corporate structure that will be tailored to fit your specific needs. I do require a few details from those I work with but this is generally to establish which type of package you need, most fall into the first two categories. <br /><br />If you want a quick solution or are searching for cash then definitely use Vlad, he&#039;s experienced and solid. You wont go wrong with him.<br /><br />Either way you will be in good hands, it just depends which you need. If you want a chat let me know. :)<br /><br />Lim

				I suggest that you start by reading the definition of laundering and understand what laundering actually is. Plus, if you have money like that then you need to pay for advice. No one is going to help you cash out your ill gotten gains..........for free.

				Indeed, this is far from a hobby or something you can learn in an afternoon, it&#039;s an industry within itself with many different branches that you have to work out in which one you need. You have to take it as seriously as the business that generates the funds you need to wash and it annoys the fuck out of me when people think the cheap DIY solutions are sufficient.

				Have you read the rest of the thread? That was basicly my question. ;)<br /><br />Use bitcoinfog or SR as a mixer so you get other coins back. If your bitcoins come from selling on SR you are probably safe but you could use bitcoinfog as an extra layer of security.<br />Personally I would not use bitchain.info&nbsp; if your coins are traceable to you(if you bought them through mxt gox using your real info for example) as they are not an anonymous operation themselves, they could get a subpoena so a new transaction could be logged and analysed.<br /><br />A far as offshore constructions:<br />&nbsp;Jersey has good trust regulations regarding privacy which restricts them to give out information.<br />Do your own research on this though. If you need total privacy I can provide legit notarised scans of docs you can use to setup an offshore trust, not cheap though.
