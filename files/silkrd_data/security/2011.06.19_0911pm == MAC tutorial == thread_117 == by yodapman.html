				@yodapman-I am using it with 4.0 on a Mac.&nbsp; Works very slickly, once you understand the basics.&nbsp; For your purposes, GPG and PGP are the same thing.&nbsp; In the old days I always called it PGP (for Pretty Good Privacy) but here everyone calls it GPG (GnuPG).<br /><br />There is an excellent tutorial at:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://g7pz322wcy6jnn4r.onion/opensource/II/gpgmacfield.html&nbsp; &nbsp;Written by a fellow SR user, godisbread.<br /><br />Download the referenced free MACGPG2 program and go through the first two parts of the tutorial: Installation and Key Generation<br /><br />Ignore the third part: Message Encryption Operations-you cannot use the &quot;GPG Drop Thing&quot; to encrypt/decrypt messages.&nbsp; It&#039;s because you have no way to associate the message with a specific persons key...that has to be done with a mail program...AFAIK<br />This will make sense when you get to this point.<br /><br />To encrypt a message, you will need to open your mail program on Mac, type your message in a &quot;new message&quot; THEN (very important) select the whole message, then go MAIL--&gt;SERVICES--&gt;OPEN PGP:ENCRYPT&nbsp; &nbsp;If you only type the message but don&#039;t select/highlight all of it, the necessary function selections will not show up under the SERVICES menu and you will be completely flummoxed and think you are a retarded asswipe...just like I did!!!&nbsp; I nearly went crazy looking for a function I *fucking knew* must exist there, but didn&#039;t show up at all.<br /><br />You also have to use your mail program for *importing other people&#039;s keys* as well.&nbsp; Just clipboard their key from the source, put it in a new message (you don&#039;t have to put a recipient or anything else, just use a blank message, like in the above example) then go to: MAIL--&gt;SERVICES--&gt;OPEN PGP:IMPORT KEY&nbsp; and it will go directly to your keychain, which will be a program in your applications file and you can open it and see whose keys you have already and whose you don&#039;t.&nbsp; When you finish Installation, it will be empty; when you finish Key Encryption, it will have just your own key in it.<br /><br />BIG WARNING: use a totally fake name and email when it asks for your name and email during Key Generation.&nbsp; That name and email goes out as an identifier to everyone who imports your public key...<br /><br />It&#039;s nice of you to offer to pay for help, but aren&#039;t we at least partially here to help each other out? :)&nbsp; I just hope this saves you the whole weekend of frustration I suffered a few weeks ago because I had used PGP in the past but had sent the emails &quot;non-anonymously&quot; thru my previous Win-based computer and email program, which did all of this automatically via plug-ins.&nbsp; <br /><br />GOOD LUCK!!!
