				Being a noob, I have been browsing through all of the material reading up on how to successfully use SR. Some guides/posts recommend using USB with Linux or operating system installed on it to access SR. Some don&#039;t mention it at all.Is it Ok to use your personal computer to make purchases since your already using Tor, PGP, etc.? What do the majority of members do?

				I am also a noob, so I could be wrong, but the reasoning behind the USB thing, it seems to me, is that it&#039;s easier and more cost effective to get rid of than your computer&#039;s HDD. It&#039;s probably not necessary, but why take risks that you don&#039;t have to take? Would you rather wipe your HDD, or get rid of a $5 USB stick?<br /><br />If you&#039;re doing anything illegal in your country, particularly buying or selling drugs in large quantities, it&#039;s probably pretty stupid not to take the extra precaution.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are other factors that come into this, but a more experienced user will have to fill you in.

				When you run your computer from a hard drive, various bits of information are stored on that drive, that can be recovered by LE.<br />When your run a bootable USB, all this information is stored in RAM, instead of the hard drive, which is completely erased when it is powered off.<br />If your not going to use a bootable USB, at least use Truecrypt to encrypt your system partition with a long password

				The ChineseGeneral advises all his brothers and sisters not to use any storage media as I possess all the keys.&nbsp; <br /><br />Open your Chinese computer, unplug, ground yourself, remove the hard drive ground.&nbsp; Use usb DVD drive to take with you, steal someones computer and remove the hard drive for extra anon style points.&nbsp; <br /><br />
