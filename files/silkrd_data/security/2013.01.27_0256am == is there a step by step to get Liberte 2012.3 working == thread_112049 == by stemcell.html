				Alrighty, well I don&#039;t believe that there is a real step by step guide, so I&#039;ll just start with some intro advice. <br />Liberte&#039; linux is it&#039;s own OS.. so you can&#039;t just run it with windows or what have you like you would with say the tor browser bundle, or itunes. Rather, you have to give it it&#039;s own environment so that it can install and run itself as a entirely new &quot;computer&quot; hosting on your hardware. There are a few ways to do this, most notably with either a Live usb (usb that is a bootable device) or a virtual machine.. I reccommend the virtual machine as it is easy to stumble through putting together.. however the usb install can plug into any machine and boot up, which can be cool.<br /><br />Firstly let&#039;s explain virtualization.. go and download/install a program called virtualbox. this program once installed will allow you to build virtual machines.... or computers within computers :o&nbsp; &nbsp;A virtualization program essentially divides up your computers hardware to allow for multiple operating systems to run in their own sand-boxed environment side by side.. <br /><br />Go to Liberte&#039; linux homepage and you will see a few download options, choose the &quot;open virtualization format&quot; or otherwise known as the ova format. Allow it to download from sourceforge.<br /><br />Open virtualbox and go to &quot;file&quot; then &quot;import appliance&quot;.. this will open an import wizard.<br /><br />Select &quot;choose&quot; and find the liberte ova file you just downloaded.. once you&#039;ve done this just hit next.<br /><br />A list of details and config settings will open, just go ahead and leave all of the defaults for now.. next button<br /><br />With any luck it will now assemble your new machine and show it in virtualbox&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Awesome, select your new machine and hit &quot;start&quot;. you should see a window open and beautiful text start filling up your screen as the first time boot gets underway.. After a moment the text will ask you to enter a password.. this password is what encrypts the persistence and allows you to login so make sure this is one of those &quot;important&quot; passwords that you won&#039;t forget.<br /><br />Aaaand there you should be! <br /><br />If you have any more questions let me know.. maybe later I&#039;ll write up a Live usb guide <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I personally have used both tails and liberte&#039; quite a bit, and I would have to give the reccommendation to liberte&#039;.. To the best of my knowledge kleopatra is nothing more than a cert. manager for running gpg in windows.. which is cool, but it&#039;s not a standalone secure OS like tails or liberte&#039;..

				No problem man, yeah there is definitely a world full of information to learn.. so just stay methodical and don&#039;t get all fragmented and stressed out.. if you have any problems feel free to message me as I log in most days. I know my shit pretty well and am glad to help those in need of assitance. first things first get liberte running.. then worry about everything else
