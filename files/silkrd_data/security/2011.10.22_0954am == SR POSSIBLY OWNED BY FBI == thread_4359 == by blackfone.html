				I&#039;m sure this is not a new theory to any of you, but http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/jilsi-pleads-guilty/ has an article about an FBI OWNED darkmarket. This site was specifically for carding, but they had escrow and disputes to keep bad sellers out and the whole 9yards. When E-gold was subpoenaed to give over account information, ip addresses, and other info the guy was busted.<br /><br />Just imagine for a moment. FBI owns SR, is able responsible for the tumbling service, fbi uses info to find LR or Dwolla account, fbi pops dealers into informants, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Guys watch out, I don&#039;t want to see anyone in trouble. Stay safe.

				SR is crawling with individuals ready to jump to premature and ill-informed conclusions. &quot;Sr owned by FBI&quot;, &quot;SomeDude is a scammer because he didn&#039;t answer my PM&quot;, etc etc.. don&#039;t be one of them.<br /><br />Spend a *day* reading the forums before making your next post. Dwolla, Liberty Reserve, E-Gold are *not* here.<br /><br />People always assume that a ste may be bugged and act accordingly -- pgp, btc. If you read around you will know this.. If you read around, you just *may* be tempted to retract your statement some day.<br /><br />[edit] I see you&#039;ve registered long ago, so not a newb by that standard... and I see what you mean about tracing back to dwolla from a tumbling service.. its all plausible... its just that the timing sux.. SR just spent ages and sleepless nights getting the site back up. Its time for some appreciation etc etc....<br /><br />We&#039;re all looking aout for each other, and we&#039;re all staying safe...... join in with that.. just a little more subtlety.

				Look: anything is possible, and if you are prone to paranoia--and many of us are, particularly the tweekers--you&#039;ll start seeing cops under every bush.&nbsp; Just like on the streets, where every car looks like a plainclothes...if cops wanted to set up here, and nail a bunch of low level addicts and users, they could, but they know that&#039;s chickenshit, and nobody&#039;s going to say &quot;yay!&quot; they knocked out SR.&nbsp; And lawyers will be drooling to take this case, as it&#039;s international, everybody is from everywhere...&nbsp; There&#039;s other sites, they pop all the time: Black Market, Open Vendor Database, others I won&#039;t mention...<br /><br />Again, &#039;could be&#039;, and I&#039;m on another site, opiophile, and the reason most of them don&#039;t come here, is because of just this kind of thinking...but it&#039;s also the reason most people avoid misbehaving in any area: don&#039;t wanna get caught.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do the crime etc, my motto.&nbsp; All dealers could be cops, just as all buyers could be snitches.&nbsp; Depends on how you want to operate, how you want to look at things...

				I don&#039;t think so as the FBI would not gain anything out of owning SR. Darkmarket was the days before TOR and the carders were causing billions in financial damage. You are getting an 8th of pot in the mail. Not quite as serious, but we have yet to see any real computer saavy attacks by the DEA yet. Darkmarket was obvious people were calling it a honeypot for like a year before the raids and the admins were suggesting that people use highly tracable VPNs... None of that is happening here. FBI wouldn&#039;t put a forum on a tor node it defeats the purpose. They would put it on clearnet and block TOR like they did with DZF end of story.

				blackfone, you probably arrived here recently. Most sellers and clients didn&#039;t hear about the place from media or hidden wiki, they heard about it from a friend.
