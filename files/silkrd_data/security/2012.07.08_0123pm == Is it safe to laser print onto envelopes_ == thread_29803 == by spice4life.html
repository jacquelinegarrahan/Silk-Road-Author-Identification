				I ask this because they are somehow able to track the printers that are used to counterfeit money, so can this method be used to identify the printer that prints text onto envelopes?

				Most, if not all, laser printers leave a unique &quot;finger print&quot;.<br /><br />

				usually on the edge&#039;s of paper.. so I&#039;d think laser for envelopes wouldn&#039;t leave much of a finger print..

				I&#039;ve seen the recommendation to pay for your laser printer with cash- maybe this is why.

				Through more digging, it appears that monochrome laser printers do not leave a fingerprint. Only the color printers.

				If I were you I&#039;d just buy a label printer.. yeah it costs more than a normal printer but its so much easier. Plus its something like 20$ for 100 ft roll of label tape that gets cut to the size by the label printer. I was able to send out over 230 orders with the sample 24 ft roll that came with the printer so a refill 100 ft roll would last for like 1000+ orders
