				Guy who looked way too awkward in a usps uniform knocked on my door today and asked me to sign for a package mailed priority. Alarms immensity went off because <br />1. I have never used my living address for illegal goods. Only boxes with business address. Why was this package mailed to a virtual business office post box being delivered to my home?<br />2. Priority with signature? Yeah right.<br />3. After refusing and saying for him to return to sender, he started to comment about how it was &quot;Strange&quot;&nbsp; for someone to refuse a package. Started asking me if something was inside I was nervous about. I kept denying everything I could, until he said, &quot;well I will have to forward this package to the nearest united states postal inspectors office who could open the package without a court order, and that if anything was found inside I &quot;shouldn&#039;t expect a knock, but your door jam being smashed in.&quot; I asked him if he was a cop and he walked away saying &quot;No, but I have seen this happen many times.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t need advice about what to do, I took care of all that already. No drugs in the house really anyways. Only operate on a USB tails which wash smashed and flushed. Stay safe

				When they resort to open threats with words you really know they have nothing.<br /><br />The fact is that this sort of intimidation is the last resort they have when real working approaches fail, but sadly so many people yet fall for it and become scary, when they should immediately understand instead that the fact they are trying to scare you out with words and psychological tricks it is just because you have the knife from the handle in the issue.<br /><br />I really hope more people would start understanding this because it is really sad when LE have nothing and people just destroy their lives with their own hands.<br /><br />P.S: When LE say the typical excuse &quot;we are just doing our work&quot; you understand by these things how much they lie about it and how much they are, instead, doing it willingly because they like it. If you really were just doing &quot;your work&quot; - even not agreeing on what you are asked to do, but you are paid to do it so you must&nbsp; - you would never resort to psychological torture (because that&#039;s what it is in the end) to obtain something you cannot obtain with the laws you supposedly follow just because &quot;it is your work&quot;, isn&#039;t it?

				It doesn&#039;t matter if the story is true or not. I personally replied as if it was true just because anyway there was something to learn for newbies in the story (false or not). Too many people still talk to LE when they make threats not understanding that if they do is just because they have nothing. If they have something against you they will simply employ it immediately, they will not waste time advising you of what&#039;s going to happen.

Refusal to accept a package does not constitute grounds to open it. Also, LE can&#039;t enter your home without a warrant or without your consent. A package delivered to you like this one was would not be enough to secure a search warrant. You have to be directly tied to the shipment somehow, either through a request you made for the package to be delivered to you, or your payment for it. Otherwise anyone could simply send you a package full of contraband to have you arrested by entrapment. Which is totally illegal.<br /><br />Remember, kids: you&#039;re not allowed to lie to LE, but they&#039;re allowed to lie to you.&nbsp; ;)

				@imghost9 - If you truly do not know what the package contains, or its origin; then tell the post service simply that.&nbsp; You are doing nothing illegal by refusing a package that you did not intend to receive.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably your best option considering that you obviously buy from SR, if the LE is on to you this would be a fairly easy way to try and set you up.<br /><br />Just my opinion, but as always use your best judgement.<br /><br />Wish you the best

				One time after a night on the town I was waken up by a call from a delivery service. I was told that the delivery man had a 25 kg package for me and wondered where he cold meet up with me to deliver this package. I rarely buy stuff on the internet and elsewhere so I had no idea what this 25 kg package might be, so I agreed to meet the guy and pick up the delivery. When I met him I had to sign for the package and it was then I understood what was going on. The name on the signature sheet wasn&#039;t mine, but my brothers. He had bought a 25 kg bag of fertilizer to make explosives. <br />The reason why I was called was because the delivery guy hadn&#039;t been able to get hold of my brother and since me and my brother have same last names and at that time lived at the same address he just put it on me.

(plain clothes officers arrest you. for possession)<br />Controlled deliveries are very rare around my neck of the woods.

Why was this package mailed to a virtual business office post box being delivered to my home?<br />2. Priority with signature? Yeah right.<br />3. After refusing and saying for him to return to sender, he started to comment about how it was &quot;Strange&quot;&nbsp; for someone to refuse a package. Started asking me if something was inside I was nervous about. I kept denying everything I could, until he said, &quot;well I will have to forward this package to the nearest united states postal inspectors office who could open the package without a court order, and that if anything was found inside I &quot;shouldn&#039;t expect a knock, but your door jam being smashed in.&quot; I asked him if he was a cop and he walked away saying &quot;No, but I have seen this happen many times.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t need advice about what to do, I took care of all that already.
