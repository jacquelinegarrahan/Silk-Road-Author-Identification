				I made a cash payment at cvs today using bitinstant. I used my real name and DOB on the order slip and made the payment over the phone just as i had done several times before, but this time when i went to the cashier, she started asking a lot of questions. What is this for? Is this a bill? Zip Zap, ? that sounds like fun! (she actually said the part 2 or 3 times!) I&#039;m not sure if she was just trying to make conversation or what but i gave short responses for each question and told her i was paying a bill. Before i gave her cash she also asked for my ID which i gave her (first time i&#039;ve been asked for it making payments at CVS,note i sent my bitcoins directly from bitinstant to my desktop client, which is what i do each time before sending them through instawallet&gt;bitcoinfog&gt;SR). We all know that buying bitcoins is perfectly legal, basically my question would be: If I send my coins through say instawallet&gt;bitcoinfog&gt;instawallet&gt;bitcoinfog&gt;SR would I be secure even though i did use a real name and showed id at the store. I know a lot of people are using fake names but if i had used one in this instance i would have had to leave or try and convince her to let me pay without showing my id, both of which would arouse suspicion IMHO.

				I think you will be just fine.<br /><br />My question is, when you did your transaction..&nbsp; Did you actually receive your coins?<br /><br />I made a very similar transaction today, from CVS and all that..&nbsp; And still no fuckin coins.&nbsp; I have e-mailed support, and haven&#039;t gotten any answer as of yet.<br /><br /><br />Fuck these guys, I&#039;m done using bitinstant.

				I&#039;ve had similar happen before, I think it is mostly the cashier doesn&#039;t recognize the company, I hear a rumor they will ask for ID for transactions over $100 to make sure they are sending it to the right person.

				From what (very) little I know about the guys who started/run BitInstant, I really like them actually.&nbsp; Well, I guess I only mean Erik Voorhees (PR department) and the chief tech officer... Gareth Nelson I think?&nbsp; He&#039;s got a cute little geeky personal website.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll get it sorted, and they&#039;ve always been very quick with customer service.<br /><br />If this is happening frequently today/yesterday/whatever, then it&#039;s going to take them awhile to get through all the incoming complaints about it.&nbsp; They&#039;re a reputable place, they&#039;ll get to you I&#039;m sure :)<br /><br />FYI, I&#039;ve done the Moneygram/BitInstant thing several times for several hundred each time, and they have always asked me for ID.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done anything less than $100 though.

I need to find a viable alternative away from bitinstant. I read on the forums all the time about people wanting to use a fake name when getting coins, but from my understanding bitcoinfog makes the coins untraceable to that moment when you bought them so i just figured i would get a second opinion :)

				Use Wal-Mart if possible. I&#039;ve done half a dozen Bitinstant transactions at five different locations and have never been asked to confirm anything or show ID. I think they go by your phone number as your identifier in the system.
