				depends if you have a criminal record or not. if you don&#039;t have a record then LE don&#039;t have your prints so not too much of a cause for concern. until you get pinched for something of course.<br /><br />couple of reasons to be worried:<br /><br />1. you&#039;ve sold to LE. <br />2. your packages get seized.<br /><br />if you have a record and either of the above happens you are in trouble. if all of your packages got through ok with no problems just keep an eye for any reviews from the buyers - if they sound dodgy you might still be in trouble.<br /><br />basically if you have a record and either point above is true you&#039;re fucked mate, sorry.

				ah - dunno mate, i&#039;m the other side of the pond. if it&#039;s a small amount thats seized they&#039;ll probably just dispose of it and won&#039;t give it a second though, but if LE bought it from here and they can access the DMV&#039;s records, you will get a knock at the door

				np, i like an honest answer. I looked it up, and apparently LE can use whatever database they want for a criminal investigation. So the DMV database is fair-game.&nbsp; Oh well, i guess i just gotta cross my fingers and hope I haven&#039;t sold to LE. I&#039;m pretty sure I have sold to LE though :(&nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Treat every package like LE bought it.<br /><br />2-3 gloves.. remove after every step.<br />rinse and repeat.<br /><br />make sure no hair gets on anything, keep gloves on.<br />you should be fine.<br /><br />vinyl gloves, no powder preferably. latex can leave prints when something gets on the outside... not to mention they are thin.<br />vinyl is where it&#039;s it. no powder, obviously.

				The inside is the key. There are plenty po workers that don&#039;t wear gloves. <br /><br />If nothing on the inside, how can they possibly prove you packed it? They can&#039;t. You just ran an errand for your sweet old (SR VENDING) grandmother! <br /><br />Not that that&#039;s the end of it by any means... <br /><br />
