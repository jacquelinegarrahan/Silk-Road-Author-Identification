				I have tried to understand exactly why/how trading with BTC gives you a high level of privacy but was wondering if someone could clairfy the level of security involved by trading in the following way.<br /><br />Bank transfer from my personal account to a third party in my country who deposits the money into MT Gox. <br /><br />Mt Gox then credits me with USD.&nbsp; I buy BTC and send it to my wallet.<br /><br />My wallet to SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR purchase made.<br /><br />If I decide to go this way and purchase some products from SR. How hard would it be for LE to track these purchases to my original bank transfer?<br /><br />I understand that this would not be the most secure way, but realistically how risky is this?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I think the LE can go as far as tracking the purchase of bitcoins in Mt Gox and the transfer to your wallet (if unencrypted) if they get hold of your computer. After that, it is hard to prove you transferred it to SR.

				If they would have read the info on the &quot;How to&quot; on SR they wouldn&#039;t have done that. I had no idea what a btc was nor a digital wallet really, for that matter until I got here and did a lot of reading. I also think it would be a little &quot;safer&quot; to use tor and then use the online mybitcoin wallet. That way, nothing touches your computer, or have 2 mybitcoin&#039;s one on the computer and one on their site. If you are using a hidden service like TOR, I think LE would have a tough time following the trail to you/us.

				Supposedly they are watching us anyway, but they are pretty much bound to their &quot;laws.&quot; As for privacy on my part, using Tor should be sufficient enough, but originally I am already on a VPN using a dynamic ip, which links with a offshore server (proxy) and from there I am on Tor. So it&#039;s pretty much a proxy within another one on a VPN. Also running a couple other programs anyway, (e.i Peerblock) so in the end there may be a -10% chance I might be caught.
