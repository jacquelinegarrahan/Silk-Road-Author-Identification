				1) is it safe to run tor on a computer that is also running teamviewer (back ground)?<br /><br />2) could a person use teamviewer through tor to make them anonymously in control of another machine?<br /><br />3) could teamviewer be used to.. nevermind of course a person remote controlling a machine could open a tor browser and surf using it. <br /><br />

Someone could then compromise your machine through teamviewer using your real public IP.<br /><br />2) Doubtful it would work through Tor. More than likely it would timeout. I&#039;d be more worried about having a program that allows connection to my machine via real public IP with only a password protecting it.<br /><br />3) Yes, they would have the same access as the user currently logged in.<br /><br />If you are trying to find a remote solution to access your machine I&#039;d recommend setting up SSH as a Tor Hidden Service. This way you could connect to your machine via it&#039;s .onion address instead of your public IP.

				So with regard to #1, I&#039;ll take your word on it. better safe than sorry. But wouldn&#039;t they have to know my actual IP? and using teamviewer they would have to know the password? at any rate doesn&#039;t matter. <br /><br />for #2 I was hopeful but I had doubts.<br /><br />and yeah I suppose it&#039;s a cheap solution to running tor remotely. still a vpn would work, and I have more learning now about SSH.

Yes, but if you&#039;re generating non Tor traffic it&#039;s publicly accessible.<br /><br />Yea, no GUI will work across Tor that I&#039;ve found. Even SSH has a delay and it&#039;s only a terminal. <br /><br />Well with a VPN you&#039;re still connecting to IP address. This is why I like SSH over Tor, as it is still location hidden.
