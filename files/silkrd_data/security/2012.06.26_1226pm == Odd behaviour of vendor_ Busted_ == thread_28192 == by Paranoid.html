				Ok I have created this account to discuss something weird that I feel uneasy about. I have been planning to make an order from a certain vendor ( who I won&#039;t name for reasons that will be clear) as such I have been watching his listings while transitting BTC the last few days. Window shopping basically. His vendor page said yesterday just got new stock in and various items available.<br />I go to order this morning and all listings have vanished. When I message him using PGP key on his page he messages back &quot; try this one mate&quot; with a new key. I try this one but am careful just to ask him what&#039;s up nothing else as already I think it&#039;s a bit weird. He sends me back a message I can&#039;t decrypt. I ask him to go plaintext and he says &quot; all ok just selling last of my stock if you are interested&quot;<br />This seems unusual. I am concerned he has been busted and now LE are fishing for evidence from customers.<br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m totally being para but I&#039;m steering clear.

				I&#039;m not concerned for myself but if I name the vendor in question is this thread not going to incriminate him further? I have been careful in my correspondence with the &quot;vendor&quot;

				Naming the vendor can only help the community in the case that your worries are legitimate. He sounds confused more than anything else...<br /><br />Personally, and i think this applies to most people here, if I have even the slightest sense of &quot;sketch&quot; about a vendor I just look elsewhere... It is as simple as pressing the &quot;back&quot; button.<br /><br />No matter what just follow the common sense personal security measures and you&#039;re not gonna get in any trouble.

				No but I&#039;m not sure He would anyway. He didn&#039;t used to use PGP and the problems may just be due to unfamiliarity. The message he sent me said CAST encryption and my passphrase wouldn&#039;t decrypt it.<br />I have spoken to him a bit more; he says he is too busy and is taking a break from listing. It just seems odd that his vendor page was updated saying new batch etc yesterday and now first he says he&#039;s selling last of stock and then says too busy. I want his product but he is being cagey about what he has. I don&#039;t want to come out and say &quot; how much for x&quot; It&#039;s a pain cos if it&#039;s legit I&#039;m doing without my stuff but it just smells too funny
