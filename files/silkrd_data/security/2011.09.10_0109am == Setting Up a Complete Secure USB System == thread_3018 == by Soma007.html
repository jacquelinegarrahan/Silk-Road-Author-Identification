				Hey Guys,<br /><br />I have been looking for a complete guide to setting up a secure OS, Truecrypt, PGP email on a USB stick.&nbsp; I would like to be able to store files, bitcoin wallet, PGP keys and messages on the encrypted USB.<br /><br />Can anyone give me a good easy to follow guide?&nbsp; I am sure this would be useful to all members and help us all with security.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Soma

				TrueCrypt is quite user friendly. We have successfully encrypted all our computers and a USB secure drive. A guide may be useful, this could be a niche in the market :) if anyone can be bothered writing it.

				Let me guide you for a moment,&nbsp; in a logical / strategic sense (no specific steps).<br /><br />For Windows XP/Vista/7 all you do is:<br /><br />(i)Disable your PC HDD&#039;s in bios (Important to protect the MBR)<br />(ii)Plug in USB<br />(iii)Put Windows CD in tray<br />(iv)Switch on PC and install Windows to the USB<br />(v)Re-enable your normal HDD in bios<br />(vi)Boot to your USB Windows and install truecrypt<br />(vii)Follow the truecrypt instructions.<br /><br />thats 1 of *many* ways to achieve the goal. I took a few extra steps to preserve the integrity of you existing HDD. Expert users dont need to do those steps (bios etc).<br /><br />If Linux:<br /><br />Very easy, just install Ubuntu or Debian. They have their own full encrytion options when you install. AES 256, same as truecrypt. The linux option is much easier.<br /><br />*Also* you can install Linux on a USB from within Windows using a program called &#039;Unetbootin&#039;.<br /><br />

				Liberte Linux uses OTFE, but is too lightweight for TrueCrypt.<br /><br />But, it&#039;s a fortress. The security measures used in it will blow your effing mind! It&#039;s worth learning how to use.

				Liberte looks awesome. If you can install it encrypted that will be the way to go.<br /><br />OP: If Linux is your thing, get Ubuntu. Boot computer with Ubuntu in drive and install to the USB. Use the LVM &amp; encrypted option (Option 4) when you get to it on the partitioning options. This will install the OS on your USB and Encrypt it fully. None of your other HDDs or OSs will be affected. The encryption is the same level as truecrypt.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see any guides for this method, I think maybe because already its too easy.

				I have a 4GB USB flash drive.<br /><br />I installed tails to it using unetbootin.<br />I then used Gparted to shrink the tails partition on the drive leaving 3GB+ of un allocated space.<br />I then created a 50mb partition ext3 and put truecrypt portable on it.<br />I boot to tails, mount the 50mb partition and use truecrypt to create an encrypted partition.<br />The encrypted partition has keepass database, gpg stuff, documents etc.<br /><br />Really simple.

				Liberte doesn&#039;t &#039;install&#039; per-se. You jsut copy it and dump a boot laoder. You can use a USB drive as small as 512MB, but your persistent, encrypted storage would be tiny.<br /><br />Liberte is more like a live iso, but with persistent storage and settings. It&#039;s stupdily easy to set up and run. If you can copy, paste, and read 3 sentences, you&#039;ve got it covered.

				I had no luck with TAILS either. I went with Liberte because it&#039;s based on Gentoo and you can build-rebuild if you need to. Fully customisable build system. Not for the inexperienced, tho... The &#039;stock&#039; verson is very lightweight and does not support the Bitcoin Wallet or TrueCrypt. It does use OTFE for encryption,and if you have an online wallet, this issue doesn&#039;t apply. If you&#039;re feeling really special you can include the dependencies for TrueCrypt and the Bitcoin Wallet in a custom build.

				I use bestcrypt software.<br />Its good and simple. There are many other security feature enabled; dod wipe, encrypt/wipe win swap and temp files/schedule to wipe tmp files from all software installed, Pgp keys etc etc<br /><br />edit<br /><br />It create container where you place your files. Its mounted like any drive and can be copy to usb, cd, dvd or any media. That drive is a file actually big like your container.<br />You mount this file/container and that is! All exchange between bestcrypt engine and OS e.g. temp,swap files are encrypted in real time. You can run programs from it because its behave like drive. New container can be encrypted with many cyphers (blowfish,idea,triple des,gost,cast,rijandel,serpent) Have a crypt maneger and key manger where you can import/update new cypher or key.
