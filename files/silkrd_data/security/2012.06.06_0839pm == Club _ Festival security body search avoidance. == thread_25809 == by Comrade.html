				I&#039;m wondering how hard they search..<br /><br />I heard for girls, hair and breastholders are the spots but what for men?<br /><br />Do they check shoes often?<br />Do they check if the batteries are in your phone/camera..?<br /><br />Also I heard that if you wrap it up in 2 condoms dogs wont smell through is that correct?<br />Is there a proper way to avoid dogs? (I might have to pass some dogs, they are only there the first hour as they cant work much longer but the people i&#039;m with want to &quot;get in asap&quot; so..)<br /><br />Its been a while since i&#039;ve been bodysearched so some todo&#039;s might be helpfull but i would not want to see good methods go public and obsolete so i prefer to hear from you :<br /><br />What they do check? = &quot;The Don&#039;t do&#039;s&quot;<br />How to handle eventual dogs (its not that they can change anything to make this not work)<br />Tips for what they dont search for good reasons. (Well im not shoving things up my ass but perhaps might wrap something around my dick instead, as i dont think they grab people in the cross.)<br /><br />Pls enlight me :)

				They don&#039;t usually check inside shoes.<br /><br />They sometimes won&#039;t let you take phones or cameras in, but when they do they never check for a battery.<br /><br />Dogs can smell everything, it&#039;s pot luck with them. Vacuum sealing is the best way.<br /><br />A good method for larger items is to vacuum seal them, then &#039;balls&#039; them, which means to sellotape or use a rubber band to attach them to the back of your manly ball sack. Done this many a time.

				I don&#039;t have much festival experience, only the same one in my area year after year, but how could they possibly utilize dogs other than as a scare tactic? I mean the majority of people coming that don&#039;t have drugs on them are already baked and probably smoked on the way over, wouldn&#039;t that many people reaking of weed make a drug sniffing dog go ballistic?

I highly doubt passive drugs dogs like the ones they use at festivals are trained to find MDMA or Ket etc.

				what you need to understand is that if the festival is HUGE then they Cant CHECK EVERYONE. <br />they care more about guns n knives then drugs <br /><br />if its for personal use then just shoe it or ball it, if your going to vend well that changes the game. <br />thats when id suggest a vaccum seal as id rather not get caught with a few g packs or what not<br /><br />overall being the 1st person in ISNT the best idea, security is fresh n not yet bored. <br />most of the times they do a simple pat down, like i said guns n weapons are the biggest worry. <br /><br />

				These dogs are only there at the opening. When the masses are there. The dogs can&#039;t handle this for a longer period. We used to come later but this time im the only user and my companions want to be there on the first row&nbsp; :-\ When you come late 1hr you see that there is only few security left and they are spending more time chatting with eachother then realy checking you. <br /><br />Do you realy need an expensive device for vacuum packaging? (These devices and &quot;bags&quot; seem so big just to pop some mdma in)<br />I was thinking of packing them in a condom, tie it, cut the rest, tie up again in another condom and then just patching them behind my balls (you know this big patches for when like you&#039;ve hurt a rather big surface of your skin.)<br /><br />I could pop upfront but i prefer to save up for the top acts and to delay the comedown ofcource.<br /><br />It is for personal use but getting caught might get me divorced aswel (I quited this ages ago and now I just do this 3-4 times a year only but still its a dealy sin.)<br />It&#039;s full with cops and they have containers there. They arrested 2% of the party people. Used drugs dogs at opening of the gates. Considering that probably no more then 25% carries something 2% is a descent amount. (Lot of people take up front, just dont do drugs, and those who do and go in group have it carried by a girl so i estimate 25% as a rather high number i think in reality its even lower. So I think they bust around 10% of all drug carriers.)

				I&#039;ve only had experience with Reading (back when it was still good) and Lowlands.<br />For Reading I just had my weed all wrapped up in sock in my rucksack, and always got through OK. And Lowlands was in Holland, so hiding weed wasn&#039;t really a problem... Walked through security smoking a joint one year!&nbsp; 8)

				Personally, I just stuff whatever I have inside of my pants, just below my belt, right above my crotch. Or, if it is small enough it goes in the little watch pocket above the main front pocket of my jeans like someone has said.<br /><br />If you are super paranoid you can wrap your stash up in saran wrap/cellophane and drop it in your bottle of sunblock. With skin cancer rates these days it would be really ballzy for security to fuck with someones sunblock, whether dogs hit on it or not. Just make sure you have tested it for water tightness. Carry a paperclip or something to help you snag it out of there while you are in a porta potty. Have a great time and spread the love!

				Thx for the responses.<br /><br />I have no clue what the tuck method is.<br />Crotch-ing is what i planned to do. Just need to get it dog proof somehow.<br /><br />The suncream is a good idea only problem : I need to hide all aspects of the smuggle and even usage from the people i&#039;m with also.<br />Can imagine the looks when i take the suncream to the toilet.<br /><br />The small clock sack in your jeans? Your kidding me that pocket search is standard procedure! I could fill my trunck with security fingers that searched that pocket. Feeling around your belt is also standard.

				Vacuum seal.. In two more baggies.. Sellotape to your balls.<br /><br />OR.. buy some boxers with a hidden pocket in them, and do the vacuum seal etc but stash em in there<br /><br />You can buy them online on the cheap, google &quot;stashitwear&quot;.<br /><br />You&#039;re not going to get strip searched if a dog goes off at you. They&#039;ll just pat you down and check your bag/shoes/pockets etc.
