When they took down Freedom Hostings servers in August, it took tormail down. They were hosted by Freedom Hosting&#039;s servers. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re ever coming back. <br /><br />That&#039;s why I have this user name. I couldn&#039;t retrieve my password for my old forum account because I used tormail to register.<br /><br />See here:<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Mail

I&#039;d suggest hushmail or something like that (I know they can give up your info, but at least they aren&#039;t US based).<br /><br />Hushmail through TOR using PGP encryption is the only thing I can think of. There are no other .onion email providers that I know of. At least if you use PGP, you can protect the text of your emails.

One DEA spokesman boasted that they had collected in excess of 100,000 emails by this method. <br /><br />If Hushmail even suspects that their service is being anything illegal, they can (and will) turn everything they have over to the authorities. Some sources have told me that Subject lines are regularly scanned for keywords that could potentially indicate illegal activity.

				Lol hushmail<br /><br />They feed you a MITM login to steal your password in the clear. Then they hand your entire inbox to the feds. They also lie about &quot;deleting&quot; emails, instead they are archived forever. A steroid retailer and Adam from Farmer&#039;s Market found this out the hard way.<br />

I vaguely remember reading that there&#039;s a clause in the TOS about illegal activity, but if you use PGP, they shouldn&#039;t detect any illegal activity. Make sure your PGP key uses a minimum of 2048 bit encryption (I use 4096, but 2048 will do).<br /><br />Being based in Canada is better than being based in the US as far as data storage goes (I&#039;m talking in terms of offering more protection from NSA snooping. Yahoo, Gmail, and Hotmail all require a valid phone number now to sign up.<br /><br />I can&#039;t think of any truly private email provider. PGP, Tor, and a fake name is your best bet.

I already know about hushmail&#039;s weaknesses. It&#039;s better than Gmail, yahoo, hotmail, etc. At least you don&#039;t need a verifiable phone number for hushmail.<br /><br />Nobody suggested anything, so I&#039;m assuming the answer is none. My answer was the lesser of several evils.
