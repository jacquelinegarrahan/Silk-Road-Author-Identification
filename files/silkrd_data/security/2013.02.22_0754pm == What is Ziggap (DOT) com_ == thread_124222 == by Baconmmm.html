				You can read on their site --- you choose the method you want to use to buy bitcoins, and fill out the form, and then they give you more info, I assume.

				Hey Scout, i&#039;ve been on their site, set up an account and everything but i am very confused as how to go about the actual purchasing.<br /><br />Has anyone ever used ziggap.com? <br /><br />Do i just go into a Chase Bank and give them 500.00 $ ( FOR EXAMPLE ), and tell them to send it to the person on the ziggap.com checkout page?<br /><br />Please help, i want to put money on my SR account as soon as possible. Thank you all.

				ziggap appears to be a site like bitinstant that allows you to do cash deposits to a bitcoin address. I saw someone mention it on bitcointalk.org&#039;s forums the other day as a viable alternative to bitinstant since bitinstant&#039;s cash deposit option has been down for a few days. I mentioned the site in a post on here yesterday, and someone said that they used it and it worked fine. Unfortunately today I attempted to go on the site and fill out a cash deposit slip, and it seems the site is no longer working. Probably cant handle all the traffic from people migrating from bitinstant

				I haven&#039;t used Ziggap before -- I know they are relatively new though.&nbsp; I would assume that when you signed up for an account you were then able to select the payment method and put in the amount you wanted to buy?&nbsp; If you select Chase Bank on their page, they should then provide you with the account information for the deposit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the checkout page looks like -- did it give you any further instructions or any kind of Chase bank account number?

				I used ziggap 2 days ago and it worked flawlessly.&nbsp; I did a Chase bank cash deposit to BTC address and had my coin in less than 4 hours.&nbsp; Looking at the site now I noticed that chase bank is no longer an option&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I hope it comes back because WU and MG deposits take 2-3 days to confirm.<br /><br />Bitinstant was my favorite but it looks like they are circleing the drain and will be gone soon.&nbsp; Even though the message on their site says functionality will be back up Monday Feb 25th... Yeah right, they have been giving dates like that for almost 2 weeks now.<br /><br />What bank does bitcopia use for cash deposits and anyone who has used them, how long was the turn around time?<br /><br />Peace

You can deposit cash in person or do electronic transfers from another Wells Fargo account.&nbsp; Of course you could quickly and easily learn this by visiting the site for yourself.<br /><br />Anytime I&#039;ve used it the coins were already in my wallet by the time I got home.

				For Wells Fargo anonymous cash deposits, do you need to show photo ID for transfers of over $500? I want to purchase between 500 and 1000 USD from bitcopia on Monday...
