				I tried using instawallet to transfer coins to the bitcoin fog like I&#039;ve done in the past but I got a 504 gateway time out error when I hit send for the coins and when I went back to my wallet all the money was gone and it hasn&#039;t appeared in my bitcoin fog yet. Does anyone know what&#039;s up or have any idea if it went through?

Are you sure about this? What was the wallet associated with, SR, Mtgox, or some other agency? Did you have them try to track what happened?

				Thanks for the replies sorry for the hasty topic, I contacted the owner of the site and he helped me get them back right away at a pretty impressive speed and I got everything sorted out.

				I&#039;m glad you got them back...I think everybody should have to chase down their blocks at least once, just to go down that rabbit hole.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve never had any problems w/instawallet, and have totally gotten rid of storage on my pc....

				get your own wallet to stop this happening again. also makes it a damn sight more difficult to trace your transactions, and negate the need to bounce your coins through a few instawallets before transferring it to the Road.<br /><br />download your own wallet here - http://bitcoin.org/<br /><br />stick your wallet in the same encrypted drive you store Tor in and you&#039;re safe as houses :)
