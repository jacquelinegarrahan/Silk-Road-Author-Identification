				That thread about the feds showing up 9 days ago to their house and doing something to their computer because someone did swatting from his IP has disappeared.&nbsp; The thread is gone and the user hasn&#039;t signed in since he made it.&nbsp; I think his account might be gone too now.&nbsp; It was something like onionsone&nbsp; or something and he had the avatar with Mr Mackey from South Park.&nbsp; I think that is really interesting....<br /><br />Does anyone remember his exact username?&nbsp; The thread is gone and and he fell off the map.

				I was just telling a friend about this today.

				I was wondering why I went back down to Sr Member lol. OP was one of the only other users on here discussing steroids so I followed some of his posts. Now all those threads are gone.<br /><br />Funny thing is, I managed to read through a bunch of his posts and the dude sounds familiar. I hate to say it, but he did give away the state he lives at, a few of his hobbies, and quite possibly his neighborhood, so it&#039;s a good thing his posts were deleted. <br /><br />I know I&#039;ve seen that writing style before.. Let&#039;s just say if it is who I think it is, it&#039;s gotta be one of the weirdest &quot;coincidences&quot; I have ever encountered. Crazy shit. Thankfully I never met this person before IRL nor am I actually connected to him via clearnet, so I&#039;m not worried about myself here.<br /><br />The whole &quot;my IP was used to SWAT someone&quot; thing honestly sounds like BS to me, but I have seen far, far stranger things happen recently. I say either he purchased an anonymous OS boot disk with a rootkit installed, or he pissed off someone he trusts like some gamer clan faggots or something. Odds are the actual perpetrators of the SWATing will get caught, as most of them are immature nerds who can&#039;t keep their mouth shut even if they know how to cover their tracks. The feds do not fuck around when it comes to this sort of thing.

				I remember and had been following this thread. No knowledge of these sorts of things, had never heard of swatting before, but guy seemed genuine. Hopefully this just means he has taken the appropriate security measures to cover himself and he is living free. I hope so.

				Eerie. But how the hell would anyone get away SWATing the WH? And by get away I mean, even make it past the dispatcher? I think everyone in the world knows 1600 Penn Ave.. is not an ordinary Joe Blow&#039;s address. Sounds like bullshit to me.. (that part atleast).

				Yes I remember reading that thread. OP was freaked out. Said something about the feds taking his computer or doing something to it. <br /><br />Well, if I was spooked about the feds coming after me, the first thing I would do is delete my SR forum posts. Did you know that google indexes that shit? I just found out today. Its kinda fucked up, I thought that google didn&#039;t have access to .onion domains. Try it - search for your SR forum username.

				I also remember that thread...<br /><br />I remember him explicitly stating that the CIA was one of the agencies that raided him.&nbsp; He also said that he was not very computer literate and that they told him that someone spoofed a VOIP call from his IP, they hooked up some sort of DOS operated device to his computer, then they left.<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s interesting that he deleted his account &amp; threads, yet imo I don&#039;t think that means what he said was true.<br /><br />- The CIA don&#039;t go around wearing vests that say &quot;CIA&quot;... and if they were plain cloths guys, they aren&#039;t going to tell you &quot;I&#039;m a CIA guy&quot;.&nbsp; No.<br />- The CIA by law, does not conduct domestic spying or collect intelligence on U.S. citizens. (at least, outright)&nbsp; That&#039;s the FBI&#039;s job.<br />E.g. The ricin letter sent to Obama... what agency was raiding suspect houses?&nbsp; The FBI.&nbsp; Though I&#039;d imagine the Secret Service is involved as well, but no mention of the CIA.<br /><br />- If a raid did happen, no way would those agents disclose exactly what they know or what they are looking for to the suspect.&nbsp; (IP spoof)<br />- If a raid did happen, no way would they leave his computer.&nbsp; They would have taken it and any other device related to it.&nbsp; Cops do this for less serious stuff.<br />- If a raid did happen, when those agencies are absolutely tearing apart/destroying the premises, they do not just let you sit there and watch.<br />- If said raid did happen, why would you log onto SR Forums and tell us about it... it&#039;s not like many people were raided for this swatting that he&#039;d be anonymous from big brother.&nbsp; Obviously the feds are here, why would anyone especially after dealing with CIA guys etc., want to announce to them that they are avidly participating with SR etc.&nbsp; They would know who he is.&nbsp; I personally would be in shock or something... then as soon as possible, take the computer out to the back yard and melt it down into a puddle of goop.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I&#039;m no network computer expert, but I&#039;m not even sure you can spoof an IP and make a VOIP call... since any data sent back from the destination (the 911 operator) would be routed back to the real IP.&nbsp; Like a vendor... mail something and use someone else&#039;s address as the return address, if something happened and USPS decided that mail needed to go back to the sender, it would be end up at the return address... not the vendor&#039;s real address.&nbsp; &nbsp;Same thing happens when spoofing an IP I think.&nbsp; You can spoof a username and have two way interaction,&nbsp; but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to just spoof an IP and make a VOIP call. <br /><br />TL;DR<br />I don&#039;t buy the original story... nor do I think his disappearance/deleting of threads makes his story more plausible.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Maybe a step in the right direction, but the G Men don&#039;t fuck around. NSA, Boeing, FBI, CIA, Homeland, Cartels, Mafias, Banks, loan sharks, Root and Brown, Halliburton, Bush Dynasty, corporate agencies ad nauseum...<br /><br />1.

If you think you are in trouble: Contact the best lawyer you can find: find someone that represents Julian Assange. It&#039;s your only chance...<br />5.

				So what&#039;s the lesson to be learned here? <br /><br />Don&#039;t run TOR exit nodes if you have drugs in your house (same place as IP address where you&#039;re running exit node)?
