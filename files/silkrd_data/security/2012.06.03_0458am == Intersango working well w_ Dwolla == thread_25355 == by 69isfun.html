				Hi,<br /><br />With MtGox now requiring additional information for Dwolla transactions I wanted to find a different bitcoin exchange.&nbsp; So far, intersango.com has worked well for selling my btc and dwolla withdrawals are nearly instant.&nbsp; The actual trades take a bit longer to complete but the order book is active and everything seems to be on the up and up.<br /><br />Cheers-<br />a vendor

				OP is full of shit and most likely a shill for Intersango.<br /><br />This website promises that your dwolla transaction will post within the hour... well it&#039;s been 3 hours for me so far and I haven&#039;t heard a thing from them. They don&#039;t answer their tickets, and you can&#039;t email them (it refers you back to tickets in an automated response). There is no forum system, and no real support system.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why the hell I bothered using these guys. This is ridiculous, and from the experiences I&#039;ve seen others have with them it looks like I may get stuck waiting up to ten fucking days.<br /><br />AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.

I should point out the times things went wrong weren&#039;t even their fault. I can get bitcoins from my bank to purchasing something here in 20 mins, and from here to my bank in less than that.<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of sellers on here with vested interests in seeing Intersango and similar services fail, as they make a profit buying or selling bitcoins for you and taking a large commision, so be weary of any feedback. <br /><br />The only independent seller here I would trust with my cash is &quot;vlad1m1r&quot;. He also has what I would consider an advanced knowledge of IT so won&#039;t make noob mistakes which could get you into trouble.

				Sorry if I offended you, sir. I definitely jumped the shark there. <br /><br />It&#039;s a little difficult for me to trust an organization that is so slowwww. Thanks for your clarifying input.

That must be why the director answered my support ticket. They also have some weird ethical issues but I won&#039;t go into that.

				All, i found this update regarding intersango, i cannot vouch for it nor whether it was actually posted by an employee or a nobody so take it however you like i thought i would just add it. the background was a btc trader had been bitching for his account been locked and unable to<br />get the btc off to SR, his mistake was for dropping the name &#039;Silk Road&#039; in conversation and hence contravened their t&#039;s &amp; c&#039;s :-<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m not familiar with your particular situation, I&#039;m sure our support will reply within a reasonable time frame.<br /><br />The title of course is unappreciated and defamatory. We operated as a free service for the greater part of a year. We developed open source exchange software. We wrote the first full reimplementation of bitcoin entirely at our own expense (an 8 month project) and while we aren&#039;t operating at a loss anymore, we are not operating at much of a profit either. Still we maintain the best security and support.<br /><br />While I&#039;m not familiar with your situation - perhaps you could tell us the particulars - I know that accounts will only be restricted if there is very direct proof of illegal activity or a direct admission of intent to do something illegal.&nbsp; Of course we are not an illegal operation; we are not and will not be complicit in any illegal activity.<br /><br />It&#039;s unfortunate that there will of course be some people that attempt to use our services in ways which violate UK law. I&#039;m not saying this is the case with you, however our policy at Intersango is to act only in the event of real proof of a crime or intent to commit a crime. We would never take action without proof and I know my partner who deals with this would not waiver from these principles.<br /><br />We take great steps to ensure that our users&#039; funds are safe, never discriminated against and that accounts are not restricted unless we are certain people have operated outside of our terms and conditions.<br /><br />If you wish to waive your rights under our privacy policy my partner can respond publicly in this thread.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />- i had no idea intersango were so sensitive about all this, suppose its answered my own question on another post..them not wanting to know<br />&nbsp; about Silk Road.<br />- the above post nor incident has notin&#039; to do with me by the way.<br /><br />
