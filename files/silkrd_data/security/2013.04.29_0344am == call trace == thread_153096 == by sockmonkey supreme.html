				So, first thing&#039;s first: I am not a new member. I started a sockmonkey account so as to not associate my usual account with this question in case I do in fact have a security problem.<br /><br />Leading me to the second thing: shitfuckjesus, I&#039;ve never experienced noob purgatory and it sucks. I got tired of answering real questions and hit the spam posts, but does anybody ever consider that it means a lot more &quot;error - you posted 0 seconds ago&quot; for real posts and traffic for the site generally?<br /><br />Third: this is why I posted. It is not a joke. It is certainly not a troll - I didn&#039;t spend the last... ugh, hour? going through noob purgatory just to troll the forums. Here&#039;s what happened to the best of my recollection:<br /><br />I&#039;m on both SR and the forums but the connection is bad. Really bad. I use the vidalia control panel to switch identities. Nothing works. It was also... a little unusual, somehow. Can&#039;t recall if it was the nature of the error screens or the timing or what (I was high at the time and not at my most aware).<br /><br />Well, I hit the instant reboot function on TAILS so I can try a total reconnect. I zone out and vape a little of the green stuff. When I look at my screen again - in 20 seconds or so? I see that it hasn&#039;t completed the reboot cycle and instead has something up that I&#039;ve never seen before. It&#039;s 2 or 3 lines of text, starting with &quot;call trace&quot; (or maybe it was &quot;trace call&quot; - wish I&#039;d been more aware) followed by pairs of characters with a space between each pair, running the rest of the couple/few lines. <br /><br />So the basic look was this (rubbish text for example):<br /><br />call trace P3 7Y NB 1F 3G I9 PL 15 ZY IU 1O A2 (and so on)<br /><br />There may have been more to note but I went from zoned out to panicked in the blink of an eye and shut my computer down (and didn&#039;t get back on). Tried to tell myself that it was nothing, but... it was definitely something.<br /><br />Has anybody else seen this? Explanations?<br /><br />I repeat: this is not a joke. And yeah, I&#039;m aware that if the telecons/ISP were tracking me, spending an hour on here posting to a noob account maybe isn&#039;t wise, but I wanted to put the question out there (and at the same time, not say &quot;Hey LE, you were on to regular user Z in case you didn&#039;t narrow it down).<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />sockmonkey supreme

				Yeah tails doesn&#039;t always shut down clean.<br />That&#039;s just a memory address reference I believe.

				LOL yeah, it&#039;s probably call(ing) a (memory) trace. Nothing to worry about.

				I can imagine why this would cause you to shit yourself if you didn&#039;t know it was talking about tracing a &quot;function call&quot;<br /><br />Hundreds of thousands of functions are called every second on your computer, an important one went wrong while your machine was shutting down and a &quot;trace&quot; was shown for diagnostic purposes.<br /><br />So chill man. Nobody is tracing your calls, or at least if they are they wouldn&#039;t announce it on your computer screen.
