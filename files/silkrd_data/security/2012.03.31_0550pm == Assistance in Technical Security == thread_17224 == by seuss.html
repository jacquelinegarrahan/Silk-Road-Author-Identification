				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: envious</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">also this is off topic but i reiterate the need for you guys to use tor-isolated VMs (with hardware isolation if you can)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />saw this stated in a post. i&#039;ve looked this up and found this tutorial (hxxp://lifehack.org/articles/technology/beginners-guide-run-linux-like-any-other-program-in-windows.html). any tech-savvy person care to express whether he/she thinks this is a good, up-to-date tutorial for a noob, or if there is any tutorial which is better? Also what does it mean to have hardware isolation? is that like putting the VM on a trucrypt encrypted usb flashdrive? i need to encrypt my hdd too, anyone care to redirect me to a tutorial on how to do that? any advice or redirection to good pages or threads would be appreciated.

				well the conclusion on this was that you are better off using OS virtualization or paravirtualization than hardware virtualization, but non virtualized hardware isolation is the clear win

				That post almost meant only using something which is defaulted to force all connections through Tor, so you can&#039;t log in drunk one day in the clear and give away your identity by accident like Sabu did

				Using the Tor browser bundle is fine for here if you&#039;re just a buyer. You can&#039;t connect to SR otherwise so you&#039;re g2g.<br />Now if you&#039;re connecting to IRC and jabber and your external emails it&#039;d be best to create a VM snapshot or use a live CD that forced all connections through Tor so you can&#039;t fuck up, because we&#039;re only human and nobody can maintain perfect comsec discipline everyday.<br /><br />Can always install Virtualbox, VMware or Qemu and load up a Tails or Liberte Linux .iso in it. <br />Better if you just burnt it to CD and rebooted<br />
