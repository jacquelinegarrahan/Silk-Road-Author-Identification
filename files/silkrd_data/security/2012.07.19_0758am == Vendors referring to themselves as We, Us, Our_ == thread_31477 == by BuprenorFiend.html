				I&#039;ve noticed that a lot of vendors like to refer to themselves as if they were a multi-person operation. I realize that a lot of vendors on here probably *are* multi-person operations, but I&#039;m absolutely certain that some of the vendors that I&#039;ve dealt with that do this are just single individuals working by themselves start to finish. Is there a valid security reason behind this practice, or are they just trying to sound more professional?

				We believe it to be the latter. Often it&#039;s helpful to think in the 3rd person to compose a business plan or to think more logically about stuff.<br /><br />But pine thinks pine just does it to annoy everybody :)<br /><br />Pine Borg

				I have to say, it annoys the piss out of me when I see someone saying it. It&#039;s like &quot;Our team has received your order for 1 ounce of Sour Diesel. It has already been through our Order Fulfillment department. It was processed by our Packaging department yesterday, but it must be reviewed and approved by our Quality Assurance department before it can be sent to our Shipping department.&quot; Then when you receive it, it&#039;s wrapped in a Walmart grocery bag, and there&#039;s a piece of paper duct taped and stapled to it that says &quot;Sour D&quot; written in chicken scratch with a Sharpie. If an ounce of weed has to spend more than 1 day with a vendor before being shipped out, that shit better look like it was processed by the cartels themselves.

				This is something of a pet peeve of mine, yet it is one I am forced to do, as &quot;I&quot; represent a &quot;we&quot;.

As such, I can be speaking for myself or for us as a whole.<br /><br />But it makes me feel like I have schizophrenia at times.

				Even if there is multiple people, there is only one person typing the message, so it should be sent first person or third person (SWIM etc), makes no sense to multi. But hey ho, who cares. plus theres lots of different languages and backgrounds all coming together to speak in English only here, so, bound to be lil hiccups eh?

				We&#039;re talking linguistics here. When talking, depending on the audience, you select a sociolinguistic register.<br /><br />As a speaker, you choose your way of speaking depending on the situation. I speak English to everybody I know, my mother, my boss, my girlfriend, my young nephews and my friends. It&#039;s the same language. However, to each of those persons, I speak in a different way. (And so do you.)<br /><br />To your boss you speak in a formal way, to young children in a simplified way, and to your friends in an informal way.<br /><br />In the same way you have a language register you use when you&#039;re representing a business. Many times companies refer to themselves as &quot;we&quot;. This is accepted professional language. When Silk Road vendors&nbsp; write their pages, they select the same language register. And that includes the use of &quot;we&quot; when referring to the business. Even if it is a one man operation. You could say that in this context, the word has lost it&#039;s aspect of plurality.<br /><br />

				Hey don&#039;t go criticizing us. You&#039;ll find that schizophrenic vendors are the best vendors of all! The extra voices in our head keeps us company while packing all your orders. Sometimes they even tell us to give you more product to be nice and that makes everyone happy!

				I was being hypothetical when I mentioned the walmart bag with duct tape. Just stating my point in easy to understand terms, I suppose.<br /><br />Anyways, I just think it&#039;s not the greatest idea to try to sound like a multi-person operation because if your order is any less than perfect, you can&#039;t say &quot;Well I&#039;m *WAY* too busy to make sure each and every one of these packages is perfect!&quot;, because you&#039;re trying to make your buyer think that there are numerous people, all with a specialty, so the whole package should be specialized.

Another theory is that it&#039;s a remnant of the Roman Empire. <br /><br />At some point, the Roman empire split in two, you had the western empire (with Rome as the capital) and the eastern Byzantine empire (with Constantinople as it&#039;s capital). At that point, Rome had two emperors. However, they were still sort of working together, so it was common practice to address the emperor with the plural form of you. And they would refer to themselves as &quot;we&quot;. Because when you talked to one emperor, you talked to both.<br /><br />English is kinda weird, in that it only has one form of &quot;you&quot;. Many other languages have various. Like Spanish, that has an informal you (tú), a formal you (usted), and a you-plural (in Spain itself, they actually have two you-plurals, the formal and the informal version. So they have 4 different words for &quot;you&quot;).<br /><br />When you&#039;re talking French, there&#039;s also various ways of saying &quot;you&quot;. If you talk to one person you say &quot;tu&quot;, if you talk to more than one, you say &quot;vous&quot;. However, if you are talking to somebody and you want to be really polite, you say &quot;vous&quot;, even if it&#039;s just one person. What you basically do is you pretend he is the Roman Emperor (at least, that&#039;s where the custom originates from). <br />
