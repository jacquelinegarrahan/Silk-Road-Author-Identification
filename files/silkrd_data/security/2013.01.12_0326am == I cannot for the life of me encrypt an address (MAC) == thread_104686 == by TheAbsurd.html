				The title says it all. I downloaded GPG Keychain Access. I imported kwiktrip&#039;s pgp code and it shows up on the software. So I got into a place where I can type the address, highlight it and do CMD SHIFT E to encrypt it, and it shows a list of vendors but not the one I&#039;m looking for. I even tried it on my other Mac, and my last resort is to use my mother&#039;s Mac (fucking macfag family), but I don&#039;t wanna do that on her computer obviously. Is there another way to encrypt with a Mac?! I need to do it by tomorrow because kwiktrip is going on vacation! Help me please, and I apologize if this post made no sense, this is a drug forum and I am on drugs.<br /><br />EDIT: I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m doing it the right way. I always seem to have this problem. I&#039;ve been on SR for a while now but still...

				This is a post by Guru, which should help you.<br /><br />This is a known issue with the standard build. What you want to do is install the latest nightly build, per the following instructions (originally written by Guru)<br /><br />GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X<br />you have, it may or may not work as expected.&nbsp; If you have Leopard (10.5)<br />then you&#039;re pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using<br />the command-line.<br /><br />If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the<br />following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and<br />running.<br /><br />Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into<br />System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check<br />mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.<br /><br />Keyboard shortcuts:<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.<br /><br />N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you<br />need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do<br />that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration<br />menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button<br />is selected.<br /><br />Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences:<br />smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.<br /><br />To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire<br />document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to<br />verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only<br />plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to<br />bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is<br />checked.<br /><br />Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then<br />encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of<br />keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:<br /><br />Other Commands You May Need:<br />============================<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br /><br />Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the<br />recipient&#039;s PGP public key.<br /><br />Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste<br />it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file,<br />import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be<br />found in the Documents folder.<br /><br />Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the<br />Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then<br />prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It<br />will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the<br />file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key<br />will then be imported into your PGP keyring.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a<br />TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then<br />use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in<br />your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you<br />can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message<br />to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR).<br /><br />When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will<br />be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the<br />encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else<br />that it needs to go.<br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that<br />message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use<br />Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D<br />to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key,<br />you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase<br />has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted,<br />and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing<br />the encrypted message that was there previously.<br /><br />Guru&nbsp;
