				Anyone had any success with this? would really be helpful for getting safe drops.<br />seen a guy selling some on the road but I really don&#039;t want to pay over £100 for one when there&#039;s probably a way to get one myself.<br />Thanks for any help guys.

This thread gave me the idea to create a Master Index thread for Prepaid Cards all over the World with prices/terms/availability etc., I would need some data to get going with it first though. :)

				There isn&#039;t a problem getting these in the UK - just buy them from anyone of the many vendors here and elsewhere? they are 20 quid ish in the right place.

				I&#039;ve got two, one from the polish bank that everyone on here seems to use and one is a UK one which is bit more complicated in getting anonymously but probably easier to use to cash out as it&#039;s a UK account attached to it.

				You sirs are looking for the IDT Prime pre-paid Mastercard. Available from multiple outlets for a fee of £5. Can be topped up anywhere there is a Paypoint sign. <br /><br />They can be registered online at which point you provide a name and address, if you like.<br /><br />Be aware there are piss-taking charges involved whenever you spend cash that you have loaded on the card, the same piss-taking charges are also applied for NOT spending the cash you have loaded on the card. That said they are as anonymous as it gets - obviously CCTV in the newsagent where you buy them is a potential issue as is the place you top them up.

				Thank you so much soca, I&#039;m assuming you can use a fake name and address when registering it online, anyhow There&#039;s a few stores near me that supply them so I&#039;ll Definitely give it a go.

				No problems. yes you can register anything you like.<br /><br />Remember though that some payment processors (like Worldpay for instance) will do a bunch of checks when you make an online payment one of which will be to check the address exists and perhaps even to see if the name and address you supply can be correlated with other records such as electoral role or other credit cards etc. They then provide a risk rating on the transaction to the vendor. Just use a valid name and address in that case.<br />
