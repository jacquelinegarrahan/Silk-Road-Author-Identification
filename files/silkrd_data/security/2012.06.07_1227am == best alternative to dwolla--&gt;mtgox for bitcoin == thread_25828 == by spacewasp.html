				so i just got an email from dwolla saying my funds cleared, went over to mtgox and saw the bullshit about how they need an ID from you to continue, then came over here and saw that i&#039;m not the only one who said &quot;fuck that!&quot;<br /><br />so what are my fellow americans doing to get BTC now?&nbsp; last time I checked, all the moneypak--&gt;BTC exchangers charge an absurdly high fee (like getting 60 bucks worth of coin for 100USD), but i&#039;d be open to dealing with one who was trustworthy and reasonable in cost.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;m also open to any other method.<br /><br />sorry if this seems ad nauseum, but i just found out about this and am super annoyed without a way to get BTC

				I now use Bitinstant. They charge a commission of approx 4% <br /><br />but they are more anonymous than Dwolla since you simply <br /><br />hand a bank teller a deposit slip without having to give your <br /><br />name. You can go Bitinstant---mtgox, but I recommend <br /><br />Bitinstant---Coinapult since IMO mtgox are a bunch of thieving <br /><br />rats.<br /><br />Good Luck and Happy Trails :)

				I just got &quot;verified&quot; over there with the fbi (Mt. Gox) haha.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t see me post in the next few weeks you&#039;ll know why.&nbsp; Bastards.&nbsp; Oh well, at least I found out some good info about it here on SR first.&nbsp; What was shady as fuck, was the email they send you saying everyone using Dwolla was going to have to give ID- but then you could still go to your account and send money from Dwolla, only then do you find out (as some fellow Silk Roaders did) that you can kiss your money bye-bye unless you send an ID in.&nbsp; And then they have a clause there when you do saying, we do not provide this information to law enforcement except where required by law.&nbsp; Or something like that.&nbsp; Wow how reassuring!&nbsp; :(
