				I am fairly new in SR, and I&#039;ve just downloaded the PGP encryption program, and are ready to learn how to use it.<br />But thats not what this topic is about. <br /><br />I just dont quite know when and where do I use this encryption? In my orders or in PM&#039;s on silkroad?? <br />i dont quite get it, isn&#039;t Tor already encrypted?<br /><br />Please enlighten me :)

				Tor encrypts the connection between you and the server, it doesn&#039;t encrypt data stored on the server. The server admins have to do that, but it&#039;s even safer if you encrypt it yourself so that only the recipient can read it, which is the purpose of PGP.<br /><br />Generally you should:<br /><br />1. Encrypt your address<br />2. Encrypt other personal info or sensitive details that you only want the recipient to read.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to encrypt every message to a vendor or every PM, in fact that wastes people&#039;s time.

				As far as PGP for PMs, it depends on the message you are sending. If you are asking a vendor, for example, about the stealth they use packaging orders or shipping times, I think its a good idea to encrypt. If the shit were to hit the fan and LE somehow gained access to the messages, they could determine that you were intending to buy drugs.<br /><br />Stay safe

The main things you definitely should encrypt are your address when placing orders with vendors and any personally identifiable information on you or the packaging a vendor uses, including package tracking numbers. Things such as general chit chat and request prices or asking questions to a vendor don&#039;t need to be encrypted generally. Just apply common sense and if you&#039;re unsure, encrypt it just to be safe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This ^. Some vendors in the past have referred buyers to privnote b/c they didn&#039;t know how to PGP. And DO NOT PGP your address or incriminating details on third party encryption servers either. Ask me or someone else to PGP with you to pick it up, if you haven&#039;t learnt already, and do it the normal way where you have control over both your key and your message. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
