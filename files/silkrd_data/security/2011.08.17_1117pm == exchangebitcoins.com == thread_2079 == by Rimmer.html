				I have not. bitcoinexchange.cc and bitcoinbux.com both issue coins generally within an hour or less if you pay with green dot moneypack. If you do use exchangebitcoins.com plz post a review so others will be aware of that option.

				Never use anything that has your name on it directly with SR. Use a tumbler and/or several wallets in between. Wallet likely means an ewallet like mybitcoin or an actual bitcoin wallet on a computer. I usually send from mtgox&gt;tumbler&gt;ewallet&gt;wallet. Then wallet&gt;ewallet&gt;tumbler&gt;SR for deposits. So has anyone actually used exchangebitcoins.com to exchange bitcoins? I am curious how it stacks to the other sources mentioned in previous posts.

				nope no moneypak. You can go into a chase or wellsfargo bank and deposit money into their account. It still makes me nervous that they are so new and that their volume is so low. Like I said in another thread about them, for me to want to use them, they would have to be in business longer. <br /><br />There have been too many bitcoin scams/issues for me to get excited about this one. I hope it&#039;s not one of those lets see how many millions can get deposited and then &quot;oops, sorry, we&#039;ve been hacked&quot; excuses comes along. I dont see them holding too much money right now, but when they get big and there are millions upon millions of dollars deposited with them. They might just&nbsp; &nbsp;run. I know my thinking is probably uber paranoid, but I would have never thought what happened at mybitoin would happen either....<br /><br />Even though mt. gox and Trade hill have had their issues, mt. gox has proved themselves by coming back bigger and stronger and i believe that if werent for those 2, especially mt. gox, the bitcoin would be nowhere. Mt Gox is owned and operated by a large corporation, The new excangebitcoin is some sort of start up. How well is their backing? there are a lot things you have to consider before trusting someone with even a few hundred of your hard earned dollars. Most likely, they will be ok and thrive, but ill try them after the have been open for a month.

				Ya I couldn&#039;t find any reviews of them, but they seemed very professional.<br /><br />After doing one cash deposit, I am very satisfied with their low fees, speed and customer service.&nbsp; I have to admit the idea of a cash deposit and mailing and image of a receipt felt pretty fucked up... but in the end they came through and im happy with them.&nbsp; I will use them again

				bitcoinexchange.cc took 2.5 days to process my moneypak recently. apparently they had a mp backlog and can only process them at a certain rate or greendot will cut them off. to their credit the coins came fast once the mp cleared, and they were mostly very responsive to e-mails. however their delay estimates were way off (they kept saying it would happen &quot;soon&quot;, &quot;today&quot;, etc.<br /><br />they are legit though and i&#039;d use them again. maybe check in first to see how backed up they are with mp orders.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2079.msg17460#msg17460">Quote from: vanilla on August 18, 2011, 12:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have not. bitcoinexchange.cc and bitcoinbux.com both issue coins generally within an hour or less if you pay with green dot moneypack.
