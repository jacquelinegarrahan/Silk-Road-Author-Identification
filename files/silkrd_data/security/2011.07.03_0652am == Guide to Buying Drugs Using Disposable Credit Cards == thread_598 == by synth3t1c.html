				I know Silk Road has a tumbler, but that&#039;s not the point. There are people who rather not link their bank account to any website or because they don&#039;t have access to their bank account like teenagers.<br /><br />Go to a store and buy a Vanilla Visa card or the MasterCard equivalent - whichever you prefer. If you&#039;re extra paranoid, wear a hoodie or sunglasses. And obviously, don&#039;t use a membership card if applicable (like CVS ExtraCare, etc). Wait maximum 24 hours for the card to activate. (12 hours for me)<br /><br />Using the Tor network follow the steps below:<br /><br />Create an email address at hushmail.com or any other email sites.<br /><br />Go to centregold.com and create an account there using the email address you made. For the phone number and address, just put in some bullshit. I used the address of some random post office and their phone number. You may see some warning about it not being on public records, just ignore it and continue.<br /><br />Go to libertyreserve.com and create an account. Link your Liberty Reserve to your centregold account. Then, using the credit card you bought to buy some Liberty Reserve money.<br /><br />Next, create a Mt. Gox account and transfer the Liberty Reserve funds to your Mt. Gox account and buy some Bitcoins.<br /><br />Finally, you&#039;re able to buy drugs without any evidence (most likely)! (Just don&#039;t have login info for any of your accounts on any websites anywhere)<br /><br />Also, they can&#039;t prove it was you who ordered the drugs if they ever intercept the package. Who knows, it could be your neighbor using your name and address with plans to &quot;steal&quot; the package before you checked your mail. ;)

				Has anyone tried just sending cash or money order to Mt. Gox? If that works it seems much simpler, although wait is obviously a drawback.

				Pretty much any LR exchanger also accepts WU which is faster and easier than using a prepaid CC imo.

				synth3t1c &quot;don&#039;t have access to their bank account like teenagers&quot;<br /><br />Neither myself or any other member of GreenCo wants to sell marijuana to kids. We know kids smoke pot but hopefully ours is too expensive. If we even suspect someone is not an adult we will not sell to them. I do not think anyone in the Silk Road community should encourage or in any way make it easier for kids to buy drugs. <br /><br />This is one of many reasons why marijuana should be legal. I wish there was a way for us to verify people&#039;s ages

				You can get your bitcoins through SilkRoad.&nbsp; Just go to the money section and look for somebody selling bitcoins (who&#039;s got good reviews).&nbsp; Then you send them the money through the mail and they transfer the bitcoins to your account.<br /><br />When it comes time to cashout, just do the reverse and have them send you cash.<br /><br />Needless to say this takes longer than the other methods, but you won&#039;t create a trail, plus it&#039;s a lot simpler.

				@todamnhellit: &quot;I&#039;ve done it, but I had to take an extra step and use a fake Dwolla account because of Mt. Gox not allowing user to user transfers (something or other).&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m in the same situation right now, but after 3 days of a new account being open, Dwolla emailed me saying they tried calling my bullshit phone number and need to verify some shit. anyone experienced this? i sent some money orders to Bitcoin Morpheus and am now worried it&#039;ll get locked in there if Dwolla suspends my account.

				Well, I made the Dwolla account immediately beforehand, then transferred the funds to Mt. Gox so Dwolla couldn&#039;t get a chance to lock my account or some garbage. Hopefully the Bitcoin Morpheus service can return to normal soon.
