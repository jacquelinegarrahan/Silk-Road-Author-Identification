				Consider how carefully vendors like that treat your address / personal info when they copy it off the SR server.<br /><br />There&#039;s a highly sensitive period between when they get it off the server and put it on the package. Comments like that tell you exactly how carefully they regard your info.<br /><br />

				Privnote just seems ludicrously insecure to me. What&#039;s to stop an adversary from intercepting your communication, opening your privnote, reading the contents and then creating a new privnote to replace it? You aren&#039;t going to know the link is different.&nbsp; Even less sophisticated, what if someone else just opens it? Sure you&#039;re going to know it been compromised, but its too late then; your secret has been&nbsp; discovered.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are a worrying number of vendors who can&#039;t be bothered to learn PGP. I&#039;ll be honest, Ive used some of them and just sent my Addy plaintext. Privnote just seems a total waste of time. I guess I should boycott these lazy vendors. Its not that difficult to use PGP for fucks sake.

				Found one and only one vendor with something I wanted, and who would sell to me. He didn&#039;t want to use PGP, said it&#039;s no biggie, &quot;it&#039;s more trouble than it&#039;s worth.&quot; <br /><br />Never so fast did I lose interest in a vendor. Even if he wises up and decides to start using it, I can see it because he realized fewer people wanted to buy from him - NOT because he realizes how important it is. If he&#039;s this lazy/careless/stupid in this department, who knows where else in his operation he finds things more trouble than they are worth. <br /><br />

				I refused to buy from a vendor just a week ago, he had very good prices, but no PGP-Key. Wrote him a pm, but he ignored it.

				1024 bit key will probably be crackable within 5 years, and by that I mean that a computer cluster might be able to crack them in a few months.<br /><br />It&#039;s probably too much effort for an SR vendor, but 1024 bit keys are still considered weak.<br />

				Yeah, but what if someone hacks the computer of a vendor? Come on. Saying &quot;it&#039;s not really necessary&quot; is just a silly thing to say. Unless every vendor is a network security specialist and knows how to avoid social engineering, then it is definitely necessary.

				Consider it a litmus test for intelligence and security-consciousness, then: if a vendor tells you they refuse to learn or use PGP, they&#039;re doing you a favor in letting you know they&#039;re not that bright, and that they have a fucked up sense of priorities. <br /><br />On the other hand, I&#039;d love to see what would happen if Mr. Please-Avoid-PGP gets caught: <br /><br />&gt;&gt; Yes, your Honor, I get it, but c&#039;mon.

DPR employs a team (however small) of admins to work on the site.

My rule-of-thumb: as with the clearnet, assume that all your posts and PMs are public.

				Right, I mean if a vendor won&#039;t allow you to use PGP in placing your order or doesn&#039;t have a public key posted, it means they either don&#039;t understand security thoroughly, or they don&#039;t care much about your security. The would be a red flag in my opinion. Sure it can take a few practice tries to figure out PGP, but anyone who can figure out how to download tor and find SR can figure out PGP too.

				Another reason for vendors to have PGP keys is that it&#039;s their proof of identity in a pseudonymous community. There was a case where a vendor&#039;s market and forum accounts were hacked. He had to create a new forum account to inform his customers about it, and the mods requested that he sign a statement with his PGP key. There are a variety of situations where a vendor would want to prove his identity, and a PGP key is the best way do it.

				To decrypt the messages (as buyer addresses etc.) they will need the password for the key and assuming the person isn&#039;t an idiot to have an easily crackable one and/or to put it somewhere that can be find easily, nobody even having the key can decrypt the messages.<br /><br />So even assuming that LE can find the vendor secret key (and this is already difficult in itself - i.e. almost impossible, again if one isn&#039;t an idiot - since you should use Tails or a Whonix VM etc. with an encrypted persistent volume &amp; co. if you want to store data) this alone will not suffice for them to be able to decrypt messages.

Having GPG most certainly doesn&#039;t ensure your security though. Hell, not using GPG doesn&#039;t even ensure that you will be compromised. If you don&#039;t use GPG to send your address over SR then your security is dependent on the server never being seized while it is in a vulnerable state (ie: booted on), everybody who has legitimate access to the server being honest and non-malicious, and the server never being penetrated by malicious hackers. Now, the server is almost always on so if it is seized then you are pretty fucked. Tor is better than nothing anonymity for servers, but everybody knows that hidden services are not the most anonymous things in the world. Not to mention there is always the risk that the server will leak its IP address etc. We are pretty positive at this point that DPR is legitimate currently, and we hope that the people he picked to have access to the server are legitimate, but people can of course turn to the enemy if they are compromised, and it is not unheard of for undercovers to infiltrate criminal groups at a high level (ie: master splynter gained legitimate administrative access to a carder forum). As far as hackability goes, well at least 99.9999999% of software is hackable, and the software running SR is no different.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you use GPG then your security is dependent on extremely large composite numbers being difficult to factor into primes, and essentially all mathematicians believe that extremely large composite numbers are extremely difficult to factor into primes. <br /><br />So it is up to you if you want your security to rely on the anonymity of Tor hidden services (which is undoubtedly less than the anonymity of regular Tor clients), the security of the server (which is undoubtedly not perfectly secure), and the benevolence of the people with administrative access to the server (which is indeterminable), or if you want your security to rely on something that mathematicians hold to be fact (ie: that it is very hard to factor a very large composite number into primes).

				I&#039;m a moron for using pgp?&nbsp; Probably!&nbsp; Even a moron can learn how to use pgp!<br /><br />Maybe this vendor pays for his supply by bank transfer.&nbsp; Maybe even by credit card, after all it&#039;s even quicker, saves him his precious time!<br /><br /><br />Bottom line is, SR or not, dealing with narcotics is a delicate matter.&nbsp; If you&#039;re messing around with narcotics, (stay away from drugs people, they&#039;re bad!) your general priority is not getting busted or getting linked to someone who got busted.&nbsp; That&#039;s why in real life your customers or dealers shouldn&#039;t really know where you live.&nbsp; In real life you should use a different name.&nbsp; You should also wear unremarkable clothing (that means no gold chain, might be hard for some).<br />Not going to get into this too much but in real life a smart dealer or customer goes the extra mile to be discreet.&nbsp; Our practices after all aren&#039;t appreciated by a lot of people, not just LE.<br /><br />That is why I don&#039;t understand why someone wouldn&#039;t use pgp.&nbsp; Computers are so much better at storing information than humans.&nbsp; If you were to sell to someone at a party and this person got busted an hour later, and was compelled to describe who sold it to them, there&#039;s always a chance that person can&#039;t be as helpful as LE would like.&nbsp; Computers rarely get it wrong though.<br />Internet is becoming a part of society.&nbsp; Nowadays, posting on a forum is almost the same as going to a bar and having a random conversation with a stranger.&nbsp; You are also accountable for things you say on the internet.&nbsp; Dealing drugs on the streets or on the Road should therefore require the same amount of discretion.<br /><br />The Silk Road and computer software/technology allow us to further this discretion. MAKE THE MOST OF IT.<br /><br />To the vendor who was quoted : Sorry mate but most people here want to go the extra mile to stay out of prison and they should.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you&#039;re doing fine though and I wish you the best of luck.<br /><br />Random Off-topic Fact : If you think you&#039;re being followed, or you are following someone, on foot of course, remember : anyone can change their clothes in a few seconds without even carrying a bag - changing your shoes however!
