				I see a few vendors have gone and setup safe mail accounts. I was doing the same thing, and cannot seem to get it to load certain pages off of TOR. Until I wipe my hard drive I absolutely refuse to start importing PGP keys or anything like that. So my plan was to email myself all the vendor PGP keys and emails I need. However I cannot actually get to the compose mail page over TOR. I do not see the point in accessing this email over clear web either.<br /><br />So my question is, what am I doing wrong here? I sure hope the plan was not to communicate through safe-mail accessed over clear web. I&#039;m sure thats not the case and I must have done something wrong.<br /><br />We all need to get this figured out. Same as when the Grateful Dead stopped touring and all the LSD connections drifted apart, this community will take a huge hit if we don&#039;t get some sort of (%100) safe makeshift net work going in the mean time. We need to ban together folks. Lets not loose what we had done.

				safemail insists on opening up popups which tor browser blocks automatically and I suspect that could be your problem.<br /><br />tbh, safe-mail should just be a temporary resting place. Apart from the problem with the popups, I suspect it&#039;s the one run by the israelis and considering that the NSA gives the full data dump to Israel to sift through to see if it can find any threats against it, I doubt very much any Israeli company would be allowed to not give them the data too.<br />

I always loved the music and thought people&#039;s interpretation of the scene was getting out of hand. For instance the old myth about the significance of getting &quot;winged.&quot; it may have meant something at one point.

				I checked my safemail account through Tor, no problems.<br /><br />Hope you all get squared away soon.<br /><br />One feature of safemail, even if you are away for a few months, they keep your account active.<br /><br />OTOH, with 3MEG storage you will need to do some pruning periodically.

				I have been using safemail with tor for months with no issues. Just make sure you go to preferences, go to general and you will see &quot;IP checks&quot; turn them OFF as TOR changes you IP all the time and it will keep logging you out and making you retype your password unless you turn the IP check off! :)
