				So I read a news article about an Australia man was arrested after the drugs he ordered on Silk Road were confiscated.<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/australian-cops-tout-arrest-of-man-for-bitcoin-drug-deal/<br /><br />The man was unnamed but it doesn&#039;t say whether or not he&#039;s going to be convicted, or on what grounds he was arrested. Now Gawker has re-published an article on how authorities could start cracking down on the website. http://gawker.com/5926440/are-authorities-closing-in-on-the-online-drug-market-silk-road/<br /><br />I know I&#039;m sounding paranoid but is it possible that Silk Road could be numbered as law enforcement advances on this? Or is this just a fluke and the man wasn&#039;t very secretive about his activities?

				Australian customs probably just intercepted the package, then they got the name of the site out of him when they arrested him.. <br /><br />Ten counts with a weapons charge too, so it wasn&#039;t just an ounce of weed they busted him with. I&#039;d bet money that it was just a traditional bust.&nbsp; It can take weeks to months for standard mail to get down there, depending on where it was shipped from, and any sort of express deliveries get extra scrutiny.&nbsp; It&#039;s a hell of a time receiving anything down there, legal or not.&nbsp; It could have had the wrong paperwork on it for import taxes, or the packaging just didn&#039;t hold up, or leaked, or got x-rayed and they identified the contraband, etc.&nbsp;

				A dozen things could have happened, but the compromise of the Silk Road is not one of them.<br /><br />Aussie and Kiwi comrades ought to be especially careful, not because their Customs are particularly ingenious, but because Customs in certain countries like the Nordic ones and that part of the Pacific have a certain geographical advantage, partly due to the inefficiency of the postal system there.<br /><br />i.e. concentrated delivery points and/or long delivery times like Shinma says.<br /><br />The point is that you typically should clear your house of any contraband/SR relevant material and order 1 package at a time + wait until your receive that. Then RTS when you receive and ideally sit on it for a few days.<br /><br />The problem is of course, those long delivery times... It&#039;s always best to ship with standard basic shipping to hide in the aggregate.<br /><br />The result is that Kiwis and Aussies ought to plan their purchases well in advance, by weeks or even a month.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Eventually, with greater broadband penetration and a new generation of citizens, you&#039;ll have over 9000 times more packages circulating through the system from Amazon and Ebay, and then Customs will be completely swamped, so the general moral of the story is that Time is on your side, so use it, don&#039;t be impatient.<br /><br />

				I agree, The LE exagerate the charges, etc, and quote silk road, to try get more attention to the site. <br />Just this morn, my mate&nbsp; said, &quot;is that place you use called silkroad?&quot; &quot;yeah why&quot; &quot;cos there was a current affair thing about it the other night&quot;<br />Didnt like hearing that, but then again, the current affairs do the subjects that are paid top dollla for, or cause max controversy, and It wouldnt surprise me, if they do stories for the the Feds also. We just gotta be extra vigilant. if ya get busted, say &#039;i dont know who the fuck sent me that&#039;. If you have history say its probably an old enemy setting me up. Just dont even think the words silkroad.<br />If anything ever happanes,&nbsp; Im gonna deny I know anything about it, even if i have opened and used it. I aint got much form so i wont get time for opening someone elses package and using it, Err. whats up officer, i found this in my letterbox, i didnt order nothin, must be addressed wrong,&nbsp; i was being greedy, thats all officer.<br />Hope I neve have to see how ell that works huh ::)

				Police think they are one step ahead!? Seriously, maybe he is on drugs too?<br /><br />I think its just classic crime wave reporting, its been in the news in NZ and auz, as it gets more publicity, journalists read about it and re-report similar stuff... so they caught one guy out of how many aussies on this site? meh...

				If by &quot;cracking down&quot; you mean trying and failing so miserably that it&#039;s completely hilarious, yes.
