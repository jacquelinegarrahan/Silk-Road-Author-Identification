				I made a Bitinstant deposit today, but it was the first time that I ever used a BTC address instead of an intermediary like Mt. Gox. Well, I made 4 deposits right in a row, but only the first deposit has made it, and I&#039;m growing concerned about the other 3. I&#039;m sure that I&#039;m just being paranoid. Can someone tell me how long it normally takes for that option to work, and how much time there is between deposits? That way I still stop panicking

				I haven&#039;t used Bitinstant in a millennium but if it was the bank deposits you may or may not have triggered a suspicious activity alarm in their system but if it was a different method then you may just be waiting for them to get more funds cleared or something of that nature.

				Still haven&#039;t received most of the deposit... I received 1 out of 4, but the other 3 have not appeared. I e-mailed Bitinstant support but no response yet. I hope this can get resolved.

				You probably broke the rules.&nbsp; Don&#039;t try to pull a fast one on them you end up losing.

				^not sure why this guys implying you were &quot;pulling a fast one&quot;<br /><br />Which website did you send the bitcoins to?&nbsp; As in which website has the bitcoin address you sent the bitcoins to.&nbsp; Some websites automatically change your bitcoin address each time you receive a payment, so it would be worth it to go back on the website and check if the bitcoin address is still the same.&nbsp;

				I sent them to my SR wallet. Was this a mistake? The first one arrived without issue, the other 3 still have not been found and I can&#039;t find any information on Blockchain.info

				It&#039;s been about 18 hours since I received an e-mail from ZipZap saying the orders went through, followed by 4 e-mails from Bitinstant saying that my orders had been &quot;updated.&quot; It usually takes no more than 3 hours for an order to come through. Like I said, one came through just fine, but the other 3 have not arrived. I&#039;ve tried e-mailing Bitinstant support with no response. I also messaged SR support, no response yet, but I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll get to it eventually. <br />&nbsp;<br />Can someone explain to me how I&#039;m supposed to read the Blockchain.info page for my address? It says that 2 transactions have been completed: the first one is receiving the BTC amount for one order, and the second is sending that exact same amount away. What does this mean? I&#039;m baffled right now. Would it be a security risk if I just posted my address here so someone can take a look at the page? Or can a trusted forum member PM me and I&#039;ll link you to the Blockchain page? I&#039;m starting to panic here.

				Its been 4 days now and SR still hasn&#039;t received my coins from Bitmarket. Was only a small amount. Every other transaction went through ok, some quicker than others, but my latest one has been 4 days now..cant believe it.<br /><br />But yeah 18hrs is too long also. I heard sending coins straight to SR is fine, but maybe not..? ???

				I&#039;ve always used BitInstant and sent them straight to my SR wallet.&nbsp; The longest that it has took it 2 hours...18 seems very very suspicious.&nbsp; What happens in a situation where they believe you are using the BTC for criminal reasons? I assume they just seize it and lock the account but I have no idea.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck man.

It&#039;s normal and nothing to worry about. All that matters are the incoming BTC.

				Hmm, well SR doesn&#039;t automatically change your address each time you receive a payment.&nbsp; Is it possible you changed it since you made the withdrawal? (as in clicked the &quot;get new address&quot; button)
