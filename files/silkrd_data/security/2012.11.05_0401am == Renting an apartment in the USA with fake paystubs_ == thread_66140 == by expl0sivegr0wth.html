				Generated through an software..............<br /><br /><br />I can pay my rent but I don&#039;t make enough at my work on my salary to legitimately afford an apartment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can this be possible?&nbsp; Do they actually look to see how much I made, can they?

				They don&#039;t double check the pay stubs, they have no way of doing so.<br />I did the same thing, printed the pay stubs, W2&#039;s, even the tax returns<br />and bank statements for my $6500/mo. apartment. All fake.

				Totally possible. I&#039;ll even make a few up for you in exchange for some BTC if you don&#039;t know how to do it yourself.&nbsp; 8)

				Faked bank statements are golden. I&#039;ve personally seen falsified bank statements allow people to obtain commercial leases (5k/month, 10 years). It&#039;s also not usually something that they ask for, so when you volunteer it, you look prepared. It&#039;s also not possible for them to check whether the information is actually true. You can&#039;t just call up a bank and say, &quot;Hey, what&#039;s the balance on so-and-so&#039;s account?&quot;<br /><br />Fake pay stubs run the risk of your employer calling your workplace to verify. Of course, if you&#039;re already faking the pay stub, it&#039;s probably small potatoes to slip in a fake phone number that forwards to you or a friend of yours. Or just give them a burner number, and tell them that it&#039;s your boss&#039; work phone. Have a buddy record the VM message.<br /><br />This fraud, as with most fraud, depends a lot on your ability to sell it. Experienced landlords have a pretty finely-tuned BS detector, and you can bet that they&#039;ll investigate more deeply if they catch a whiff of shit.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re dealing with the landlord directly, and not a broker or rental company, try being upfront about your situation. All the landlord is trying to do is ensure that he/she doesn&#039;t get screwed. If you can convince them that you&#039;ll be a great tenant, then it might be as simple as putting down an extra month&#039;s deposit, or paying a little extra in rent every month.<br /><br />I&#039;m always a fan of Mark Twain&#039;s &quot;If you tell the truth, you don&#039;t have to remember anything.&quot; strategy. Makes my life easier, for sure.

				Go prepared to your application and it will go a long way to getting whatever you want.<br /><br />Have a bank statement, a paystub, your photo id etc ready and people wont think twice.<br /><br />Unless your applying amongst many others for a sought after apartment, chances are the window dressing you put on will suffice. Landlords need renters, they just want to weed out the scumbags. As long as from then on you pay your rent, no worries.

				Yup. Photoshop. Print out on the computer, photocopy to remove pixels, and boom! You&#039;re in business.
