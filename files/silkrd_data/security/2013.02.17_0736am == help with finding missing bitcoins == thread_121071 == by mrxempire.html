				ok, so I know I&#039;ve posted about this problem in other topics within the last 24 hours, but I am having trouble locating the 4 bitcoins that I deposited in the supermarket the other day. The deeper i dig, the more confusing things get. From what Ive learned so far, it is bitinstant.coms fault, not Silk road&#039;s. Usually when I go to bitinstant and fill everything out, I use my tormail account as the email, and once I&#039;ve gone to the store and paid my moneygram slip, they send me an email that says &quot;my order has been updated&quot; or something like that. I received no email from bitinstant so far, and it has been almost two days since I went to the supermarket to put money on my SR account. Someone told me to check blockchain.info to see if my transaction is recorded there. I put my silk road bitcoin address in the search bar, and The last recorded transaction on blockchain was during the end of january. There is no record of my trip to the supermarket. I honestly don&#039;t see what went wrong. If I put the wrong numbers on the moneygram slip, the cashier won&#039;t be able to finalize the transfer, so I had to have put all the right information in. I am going to try and call bitinstant on monday and see if I can talk to a live person about this issue. They are closed during the weekend though. Does anyone here have any idea what could have happened? I got a receipt from the supermarket, so i don&#039;t think the lady just pocketed the money. I know 85 dollars isn&#039;t a lot of money to you guys, but I just saved up enough money to get a 5 strip from tesselated, and I&#039;m not going to be able to put more money on my account for quite some time. Any advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated

				those services might be down, but i would assume that payments that were submitted prior to them taking the services down should be processed - even if manually.<br /><br />you need to email bitinstant support, or try calling them tomorrow.&nbsp; if all else fails, post on bitcointalk.org because the owner of the company is usually online there.&nbsp; his name is Yankee.

				<br />Bitinstant, along with several other BTC exchanges, were attacked over the last few days, resulting in outages like crazy.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t done so already, email bitinstant, give them the Quote ID if you have it (if not, give them the ZipZap account number you used to make the transfer), and get them working on it.&nbsp; Meanwhile, head over to (CLEARNET WARNING) www.bitcointalk.org.&nbsp; Register for an account, post something (anything), and then go to the Newbie sub-board.&nbsp; There you will find the BitInstant Support Thread.&nbsp; You can post the details of your problem there, or send a PM to Yankee, the BitInstant CEO.&nbsp; If you paid the money in, he will make sure that either the transfer goes through (with the processing fee refunded), or that you get a full refund, whichever you prefer.&nbsp; It&#039;s, like, 0330 on the east coast right now, though, so I wouldn&#039;t necessarily expect an answer until later this morning.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

When you say &quot;clearnet warning&quot; does that mean that it&#039;s bad to access the site via tor, or a regular web browser? Sorry, Im a noob. I attempted to email bitinstant 2 days ago. Since I did not have/ was not sure what the quote I.D was, I just put my zipzap account number in the quote I.D field. When it asked for my email address, I gave them my tormail address. Was that a bad idea? They still haven&#039;t emailed me back. I also filled out my moneygram slip with a fake name, so if I call bitinstant support on the phone, should I just give them my fake name, address and phone number? Or will they ask for valid identification or something. Most likely I will just go to bitcointalk.org and try talking to the CEO like you guys suggested. I just need you to explain what you meant by &quot;clearnet warning&quot; just to be safe. It&#039;s been like three days since I went to the supermarket, so I hope Im not too late.

				I only had a problem with missing bitcoins once with bitinstant, and I didn&#039;t notice the issue for 2 weeks (traveling). I emailed them, and 2 emails was all it took to get everything straightened out. They&#039;re usually very helpful!!!

				curious... I had some bitcoins deposited in to the &#039;supermarket&#039; (I presume that means our favourite site) - go missing.&nbsp; I took the address straight off the SR deposit page... SR said it&#039;s not one of theirs but I&#039;m curious about this attack....<br /><br />Why would someone do that?&nbsp; Could be the authorities at work or am I just being paranoid and need some fresh air...

				I deposited some BCs on Saturday around the time of the weekend crash and they never turned up even though they were split up and forwarded on 15 minutes later. Suspected hacking initially but now suspect the SR crash did something. Second deposit worked fine though.

				It sounds like you&#039;re saying that you confirmed (blockchain?) that the transfer was made, but the BTCs never made it to your SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />If that&#039;s the case, then there *should* be a transaction trail on blockchain, but maybe not.&nbsp; Your best best is to email SR Support from within SR, and if you don&#039;t get a response there, you can try the Customer Support sub-board here on the forums.&nbsp; That&#039;s assuming that the first deposit cleared bitinstant.&nbsp; You should have gotten a verification email from bitinstant, not just ZipZap, and then, of course, you&#039;d see the transaction in blockchain.<br /><br />The probability that your SR account was hacked is very, very low.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just a function of the glitch.<br /><br />

				hey just letting everyone know my bitcoins appeared in my wallet today. 5 days after I paid my moneygram slip. For those having the same problem as me, you should probably see your BTC returned to you soon.<br /><br />P.S: for those who were wondering what I meant by &quot;supermarket&quot;: It wasn&#039;t code for Silk Road. I literally go to my local supermarkets help desk to pay the moneygram slip that puts the BTC on my S account lmao

				Hey, that&#039;s great news, mrxempire.&nbsp; The timing of that SR glitch couldn&#039;t have ceen worse, since it coincided with several DOS attacks on several BTC exchanges, including bitinstant.&nbsp; Glad you finally got your funds, and hope you&#039;re not burned on the whole process.

				I finally got my money in to SR, second time around.&nbsp; The address I first used is &#039;not recognised&#039; by SR staff which is strange as I took it straight from their website, copy and paste, from my deposit page.&nbsp; Well someone&#039;s enjoying my money.<br /><br />Second lot came through almost instantly.&nbsp; Still hopeful my first batch will turn up.&nbsp; I let support know that the address is definitely one of theirs.&nbsp; So now I know I was NOT hacked, so I have not f&#039;ing idea what happened, and neither do Silk Road apparently.<br /><br />Something got lost in the crash.&nbsp; The address I got second time around was different, I know that.
