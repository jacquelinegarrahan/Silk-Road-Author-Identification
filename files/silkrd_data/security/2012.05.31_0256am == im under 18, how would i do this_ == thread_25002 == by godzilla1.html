				You don&#039;t need a bank account. In fact it would be foolish to use one in my opinion as your real information would be tied to it. Do you live in the US? If so I would recommend Bitinstant, just fill the form out on their website and go to your nearest Chase bank and make the deposit in the exact amount. You do not need to leave your name to do this. <br /><br />Do not use the Bank of America option, from what I hear they ask way too many questions over there<br /><br /><br />And just ignore the people who drone about your age, your body is yours to do as you please with, just don&#039;t be an idiot and don&#039;t run around school telling everyone.

				Fucking hell this &quot;age shit&quot; is such a load of crap. Like everyone else wasn&#039;t popping pills and doing lines below the age of 18. I know I was, I dropped my first E when I was 14 and was doing Bing/speed etc at that age too.<br /><br />And absolute LOL at the &quot;You are only old enough for pot and shrooms, no hard shit, sorry&quot;. Absolutely fucking ridiculous attitude to take. What exactly are we classing as &quot;Hard shit&quot; here? Because cannabis can make you paranoid as fuck (the reason I don&#039;t smoke it) and shrooms you can spin the fuck out on and do all sorts of crazy shit on. I know I have. If you are going to allow pot and shrooms you should have absolutely fuck all problem with Bing/MDMA and the other jolly customers. The only ones that should be a massive no-no is Smack, Crack, Meth and the other highly addictive Opiates and probably PCP.<br /><br />And also, why the fuck are we telling this kid to go elsewhere where he will probably get absolute crap on the streets. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not advocate selling to kids, at all. The fact is though the guy/girl/kangaroo is here now and they are clearly going to find out how to buy drugs from SR, you may as well point them in the RIGHT direction so they don&#039;t either A. get ripped off or B. buy some bent shit that could land them in A+E. <br /><br />@ MycoGirl, stop being such a stereotypical hippie retard that thinks that &quot;natural is the safest&quot; because you are so out west you may as well be in Japan. All drugs have risks attached to them which is why you have to be responsible with them. <br /><br />@BigBill, read the above twice and stop being such a tosser. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know where the fuck the common sense has gone on here but Jesus Christ I wish it would come back. <br /><br />@ Godzilla1, if you want decent LSD then I suggest you go to 3Jane, she is a very reputable vendor and has quality product. Shrooms I don&#039;t know much about or the vendors for them but just make sure you read the vendors history carefully and view their stats etc so you can find the most reliable source. I HIGHLY suggest you read the reviews that are available in the Rumor Mill forum and do some research on them. Regarding how to get BTC if you are an American then getting a MoneyPak and going to CoinBox is probably your most fast and easiest route.

				Go Limetless! it doesn&#039;t matter how fucking old you are! I turn 18 in 3 days and I have been around doing this shit almost since the beginning of SR. And you know what I have done since? I have rolled twice since I discovered the road and dropped acid 5 or 6 times and smoked a lot of weed. Nothing else. This has been over a period of nine months. This place is so we can get quality and pure product with out the sketchiness of dealing with your local street dealer. Kids are gonna do drugs, so let em get the best they can get, fuck getting all the cut bull shit. Its rediculous that age has to matter so much in society when I can say I am more mature than a lot of people 10 years older than me and I am smart with what I put in my body and how often I do it, so why is it I should have this taken away. This freedom is for EVERYBODY.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				Indeed.<br /><br />Just to clarify here I am NOT saying that drugs should be sold to kids at all. I personally wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable knowingly selling to anyone below say 17 years old. What I am saying though is that if people under the age of 18 can find their way here then I&#039;m pretty damn fucking sure they are going to be able to work out how to use SR in a fair short space of time so just telling them to go back to the street is fucking pointless and actually highly irresponsible considering the higher % of probability that things can go wrong on the street. You may as well help them use this place and drugs responsibly if they are here because they aren&#039;t just going to go away just because some po-faced tossers say &quot;Oh you are too young to do drugs because I did it when I was that age and now I have worked out my own moral compass on the subject&quot;. It&#039;s an absolute TWAT attitude to take and to be frank, I expected better from people on here.

				Guys don&#039;t bullshit the kid. If was smart enough to make it onto here and do all that which he described in his post, then he can more than enough handle what the site has to offer. He&#039;s not a goddamn 4 year old on a playground.<br /><br /><br />I am willing to bet that each of you that posted here knows damn well that in your teenage years you experimented with drugs, so don&#039;t patronize the kid.

The fact is though the guy/girl/kangaroo is here now and they are clearly going to find out how to buy drugs from SR, you may as well point them in the RIGHT direction so they don&#039;t either A. get ripped off or B. buy some bent shit that could land them in A+E. <br /><br />@ MycoGirl, stop being such a stereotypical hippie retard that thinks that &quot;natural is the safest&quot; because you are so out west you may as well be in Japan. All drugs have risks attached to them which is why you have to be responsible with them. <br /><br />@BigBill, read the above twice and stop being such a tosser. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know where the fuck the common sense has gone on here but Jesus Christ I wish it would come back. <br /><br />@ Godzilla1, if you want decent LSD then I suggest you go to 3Jane, she is a very reputable vendor and has quality product. Shrooms I don&#039;t know much about or the vendors for them but just make sure you read the vendors history carefully and view their stats etc so you can find the most reliable source. I HIGHLY suggest you read the reviews that are available in the Rumor Mill forum and do some research on them. Regarding how to get BTC if you are an American then getting a MoneyPak and going to CoinBox is probably your most fast and easiest route.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would plus fifty you if I could :)

				Using personal experience to justify the readiness of someone else is bullshit.<br /><br />You have to set the limit somewhere and while it&#039;s not fair to everybody, age limit works for most.<br /><br />Why is everybody assuming this kid is 17 ? What if he is 15 ? 14 ? <br /><br />Looking back, I thought I was very fucking smart at 18 but it&#039;s only today that I see how foolish I really was.

				Pot and L by 16.... acid became one of the most important experiences and most profound discoveries of my life. Even over doing it had it&#039;s benefits. <br /><br />Definitely without question, a kid able to get on here, get bits, can do whatever the fuck they want. Dumb fucks are at every age. Immaturity plagues all ages too. As long as said kid buyer doesn&#039;t announce age to selling vendor, I think they know enough to make their own choices. <br /><br />

It&#039;s a chocolate bar, and I&#039;m assuming you live with your parents so if they happened to open this package up you may be able to get away with it unless your Mom&#039;s on her rag and decides to devour the bar herself ... then it&#039;s a bad idea. But his packaging is stealthy and gives no indication that it is anything more than a chocolate bar.<br /><br />LSD, there&#039;s a few vendors still around just make sure you come on the forums and search their name to find their review/feedback thread in the rumor mill section, this will give you a better indication of the quality of both the product and vendor than the feedback will.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about MAC security so can&#039;t help you there.<br /><br />I think SR is a positive thing for minors IMO. They&#039;re going to get drugs anyway, and the people they may have to deal with to do so and the bunk or dangerous product they could receive instead is far more dangerous than selling legit drugs to minors. My teenage years were taking anything I could get a hold of, including meth, because my drugs of choice were not always available or easy to find, but meth and PCP were widely available in my area. If I had the supermarket style choices an SR user has, I would have never done either and actually stuck to drugs that I enjoyed more like shrooms, LSD and E.<br /><br />And don&#039;t even get me started on E, scares me to even think about the stupid shit I ingested in my younger years that I was told was E. To me, this is no different than giving out condoms to kids - you know they&#039;re going to do it, so might as well make it that much safer for them.

				@godzilla1 (and to go back in direction of the topic):<br />if you haven&#039;t got any other psychedelic experiences and want to try shrooms + lsd, i would recommend you (based on my experience as minor) to start with shrooms.<br />if that&#039;s cool for you, try it with lsd. perhaps try to read smth about it before. that has probably been one mistake i&#039;ve done in my childhood, that i often didn&#039;t really know what i was doing.<br />yes it&#039;s fun doing shroom and yes it&#039;s fun doing lsd, but it can turn that suddenly as i have seen and experienced on my own that often. (just see that as an explanation, i don&#039;t want to fear you)<br /><br />perhaps if you got succeeded with your trips, leave a feedback here.<br /><br />@age-related topic:<br />the internet is an (more or less) anonymous place and silkroad is an anonymous marketplace, if godzilla1 says he is below the age of 18 and you won&#039;t sell to him, he&#039;ll set up a new account and order that way.<br />there is no chance to avoid that underage ppl will buy some drugs here on sr.<br />In my opinion, if a human individual feels a need of all that experience taking drugs can give you and is taking all the way here to SR (or to his local friend/dealer/connection), he should probably get the chance to take the experience.<br />As mentioned before it&#039;s his body/mind and even if something bad/unexpected will happen, the human got his experience and (hopefully) learned smth out of this.<br />I can fully understand if dealers won&#039;t sell to minors, i even don&#039;t know if i would. I think i would try to judge the person on its&#039; own, but what the hell gives me the right to judge about him ? I&#039;m not kind of a higher intelligence, just because i have lived some years more than him on this planet. Of course i have more experience and would try to share this with this human, but how to share the feeling of mdma? Ever have tried to describe your first E ?<br />Probably the minor &quot;doesn&#039;t&quot; know what he is doing and i could have avoid him from a bad experience. In my opinion every experience which has not been taken, is a &quot;bad&quot; experience. (besides, before judging me, please try to think a few seconds about bad/good and negative/positive)<br />If you&#039;re 17years +364day you&#039;re a minor and after your party you&#039;re an adult ? Doesn&#039;t make sense to me :)<br />I&#039;m pretty sure not every minor here is just 17, but also i&#039;ve seen kids at the age of 14 which have been more adult than some of people 30+ i know. It&#039;s all to his mind/experience, hard to describe what exactly i mean, but i guess the most of you will get it :)<br /><br />-- one more addition:<br />i did take drugs in my very early years, smoked a lot weed, did e&#039;s, speed, meth and all the other drugs i was able to get.<br />did it damage me? - Yes it did (if you godzilla1 or any1 else want to know, pm me :p )<br />would i like to miss it? - No.<br /><br />edit:<br />Perhaps he&#039;s just a reporter choosing a childish nick and writing an article about &quot;SR selling to minors ?&quot;. We don&#039;t know ;)

				<br />Hi Godzilla, welcome to the show. If you&#039;re here, you&#039;re probably smarter than the average bear so I&#039;ll encourage you use those wits to soak in the forum. This place is an amazing resource for new users and WAY safer than scoring and learning from the street. Your questions can be answered (and cross referenced) here; both academic and anecdotal. I wish I had a resource like this when I was younger, it would have saved me a ton of cash, and near misses.<br /><br />I wish you many years of safe, fun, beneficial use so long as you choose to use.

				To Godzilla...<br /><br />For drug info, dosage, effects, death potential, go to:<br /><br />Erowid.org.<br />&amp;<br />Bluelight.ru<br /><br />Have awesome trip on this Road.&nbsp; Just fucking learn about the shit you do before you dose.&nbsp; That is one thing that pisses me off about the kids I know about here.&nbsp; Shit, that has pissed me off about myself at times. Dosing without knowing.<br /><br />Also, make sure to research your vendor before buying.&nbsp; Shit, I&#039;d suggest you not even get coins for at least two weeks.&nbsp; Just learn how to get them, then find what you want, then find who you want to buy from.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Unless you have money to throw away, stay away from the addictive shit, because thats where the scams are always at.<br /><br />Only shop with the top 15% of vendors and try to stick to vendors who are active on the boards.&nbsp; The vendor who has a great reputation does not want to tarnish it by fucking you over for 50 bucks or whatever.<br /><br />one final note, research chemicals...&nbsp; RESARCH THEM!&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Get a MG scale with fresh batteries or learn to disolve it in a solvent to accurately dose youself.<br /><br />Also, do your parents drink coffee in the morning?&nbsp; huh? huh?&nbsp; see what&nbsp; I&#039;m getting at here?&nbsp; &nbsp;There is some awesome mdma you might be able to slip into their coffee.&nbsp; yeah?&nbsp; sound good?&nbsp; yeah?&nbsp; Rolling with your family might be a bonding experience :)<br /><br /><br />Now, bitinstant works well. Here is how to do it.<br /><br />Go to TORMAIL.ORG&nbsp; Get a fucking email address.&nbsp; fuck clearweb email addresses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take your laptop down to a coffee shop, open up a mt gox account, don&#039;t use TOR to do it. they will flag your account.<br /><br />Set up an account, go to funding, select cash deposit.<br /><br />If you choose bitinstant, it will send it to bitinstant.com<br /><br />enter the amount you want to deposit, mke sure to deposit 10$ more than you need as there are fees.<br /><br />click through the steps, print out the order form, go to the bank, hand them the print out and the money, let them do the work.<br /><br />go back to the coffee shop 5 hours later, get on mt gox, buy bit coins...<br /><br />(fuck, this is a lot of work.&nbsp; Is there an easier way?&quot;<br /><br />transfer them to an online wallet<br /><br />https://www.instawallet.org/<br /><br />Book mark that page it sends you to or you lose your money, <br /><br />Transfer the money from mt gox to it.<br /><br />Go home.<br /><br />check that page until you see the money deposited there, it can take hours, it is scary, but it works.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then transfer it to other online wallets in bits and pieces, or whatever you want to cover yours tracks.<br /><br />then finally send it to your silk road account.<br /><br />go buy some fucking drugs.<br /><br /><br />but first, you need to set up GnuPG to encrypt your data.<br /><br />depends on your OS how that works.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />after you get your shit. have fun, don&#039;t sell unless it&#039;s to your close friends, don&#039;t ever tell anyone you get shit in the mail.&nbsp; Tell them you met some black guy, or white guy, or mexican, or whatever color that you don&#039;t see lots of in your town.<br /><br />:)

				Last time I made a post about this kind of thing I racked up like -5 karma. I&#039;m glad to see the majority are actually sensible about this subject.<br /><br />Because really, if you think whatever arbitrary number your government decided to call the age of consent actually has any basis in reality, you are just as mindless as the individuals who you commonly refer to as &quot;sheeple&quot;<br /><br />I can also vouch for USAshroomz as a good choice for mushrooms, the packaging is extremely clever. If your parents see it, just tell them you ordered chocolates as a gift for a girl or something

				Personally I think kids are gonna get drugs anyway they can, they might as well get them here where they are clean and safer to procure......what I dread in this conversation is the inevitable situation that arises when some rich 15 year old kid buys a significant quantity of coke and then OD&#039;s, and thus it ends up in the media......can you imagine the impassioned pleas within closely cropped video footage of boring suburban house wives on Fox news......Bill O&#039;Reilly would have a field day and the nightly media backlash would be in the extreme!!!....Not good PR for SR.

Oh and don&#039;t underestimate the drugs on this site, most of these drugs are the real deal and aren&#039;t like the low-grade garbage you&#039;re getting from raves, clubs, parties or that guy that stands outside your school every morning, use everything at the correct dosage and with caution. I feel I need to emphasize this because teens love to overdo everything(this MAY or MAY NOT apply to you). Good luck getting what you need. Be Safe. Have fun. Oh and yeah MoneyPaks all the way, don&#039;t go through banks, I don&#039;t trust going through banks to do my business on here, just seems sketchy.

				I understand where people are coming from when they say the age dosnt matter as most of us were taking drugs way before we were 18 however, im sure before we were 18 we had limited access to most drugs. My worry is that a kid of like 16, intending to buy just a lil&#039; bit of weed online may be tempted by an Argos catalog of drugs unfolding in front of him. All of a sudden he wont be introduced to MDMA at say, 17....lsd at 18...and coke at 19 etc...But all of them at 16. Heroin. Coke. Prescription pain killers. It is a worry of mine...

				i first took MDMA when i was like 14, although i dont think i took enough as i cant remmebr feeling anything, plus alot of my friends got into a big fight at a party that night and i ended up smacking a few people so adrenaline probably killed it, and about 4 police riotvans turned up and then it basically become about 20 policemen vs 40 14-20 year olds, ah the joys of London.

				Kids will be kids, but I think if the dude can put the effort to figure out how to get on SilkRoad and fund the account, then he&#039;s probably smart enough to read up on what he&#039;s taking. Maybe not responsible enough but were any of you at that age?

				Shit most people older than 18 aren&#039;t responsible with their drugs, it just doesn&#039;t do as much damage to them uz their body isn&#039;t in the process of growing so I can see where others come from, but its not the age that matters at all in my opinion as far as who is mature enough to handle their drugs, but as far as how much damamge it will do to you it is fact it will hurt you more as a kid than as an adult which is why I feel like kids should be allowed on here so they will damage themself the least. If I had a 12 year old son and he came up to me saying he was gonna try some local ecstasy I would hand him some MDMA off of here, I wouldn&#039;t feel good doing it, but I would rather have a 12 year old take MDMA than piperzine cuz I know if he wants to try it he will find it.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				I will not state my age but will say I am under 18 and have bought from about 10-12 different vendors and have even gained a fake id through all of this, being under 18 is going to give you a disadvantage but honestly just get a friend to get a PO box or beat your parents to your mail (sketchy as fuck, I learned the hard way). Your age should not matter as long as you are experience with what drugs/what you are getting involved in, good luck man, this place is revolutionary.

				Well, it would appear that everyone here has determined if you should or should not do this ;)<br /><br />So, if anyone under the age of 18 wanted to buy something from here, here is how they might do it.... <br />First of all, I&#039;m going to make some assumptions.... You live in the US.A You live with a supervisor that probably won&#039;t approve of this. You have very little technical skill. You probably don&#039;t know an adult willing to help you. And you probably have a fair amount of common sense...<br /><br />Well, you&#039;ve come this far, so lets go ahead and go all the way. First off, you might want to do EVERYTHING on a computer with a disposable Hard Drive. Meaning, if this goes south you can get rid of all proof you had this stuff ordered to your house....<br />The first thing you&#039;ll need is TOR and a BTC wallet. You&#039;ve got the TOR half down, and I&#039;m going to assume you can click through a basic wallet set up and wait a few days for it to sync in with the coin network... (Took me a week, and I&#039;d like to think my network speeds are pretty good.)<br />Now, we&#039;ve got the wallet, and we&#039;ve got TOR. But we can&#039;t really talk to anyone without PGP can we..... So, I&#039;m actually a little fuzzy here as well. (I probably shouldn&#039;t be, as I&#039;ve been a Linux/BSD user for the past several years, and we came up with the stuff. Right?) But I&#039;m sure someone here or on the Internet somewhere can help you set that up... I&#039;ll come back later once I&#039;ve figured it out. (And I remember.)<br />But, now we need bitcoins. And we can&#039;t really set up a bank account, now can we?<br />But luckily here in the modern world, we have WALMART! Walmart you say? How could that possibly help?!<br />We&#039;re going to buy gift cards. I wouldn&#039;t really call them gift cards as much as I would call them prepaid credit cards... Either way, we can get bitcoins with them.<br />So, go to walmart, ask the dummy at the register to get you a prepaid credit card. If they ask why, just tell them its because its safer than cash, or because you want to buy something online. You get the point. They shouldn&#039;t ask you for an ID or any information, it should be just like buying anything else....<br />Once you&#039;ve got that go online and find a place that will exchange that for bitcoins. The place I hear is the best is https://get-bitcoin.com/ They only require an email to get the coins. And you should be able to figure out how to fake that pretty easy....<br />Once we&#039;ve got our coins we send em to the good ol&#039; Silkroad. If you figured out how to make an account, you should be able to figure out how to put your coins in.&nbsp; You should message the dealer you would like to purchase from and see if they will sell to you. They might just want you to FE. DON&#039;T TELL ANYONE ANY MORE ABOUT YOURSELF! We already know you&#039;re under 18, and thats enough to narrow you down by half the universe. And that could be the thing that gets you busted. So be careful what you say...<br />Now, once they accept your coins and mail you your dope, you have to explain to mommy and daddy why there is a package in the mail with your name on it....<br />Tell them its a video game or something.... Explain to them that you ordered it online with that also suspicious card you bought the other day. Tell them to just leave it on your bed and prey they do.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry this is very vague, and didn&#039;t go very in depth on most things, but it should be a starting place....<br />If you&#039;re determined enough you should be able to figure it out. As for whether or not its moral or wise to do this at a young age, I cannot say. I&#039;m not the person to make that judgment. But I figure if you&#039;re determined enough you&#039;re going to get it one way or another, and this is probably one of the safest.....<br /><br />As for this hotspotshield (If thats what you&#039;re talking about....) I would stay away from it. TOR is enough to anonymize you network wise..... As long as you don&#039;t open your mouth too much you should stay that way.<br />And for changing your MAC address... Well, that was dumb. Not dumb in a bad way, but really just dumb. A waste of your time... <br />The way your network is MOST LIKELY set up is all of your devices connected to a router that connects to a modem that puts you online. All you do by changing your MAC address is change the way the router sees you. All of your traffic (Unless ran through TOR, which you are if you&#039;re here.) can still be pin pointed to YOUR IP address. MAC stands for Media Access Control, its the hard ware address used by your NIC(Network Interface Card) to maintain an IP address so the router/switch knows where to send the IP data. <br /><br />So trust me, if a Fed breaks down your door they&#039;re not concerned with your MAC address.... If they knew you went through all that to change it, they would probably laugh at you....<br /><br />And even if that isn&#039;t how your network is set up and maybe this computer connects DIRECTLY to the internet, well, you wouldn&#039;t be connected with a spoofed MAC. Your ISP wouldn&#039;t allow it.<br />I would love to tell you all how I know this and why I&#039;m qualified to give this info, but thats just a little too personal for me&nbsp; ;)<br />You&#039;ll just have to take my word, and probably do a little research of your own. The Internet is a big place. Anything you want to find out should be in there somewhere. Just learn how to use google. <br />(P.S This is my first post here. So go easy on me please.)<br /><br />GOOD LUCK!

				lol, @ stormtrooper. I would have never guessed you were under 18. Good for you! Wish I had this selection of quality when I was younger. <br /><br />I would have preferred to buy on here other than in real life. I had put myself in nasty situations to get some goods. Sometimes of course getting scammed by bunk or cut stuff. <br /><br />I have always researched my stuff at young age before trying (most of the stuff). I did start partying at 15, has not affected me as an adult that I can see. <br /><br />I think if young ones can access this site than they of course access info on each substance. Young ones these days have so much info at their fingertips, way more than I did when I was young. <br />

				Yeah there are lines that have to be drawn though. We know there are kids here, this is quite obvious. We know that they are going to drugs, this is quite obvious. We know that by saying &quot;You shouldn&#039;t be here, you are under 18&quot; isn&#039;t going to deter them, this is quite obvious. Given these point we may as well do what we CAN as a community to facilitate safe procurement and usage (which is actually what we do already but it&#039;s especially important for the younger of us). This is something we CAN help them do. <br /><br />What we CAN&#039;T do is go round to there houses and sit their holding their hands while they drop their first E so there is actually no point in worrying about something that we have no power over to control. If kids are going to be stupid, they are going to be stupid and because we don&#039;t know someones age on here there is no point in considering this. We need to bare in mind that it&#039;s not actually just teenagers that are stupid in the world, plenty of people over 18 are ridiculous human beings as well. I know many an arsehole that is over 18, so many in fact that I could stick them all on a wall and make up a who&#039;s-who of human crap. Also if you look at stats regarding people that OD the vast majority are adults and of those the vast majority are junkies that use hard drugs. Most kids on here are not going to be interested in things like Smack/Crack/Meth/Opiates/Any of the other addictive customers but the small majority that are would have found it on the street anyway because I have never met a smack supplier that has cared about selling to someone under the age of 18. At least here they wont have to be mouth raped by the dealer if they don&#039;t have the funds to maintain their supply if they become addicted. The fact you have to go through the process of getting your BTC and ordering and the receive it goes a long way to regulate use anyway. <br /><br />If some dick&#039;ed kid did buy Smack on here and the OD then they would have done it IRL anyway and it&#039;s not something we should feel bad about. This is not a cold or callous view, I am simply being pragmatic because as I said we have ZERO control in who buys what from us. Worrying about it will get you nowhere because it&#039;s just not going to change the situation at all. <br /><br />

				The harsh truth is that if some kid is dumb enough to go driving on shrooms, that&#039;s just natural selection taking caring of things.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying I want the kid to die.. but I mean, come the fuck on.. Driving on shrooms? That&#039;s stupidity that noone here can prevent. If they didn&#039;t go driving on shrooms they got from SR, they&#039;d probably try and snort a whole G of street cocaine because it was winter time and they couldn&#039;t stop listening to White Christmas. <br /><br />There is no need for your conscience to stress over people like that. It&#039;s not your fault simply because you supplied them with the drugs.<br /><br />Truth is, you can&#039;t tell people anything. It won&#039;t sink in. People have to come to their own conclusions, get their head inside something, and learn it from the inside out. Let them make their own mistakes.<br /><br />And being honest.. how many of us here WEREN&#039;T on some kind of drug when we were younger than 18? I know I was.. and nothing bad ever really happened. And that&#039;s because I wasn&#039;t a fucking moron, even though I made stupid decisions, I never did anything REALLY dumb, and I always researched things first. Anyone who blindly takes a drug without looking into quality/purity/dosage is a fucking CRETIN, and it&#039;s nothing to do with age. This is the age of information, and kids aint that dumb, they&#039;ll do the research alright.<br /><br />And I&#039;ll tell you what, when I was taking illegal drugs, I never felt worse than when I had a terrible hangover, the morning after my 18th birthday. <br /><br />Just set yourself some rules kid, and stick to them. For example these are mine that I set long ago.<br /><br />1. No needles<br />2. Know your source (thankyou SR)<br />3. Research the safety of drug mixtures before doing them<br />4. Research appropriate dosages and how they vary according to route of administration <br />5. Don&#039;t be a fucking idiot, and take responsibility for your actions<br /><br />If you follow those, you&#039;ll be hard pressed to fuck up.<br /><br />And to help you out.. USAshroomz does shroom chocolate bars. If your parents open your post that should get past them. Just make sure they don&#039;t eat any.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s the possibility that a kid wanted a hard (cocaine, heroin, etc.) drug, has no access to it because nobody would sell to him or he has no contact, but then goes on to Silk Road to get it.&nbsp; Or maybe the kid never considered a hard drug until they found Silk Road - (I know for me personally, several of my purchases on here would never have happened, even if I could source it in real life).&nbsp; And then being dumb they overdose and die, a situation that would not have happened without Silk Road.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that scenario has ever been brought up.<br /><br />Though the argument that a kid would still be doing all kinds of drugs without Silk Road has merit, I have seen it way overblown and given too much credit.

				Tbh, I think telling the kid not to do drugs is a bit pointless. He&#039;s here, he&#039;s gonna buy drugs! (And if he&#039;s here, he&#039;s probably already dabbled IRL)<br />I think that the best thing we can do for minors here is offer them advice. Schools, friends, and most parents, have terrible drug information. Instead of horror stories, tell the kid the truth. Weed won&#039;t turn you in to a paranoid schizophrenic instantly, but smoke in moderation if you&#039;re under 18. Plus at 14 you should have far better things to do than smoke weed all day!

				&quot;Re: im under 18, how would i do this?&quot;<br /><br />Don&#039;t. So I agree no one should be helping minors to buy drugs. On that you are on your own. But if you must, only buy from large trusted vendors with many quality reviews, buy yourself a proper scale, and research the substance you intend to take thoroughly, then follow the advice on dosage levels religiously. Many of the products you can buy here can kill you. Not a funny wake up with a bad hangover, and laugh about it with friends kinda way, but a dead permanently in the ground kinda way. <br /><br />Simple fact is anybody under the age of 18 doesn&#039;t know their ass from a hole in the ground. They just don&#039;t realize it. I was in my fourth decade of life before I could almost tell the difference with written instructions.

				Sorry Kappacino, made my post before reading the thread. I repeated your advice. Your rules are similar to mine. Why use needles when there are far better safer delivery systems available. I gave up most illicit drugs years ago because the quality on the street was rubbish, expensive in my city, and frankly I consider most street dealers lowlife gangster scum. Thanks to SR I have a regular quality supply, that I can change up when tolerance kicks in for a certain substance. Since finding SR I have given up alcohol permanently and my life and health are much better. In my opinion minors already have too much access to the one of the most destructive drugs on the planet, alcohol.

				ill say itd pose a moral dilemma for me, the &quot;right&quot; thing to say is that people under 18 shouldnt be taking drugs, but i smoked my first spliff at 14 so id be a hypocrite to say it shouldnt be done. the other thing is this lad wants some drugs, and chances are he will get them, with or without SR, but is it not better that he get it from a trustworthy seller here than a dodgy back alley seller. not sure i could make my mind up on what to say on this one

				I think people are confusing morality with pragmatism here. I don&#039;t think anyone is actually arguing that that drug dealers shouldn&#039;t really sell drugs to minors. I certainly wasn&#039;t when I was making my point and I thought I made that pretty clear. My point is that practically, we can do fuck all about it here so we may as well keep people safe instead of not helping them and watch them fuck themselves over. If you can&#039;t achieve a moral and ideal outcome on something then you have to settle for the pragmatic solution of best fit which is that if you can&#039;t stop kids getting drugs, nest best thing is to keep them safe. <br /><br />You don&#039;t have to be on one side of the argument or the other to see that both arguments are applicable to this situation (or most others), you just have to be realistic when you consider what you can REALISTICALLY do about something. Machiavelli didn&#039;t sell a lot of books for no reason at all lol.
