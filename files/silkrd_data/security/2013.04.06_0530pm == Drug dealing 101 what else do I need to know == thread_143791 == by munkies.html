				So, basically since I discovered SR I could not ignore the potential for making money. The prices on SR, while some users complain are high, for my country, SR is a god send. I can buy drugs like mdma, lsd or even pot and hash on SR and sell them for over twice the price and people would love me because the quality of SR drugs is much better than the quality of street drugs.<br />So obviously as a responsible guy I&#039;ve done my research on the law and individual cases and here&#039;s what I came up with:<br />1.What I&#039;m doing could potentially land me in prison for the next 20 year or even life if some idiot dies after taking an OD of drugs purchased from me. However, for most drugs dealers, getting caught means a suspended sentence, but that usually means they cooperate with the police in some form, which I don&#039;t think I will be doing.<br />2. Most drug dealers in my country are caught after selling large amounts of drugs to undercover investigators or being sniched.<br />3. Most drugs that come in my country originate from Spain and 99% of the time the buyer is acustomed to the seller. Investigators get info from phone taps, so that&#039;s why SR is such a plus. It would be very hard for LE to prove any connection between me and the vendor if they don&#039;t know I&#039;m using SR. Plausible deniability would be on my side.<br />So here&#039;s what I&#039;ll be doing, hopefully I&#039;ll get some advice to improve:<br />1. I get my drugs shipped to a friends address, he&#039;s trustworthy, he knows I&#039;m getting drugs shipped, but he doesn&#039;t know about SR.<br />2. I bought a prepaid sim card and an old phone from a prepaid sim card. I used a fake personal id number to activate an option with free unlimited text messages. I have also programmed an app that can generate valid personal id numbers, so I can activate this option everytime I buy a new sim. I never talk shit on my personal phone.<br />3. I only sell drugs directly to a handful of customers that I know well. They know this shit is good quality and when their friends want some, they pay them up front, they come to me and I give them the shit. When they get asked where they get the shit from I told them to use my nickname. No one of my non-drug using friends know that nickname.<br />4. I keep many friends that don&#039;t use drugs. I don&#039;t even discuss drugs with them, in fact I act like I&#039;m against drug use.<br />5. I do whatever I can not to look like a drug dealer or user. I don&#039;t have any tattoos, I keep away from shady characters, I don&#039;t talk gangsta. In fact I seldomly get high on anything, just a few times a month.<br />6. I know police activity skyrockets after midnight so I will not be selling anything at that time.<br />7. I treat data security as a serious concern, I run liberte in a virtual machine on a thumb drive, I don&#039;t keep any evidence on my computer. The thumb drive is on my keychain, I never keep it more than a few feet away from me in case I need to destroy it.<br />8. I don&#039;t like unneeded attention so I don&#039;t go on spending frenzies, most of the profits will go to my mom and grandma.<br />9. I don&#039;t buy more than I can sell, I don&#039;t need a stash that I have to always think about and that could be used as evidence.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m all set, I used to sell weed for a brief period and made some good money. I think SR is going to make me some really good money, the only thing I could possibly worry about is getting caught. If you have any other tips I would appreciate if you&#039;d share.

				You can deal drugs to a small amount of people for a long time and never get caught. I call this closed-circuit dealing. It&#039;s like having a secret club that nobody knows about and doesn&#039;t allow any new members. Most dealers who get caught are the ones who are concerned with making the most money in the fastest way possible. This means selling to as many people as possible and/or building a network of distribution. The more people involved always means a higher chance of getting caught. <br /><br />The most difficult thing about dealing drugs IRL is where you keep your stash and making sure the way you are dealing doesn&#039;t get you caught. Don&#039;t have people coming and going from your house at all hours of the day. The neighbors will notice and all it takes is one phonecall from a nervous neighbor to get police surveillance. You are smart not to do deals late at night. In fact, never even have anything illegal on you or in your care late at night. Here in California, cops love to pull people over at 2am just to see if they can find anything illegal happening. <br /><br />In California, it&#039;s also a red-flag to have 2 cell phones on you. So make sure to be smart about using your anonymous phone. <br /><br />More important than the size of your customer base is their intelligence. You can have 100 smart customers and never get caught or 20 stupid ones who will get caught themselves and give you up just to try to save their own ass. Make sure you are dealing with people who aren&#039;t going to overdose, act stupid in public, or keep drugs laying around in their car. <br /><br />Good luck!

				The small ones I use on my person are called &quot;Uber-Orbs&quot; - they are shaped almost like a pair of bowling skittles.<br /><br />I fucked up two HTC&#039;s a few years back by accident, when iPhones were a dream in Steve Jobs testicles. Tried it on a third and then realized that I was holding the ultimate portable data destruction device.<br /><br />I also realized I had some explaining to do as to why I&#039;d fucked up a bunch of new corporate phones.

				Interesting. But I would assume data can still be recovered using forensic methods.<br /><br />I read somewhere that you can&#039;t actually erase a hard drive even with a strong magnet. The data will be &#039;distressed&#039; (unreadable by normal means) but it will still be there.<br /><br />I encrypt everything and keep the encryption keys on a floppy disk. Floppies can be burned and then you have 100% certainty that the data is indeed gone.

All you have to do is destroy the chain of custody as far the evidence is concerned, so that the data they capture at the time of arrest or seizure is not the same as the evidence supplied in court.<br /><br />There were some research / legal papers published a few years back saying that it is highly likely that anyone challenging the chain of custody as regarding flash / SSD drives will succeed in court, as the data itself will slowly degrade overtime without intervention. Therefore, it would fail the CRC-type check used, and it would be presentable that the evidence presented in court isn&#039;t the same evidence captured initially.<br /><br />Gonna have to try and find it out.<br /><br />Other things to note from this thread:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=143791.msg983709#msg983709">Quote from: munkies on April 06, 2013, 05:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">7.

You will cause so much damage, they&#039;ll wish you robbed the place.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;If your from the country that starts I and ends with Y, you will almost for certain have a snitch or get caught, they are very very tough especially on mobile phone tapping, hit you with such a sentence thus forcing you to snitch. I will give you some advice later on. I know dealers in a handful countries around europe and none operate in the same, in other words every country has its own strategy. For example, in NL and BE people can talk about bringing tons and killing for instance by way of sms, not by phone call, worst comes to worst that will not hold up in court. In UK sms is deadly, better talk all the shit in the world over the phone then send a message cos they will get you for that. You see what I mean? Every country has its own little methods and tactics.

				In my opinion most of the fear around getting caught electronically are overrated. The resources required for such an investigation are far above the average police departments abilities and would need some kind of special unit to get involved...not impossible but not likely either.&nbsp; The way that you would get caught is to have people talking about you.....the solution? Get your customers to sell for you. Say things like &quot;if you friends want any, YOU come and get it for them&quot; and of course offer them rewards..you might make a little less but well worth it. <br /><br />mm
