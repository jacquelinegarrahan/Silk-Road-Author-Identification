				It will eventually rise again, but it could take a long time.&nbsp; This dip may be all the folks grabbing their coins from SR and cashing out quickly after that hiatus.<br />When I first started here coins were worth $70 or so, then within a week or so they crashed down to a little over $1 each, and hovered around that for months.<br />I think it will hover around $100 for awhile though.

				I joined the road when the exchange rate was 1BTC = $5!<br /><br />I have a colleague who bought &quot;a salary&#039;s worth&quot; of bitcoins when it was around $25 and he suggests keeping it and not spending at all. (he does not know about SR and I don&#039;t think he uses drugs)<br /><br />This guy is a seasoned investor; gold and silver most notably. He says he will keep his bitcoins until it reaches four figures which I think will take a very long time at least but probably impossible.<br /><br />If I had loads of bitcoins, I&#039;d save them and forget about them. Alas, I smoke cannabis and my primary source atm is SR!

				It&#039;s been really annoying!<br /><br />While SR was down, I used the time to stock up on BTC for when the Road would be up and running again. Now SR is (mostly) accessible, the BTC I bought have lost nearly a third of their value. So I&#039;m reluctant to place any orders. I&#039;d rather wait until the coins are worth closer to what I paid for them,.<br /><br />Still, it beats waiting around for hours in a cold and rainy bus shelter for the local coke dealer who, no matter how many times you call him is perpetually &quot;Just round the corner and will be there in 10 minutes&quot;. And when he finally DOES arrive, all he&#039;s got is a gram that weighs 0.7 and is cut with 70% mannitol!

				OP - you want to hold them. They&#039;re on the verge of mainstream. And I mean, REALLY MAINSTREAM. You will regret &quot;cashing them out&quot; in a few weeks/months. The interest is at an all time high. When &quot;Big Money&quot; moves in (they&#039;ve already started), and values go up, and people are talking in mBTC (1000th of a Bitcoin because 1 BTC will be worth $1,000 and more).. you will be pulling your hair out in regret.

				Yeah, if you had a thousand dollars, it&#039;d be good to just buy all that a thousand (about 10 now) would buy and hang on to it. About 3 weeks ago, I spent $3000 when they were $80 each, and it went up to $260+-I should have sold, but figured it would keep going up, I had slightly over $8000 worth. I&#039;m kicking myself now for not selling. However the conditions that led to a sell off are still possible, but I don&#039;t think it will go below much than $100 (could be wrong though!) What happened is that MtGox was hit with a DDOS and people couldn&#039;t log on and that led to panic selling. MtGox has done NOTHING (that I&#039;ve heard) to fix this. They are super anti Silk Road, so it&#039;s&nbsp; unlikely they will put some servers in a TOR network, I think that would keep them from a DDOS (I&#039;m not a tech guy though)<br />I don&#039;t think you will go wrong if you can get BTC for a hundred or less.

				The recent crash will have rocked current and new investors confidence about the short to medium term prospects of bitcoin&#039;s worth, I&#039;d say there is one more correction of the price coming in the next couple of weeks so if you&#039;re looking to buy save some cash and wait for it to drop &gt;$90 again. <br /><br />Mt. goxxed needs to be removed from this Earth if bitcoin is to ever succeed...please excuse my french but I&#039;d love to punch that chubby cunt in his face.

				You guys see the news about Chinese CCTV doing a 1 hour pro Bitcoin special? It&#039;s about to be a frenzy in China. Believe me on that.<br />And they would love to taunt the US Dollar. If it aired on CCTV, Bitcoin got the green light from the Chinese leadership.. which is SERIOUS. I think Bitcoin-QT already was downloaded 7,000x more in 2 days since the special aired then in the last few months alone in China. <br /><br />With there being a bank holiday in Japan.. and no new money coming into Gox till Tuesday. Watch what happens this week. You guys thought $266 was cool? <br /><br />Reminds me of that line in The Social Network - &quot;A million dollars isn&#039;t cool. You know what&#039;s cool? A billion dollars&quot;. If you have BTC, its value is going to start increasing like never before (Not to mention pro BTC comments by CEO&#039;s of Paypal, Western Union, MoneyGram etc). If you don&#039;t have BTC, GET IT while it&#039;s still $116. When it&#039;s double or triple this or quadruple this in a few weeks, you&#039;ll thank me.<br /><br />

				Hmm.. Didn&#039;t know that. But the fact that CCTV was allowed to run a 1 hour pro BTC documentary means that the Chinese Communist Party approved it. They&#039;d NEVER let anything that flouts their strict restrictions to be aired with impunity. Additionally, wouldn&#039;t put it past the Chinese to prop up a currency (virtual or other) that would snub and/or challenge the US dollar.. dont you think? But then the flip side is, China holds a LARGE amount of US dollars. So that might be like cutting off the nose to spite the face? I&#039;m not an economist.. I don&#039;t know. But China nothing airs on CCTV (especially something like Bitcoin) without a greenlight from the government. Interesting indeed.
