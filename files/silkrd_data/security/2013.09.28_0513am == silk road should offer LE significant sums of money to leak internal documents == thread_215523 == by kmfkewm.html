				Offer the police something like $10,000 or $20,000 in BTC if they leak documents about what the police are doing to attack SR. Sort of like that leak from the Australian Federal Police. We need to do everything we can to encourage agents in the police forces to join our side. There are four things we can use to gain this ability. The first is Money, and that is something that is best offered by SR staff. The second is ideology, but that might not help us very much. Most of the police have very different ideologies than we do, and libertarians are not very attracted to the police force in the first place. If we could infiltrate the police with our own agents it would be nice, but it isn&#039;t very realistic. But just in case any of you police out there see the fact that the war on drugs is leading to almost all of the bad things that drug use is blamed on, and you want to help end the war on drugs, helping SR by providing intelligence is a great thing for you to do, and it might even excuse you partially from all of the horrible things you have certainly done by virtue of holding the job that you do. It is never to late to do the right thing, and the sooner you do the right thing the more favorably you will be remembered when you are standing trial for crimes against humanity. The third thing is compromise, if we knew specific agents involved in the SR investigation we could try to get some dirt on them and blackmail them into providing intelligence to us, for example proof that they have cheated on their wives or pictures of them having sex with minors or something. This is not going to be very realistic either, unfortunately, although maybe we can do something, perhaps there is a kid of one of these agents who supports us and has dirt on his father that we can use to blackmail him. The final thing is ego, which is actually a good shot considering the police are treated like shit by their superiors and rarely used to their maximum potential. I am sure there is some smart agent out there tasked with investigating us who has been treated poorly by his bosses and co-workers, and treated like an idiot when in reality he is probably even smarter than they are! Such a person would have motivation to prove his superiority by leaking information to us without his stupid co-workers being able to figure out who is doing the leaking, so we can always hope that there is some smart cop suffering because of the other idiots who wants to finally put the idiots in their place.<br /><br />Finding the names of the officers involved in the investigation would be useful as well, as we could potentially gain access to them via other means as well. Once we know who the specific enemies are, short of DEA as a whole obviously, we can target attacks against them. Another route we need to consider taking is hacking into their computers and spying on them electronically. Obviously the person who wrote the recent article on SR has access to the names of some of these individuals perhaps we could hack them and try to gather the names of the people who shared information with them, or hack those people from the reporters pwnt box.<br /><br />Simply put, I think that SR as an organization and also SR as a community need to start thinking of ways that we can gather intelligence. Right now we are doing pretty well on the counter intelligence front, protecting our own secrets. But counter intelligence is only half of the game, and right now we are lacking on the intelligence front, despite some significant victories (such as the leaking of the Australian Federal Police report on SR).

				If there&#039;s a decent enough bribe, and the media picks it up for wide reporting, there will be low level paper pushers inside the offices of Customs, LE/ DEA that will take advantage of it guaranteed.

				you can be damn sure they&#039;ve already infiltrated us. i always wonder who it is on these forums and on the site, who is it that&#039;s contributing great info and chat, just like everyone else on the surface... behind the handle is a fucking office ful of feds/dea/interpol/whatever 3 letter bunch of LE you want to possibly name... hell, i&#039;d say there&#039;s 50+ active agents contributing to these forums. let&#039;s be realistic. that is their main way of gathering intel.<br />hi guys!<br />love to you too, fuckers! :)<br />maybe one day you will understand and share our point of view (and im sure some of you already do!)<br />xx

				Start sending them free LSD (or DMT/other psychedelics) from here, even one agent who trips and has an eye-opening revelation about the truth will spread the word and love to others who may be poised to do the same thing. Other drugs-of choice could be used obviously, but i believe psychedelics serve a purpose that&#039;s two fold.<br /><br />I will definitely contribute to a fund (if it was setup/endorsed by DPR or another respected longterm member) for LE bribery/blackmail fund. This could potentially be funded solely by donations or a small percent of the SR tax would go to this fund, or both. Needless to say this wallet would have to run by an extremely trustworthy person.<br /><br />Offer LE the bribes first and then warn that blackmail comes next. Any half logical person would at least accept the anon BTC bribe before being blackmailed into doing what we want for free...<br /><br />There are most certainly individuals in LE who are future freedom-lovers and who, if given the right opportunity, would join our cause.<br /><br />WE have the best hackers in the world here in the deepweb!!!!! WE need to use them! Whether they do it out of a sense of duty or we pay them with funds collected via donations (or SR taxes).<br /><br />Something like this may also lead to a greater notoriety, for example, anti-government groups (who are also anti-drug) may now be attracted to this. Which only spreads the word and gets our Bigger picture message out there. <br /><br />Funds used could also help directly with publicity. For example putting out anonymous paid private ads on clearnet. IK this is kind of what ATL attempted but SR has so many more members around clearnet that i think advertising would actually pay off. For example a pop-up on a major website that just say &quot;silkroad marketplace: google it&quot; if even a small % of people who saw that ad eventually became SR members i think it would be a huge increase, not to mention how that would spread by word-of-mouth....<br /><br /><br />TL,DR&nbsp; kmfkewm, yet another great post and ya read my mind with some of these ideas!!! I hope enough members support this and this comes to fruition. This would be an extremely useful tool in combating LE and in doing so preserving SR (which is pretty much the main goal) <br /><br />The more people on SR the bigger the TOr network and SR community becomes!!!! LE is losing and we can&#039;t let up now!!<br /><br />Keep the fight up<br />Peace &amp; Love

				The fund could be set up like an indegogo campaign, where those of us with the extra resources could pledge money into an escrow account which is released to the leaker. Alternatively, there could be an intel tax here on all dealers which gets set aside like I just described. <br /><br />As far as compromising agents goes, I&#039;m sure there are people here clever enough to stick CP images on an agent&#039;s computer. It&#039;s an unethical strategy, reminiscent of the strategy of those who lie to judges in &quot;parallel reconstruction&quot; of drug cases against American citizens in plain violation of the 4th amendment. You can sleep well knowing that you&#039;re retaliating against a sociopathic tyrant who has no respect for the constitution which was the only legal thing that &quot;legitimized&quot; his use of state power in the first place. <br /><br />To those of us who are ideologically committed to the end of the drug war itself, there are many ways you could launch a propaganda campaign from the darknet against the DEA that could cause them long-term harm. You could attempt to erode their moral authority by funding a mini-scholarship program, offering BTC to articulate individuals who write well and need money, like university students, to write hit-pieces against the DEA. Maybe it could be a monthly essay contest. The pieces could be offered as op-ed or submitted to major news aggregators without party-line gatekeepers (thank you internet), like buzzfeed etc. rather than major newspapers. Film students could be rewarded for making videos highlighting DEA 4th amendment and other abuses against citizens.<br />

				We could also create a honeypot clearnet site and tip off the DEA to it&#039;s existence, claiming it is run by SR &quot;inner circle&quot;. Hopefully the case manager takes a look. Internet Explorer and Firefox 0day is not that expensive.
