				I know he has already been under suspension before on Silk Road. Then he listed a bunch of really cheap, highly in demand things at really low prices. Then he made you finalize early. OXY, Valium, Vicodin, etc....<br />Now he has no listings and is gone. POOF.<br /><br />Here is the last email I got from him 4 days ago. Now all his listings are gone along with my money. I&#039;m offering $50 BTC for anyone who can get me this assholes info. He got me for about $500 and I&#039;m going to fucking have him killed.<br />Notice in the email he says he runs the DCN, but doesnt send it to me.

We have run the DCN and it shows still pending delivery. Does not make sense to us either. We are not going to ship to this address again but we are going give you a 100% refund. If and when the product shows up, I am assuming it will eventually, call it a gift from us, no need to remit payment. Lets give it today, I will run your DCN in the morning, if still not delivered we will send you btc direct to your account in the amount of $300 USD.<br /><br />Again, sorry I cannot wave a magic wand and put the meds in your hand immediately, I truly wish I could, but in the event the product still does not arrive today you will have a full refund in your account tomorrow.<br /><br />Star

				being scammed sucks, i think the day it happens to me i will lose a lot of motivation :(&nbsp; But there is a reason not to finalize early.&nbsp; Nobody can make you do that.&nbsp; If someone was trying, let the staff know and get your money back before you release it to him.&nbsp; It is 500$ it could be way worse.&nbsp; Count it as a loss and a learning experience and move on.&nbsp; Saying your going to hunt someone down and kill them over a 500$ debt isnt realistic.&nbsp; If someone can hunt him down, they can hunt us all down&nbsp; :-\ there is a reason it says not to finalize early in the orders page, because you dont press that button until you have what you wanted

				Ok, the vendors are going to hate me for this but...<br /><br />In addition to the fee to become a seller, I think sellers should have to deposit a refundable deposit.&nbsp; Sort of like renters have to sometimes pay a security fee in case there is damage.&nbsp; Imagine if a seller had a $500.00 security deposit that he would lose if there were evidence that he was a scammer.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW, what do you mean &quot;he made me finalize early&quot;&nbsp; did you know this before you placed the order or after you placed the order?&nbsp; I would think that if a vendor wrote to any of us saying that we had to finalize before he would ship that I would write the support of SR and demand that my order be cancelled and the vendor at least warned.<br /><br />It is amazing to me that on the reviews page that 7 out of the last 10 reviews I read (last night) said finalizing early.&nbsp; 70% of the orders were finalizing early.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; <br />The only time i have finalized early was for small small orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t most of these scams be prevented by the buyers refusing to finalize early?<br /><br />

				So you want to have him killed because you trusted a guy you knew the SR saw as shady, and you finalized early for $500? Sounds like something has already been killed in this matter... your common sense.<br /><br />Imo you should thank the guy. He taught you a valuable lesson, do not finalize early with such large amounts of money...

				i finalized early on a $1200 order...&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; lol i want a pair of these glasses! id do the same in your situation... however i think there should be a procedure for validating all truths and if it was so then someone in SR staff alone could sell the address to you... but if vendors start selling info to the highest bidder then LE wont have to buy drugs to find clues... just spend our tax money to find out who we are... every spec of this topic needs to be removed... if you got taken for that i hope you find and beat his ass... if anyone sells you his address they need to be banned...

				I think I speak for all of this assholes victims when I say FUCK YOU to all of you non-helpers. <br /><br />I was looking for help, not critics. Everyone seems to be a critic on the internet. Where they can HIDE and say fuckk youuuo go killl yourselfffff, with tears in their eyes.<br /><br />Thats what was so nice about face/face. <br /><br />Take it from someone who knows. Not one of you sniveling little weasels would say anything to me but &quot;How can we help you Mr Schrady&quot; if we met in person.<br />That, I fucking guarantee.<br /><br />But until I fly around the US and start fucking you lil weasels up. oh well.<br /><br />My biggest concern is that this asshole be stopped. How do we make sure he gets stopped?<br /><br />&quot;If you can&#039;t help, you lil fucking trolls, dont reply&quot;<br /><br />

				I really wanted to embed an image of Rick Ross with a huge cigar in his mouth after reading that last post.<br /><br />IMA IMA BOSS <br />GET PAID TO STUDY THE DRUG TRADE <br />AND TALK WITH THIS MARKETABLE VOICE<br />THATS RICKY ROSSAY<br />UUUUUHHHH<br /><br />Not a fan, but I always picture him for some reason whenever people try to act &quot;boss&quot;.<br /><br />Anyway, scammers suck. I&#039;d never finalize early unless I was ordering something really cheap or had lots of transactions with the vendor. There is very little you can do at this point, but I do hope that your issue somehow gets resolved. People need to realize that they&#039;d make more $$$ being legit vendors than scammers, unless of course they&#039;re just some pissant kids with no connects that only have the capability to steal anyway. There has to be a way to screen for people like that, as distrust is more dangerous to SR than the direct threat of getting busted IMO.
