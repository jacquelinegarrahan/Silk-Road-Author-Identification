				I got an old computer that I put lunbuntu (lightweight Ubuntu) on. I have another NIC card I could put in. I fool with computers but I&#039;m not a tech guy. Would a proxy computer than went between my usual computer and the internet (and router) be a security help? Any body got a URL or something on how to do it? <br />The &#039;new&#039; old computer is &#039;sterile&#039; now, no names on it or anything.

It would prevent the possibility of your real IP address being leaked, since your computer will only have the proxy IP. And it will make it impossible for non-proxy connections to be made. I don&#039;t think this would be terribly difficult to do.<br /><br />In terms of a guide, I remember finding this when I was looking for something else once https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/tun2socks<br />If you wanted to connect to tor on your proxy computer, you could look at the &#039;Using with Tor&#039; section. It&#039;s talking about using a virtual machine, but you could simple adapt it so it instead uses another connected computer, this shouldn&#039;t be too difficult.

				lokiju, what you are describing is called an anonymizing middle box, and it&#039;s pretty much the safest setup you can have, because even if someone / malware roots your main computer, they would not be able to find your IP address.<br /><br />Here is some info on how to do it.<br /><br />https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy#AnonymizingMiddlebox<br />
