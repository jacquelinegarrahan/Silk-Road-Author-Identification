				The other day I made 3 orders, spending my highest amount on SR in one go so far (still only a tiny amount compared to what most of you have probably spent in a day before; but it was roughly 14btc)<br /><br />But being pretty tight for cash right now, I decided not to tumble my coins after buying them, after doing a quick calculation and realising doing so for that amount of btc would be spending up to a whopping Â£4(ish) just to tumble them!! (...yes, I can be that stingy) (calculation based on the max fee of 3% on bitcoin fog)<br /><br />So I just sent them straight from my &quot;Multibit&quot; wallet (on my PC! :o ) to SR.<br /><br />When I first started out (only a couple of months ago...) - I sent my coins through 2 tumbling services. But I dunno... that just seems too excessive now. I can understand going to extreme lengths if you&#039;re a dealer purchasing multiple key&#039;s of coke etc. - but what cop is going to go to the efforts of tracing us small-time buyers?<br /><br />The only way they&#039;d know to start that investigation in the first place (correct me if I&#039;m wrong, which I probably am) would be if they had control of SR, or a vendors account, so that they could see the transaction took place, and then back-track from there. But they don&#039;t (I hope).<br /><br />All that would&#039;ve popped up in the public blockchain would be... just another of the thousands of bitcoin transactions from one random address to another that day. It&#039;s not like it pops up on blockchain.info saying &quot;X amount of BTC sent from address Y to a user account on Silk Road!&quot; is it?<br /><br />Nothing went wrong. No cops have knocked on my door...<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m gonna do from now on. Although I do realise how much of a bad habit it could be to fall into a false sense of security.<br /><br />But yeah... I just wondered, how many of you guys either always, or have once or twice in the past, sent bitcoins to your SR account without sending them through a tumbling service first?

				I&#039;m a new buyer, but don&#039;t tumble my coins. I don&#039;t see how paying for BTC&nbsp; &nbsp;face to face (or cash in the post) with someone reliable, could be linked back to you on SR, so I started doing this with local BTC sellers in my area. Mostly opt for sending out cash though. I use localbitcoins, and change accounts each time, which results in a new address for the coins to land in. I also try and avoid buying off the same person each time, and I change my SR address after every transfer . Not sure if that&#039;s of much use though.

				I never have and I&#039;ve placed 7 orders. I feel if I&#039;m going to get caught it isn&#039;t because I didn&#039;t tumble my coins. Besides, SR tumbles them for me. I really don&#039;t know how I could get caught going with legit vendors and my real name and address. I&#039;ve been ordering packages for years and years and all of them have shown up.

				After doing some research I don&#039;t feel it&#039;s needed. The only precaution I take is that I don&#039;t send my Bitcoins straight into SR (but that&#039;s standard issue for most users anyway); even if it wasn&#039;t a safety issue, of which I&#039;m not concerned about since I purchase anonymously, it&#039;s not wise to have tons of spare coins sitting in the Road. <br /><br />If I wasn&#039;t a small fish I might think differently and use an outside tumbler, but I&#039;m not, so I don&#039;t. SR tumbles - medium heat, I believe (for the permanent press stuff).

No LE are looking to bust small buyers (unless you hand it to them on a silver platter &amp; live in my country that will spend hours of manpower doing paperwork for a stubbed-out joint). On the street, sure, because they can try and work their way up the chain of command. As long as you don&#039;t know much about your vendor and don&#039;t buy really large quantities meant for distribution or manufacturing then we (as in us small-timers) don&#039;t need to be paranoid, just always vigilant (alluding to your &#039;not falling into a false sense of security&#039; bit).

				I think that you should at least send them through a free temporary wallet like InstaWallet.org before sending them to SR. In that case, if you were asked about them at least you could tell LE that you sent the coins to pay for a legit purchase or a personal debt and you don&#039;t know what the other party did with them next. It also depends how you purchased the coins (like if you did it anonymously). Since you said that you store them on your computer, I would hope that you would be taking precautions to keep that location secret (like running TOR on that computer whenever you run the wallet software).

				Bitinstant with fake id and a tormail email account straight to SR bc address. No problems at all and pretty foolproof!

				they do tumble your coins...<br /><br />read the account information and the faq they have. its nice to have all the information to make an informed decision about how u conduct your business getting sloppy and thinking its all gonna be fine is a noble thought and works most of the time but knowledge is power. I hate reading about thats good reading.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus dont think they are not looking at u cause u are not a &quot;BIG&quot; player. If u got money well its good to get that guy into the system cause its gonna cost and they need to keep the wheels of it all WELL oiled. so SMALL PLAYERS keep the day to day running with their money the big payers are all well connected and pay who need to be paid until they get to big then lets pop them and the public is happy. So small players think about that next time u think u are above the laws long arm of let me reach in your pockets and get some of the money u got we go to pay for our jobs. <br /><br />;)
