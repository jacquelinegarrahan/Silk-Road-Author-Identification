				So I&#039;m pretty new to SR and Bitcoin alike. I am ready to make my first purchase(have been lurking SR forums for a little over 6 months). I just have a few questions that I couldn&#039;t find while searching the forums or looking on the web. FYI, I Just got set up with Liberte on a USB flash drive, and it&#039;s awesome so far.<br /><br />Liberte question - Is everything I download on here also going to be secure? So I don&#039;t have to be all sketched out like I was when I was using windows..<br /><br />Back on topic, Is going through https://get-bitcoin.com/ safe at all? I was planning on doing the pre-paid debit card method(there is a 3% surcharge). But I see I can do money order at Wal-Mart, which also I might do.<br /><br />Anybody have any experience and/or know if they are trustworthy? Thanks heaps members of SR.<br /><br />I would also like somebody to critique my method (that is, if they are trustworthy). <br />I was going to buy the Pre-paid card with cash, probably at Wal-Mart. I may have to register it to use it online, if so, I would use a fake name/address etc. (done through Tor?)<br />Put an instantwallet address into the site and do the deal. Then transfer it through a few more instawallets.<br />Then deposit it into my silkroad account. Then basically buy what I want.<br /><br />Is there any flaws in that way of obtaining BTC? Thanks again.&nbsp; :)

				I used get-bitcoin twice a while ago, and have no complaints. The amounts were fairly small, so I actually just mailed cash. A money order is probably smarter, though again I didn&#039;t have any problem. I don&#039;t see any reason to go the pre-paid card route. They&#039;re great for other kinds of anonymous use online, but since you have to actually mail it anyway in this case, it seems like a waste of money. If you do get a card, make sure it&#039;s the non-reloading kind, they won&#039;t ask your name or anything. The re-loadable ones are almost like a bank account so they want all kinds of info.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see any glaring flaws in this plan, but I&#039;m not a huge Bitcoin expert so others may have refinements to suggest.

				Hmmm, now that I am really thinking about it, I will most likely do the bitinstant method and go with Wal-Mart/7-11 cash deposit instead.. I wasn&#039;t thinking about having to mail it to them&nbsp; ;D, I&#039;d much rather have my BTC tomorrow. How un-safe is it to go directly into your SR wallet with bitinstant? It doesn&#039;t seem very safe to go through MT. Gox, considering I don&#039;t have access to a computer that isn&#039;t in my possession.
