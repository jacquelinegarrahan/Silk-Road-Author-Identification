				Is there any other way I can get large amounts of bitcoins? The bank tellers know me too well since it is a small town. Going in to the bank with $2000+ in 20&#039;s is getting very sketchy. I don&#039;t know what to do! I guess I could deposit smaller amounts every now and then but that seems sketchy just the same...

				Western Union (though risky/need ID)<br />Buy a lot of Moneypaks and trade them on bitcointalk.org or #bitcoin-otc IRC<br />Mail cash to somebody trusted, or even better get a money order and send it to them.<br /><br />Send an exchanger you trust a reloadable prepaid debit card. Whenever you want to buy bitcoins just reload the card and they cash out.<br /><br />Nothing at all risky with BUYING bitcoins. You could be buying stocks and bonds on GLBSE or MPEX or just speculating and trading.

				I appreciate the quick response.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done too much research in moneypaks, perhaps I&#039;ll start there... Thanks for the advice.

				Moneypak is expensive though, like 8%+ fee to cash out. Plus you must keep the receipt often the buyer will need them scanned.<br />Mailing money orders is the safest most anonymous way. Or well concealed cash with tracking and sig.<br />

				Ah, that is lame. Money orders do sound nice, I just don&#039;t know if many vendors would be down for that..

				Check the bitcoin wiki fixed trade exchangers<br />Lot&#039;s of them take money orders and cash in mail.<br /><br />You can probably find somebody local to take cash in hand and give you bitcoins. Get an account on bitcointalk.org.. and register yourself on #bitcoin-otc IRC channel.. then you get solid web of trust ratings for every good transaction you do.<br /><br />Lot&#039;s of people do Bank of America direct account transfer on bitcointalk as well. <br />

				Damn, that&#039;s more like it. Thanks for educating me. hahah<br />I would really like to find someone I can hand the cash to to receive coins. That would really put my mind at ease.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely take a look into the IRC channel and site in the morning. Thanks again.

				Have you taken a look at campbx.com at all? They take USPS money order/check and you can get bitcoins that way. There isn&#039;t much volume on that site but i had no problem with a decent sized order and getting coins. You might run into AML/KYC stuff if you deposit too much but at least it is another option to get some coins and spread the trail out a bit.

				Switch to a credit union! Also, if the bank tellers are getting to know you, why don&#039;t you just drop the cash in an ATM?

				The ATM at my bank lets me deposit cash. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen the tellers. I realize this may not be true everywhere.

My town is like 5 years behind the times of everywhere in America, so I won&#039;t be seeing those anytime soon.<br />I can&#039;t imagine depositing all those 20&#039;s. I&#039; assume it acts like a vending machine. It would take like 20 minutes just to deposit all of them hahah.
