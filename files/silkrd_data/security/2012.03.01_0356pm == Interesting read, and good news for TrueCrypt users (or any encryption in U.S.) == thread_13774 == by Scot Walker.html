				Some heavy shit- lots of conflicting opinions as to the widespread implications as well. <br /><br />For small time buyers and even your average vendor, thought, I&#039;d think this is definitely a great sign.

It&#039;s clearly a violation of the 5th amendment to be forced to give up a password that may lead to you incriminating yourself!

				Love it.<br /><br />Just goes to show how essential it is to use TrueCrypt for anything and everything you do.<br /><br />Hope this dosn&#039;t attract too much attention though, or laws may change.

				Awesome news, just make sure you don&#039;t rely on FDE alone to protect sensitive data. As long as your OS is running, the master key for the volume can easily be extracted from RAM. Treat the FDE volume as a regular OS and wipe your tracks; store private files in regular tc file containers and dismount them whenever you leave the computer. <br /><br />Better yet, take out all mass storage and boot from a CD if you want to leave behind nothing at all. Even if LE manages to somehow exploit your install, they can&#039;t plant a persistent bug on your machine. Also, make sure you can&#039;t be ambushed while using the secret OS. Run a laptop off the battery and lock yourself in an interior room away from windows if you&#039;re really paranoid. Quickly take the battery out if your door is broken down, or even if you hear an unexpected doorbell ring, phone call etc trying to get you away from the computer.

				If you&#039;re ordered by a court to provide a password what can they do if you say you forgot it?

				hold you in contempt of court is my understanding...<br /><br />which i&#039;d much rather be charged with than revealing the contents of the encrypted volumes of many here, lol...
