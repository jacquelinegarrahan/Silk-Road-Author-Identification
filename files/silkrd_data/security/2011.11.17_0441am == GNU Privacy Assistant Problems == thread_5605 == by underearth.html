				I am new to the community here but I&#039;m starting to see this is really something very special and unique. <br /><br />If anybody has any experience with running the GPA or GNU Privacy Assistant to encrypt and decrypt I would appreciate your help.<br /><br />When I try to decrypt a message I am constantly getting this error message:<br />&quot;The GPGME library returned an unexpected error. The error was: General error&nbsp; &nbsp;This is probably a bug in GPA. GPA will now try to recover from this error.&quot;<br /><br />Obviously closing the program and trying again does not work. Is there a setting that I am unaware of that will allow me to use the software without these error messages???<br /><br />There have been some great tutorials listed on this community forum which have helped me grasp other issues, but I cannot find anything to explain the problem that I&#039;m having now. I would be very grateful if someone could help me out with this. <br /><br />Thanks again.

				I followed this tutorial pretty much exactly. There was a step that wasn&#039;t included though... a part about &quot;root certificates.&quot; Is this something necessary to do what I want to do with GPA? <br /><br />Otherwise, I consider myself pretty computer savvy but I&#039;m not sure what you mean about a terminal window or how to get there. Any chance I can get you to describe this process in a little more detail for me? Can I use this method to decrypt and encrypt messages??? <br /><br />THANKS!!
