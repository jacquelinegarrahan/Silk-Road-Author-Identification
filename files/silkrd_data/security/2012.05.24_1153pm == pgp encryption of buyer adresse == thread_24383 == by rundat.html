				Gi. I read the wiki on pgo. it mentions/recommends using pgp encryption of the buyer adress. But i 1) can figure out how that would work?<br />2) couldent find any how to in the wiki.<br /><br />Wouldent using tornote be fairly safe. I mean by linking to a tornote in the buyer addr.field message with buyer adresse in it. that self destructs after seller se it?

				keep researching bro you&#039;ll figure it out. PGP is confusing at first but after you get the hang of it, it becomes easy as hell. There are some youtube vids on how to use it

				It is pretty simple and well worth the time to learn. Using PGP protects you in case silkroads servers are compromised. Once you get PGP set up you need to add the &#039;public key&#039; of the vendor you want to order from to your keyring, its usually posted on their vendor page. Then you use that key to encrypt your address or other sensitive information and cut and paste it into the address box on the order form.&nbsp; If Silkroads servers are being monitored or are seized, presumably that encrypted information will not be accessible to LE.

				Here&#039;s the part that had me confused (I&#039;m simple minded anyway) for a while.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t a step-by-step how-to, it&#039;s just the part of the concept that eluded me for quite a while. Hope it helps...<br /><br />When you install your encryption software you now have a tool to wrap your message within the sellers public key which is posted on the seller&#039;s profile on SR.<br />Copy the sellers public key and import it into your encryption software, then write your message then click encrypt. <br /><br />Notice the sellers public key says public key in the header. <br />Notice that your encrypted message says message in the header. <br /><br />Then you just paste your encrypted message into the order box on SR. The seller will unwrap your message using his public and private key in the sellers encryption software.<br /><br />

				PGP works in that you have what&#039;s called a Key, and a password that corresponds to that key.<br /><br />Messages are then encrypted using an individual key, and messages encoded with that key can only be unlocked with the corresponding password.<br /><br />So say a vendor wants your address in pgp, you get their key, import it into gpg (there is a pictorial guide here on the forums), then enter your address onto the clipboard, and encrypt it using the vendors key. Then you send the vendor the encrypted text and they decrypt it with their password.
