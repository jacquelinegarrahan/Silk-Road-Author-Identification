			<dd class="postbody">
				As someone who re-sells gear from SR to friends in my area (I live in the US), I am always looking for better ways to hide my stash and reduce my risk.&nbsp; I currently have a decent hiding space but since I don&#039;t have a vacuum sealer (yet) I feel like if the cops ever busted in my door there&#039;s a significant chance a K9 trained to sniff out drugs could find my hiding place (I usually only have MDMA).<br /><br />Has anyone here ever considered burying (maybe under 6-12 inches of dirt) their stash underground?&nbsp; Like in a backyard or plant pot?&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t have a house I am seriously considering buying a decently-sized pot and throwing some soil in it and keeping my stash (which normally doesn&#039;t take up more than 3&quot;x3&quot;x3&quot; of space anyway) buried a few inches under the surface of the soil.<br /><br />What is your guys&#039; opinion on this?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard K9&#039;s are generally unreliable but all it takes is one decently-trained dog to sniff out your typical hiding places.&nbsp; If my MDMA is only in a couple of ziplock bags (and within capsules) will a K9 be able to sniff it out even if it&#039;s under a few inches of soil?&nbsp; Would love any opinions on this.

				Another question might be whether there are certain plants that tend to deter dogs, and whether or not a drug-sniffing K9 will have been trained to power through repellent odors.

				The drug dog bit has a lot to do with how much residual particulate is on the outside of your packaging. If you are using multi layers of protection, as well as cleaning the outside container with alcohol, and then burying it you will probably be ok. But that has to do more with the packaging then the burying.<br /><br />My dog has dug up all kinds of random shit that he smelled a foot or more down. So if it stinks like drugs the dog is trained for, I don&#039;t think the dirt will matter

				No, absolutely not. The police will turn up the pot in a drug bust. Bury it in the backyard. Or a forest. Somewhere nobody goes. Triple, quadruple, or even more, bag it, place it in a tupperware to keep all possibl humidty and moisture out, and bury it.<br /><br />Do NOT store it in a plant, and ESPECIALLY DO NOT store it in a plant that deters dogs. That makes it VERY obvious. Be safe and all will be well.<br /><br />God luck to you!

				I remember Barry Cooper, the former police officer turned drug law reformer, in one of his videos, I think it was Never Get Busted Volume 1 said that a dogs sense of smell isn&#039;t as effective when the thing it is searching for is placed high up, the higher the better.

They search the chimneys, and I&#039;d assume the roof as well. But it depends on what they&#039;re searching for. If you&#039;re some drug tsar like DPR, they&#039;re searching even square millimeter of your place.<br /><br />If it&#039;s a simple 10g marijuana drug bust, there&#039;s no way they&#039;re going up there.

				By the time they have the dog at your place you are likely fucked already.<br /><br />And keeping the drugs anywhere in your place at all will lead to the dog finding them in a proper search.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dirt doesn&#039;t matter to the dogs.&nbsp; Can you taste the sauce on your pizza through the layer of cheese?&nbsp; The smell of drugs under a layer of dirt is more obvious to a dog.

				Burying in a forest is good because it&#039;s not in your possession or on your land. Just don&#039;t put it in a tin box or anything metal that would set off a metal detector. <br /><br />As for the trees method, it&#039;s interesting but sounds difficult. Birds could get at it, a storm could destroy it, it could be visible from the ground. I think burying far away from your home is the best. Bring a bird watching book with you and a set of binoculars for a good alibi in case someone catches you prodding around alone.

				Buy a large vacuum flask and place your gear inside it, if you have powders make sure they are dry (if your storing for years) and vac-seal them first before placing them in the flask.<br /><br />Put the first cap on the flask and wrap several layers of tape around it (use tape designed for PVC pipes, you can find it at any hardware store), then put the large cap on and wrap another few layers of tape around it.<br /><br />This is completely waterproof and will be good for 20years+ when buried, and the larger vacuum flasks can hold 1KG of powder and quite a lot of cash, most other methods will eventually leak, I lost about 250grams of MDPV because I tried to store it vacuum-sealed in a lunch box wrapped in plastic bags once, after more than a year the water penetrated all the way through to the powder :(<br /><br />Make sure you bury your gear in a national park in a spot you have GPS co-ordinates for and can find again no matter how long it&#039;s been. Be careful to check local fire maps so you don&#039;t accidentally pick a spot that gets burned every few years by the fire department to prevent bush fires, this is very common in Australia, and bury it near the base of several large trees where it wont get moved by extremely heavy rain. You want to obviously chose somewhere that no-one will ever go, where you could scream at the top of your lungs and still be undisturbed.

				Well, this sucks.&nbsp; I&#039;m a seller and I&#039;m thinking more for short-term stashing.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the middle of a city with very little &quot;land&quot; to work with.&nbsp; IMHO if I were to stash a medium-sized amount somewhere relatively far away then I become vulnerable while transporting it away from that area (eg stash spot to my apartment or to a customer).&nbsp; I feel like I&#039;m much more likely to have an encounter with LE while in public or at least in my car (eg tickets, accidents, other random stops).<br /><br />I&#039;m in an apartment right now and it sounds like at least getting a house would be a start.&nbsp; If I do that I probably won&#039;t change the address on my driver&#039;s license.&nbsp; That way if someone snitches then hopefully the address linked to my name would be incorrect.<br /><br />Note to self: get a house with a decently sized yard or that&#039;s near a park.&nbsp; Looks like I better keep selling right now LOL

				I think your main concern should not be how to best hide shit in the event that you get raided, but rather How do you avoid having your place where your stash is located raided in the first place......<br /><br />Don&#039;t do your business there.&nbsp; Only use it for regular friends/family and anything for business meet at someone elses place or out in public with people you know.&nbsp; The only people that should even know where your gear is should be you and potentially anyone else you have living with you for their own safety.<br /><br />As far as everyone else is concerned, you don&#039;t actually HAVE anything.&nbsp; You just know a guy you gotta go meet up with first and then you can hook the others up.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are concerned about your current place being raided, there are things you are doing which are increasing this likelihood.&nbsp; Determine what those are and find better ways to do them that don&#039;t point back to your stash.<br /><br />Once you reach that level, then it doesn&#039;t really matter the EXTRA lengths you go trough to conceal it within your no-longer suspicious location.

				Aussie Mitch&#039;s vacuum flask idea works great. I&#039;ve never kept anything buried that long, but I have found Thermos caches that were 10+ years old with dog treats inside... that the dog did not find. :)&nbsp; I have used the same basic idea for storage for 5+ years, though, and had the contents remain completely intact. The metal ones will hold up to weather and UV.<br />If you are handy, his conduit/pipe idea can be adapted a bit for apartment use. I&#039;m guessing they are not going to rip out walls and infrastructure if a dog doesn&#039;t alert. Pipe can look like it&#039;s going somewhere, it doesn&#039;t have to go somewhere. It just has to be connected to two points. Sewage line and electrical conduit are things most people don&#039;t want to fuck with. [If you do run electrical conduit, I&#039;d run an actual cord through it, so a sniffer will show it as &#039;live.&#039;] Most apartments have some access hatches. <br />For burying, doskocil or pelican boat-type cases will contain scent - if you can dive with it, it&#039;s a good bet. <br />Sealed glass jar&nbsp; should contain anything you want, odorwise.&nbsp; Glass will hold up well to being buried and to groundwater and to weird pH conditions; the straight jars with the black lids, for example.&nbsp; Less easy to transport than the vacuum flasks, and sometimes harder to secure because of the risk of breakage, but do not forget that this is an option.&nbsp; Glass jars get overlooked a lot. There are a lot of ways to camouflage things inside glass jars in plain sight, and sealing bands can be had inexpensively by the 100-pack and only require a hairdryer to put on, and then to put on again.<br />Edit much later to add: caution re: your lids.<br />I trust glass lids. &quot;Plastic&quot; lid is a generic term, permeability can vary hugely.<br />Glass fliptop rubber-sealed jars are reliable.&nbsp; Canning jars are not.<br />&nbsp;<br />Check out geocaching and geocache blogs if you are not already familiar, you might see some good ideas in there. I spent an hour wandering around a building once, I knew I was in the right spot - then I found a dummy utility box (with unknown stenciled acronym) that had been mounted on the outside. With conduit leading into the ground. With a lock on it...&nbsp; but it opened from top for the cache itself. I was very impressed. [This is not a big secret; turns out it&#039;s a common geocache trick.]<br />I went back 3 years later and it was still there, so apparently mgmt never noticed or didn&#039;t care, &quot;it&#039;s just some metal box, must belong to some utility.&quot;<br /><br />You are correct,&nbsp; dirt is not a confusing factor for dogs. There are dogs that alert to orca shit.&nbsp; 18&quot; of potting soil does not constitute razzle-dazzle.<br /><br />**Decontamination of the outside of anything is crucial.**&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s a fun project - really, it is, it involves black lights:<br />Test package cleaning sometime using a technique the infectious disease people use to teach handwashing.<br />Make up a dummy batch of whatever. Cover it with fluorescent powder (Glitter Bug is the one I&#039;ve seen, Glo Germ is another one). It&#039;s not visible in room light.<br />Great.<br />Now package it.<br />Now package it for shipping.<br /><br />Now... get out the black light and look for glowy bits. Walk around.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done this for fingerprints for a kid&#039;s science lab, and for handwashing (Get Your Free OCD Here!), and, well, for learning about scent discrimination/scent transfer. It&#039;s made me *very respectful* of contamination. <br />Try dusting something from the moment it arrives and see how effective &#039;clean&#039; technique is/is not.<br /><br />The glow-in-the-dark powder is also fun to play with on its own. :)<br /><br />On a less fun note, it and similar products get used sometimes by LE in packages during larger controlled deliveries, per assorted complaints/affidavits; wait for the package to be opened; wait some minutes; go in and examine everyone&#039;s mitts. &quot;Caught glowing-blue handed.&quot; [Hmm. Not sure what happens if you happen to have a big thing of Glitter Bug already in the house....]

				So yeah, offsite storage is best, where you can make sure you aren&#039;t followed. But forget the vac seals, USE MBB. Also for short term if you don&#039;t have smell handled, get it the fuck out of there. Like they said, unless you&#039;re big shit, the cops search probably won&#039;t be too thorough, as long as you can think outside the box and smell proof it. Just take into account how long it takes you to get things in and out of said storage, and how often. As well as any possible wear/signs you might cause from disturbing your spot so many times. <br /><br />But dude, it is just as likely that they show up tomorrow as next year, so you NEED to make this your 1st priority. Don&#039;t get lazy, get your system and stick to it.
