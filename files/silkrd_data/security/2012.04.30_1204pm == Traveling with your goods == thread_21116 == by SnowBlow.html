				Anyone have experience with airport security? Say I wanted to take an 8 ball with me. Is it better in my pocket? Or in my carry on luggage?

				I mean it all depends on the airport I think.&nbsp; My local airport although kind of a bigger one has pretty laxed security, Ive unknowningly walked thru with stuff before, and Ive never taken more than 15 minutes to get thru security.&nbsp; Now thats not the same for every airport ive been to and with those body scanners now Id be real skeptical.&nbsp; I dont have any advice for getting it through but I would avoid doing so if at all possible

				Personally mate, I&#039;d just forward it in your mail. <br /><br />I mean if you want to take the risk then obviously that is up to you, but personally I wouldn&#039;t take any amount of anything through any airport. Or even if you don&#039;t want to post it to yourself is it really that hard to find drugs wherever you are going? Doubt it, just have to be smart when you look.

				Iv heard having something on the sole of your foot is a good place, but personally i wouldn&#039;t risk it. just post it ahead of you or try and get some gear when you get there.

				3.5g of coke in an airport? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!<br />That&#039;s such a terrible idea. Think about how bad one of those TSA goons wants to get you in that back room and rethink your decision to get high.<br /><br />put it up your ass<br />or swallow it in a condom and shit it out<br />no kidding. you won&#039;t get caught.
