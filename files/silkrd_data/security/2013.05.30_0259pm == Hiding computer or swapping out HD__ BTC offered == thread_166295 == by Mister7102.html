				I am trying to take the most precautions because of the recent LR bust and Dwolla bust it seems as if the Feds have figured out that if they want to hurt us then they have to attack the money.&nbsp; What many others have thought all along.&nbsp; So I want to be more cautious...should I look at keeping my computer at a remote location or is it possible to just leave the SR hard drive at another location and swap out when I get there?&nbsp; I&#039;m having some difficulties with doubting myself and the security level that I am currently at.&nbsp; Right now I just use the tor browser bundle with pgp for orders.&nbsp; I am also aware to all of the delivery precautions about not signing and having a story and asking for an attorney if ever questioned.&nbsp; I was just in a tight situation riding dirty in a car and passed the police officers first line of stiff questioning with flying colors.&nbsp; I know my rights and know how to invoke them.&nbsp; I&#039;m computer savvy enough to get here but that is about it.&nbsp; Again I am interested in any security upgrade with the whole tech side of this.&nbsp; I would prefer to hear from a dealer or a large time buyer, not someone who orders small personal amounts.&nbsp; Any advice w/o smartass comments would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I did not come to the forums to get ridiculed or belittled I came here to ask for help, what I thought these forums were for!<br />I am not a snitch, I&#039;ve been here for a long time and have stats to prove it.&nbsp; I have reputable vendors to prove it.&nbsp; I am offering a small sum for someone that is willing to help me upgrade, have a convo on where I am at and what I should really do to protect myself better.&nbsp; If anyone is really curious it&#039;s because I have 2 strikes and live pretty much in a no tolerance area of the nation, next step for me is bye-bye.&nbsp; I know the risks and choose to play the game, however I will stop over this new insecurity if I cant squash it.&nbsp; I just feel that the probability is increasing, and it&#039;s not as safe as it was a year ago.<br /><br />

				If your really concerned about security check out the Apricorn Aegis Padlock.&nbsp; It&#039;s an external USB 1 Terrabyte Harddrive with 256 Bit Hardware encryption.

				If you need an absolutely clean computer, instead of dealing with swapping out hard drives, put Tails on a thumb drive and use that for sensitive activities. If the shit hits the fan, flush it down the toilet, throw it in a drain, whatever. Thumb drives are easy to get rid of.

				I&#039;m not a vendor or power buyer, but here is how I run things:<br /><br />Personally I only connect to TOR through a VPN and frequently change legal jurisdiction, careful to avoid my own. Let&#039;s see local LE subpoena records from a Russian VPN provider (after they manage to break TOR anonymity to get the VPN IP in the first place). <br /><br />As for the computer itself, I use Truecrypt cascading data encryption (TWOFISH-SERPENT-AES).&nbsp; I always run whole disk encryption, and wouldn&#039;t even consider a password under 30 characters (uppercase, lower case, special characters, numbers... you only need to memorize it once, make it count). I also use a laptop that has no battery with a cumbersome cord run across the room. This will let me yank the cord out and cut power from anywhere in the house in a couple seconds, engaging the encryption. If I have a smoke when my computer is on, it&#039;s in the basement (knock on the door = flip power main... same is yanking the power cord). I would never leave home with that laptop powered up. <br /><br />No one can get to my computer while it&#039;s on, and even with a super computer it will take trillions of years to brute force the encryption.<br /><br /><br />

				Tails is a full fledged operating system that comes with TorBrowser and other apps that are pre-configured to use Tor.<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org<br /><br />You need to burn it to a DVD, then clone it to a USB to enable the persistent volume.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a thread about it:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.0<br />
