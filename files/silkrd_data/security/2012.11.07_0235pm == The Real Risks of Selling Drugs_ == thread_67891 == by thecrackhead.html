				Hi guys, I was just wondering what are the major risks that occur while selling drugs.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that I managed to develop a plan that keeps me 98% safe from police I&#039;ve thought about it for months now and I got to the point where I eliminated all the possible, impossible, expected and unexpected errors that may occur.<br /><br />My plan involves selling the drugs in main clubs across UK, themed parties, festivals etc.<br /><br />The only thing I am worried about are the other dealers, I&#039;m not a racist but living in UK, you see all the time black people stabbing each other over blackberries, lame bitches and semi-retarded reasons beyond any logic.<br /><br />I don&#039;t street-fight too often but I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m a pussy either. I would rather solve any conflict with words than punching and kicking like an animal.<br /><br />My question now is:<br /><br />How big of a risk am I taking by going in a club and start selling my shit considering that I&#039;m not the only dealer in that club.<br /><br />I have been to many clubs and parties and I bought different stuff from different dealers in the same club and a conflict never occurred. However I would like to hear your opinions and your points of view if you don&#039;t mind.<br /><br />I know, I know, there will be people yelling that you can never be safe from polices side. But I will run my business in such a way that even if I sell to cops I&#039;ll end up getting away with it at least first time as I don&#039;t have any previous convictions. No, my statement is not entirely based on the fact that I don&#039;t have previous convictions. It&#039;s just that I am not comfortable with sharing my plan.<br />&nbsp;<br />As I said before I would like to hear your thoughts and opinions on my concerns and also if you could come up with other problems that may occur.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.

				It usually depends on how big the dealer is, and how big you are. Most club or festival-level dealers aren&#039;t ready to go and kill you for selling 10 pills on their turf when they push 100 every night...<br /><br />If you go in there with 100 pills, 10 grams of coke and an 8 ball of k, that&#039;s when he might think &quot;what the fuck&quot; and at the very least want a little word with you.

				The clubs I frequent are often loaded with undercover cops and not only do other dealers hate you but the club owners might also get you kicked out.<br /><br />You will have many more enemies than friend and you&#039;re basically just streetscum that&#039;s going to land in jail after 3 weeks

First time I&#039;m going to be safe after that I&#039;ll have to lay low and take a different approach. It&#039;s easy money and it doesn&#039;t involve much stress, resources and a big investment.<br /><br />I&#039;m not planning to do it for 10 years tho...of course my plan has few different steps. You can&#039;t sell big being a nobody without getting ripped of can you? <br /><br />Thanks for the concern and good wishes.

				Your main weakness from I can read is the very basis of your selling operation. Selling in clubs to random people that you don&#039;t know, which are already overrun with UC LE (undercover), you WILL eventually sell to an undercover. He may not bust you, but it could start an investigation, which is something you don&#039;t want...<br /><br />The safest way to sell these drugs is to only sell to people you know and trust. No new customers without a few referrals and no meeting anyone new until they buy through a referrer multiple times. You definitely don&#039;t know and trust everyone you&#039;re selling to at a club.

				Dude, no offense but if you think that plan will keep you &#039;98% safe&#039; you&#039;re fooling yourself. You WILL sell to LE and you WILL end up doing time. You&#039;ve picked the most obvious place to sell which is littered with LE and you&#039;re selling to strangers.<br /><br />Start small. Sell to who you know. Develop a clientele SLOWLY of people you can trust. Then grow and sell to dealers that sell smart. <br /><br />There&#039;s no fast and easy money in this game, and selling on the street is the riskiest with the lowest reward.

				Maybe I&#039;m missing something but why would you consider selling drugs at clubs (which sucks for everybody involved) when you already have an account on a website that is pretty good for that sort of thing? Set up a vendor account and sell product as fast as you can get hold of it.

				IMO you shouldn&#039;t have too much to worry about as long as you aren&#039;t encroaching on gang territory, if not then you shouldn&#039;t have any problems, just remember to sell the appropriate drug for the club, I.E. i wouldn&#039;t bring meth to a coke club or party, that could cause some problems... But you say you have it down to a 99% chance of preventing capture? How did you accomplish that when selling publicly to strangers? How are you going to weed out under-covers or all the other shit that goes with public dealings? Well I guess you probably wanna keep that to yourself huh? lol Anyways goodluck and stay safe out there...<br /><br /><br />MMM
