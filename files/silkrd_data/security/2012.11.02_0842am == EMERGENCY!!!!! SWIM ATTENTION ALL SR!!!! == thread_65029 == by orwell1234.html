				Someone Who Isn&#039;t Me! SWIM! that being said PANIC FUCKING PANIC. This weekend swim&#039;s local news covered an arrest involving drugs shipped in the mail. SWIM really needs advice on what to do as swim may or may not have a package in the mail. Here is the link to the story so everyone knows this isn&#039;t bull shit and all swims should be aware. http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/PCB-Woman-Arrested-for-Receiving-a-Package-Containing-Drugs-176856281.html<br />clear net. SWIM is frantically searching for peace but not finding it. This looks to be a botched silk road arrangement. If you guys would circulate this not only among your self&#039;s as buyers and&nbsp; also to vendors. Should SWIM send message to vendor to warn to take extra precaution or would that make vendor uneasy SWIM doesn&#039;t want to inflame the situation anymore. Any input guys is appreciated. THANKS!!!!

				Here&#039;s the whole article. As it says on my profile: Don&#039;t incriminate yourself!!! Duh! OP Calm the fuck down.<br /><br />Modzi<br /><br />*****<br /><br />﻿﻿PCB Woman Arrested for Receiving a Package Containing Drugs<br /><br />50 year old Lisa Robinson was developed as a suspect when the package showed up at the Post Office addressed to a home on Dogwood Street. It was sent from New York.<br /><br />Bay County Sheriff&#039;s Investigators say they contacted Robinson who told them the package contained cocaine and heroin. Investigators say the heroin was divided into twenty individual packets. <br /><br />Robinson was arrested and charged with possession of heroin, possession on crack cocaine, unlawful use of a two way communication device and principal to introduction of a controlled substance into the state of Florida.<br />

				DOH!<br /><br />best way to get arrested is to tell the cops youve got a speedball<br /><br />and people have been getting arrested for drugs in the mail for years...<br /><br />...not just because of SR did people all of a sudden start receiving goods from the post man<br /><br />ah PCB, good times in bumper to bumper traffic on the strip watching the traveling freak show

				well imho if you (or swiy, whatever) are worried then just don&#039;t open the package when you receive it, don&#039;t sign for anything, and take it back to the post or bin it, as if it arrived by mistake, there&#039;s no way they can prove the package was meant for you unless you admit it or they catch you with the stuff in hand or at home. i&#039;m no lawyer but if a package with drugs was enough to get you in trouble what&#039;s to stop me from sending envelopes to my asshole neighbors to get them locked away?

				Man I was so high when I first posted this hence the paranoia.....SWIM the by product of a frantic mind lol...Yeah I understand she told on herself but the package was intercepted at the post office and then they contacted her she could of easily denied any and all involvement and maybe she did the police could be making this look like an open and shut case I believe something else went on that&#039;s not in the article.

				Cops want you to &#039;respect&#039; them, so just PRETEND to be respectful while keeping your mouth as shut as possible.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just go completely silent if you&#039;re pulled over or something, that&#039;s a huge sign of disrespect and will piss the pig off.<br /><br />If they ask, do you know how fast you were going?, ADMIT that you were speeding A BIT, like 5km/hr over even if you were doing 15km/hr. because they ALREADY KNOW how fast you were going, that&#039;s why they pulled you over.&nbsp; They are testing your honesty and i&#039;ve gotten out of many ticket&#039;s by pretending to be honest and pretending to respect the cop, just DONT SAY ANYTHING MORE THEN YOU NEED TO.<br /><br />Just using speeding as an example but it applies in general to any situation, NEVER disclose any details of the situation that you are sure the cop doesn&#039;t already know with absolute certainty (eg. if they pull you over for speeding you know they&#039;ve clocked you with their radar and they already know how fast you were going).<br /><br />Try and stay as silent as possible, but try and put forth an air of respect and honesty to the cop and they&#039;ll probably be a hell of a lot more lenient on you cuz your probably the first person of their day that didn&#039;t just outright lie when they have physical proof to the contrary.<br /><br />Still keep as silent as possible, but if you just don&#039;t respond to their demands or anything they say you&#039;re putting forth a smug and disrespectful tone and that aint gonna help you, just be polite, speaking neutral words like &quot;yes officer, i&#039;m putting my hands up&quot; or whatever.<br /><br />Also if they stop you on the street you have every right to ask them if they are arresting or detaining you, and if they just randomly picked you off the street like they do a lot they&#039;ll often have no choice but to say no, in which case you just say &quot;well i&#039;m in a hurry so have a good day officer&quot;.<br /><br />There&#039;s a limit to those DON&#039;T SPEAK lawyer videos on youtube, you can speak, just don&#039;t speak about the situation or anything relating to you or the situation, just try and speak and act with respect and maturity even though you and me both hate fucking pigs.

				Here&#039;s a little anecdote from &quot;SWIM&quot; about &quot;remaining silent&quot; in practice. For purposes of narration, I shall write it in the first person. ;)<br /><br />During an especially tumultuous time in my life, I was pulled over on my way home from a 12-hour drinking binge. I was actually blacked out when I got pulled over- I &quot;came to&quot; as the officer was questioning me at my car window.<br /><br />He asked me to take a field sobriety test. I politely refused.<br /><br />He asked me to take a breathalyzer. I politely refused.<br /><br />&quot;Have you had anything to drink tonight?&quot; No answer. If I&#039;d said &quot;just a couple of beers,&quot; they could have nailed me; I &quot;appeared intoxicated&quot; and even admitted to drinking! By staying silent they had no real evidence that I was drinking that night.<br /><br />&quot;Where are you coming from?&quot; No answer. I could have made something up, but I was coming from a bar, and if they could somehow figure that out (credit card records maybe), they would have caught me in a lie, which is never good. (The &quot;Don&#039;t Talk to Police&quot; video mentions a similar scenario.)<br /><br />The only question I answered that night was whether I had anything in my pockets that would stick him, because that&#039;s the only thing he actually needed to know. (The answer was &quot;no&quot;, by the way!)<br /><br />The police department hated my fucking guts because I was completely uncooperative (with the exception of actually physically resisting arrest.) In fact, they hated me SO much that they waited until just five minutes before the trial to offer me a plea bargain that brought the DUI down to a minor traffic offense. :)<br /><br />I somewhat regret taking the deal and not going to trial- had I gone to trial and won, I wouldn&#039;t have even had to pay the fine for the reduced &quot;charge&quot; (essentially a ticket.) Even my lawyer wanted to give it a shot. It&#039;s quite possible that they wouldn&#039;t have even bothered trying me and just dropped everything. But, as the prosecutor knew, if you give someone a deal that guarantees they&#039;re not gonna get a DUI, they&#039;re gonna go for it- even if they&#039;re assholes like me.<br /><br />So yeah, I more-or-less got away with a very stupid thing (don&#039;t drive blacked out, kids!) by keeping my mouth shut, and I have that fucking YouTube video to thank for it.<br /><br />The reason why staying silent is better than trying to talk your way out of/around something is because you&#039;re walking in a fucking minefield. You don&#039;t know what they know, so you don&#039;t know how far you have to bend the truth. You run the risk of lying too much or too little.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you&#039;re questioned about a confiscated order. They ask you if you&#039;ve ever purchased Bitcoins. You think &quot;shit, I used my real name on that Instawallet deposit once. They probably already know about it.&quot; So you say you&#039;ve bought Bitcoins, sure. &quot;Why?&quot; Um, because you&#039;re really into decentralized, pseudonymous cryptocurrencies. They&#039;re fun. &quot;What did you buy with the Bitcoins?&quot; Amazingly, you&#039;re able to think of an item off the top of your head that you can buy with Bitcoins and isn&#039;t drugs. &quot;When did you make this purchase?&quot; About a year ago, you don&#039;t know. &quot;Who did you purchase the item from?&quot; Um, you can&#039;t remember. Some website. &quot;Do you still possess this item?&quot; No...<br /><br />Meanwhile, it turns out they didn&#039;t know anything about Bitcoin acquisition and never would have found out about the Instawallet deposit. But now they know that you&#039;ve bought Bitcoins. Is that enough to convict you? Maybe not, but they just have a few more questions...<br /><br />If you think it&#039;s worth the risk, you can try to smooth talk your way out of stuff- hell, I always attempt this with minor traffic offenses. Worst case scenario they write you the $90 ticket anyway, but at least you tried. But if it&#039;s a serious charge, I would stay quiet. The officer might yell and stomp his feet, but when they end up dropping the charges at the last minute for lack of evidence (or never even bring charges), you&#039;ll know it was worth it.

				i have a similar story to the one above,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to cut this short but to the point.<br /><br />A friend of mine got arrested for possession of a large quantity of dope while driving in his car.<br />The cops took him to the station for questioning and so on, they had him in the interview room(this was before they started video taping interview, they were only on cassette back then) asking him heaps of questions and he answered some of them.<br /><br />When the cops&nbsp; started the tape for the interview my friend did not say a word, they asked him his name, age address what he had in the car and all the typical questions, he did not answer one of them, he made no comment no remark no sound at all so the cops stopped the tape and decided to take him to court for trafficing.<br /><br />now here is the kicker, because the cops did not have him on tape and had no proof that he was even in the interview room and had no comments to offer the court, the judge through the case out of court as the cops had no proof of anything except for the 10 ounces they charged him with(which was actually 15 ounces, where did the other 5 go? hmm) and couldn&#039;t even prove he was there let alone that he had drugs on him.<br /><br />now i dont know if the cops could have done anything else to help their case but the fact is that my mate got away with it. <br /><br />they could prob prove he was in the station but couldn&#039;t prove anything else.

				Cops love interrogations, they get paid OT if they make it a lengthy one, and they KNOW that you are shitting your pants (regardless if you&#039;re silent or 100% innocent even) and love to force their &#039;authority&#039; on you.<br /><br />So yeah, do what the last guy said and don&#039;t say a word.&nbsp; They ARE allowed to lie to you too, remember that.
