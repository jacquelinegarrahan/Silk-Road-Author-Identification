				Buyer received their care package (2 separate transactions) and released the funds to me and left feedback. In my account it only shows that one transactions btc was released. When I check my account history it says that both were released no withdraw or anything. Does anyone know if there is a delay in the system when the funds are released or did my coins vanish?<br /><br />Edit: SR vendor support has been contacted btw. Just wondering if anyone has had this occur to them too.
