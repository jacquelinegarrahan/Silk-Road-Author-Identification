				Ok, So I am ready to make an SR purchase, but I can&#039;t figure out how to get my bitcoins out. I had money in a Dwolla account which I transferred to MtGox and that went smoothly, but now I would like to transfer my bitcoins from MtGox to Bitcoin Fog and then to SR. (Tell me if I can skip this step if its safe to just go without Bitcoin Fog.) On Bitcoin Fog and SR both have an address to send bitcoins to, but I don&#039;t know how to send them from MtGox.<br /><br />please help a newb.

				Hi,&nbsp; I had a similar question as I just tried to make my first buy and lost my coins moving them from mtgox to an instawallet (from which I was then going to move them to SR.&nbsp; Just to verify, for personal buying, is it safe to move straight from MtGox to SR or should their be another transfer between? Was wondering if anyone can confirm Goatamongus&#039;s comment that its ok?&nbsp; Also, what is the purpose of the bitcoin.org personal wallet?&nbsp; If anyone has any tips for moving coins to SR, would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Many thanks.

The vendor accounts in SR have a built in mixer to make it impossible to provide a link between their transaction and yours. <br /><br />V.
