				I don&#039;t want to deposit cash into a bank so I can write a check.<br /><br />Is there anyway that I can have a check made out to the landlord that will not run my transaction through a clearing house that checks for questionable transactions?

				You would fucking go into that dealership and be like &quot;Look bitches, I&#039;m gonna buy an escalade and I&#039;m paying cash... how much of a discount are you giving me?&quot; and I would make them cream their pants. Look dude, everyone LOVES cash and no one is going to question shit if you&#039;re providing them with lots of hard cash (unless its a bank, they will question the fuck out of that shit).

				You should just tell him you&#039;re a waiter or something and you get cash tips, choose not to keep a bank account because of trust and convenience issues, and that you prefer to pay your landlord in cash. I don&#039;t see why he needs a check. If I was a landlord I&#039;d take cash all day.

				Buy it used off Craigslist or something. Give the dealer cash, tell him to report that the amount paid was much less than it actually was if he wants to complete the deal. At that point the private dealer will probably want to work with you cuz he&#039;s getting extra under the table cash that he won&#039;t have to report either. In other words, you need to meet people who have a similar mindset as you, and there are plenty of them out there.

				Hardship sales happen all the time where people let something go for significantly below its value because they need the money and they need it now. I don&#039;t know what the going rate is on a 2012 Escalade. Would depend on condition and miles and whatnot. But, keep it somewhat reasonable. If the Kelly Blue Book value is 10x the amount he sold it to you for you might draw some attention. Maybe you need to stop being so show-offy is another recommendation, no offense. The people who always get caught are the ones that ask the questions your asking and want to live the life you&#039;re dreaming about. If you made a lot of illegal money, lay low and figure out a way to launder it before you go buy a bunch of cars. Making money is only half the problem... learning how to use it is where the real challenge begins.
