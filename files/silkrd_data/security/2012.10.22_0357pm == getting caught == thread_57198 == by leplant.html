				my question is, does anyone really get caught unless they do something stupid? my explanation, as long as you make your btc purchases anonymous and don&#039;t tell anyone, does anyone actually go to jail for getting drugs in the mail? i&#039;ve been on SR for a few months and have finally gotten the money to buy 4 ounces to start dealing. i thought i had everything in order but i feel i&#039;m missing something. this is just to easy and i feel there is something i&#039;m not thinking about. my plan is to order the weed and have it sent to either me or my friends address....from what i&#039;ve heard if they catch you they just confinscate it and send you a letter.&nbsp; does anyone have anything to add to my situation?

				I recall reading about some dumb teenagers that got busted because their parents turned them in. If your mom doesn&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing or she&#039;s alright with it you should be fine.<br /><br />So in my opinion from SR side you are safe they (LE) won&#039;t go for guys like you. They would rather go for the vendors but I don&#039;t know if they are bothering themselves with that either. They just seize whatever they can to show it to their bosses.<br /><br />What you do with the drugs after you get them it&#039;s your problem just be wise while dealing...The problem is not SR...

				4 ounces is a little much to just assume you will only face confiscation... sure, when people order personal amounts like a few grams, its probably personal, and they wont really be worth the time or effort so likely just receive a love letter<br /><br />people have definitely been busted from receiving illegal substances through the mail... and have certainly gone to jail for it.&nbsp; maybe not very many if at all from SR because most vendors use pretty safe packaging methods, but it would be very unwise to think there is no risk. <br /><br />if you happen to be unlucky and they intercept such a large order then they will probably assume it is for distribution and may do a controlled delivery or put the occupants under surveillance. they may not connect it to SR if it is discovered and you kept the delivery address and computer clean, but still there can be severe consequences just for the package alone if you are busted

				Better not buy &quot;bulk&quot; then ;)<br /><br />I think using SR and bitcoins in a secure way and using your head if problems do rise up is the best thing you can do.<br />Sad thing is that most people don&#039;t know how to do that.<br /><br />Bah, why am I even saying this. Most dealers make shitloads of money with selling stuff they get for little money themselves. Since I do not promote ripping people off I will stop giving advise&nbsp; :P<br />If you get busted then you probably did or say something stupid and you shouldn&#039;t be dealing/buying anyway.<br /><br />
