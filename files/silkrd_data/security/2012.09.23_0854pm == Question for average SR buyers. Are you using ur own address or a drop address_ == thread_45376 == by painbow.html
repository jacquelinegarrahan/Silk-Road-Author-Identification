				The usual advice is to use your real name and own address if you&#039;re just an average buyer.<br /><br />But, I&#039;m wondering how many people are actually just using their own address or made the effort to find a drop address.

				So... which is a better option?&nbsp; Ordering to my house with my name, or ordering to a UPS box with my name.....???&nbsp; I don&#039;t have access to legit fake id&#039;s and UPS says that you must have a second valid form of ID to sign up for a UPS box.&nbsp; Could I use a made up amazon business name for my UPS box name?&nbsp; It would still be attached to my name but I wouldn&#039;t have to put my name in the shipping address.&nbsp; Your thoughts?

				Empty flats or offices are good drop locations. You can usually walk straight into the building and pick up your package. Have a look on your local estate agents for suitable buildings. Make sure you send something though the post first to make sure it arrives before ordering.<br /><br />But, that&#039;s such an effort if you are only buying for personal use. Just use your real name and address and deny any allegations if your caught. Anyone can send anything to anyone through the post.

				I have a po box with legitimate info and use my actual name to ship things.&nbsp; I&#039;m still a newb and waiting on my second order but no problems with the first.&nbsp; I also know someone who has it shipped to his home with his actual info and has completed 10+ large quantity orders no problem.&nbsp; I&#039;d say just do some more research on here and go with what makes you feel better.&nbsp; Fact of the matter is there are smarter ways than others but at the end of the day its all illegal and risky.

In the grand scheme of things, I&#039;m not at all worried about the package being intercepted or being the target of LE sting.<br /><br />To me the drop address provides cover for the most likely of scenarios -- accidental discovery of your order. Like I said, forget being worried about STRING, I worry about the dumb-ass postal worker who ends up ripping my package open by mistake. Better yet, the old retired lady who works at UPS Store part time,&nbsp; finds illegal drugs that she blames in the suicide of her Nephews while trying to stuff your package into a small box. This is the person who is compelled to call the police. The good Samaritan bumble fuck who feels its their civic duty to inform the authorities. That&#039;s what I worry about.&nbsp; I feel a drop address helps to minimize this type of risk.

				See I&#039;m on the opposite end of the scale... Use correct details. I&#039;ve read on a number of different vendors profiles that they ask for people to use a real name, BECAUSE they&#039;ve had experiences with packages not arriving when fake names are used. I know this to be true, just 2 months ago this happened to a friend here in the UK. Legal package, just a few documents, but couldn&#039;t get delivered and required ID as well as collection just because the name wasn&#039;t correct. From my experiences, this is a little bit much paranoia taken by the postal company, but it has happened now, so just taken as a learning curve. <br /><br />We don&#039;t really have drop-boxes here in the UK, well sorry - we do but they&#039;re not as common. But your &quot;plausable deniability&quot; does go out the window if investigated, I believe. <br /><br />If ordering to a residential address, absolutely use correct details. If there&#039;s ever any issue, put on a stupid face and deny ordering any such products or having any association with them. Remember, you&#039;re innocent until proven guilty; using fake names isn&#039;t exactly a mitigating factor... <br /><br />Just put some thought into (everything) before you do it, weight up the costs and don&#039;t worry. LE are much more interested in going after the sellers, more-so than the buyers.

				I think using a PO Box is silly because for a letter to get to the PO Box, the address must be exact, you can&#039;t accidentlly send something to a PO Box

				So is it unsafe if I use my real address and name? I don&#039;t have access to any drops or fake IDs, so doing something like a UPS Box isn&#039;t possible. I&#039;m only going to ordering soft drugs like Cannabis.

				Just use your regular address. Postal workers know to look for suspicious activity like drop locations.<br />better idea is to use your PREVIOUS TENANTS name. the ones who rented or owned your place before you.

				I use my real name and a real post office box.&nbsp; I have the post office box for a small biz that I run so if anything ever happens I&#039;m just going to plead ignorance.&nbsp; That post office box address is published on the web - anybody can find it and use it to send whatever they want to send, eh?&nbsp; <br /><br />To me, using a fake address or the address of an abandoned building or house or whatever more or less guarantees that you won&#039;t get the package.&nbsp; Mail carriers walk the same route every day - some have been doing it for 20-30-40 years and I&#039;m pretty sure my mailman knows more about me than my mother does.&nbsp; They certainly know which addresses on their routes are occupied and which are not.&nbsp; Unless the package is addressed to the former occupant it might arouse suspicion.&nbsp; The package is probably going to be returned marked Undeliverable to the sender who (hopefully) IS using a fake address. <br /><br />I don&#039;t worry about having packages delivered to my real address - I do $50-$100 transactions and I&#039;d like to think that LE has better things to worry about than my miniscule transactions- that&#039;s the way I see it anyway ...

				There seems to be some confusion here. By &quot;drop&quot; i mean a house/office not connected to me in anyway. And i do this to avoid handing over my details to vendors!

Do be prudent, do encrypt your address when ordering. But also, use a legitimate mailing address so your order doesn&#039;t get re-routed or sent back. That&#039;s my 2 Bitcoins worth.
