				Okay I&#039;m not even high, but here&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking: I always start to get a bit paranoid when something like SR can go so smooth for so long without any kind of infiltration. I mean, it&#039;s just always too good to be true. <br /><br />Isn&#039;t it? Too illegal, and too good to be true for this long.

				Well, if they have infiltrated SR, they aren&#039;t doing a very good job of stopping me from getting my drugs.

				The expectation from everyone in the community is to act according to the principle that anyone on here could be LE.<br /><br />This means cover your tracks.&nbsp; Use PGP, don&#039;t post incriminating or real-life things on here that could indicate who or where you are.&nbsp; keep a big, fat-assed layer of plausable deniability in everything you do.&nbsp; Vet out your sellers thoroughly, make sure you are using vendors who have extremely high rates of successful shipments and are known and recommended by a large portion of the community for their professionalism in every aspect of their business. <br /><br />There is always risk, but if you mitigate it enough and just stay sharp even a full takeover of this site by LE would mean you are just a username on an illicit drug site.&nbsp; Same thing goes for sellers - keep all of your shit encrypted 100% of the time, package like a pro, ship like a pro, give nothing of your identity away because as a seller that is ALL you have.&nbsp; LE doesn&#039;t want buyers - they only use buyers in real life to get sellers, and that isn&#039;t an option here.&nbsp; They want sellers, always.&nbsp; If everyone stays sharp we can avoid ramifications from a takeover ever happening.<br /><br />

				Oh, we have been infiltrated!!! Do NOT be fooled. Sneaky f**K*RS!! They&#039;re on site and forums. Trying. Maintenance keeps us safe and makes it more difficult for LE. Let&#039;s get a &quot;You have mail&quot; or a &quot;DING&quot; so I do not miss any messages or orders and START BANNING SUSPECTED LE and SCAM ARTISTS!! Give um da boot in therr arse!<br /><br />&nbsp;Let&#039;s make it so new buyers have to pay to use the site. Send your bitcoins to me or make arrangements to send me your USD ($350).&nbsp; After receipt of USD or bitcoins I will then give you permission to use the site. That is a great idea. BUT... In these tough economic times ONLY LE could afford that much. I will take the payment and post there names as suspect and why.
