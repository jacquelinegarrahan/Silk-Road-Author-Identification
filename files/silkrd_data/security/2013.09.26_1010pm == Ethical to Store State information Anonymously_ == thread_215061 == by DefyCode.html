				Hi guys and girls,<br /><br />I was contemplating storing just the States (no zipcode or anything like that) where orders are coming from in a spreadsheet, no buyer usernames or transaction numbers would be storedb to do be able to do some analytic stuff. Would that be considered unethical or a violation of trust? If the community thinks so then I won&#039;t do that. <br /><br />

				But...why? What&#039;s your reasoning behind this?<br />I feel like it would be a huge mistake on your part with regards to security.<br />Also...buyers are not fans of any information being stored regardless of how much or how little it is.<br />Just sayin&#039;

				Against me? I don&#039;t think it would. I&#039;m not concerned about that. I&#039;m more concerned with how everyone feels about it.<br /><br />This exactly what it would look like in CSV format<br /><br />DC,CA,CA,CA,LA,AK,OR,WA,OR,MO,TX,AR,AR,WA, etc etc<br /><br />Nothing compromising in itself. Just State names like this. A single row or column. Simple.<br /><br />I know it wouldnt be breaking any rule per se since no uniquely identifiable stuff is being stored, no addresses no transaction amounts, etc. But I respect my SR fam to much to not get a general idea of how the fam feels about it and then act based on that feeling.<br /><br />:)

				Yep, you&#039;re right. It would ultimately be wasteful. I heard enough. Not doing it. Thread closed.
