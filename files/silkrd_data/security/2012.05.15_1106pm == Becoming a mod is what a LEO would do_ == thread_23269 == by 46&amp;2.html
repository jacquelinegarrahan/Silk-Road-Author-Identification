				What kind of privileges and or controls are gained by posting, until mod status is reached?<br />I know it takes tons of time/man-power to do this, but, the DEA and other agencies of the same country are famous for wasting money and time.<br /><br /><br />

				If you&#039;re referring to Limetless it is HIGHLY unlikely he is from any government agency considering he is shipping out drugs to people all over the world.&nbsp; From what I have heard, law enforcement can&#039;t do this.&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)<br /><br />To answer your question I honestly don&#039;t think becoming a MOD on Silk Road Forums helps the DEA in anyway.&nbsp; I love feeling like a drug lord but in all honesty, I don&#039;t think we are the people the government are after.<br /><br />

The government would be wasting their time tracking down individual buyers... It would only be a matter of time before we found out... we see enough posts on here about &#039;seized&#039; orders as it is :o<br /><br />The feud between Limetless and Mister Dank is pure banter, I always enjoy reading them posts.

				Becoming a mod is exactly what a LEO would do.&nbsp; LEO can sell drugs.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t you seen those documentaries of police infiltrating for years to gather evidence?

				The road keeps cache tags of the browser, you can easily verify that I am not Mister Dank.&nbsp; The fact that we say the same thing just means that we think alike, he may be semi-paranoid, but it&#039;s true.&nbsp; I am only posting on here because I believe the route we are taking is morally wrong.&nbsp; The fact that you keep bringing up that I&#039;m Mister Dank just leads me to believe you really are UK LEO, you truly believe there&#039;s only one person on here who believes you&#039;re LEO?&nbsp; Everyone who comes out against you must be the same person!

				Cacoethes - I&#039;d be more than happy to post your address 50 times a day under different user names.&nbsp; My buds and I can even pay you a visit if you like? (Yes, I really do have YOUR address) Chain of evidence = you retards giving your real name and address, and then being in possession of what ever was sent when we break down your door with a battering ram.&nbsp; Now with our CISPA powers, we have even more evidence that can be used against you in a court of law. Silk Road is going down bud, get over it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t believe me? Don&#039;t care.&nbsp; What&#039;s even better is the fact that the forum is easily hacked, and I&#039;ve personally been in thousands of SR accounts, most of you fucking retards use the same password and username.&nbsp; Not to steal or arouse suspicion, but, to collect the addresses you&#039;ve sent to non LEO vendors.&nbsp; PGP encryption? Hah, cracked in seconds. Get a life and learn to buy your drugs the old fashioned way, or I&#039;ll be personally paying YOU a visit.

				Mate you are so fucking sad you make the unhappy-mime look like a day out at Alton Towers. You really are just a sad, sad cunt. Full stop. <br /><br />What makes me laugh is that if you we LE then why the FUCK would you be telling us that you were LE? Make sense of that you degenerate stumble-bum mother fucker. I seriously doubt you can.<br /><br />Locked.
