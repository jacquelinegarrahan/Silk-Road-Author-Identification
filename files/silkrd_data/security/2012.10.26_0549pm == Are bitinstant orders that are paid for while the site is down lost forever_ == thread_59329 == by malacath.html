				Ok I&#039;m panicking a little! I placed an order on bitinstant a few days ago and chose to pay through a major bank branch via trustcash, the only problem is I just got around to paying it today (it was still valid, I had 4 days to pay) but when I logged onto my instawallet nothing had transferred, and when I went to bitinstant.com the site is down for repairs, is my order lost forever or is it just getting delayed because of the site being down?<br /><br />On a related note, all my bitinstant purchases have transferred to whatever bitcoin address I supplied within 10 minutes of paying through trustcash, this one still has not transferred and its been about 45 minutes, how long should I wait before I really start to panic?

				Try sending an email to Trustcash, give them your transaction number and the amount and as much info as you can. I have not been able to use the service myself - different bank, but I had a similar problem when I first tried. They are the people that handle the bank deposit and pass it on to Bitinstant, so they should be able to tell you more. Your order will not be lost, since they will have a copy of the details.<br />As for the second point, I have seen&nbsp; the maximum time of 2 hours quoted many times, after which you should start to panic. (Well don&#039;t panic, but time to start asking questions)
