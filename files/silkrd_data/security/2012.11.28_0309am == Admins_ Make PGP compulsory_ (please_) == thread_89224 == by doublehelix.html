				As you&#039;re probably aware, your rivals at BMR make it compulsory at least for the sellers (of the dominant stuff here) to utilize pgp and the keys are posted in profiles instead of a thread. They made it so that messages are encrypted by the site itself with the vendor&#039;s key, so customers don&#039;t need to do anything if they don&#039;t want to. Now you could be saying with a minimal number of posts, why should we listen to this dude? But it makes sense, and maybe with a bit more effort to make it more user-friendly for those among the community that are unfamiliar.. it could be done. <br /><br />Everyone needs to understand that privacy cant be taken for granted and needs to be asserted; and pgp isn&#039;t actually that complex for anyone who could find their way here. So why is this optional? Please consider.. thanks

				People on this forum have suggested making PGP mandatory by providing a test. For example, when you create an SR account, you add your public key to your profile and a code is encrypted to it. In order to activate your account, you have to decrypt the message and enter the code. I think it&#039;s a great idea, but it goes against DPR&#039;s goal of bringing drugs to the masses. Look into agorism and counter-economics.

The primary purpose of PGP is to protect the buyers info or communication if the site is compromised. If you let them do the encryption this means they have the cleartext and you have no protection at all. For PGP to be useful *IT MUST* be encrypted before the info leaves your computer. <br /><br />As for making it mandatory - I think that&#039;s the buyers responsibility. Neither SR nor the Vendor Really has any reason to force buyers to use it. I wont do business with any seller that does not use it , but that&#039;s my choice.
