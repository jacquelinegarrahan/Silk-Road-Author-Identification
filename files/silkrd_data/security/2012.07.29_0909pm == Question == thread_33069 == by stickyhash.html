				Hey guys i been looking around the site for awhile pretty amazed at all the stuff for sale, so I want to make a purchase, but nervous of the potential consequences, I dont like the thought of sending my address to someone I dont know and theres the possibility my address may be turned over to the cops if the dealer gets caught. .Im wondering if there is any sort of way to order a package somewhere other then your house or a P.O. box. Have any of you ever tried sending it to a vacant,or &#039;for sale&#039; house? Thanks for any feedback.

				dream on dude - postal employees dont have a life so the post office is their life and they try to remember every customer and weather or not <br />the house is vacant - who know if ur a baller and want to risk the coins u could try it to vacant &quot; HOUSE &quot; once before they catch on.<br />Just dont be a dick and blame the vendor for ur loss!!

				The least risky thing to do is send it to your real house, addressed to your real name.<br /><br />That way you have plausible deniability if anything were to go wrong. <br /><br />Think about it - anyone can send something to your house. But if they do see these drugs going to a vacant house, they&#039;re more likely to go wait and see who picks it up, and then you have NO deniability. <br /><br />Look into PGP/GPG encryption as well. <br /><br />Good luck.

				Yea PGP is a must on SR.&nbsp; You have no idea how fucking scary it is for large amounts of drugs coming to your home.&nbsp; I freaked the fuck out the first time, I freaked the second time, the third, fourth, fith, and I still clean up everything when I decide for it to come home.&nbsp; Luckily, I am out and about, and have clients that are not home during the day, and who are more then glad to let me use their mailbox:}&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />you will figure it out, trust me, at least if your not a complete idiot!!!<br /><br />Do not do vacant, that is the most stupid thing i have ever heard----maybe if its being worked on, just put a construction name on address----none the less-----Christy gives you good advice, dont blame vendors if you fuck up---on your side.<br /><br />No worries though, Christy will never deliver to either of our addresses, even though she is a bad ass with complete stealth packaging----she is wise however, so listen----and Christy------I got drilled for even writing something remotely inappropriate to you-----never again, and I did not even mean to be rude to you----she is well protected---but most of all wise to SR, so be open to those who speak truth!!!!
