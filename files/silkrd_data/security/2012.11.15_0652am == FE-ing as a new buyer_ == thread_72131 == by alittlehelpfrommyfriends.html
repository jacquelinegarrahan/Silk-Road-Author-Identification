				I have never bought anything before. I found a vendor with a product I want, but he/she requires FE-ing for those with less than 10 transactions. There&#039;s quite a bit of feedback from people who FE&#039;d and can vouch for the seller. However, I&#039;ve read in a couple of places that you should NEVER FE. What&#039;s the deal here? Is it common for new buyers to FE?

				It shouldn&#039;t be but, it is quite common.&nbsp; If your buying weed you can usually find a couple that still won&#039;t require FE but, I&#039;m not sure on the other items.&nbsp; If I were you, I would make ten small transactions in order to get your transaction numbers up.&nbsp; I know when you first arrive on the Road it&#039;s like a kid in a candy store.&nbsp; But, go slow at first.&nbsp; Get your transaction numbers up and get a feel for how things work.
