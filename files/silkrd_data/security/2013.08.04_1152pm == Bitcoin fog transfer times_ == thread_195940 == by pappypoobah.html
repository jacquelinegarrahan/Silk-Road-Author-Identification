				I made a withdrawal from my Bitcoin Fog account a couple hours ago with the minimum 6 hour time requirement and I&#039;m a little worried that something may be wrong. I am unable to log into my account, which means I cannot check it to see what&#039;s going on. When Bitcoin Fog transfers from my fog account, will all the coins show up at once in my SR account? Or will they progressively show up over the course of 6 hours? Also, when typing in my fog addres into blockchain, nothing shows up other than my initial deposit. Is this normal or should I see transactions going into the tumbler?

				Hey don&#039;t stress yet - I used this service a few times and it took -forever- for the coins to come through. They eventually did though. I never had any problems with them coming good, it just took time.

				Hey guys, I&#039;m also kinda stressing about this.&nbsp; I transferred BTC out of SR into the Fog, and so far only 1/4 of my transfer has showed up. I can&#039;t find anything on blockchain confirming that my coins are on the way. It&#039;s been 8 hours since I transferred out of SR. How long did it take for your deposits to show up?

Tumbling involves a lot of transactions which need to be confirmed by the network. Prolonging that is also part of the tumbling to avoid linking the split up bitcoins back together.

The time varies. Something went wrong with your withdrawal.<br /><br />Did you use just one bitcoin address? If so, I can&#039;t explain what happened, but something is not right. Message SR vendor support, then message bitcoinfog support. But don&#039;t dawdle, do it now.<br /><br />goblin

				No I used 3 different addresses and used the &#039;autowithdraw&#039; feature.&nbsp; I have since disabled autowithdraw until I resolve this problem.&nbsp; I have messaged BitcoinFog 3 times over the past 24 hours, and still no response.&nbsp; I&#039;ll give SR Vendor support a try.

If so, did you make sure not to delete any of them before you sent coins to them? Once you delete a fog address, it doesn&#039;t exist anymore for any purpose.

				Yes all three addresses were on bitcoinfog.&nbsp; I did not delete them, I just disabled the autowithdraw feature.
