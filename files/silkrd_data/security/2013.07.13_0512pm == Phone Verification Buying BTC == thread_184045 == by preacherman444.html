				I&#039;ve been trying to buy BTC for 2 weeks or so now (wish I would have got them when they were cheaper). I can&#039;t find a Localbitcoins vendor that does a bank deposit without requiring phone verification. Are people doing this with their own cell phones? Seems a little sketchy. Do I really have to get a burner phone just for buying BTC? I don&#039;t want it in my phone records that I&#039;ve been buying BTC though, in case I ever got a warrant for my records. What is everybody else doing?<br /><br />I just bought some BTC that are in escrow because the listing didn&#039;t say anything about a phone but now I have to text to get the account information.

				Nobody eh? That&#039;s alright. It looks like I can get a burner phone for about 15 bucks so I&#039;m just going to do that.

				You&#039;re not anonymous if you link your BTC to your bank account. I assume you want to be anonymous cos you&#039;re using a burner phone.

				Weird, I used localbitcoins earlier and did a bank deposit, no interaction between us required at all except for me leaving feedback.

				i dunno if he means the bank calling him to confirm the transaction. i went to buy my first btc last week and went to do a bank transfer. as i went to enter the details i noticed it said &#039;we will need to call you, are your numbers up to date&#039;. i got a new phone number a few months back and forgot to change my number with my bank and so couldn&#039;t get my btc, all because of this. the bank won&#039;t allow transactions for 3 days after a number change.<br /><br />i also used localbitcoin and in the end i just went into my local branch of the sellers bank and paid it into his account over the counter. it was even more instant than an online bank transfer. i&#039;m in the UK tho, but ask the sellers in your country if its possible to do the same.

I should have used the words bank deposit instead of bank transfer. From what I know you don&#039;t need an account nor an ID to deposit money into somebody&#039;s bank account. So it would be anonymous right? Phone number that isn&#039;t tied to me and method of payment that isn&#039;t tied to me.<br /><br />All the sellers on Localbitcoins seem to be requiring a phone confirmation to complete the deposit or to get the deposit information.<br /><br />I&#039;ll check to see if there are one&#039;s that don&#039;t require a phone right now.

Each phone has a ID number (think its called a idmei or something like that number that ID&#039;s the phone it self) so you when you cycle burners dont just cycle the sim but the phone it self!
