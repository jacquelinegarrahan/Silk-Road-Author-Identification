				Newbie here with a question.<br /><br />Is a Bank desposit to Getbitcoin&gt;Instawallet&gt;SR?&nbsp; feasible?&nbsp; <br /><br />or do i have to use MTGOX as well?&nbsp; I was reading The Complete All-in-One Guide on How to Anonymously Use Silk Road, and it said i needed a Mt Gox account.&nbsp; What is the point of this if i can just do Getbitcoin&gt;Instawallet&gt;SR?<br /><br />Thanks

				You don&#039;t need to use Mt Gox. Bank deposit to GetBitcoin to instawallet to SR will be fine. You should probably put it through a few instawallets under a few different Tor ID&#039;s.

				With a bank deposit yeah just use a few instawallets and you&#039;re done, not much point in using a mixer unless you are dealing large amounts and just want to be on the safer side. Mixers as far as I know are for ways which do reveal your identity some way along the line, a mixer will essentially swap your coins for someone elses and have random deposits/withdrawals, making it really hard to follow a bitcoin timeline.

				MT Gox is the exchange where currency can be exchanged for BTC, now there are various methods of getting Currency into MT Gox and even more methods of getting BTC out.

				You should use Bitinstant instead of get-bitcoin. Get-bitcoin has quite a few accusations of selective scamming and very often take longer than their 24 hour &quot;guarantee&quot;. If they do take longer than 24 hours, they will still charge you their service fee unless you harass them about it.

				This stuff confuses the &amp;%$#@! outta me. I used to use E-Gold, till everyone stopped using it, so I know about going to the bank, making a deposit into the exchangers bank account and then having them transfer that into my E-Gold acct. What I don&#039;t understand mostly about bitcoin, is how the &amp;%$#@! after I make a bank deposit into an exchangers account is the money going to magically appear the next time I log into SR, after I tell them my account number given from SR.<br /><br />Wait, maybe I get it..... Bitinstant bank deposit &gt; Mt. Gox &gt; private wallet running behind Tor &gt; SR ? ? ? ?<br /><br /><br />So there are no reliable vendors on SR for bitcoin direct to your username or acct # or whatever ? you always get screwed or every 5 out of 10 times you try ? 50-50 Russian roulette ?<br /><br />Would I be better off taking a gun to my head, than attempt to use one of the SR bitcoin vendors ?

Now after I go through the process and finally send it to my SR provided address it will magically appear there&nbsp; as credited ? I don&#039;t understand how SR is going to receive my coins and credit me, unless it is connected to this outside network. Isn&#039;t that the whole point of TOR and SR ? to NOT be connected to the outside world ? I also don&#039;t understand this escrow thing and finalizing early. <br /><br />Ok, so I see something I want, I add it to cart and ........ well i guess i&#039;ll find out what happens next when I actually have money to spend, and go through the process.<br /><br />Are there any trustworthy marijuana vendors US based, that have been here for a year or more ? I heard of some crazy shit, like growers that are sick in the head and out to hurt people, like spraying WD-40 on your weed before sending it ( DR. Green ) &lt;------ anyone remember him ? I don&#039;t want mind altering substances or unnecessary chemicals sprayed on my weed, I just want something that the vendor grows themselves preferably and possibly a medical grower who sells their extras here. No genetically engineered stuff or garbage. I miss TFM, they just put up a DEA page a couple days ago, so the site is completely gone now when you put in the address. I had alot of guys I could trust in the past 7 or so years and hope it can continue here. I have been in the game as a buyer since doobiedude, if anyone remembers him, i never bought off him though, was too smart. I thought reading the indictment that just the guys that programmed the site and ran it, and the paypal and other money receivers and transferees only got busted and the vendors for just weed were fine ( for now at least ) but I see they made 7 more arrests so maybe the vendors too. Don&#039;t know, but I miss those guys, they were all very good people. <br /><br />

				Johnny bare with me this will be a long response....<br /><br /><br />1. Once you get your coins whether it through Mtgox dwolla or any other of the millions ways you will want to send it through a Ewallet. I used Instantwallet.org and its simple and easy. Just a heads up once your money shows up in the wallet it takes about 20-45 minutes to be able to transfer them out.&nbsp; In this case you can either send them directly to your SR address or send them to a tumble service(bitcoinfog) The tumble service is a extra layer of security. Some ppl use it some ppl dont. When its just small change I just use a ewallet and than deposit it to my SR. <br /><br />2.Dont worry about sending the coins to your SR address. As long as you send the coins to the right address it will SHOW up in your account. Just be patient and it will come. Sometimes it takes a few hours to see the money in your account. <br /><br />3. The escrow system is put in place to protect the buyer. Once you obtain enough sales on the site (around 5 sales) you will not have to Finalize early (FE) on most order. However if your buying weight (oz and up) some sellers will ask you to FE.&nbsp; FE is used with some vendors, look at there home page to see there policy. Most sellers will have you FE until you reach there requirement. This is to show your not a scammer and will run off without paying for the product. <br /><br />4. There are plently of reliable vendor on here. WHEN IN DOUBT look them up here on the forums. There are plenty of review threads to looks at. I really havent heard about ppl spraying shit. Some notable U.S Cannabis Vendors are NorCal420, Happy420Smoke,tweeb and mr.humbolt(sp?) Stick with these vendor and youll be fine. <br /><br /><br />I Hope this answers most of your questions and Welcome to the SilkRoad. Enjoy your stay :D <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Keeponsmiling

				So basically i will be opening Bitinstant and Mt. Gox accounts online without TOR and use an email address not my own but one that I can access. And I will get a bitcoin address # from all these separate parties ? Now I can&#039;t keep all these numbers pasted somewhere on my computer otherwise if i get popped and they take my pc it will all be there. Well I just downloaded a bitcoin wallet program to my PC and I see I got an address to use in there too obviously, does this number change or it&#039;s unique to the pc it opened on and stays the same ? has anyone ever screwed up or lost track of there bitcoin address and lost all their money or it somehow mysteriously disappeared ? LOL
