				A bunch of people have private messaged me wondering why this thread was deleted, they seem to think it may be because I mentioned that there are thousands of people who have been arrested for getting drugs in the mail, and that this may scare people away from placing orders and have a chilling effect on noobs.<br /><br />I would like to think it got moved to a moderation forum where they are now discussing adding an intelligence subforum like I suggested, for pooling law enforcement documentation / case studies / research papers etc related to online drug trafficking and such. But who knows. I do know that I don&#039;t like to see entire threads censored though, particularly without just locking them and giving an explanation.

Entire drug forums have been brought down in federal operations, for example in Operation Raw Deal the DEA compromised the poorly implemented encryption system of Hushmail and harvested addresses of vendors and customers, then raided several dozen people. There was also Operation Web Tryp which targeted research chemical vendors and some customers were visited by feds but I don&#039;t think any were charged. Then there was DZF which was an FBI operated sting forum. Then there are several cases of individual vendors and customers being arrested after interceptions / being snitched on by competition etc. Many of these cases have information on them which is useful for learning from the mistakes of others. Not to mention there is a wealth of intelligence to be gathered from law enforcement documents and other things.<br /><br />Keep in mind that even though I know personally over a dozen people who have been arrested for drug charges linked to the internet, that&nbsp; I have been involved with groups that buy/sell drugs on the internet for about a decade now. There are many many more cases of people being arrested for getting drugs in the mail without a clear link to the internet, statistics show that every year the USPI arrests around two thousand people for getting drugs in the mail (if we had an intelligence forum I would dump a few dozen USPI documents with these sorts of statistics and case studies in them). This does not include people who are arrested by the DEA or ICE. Usually these are larger orders, but many have been arrested for personal use orders also. Of course you want to learn from others mistakes, that is why almost every single forum has an intelligence or at least news section for the gathering and analysis of this sort of information (of course most forums are community oriented and not aimed at making a profit for anyone in particular). I find it very strange that when I say the only reason SR wouldn&#039;t have such a subforum is because they are worried it will scare people away from using SR and hurt their profit margins, that the entire thread almost instantly vanishes without a single reason being given. I also can not seem to get any response about adding an intelligence sub forum no matter how many times I mention it. It would be a shame if profit is more important than security, let alone free speech. I will still keep my hopes up that it was merely moved to a mod only section, but honestly if the mods here are going to delete my security posts (and the entire threads that they are made in) when people being secure is counter to SR making money, I will not be sticking around here for much longer.

				I 2nd this. As a newb, it would be nice to have a subforum on SAFETY &amp; SECURITY. But as was stated in my thread asking for such a thing, it seems as though NOT having an SOP is what keeps it secure. I was told if everyone went by a SOP, then SR would be compromised more easily. But it&#039;s also very hard to decipher all the information from all the slurry, and even harder to know what&#039;s right or wrong, with all the argumentation. <br />I feel that any censorship is wrong. <br />

Safety and security should include things like computer security tutorials etc. Intelligence should include law enforcement documents, academic papers on the tools we are using, news stories related to what we are doing, case studies, etc. Mixing news stories in with the technical security forum is a good way to have a disorganized mess that nobody feels like contributing to or sorting through.

				So DZF was a sting! I&#039;d dropped out of online drug land before that though a lot of people were pretty confident of the fact already at that stage. I&#039;ve only just signed up here but yeah it is pretty fucked that a thread about security issues would be deleted. <br /><br />I have no idea what Silk Road is like yet or who the admin is, but if the logic that the thread was deleted because it would damage profit margins is true then that is a pretty short term plan. Yeah you might stop people from being informed for a while and keep your transaction volume but most likely there are a lot of intelligent fuckers here who could use such info, or the stimulus provided by such info, to increase the overall security of the system. That would preserve the transaction volume in the long run, and in general be a much cooler way to go about business.

				lol im sittin here clicking the show posts replied to and the you can be monitored or whatever topic never come back up... lol idk but i will say that there are too many smart people giving le too many good ideas. SR you a wonderful place but i think you guys can do better. i think forums should be minimized to simple vendor rating and a list of do&#039;s, dont&#039;s, otherwise the community is going to destroy its self

				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />It&#039;s seriously disturbing to me that the A&amp;P thread was just removed like that, with no explanation. Any chiefs care to explain to us indians wtf that&#039;s all about? That&#039;s a huge red flag to me...I just can&#039;t get over it. Security should be the foremost consideration here and related ideas should be widely disseminated. My confidence is getting shakier by the day here, to say the least...
