				I&#039;m going to be needing to turn an amount over 10,000$ into bitcoins here in the next few days.<br /><br /><br />I would like to use bitinstant but they cap out at $2,000 worth of deposits a day. I wouldnt mind waiting about&nbsp; a week doing deposits every day at different locations but im more so worried if Bitinstant or MTGox would find this amount of bitcoin suspicious and flag me in any way<br /><br />If Bitinstant doesnt seem like the best route, what would be? Are vendors such as Sugar Mama able to fill an order out like that?<br />Bitcoins are a piece of cake but moving this amount seems a bit difficult.<br /><br />Thanks

				Wouldn&#039;t you be able to use like 5 different accounts? I mean I&#039;ve never had to do that but it seems like it would work.&nbsp; Im not sure if they can catch or not but if you havent done it maybe its worth a try

				you need to use different mt gox accounts i believe, at least two or else you will face the anti-money laundering laws. where if you run more than around 10k through they will make you verify your identity and a bunch of legal stuff before you can access the money<br /><br />might be wrong but please look into it first<br /><br />it may be better to just use the straight to btc address instead of funding mt gox as mentioned

				Might just put my trust into Sugar Mama for this one.<br /><br />Wont put all my eggs into one basket though. Id rather pass over a couple money paks at a time. worst that would happen is getting ripped off like 1k or something. But I dont see Sugar Mama as running away...then again its alot of money haha

				Some people sell Bitcoins for cash in person. Perhaps find a few different ones close by? (clearnet link warning): https://localbitcoins.com<br /><br />I&#039;d probably structure (ooooo, bad illegal word the IRS likes to use) my transactions by using a combination of MtGox (if I was verified only), Bitinstant, and cash in person deals. Dunno if you can pull it off &quot;in a few days&quot; without arousing suspicion, though.<br /><br />
