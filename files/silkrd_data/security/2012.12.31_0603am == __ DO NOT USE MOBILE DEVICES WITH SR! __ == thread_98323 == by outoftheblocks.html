				Directly from SR support...<br /><br />&quot;However, I HIGHLY recommend that you ONLY get on from actual computers and not phones or other mobile devices. Tor is not meant to work with these and there is NO guarantee for ANY anonymity on those devices.&quot;<br /><br />This should be noted and heed by anyone who wants to be naughty while walking to their job instead at the home computer. <br /><br />Keep it simple. Do not overdo it. Dont log into anything on cells.

				Your anonymity is never guaranteed.<br /><br />Besides possibly the program you are using to connect to the network being malware or something...How is it any less safe? You are still connecting to the same network. I am genuinely curious as im not especially tech savvy.<br /><br /><br />( Sr using the word &quot;I&quot; is sort of strange at leastt ive never seen them say it)

				Theres no fucking way he hacked my SR account to change the senders name somehow and include it in past converations that I have had with support. The past messages were tacked on the bottom of the screen about orders that needed finalizing and an order that had been canceled. <br />&nbsp;

				if you know what you are doing, i dont see any reason why you cant access tor from your android device. accessing tor via orbot and orweb on a prepaid android phone is probably safer than accessing it from your at home internet connection, with the exception that im not sure there is a good pgp app for android yet. other than that, it would be a bitch if your phone fell into LEO hands, as there is no secure way to lock any phone. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98323.msg693726#msg693726">Quote from: CrazyBart on December 31, 2012, 06:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your anonymity is never guaranteed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1

				Can someone maybe Pin this?? I mean it to be more of a billboard. I think it is a large problem if almost half of US people own Smart Phones.....Dont want people getting fucked over.<br />At least in the US the govt is protected by Roving wire taps and other taping ways which allow LE to trace you over any service or cell service or company which you visit. NOW FB is required to hand over info if LE asks for it. Same with google, apple, ect. On top of that, MANY LARGE COMPANIES just changed their privacy policies which say they can record everything attached to their clients, Chrome, safari, IE.&nbsp; The LE they have the possibility of reading your texts, emails, calls and anything else which may be connected to you. MANY PHONES are signed into to use them. android to google, IOS to apple. Simple recording and monitoring of everything.<br /><br />I dont mean to be a sketch ball. I have met DEA agents, They are not the genius trackers we think of. The government love to spend money with wild things and big toys. They like breaking in houses doing a big bust cause it causes a ruckus. Then they get to tell stories about it to their kids like war stories. All about that dream. WE all just stimulate the econemy a bit for all the people living IRL.!<br />

				that article had nothing to do with using tor, but it was pretty accurate. prepaid android phone. replace it regularly with a new handset and new account. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98323.msg693807#msg693807">Quote from: CrazyBart on December 31, 2012, 07:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98323.msg693767#msg693767">Quote from: Wadozo on December 31, 2012, 06:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98323.msg693746#msg693746">Quote from: fyg on December 31, 2012, 06:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if you know what you are doing, i dont see any reason why you cant access tor from your android device. accessing tor via orbot and orweb on a prepaid android phone is probably safer than accessing it from your at home internet connection, with the exception that im not sure there is a good pgp app for android yet. other than that, it would be a bitch if your phone fell into LEO hands, as there is no secure way to lock any phone. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98323.msg693726#msg693726">Quote from: CrazyBart on December 31, 2012, 06:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Your anonymity is never guaranteed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are plenty of reasons accessing SR through a mobile device is NOT SAFE!

(Java driveby&#039;s, javascript exploits etc). As I&#039;ve said previously, this issue was covered extensively by Guru, who in my opinion, was a very knowledgeable tech head. I read through his posts (prior to them being deleted) on more than one occasion and his thoughts made complete sense to me. He has been correct on every occasion where he pointed out someone&#039;s mis-information being posted (on the threads I read) and I have no reason to doubt him here. Even forum member, outoftheblocks, got a response from SR Support about accessing SR from a mobile device through Tor mobile, which says - <br /><br />Directly from SR support...<br /><br />&quot;However, I HIGHLY recommend that you ONLY get on from actual computers and not phones or other mobile devices. Tor is not meant to work with these and there is NO guarantee for ANY anonymity on those devices.&quot;<br /><br />Do as you please, it is your choice to make after all. However, I wont be risking anything, especially with the response given by SR Staff.<br />
