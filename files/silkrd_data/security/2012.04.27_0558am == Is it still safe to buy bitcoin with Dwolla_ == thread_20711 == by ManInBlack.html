				I want to use Dwolla to buy bitcoin but Dwolla now requires SSN verification. Is this a problem? Should I be worried? Do people still use Dwolla with MtGox? Or Dwolla for BTC purchases at all?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />-MIB

				That&#039;s up to you, but I myself wouldn&#039;t give out my SSN to anyone (unless I was getting a loan or something). I would suggest using bitinstant.com or one of the other methods. Honestly, nothing will probably happen if you give Dwolla your SSN, but I personally wouldn&#039;t take that chance when there are plenty of other (and much quicker) ways of getting bitcoins now.

				Bitinstant is definitely the way to go. I have used it 3 times now all in the past week or two. You can get coins in silk road within a couple of hours. Quick bank deposit (no id needed) and funds can instantly be put in mtgox.

I only use Dwolla now to cash out bitcoins but I&#039;m already looking for an alternative because they have been delaying payments recently.

				There is no one here who still uses Dwolla to buy bitcoin though? I also think that BitInstant would be the way to go! Although I do not have any where within 100 miles to direct deposit the cash. Is there any other feasible way? I have pretty much eliminated in person bank deposits since I would have to travel hours round trip just to make the drop. Any other advice is greatly appreciated.<br />-MIB

You can also do moneypak to BTC and just find a trusted vendor that does that service here on SR.

				What makes it safer being a buyer? When you say &quot;between wallets&quot;, do you mean ewallets? If I tumble them through a few ewallets, do they take a percentage of BTC along the way? With all the taxing of obtaining BTC, anonymizing BTC, and spending BTC I&#039;m losing a fair percentage of original staring cash. If the ewallets are a free service, then that would be the way to go.<br />-MIB

				BitcoinFog takes 1-3% randomly for each transaction, probably more likely 3% for higher btc transactions but still for the price of anonymity I can afford 3$ for every 100$.. plus drugs are often cheaper on here than in the real world.

				I moved 2500 USD through Dwolla and on to Mt Gox before they started asking me for a photocopy of a photo ID. They suggested my driver’s license as a good example. I simply ignore that and my Mt Gox account now. I never used the bitcoin traffic from them for anything other than just moving stuff around, and parking it in wallets. Just playing around actually. I had read about their nature of enthusiastic cooperation with officialdom. If I was going to purchase contraband, I needed a little more anonymity in the bitcoin trail. <br /><br />That’s when I gave Bitinstant.com a try. I decided to go full stealth with this one, and didn’t use any internet access that could be traced to me. Deposited money in person at a bank and retrieved BTC via tormail. Did that a number of times so as to not make one big-ass deposit. Yeah, it’s a bit pricey, but a whole lot closer to anonymity than the other methods I’ve yet to come up with or read about.<br />
