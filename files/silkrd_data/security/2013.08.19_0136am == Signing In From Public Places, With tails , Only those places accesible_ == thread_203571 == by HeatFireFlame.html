				Ok so my title did not make much sense. But let me try and explain further.<br />To sign in to my vendor account I always use public places, And I only ever sign in from home on this account. Now what I am asking is this.<br /><br />Is it counter productive to do so? For instance, if I am signing In via public places to hide my tails usage from my ISP, Is it stupid to sign in to an account that is not my vendor one from home as well, Seeing as it would still show my ISP I am accesing tor, possibly tails if analyzed? <br /><br />Because I presume that they could not tell which account you were signing in from anyway? No I highly doubt it.<br />thanks

				Since they cant, in theory, tell where in Tor you go from home, if they investigate you or people using Tor in your area, they may still think you are of interest. In other words, unless they know where the vendor logged in from, they can&#039;t tell you are not that vendor they are hunting. So, I think using tor at home has risks about helping LE get probable cause to search your location. Very circumstantial though. They would need something more to connect you. To be safer, take steps to be sure you don&#039;t get caught with a Tails &quot;persistant&quot; volume with data about the vendor on it.<br /><br />PC -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor seems like the smart strategy so your ISP does not know you visit Tor. Buy VPN service with Btc anon.. See astor&#039;s &quot;lets talk about security&quot; thread for getting serious about it.<br />I don&#039;t know if this site is safe or their advice, but I would probably choose a VPN from this list:<br />https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/
