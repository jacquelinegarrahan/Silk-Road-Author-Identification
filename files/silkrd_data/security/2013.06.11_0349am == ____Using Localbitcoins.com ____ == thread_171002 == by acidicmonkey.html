				+1 an absolute savior! I can&#039;t believe this site isn&#039;t more well-known. Easily the safest method I&#039;ve used. Hopefully we can keep it quiet enough, so people don&#039;t start over using it and make the rates go up even more.<br /><br />Literally just walked in and bought BTC from a dude my age. Uses &quot;Half Baked&quot; technique in remembering his customers, ie Blackass! or as in my case, &quot;Giants Hat&quot;.So there&#039;s no record of names, no paper trail, nothing. You are able to monitor the transaction via blockchain.info, and I received my funds within 2 hours (he processed it as I stood there). <br /><br />I just contacted the guy directly, and we bypassed the actual site for both of our fiduciary benefits. That way there is no percentage taken out of his end when he withdraws, and reduces our (the buyers) fees to that of BitInstant. <br /><br />So again... I highly recommend giving LocalBitcoins a shot. It has so far been the smoothest, most efficient BTC transaction I&#039;ve made on the Road.<br /><br />Turp

				I was curious what the average percent fee you guys on average are paying on what amount?<br /><br />I email chatted with a seller this week but didn&#039;t get any coins yet.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t because on the small amount I needed at the time ($85) I would have paid ~$127/coin when they were listing at $110 at the time.<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely going to be looking into it the next time I need coins, but wanted to ask all of you what fees (%) you are being charged.<br /><br />ThAnks.

				Typically the fee&#039;s associated with the transaction are already factored into their BTC prices- this is why different vendors have different prices. Frankly, it&#039;s just easier to get BTC in some locations that others, mostly due to banking access. In an area with multiple vendors the fee&#039;s drop dramatically. The free-market system has been extremely successful in this regard.<br /><br />On average, my local vendor charges 5-7% which turns our to be much cheaper than many of the alternatives (fuck you bitinstant), not to mention the transaction immediately shows on blockchain.<br /><br />Most smart vendors meet in an area that has WiFi availble (ie. coffee shops, panera, etc.) so if you have a laptop they welcome you to bring it with you. As I stated before, the transaction shows up immediately on blockchain, and once in blockchain it&#039;s out of the vendors hands. Then just wait for blockchain to do its thing and presto in about 30 minutes you have all of your coins. This is wayyy more convenient than waiting hours to finally see your BTC transaction process.<br /><br />The reason there is a lack of feedback is because it&#039;s rare that anybody actually uses LocalBitcoins.com for the actual transaction. Really, LocalBitcoins just gives you the ability to network with local vendors. Once you meet with the vendor there is typically no talk of LBTC (cheaper for everyone). So there is never really a record of an actual &quot;transaction&quot; per se on LBTC to review. Not to mention most people who use BTC are lazy and afraid to associate their name with their transactions, which is fine, but let&#039;s all remember that buying BTC is legal. It&#039;s what you do with those BTC that can get you in trouble.<br /><br />So I wouldn&#039;t be shy, but make sure you meet in a public place. Of course there will be some big assholes out there that might try to scam you, so do your due dilligence and protect yourself. Luckily most people associated with BTC are computer geeks like myself and pose no threat whatsoever. Just in case however, meet in public with your your computer or phone to confirm any transactions- and as always... NO NAMES. Can&#039;t stress that enough NO. NAMES. EVER. If the vendor has their phone number listed on LBTC, use a Google number to contact them just in case. You can never overprotect yourself or your money from LE.<br /><br />Anyway, I think I addressed most of the questions here. If you have any more or if there&#039;s something I missed let me know and I will try and assist you. After jumping through hoops for so long LBTC seems almost &quot;too easy to be true&quot; but I&#039;ve used it on numerous occasions and have never been burnt once. But you also can&#039;t be stupid about it. Remember they are making money off of each transaction, so they benefit when you benefit. <br /><br />Hope this helps-<br /><br />Turp

				I had someone outside this website tell me about localbitcoins and i just went on and it looks really nice. It also looks like they<br />don&#039;t charge ridiculous fees like mtgox. I&#039;m going to see how it works and in a few weeks, buy some coins from there. I also like<br />how you can do the cash deposit at banks. That&#039;s my favorite way of buying bitcoins I think.

				For those buying bitcoins via bank transfer, are you concerned at all about the lack of anonymity since you are using an account that presumably has your name attached to it?<br /><br />I would prefer to do a transfer since it seems the simplest method but I guess I would prefer to make the trade as anonymous as possible.

				Had my first transaction with LocalBitcoin yesterday and it went smooth as fuck. Didn&#039;t have many local sellers so I went with an online seller and did a cash bank deposit. Took about 20 minutes after I confirmed the transaction to get the coins in my wallet, not bad at all. <br /><br />BitInstant had been working well for me so I never even looked into Localbitcoins. I thought it was only local face to face transactions, had no clue there was an online option. Probably won&#039;t be using Bitinstant if it ever does come back online, they probably lost a lot of business shutting down the way they did.

				Okay, I may not be adding much new information, but I just completed my first &quot;cash deposit&quot; transaction (definitely my preferred method and I pretty much try to avoid all others). I used to use bitinstant until that all fell apart, and localbitcoins is by far easier to use and faster.<br /><br />There are some local meet up options for me less than 10 minutes from my place, and one day I might do that. But I simply sorted by &quot;All US online sellers&quot; found some that allowed for cash deposits within my limits, placed the order, went and made the deposit, and the BTC was in my account in less than 15 minutes.<br /><br />Again, localbitcoins is far and away better than any other method of purchasing bitcoins I&#039;ve ever used.

				The first time I bought a Bitcoin, I used LocalBitCoins.com. I don&#039;t drive, and had a friend take me to get the MoneyGram placed. Well, I took too long, and the transaction timed out. The seller, &quot;Josh&quot;, had given me his phone number (just a GoogleVoice number, easy to ignore/replace... impossible to track). He answered right away though and told me not to worry. He transferred the coins directly to my SR Wallet for me. I used him again, and this time he wanted payment via GreenDot MoneyPack (cheaper than MG or WU). I told him how much I wanted, and went and got the card. Then, I got distracted, and had to leave for work (we were working outside of LBC.com since I trusted him). I got home, hoping he was still up and not annoyed. The coins were in my SR Wallet ALREADY!!! I&#039;m a good, decent human being (as he was to me), so I quickly got him the code for his funds. He had misunderstood the amount I put on the GD, but promptly transferred the difference to me.<br /><br />Awesome guy, but his prices are high as he&#039;s out of the country right now.<br /><br />Anyways, LBC.com is THE SHIT!<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				My first LB trade went through without any problems. The transaction was about as easy as things get, and the exchange rate was very good.<br /><br />Here in the UK, it&#039;s not that easy to obtain coins confidentially. But this method was just so easy. A quick glance through LB to find someone online and willing to trade with somebody with no stats and who was offering a good rate, then a quick message along with my order. The guy was super helpful too. I made a note of his bank account and went into town to make a cash deposit. Untraceable transaction. Thank you LB. If anyone wants a reliable and trusted cash deposit trader on LB, pm me.

				Can I ask why if given the option would you meet local as opposed to making a cash deposit? I have done the cash deposit method many times and it is fast, convenient and fairly anonymous.<br /><br />Why add the extra factor of meeting someone. Gotta love Localbitcoin though, so far the best system in the last 2 years that I have used. <br /><br />Speed is on par with the best past systems, but the prices can&#039;t be beat. Shit many times I&#039;m paying considerably less than the current MTGox price.<br /><br />While BTCKing and BlueSky (and numerous other past vendors)were good and at the time and possibly the most convenient, their fees reflected that.<br /><br />many times you had to factor in another 8-12% to cover their cost. Not anymore and that&#039;s a good thing, right Martha?!?<br /><br />

				Finally got on the localbitcoin wagon today. Picked the trader with the highest rating locally, and thankfully was only a 15 minute drive to meet up with him (in his bank parking lot, haha). The network was super slow today, but from his great communication I gave him the cash anyways while escrow was being finalized. Nice getting some extra coin over what I would have paid at btcquick.

Do we Just look at the price of BTC next to the sellers page?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I believe sellers usually just make an advert and set a price or formula for what price they charge per Bitcoin. They can choose any price they want to charge. You look at the adds and see what their current price per coin is. You can begin to make an order for however many coins you want to buy. Then, if you read your offer details before you finalize the offer, the LBC details of your transaction can be seen with what price you are paying per coin. You then compare that price to Mt Gox or SR&#039;s value to see how it compares. I think the LBC site charges 1% (on any deal that goes through their system) and they charge the advertiser that fee. Going through their system on a face to face makes the deal happen nearly instantly with no waiting for the blockchain. If you cancel any deal on LBC and just meet for a trade, you can do it outside the LBC system and save the advertiser that 1%, but you then have to wait for the blockchain to have the coins.<br />If you do an online type purchase, there is an escrow system with another fee attached (if you use the LBC escrow system). I don&#039;t remember what the escrow fee is or who it gets charged to, but, I&#039;m sure that info is easy to find on the LBC site.<br />Face to face meetings:<br />Phone? No one needs a phone as far as I know. It just makes you look more reliable to be verified. In a face to face, one person needs a smartphone or computer to tell the LBC site to transfer the coins. I think it is best that the buyer of coins have that so they can be checking to be sure they got the coins. If the buyer and seller both want to be anonymous and do not want to use a smartphone to send an sms message, then the seller may need a computer to use Tor to access their account to finalize the transfer. Seller should not use the buyers computer to log into LBC - though that would work in theory. Not all LBC traders care about being anonymous. So, some don&#039;t mind using their smartphone to send the SMS message. The coin seller has a code to send to LBC via SMS to finalize. I don&#039;t know if that code can also be used by a buyer to finalize on LBC using a computer logged into the buyers account. I&#039;d guess there is a way to do that so the seller does not need a smartphone or computer.<br />Online deals/adverts:<br />Phone? I dont know. Don&#039;t think so though.

				Woah, I&#039;m surprised this would come up, I thought it was kinda known around here already. When starting my journey on the road it&#039;s the first thing that popped up in my quest for anon BTC and have been using it ever since. It&#039;s great, all you need is 2 smartphones and cash. You can even use the scan codes with the vendor, perfect.<br /><br />But as peeps have been stressing out, always remain anon and go on the site with a vpn or tor. Never give your name to the vendor. And don&#039;t always buy from the same guy, he might be astonished by your need for so many coins...<br />I literally wouldn&#039;t know how to source for btc otherwise lol

				yeah, when meeting in person they have to fund it so it can be released. you get a code that they dont know. once they release the coins they get the code, tell it to you and you&#039;re good to go.<br />if you verified your phone# you will get a text instantly once coins are released.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t really like LBC tbh. Especially as a BTC seller. People are really flakey and unresponsive most of the time and it&#039;s a huge crapshoot for any sort of stable or consistent exchange. Two days ago, I put 25 BTC in escrow for a posted buyer on LBC and got no response and had to have admin put my money back in my wallet. Yea, and admin took over 24 hours to resolve the dispute. Not a great experience in my book.

				You only need to use escrow when paying through a bank transfer or other non-face to face way. No different from SR.<br /><br />If you do meet face to face then all you need to do is go through the LBC system. Have the seller fund the transaction just before you meet. Then all he has to do is release the funds into your temp LBC wallet after you hand over your cash. You&#039;ll get a text message with your private confirmation code (known only to you before the trade is done) confirming that the coins are in your temp wallet. Or if you don&#039;t want to list your cell number in the LBC system then you can just meet at a place that has wifi and login to your LBC account directly to confirm the transfer.<br /><br />Very very simple, quick and easy. Not to mention safe. Both sides are protected using the LBC system and for only a 1% fee.

				If anyone wants about $50-200BTC a week via PayPal, I usually need a paypal USD balance of $200 every week for some business expenses. I would prefer to have recurring customers tho so I can build trust, although most people are trustworthy.<br /><br />Anyone who want&#039;s to do this (I sold all my BTC from last week on the weekend, so none til tomorrow), PM me on SR. You will be Invoiced for &quot;Enterprise Risk Management Services&quot; or similar, which I don&#039;t believe offers buyer protection since my business is verified, and services can&#039;t be reproduced to prove their incompletion. <br /><br />You will be given the right to leave feedback on my EMT listing (ignore the Canadian bank details - you can mention PayPal in feedback too) and on my vendor profile. Simply order 1 transfer for $0 and I&#039;ll accept, allowing you to finalize and leave a review of your experience. Money must be paid to me first, and if you don&#039;t trust me that&#039;s fine, you don&#039;t have to give me money lol. I wouldn&#039;t take 5K cash if it was sent before I closed my end of the deal. I don&#039;t wanna be fucked around with so expect to be treated the same :)

Recently, though, Mt Gox rates have been higher than you can sell Btc for anywhere else due, as I understand it, to Problems getting USD out of Gox in the USA (high demand for BTC on Gox by people who have to spend USD on Btc to get the USD out of their Gox account - and - Low Btc supply on Gox as no one from the USA should be selling Btc on Mt Gox unless they don&#039;t care about getting the USD out of Gox). So, Btc sellers may be looking at the lower rates at other exchanges when they choose a price to offer.

				Purchasing coins with a debit or credit card isn&#039;t really a good idea as you don&#039;t have anonymity. There are sites where you can do this, but I&#039;d assume they would require some sort of id check. Maybe you could use western union?

But, if you really want to, you might use the card to get cash at your card&#039;s bank/atm and then use the cash to deposit as discussed above or you might ask a LBC vendor that is selling coins if they know how to do that. If they accept deposits at the bank that matches your card, that might be easiest.

I feel that LE is mostly interested in people selling Btc on LBC. I could be wrong about that though. If you really don&#039;t want LE or the IRS to be able to link you to LBC transactions, then maybe a burner phone that is not linked to your true identity. You would probably have to ONLY use it for LBC, and, I think they could still triangulate your location even if you turn off the GPS tracking system (smart phones have on by default).

				Just used LocalBitcoins. Great experience.<br /><br />Very easy and very quick. I think I paid less than 3% overhead compared to SR at the time.<br />I will be using this service again, for sure.
