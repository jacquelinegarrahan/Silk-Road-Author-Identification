				Using PayPal: Use https://planetwm.com/exchange/ and exchange your PayPal for other webmoney. There is usually an incubation period where you have to wait x amount of days. <br />Alternately, request a bank withdrawal from your PayPal account into your bank account. Then simply fund your Mt. Gox/Instersango account using Dwolla or a direct BT respectively. I notice that you need them FAST so both of the methods I mentioned probably will not be for you.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Using your CC: If you are DESPERATE: Withdraw cash from the ATM using your CC and pay the &quot;Cash Advance&quot; fee. Then, using the money you withdrew, buy a Moneypak, or use Western Union / Moneygram and send your cash to a trusted vendor like BTCPal, BTCKing, or Googleyed ( I can vouch on the behalf of all three). <br /><br /><br />----<br />Voila: BTC.&nbsp; :-*<br />----<br /><br />I hope I helped you out.<br /><br />Zeus

				Getting Bitcoins is a huge pain in the ass until you do it once. Its really not that hard. If you are just here for one or two purchases than you can go with a trusted btc vendor. I recommend BTCKing because i have experience with him and trust him, but there are many available.<br /><br />BTCKing and vendors like him will have the BTC in your account within minutes of following his or her easy directions. The only problem is they charge a 10% price increase. <br /><br />If you have a little patience, which btw if your new is totally necessary here on sr, you can set up your bank account with a site like dwolla. It takes a week or so for the money to become available, but once it goes through you can transfer it to a site like MT.GOX and then to a few instawallets or bitcoin wallets before transfering it to your SR address. Its not hard at all but requires patience. <br /><br />Good luck and remember that patience is not just a virtue here on the road but a necessity!
