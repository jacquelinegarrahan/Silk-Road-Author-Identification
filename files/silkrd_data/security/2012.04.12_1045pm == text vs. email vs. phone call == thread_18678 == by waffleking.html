				just trying to get an opinion on how people would rank the security of each of those options:<br /><br />text vs. email vs. phone call<br /><br />obviously never talk about SR outside of these forums or on any of those, but when talking drug talk in general, which method is the safest and which is the least safe?&nbsp; talking non-encrypted e-mail/text here.<br /><br />thanks for the input!

				I would say that emailing someone through tormail through tor and encryption is light-years more secure than any phone connected to a contract or text message, say you are a target phone tap and getting warrants for anything under your name would be the first thing <br /><br />even if you have a burn phone if they somehow manage to get the number then its no good and saying anything incriminating would be downfall if someone that wanted to arrest you has it on recording with Your voice <br /><br />I wouldnt be surprised if there is already big dealers who use it now instead of phones, times are changing and phones are dead

Texting is probably no better than using a cell phone for a phone call unless its texting from a new prepaid phone 2 another prepaid phone

				Ever watched The Wire? The dealers use burners (prepaid cell phones) for all their drug biz. They have a guy drive up and down the highway buying one or two at each store. But, the source eventually gets lazy (and tempted by his girl toy) and starts buying several phones at each location. The cops end up following him and getting a pre-emptive tap on the unpurchased phones before the burner source picks them up.<br /><br />Hands down, TOR is the way to go, preferably from a different access point each time.

Android phones are imo the clear winners when it comes to secured communications with cell phones, they have apps that encrypt text voice and instant messages (and the entire phones storage), and they are compatible with any other Android phone, and they cost a fraction of what a purpose specific encrypted phone costs (not to mention the encryption apps are free).&nbsp;

				They can get a court order to pull of your previous texts (to a certain timeframe) so if you must use a phone, then a phone call would be best to discuss anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;

They don&#039;t need a warrant to read your texts but they do need one to target you specifically.<br /><br />This is how I see it: Any digital text, in any form, unless encrypted end-to-end, is dangerous. Big brother is constantly upping the ante in terms of how much data they can record and monitor. If you&#039;re sending something in plaintext, assume it&#039;s being recorded and monitored. This includes e-mail, texts, IMs, Facebook chats, and just about anything else you can type. All they need to do is run a search to find communications containing specific terms (related to drugs, terrorism, kiddie-porn, or anything else they don&#039;t want the general public doing) and get a search warrant based on that information. Does that happen often? Probably not. Will it become more prevalent? Most definitely.<br /><br />Check out the big cover article in Wired recently. The NSA is building the largest government owned data center in the world. It will consume more power than most small cities. What do you think they&#039;re going to do with all that computing power and storage? If you need some hints, these are good starting points:<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy<br />https://www.eff.org/nsa/faq<br /><br />Phone conversations certainly aren&#039;t safe but if they don&#039;t already have a warrant, they&#039;re probably isn&#039;t anybody actively listening to your conversations. I personally don&#039;t believe there&#039;s enough computing power for them to convert all of our phone conversations into searchable text, but with this new data center, anything is possible. For the time being, if you can&#039;t talk in person, I would talk on the phone unless you have reason to suspect there&#039;s an open warrant.

				I have little doubt that virtually all text messages in the US are being archived... and possibly personal email communications as well. I worry that any texts I send or receive could come back to haunt me years from now. But what about phone conversations? I bet the records of who called whom are archived, but what about the actual conversation audio? Intuitively I feel like talking about drugs over a cell line is better than texting, because the voice content can probably only get you in trouble if somebody is eavesdropping RIGHT NOW.

				I was wondering the same thing.&nbsp; Once, I was pretty fucked up, talking on the phone with a friend, and said something along the lines of, &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m going to share my 2C-X with so and so.&quot;&nbsp; I felt like such a jackass for saying it and immediately hung up the phone in paranoia.&nbsp; But I have no legal record and LEO never busted down my door.&nbsp; Additionally, the other night I was tripping on 25i-NBOMe and wouldn&#039;t even answer my friend&#039;s phone calls because I get so conspiratorial on certain psychs.&nbsp; I try to limit my drug chats to face-to-face communication, and most certainly would never speak of SR over email, text, or the phone.
