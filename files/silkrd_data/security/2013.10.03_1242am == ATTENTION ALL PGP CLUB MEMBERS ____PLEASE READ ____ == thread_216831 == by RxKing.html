				&nbsp;So are we to all believe that DPR himself never used PGP and was going into forums looking for coders and using gmail as his email address back in the day?<br /><br />We are also to believe that a vendor was going to release 5k names of users and vendors and that upset him so much that he solicited a hit man...and got one and they claim they did the job for 150k and months before DPR had someone hit for 80k. That he has&nbsp; no attorneys (I have 2). <br /><br />Your group may not like that I think PGP for addresses is useless. And I know that all of you believe the cops are all just around the corner ready to make a bust....but do you really think the story we have all been told is true?<br /><br />And all this over a vendor that had 5k addresses of&nbsp; buyers and vendors?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />REALLY?<br /><br />Let&#039;s put the pgp aside for a day and discus this....because if I am to believe what I am being told is true, DPR is one of the stupidest people on the planet...and I have had many of talks with many a DPR over the 1.6 years I have been here...and he never once came of as stupid. EVER.

				I agree. The whole story seems fishy. I think someone snitched and got protection asap, hence the fabricated story

				To your statement about DPR using pgp, I can assure you he did not unless the recipient demanded it of him. Even then, sometimes he still wouldn&#039;t. I have first hand knowledge of this fact, even dealing with things that definitely should be encrypted (like off site communications via email for example).<br /><br />You have always come across to me as someone reasonably smart, just painfully ignorant about DPRs abilities and security.

Unfortunately, DPR is now the poster child for Astor&#039;s tagline:&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No one has ever regretted being too secure, but many people have regretted not being secure enough.&quot;<br /><br />I went into the book club section of the Forum once, and my head just about exploded. DPR seemed to be more interested in debating the Libertarian equivalent of &quot;How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?&quot; than he was in security. If he had spent his time maintaining/improving his opsec, instead of engaging in debates about crackpot economic theories, he might not be where he is now. <br /><br />Nightcrawler <br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br /><br />
