				I recently purchased his ATM hack with a few spare BTC, it came in three files, Two txt files (User manual for both types of atm) and a third word document that didn&#039;t seem to open at first.<br /><br />When i did try to open the word file a few dialogue boxes just popped up denying me access so i chucked it onto my tab and it opened fine, i thought nothing of it other then maybe not having the wright codec or some shit.<br /><br />After looking at the files on my tab i decided to delete the ATM files i downloaded onto my pc which then popped up with a dialogue saying one of the files was being used in another program and was therefore unable to delete, this instantly raised a red flag for me as txt and word documents should not be open unless..well they&#039;re open..<br /><br />I went onto task manager and one process stuck out to me, it was in capitals and the name was badly concealed i cant remember what the process was called exactly (stupid of me to not take note i know) but someone had tried to blend it in with everyday processes.<br /><br />I ended the process and deleted the file, but i thought id report my findings on the forums so a more tech savvy bredda could take a look at it, it might just be me but i thought i better warn as that listing is getting purchased very regularly now and im just waiting for multiple SR accounts to be reported stolen.<br /><br />NO PARS INTENDED UK STEALTH, UNLESS IT IS MALWARE THEN PARS ARE INTENDED.

				Did i really offend you that much?<br /><br />I tried deleting&nbsp; the word file which wouldnt open on my pc.. there were no word processes open so i had to search through processes that had no relevance to the file. I then ended a process that stuck out to me as being abnormal as it was named BOOTER.exe or something, the only process in capitals and was given a name to blend in. <br /><br />After ending 2 processes prior that i thought may have been related to the word document i ended &quot;BOOTER.exe&quot; and i could then delete the word document. So my automatic assumption is that the word document had a file within it that was running malware or some sort of process that i had to find and stop manually before it could be deleted. I know you can hide files in JPEGs so why not word docs?<br />And yes i thought id post it on the forums and let it be a drifting bit of info for people rather then ask you the person i purchased it from if it had hidden malware. I posted this so people can have a look over it themselves im not claiming to have a degree in computer science... also your wright about the waccy baccy im usually high before 1am at night :)<br /><br />Just to confirm my AV didnt pickup anything it was just me trying to delete your out of date &quot;ATM Hack&quot;.<br /><br />Only a guilty man would get that angry ;)

				Rule number 1 - do not throw a vendor under the buss until he has spoken with you or you have decided that he has been ignoring you. He/vendor is most definately not over reacting by what he has posted, you stepped on his toes and he got pissed.

				I have no clue who these people are, but for the record, a Microsoft Word document can easily contain malware.&nbsp; It&#039;s bullshit to say otherwise.

				Maybe i should of spoke to him first... this was more of an attempt to get someone to look the files over than it was to slander him.<br /><br />

Only just recently a few poor bastards bought files from someone over at BMR and lost all there BTC.!<br /><br />So listen up everyone! protect your self&#039;s on this side of the Dark Web!.
