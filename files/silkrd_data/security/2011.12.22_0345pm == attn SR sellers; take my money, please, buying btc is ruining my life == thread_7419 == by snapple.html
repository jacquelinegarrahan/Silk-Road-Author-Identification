				The problem when reading forums to figure out how to turn cash into bitcoins is that bitcoin buying advice is like an asshole, everyone has one. Half the sites don&#039;t exist anymore, or changed their policies, or have people saying they got robbed using X service, and then half the posts explain methods that no longer work and on and on it goes.<br /><br />It seems like every week some new scheme is unveiled as the easiest way to buy bitcoins, but it usually takes a dozen steps, requires me to open accounts at getbitcoin, then a dwolla, then an instawallet and then mt gox and then SR and you&#039;ve got to be fucking kidding me here, I&#039;m a druggie not Julian Assange.<br /><br />I just want to put bitcoins directly into my SR account so I can self-medicate. I don&#039;t need 100 layers of encryption, tumbling, and bullshit, if the Feds want to track my purchase of a few dime bags I don&#039;t care, I just want to make the transaction without having to get a computer science degree from MIT. <br /><br />Does anyone know of a method for those of us who aren&#039;t able to spend 50 hours figuring out how not to get scammed here? And if you post back, &quot;read the forums&quot; I have, and there&#039;s no clear answer to be had here or in the bitcoin forum.

				You can easily buy bitcoins from GetBitcoin and have it deposited directly into your Silk Road account. It&#039;s not that complicated or hard to do, and it doesn&#039;t take long either.

				If you aren&#039;t overly paranoid and it sounds like you aren&#039;t....take the time to go through Dwolla.&nbsp; You will have to link a bank account and it can take 3-5 days to get it to transfer but if you plan ahead and have the time its a pretty easy way to go.&nbsp; From Dwolla you can then link to mt gox or tradehill and buy BTC at the current rate with very cheap service charge.&nbsp; Or figure out the other methods that you can use by taking the time to read the forums like you are doing. Moneypak costs more but can be way more immediate and there have been some serious scams along with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Getbitcoin is a REALLY good way too&nbsp; You&#039;ve made it this far...that took some effort...now just go the last step of the journey.&nbsp; You&#039;re almost there.

				Unforunatly to deal in a private underground place we will have to jump through a few hoops.&nbsp; but i do agree.&nbsp; I think when dealing souly with cash there is alays going to be the risk of being scammed.&nbsp; I have used btcbuddy and sugarmamma and both did me right.&nbsp; I have also used getbitcoin when they accepted wells faro.&nbsp; From what i have seen, and i am far from an expert or good at spelling. The way to go is get money into mt. gox.&nbsp; Keep some cash there so when you are ready to get btc you can buy it and then move it to your sr account.&nbsp; this is done i believe because of the fluctuating market and can help save you some btc.&nbsp; It will be nice when it becomes easier to get btc with case, less hoops.

				As bigsniffer points out, this is in fact the black market. And it&#039;s a nerdy one. Obviously the whole BTC-SR-PGP deal isn&#039;t for average Joe, and yes there is some risk involved. I guess you can say that trading on Silk Road has a certain IQ requirement. No offence (really). Good luck on getting bitcoins, I hope you&#039;ll make it :)

				You can use a credit card to buy bitcoins at http://simplecoin.com/ <br /><br />I haven&#039;t used it so I can&#039;t personally vouch for it but hey, if you want bitcoins fast then it seems like this website is what you want.

				Simplecoin is currently down.<br /><br />OP if you want the easiest/quickest way to get some BTC, go ahead and utilize the services of Sugar Mama, BTC Buddy, or BTCpal. (maybe some others I&#039;ve forgotten.)

				No offense sugarmama. However as with all MoneyPak to BTC vendors be careful. Read the scammers list first. Check for any negative ratings. The first negative ratings on any BTC seller will be followed by a tirade of attacks on the noob. Then an experienced seller will get his coins. He/she may not realize that he/she is part of the scam. They will in good faith post to the board that &quot;all is well&quot;. The reports will again trickle in and some people will wait hoping there is a glitch in the BTC matrix and the BTC vendor will come through. Then at the end of it all the BTC vendor just pull the big one and leave. <br /><br />Also be cautious of vendors who claim they will not do small money pack transactions. There maybe limits on these cards however small is the way to build trust. Small is the way to avoid scams. Good luck trading for BTC on SR. I would however follow the advice of a lot of others and avoid BTC transactions on SR. There have been too many SunYunGai&#039;s. <br /><br />There could also be a karma system on reviewers like slashdot. The bad reports if backed up by another good karma buyer should immediately sound off&nbsp; vendor malpractice. Kinda like one transaction is bad, all buyers in the past 72 hours get a notice of this bad transaction and are encouraged to be pro-active. If there has been another bad transaction with two more buyers the account goes into lock down mode. Scam nipped in the bud is what SR needs. The trouble with financial scam on SR is that it&#039;s the most likely to be reported to the local news networks/ Law enforcement. It will threaten the very existence of SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love SR but have no love lost for BTC transactions on SR. <br />Good Luck all noobs.

				Everything you&#039;re saying is true, so don&#039;t take this as me disagreeing with you...<br /><br />Trading BTC for moneypak also benefit&#039;s the seller, especially if they sell other goods.... think about it.<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of a way to launder money. Another security net.

				Personally, I think the difficulty in obtaining bitcoins is a small price to pay for sitting on my ass and having stupidly high quality drugs sent to me.&nbsp; If someone really wants to equate taking a couple of extra steps to running Wikileaks, then I really dunno what to tell them.&nbsp; I especially don&#039;t have much sympathy if they aren&#039;t even worried about security and anonymity!&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case, you could have bitcoins in a few easy steps. :P

				This link is damn funny!&nbsp; Nice start to it and great follow through.&nbsp; I wish I could add to some of the great humor, unfortunately I can only add my experience.&nbsp; Watch using MtGox, they want photo ID and 2nd supporting document)&nbsp; For only 100 BTC or around $500 transaction.&nbsp; I am in the process of finalizing my transaction today with GetBitCoin.com.&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; Walked into my local Chase and deposited $200.&nbsp; Received confirmation within 15 minutes from GBC.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see how long the actual transfer takes.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is going to be 5-10% higher going the GBC route, but they aren&#039;t asking for a freaking mortgage application to be completed either.&nbsp; If the Yale kids makes a few dollars off me and I do not get prosecuted....all is good in the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW, I used to be a diehard Conservative....but what f&#039;ing hippocrits!&nbsp; Government out of everyone&#039;s business...until we think it should be&nbsp; their business (e.g. prostitution, drugs, abortion).&nbsp; I am no Libber either.&nbsp; All make me sick!

				all good sound advice here. as you can see there are many options which may make it seem more complicated . you have to choose what fits you best&nbsp; and most important to you. saving money saving time or saving your ass. so far&nbsp; i have found using getbitcoins can be easy and cheap and if you dont mind giving them your bank account and name you can do it all from your computer. but it all can take time. its even easier to just walk in their bank and deposit in their account. Then you dont have to give therm your personal info either. using moneypak and such is fast but you could get easily scammed if your unlucky. good guys can easily turn bad. thats about all I know so far. I havent been able to get such high quality like everyone says however. maybe im just spoiled.

				Update on GetBitCoin:<br /><br />12/28 - 12:30 PM EST - Deposited $200 cash at Chase<br />12/28 - 1:30 PM EST - Submitted copy of receipt to GBC<br />12/29 - 3:55 AM EST - Received BTC in Wallet<br /><br />Paid $4.33 vs going rate on MtGox of $4.22.&nbsp; Extra $.11 worth it given the issues encountered with MtGox.&nbsp; BTW, someone said MtGox would accept about anything.&nbsp; NOT true.&nbsp; They rejected my scanned drivers license.&nbsp; Said it was not clear enough.&nbsp; I had to send a photo of it.&nbsp; They then approved.&nbsp; I give them a 5/5 for TAT on responses, but all else is 1/5.&nbsp; I will be returning my money to Dwolla, cashing out, and sticking with the &quot;in person&quot; cash deposits at Chase for GBC!<br /><br />Use GBC....I would not want any BTC associated with my drivers license and utility bill (2nd document required by (MtGox).

Your Not the First to have to eventually Master BC’s. Lots&#039; of good Forums on that.&nbsp; I’ve tried 4 different Trade Exchanges and I personally have an affinity to CampBx. You can establish the account on-line. They require No Id or copy of utility bills like the rest. Just a User ID and an email where they send confirmations. I send in Money Orders weekly and simply reference my User ID and email. I then place a Limit Order ( My Buy or Sell Order for Dollars or BC’s only executes when BC hits a certain Price, right now my Limit is 2.99 to Buy) If your patient, the Price will hit and all the Dollars you placed will Buy at that price. There’s also no fee for Transferring BC’s. If your Selling BC’s for Dollars, once your BC’s sell you can transfer to place where you can get Paper money. At moment and you can Quote me later, but I think BC&#039;s will Pass 5 in next 30 days and the longer you complain the Less BC’s you’ll be Buying.
