				Probably will be the least constructive idea but my guess would be the article about SR that is being published in Septembers issue of Forbes attracting more customers? Pretty sure all the people that has a subscription has gotten their copy in the mail already or maybe something else. I&#039;ve been noticing the rising price of the btc as well though.

				You would need to poll every single person buying bitcoins to answer your question.&nbsp; I know that&#039;s not helpful but it&#039;s the truth.&nbsp; The reason is simple economics: more demand and less selling of btc at the current price.&nbsp; This looks like investment to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Generally it could be because of more people becoming aware of it, it could be because of people willing to take a big risk and hope to get rich, it could be people trying to buy into a currency they have more faith in than their own.&nbsp; It&#039;s not because of SR though.

				escrow remains the same, what you paid in btc when you ordered doesn&#039;t change, but the value of those btc might change so&nbsp; the vendor might end up getting more $ for btc in the end if btc rises, or less $ if it falls.&nbsp; <br /><br />
