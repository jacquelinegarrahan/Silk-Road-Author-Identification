				I just made a direct deposit to cavirtex via RBC. The teller was asking me a bunch of questions, is this a business? are they expecting this deposit? are you a employee? etc. <br /><br />She asked me for my I.D and I said I didn&#039;t bring it. She just took down my name. <br /><br />Will I be ok as long as I launder the coins through another wallet, before putting them on SR?

Anybody can send anybody else anything in the mail. However, I would highly recommend you read through the security forum before you make any purchases on SR. Take the time to learn how to use PGP, always encrypt your address, and never Finalize Early.<br />If you have any questions, do a search for them; if a search turns up no answers, make a new thread with your problem and you&#039;ll get the answers you need.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />- grahamgreene
