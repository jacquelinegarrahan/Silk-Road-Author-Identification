				Greetings Friends,<br /><br />As the title clearly states, I am recommending and giving my &quot;super duper official&quot; endorsement to BitStamp.net as the new TOR-friendly, anonymous bitcoin (BTC) trading exchange. <br /><br />Bitstamp requires no ID, only a fake name and an e-mail, and then you can deposit coins from any wallet or from your now-defunct BitFloor account. After about 20-30 minutes, your account is funded, and you may begin trading. And as you were able to do so with BitFloor, you can always transfer your BTC&#039;s to another BTC address (for instance, to SR when you need to make a purchase) with BitStamp too. <br /><br />Happy trading, and spread the +karmic love<br /><br />Your friend shooting infinite love from this side of hyperspace to yours,<br />UANDiR1

				it seems pretty cool. Made an account with my tormail.org address and no id requirements. Only drawback is it takes 2 yo 5 days for funds to show up after a deposit. I think I can do better than that with another source

I didn&#039;t do that, but rather just deposited/transferred BTC from one address to my Bitstamp address, which took 20 mins. I&#039;m assuming you can use moneygram to the Bitstamp btc address directly as well, should be quick that way too. But my original point is that Bitstamp is the best TOR-friendly anonymous platform for trading, with an emphasis on trading (as demonstrated by the caps in the title), vs just a method for getting BTC to buy on SR. If you&#039;re the kind of guy who likes to have a little invested in BTC, then Bitstamp has the best platform on the market thus far as far as anonymous functionality goes, which makes MtGox a no-no.

				yea I checked it out and it&#039;s cool that you can use tor for the whole process I just have to figure out a way to get a deposit made. I don&#039;t fancy having to wait 2 to 5 days. I have used a few vendors here and it has always worked with in an hour or 2. BST for one has been very trusting. It appears that bitinstant is is working again with a deposit sent to bitcoin address again but there is no bank deposit. The moneygram option is open tho. Before I never used my real name and they never ask for an id at any money gram location

				And how do you know that bitstamp won&#039;t go the route of bitfloor as well? It seems to me that there are forces out there that are attacking any viable alternatives to the fucking us dollar (please note the still ongoing attack on gold and silver by the us and euro central banks, in order to drive down the price of precious metals to convince the sheeple that these are not worthy of refuge).<br /><br />The &quot;closing&quot; of the us bank account of bitfloor is very telling and very worrisome.<br /><br />goblin

But this is a tiny eastern European country, they probably have very little if any incentive to attack Bitcoin. So in short do your research. Don&#039;t put money into an account that has to follow AML/KYC regulations. You will either have to verify your identity (Like Gox) or the exchange will be shut down (Like BitFloor).

No flagging, just as we were previously able to do so with bitfloor. And as another friend mentioned, BitStamp is headquartered in Slovenia, an &quot;underground-friendly&quot; nation if you will, comparative to most. I hope BitStamp gives me my commission for giving them this advertising, haha. I&#039;m just a fellow SR buyer as most of you, who also trades BTC on the side, amongst many other public equities that are LEGAL to trade, and quite lucrative. Life is fun once one gets the hang of it, haha.

As I have mentioned already here and on a couple other threads as well, you can just transfer your BTC&#039;s to your Bitstamp btc address after you register for free using TOR, a fake name, and whatever e-mail you used for bitfloor. Once you are registered, login to Bitfloor and withdraw your BTC&#039;s to your Bitstamp address. It is soooo simple, there really shouldn&#039;t be any confusion.

				alright. I made an account with bitstamp and traded my coins from bitfloor over. It says &quot;waiting for 3 confirmations&quot; idk what that means. I suppose i just gotta wait a few mins for the transaction to go through. Can anybody explain to me the details on how to deposit the U.S dollar balance into my bank account once ive sold the bitcoins? With bitfloor i just had to send them a pic of my photo I.D and list the checking and routing numbers on one of my checks. Does the same method apply with bitstamp?

I made an account with bitstamp and traded my coins from bitfloor over. It says &quot;waiting for 3 confirmations&quot; idk what that means. I suppose i just gotta wait a few mins for the transaction to go through. Can anybody explain to me the details on how to deposit the U.S dollar balance into my bank account once ive sold the bitcoins? With bitfloor i just had to send them a pic of my photo I.D and list the checking and routing numbers on one of my checks. Does the same method apply with bitstamp?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You don&#039;t have to verify yourself at Bitstamp and you&#039;ll be able to withdraw your money using an international wire transfer, the fee for this is $15.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And the fee is well worth the advantage you get of staying ANONYMOUS. That&#039;s why even though I loved Bitfloor like the rest of you folks, I love Bitstamp even more. And the interface is sooooo much smoother, faster, and easier on the eye. Also, the website is not going down every 30 minutes because of DDOS either. Even during the DDOS raids a week ago on both MtGox and DDOS, before I even had a Bitstamp account and was exclusive with Bitfloor, I noticed that Bitstamp&#039;s servers were the most stable and I was always able to get a quote off their site. I just hope the LEO&#039;s don&#039;t attack Bitstamp with coordinated DDOS and theft attempts, as they did with Bitfloor. Pray to God on that one.

				how can you stay anonymous while giving bitstamp your bank account information to deposit money into? That doesn&#039;t make sense. Wouldn&#039;t they know who you are once you gave them that info? It doesn&#039;t matter to me as i am just using the bitcoins i purchased for legal trading. I set up the account in my own name. I&#039;ll just make a separate account for SR transfers. In unrelated news, seeing the price of the bitcoin going up is making me a happy little boy. I bought 1000 us dollars worth of bitcoin yesterday morning and i&#039;m already at like 1200! I feel like michael douglas in wall street!

Getting arrested is always possible, but as long as you keep getting CONVICTED impossible, you have NOTHING or NOBODY to fear. Hell, if you are wealthy enough and have a good lawyer, you can even use arrests without convictions to your advantage as grounds for counter-suit and net $$$ off that.

I would rather just cash out (when I&#039;m good and ready weeks to months from now) by transferring BTC from bitstamp to a wallet, and then using an anonymous cashing out service. Sounds obvious to me, and I know for a fact I have stated this methodology before, but people just don&#039;t seem to listen or understand. I guess a lot of bad drug users here too, in addition to the good ones, haha.

				Although I do use silk road to make purchases occaisionally, the 1000 dollars in bitcoins that I bought came from my own personal savings, not drug profit money or anything. Since buying and selling bitcoins is legal, I don&#039;t have anything to worry about by making a bitstamp account in my own name, and using the wire transfer option to cash out right? The bitcoins that i purchased yesterday did not even touch my SR wallet. I don&#039;t think that any eyebrows would be raised if I wired the money into my account, and even if the police paid me a visit,&nbsp; I would just tell them the truth, that I bought bitcoins and resold them when their value increased. I don&#039;t see the reason to use an anonymous cashing out service if nothing that i&#039;m doing is illegal. I&#039;m not the smartest person on the planet, so please correct me if there is a flaw in my logic. I believe anonymous cash out services charge an additional fee too right?
