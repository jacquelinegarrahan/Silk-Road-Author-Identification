				So, I&#039;ve been here for about 5 days, reading tutorials, setting up my encryption and whatnot. Now, I just want to make sure of a few things.<br /><br />First of all, I want to buy Bitcoin via my debit card. I think it&#039;s a bit inconvenient to go and make cash deposits because they usually require an ID, so even that way, they can still track the money. So... buy from MTGOX (clearnet, because they only allow it like this) from work or public library via my usual debit card.<br /><br />Then, transfer 1 or 2 times to InstaWallet.<br /><br />Then, transfer to a TOR-ified QT Wallet (you know, the usual wallet app from the bitcoin makers)<br /><br />Then, transfer to SR.<br /><br />What do you think?

				In my experience (others may agree) you never need an ID to make a cash deposit. I do cash deposits at walmart. Otherwise, the transferring method seems sound.

				Well, I live in Europe. I&#039;m not sure about the bank rules here to be completely honest with you. But, I do have a certain aversion about going to an institution and signing to put some cash somewhere. But I guess I could look into this more closely. <br /><br />Does BitInstant even work for Europe?<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Meh, I just checked. BitInstant, for example, is crap in my European country: they only support Coupons. 3 types of&#039;em.

				I don&#039;t know what the next best option is for you. I do know, however, that the fees and risks are higher if you&#039;re using your bank account.

				The whole bitcoin thing isn&#039;t all that difficult. The idea is to break the link between the coin and yourself. Easy to do. But first&nbsp; a few things:<br /><br />You can not purchase BTC with a debit card as far as I am aware.<br /><br />Even if it was possible there is no reason to use a public wifi spot if you did use your debit card as that identifies you.<br /><br />The QT wallet is slow and bloated. Cloud wallets are much better assuming you do not intend to store BTC long term.<br /><br />How to break the link:<br />There are many ways to make this happen, this is just one. With bitinstant no longer (at the moment anyway) doing cash to wallet transactions your are forced to use an exchange. Mt Gox is one of the better, but in the end it doesn&#039;t matter which you choose. Mt Gox is convientinet because they offer many deposit options, including bit instant. Choose one that fits you.&nbsp; Setup and be legit on your exchange account, use your real name and address. Make the deposit and purchase bitcoins, Now you have your bitcoins now it is time to break the link. <br /><br />IN AN ENCRYPTED OR VIRTUALIZED ENCRYPTED SYSTEM with TOR running get an instawallet address. Transfer from MtGox to the instawallet address you accessed with tor. From there you can transfer straight to SR, the link is severed. <br /><br />If you are extra paranoid you can transfer from instawallet to a TORified tumbler like bitcoinfog then to SR.<br /><br />That&#039;s it. Not much to it. The transfer to instawallet breaks your IP association.

				Thank you for your answer paxpax! It is very clear, and a few of the things I already recognize from my previous reading.<br /><br />It is surprising to find out that I can&#039;t buy BitCoin with a debit card. So MTGOX doesn&#039;t offer this? Surprising.<br /><br />Then, what other ways do I have? Because I can&#039;t use BitInstant from my country. Apparently they only offer 3 types of coupons as purchase options.<br /><br />One more question: what price will I actually pay for the BitCoin? The MTGOX price? Because I saw some prices for BitCoins on some websites that were really outrageous.

This is called taint. If you don&#039;t believe me, do a transfer from Mt Gox to an ewallet. Then search for your ewallet address on blockchain.info.&nbsp; Make a note of the address(es) that sent coins to your ewallet address (write down at least the first 5 characters). These are the Mt Gox addresses linked to your account and identity. <br /><br />Now transfer coins to another address. Doesn&#039;t have to be SR. Could just be another ewallet service. Now search for the *second* ewallet address on blockchain.info.<br /><br />Click the &quot;taint analysis&quot; option and hit ctrl+f, then type in the original Mt Gox addresses. They will be there.<br /><br />In order to &quot;break the link&quot;, you need to send the coins through a proper mixing service like the one that blockchain.info offers, or Cleanbit, or Bitcoin Fog.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Damaged -<br />&nbsp;The point is your link to the coins is now severed. You could have sent those coins to anyone, if you access the instawallet by TOR your IP can not be linked to that wallet. Anyone could own that wallet you sent the coin to.&nbsp;
