				&lt;mini-rant&gt;<br /><br />So far into it this dude seems like a major dick with a hard on for name dropping. Also if you&#039;ve read a cross-section of literature do you ever notice how we&#039;re being continually pathologized into having mental illnesses like psychopathy or sociopathy and other &#039;pathies&#039;?<br /><br />I mean what the fuck! Apparently wanting fat stacks makes you criminally insane or something. Guess that puts most investors, entrepreneurs and businesspeople into the box as well. <br /><br />Selfish != Self Interest<br />Self Interest != Irrational.<br /><br />It&#039;s the difference between what I like to call &#039;short term greedy&#039; vs &#039;long term greedy&#039;. Short term greedy is inherently destructive, whereas long term greedy is inherently productive.<br /><br />I think this bias exists in the literature because:<br /><br />A: The sample they get their info from is 9/10 coming from the ones who got caught aka: usually the dumber criminals with a short term perspective. Those types of criminals never put themselves in the position of the police, let alone the DEA, so they get caught every time.<br /><br />B: The criminologists and sociologists writing the literature veer strongly to the left of the political spectrum. Not always of course, but usually. As a result, they *already* consider capitalists to be criminals (watch the film: &quot;The Corporation&quot; and you&#039;ll see what I mean), so it&#039;s a foregone conclusion for them. These are pretty much the same people who think: &quot;killing is wrong&quot; as an absolute, despite the fact we&#039;ve been murdering each other for tens of thousands of years with motivations that range from Bananas to Totally Justified. <br /><br />C: Very few anthropologists study the black market. Lack of reliable good data.<br /><br />But mostly, it&#039;s because they make no fucking effort whatsoever to make intelligent deductions. Fuck those lazy assholes seeking tenure.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />/end mini-rant<br /><br />

				Yup, the usual suspects: uptight morons who memorize a bunch of shit they don&#039;t understand and try to bend the truth to match their personal beliefs. They usually have no experience with drugs other than using that rote learning &quot;skill&quot; of theirs to memorize the same nonsense they&#039;ve been hearing since their childhood verbatim. Ironically, the &quot;experts&quot; that have claimed prior drug use are either past addicts with no self control, or those predisposed to mental illness i.e. schizoaffectives. They smoke one joint and suffer a panic attack or psychotic episode, then blame it on the bud instead of their own genetics or the anticipation they had for some sort of negative effect. Who cares about being objective when you&#039;re the hallmark of science and knowledge, amirite? Someone who knows better has to teach us little people how to behave.<br /><br />These narcissistic, elitist clowns actually love capitalism, as long as it benefits them and not anyone they disagree with. Become friends with one of these crusaders and have lunch with them; their tune will change if they think they&#039;re speaking in private. The ones who completely denounce capitalism and competition are living in a dream world. They are guilt-ridden over their own human nature and, as far as I&#039;m concerned, are the true delusional sociopaths here. I&#039;d love to see them come up with a better way to govern mankind without resorting to hip, feel-good ideas that history has shown to be full of fail time and time again.<br /><br />Even shows like Drugs inc.--where they sometimes interview &quot;high-tier&quot; members of the drug trade with their identities poorly concealed--won&#039;t even give you a glimpse of the higher echelons of the game. I almost wish anthropologists could get close enough to this trade to document the people on the business side of it. It&#039;s not much different from other forms of unregulated capitalism. Not saying that such a market is 100% good, but has anyone tried to open a business in the US lately? Here in the northeast... hahaha good luck. You either have to be lucky, previously wealthy, or incredibly talented (like top 2% of the population) with an original idea that&#039;s marketable (again, good luck with that). Trying to open a successful company while you&#039;re still young is nigh impossible over here if you start at the bottom. You just can&#039;t get the capital together without doing something illegal, or at least having connections that will get you a good, steady job via nepotism that you can then save from. Once you got the money to start, you need to find lawyers and CPAs to handle the insane amount of regulation--and that&#039;s if your business is something simple like retail. Once you open up your store or whatever, get ready to do even more cheating, lying, and other forms of manipulation if you want to stay ahead of the competition. Oh, and then there&#039;s the issue of organized crime and their desire for a cut of your profits. They tend to be easier and cheaper to deal with than the taxman though lol. Just wait till you see that workers comp bill...<br /><br />It&#039;s hardly a surprise that entrepreneurs without an existing powerbase would flock to the drug trade, at least as a start. Why bother doing things the right way when almost everyone has to break some rules these days? Not everyone is a genius or has the luck to compete with entrenched conglomo-factions and the rules they sponsor in order to keep themselves a step ahead of you. Getting a stable job that actually pays a decent living wage is also a dream unless you are top talent or have influential friends/family working for that company. Sadly, there&#039;s not much choice, unless you enjoy living a meager life and waiting until the economy improves.<br /><br />When society becomes too complex with arbitrary rules and regulations, it will probably break down. Guess what field I&#039;d want to have experience in before tackling THAT market?

				Excellent post ^ as a dealer/entrepreneur for 9 years this sums up my opinions and viewpoints in a way which would take me ages to break down myself and type up.
