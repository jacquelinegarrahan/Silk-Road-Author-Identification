				not that I know of, although that doesn&#039;t mean that there&#039;s not something else that hopefully someone will come along and point out so we both know.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just as a matter of interest, if you click on the green onion and go to cookie preferences, you&#039;ll see all the cookies you&#039;ve picked up during the browser session.&nbsp; Only two of them are for the forums and one for SR (assuming you&#039;ve logged into both during the session).&nbsp; They&#039;re all deleted when you close the browser but I think it does no harm to get rid of any you&#039;ve picked up during the session if you&#039;ve been going to sites other than the forums or SR.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know enough about cookies to feel comfortable that any outside of the SR sites are benevolent.<br /><br />

				on your menu toolbar go to Tools then options.&nbsp; Tor is based on firefox and they&#039;ve left the firefox options there plus added their own options settings (click on the onion and choose preferences to see them)
