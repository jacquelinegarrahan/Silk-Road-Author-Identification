				Okay without risking sounding like LE I&#039;ve just made my first 4-5 successful (small) sales on SR and I now have a few BTC it&#039;s come to the point where I need to think about how I&#039;d go about converting the bitcoins to cash (Â£).<br /><br />Could people with some experience selling or otherwise give me some pointers on what steps you guys take to get the bitcoins off and feel fairly confident on your anonymity? <br /><br />My current plan is to transfer from SR to Mybitcoin or similar, wait a few days then use one of the tumbling services and send back to a different mybitcoin address and then send to one of the exchanges to withdraw. Is this a sound plan? Should I be adding any steps? Making any further precautions?<br /><br />At the moment I feel confident I&#039;m anonymous but once I get to a point where I want to actually take money out and put it in my bank I want to feel as secure as possible. Help in this area would be highly appreciated.<br /><br />-Lysander

				Okay I hear a lot about fake ID&#039;s but how the hell do you guys do that? Seems like waaaay harder than all the other steps in the process. What&#039;s the point in BTC being so anonymous and awesome if you have to somehow engage in getting a fake ID as well? If I had a fake ID then I wouldn&#039;t even need BTC in particular... Not being sarcastic here I just would have no idea where to start with something like that? Is it bad to just go ECurrency &gt; Bank account in that process?

				Just use https://www.bitcoin7.com/?ref=7314 to sell your bitcoins and then you can transfer to your bank account through dwolla. That is what I do. If you use the link above with my reference we both get a discount on the trading of bitcoins to cash I believe. If you want some good karma, help a brother out and use my reference link above. Thanks!

				@saladman100<br />Bitcoins can be traced to your BTC exchange account which can be traced to your bank account if you do that. Sellers here don&#039;t want their bitcoins to be able to be traced back to them. A tumbler usually works fine but there are people who tend to be extra paranoid (not a bad thing) about it.

				I thought bitcoins are untraceable which is why they are used here on SR. So I guess they aren&#039;t huh? Well I use bitcoin7 because there are based in Europe (Poland I think) so they are less likely to work with US feds I believe then a US company. I could be wrong but if you use a tumbler and then use bitcoin7 and then transfer to Dwolla and then your bank account I think you are pretty safe. I wouldn&#039;t worry to much unless you are like some huge drug kingpin on here selling a shit load.

				Couple questions regarding changing BTC to cash. When opening up a Liberty reserve account, one can use fake name, etc when signing up, correct? I think the only one where you have to give real info is if you use dwolla.<br /><br />Another question is what are the best tumbling companies out there. or is it best to just open up a couple of mybitcoin accounts and then xfer? Im just trying to figure out the safest and easiest way to change btc into dollars. I know how to do it if I wasn&#039;t worried about my identity. So, your help is appreciated..

				When they busted egold..the carders using that service had transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars through. In the end some of them had cashed out to their real bank accounts and even given the exchangers real names. Crazy right? The owner of egold tracked these people down without even being asked to do so by the FBI. Didn&#039;t save him though, we was arrested for operating an unlicensed money trasmitting service or something along those lines. <br /><br />Which of these tumbler and exhange services do you trust to protect your freedom? All of them if you cash out to your own account.

				Honestly if you run through a tumbler you should be fine.&nbsp; After that it&#039;s basically just avoiding the tax man.&nbsp; Check your region&#039;s Western Union rules because a lot of the time &lt;$1k or &lt;$500 doesn&#039;t require ID, just the receiver informatoin and full sender information (name, location, amount of funds, etc.).&nbsp; <br /><br />I personally use LR once my coins have been tumbled and sold.&nbsp; I have received Western Union payments with zero issues.

It was registered on Godaddy by domainsbyproxy.com and seems to be on an annual renewal plan. The server is on 92.247.13.130 which is hosted by the company spnet.net in Bulgaria. What a mess!<br /><br /><br />The server is controlled by...<br />(excerpt from bitcoin7)<br /><br />&quot;the European operations performed by &quot;AbuDhabi 2010&quot; EOOD, a company registered in the European Union, Bulgaria, Sofia<br />the US operations performed by &quot;Risk Asset Management&quot; LLC, a company registered in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA&quot;<br /><br />and this funny little indemnification is right on the site...<br />(excerpt from bitcoin7)<br /><br />&quot;Bitcoin7 will not share, publish, or sell any user data contained in its databases. However, Bitcoin7 may be requested at any time to share trade data including, but not restricted to, emails, user transactions, and trade data by government authorities. Bitcoin7 will not deny such requests and cannot be held responsible for the leakage of information by third parties whether the action was performed intentionally or not.&quot;

				&quot;Silk Road attempted to soothe the dilemma by implementing a Bitcoin tumbling service, a topic that has yet to be mentioned or spotted by the media. Silk Road can aid anonymous purchases by laundering the transactions among the Bitcoin chain, further complicating and puzzling the public code, so finding the transaction within Bitcoin would become more difficult.&quot;<br /><br />does this mean they are already tumbled??? <br /><br />

				With the built-in tumbling service all someone tracing can really tell is that your coins were on SR at some point.&nbsp; It would be insanely close to impossible to tell the who/what/where, etc. of your actual transaction.&nbsp; If you use a different address for each withdrawal, do the withdrawals at different times and in different amounts, you won&#039;t build up a pattern that can be tracked.

				I think SR should open its tumbler up as a separate service, that way our coins would get mixed in with a larger and less illicitly-concentrated pool.
