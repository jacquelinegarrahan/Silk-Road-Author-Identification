				That&#039;s a broad topic and something you should research yourself before you start. Read the wiki and the seller guide.<br /><br />But a few general tips:<br />- Use the proper Tor browser bundle<br />- Don&#039;t give out personal details about yourself.<br />- Use a clean computer (no viruses), preferably Linux<br />- Remove metadata from the images you upload

				Packaging and shipping are going to be the first battle-fronts to get you busted. If you can do those things safely, a tight run ship is much easier to keep afloat.<br /><br />Second, loose lips sink ships, don&#039;t tell anyone. Period. If you can&#039;t do this, don&#039;t vend.<br /><br />I&#039;d say the technology safety is third compared to these two things.

I tend to look at the technical side because that&#039;s my area of interest, but the things you mention are probably way more likely to get a sloppy vendor into trouble. Good point sir.

Okay, so they track your ISP, then they track the VPN, then they know you use tor and... it stalls. Because they can&#039;t go any further than that.

In our western countries, we have a justice system. Everybody here is innocent unless there is decent acceptable proof of guilt. And just having an encrypted connection definitely does not qualify. It isn&#039;t even reasonable cause for a search warrant.<br /><br />You can have all the suspicions you want, without cold hard evidence they will never materialize in court. All the money and effort you spend on spying will be wasted.<br /><br />And I&#039;ll even do you one better. We are the internet and we&#039;re bringing the fight to your front door. The number of Chinese people accessing the Tor network through bridges is growing every day. The Chinese wall you built around the web is cracking, leaking and crumbling. Your censorship is breaking down, your system is collapsing. In the end freedom of thought and freedom of expression will prevail.
