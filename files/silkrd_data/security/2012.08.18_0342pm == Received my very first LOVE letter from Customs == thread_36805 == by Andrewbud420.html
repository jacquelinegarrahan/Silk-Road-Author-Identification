				I was more curious if anyone has ever received a letter before.<br /><br /><br />I am not worried about getting arrested over this, contacting a lawyer would be admitting guilt.My wife signed for the letter from customs... <br /><br />All in french (yes i can read french) says that 4.06 grams of possible hachish was seized, This item is illegal for import.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s all it says.. dated 4 months ago.

				Sorry, seems like a waste of time, Just like starting this thread.... I am pretty sure if anything get&#039;s seized they have to notify you... If they wanted to bust me they would have attempted delivery of the hash and busted me after signing for it, not just stopping it from entering the country... <br /><br />I am sorry but this place seems like a bunch of stupid kids.<br /><br /><br />if I got caught with 4 grams of hash on my person... I would be charged with Possession under 30 grams and get nothing but a small fine and 90% of the time with a minor possession charge if you can prove your a functioning member of society, you&#039;ll get a suspended sentence and end up without a criminal record.... most judges don&#039;t give a shit about small amounts of marijuana products.... <br /><br />&quot; I never had any hash products sent to my house, I only order computer parts and sometimes porn&quot;

				Yea 4 gs of hash isn&#039;t shit I know, hell its my medicine in my fine state, but were not talking about getting pulled over and searched. Cmon u guys know mail is more seriouse than that. Andjust because ur not arrested doesnt mean shit. I was raided many years back and the bastards took all my plants destroyed equipment etc, I was not arrested that day nor any other day in the near future. It was 6 months later when they slapped cuffs on me...and seeking legal advice when u recieve a letter saying u broke the law is not only NOT in any way guilty but also what any sane smart person would do...if this was true anyone who contacted a lawyer is somehow guilty of their alleged crime? Listen the most important thing is if they ever come knocking u keep your mouth shut as not to incriminate yourself....u can only give them one story, don&#039;t make it the wrong one&nbsp; ! Again this os just me but I would be nervous

				Sorry, I have no time read whole thread, but few points from law school courses:<br /><br />If you are taking WTH position, be sure that home address can be searched and nothing found. If something found (bond, syringe, some stuff) - it is good base to incriminate.<br /><br />Second - go and make criminal report about someone mailing you forbidden substances without your consent. Vendors, specially in other country are bulletproof to this bureaucratic measure. Otherwise judge might not be convinced (if customs criminal department decides to give case to prosecutor).<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know, how this works in Canada, but my 1. and 2. should be universal in any juridically sane country.<br /><br /><br />Local attorney might be excellent idea. But always carefully consider words. No &quot;I ordered, but please - don&#039;t tell&quot;, yes &quot;I am really have no clue, but afraid to go to ja-a-ail, snif-snif&quot;<br /><br />

				^&nbsp; &nbsp;^&nbsp; &nbsp;^&nbsp; ^&nbsp; NO, no, and no..... You know about Canadian law right? The way I had it explained to me last night was that... Unless I signed for and accepted this package and had it in my possession, there is nothing they can do..... I can have 1000 pounds of Hash stopped at the border but unless I accept the delivery their SOL for charging me for it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I might call and say WTF,,,, that I would never have such a thing sent in the mail.... Period end of story. <br /><br />I never keep anything in my house...... around 8-10 years ago I got ratted out for growing pot plants... (well the rat said I had a farm 200+ plants and a few pounds) Well... I had 6 plants and about 2 grams of pot...... they took my plants and my 2 grams and charged me with possession under 30 grams for the pot... and ended doing 10 hours community service.. for my 6 DWC plants that would have yielded me nearly a pound a piece..... <br /><br />I am not retarded.... my reasoning behind this thread is that some VENDORS SUCK...... their stealth is garbage.... Probably wrote &quot;Contains Hash&quot; on the damn package... <br /><br />

				generally people advise that you ignore love letters and stop getting packages to the same drop , if they were going to press charges chances are slim they would send a love letter. Usually love letters essentially say they are not going to press charges but to knock your shit off because it is illegal, did yours read something like that?

				If it was a serious issue a CD would have happened.<br /><br />Just abandon that address and use a new one.<br /><br />It would be flagged now in the CA customs system I believe.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s 1 gram or 1 pound.. you are attempting to import an illegal substance into your country.. remember that.

				heres my experience that does include some canadian law. i made a purchase some time ago from a canadian vendor. i live in the states. i had 3 or 4 successful orders from this vendor, all for the same products, which was for some good smoke. my last order took many weeks to arrive, which was very unusual. after about almost 2 months i received a love letter BOTH from canadian and us customes stating that a package to my address was seized. the us letter gave me a phone number to call if i wanted to go to US customs to &quot;claim it,&quot; (NEVER DO DUH!) and the canadian letter just said that it was seized for possible illegal activity or something.&nbsp; i ignored the letter and stopped using my address. nothing further happened and its been some time now.<br /><br />another experience a friend of mine had came from another site using a vendor who must have been watched. he ordered some smoke (1oz) and after many weeks the order showed up with very little product in it. it also had been opened and wasnt vac sealed. when he contacted the vendor who he had used successfully before, he ensured him that he sent the correct weight. a short time later he was raided. <br /><br />if you receive a love letter, i would not respond to it. if you wish to reach out for legal council, then feel free. LE will do what they want when they want to do it. and although they&#039;re patient, they also have a lot of fish to fry.&nbsp; DC (discontinue) using that address. If this is the first and only order seized, IMO you dont have a lot to worry about, however theres always a chance. sure, the letter did what it intended to do. to let you know that they know, to get you scared and to stop it. <br /><br />in the states there are many LL&#039;s received. many many of them are never pursued. pursuing it means LE has&nbsp; A LOT of work to do to build a case against you. again, anythings possible, but for the quantity you mentioned, it would probably not be worth their efforts to try and figure out where it was purchased, who sent it, who ordered it, etc etc. all for a small amount of hash. its possible, but not likely.&nbsp; <br /><br />and yes, there are some really retarded vendors who use the most ridiculous shipping methods. and they can really screw you!

				I don&#039;t think the Canadian government gives a fuck about 4g of hash. <br />Even if they do at least you will not be considered guilty of supporting terrorism by your federal government because you do drugs, unlike the criminal government in the country below you.<br />So yeah look at the good side of it.<br />Be safe man, peace.

I have heard this to be generally true, but not heard it repeated often enough (or I&#039;m just reading all the wrong threads and forums)<br /><br />I am interested in making mid-scale (probably considered &quot;large&quot; by legal definition) purchases from Canada to US and this was a concern in the back of my mind. Just how tight is letter mail versus package mail (again, Canada to US); rather, where can I read more information on this topic?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve ordered a number of international packages to a Canadian address, and every one has been delivered successfully. They were all mostly small packages (a quarter of bud or so); that probably makes a difference. <br /><br />I&#039;ve read that Canadian customs is very strict, but in many experience it&#039;s been great. I can tell you that driving over the border - the Canadian Customs officers don&#039;t give a fuck. At all. So I&#039;d think it would be the same for shipping. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never ordered from the US to Canada, but I know some of the top weed vendors on here are Canadian and ship to the States.
