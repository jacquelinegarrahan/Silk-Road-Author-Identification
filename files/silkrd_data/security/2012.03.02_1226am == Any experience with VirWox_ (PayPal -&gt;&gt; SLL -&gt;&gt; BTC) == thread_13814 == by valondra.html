				I was wondering if anyone had any experience getting BTC through VirWox. <br /><br />I attempted it today and the total cost turned out to be USD6.5 per BTC. I know, it was more than going through one of these vendor exchange guys with a moneypak. But I really like PayPal and there was no way to know the total cost until I went through the process. <br /><br />Also, all my orders were market orders and I could have received a better price had I attempted limit orders. Of course I can&#039;t recommend it yet since I don&#039;t have my BTC in my account; security measures have them holding my BTC for up to 48 hours before releasing it to my SR wallet. <br /><br />Anyway, just sharing for those of you who really like PayPal. All my expendable money gets sent there so the extra cost is worth the convenience of being able to just transfer money from there to the exchange and have it spit out BTC for me --all from the comfort of my own home.

				Im curious did you receive your bitcoins yet?<br />I have just tried this method as am currently unable to make it to a bank.<br />The exchange rate and fees aside, there are still a lot more expensive ways to get BTC out there.<br />This is pretty decent.(if it works)
