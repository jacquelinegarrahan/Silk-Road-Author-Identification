				&quot;Also, due to Australian law, as of September 15th we will not be able to process any AUD withdrawal or deposit from customers who&#039;s identity has not been verified. Our apologies for any inconvenience. &quot;<br /><br /><br />This is from the TradeHill website. MtGox no longer has teh option for automatic AU$ transfer available in the Add Funds section, and our only local exchange BitPiggy has been &quot;Out of Coins&quot; since the 15th (i dont think its out of coins, just putting in place measures to keep ID info on all theire customers as required by &quot;law&quot; or not able to operate under this new policy).<br /><br />What options do australians have now?

				Last night I signed up to Mt. Gox in response to the crazy restrictions that Tradehill has just implemented on us Aussies.<br /><br />So when I read your message just now I thought surely it must be a mistake but lo-and-behold they have indeed removed that ability to direct deposit $AUD into their local bank account.<br /><br />It seems an International Wire transfer is still an option but this is getting ridiculous!!<br /><br />As we don&#039;t seem to have any real alternative for use on SR we are going to have to give in to these slower, riskier, and more expensive options but what the hell happened to the crypto-currency that the governments had no control over because it doesn&#039;t seem to exist down under.

				Do you guys have in Australia prepaid debit cards, which you can buy without ID, if yes, then I can advise one option, if not, than take a look at Bitcoin buying options here:<br /><br />http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins

				Hey there follow Australians =) I can accept Technocash, and fund your bitcoins. It takes 1-2 business days though. If any of you are interested, let me know...

				I purchased a Ukash voucher, transferred it to netteller online, transferred that to a virwox account that&#039;s linked to a second life account. I did this not that long ago, and I didn&#039;t have to provide any proof of ID to netteller, as long as my total transactions don&#039;t exceed $1000. The only issue I see here is that I was probably on camera at the place that I bought the voucher. You may or may not be able to just create multiple netteller accounts using tor under an alias without having to prove your identity. There is another thread on here that explains this process in detail. Search: &quot;Bitcoins Australia&quot;. Ignore this if the rules of netteller have changed.

				Here is some hope <br /><br />&quot;Dear Mt.Gox Users,<br /><br />Technocash Deposits are temporarily unavailable due to banking issues with the National Australian Bank (NAB). NAB are assisting Mt.Gox with this issue currently, and we will expect to have a resolution within five business days. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Mt.Gox Support&quot;<br /><br />I have talked with mtgox and they assure me they are fixing things.. but i am fairly stressed.. Their technocash account got SHUTDOWN by NAB and they gave me back all the money i put into it :/ FUCKING ANNOYING.. if i was only a bit faster that money would of got through..<br /><br />Need a new option ASAP.. i&#039;m stressed that this will be the end for aussie&#039;s.

Type in your postcode and press find. I found a few in my area that should support ukash. I called the nearest shop in my area that came up on the map, and they told me they can do ukash. So perhaps call the shop ahead, so you don&#039;t waste time, and if the operator doesn&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about, call another shop.<br /><br />I would tell you the area that I live, but I feel the less information about all of us on SR the better. I could be in Tasmania, or I could be in Broome or Mount Isa, or Alice Springs... Or next door.

				Don&#039;t interpret this as a personal attack, Jesusjoints (I read your angry post, too). Did you not read my suggestion In this thread? I did this not that long ago, and got my coins within about 6 hours from cash. It only took so long because I had to download all the blocks for my wallet, and the setup of all the accounts and second life took a while too. But I was able to do all of it after I got my ukash voucher from my computer chair. Now if you know something I don&#039;t, like netteller refusing to take aussies as of the last week or so, then by all means let us know.<br /><br />Credit for this method goes to profspudhed in this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1834.0.<br /><br />Send me a PM if you have any other questions.
