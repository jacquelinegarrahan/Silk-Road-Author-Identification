				I&#039;ve been meaning to ask this for a while now.&nbsp; Say you are using your firefox tor browser and logged into your SR account.&nbsp; Then say you open internet explorer or google chrome and log into personal accounts that can be linked to you such as bank accounts or email or social networking sites.&nbsp; Are you opening yourself up to being linked between your SR and tor activity to your personal accounts on the other internet browser program?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				Your MAC address is your computers identification number.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say it&#039;s like your computer&#039;s Social Security Number.&nbsp; That MAC address is your identifying mark, your computer and your computer ONLY has that particular address and it is leaked onto the internet.&nbsp; So yeah, it would be a bad idea to be doing that.&nbsp; I did it at first and now I know that it&#039;s a really bad idea so I only use one browser at a time.

				I should take heed of this... :\<br /><br />Two questions. 1, is it safe(er) to switch between the two browsers on the same computer? (open tor and broswe, close tor than open FF and browse, etc). 2, is it safe(er) to have two computers running off the same router, one dedicated to tor, the other to clearnet, but using both at the same time?

				Your MAC address is private and is non-routable, meaning it cannot be seen from the outside. Even if your MAC address was visible, the most they could determine from it is the manufacturer of your network card. Only your IP address can identify you, and TOR masks this.<br /><br />That said, it is still considered best practice to not have ANY other programs running at the same time as TOR that may communicate out, such as another web browser, instant messenger, gaming, etc.

It&#039;s worth noting... the future is now.<br /><br />In IPv4, MAC addresses do no propagate over a network or the internet. The only node that would know a machine&#039;s MAC is the router it was directly connected to.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br />In IPv6, the 64 bit &quot;host&quot; part of the full 128 bit address is usually generated from the MAC address of the connected NIC (NOT your modem/router). There are several sites that can prove this (like ipv6-test.com) and will show the MAC address of your current computer when you&#039;re using IPv6, and will try to determine the vendor given the public database of MAC address ranges, as assigned by IEEE.<br /><br />Now, to bring it back full circle - MOST people buy computers with credit/debit cards. If you look at the little label that is on the outside of nearly every computer box on the planet, you&#039;ll see a serial number for the machine itself as well as the MAC address. This information is logged when the manufacturer sells the computer to Best Buy or wherever else. It is logged again when the machine is sold to you. Meaning, if someone out there wanted to find you bad enough... it wouldn&#039;t be difficult - find out when that specific machine was sold, find the corresponding payment information and viola!<br /><br />Now, if you bought your computer with cash (not likely... but I guess it happens now and again), they still have a timestamp on the transaction and likely your face on camera. Just one step closer to finding you either way... Not sure how long most retailers keep video footage, but whatevs...<br /><br />.Hades.

But I don&#039;t think IPv6 is widely adopted yet. Still, the MAC address is only the identifier of the NIC, not neccessarily the computer, and a computer can have multiple NIC&#039;s, i.e. wired, wireless, USB dongle (removable), etc, each adapter has its own MAC address.<br /><br />I don&#039;t pretend to know how the security works, but I am also curious as to OP&#039;s question about how using a regular browser concurrently with TOR could compromise you.

				*closes other browser on clearnet*<br /><br />Thanks for clarifying!&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />I will just be on one or the other from now on.&nbsp; I guess one more question.&nbsp; If we are on tor browser why do people attach a written warning next to clear net links when they post them?&nbsp; Yeah the operator of the clear net site can see someone on tor (maybe) is on their site but so the fuck what, they can&#039;t figure out who it is correct???<br /><br />My basic desire is to be able to look at clearnet sites and tor sites on the same machine safely, and that would be clear net sites that I do not log into personal accounts on.&nbsp; Like maybe I want to google a drug and read about it, I shouldn&#039;t have to take the precaution of shutting tor down and looking up the drug on another browser would I?

				Good question. Can&#039;t say I know... I would only open the link in the TorBrowser anyway so.. lol. As far as googling stuff... why not just do it in the Tor Browser also? Alternatively, I have an iPad and an iPhone... I use their browsers a whole bunch when I&#039;m logged onto my liveCD for my SR activities. I know not everyone is so fortunate, but it&#039;s an idea :D<br />.Hades.
