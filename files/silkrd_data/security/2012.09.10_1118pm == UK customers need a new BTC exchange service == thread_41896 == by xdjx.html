				So with the recent demise of Intersango and our resident cash in the mail vendor Vlad (Been off the forums for a few weeks OMFG couldn&#039;t believe it, did this guy shoot the goose that laid the golden eggs...!?) the UK needs someone to step up to the mark and fix the UK BTC/SR economy.<br /><br />Sadly I am not this man, after thinking for weeks/months how I could pull this off since I know there is serious money to be made I keep drawing blanks.<br />The problems with this are the start up money and the gaining trust issue.<br /><br />What we need in the UK is a anonymous provider/exchanger who can exchange Ukash, Prepaid Visa, LR, Netteller or cash in the mail for BTC and preferably someone who doesn&#039;t gouge on price since we already pay a premium for SR prices and the SR fees.<br /><br />Doing exchanges without being registered is risky business and if you get too big eventually you will get caught, however a clearnet business with SR clients on the side seems doable. There is always the fraud issue to deal with where people try to convert to BTC quickly using stolen credit cards, paypals etc but things can be put in place for these such as clearance times.<br /><br />Really what im asking is: is there anyone who can step up and fill Vlad&#039;s shoes? Personally I get my BTC from 3 different exchangers, bank transfers to each and get the coins that way, I feel pretty safe since I only buy in the 4-6g&#039;s of weed per week but who is there for the vendors and the high-rollers?<br /><br />Ok TLDR; im pretty baked and wondering wtf went wrong in the UK over the last few months, maybe im trying to fix an unfixable problem but is there anyone who can step up and offer maybe this service to the UK customer base? Happy to offer any help that I can. Or maybe if there is anyone who is interested in trying this post in the thread and we&#039;ll see what happens.<br /><br />Cheers :)

				I used Intersango last month with no problems. What&#039;s been going on since then? I haven&#039;t heard any horror stories.

				Intersango are no longer accepting GBP transfers into their account. Used them myself for 5-6months but it&#039;s gotten bad recently and with them going down + the Vlad crazyness it&#039;s made getting BTC in the UK a problem.<br /><br />Definitely take a look at SLL&#039;s link&#039;s, will do so myself and report back soon.
