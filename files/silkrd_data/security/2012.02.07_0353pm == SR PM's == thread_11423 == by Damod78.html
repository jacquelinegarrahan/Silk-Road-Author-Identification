				&quot;All customers must use PGP. Any communications not in PGP will be ignored. My key is at the bottom of the page. If you order and then send your address unencrypted I will cancel your order and return your money.&quot;<br /><br />Just saw this on a vendors page and was wondering if sending messages through SR is encrypted?&nbsp; Or does the vendor only want e-mails with PGP?<br /><br />Vendor is Obamagirl, want to order some small orders from her.&nbsp; Seems on the up and up with good prices.

				Sr does NOT encrypt messages which is why the vendor wants you to use PGP while ordering and sending PM&#039;s.

				You can send a message on SR after your order is complete completely encrypted with pgp<br />You use the program Kleopatra that&#039;s bundled in the pgp4win package to encrypt the contents of a file or your clipboard with the public key of the vendor. The clipboard (or output file) then gives you something like<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (totalinsanitycryptowarlordhelldemonedition)<br />hQEMdfdfdfsd2f2ef2efef2je0fij2e0ifjej13j0fi130<br />2efej20f2je0fij2e0ifjej13j0fi130fjiej<br />-----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />Then the vendor can decrypt it with their private key only<br />And you can delete your message from SR sent box<br /><br />

				SR is responsible for their own security, not yours, and you cannot trust any other systems anyway. Peeps who aren&#039;t naive know this and take their own security into their own hands and use PGP. SR will not protect you.

				if SR were compromised all bets on the safety of your address are off, dunno how well implemented the encryption is, even if it&#039;s really solid, so what? there are plenty of potential vectors for getting at our addresses.<br />PGP means that nobody but the vendor can see your address no matter how much they want to (provided the vendor isn&#039;t compromised, but they were going to have to see it anyways)<br /><br />why take unnecessary chances

				Cryptography does more than provide confidentiality. It also provides integrity and authenticity, the latter being very important on a site like Silk Road.

				Not to hijack this thread or anything, but does anyone see a problem with using PGP desktop or PGP portable instead of GPG? I really don&#039;t feel like using command line tools to encrypt &quot;my address&quot; since all I plan on ordering is small amounts of bud.

				Ahh OK thanks. I thought for some reason that PGP desktop being commercial, closed source software made it unpopular or somehow shunned. PGP portable is a java based solution which is open source IIRC. It seems outdated, but it does the job. As long as there aren&#039;t any security-related bugs in it, that would be probably be my PGP of choice.
