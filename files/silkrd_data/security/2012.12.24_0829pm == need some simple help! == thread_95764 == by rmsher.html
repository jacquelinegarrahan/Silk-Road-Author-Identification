				I guess I could offer some advice, too. The cheapest way to get bitcoins is direct bank transfers to an exchange, but that&#039;s not anonymous and you&#039;d want to mix your coins before using them for anything illegal.<br /><br />Cash deposit to BitInstant has been the most popular method for months, but a lot of people are being asked for ID now.<br /><br />An increasingly popular method, and probably the best way going forward, is to buy directly off other people on localbitcoins.com or bitcoin-otc. I&#039;ve found people in my area who charge as little as MtGox price + 2%, and you can use a fake name, they don&#039;t ID.

But it doesn&#039;t matter, because as mentioned, you can&#039;t access MtGox over Tor. You could use public wifi, but if you access it from an IP address linked to your identity, your MtGox account is tainted and you need to mix your coins anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95764.msg680303#msg680303">Quote from: rmsher on December 24, 2012, 09:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">after I transfer the money thru bitinstant into mt gox is that when i use a coin tumbling service?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That would be the time.<br /><br />Another option I forgot to mention is that some people in this community, such as Captain Mal and Sugar Mama, will trade you bitcoins for cash in mail, Moneypaks and few other payment methods, but they charge as much as 10%.

				Instawallet is an intermediary like a mixing service, but nowhere near as safe. Some people believe it&#039;s enough to offer plausible deniability, ie, someone follows the bitcoin trail back from your SR address to an Instawallet address to the exchange. The exchange knows who you are but you can claim that you sent the coins to someone else, and as long as you access Instawallet over Tor, nobody can prove it&#039;s you.<br /><br />I&#039;m not particularly convinced of that method. I&#039;d rather not be identified in the first place, which is why if I bought coins in a non-anonymous way, I&#039;d properly mix them.
