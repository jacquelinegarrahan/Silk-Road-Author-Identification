				I&#039;ve created a dwolla account, added a bank about 4 days ago and it still won&#039;t let me verify.<br /><br />Do majority of banks (USA) not allow transfers to this site? Mine is a local bank.<br /><br />And i&#039;m interested in moneypaks, just not quite sure on how they work, do i just mail a certain amount of cash to receive one? Sorry i haven&#039;t really looked into it.

				Did you check your bank statement online? To verify, dwolla sends you two small deposits, ( a few cents each)to your bank, then you have to go on dwolla and enter those deposits in.

				dwolla took a week to get the funds in there for me.<br /><br />Moneypak you buy with cash at stores, grocery or convenience.

				Dwolla is a pain in the ass and when I try to use MT GOX there is like 3-4 accounts I have to open with several different people. The whole process is difficult and time consuming. From a business perspective its almost like they dont want customers to use their service because of how much of a pain in the ass it is.

				I also felt the sting of time/effort consumption going through the Dwolla-to-MtGox method. I&#039;m thinking of going with one of these BTC&#039;s-for-Monkeypak guys on SR. But I don&#039;t quite get all the details about Moneypak. Can someone clarify for me? Even their website left me a bit confused.<br /><br />I guess I dont understand the deal with the prepaid card and if it&#039;s necessary. So a Moneypak Prepaid card is different from a Moneypak? You can buy a Moneypak and then add the funds to a prepaid card... is this correct? Or do I need the prepaid card at all for SR purposes? When you buy a Moneypak at the store, what do you physically get? Like a slip of paper with a code on it or something? If someone could clarify all this for me, I&#039;d be much obliged.

				You can now deposit money into a number of major US banks and have it converted to BTC within less than a hour at the fastest, deposited directly into a tradehill, and I believe Mt Gox as well. Bitinstant runs this service. They have accounts at a number of these banks. You just initiate an order with them, deposit the money in one of their accounts, and they send BTC to your tradehill/mt gox as soon as they see the money. Dwolla is a huge pain in the ass by comparison. <br /><br />Cheers.
