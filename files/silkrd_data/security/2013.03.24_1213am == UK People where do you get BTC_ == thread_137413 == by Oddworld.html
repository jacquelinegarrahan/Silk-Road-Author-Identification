				these days I mostly use localbitcoins.com. it allows buyers and sellers to advertise. You choose a seller and place an order, they fund the escrow and then you pay into their bank account. Some will accept cash deposit if you are worried about anonimity or you can meet in person. I usually just make a bank transfer. I had my coins last week within 10 minutes. The site seems to have become much more efficient recently

				I used to use Btcxuk but they are far to slow these days taking between 1-3 days to get your coins, the guy that runs it must be mad because every one used to use them but hes lost me as a customer, the other day was my last purchase from them, jokers send them an email and 2 days later I&#039;m still waiting, coins go up you loose out, no good.<br /><br />I used pharma1 before but dont know if hes still kicking about.<br /><br />I need a fast vendor I will look on bitcoinslocal and let you know how I get on, got to be better than btcxuk, load of bollocks!<br /><br />

				Used pharma1 in past but his localbitcoins account shows no activity since early feb. There are plenty of other vendors. Like I say, you can get coins within a few minutes

				I did have a look at bitbargain but thought I needed ID? Suppose that doesn&#039;t matter anyway if I usually do bank transfer. Thanks for the other options will look into them the next time I am &quot;investing&quot; in BTC.

				So blockchain no longer accept UKBT, I can&#039;t use MTGOX since I don&#039;t have any utility bills , just bank statements which they don&#039;t accept and passport/driving license isn&#039;t enough for them. Cheapest on bitbargain for the low amount I want is Â£80 which I think is too much so is SR my only option then? <br /><br />I had a look on bitnordic too many fees &amp; I can&#039;t figure out bitcoin local...do I need to make my own ad?
