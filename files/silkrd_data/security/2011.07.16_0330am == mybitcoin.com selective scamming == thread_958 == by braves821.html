				Recently i have seen an influx of users (bitcoin forums) claiming to have had their accounts dumped from the online service.&nbsp; I havent seen anyone claiming to have issues with people who have downloaded the client but if you use mybitcoin.com as your wallet consider yourself warned.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also having an online wallet storing your funds is RETARTED but that is just my opinion.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				thats interesting... i actually just used mybitcoin.com for the first time a cpl days ago cuz the local wallet on my comp kept fucking up and i couldnt get all the blocks to download after hours of agressive forum searching for terminal tricks and whatnot. since i only convert what im going to immediately spend, i briefly considered sending directly from the bitcoin exchange into silk road, but i decided to kinda launder them through mybitcoin anyway just to be a little safer... had no problems whatsoever, but again, i didnt go for any period of time with btc just sitting around in the online wallet... all in all it was a way better experience for me than the local client imo. hmm... ~smod

				Yea, really! Btw, who runs mybitcoin.com&nbsp; anyways? Also, which forum are you referring to? When I had the option to use the web version or my own client, that was my first worry. Who has access to it? Also, I keep very little btc&#039;s in my online wallet anyways. I usually xfer out to my wallet then to usd. The only time that they sat for more than a couple days was when the btc dropped from 17 to 11 in a couple days. I decided to wait to see if i could recoup some of my losses, which I did.<br /><br />Other than that, btcs hit my wallet then boom they are to an exchanger for cash. I would do the same coming in. exchanger to my wallet then to SR asap.
