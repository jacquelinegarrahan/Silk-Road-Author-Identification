				Thanks for pointing this out. <br /><br />I had a feeling this kind of manipulation would go on in an unregulated market such as bitcoin. <br /><br />Too bad the SEC won&#039;t do a thing to stop it either. Bitcoin isn&#039;t a security recognized by the SEC, it&#039;s not even considered a currency to them (because it has no backing).<br /><br />The most you could do is fight fire with fire, or use this information to make some cash yourself.

That is very interesting to watch. <br /><br />You are right, it is an automated process that appears to have a .0000X shift in value up and down but seems to artificially maintain the price at about 9.8 it jumps around 9.8032X with listings of .01btc which if you tried to transfer across the bitcoin network would end up being .005 btc due to the fee for small amount transfers.<br /><br />Wonder what exactly is going on, are the forcing the price to stay at a given point or are they gaming the system with the .01btc sale knowing the person buying it will pay half in transfer fees.<br />

				Just to clarify, ALL currency markets are unregulated. Granted, if your trading via an exchange, depending on the country, the exchange itself is regulated but the Forex markets are not regulated.&nbsp; If you think this little trading Stratagy on Mt. Gox is manipulative you should check out the charts when the Swiss set a ceiling on the Frank earlier this year. The Forex mkts will be manipulated by CB&#039;s and the bitcoins market will be manipulated by big players, but it&#039;s all the same - how you hedge your ass.<br /><br />I would find it interesting if Mt. Gox is renting out network backbone space to traders. Don&#039;t think for a moment there won&#039;t be blackbox trading in bitcoins if there is ever much liquidity.

				What makes the BTC market so dangerous (and lucrative for those that know how to push a market around) is that volume is pretty thin for BTC&#039;s. If you have a couple hundred thousand bucks you could literally dicate the entire direction of the BTC price. <br /><br />You could put in a series of bigger sell orders and create panic... then buy at the bottom in bits and pieces.<br /><br />This happens in the stock market too. But traders that do it generally pick smaller volume stocks, so they have the largest bang for their buck<br /><br />It&#039;&#039;s harder to do in larger markets for, say, the Yen, or Dollar, or most other genuine currencies.<br /><br />But not impossible - George Soros is known for making pver a billion by &quot;Breaking the Bank of England (BOE)&quot; and making a shit ton of cash as the British Pound lost value when the BOE gave up supporting the currency.

				Cheers for the heads up mate.<br /><br />Seems to be quite a few people trying to manipulate the bitcoin market price atm, as long as SR&#039;ers keep there eyes on the exchange prices and volumes they should be able to avoid a massive loss during a crash by knowing that a large amount is/just got sold cheap or that a large investor is artificially pushing the prices down

An $800,000 buy order (or combination of orders) will raise the price to ~$12.25 and a 80,000BTC sell order will lower the price to ~$8.88).

				You can definitely make money in the currency markets, it just depends on how well you know yourself and your investment aptitude.<br /><br />Some people don&#039;t have the aptitude for short-term trading. If they don&#039;t realize it, they will lose everything. I for one had to move my investment horizon out longer-term before I found myself making money consistently.<br /><br />As a result, i&#039;ve made plenty of money betting the direction of a few currencies over the last few years. But I also took a much longer-term approach to it, and relied on very little leverage. <br /><br />Leverage is a double edged sword. It&#039;s great when times are good, sucks when they are bad. Forex let&#039;s people get insane leverage 20 to 1 or more. Even the banks blew up when they started leveraging that much. a 5% move against you and you&#039;re smoked.<br /><br />As for BTC, i don&#039;t really look at it as a serious money making opportunity long-term. I just quickly get in when I have to and then buy some goods off SR so i&#039;m not left holding anymore btc.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather my investing dollars go into real currencies, stocks, and bonds : )

				I don&#039;t get it sqlinjection. <br /><br />You don&#039;t believe in a God because you say there&#039;s no evidence? You have problems with them compartmentalizing their ideas, seeing it as irrational?<br /><br />Fine. I agree. But technical analysis has no evidence for it whatsoever. It is as popular as it is incoherant, I can&#039;t find two tech analysts that agree on the same interpretation of data or who can distinguish between real data and randomly generated data.<br /><br />Note to non stock market familiar newbies: Technical analysis is this numerology religion on the stock market that says you can use prior information on prices to make future predication.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t sound so bad as first.<br /><br />Except it&#039;s been practiced for centuries and I cannot find any evidence that it works. Neither can most economists. It sound right. It is wrong, so far as we can tell.<br /><br />Now, when I quiz technical analysts on this before, then they get mad and say I also belong to a religion: the efficient market hypothesis religion.<br /><br />But you know, even though it is true that EMH cannot be proven to be true, at least EMH people are able to make certain kinds of predictions (not about making profits, but things like reaction times to information) and by and large they are shown to be broadly correct.<br /><br />So, that to me is more scientific, being able to make a prediction and see if the results fit the idea.<br /><br />I&#039;m not claiming EMH is everything, not everything is explicable by it, but it is a powerful explanation for the big picture, much like evolutionary biology explains most, but not quite all, of specialization of species.

				@Pine,<br /><br />I agree with you about the astrology-esc nature of technical analysis (have you seen the charts that go crazy into fractals and music? They might as well be using a ouija board), however, like I mentioned, there is some good data on the very basic resistance/support levels as a function of price psychology.&nbsp; People cleave hard to the price points they&#039;ve bought and sold at.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now when you start talking about EMH that&#039;s where I&#039;ll break with you big time.&nbsp; Read &quot;This Time it&#039;s Different&quot; by Rogoff and Reinhart, especially their academic paper, and from a historical standpoint, 800 years of markets blowing themselves up, the idea of efficient markets is absurd.&nbsp; Tulips, 1873, 1907, 1914, 1929, the Swedish banking crisis, Iceland, Long-Term Capital Man, dot com bubble, 2007 until now.&nbsp; Rent seeking behavior combined with leverage combined with the mob mentality will always cause financial markets to self destruct.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now if you removed debt/leverage from the equation, including debt based money, as well as fractional reserve banking (which even Friedman argued for) then I think the EMH would have more solid footing.

				Thing is, is that bubbles and busts may not actually be irrational. Don&#039;t dismiss the idea immediately!<br /><br />I don&#039;t think of EMH in the way some people do, as in &quot;The Price Is Always Right&quot; philosophy, which is a misguided interpretation of the very basis of the conceptual framework of EMH in my opinion. It&#039;s like saying Evolution is the survival of the fittest, it&#039;s a soundbite, a too drastic simplification, not a real piece of information.<br /><br />My view is that EMH is about &quot;global level efficiency&quot;. <br /><br />To use an analogy, in globalization there are winners and losers, but the net effect of globalization is greater output for less input i.e. GDP growth. This is despite the obvious fact that jobs and entire industries, maybe even whole countries are devastated by global competition, which gives a highly misguided impression of the big picture that many people find hard to get their heads around mainly for psychological reasons, which is why the national socialists capitalize on this despite the greater egalitarianism that globalization brings. Define irony, there it is. Globalization implies the rise of Fascism, there&#039;s an ugly idea.<br /><br />Similarly, these &quot;inefficiencies&quot; people claim to see in EMH are actually local, not global. Not only that, but these local occurrences are highly transitory and peculiar in nature, by which I mean it is nearly always impossible to find the liquidity to make genuine trades to exploit those arbitrage possibilities, most EMH &#039;inefficiencies&#039; written about in whitepapers are retrospective, which does not improve my opinion of the economists who write them.<br /><br />We understand of course there is somewhat of a strange paradox that is difficult to fully articulate (that there are reasons why certain whitepapers won&#039;t be published...), but I think all participants in the markets can intuitively see the phenomena I mean even if they describe it using completely different language.<br /><br />A good example of this is the concept of Value. The truth is that if EMH was completely true i.e. strong form efficiency, then people like Warren Buffet would be out of business.<br />The truth is also that if EMH was completely wrong, then Buffet&#039;s stock would never have had a northward bias in the first place.<br /><br />This points to efficiency being a global phenomena. It is like when you stamp down into a puddle of water, the sides may surge upwards, but the main story is that a volume of air has mostly displaced a bunch of water in the middle. The droplets rain around, touching off little minor versions of the stamping of the puddle, but this information is completely junk, it is just a tiny mirror of a huge movement that is invisible.<br /><br />So something much stranger is going on, and it&#039;s not necessarily even weak form EMH either, I think it&#039;s a much more hairy thing, I look forward to the new economic theories in the 21st century, I think we&#039;re in the path of a huge upset or two that may not appeal to anybody in either camp.<br /><br />In particular I am struck by the convergence of the studies of Artificial Intelligence and Market Efficiency. I think I see a future where we see a New Synthesis between these fields of scientific endeavor which may bring startling observations about what it really means to be human.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Finally, my view is that people who think they can make a killing on markets, any markets, just because there could be inefficiencies are extremely misguided.<br /><br />Even if EMH is completely wrong, it does not follow for one second that you&#039;ll make money on markets. You may indeed do so. But it&#039;s a two sided coin, an implicit bet on markets going from inefficient to less inefficient. If you&#039;re putting money in, and you&#039;re right, and it goes in the other direction, then what? You are then depending on the roulette wheel.<br /><br />tldr; <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;In the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it&#039;s a weighing machine.&quot; -- BG</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />

				I love seeing thought experiments on entropy and systems theory relating to the markets/economies.<br /><br />Think of economies as systems.<br /><br />The more linked the system become, the more energy it takes to keep that system going. In other words, in order to stave off collapse, the system grows and becomes more interconnected (we go global). But as the system grows, its energy requirement skyrockets (more oil, gas, etc...). If the energy requirement for continual exponential expansion is not met, then entropy enters the system. And eventually, entropy will collapse the entire thing.<br /><br />Right now we are seeing energy requirements shoot up exponentially. It could easily outpace what we have in the next decade or two. If that happens, we will see economic entropy followed by collapse. In order to stave this off we need to see energy coming from seemingly unlimited sources (solar, wind, thermo, hydro). It takes about 100 years for an economy to switch from one energy source to another. So it could take 60-70 more years before our economy switches to a more unlimited source of energy.<br /><br />In the meantime, the system keeps growing, and so does its demand for energy.<br /><br />Who knows... maybe we&#039;re a decade or two away from the collapse.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the good times we&#039;re living through now is a blip in human history. One day the US won&#039;t be the dominant empire, people will prosper somewhere else, and one persons junk will turn into another mans gold.<br /><br />In the meantime, we might as well make some money : )<br />

There *are* reasons predicative strategies have a weird habit of suddenly collapsing and this is very consistent.<br /><br />Pretty much the first whitepaper on Finance ever, namely the Theory of Speculation paper published in 1900 by Louis Bachelier explains why this is so. The guy who wrote it discovered the underlying principal of Brownian Motion *five years* before Einstein and still wrote a better paper on it. This is a guy to be taken seriously. If you boil it right down to one sentence, he is saying that markets basically follow a random walk. The question you should be asking yourself, is why do they do that? And what is randomness in this context anyway?<br /><br />
