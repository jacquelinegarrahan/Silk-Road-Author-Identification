				I have a stack of brownies that I&#039;ve been saving for a rainy day. Won&#039;t get into that much, but I need to cool down big time. Was wondering how feasible/safe would it be to bring some brownies cooked with THC in my check-in luggage. I don&#039;t have any connects or mailbox where I&#039;m going so this is it.

				You&#039;re fine. They&#039;re just brownies. Dogs like brownies because they&#039;re brownies, not because they&#039;re weed brownies.<br />And are they going to stop every kid with brownies and try to make them cry and say they&#039;re really weed brownies? No.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t act nervous when you go through screening.&nbsp; 8)

				Drug sniffing dogs will be able to detect that no problem! Unless you pack it in MBB mylar bags and then wipe with alcohol after. What the dogs can smell is the oil that is in cannabis. Seeds contain this oil, weed, brownies, concentrates, and your fingers for that matter if you touched any of those items. So no, it is not safe to bring brownies to the airport. Yes, they won&#039;t go after every kid with brownies, but, if one of those kids has pot brownies there will be TSA agents all over your ass. As long as the dog smells it. And if someone sees brownies and wants an easy way to find out if there is drugs, they will call the dogs. It is fun for them to get to use their resources!

				I have flown maybe 30 times, and I have never once seen a dog in a airport.<br /><br />I have flown to 8 different countries, and no dogs.

Walked through a door past a German Shepard getting off a flight from Amsterdam in Munich with brownies in my briefcase without a problem. Had the FBI search my luggage (on an entirely unrelated issue) and they returned the brownies with everything else.&nbsp; Brownies in a ziploc are bulletproof, IMO. Biggest risk in checked luggage would be a hungry TSA agent.<br /><br />Not to be too cavalier, but as long as you half-assed seal up what you have, the dogs are not going to get it.&nbsp; Everybody&#039;s luggage smells like pot now whether you use it or not - just like every $20 bill has cocaine residue on it.

				Shipping a plate of brownies to a hotel is going to look way weirder than carrying a few snacks with you on a plane. Just package them up with a sandwich and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll sail through just fine. <br /><br />If anyone asks, tell them you&#039;re vegan or highly allergic to dairy or something, and need to bring your own food when traveling. <br /><br />I doubt you&#039;ll have trouble, though. &quot;Smuggling&quot; weed brownies is about as interesting to the TSA as someone bringing a few bars Xanax to get them through a flight.&nbsp; cantharidin knows what he&#039;s talking about.

Just as care packages when I was away from home. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s all that weird.
