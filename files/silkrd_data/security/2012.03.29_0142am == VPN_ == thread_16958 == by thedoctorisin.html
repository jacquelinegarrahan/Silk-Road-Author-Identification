				Hi all,<br /><br />Can anyone suggest a VPN service to utilize while using TOR?&nbsp; I assume folks get a moneypak and pay for it in that manner; however, I&#039;m open to any suggestions.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Why would you want to? Tor is it&#039;s own VPN your connection is encrypted while only using sites inside the network. Technically you would lose anonymity connecting to a VPN first, then launching Tor. Even the torproject site doesn&#039;t recommend this or the Tails Amnesic developers. <br /><br />Can always make your own private exit node, or your own VPN with a $4/mth VPS that takes bitcoins and configure tor to exit through it.<br /><br />Failing that, bitcoin wiki full of VPN providers:&nbsp; https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade<br />These guys do socks proxy to Tor: http://torvpn.com<br /><br />Keep in mind you are now trusting they aren&#039;t secretly decrypting your traffic and reading it in the clear. Also don&#039;t get a PPTP VPN they are useless, only OpenVPN

				I would recommend Mullvad, they accept bitcoin or try nVPN.com they will take LR both anonymous forms of payment, <br /><br />although VPN is told not to be used with tor it is another layer of anonymity if you are accessing internet from a source that is not your home or anything that has to do with you.

				<br />Logging on to a VPN and then using TOR as usual (running on your computer), the VPN provider can only see you&#039;re communicating with TOR nodes, that&#039;s it.<br /><br />Maybe what the developers meant is that a VPN provider (if malicious) could in theory redirect your connections, connect you to a rogue TOR network and sniff your data like that.<br /><br />I trust my VPN provider to not be part of such a big conspiracy, so I&#039;m sleeping better knowing there is one extra layer and I&#039;m not communicating with TOR nodes from my home connection, but another server in another country that probably a dozen other people combine with TOR as well, making it more difficult for LE to tell them apart, even with advanced techniques.<br /><br />I agree, it&#039;s still a dilemma for those who don&#039;t know their providers because what-if. But I find it more probable that LE would keep adding more TOR nodes and catch a few people than to pick on a few VPN providers and make them set up a rogue TOR network and do whatever LE wants without a specific warrant.<br /><br />

				You can get GnuPG from here fella: http://www.gpg4win.org/ <br /><br />When you download it make sure you download everything in the package (GPA is the main one you will need). Also as well if you haven&#039;t got it already get TrueCrypt, that way you can encrypt your hard drive and create encrypted containers too. If you have a virus then just reformat your hard drive. Job&#039;s a good&#039;un! Best antivirus I can recommend is Kaspersky Pure 2.0 (it the most comprehensive antivirus I have found) and finally get HideMyAss VPN and you should be good to go. :)<br /><br />Shoot me and PM if you have any questions about the above.

				I don&#039;t understand something. How exactly does VPN combine with tor? Both originate on one&#039;s computer, you download the VPN software and click on it from your ISP&#039;s connection and are routed through a secure tunnel that exits through a server in maybe another country.

				Hidemyass logs everything and gives the logs to law enforcement at the drop of a dime, don&#039;t you remember that lulzsec dude who got busted using them?<br /><br />If you use VPN to Tor, you exit from the VPN to the Tor entry guard. I am not sure how to explain it. The VPN software routes your outgoing traffic through the VPN servers, your outgoing traffic initiates a Tor circuit from an entry guard, so the last VPN node connects to the entry guard and then the Tor circuit extends from there.

				Hi,<br /><br />I am using a VPN first before connecting to Tor. Regarding to the TOR Wiki about TOR+VPN (https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN) it&#039;s not a bad idea to route your TOR Traffic through a VPN.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you -&gt; VPN/SSH -&gt; Tor<br /><br />You can route Tor through VPN/SSH services. That prevents your ISP etc from seeing that you&#039;re using Tor. Generally, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won&#039;t stand out as much. SSH tunnels are not so popular.<br />Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine&#039;s default Internet connection, and the Tor Browser Bundle will route through it.<br />This can be a fine idea, assuming your VPN/SSH provider&#039;s network is in fact sufficiently safer than your own network.<br /><br />Another advantage here is that it prevents Tor from seeing who you are behind the VPN/SSH. So if somebody does manage to break Tor and learn the IP address your traffic is coming from, but your VPN/SSH was actually following through on their promises (they won&#039;t watch, they won&#039;t remember, and they will somehow magically make it so nobody else is watching either), then you&#039;ll be better off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

Fifty quid is a small price to pay.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Â£50!!! where you buying from? I pay 6$ for one of the most secure vpn services available a month.<br /><br />A vpn in combination with TOR is awesome takes anonymity to a whole new level.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I only pay Â£50 a year dude. Doesn&#039;t seem overly expensive to me. I use HMA pro.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do you really think it is wise to tell people which entry nodes you are using? Especially since the last criminal who publicly said they used hidemyass got raided shortly after ??
