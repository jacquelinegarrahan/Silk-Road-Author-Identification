				When I try to go to either bitinstant or blockchain on tor the pages stop loading before I can do anything useful. When I go to bitinstant the entire page loads except the part in the middle that is used to actually make a transaction, and it freezes there every time. When I go to blockchain.info/wallet it loads but when I click &#039;login&#039; it stops loading before the login option pulls up, and it freezes at that exact spot every time, just like bitinstant.<br /><br />I have been to both of these sites before with no problems, in fact I went there two days ago with no problem. I can load my instawallets, SR, obviously the forum, and startpage works, but bitinstant and blockchain won&#039;t work. I closed tor, tried the sites on the clearnet and they both worked fine. Restarted tor and they still aren&#039;t working. <br /><br />Any help would be appreciated. <br /><br />TD

				Hmm, I literally just visited both those sites. I even got a new identity and still can access those sites. Can you try manually getting a new identity? I was having issues logging into SR the past few days and a new identity fixed it every time. I would also check and see if you need to update your TOR as well.

				in the last 2 days did u do anything with the script button? like forbid scripts globally? if you did forbit scripts, then click on the script button when u r on bitinstant, and enable some of the bitinstant scripts. sorry i cant be more specific. but i was having same issues, and i fixed it by playing around with the script enabling. Hopefully it helped.
