			<dd class="postbody">
				I usually use torrent systems to download my music, movies and tv. i typically use demonoid w/vuze to get everything, but recently i&#039;ve added some search templates to vuze so now i pull torrents from a variety of sites. About a month ago i started getting emails from my cable company reporting that i have violated the copyright law and this was a warning because they got my ip address from me downloading a few movies. it never happened with anything but movies, and most of them were already out on dvd. i didn&#039;t check my mail til i already had about 8 or 9 of these letters so i haven&#039;t downloaded anything since. But i was wondering if there was a way to use tor to get these torrent files and not get noticed? the torrent sites usually advertise private downloading services but they all cost money. excuse me if i sound a little dumb with this, i&#039;m not sure what i can do and i thought maybe this encrypted site could help me get away with that. thanks for any help.<br />bd

				Not to mention you really need to know what you are doing to not leak your IP address if you torrent with Tor, which you shouldn&#039;t be doing anyway. If you want to get torrents anonymously buy a VPN or a seedbox.

				Yea if you try to download torrents through TOR you&#039;re gonna have a bad time. If you want to stay anon while downloading torrents use Peerblock and pay for a torrent friendly VPN like ipredator www.ipredator.se

				I don&#039;t mess with torrents anymore. Just recently, and before I even heard of Tor,&nbsp; my internet service was interrupted because I downloaded a video game ( Far Cry 2... didn&#039;t even work ) For music, torrents are a waste of my time. Use Soulseek! I&#039;ll help you with it if you need assistance. I filled up my iTunes with over 18k songs in a few days. Over 3k songs in one day when I first got Soulseek. <br />

				thanks for the info guys. i don&#039;t do anything else while i&#039;m on tor. and i definitely won&#039;t d/l any torrents after reading that. I&#039;m not really worried about downloading music or tv shows cause i&#039;ve done plenty of that and never got any warning letters, but the movies seem to be the big thing now. so there&#039;s no way to privately download w/out buying something? and for the guy who mentioned the direct download, couldn&#039;t they just get the same info from doing that? cause if that&#039;s all i have to do, demonoid offers direct downloading now instead of just torrents so that&#039;d be sweet if it worked.

				I am not entirely sure how they have direct download implemented, but if it is a single client to server connection, it should be a lot safer. Torrents are even less anonymous than normal P2P leeching, your IP address is public to an entire publicly viewable swarm of people instead of just a single server / peer that you are downloading from.

				Encryption is what you want, like encrypted data. That means the ISP know your downloading stuff but all they can see are encrypted packets of data. Job done. Check out how to do it on whatever torrent client you are using - but downloading torrents through TOR not good.

Denmark, Norway and Sweden is Scandinavia. Well you are somewhat right Sweden is a lot cheaper than Norway, but then again Sweden is lot more draconian when it comes to drugs than both Norway and Denmark. Denmark is the least strict on drugs. So my choice to would be Denmark how they treat filesharing idk though. The Swedes who are supposed to be neutral have always loved to lick uncle Sam&#039;s ass even more so then Norway and Denmark&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Never use Tor for torrents.<br /><br />Move to something else then torrents. Chances are that your ISP is not actively monitoring your connection, but is acting upon DMCA notices and stuff like that. Since you can see all IP&#039;s using a certain torrent, it&#039;s quite easy to automatically send these notices out (and they do, I used to get them all the time when I didn&#039;t filter out torrent traffic on my tor node). Use the direct downloading sites mentioned before. Or use Usenet, which you can get for a couple of bucks a month (and they often offer an encrypted connection for free, so your ISP can&#039;t see what you&#039;re doing even if they want to).

				Again, I recommend seedboxes for torrents.&nbsp; It&#039;s like using someone else&#039;s computer to do your downloads...and especially your seeding uploads, which is usually how IP&#039;s catch you anyway.&nbsp; But yeah, never use Tor for this purpose...it&#039;s not right, and way too slow anyway....
