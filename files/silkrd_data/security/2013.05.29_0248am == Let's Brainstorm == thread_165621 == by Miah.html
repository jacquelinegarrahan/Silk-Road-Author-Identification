				Ok so based on the events of today with Liberty Reserve it would seem that the Government is cracking down on so called &#039;money transmitters&#039;. It was big headlinenews story on CNN. I&#039;m sure the guys involved in the bust are now thoroughly sucking each other off but that&#039;s another matter, I digress. So let&#039;s say however that one day they do succeed completely and it becomes impossible to purchase or sell bitcoins without being viewed as a criminal. What&#039;s the strategy then?<br /><br />I have a few ideas(kinda far fetched) but as I was driving I thought to myself if someone could create a system or application that&#039;s anoymoized that will allow you to make financial transactions. See with Liberty Reserve there was a huge trail to follow. Money had to come from some account to purchase said bitcoins or make payouts but what if someone developed an anonymous banking service. I know if someone was ever successful in that it would probably go hand and hand with Silk Road. But then again with an&nbsp; banking service you could have terrorists using it to transfer money to fund attacks againest our country( that&#039;s what the government would say). Spent the past couple of days just reading about all the new money laundering acts, Patriot act, and each countries anti-laundering money programs. It just seems to be that the answer would be an anonyomized banking website/app. We could apply the same concepts use for Tor and Silk Road and refactor them. That&#039;s not something I can do and I&#039;m not sure if what I&#039;m suggesting is even possible hence the brainstorm session! Would love to hear what some better minds think about this&nbsp; ;D
