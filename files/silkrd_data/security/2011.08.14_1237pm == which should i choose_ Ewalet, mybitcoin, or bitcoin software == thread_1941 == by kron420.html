				mybitcoin is dead. local bitcoin software stores transaction history. i would use instawallet or other online wallet where you don&#039;t have to give name etc to store bitcoins headed for the SL. you could also put them through a tumbler.<br /><br />connecting to bitcoin through tor using the local client from bitcoin.org is no good. local transactions (sends and receives) are recorded.

The entire transaction history since the beginning of bitcoin is stored in the block chain, not just your local client. Even transfers between online wallets are stored. You are best off using a local client and storing your coins offline on a thumbdrive in cold storage. No local client asks you for your name. Using another online wallet just puts you at risk of losing coins once again. Ask the thousands of people that used mybitcoin how that worked out for them. Again I ask, would you hand your physical wallet to some stranger on the street and say &#039;hang on to this for me bro!&#039;

				I came to this post to recommend MyBitCoin.com !<br /><br />Check out their website about how to get 49% of the money you sent them returned.<br /><br />Giving your money to MyBitCoin.com is a much better investment than the housing or stock market.<br /><br />Sending money to MyBitCoin.com is four times as profitable as farming.<br /><br />If only I could have put my retirement savings into MyBitCoin.com<br />

If you however send the money to an online wallet, and then send it from there (through Tor) to the SL account, there&#039;s no record on YOUR computer (assuming history is wiped) that YOU send the money to SL.<br /><br />Or am I missing something...<br /><br />EDIT TO ADD:<br /><br />Tor and online wallet like InstaWallet provides anonymity in a sense that once you send the money there, it is anyone&#039;s guess who is in control of that wallet. Where as the local wallet is by definition in your control.<br /><br />EDIT TO ADD 2:<br /><br />Nothing wrong with keeping your coins locally until you&#039;re ready to send to SL. However, sending through Tor+InstaWallet breaks the chain of custody basically. So instead of Your Wallet =&gt; SL, do Your Wallet =&gt; InstaWallet =&gt;SL.<br /><br />EDIT TO ADD 3:<br /><br />Imagine this scenario: You get busted (cuz postal inspector found your drugs in the mail) and they do controlled delivery. They have your computer, an they some how got your SL account. They look at your local wallet and see a transfer to a SL wallet under your account.<br /><br />Now scenario 2: Same as above, except your wallet transferred to an instawallet. From they you claim you paid a dude for roses, not drugs on SL. How can they prove otherwise if there&#039;s no record who controlled the intermediate wallet?<br /><br />ANyways, I recommend doing an extra hoop through InstaWallet or coin tumbler, preferably both :)
