				I have no personal experinces with packages getting intercepted however from what I understand --<br /><br />If the package was shipped to you internationally and its intercepted it will most likely be what people call a &quot;Love Letter&quot; from customs talking some stuff about <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Hey random-person we got this package with some illicit shit in it, it was probably a mistake that you recieved it, but if it wasnt a mistake then come claim it so you can go to jail.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds close enough.<br /><br />Did the USPS workers find it? Most likely it got stolen and the box was destroyed and your package will linger forever &quot;in-transit&quot; or something like that.<br /><br />Drug dogs at USPS?<br /><br />Very low personal amount?<br /><br />Probably going to go into a &quot;drug vault&quot; which is where all their seizures of low amounts go? Something like a evidence locker of all the shit they found?<br /><br />What if its a larger amount?<br /><br />Now you are probably going to be the target of a decent sized investigation to make sure that when they do get ready to pin some shit on you it is some good shit that they can make stick. <br /><br />Like I said I don&#039;t have personal experince, and I am going to assume aside from the customs &quot;love letter&quot; that most of the people who were victim to the &quot;more&quot; might not be able to log in and tell you? Just some things to think about, it really isn&#039;t instant and they don&#039;t just raid people like crazy for little or no reason. (ok sometimes they have wrong information but that doesn&#039;t seem to be the normal.)

				thank you for your helpful input. if your small product is seized and placed in the &quot;drug vault&quot; what do you suppose they do with the address it was going to? not bother? sent it to the feds, and they wont bother?

				If US customs seizes your package you get a nice letter in the mail stating what type of controlled substance they found and what code or regulation you broke.&nbsp; The letter also gives you the opportunity to elect that you acknowledge that you were the correct recipient for that letter and it&#039;s contents.&nbsp; I hope no one in their right mind would send back the letter stating that the contents were theirs but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s someone out there that dumb.<br /><br />Now once you get one of these letters I would change the drop point for packages immediately because if you get another one of these letters after the fact.&nbsp; You can be sure there will be some nicely dressed men knocking on your door in the next weeks to come.

				It&#039;s hard to say, seeing as its not my department... I have had a couple experiences with opened packs; two in fact.<br /><br />1) Plastic vials neatly arranged on a letter sized envelope was opened at one end and covered with inspection tape. The ampoules were not labeled and I assume that they didnt want to go thru all the tedium and trouble of sorting out what to do with it so they just sealed &#039;er up and moved on. I received and was a little sketched out what with all the red tape, but there were no repercussions. :)<br /><br />2) Some douche sent me an empty envelope with some 20 pills in it wrapped in one sheet on 8 x 11 paper. The entire lot arrived in a larger envelope obviously from the county of origin, again with the red tape. The smaller, inner envelope was cut open, but alas no red tape. I can only guess that the pills were not noticed when the small envelope was opened. I really lucked out ( well not really just some k-pins)<br /><br />Just think that most postal workers are just like you and me. They want a pay check, probably hate their job and want to get through the day hassle free. And maybe just a tad lazy&nbsp; :D<br />You have very little to worry about given what you have previously stated about your case, just hang tight my friend
