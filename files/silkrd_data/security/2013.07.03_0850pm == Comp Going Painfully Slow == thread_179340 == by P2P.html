				Recently (within the last few months), I started on Tails and encrypted my OS to boot (don&#039;t know why I did this instead of encrypting the whole system partition. I&#039;m not sure if this OS encryption covers RAM or not, but that was the whole point of my encrypting it). I don&#039;t think Tails has anything to do with my latest issues, unless it is a problem with the amount of RAM I allocated to it (how can I edit this in tails?). I believe it has something to do with the truecrypt encryption of my OS. It has gotten extremely slow, so much so that it is not even usable anymore. I cannot wait half an hour each time I start up my computer. That is simply ridiculous. I remember truecrypt warned of this during the encryption process, but when I was finished I did not have any problem with the fact that it took slightly longer to start up. That was the way it started. <br /><br />However, now (and I do not know what caused this), my system is impossibly slow and cannot even start up without a substantial wait. Also, sometimes when I start up and finally get logged in, half of my system looks like vista, and the other half (bottom bar) looks like safe mode or Windows 1998. I also noticed, though, that after the substantial wait time it takes for the comp to start up, prompt me with the normal windows login screen (this is after I have entered my truecrypt password and started up, mind you), and get me logged in with all of the programs starting up, it is as fast as it always was. However, it takes about forty-five minutes to an hour for the comp to get to this point. Obviously, this is not practical, so I am wondering what I can do to fix this issue. I thought about decrypting, but I was not even sure if that would work. I did not want to decrypt if it would not fix anything, since decrypting in and of itself would take days, just as encrypting did. <br /><br />Please, if anyone has had a similar issue and resolved it, or knows of a way to fix this problem, you will be saving me a lot of grief and, eventually, a lot of money. I use my comp for several things and I need it to be ready and fast on the fly. This problem will eventually lead to me having a serious expense on my hands, which I cannot have right now.

				Does it still run slow if you boot from your regular OS? (not Tails) <br /><br />I&#039;m betting the slowness has to do with the OS encryption, but I&#039;m not an expert in this. <br /><br />Another thing you could try, if your computer runs normally with the regular OS, would be to just do another install of Tails on another USB (unencrypted, of course). I&#039;m suggesting this because, as you said, unencrypting the OS would take days. It would be interesting to see if the computer performs any better with the unencrypted OS.<br /><br />Now if your computer runs slow with the regular OS, then the problem is with your computer
