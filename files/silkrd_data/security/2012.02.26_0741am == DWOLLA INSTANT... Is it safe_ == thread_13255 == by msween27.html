				Is anyone using DWOLLA INSTANT?&nbsp; Is it a security risk?&nbsp; Tired of waiting 2-5 days for transactions to clear but don&#039;t want them looking any closer into my account.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just being paranoid?

				Bump, I feel the same way. Gonna err on the side of caution though because to enable this they want your SS# and they do a credit check..forget that.

				I use mtgox and haven&#039;t provided ID. And Dwolla already has your bank account info, which you had to set up with a SSN. If you don&#039;t have legit fake ID then that bank account is tied to you already. Buying bitcoins is not illegal. Once you send your btc out of mtgox what do they care? It&#039;s out of their hands by then. I&#039;m sure if you&#039;re running 10k+ through there a month they may wonder but always have an explanation. Speculating on bitcoins, etc. One of your buddies just got into bitcoins and didn&#039;t want to set up an account. You buy them and then send them to his wallet and he pays you cash. <br /><br />No profit, no IRS right? (I could definitely be wrong about this, it&#039;s a questions)

				Of course they have, and any legit company would. Again, buying bitcoins is not illegal. What are they going to turn you in for? Sending your bitcoins to an SR wallet is also not illegal. There are books and music instruments and everything else here. Now, if you&#039;re not using a mixer and you get busted for something else and they use that as evidence well that could be a problem but you&#039;d have to be busted for something else because everything through mt gox is kosher.
