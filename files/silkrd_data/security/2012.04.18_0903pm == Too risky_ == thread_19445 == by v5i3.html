				I&#039;ve read the &#039;The complete All-in-one-Guide on how to be anonymously at SR (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0).<br />So I got really helpful information but I am asking if the high expenditure of being anonymous is&nbsp; really necessary, especially if I &#039;just&#039; want to buy a small amount of LSD, which is quite harmless to ship.<br />I mean of cause the more you try to be anonymous the more security you get. But is it really risky to deal on SR with your own PC (without a liveUSB) and buying Bitcoins not at MT.Gox and with your real contacts.<br /><br />I just want to try LSD once, I am not interested in risky drugs like cocaine and others... Can I assume the risk?

				Yeah the way i see it is, however small the chance of getting busted is it is still there. would you rather skimp on not even a few hours of work to reduce the chance by as much as you can? <br /><br />

				LE normally attacks the weakest link in a chain - that is probably low level users. Once they get busted they<br />infiltrate the network and wait for a big fish to make a mistake.<br /><br />You make SR a better place by taking your security seriously. That&#039;s my opinion anyway.

Am I wrong? <br />I acted probably a bit to quick, because I bought already some Bitcoins at a german BTC market. At this BTC market I have an account with my real contacts. <br />Are this Bitcoins useless if I want to use them for SR when I want to be anonymous? <br />If so, aren&#039;t there some ways to make these Bitcoins anonymous?<br /><br />

				As there were no new answers since my last reply I found on my own:<br /><br />using Bitcoinfog would be a way to make my Bitcoins anonymous. Is this enough?<br /><br />It&#039;s also often recommended to shuffle Bitcoins, but I don&#039;t know how to do that effectively. <br />Create some new addresses at my Bitcoin programm and transfer them to each other? <br />

				I didn&#039;t mean to sound condescending in my earlier post. Buying bitcoins from a verified address is ok in my opinion - as long as your just buying for personal use.<br /><br />After that use a service like instawallet; https://www.instawallet.org/w/iIDIOCZIgAIStFAo0B_XoA<br /><br />You can move to a Mt. Gox account after that etc. etc. Or you could just use a service like BitCoin fog;<br />http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/<br />

				I know about bitcoinfog now. <br />The thing I don&#039;t get is how to withdraw them. Should I withdraw them directly to the SR address or should I first transfer them back to my eWallet??<br />To be anonymous I should transfer them directly from bitcoinsfog to SR, shouldn&#039;t I?
