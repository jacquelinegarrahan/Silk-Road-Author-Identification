				Just heard that at least some people who ordered drugs from the farmers market have gotten cease and desist letters from the DEA informing them that if they continue to order scheduled substances they will be arrested. In a way that is a good sign for them, it means they probably are not going to be arrested for having ordered substances from the farmers market. I bet they wish they used fake ID boxes, it is a safe bet that their mail is going to be watched if anyone has their mail watched. This clearly highlights one of the advantages of using fake ID boxes...none of them had DEA visit them but clearly the boxes they used are known to DEA and thus if they used real boxes they are now known to the DEA as illegal drug buyers.

				Reminds me of the letters sent out by the CPSC/ATF to people buying illegal firework making shit online not too long ago. In that case, it was more of a scare tactic than anything else, although I can imagine they&#039;d try some kind of action if the address kept coming up.

As happy customer I tried to warn them, but they did not want to listen. What is happening now is a &quot;people thing&quot;, where the US are applying nothing but refined torture on the people they got their hooks in, and under torture most people fold. Just look at this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24047.msg253136#msg253136<br /><br />Now go figure. We&nbsp; can safely assume that all computers, databases and passwords from TFM are in the hands of US authorities. <br /><br />The Authoritarians are fighting for their existence, and they have access to draconian measures. Look, the US system for &quot;justice&quot; is completely corrupt. They routinely sentence innocent people to death. They are for all practical purposes to compare with the Inquisition. You can just guess what kind of pressure they put on the poor victims from TFM. And we can assume that every single one of them have folded under that pressure.<br /><br />Now guess what kind of investigative power they mobilize to hit SR! I am certain that they order from here routinely, and then scan for DNA on the letters. They always work that &quot;people thing&quot;, so if they find DNA from someone they can identify, they will monitor those people, and ultimately put pressure on them.<br /><br />There is one measure all suppliers should take, and that is to contaminate all shipments with DNA from all sources they can get. Buy some meat, chicken fish and such, mill it in a mixer, dry to cake on low temp, and mix again to fine powder. Immerse all packages in the powder and pat them off.<br /><br />...to be continued...

				...continued...<br /><br />If you want to be safe you have to ASSUME that SR is completely compromised by gov goons. If there was a snitch or two inside TFM all the time, we can be certain that nobody will talk about it. If SR is owned, we will never hear about it, not even after the bust. <br /><br />This is the way the world works. They hate us and they have all the time and money in the world to spend to get us. If they fail its just another boring day in the office. If they win they get face time on prime TV. If we win, it is just another peaceful delivery. If we fail even once, we will rot in prison. <br /><br />Everyone: There is only one rule and that is: This is a &quot;people thing&quot;. They use torture to make people talk. Life in prison is equal to torture. Even 5 years in prison is something most people would negotiate to avoid. <br /><br />Buyers: Always Cash in Mail. If they kill cash go for gold and silver. Always a dead-end dropbox for deliveries. Figure this one out yourselves.<br /><br />Sellers: Dont leave anything that could lead them to a live person. DNA is the worst one.

I was not being a smart ass. I used a friend to get deliveries when I started on the road, but she started to get nervous and asked that it not happen any more. I was just trying to see how a super security conscious guy goes about the most vulnerable part of the exchange: the delivery site. The forums are all full of suggestions for this. I do have a hundred posts but lots of them are asking questions to better understand.<br />Kmfkewm and Pine are my all time heroes on the forums and I did risk getting flamed for asking a newbie question. While sarcasm and I have an intimate relationship, my last post was meant to be like a student of photography asking Ansel Adams what camera is his favorite. I got to use my first positive karma point...and it went to kmfkewm because he just used his little candle instead of the megaton flame thrower that he reserves for his professional rivals when they mess up

As soon as you accept the package you will be arrested. They don&#039;t need to wait for you to resell anything. They probably don&#039;t even need to wait for you to accept the package, but they tend to try and get you to sign for it and open it.

				^^^ Ah yes this is true but its situational.... most importantly USPS is going bankrupt and they have serious shit to deal with like Kilos, money, guns, etc.. not everyday small shit... and second an acquaintance of mine was arrested from an intercepted package.. everything was thrown out because there was no overwhelming evidence it was for him? what stopped anyone with knowledge of his name sending a pack to his location?? Yes its not a good idea and if you can stay away but unless your doing serious shit then you have no need to worry.. I have had a love letter myself for something I consider quite large and many thought would be enough to arrest me but I literally LOL&#039;ed at it cause it isn&#039;t shit compared to what there actually looking for...have used that drop for a FUCK ton of drugs so trust me its not under watch or I&#039;d been popped awhile ago... while paranoia does help and being safe is everything... paranoia is just that!!!

				I don&#039;t like to argue and I&#039;m out after this word but just wanted to correct you ;) ... just because the DEA arrests you does not mean you are guilty!! Doesn&#039;t mean shit actually until Court and they have to prove everything and just just guilty but guilty beyond reasonable doubt!!! Time to smoke out and chill out!! Be safe people!!

				It has been said before, but I will echo it one more time: this is why you use PGP! If LE ever gets its hands on the SR server, they will not be able to read PGP encrypted addresses.

				Now they claimed that they deleted addresses as soon as delivery was confirmed at TFM (same as SR claiming addresses are deletes as soon as orders are put &quot;in transit&quot;) does anyone know if the receiving of letters corresponds to &quot;open&quot; orders when TFM went down or were the letters from past business. I read one reference to a canadian vendor there (only one I remember was farmer bob, that might not be the right nym, but the point stands that there was only one canadian vendor) and his business was all long closed and he wasn&#039;t active on their forums for months before the bust. It would be nice to find out if there is any connection between the people who got letters (other than they were on TFM and still use the same address)

Let me just say that I have never seen someone fucked for using a fake ID mail box but I have seen countless people who were protected by doing so. The people getting threatening letters from the DEA due to their farmers market orders are the most recent example, the people who had shit sent right to their houses are stressing out now because their real life identities are linked to farmers market, but the people who used fake ID boxes have dropped their old ones and gotten new ones, maintaining unlinkability of themselves to farmers market.

				My .02 worth on the subject: First of all, you must have positive photo id to open a mailbox either usps or other services. I believe they want a drivers license and one other form. If you don&#039;t have a dl they will take other things but they are fairly thorough about it. If you have a good source of fake id then good on you. Make sure your box is in an area where there are no cameras.<br /><br />I do not recommend using a vacant house, or something similar. it will work sometimes and other times it wont work. The mail carriers are encouraged to know their customers and normally know the names of everyone on the route. You might get lucky and get a new carrier but people who count on luck soon run out. What happens when the carrier sees &quot;james doe&quot; on the letter when he knows no one by that name lives there? He might drop it in the box and he might send it back. The return addy is fake and a buyer screams he did not get the goods and the seller is a scam.<br /><br />The other thing that happens is a house goes vacant, the mailman picks up on that right away. First he sees junk mail piling up in the box, then at some point he makes a notation and no more mail gets delivered. If someone picks up the mail he will sometimes ask neighbors if anyone is living there. Its a gamble unless you are sure they will deliver to a certain name and no forwarding address has been made.<br /><br />You put your correct name and address on it and lets say the worst case scenario, its a set up or they discover it and do a controlled delivery. OK, if you do not sign for it, they can not execute a warrant just on it being put into your mailbox. This i&#039;ve heard from people who are lawyers as well as postal people. If there is no sig, they need some other proof that you knew what it was. Taking it inside might be enough for a warrant to be executed, that is a maybe. They might come to the door a little while later and ask you questions hoping you will lie about the delivery, then they come in. Or just come in no matter what you say. If the package is unopened and you told them yes you got a package you were not expecting, you may get off. But what if they search the place and find other stuff? They have you on that.<br /><br />My theory is do not order anything that you have to sign for. Secondly, when it comes do not rush out and take it in. Let it cool in the mailbox, come and go a few times which allows you to look out for surveillence and wait till after dark to take it in. If it was a set up they will not wait that long they will come knocking. I can&#039;t see a 24 hour watch on a small amount of drugs. If you got in a key of coke then you got bigger balls than me and they might watch that for a week. If you are super duper paranoid, when you do go out and find the letter/ package you can do a little act like &quot;what is this??&quot; and write on it &quot;return to sender&quot; and put it back in the box waiting a little longer. Or bring it in at that point and let it cool by the door unopened. Depends on your level of paranoia and how big a shipment you got.

				i started a thread a few days ago about a dea letter i received on friday&nbsp; i believe. although i was a former patron of TFM, i always bought domestically and only a few times. i do not feel this letter i received is about tfm. i was using another company in canada for many months and feel that based on the last few dealings i had with them going wrong, it is about that company and not tfm. i also had a phone conversation from a postal inspector a few months back about tfm and a purchase i made and believe me, they didnt get everyone (at least at that point) and didnt want me, as a small buyer. he wanted intel that of course i couldnt provide.&nbsp; the letter i received was not my address nor my name, however i have used both my real name and address as its not always possible to use anything else.

It is because I spoke to this inspector thati dont think that this letter is regarding TFM, although i could be wrong. The letter i received talked about receiving international orders, which I didnt place using TFM. I only ordered domestically from them. PBP however is in Canada and I was using them for a while.

That kind of information is totally useless. Everyone consumes small amounts of illegal or diverted prescription drugs from time to time, and most have to make purchases to acquire the drugs they consume.

They can tell immediately if you&#039;re using a fake name by checking consumer databases for credit history tied to that name/address. Fake names stand out like sore thumbs when querying databases for historical identity data.
