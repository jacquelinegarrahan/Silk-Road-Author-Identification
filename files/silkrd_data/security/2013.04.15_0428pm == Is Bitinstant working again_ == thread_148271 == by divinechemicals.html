				I know that the last few days has apparently been really bad for Bitinstant. But I&#039;m trying to get some BTC today, so I&#039;m wondering if everything has gone back to normal at Bitinstant now that the price has seemingly stabilized at ~$95. Has anyone used Bitinstant in the last 24 hours or so? Is it back to normal?

				I&#039;m having an issue with bitcoin to email via coinapult. I emailed Charlie Shrem and he got back to me pretty quickly and forward my problem to Ira at coinapult, but I haven&#039;t heard a damn thing from Ira and I&#039;m starting to get really pissed. Hold off on any trasactions for a bit. Ill update if this gets resolved reasonably.

				I finally got my btc via coinapult. Bitinstant seems to be okay, but if there is a problem their customer service sucks unless you contact someone like the CEO directly. The customer service at coinapult however, is nonexistent. I would say its safe to use, but I will be looking for alternatives in the future.

				I just used Bit Instant less than an hours ago - this was my first time using it and I had zero problems. Took me about 20 minutes to drive home from CVS and all my money was in my Mt.Gox account and sent it all over to my SR account.<br /><br />

				Guys,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am glad for some of you that BI is &quot;working&quot; again.... just heed caution perhaps.&nbsp; I have read enough and know personally of a friend who has been &quot;help up&quot; weeks getting funds to be transferred.&nbsp; If you have a Bank of America, Wells Fargo, or Chase Bank...and some money of course... perhaps be vigilant and look at other methods as well&nbsp; :D

				I used Bitinstant today with no problems. I have actually never experienced any problems with their service, but the stories made me really skeptical and I stopped using it. However, since BitFloor is out, it was the quickest option. <br /><br />I always do a cash deposit and deposit directly to my main wallet. I got a confirmation email about 5 minutes after I did the Money Gram transfer, and by the time I got home the transfer had 4/6 confirmations already. Really fast and no problems.

				Just got back from a transaction with Bitinstant, first one since I started using Bitfloor. Their blog said they had all issues fixed so I figured I would give it a go, and it went way better than I expected. By the time I got home, my wallet was already counting confirmations. <br /><br />I would say Bitinstant is good to go for now, but I don&#039;t think I would risk any massive orders just yet.

				I never had a problem with BitInstant but the fees are fucking highway robbery.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try Bitcopia today.&nbsp; BitInstant will be a LAST resort as my money is too tight to pay all those fees

				You think Bitinstant&#039;s fees are highway robbery? Bitcopia (as of yesterday - today they are not trading because their bank account was closed) was charging almost $20 extra PER COIN. I&#039;ve never had to pay that much with any service. Ridiculous. Seems like Bitinstant is really the only option now.

				DO NOT USE BITINSTANT, at least if you need funds fast, seems it takes 1day to a month for some peoples money to clear, I am going on 48 hours waiting myself, first time i have ever had a problem and it will be the last time i ever use bitinstant, seems they have bitten off more then they can chew........

				I may try a small deposit with them in the coming days if I can&#039;t find a MP vendor. <br /><br />Can anyone recommend an MP --&gt; btc vendor that&#039;s still providing good service? If I can go that route, fuck bitinstant! I don&#039;t even care about losing a few bucks, I just want the damn coins fast so I can order already.
