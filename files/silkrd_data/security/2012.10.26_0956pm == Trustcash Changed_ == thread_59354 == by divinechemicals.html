				Okay, I&#039;m starting to panic a little bit. First Bitinstant was down, and now that it&#039;s back up, Trustcash is different. Trustcash is how you get money to Mt. Gox with a cash deposit that runs through Bitinstant. Well the whole site is changed now and I can&#039;t figure anything out. Any thoughts on how to work it?

				Alright I contacted Trustcash customer support (using a borrowed phone, don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m secure), and they said that right now it&#039;s just a technical difficulty connecting to Bitinstant. It should be fixed relatively soon. As long as everything is back to normal by Monday, I&#039;ll be happy. I guess I might need an account on Trustcash right now, but that&#039;s fine, it&#039;s not exactly difficult to use a fake e-mail address and name.

				Same here. I contacted customer support at TrustCash. They siad it seems to be a technical issue, and that they have had 100&#039;s of calls for the same thing. In other words. There is a glitch in their system that seems to keep the site from directing you to the &quot;select a deposit&quot; location. Although some people can access the deposit location, when they select a location, there is no option to continue with the transaction.<br />Right now, they say it is undetermined when the problem will be fixed, but they are working on it &quot;aggressively&quot;. I am sure they are, because everyone is losing money with the system down, especially TrustCash, I mean, that&#039;s their &quot;thing&quot;. Cash bank deposits.<br /><br />And it IS a problem with TrustCash. I have tried using Mt Gox, Blockchain, Bitinstant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Blockchain just says &quot;invalid transfer location&quot;.<br /><br />I hope they get it fixed soon, because I really need to place an order on SR. <br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I had the same problem and was panicky too because I needed to get an order in. I used Blue Sky Trader on SR. They are a vendor that allows for a cash deposit and sends your BCs directly to your SR account or another addy. Worked the same way a bitinstant-trustcash-BoA deposit would except that I had the funds on SR in under an hour. Was very satisfied. Hope this helps, good luck.

				Does anyone have any information on why Bitinstant no longer has the ability to send BTC directly to a BTC address or to an email?

				Cause it&#039;s an easy way to buy drugs in the mail anonymously, and they&#039;ve been getting some pressure to make it not quite as easy?
