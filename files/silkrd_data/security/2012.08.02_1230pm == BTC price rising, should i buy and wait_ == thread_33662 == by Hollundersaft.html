				hi,<br /><br />i guess everbody knows that the price of BTC is rising really fast.<br />should i buy now and wait for some time until the price is even higher and might have a better price at Silk Road.<br />or my guess, vendors would go up with there product prices anyway, so no gain in waiting?<br /><br />any suggestions here?<br /><br />thanks alot

				I don&#039;t know which way it&#039;s going to go. There could be a sudden drop or another major spike. Risks of trading man. I just went for it and bought some.

				hi,<br /><br />but for example BTC rises up to 12 $ an stays there, newly postet offers on Silk Road would be cheaper BTC than before. because the vendors know that some customers are not willing to buy for the double, right? or am i wrong?<br /><br />i buy in euros, yesterday it was around 7,5 and today 8,5. what do advise, wait and maybe buy it cheaper or buy now and wait for the new prices on Silk Road (if im right and they drop)?<br /><br />thanks

				sorry, forgot something.<br />its about the SR-prices. i mean shouldnt they be equal to the real world? who would buy 1 gramm of whatever for 26 $ if the streetprice anywhere in the western countries is about 13 $? of course its just an example, but it could rise that much as it looks right now.<br /><br />i really dont know how to handle my euros on mt.gox right now.....

				When they hit 11 then stated going back down i was sure it was time for a crash back to 7or8ish, so i sold almost all my BTC (i&nbsp; dont have much BTC anyway, every time i buy some to invest only... they still all end up one here).<br />With plans to buy them back awhen it settled after price drop.<br />But it stabalised at 10-10.5ish, soi have bought a bunch back at a only slightly lower price ( so no loss from exchange fees).<br />So still up, but waiting for something to happen, wondering if the big market manipulators are going to start rasisng them again, else they prolly go down a but i guess.<br />I got some bids and asks in that should hopefuly see me okay if i miss too much, cant sit watching bitcoin price all day.

				i still feel you should just stay out of the whole thing<br /><br />yeah you can make some money, but you can just as easily lose it all, since btc isn&#039;t that stable<br /><br />just enjoy the benefits of btc&#039;s anonymity and profit off of silk road, not btc.<br />i&#039;d only really hold on to my btc if I had nothing to spend them on, since you never know if the btc is gonna crash or not

				First off...<br /><br />If someone&#039;s product is 200 USD... and BTC is 10 USD.. then you&#039;re going to need 20 btc to get that item,<br />BUT if btc jumps to 20 USD.. you&#039;ll only need 10 btc to get that item.<br /><br />Products on SR flux with BtC.

Sometimes the sellers don&#039;t adjust everyday or every week. this is why its important to buy and finalize as soon as you get your stuff so everyone can trade in a weeks time. the BTC don&#039;t rise and fall that fast in a week so it makes trading worth it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				What i mean is who gives a flying fuck what the market does, its gonna rise then drop suddenly to its real value, whatever you believe that is. go ahead and spend your tiny savings on bitcoin and try to make some money back, chances are by the time you make anything transaction fees will negate the difference. we all know coins are worth less than 8 but these faggots who mine/buy a million coins and then try to jerk the market around with huge buys are trying to get yokels to follow the leader and then they&#039;ll do a huge sell and take all ur money. Fuck them, dont let them trick you into thinking its more than its worth.<br /><br />Dont follow my advice, look at the damn charts, some greedy asshole bought $2.5m worth of coins last night a jacked the price up half a point. Then a bunch of follower lemmings bought in a wave after that and jacked it up an additional point, so this guy has made $25k so far just by buying a shitton of coin, and when he goes to sell whats gonna happen? All those followers who came after are gonna get taken. These are the wallstreet fuckers who have been robbing the US since the 70&#039;s, they do the same shit all the time on the real markets.
