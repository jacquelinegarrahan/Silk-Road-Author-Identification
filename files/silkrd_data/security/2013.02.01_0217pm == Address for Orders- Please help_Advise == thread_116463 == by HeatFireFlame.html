				Hi all, So iv noticed loads of different security threads etc, and the one inconsistency that i have found is this, and il need some help with it. <br />(Everything would be sent PGP encrypted btw)&nbsp; Most guides say to always use your real address and name of someone who lives with you, Dont try and pull a fast one by misspelling your name or something,&nbsp; and the reason being that the post office might just realize that nobody lives at that address with the name on the package or your local postie who has been delivering your mail for ages realizes also&nbsp; that there&#039;s nobody there by that name or it&#039;s new etc and anyone of these things COULD not definitely but COULD get you caught. So hence always use your real name and address and if anything fucks up forget your PGP pass and deny all knowledge<br /><br />But recently i found a few guides that say NEVER use your real details, That it would be as stupid as using your real email address for SR. Always get them sent to a drop house or a friends, Well i dont have to many trustworthy friends to be honest so id like to avoid that,&nbsp; In my neighborhood there aint many empty houses either.<br />Anyway id like some input .What do you all think? <br />Thanks

				The way you work this is down to you. If you have a clean criminal record, and you know the home your in has not been raided or previously occupied by some naughty guy or girl, AND if you have nothing dodgy going on there, you can use your own home.<br /><br />A &#039;drop address&#039; can be anything from a neighbours house or a friends. Just make sure the home its being delivered to wis not occupiede by teenagers who open up the front door with a joint behind the ear and the smell of ganga hitting visitor as soon as the door opens!<br /><br />Find a friend who shares your love of whatever drug you order - cut them a deal. Its possible to order things for people and charge a small percentage.<br /><br />Never use a post box.<br /><br />A works address might be a good one as there is always someone who will just sign for any package. If you got a clean record and half an ounce of hash is discovered by Customs or the police, it will not be a big investigation. You may get a letter, sometimes asked to discuss an issue with a member of staff. If you ever get this - phone up and act the outraged citizen!<br /><br />As for your own name, some vendors do kind of demand that - because the post offices and courier firms are starting to go very high tech and its possible a quick scan might find disparity between the name and the address. But with thousands of people moving address each day, its not suspicious to find a letter addressed to someone other than the person who occupies the home. I know postal workers, they just post a letter whatever name it has on. My main interest is finding out more about the software being piloted, this would make it easy for customs and police and other agencies to trace things. A database of all mail sent might throw up flags if someone kept gettting mail from South America for example. It would be easy to have a database of all suspect homes and anyone with a criminal record for drugs. The scary thing is that the new technology could use an automated prcocess to send the letter./package through an x-ray machine, the new ones are automated - no more getting one past a sleepy customs or postal worker! <br /><br />Also, there are electronic sniffer machines, being piloted at airports and post offices. This could create a problem in a few years but people are busy trying to design better materials to stop odours escaping. Everything is pourous, and the only reason a dog might not sniff out weed in a sealed bottle (for example) is that it needs time for the smell to get through. <br /><br />So, to summarise, don&#039;t take this &#039;use your own name&#039; advice as Gospel, I know people who just make up different names for each buy - even better if you have previous tenants - but be war in case that previous tenant was not a &#039;player&#039; of sorts!<br /><br />But fear not using your own name if your address is clean and your not storing a few kilkos of dodginess!<br /><br />IF you ever got a knock off the cops regarding a package, deny ever sending for it - and be polite, answer all questions, do not get aggressive or evasive. Just act astounded that someone used your address to send hashish. Tell them its lucky they found it and you will ask neighbours if they have ever had any suspicious packages sent.<br /><br />If your sending off for class A drugs, expect to get a visit and possible warrant to search if your ordering 7 grams or more. Even an 8 ball might make some cop go fishing in case your up to something else.<br /><br />And vendors! Please delete our addresses as soon as possible! NEVER keep a list of addresses - I know some will, but the people I have dealt with here are professional - and if they are not I don&#039;t order again.<br /><br />As for a return address, this is needed with international mail - but for domestic UK it does not matter, even handwritten is cool and hardly raises flags for suspicion. What is a weak spot for some vendors is using the same packaging. Exceptiuons might be people who have real return addys and companies to get returns sent to. IF ever one person is busted, you can bet customs will photo the package and eventually software will simply pick out these packages.<br /><br />Enjoy these years, it might be the last ones of freedom regarding drugs. But have faith in the smugglers who have ALWAYS managed to find a way around the obstacles put there by the authorities.<br /><br />As for encryption, you might as well use it - SR is encrypted but if it was ever compromised, I&#039;m sure someone could get into the accounts and read messages. At that point anyone who just sends the addy by message with no encryption would be caught with their pants down. <br /><br />But encryption is only safe if your using a really good personal key. I&#039;d use 128 characters myself, sure its pain typing it in but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />So, order away my friend, everyone is wary with that first order. I remember mine, I paced the floors a bit! But now, its just like ordering off Amazon. I purchase something and 99% of the time it comes. Sometimes stock runs out - and we also have scammers here but we also have escrow so use it! That said, there are some vendors with 100% who take FE and at least if SR went down or got hacked - you&#039;d have paid so would get delivered your product of choice.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />And hope everyone has a good day out there!<br /><br />And if your going out tonight, enjoy!
