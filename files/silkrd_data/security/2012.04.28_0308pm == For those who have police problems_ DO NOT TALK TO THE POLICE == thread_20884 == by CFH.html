				Seriously, this is one of the first rules when dealing with the police - yet I see the question over and over again &quot;Police! What do I do?&quot;<br /><br />DO NOT TALK TO THE POLICE<br /><br />-Why?<br />&quot;Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law&quot;<br />Even if you think that you&#039;re giving a good story of how it wasn&#039;t you - don&#039;t talk to them - what if theirs a hole in your story? BAM it&#039;ll be used against you.<br /><br />-But I just wanna help the police so they won&#039;t go after me...<br />No no no and no. You won&#039;t get the police &quot;on your side&quot; their job is to convict, not to develop a personal relationship!<br /><br />-I just wanna give them ideas of who else it might be<br />NO! It will only raise suspicious and will be used against you! (notice a pattern?)<br /><br />-They&#039;ll think I&#039;m guilty!<br />Who cares? They already do or they wouldn&#039;t be talking to you - don&#039;t talk to them - give them no ammunition.<br /><br />So in review:<br />Do not. Ever. Talk to the police.<br /><br />Also a lawyer would be good if you can afford one! (Getting one doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re guilty - just smart! And he will advise you to *gasp* NOT talk to the police!)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />CFH

				Even hardened criminals usually talk to the police.&nbsp; It sounds like wonderful advice, but when you are frightened, and they are in your face, and you can&#039;t think straight, it&#039;s just about impossible not to talk to them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been down a lot of hard roads, and know that most people, in the pinch, when the shit really hits the fan, *do* talk to police.&nbsp; The idea is to be reasonably friendly, act surprised, and don&#039;t give out any info that can hurt you.&nbsp; Establish a good relationship with a *bondsman* before you need one, and if you know a criminal attorney, or know somebody who knows one, ask if you can buy an hour of their time, and have a consultation with them.<br /><br />But what sounds like good common sense, and solid information, on here, is usually well forgotten if shit hits the fan.&nbsp; If you *do* clam up, the cops figure that one, you are probably guilty of something or another, and two, you&#039;ve seen too many cop movies.<br /><br />Just have a good story ready, for whatever you think might come down the pike, for example, say &quot;Yeah, I&#039;ve had some of these homeless guys ask if I&#039;d mind getting their mail for them...&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;Fuck if I know anybody in Canada: somebody must be fucking with me, hell they didn&#039;t even get my name spelled right....I need to see a lawyer...&quot;&nbsp; etc...<br /><br />Even jailhouse lawyers know you&#039;re going to talk, in the clutch...just practice a little yoga, work on your breathing, be friendly, have your story ready.&nbsp; Jail isn&#039;t that bad, once you&#039;ve been there a few times, you realize you&#039;ll be alright.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t take any free zoo-zoos and wham-whams...and call your bondsman.

				Some good advice a friend gave me is to tell them a little bit of useless information they already know in order to hide a lot. This makes them feel like you are not hiding something, but at the same time you are not providing them with anything new.<br /><br />I had some pot hidden in my ass crack and it wreaked of good weed in the car, so the cop asked if we had been around weed that day, so knowing that it was&nbsp; blatant that the car smelled I said that I was at a friends house where a few people were smoking, and when asked about having any pot I denied that I did, and he didn&#039;t pursue further investigation, but if I would of denied being around weed, and smelled like it then it would be obvious that I was hiding something and trying to lie openly to his face.<br /><br />I always try to make small talk and shoot the shit about current events or about my job, because I have tried the silent and hard nosed not speaking at all, and it really just made things harder and made them harass me more since in their mind it surely meant I was guilty of something. Just never tell them anything unecessary that will be used against you, but if they have you on tape being at McDonald&#039;s and you know it talk about how you were dying for a McDouble

				&quot;I want an attorney present before I speak with any LE. I want an attorney now. I would like some water and something to eat in my cell while I wait for the attorney.&quot;

				Who gives a fuck if the cops think you are guilty or not they are not the jury, not to mention they already think everyone who isn&#039;t a cop is guilty of something and anything you say will be totally twisted by them&nbsp;

				Remember that if they didn&#039;t throw you on the ground and cuff you and are asking you questions then you have the advantage, and just need to stay cool and act concerned about the situation and confused, and they will have to go away when there is obviously nothing devious going on.<br /><br />If they ask about you expecting mail, just say nothing in particular, but I usually expect my newspaper and daily bill and junk mail. <br /><br />They will ask if you ordered anything recently and just tell them that nothing should be arriving or if you ordered legit goods that week tell them about them and how you&nbsp; received your shoes or whatever.<br /><br />They will eventually get to the point about there being drugs in the mail addressed to you or your house, and just tell them you have no idea about it and you don&#039;t use any drugs, and have no idea why someone would send that to your address. Maybe give them an idea that the neighbor kids are always getting in trouble and had something to do with it, but there isn&#039;t any reason that you know of that should be arriving.
