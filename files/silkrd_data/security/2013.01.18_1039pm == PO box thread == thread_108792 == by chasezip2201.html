				Hey, I&#039;ve been considering getting a PO box to handle some shipments.&nbsp; The one at my local town has one open.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if anyone has any experience with these or any general info.<br /><br />Would you consider it significantly safer or unsafe?<br />If something is shipped to my PO box does it have to have my name on it?&nbsp; Does it need a name at all?&nbsp; Will a fake name draw red flags?<br />How easy/hard is it too get one in a fake name?<br />You cant ship internationally to PO box right?&nbsp; Anyone know a good company to go through?<br />Do packages to a PO box draw any other extra suspicion?<br /><br />Can&#039;t think of anything else right now.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any responses.

				In some countries (USA/Canada are perfectly fine) Express envelopes from Canada are not accepted to PO boxes, because of signature at delivery.<br />You might have luck opening a PO box with fake school ID and fake birth certificate and fake utility bill and/or even better a fake rental agreement.<br />Go in with a story like, &quot;I want to open a box cuz I am renting a room in a house with other people and the mail box is shared and I&#039;ve had problems with people opening/taking my mail.

BEST thing to do..<br /><br />matter fact as a vender i would suggest you not telling buyers to do anything like this ever again.. <br />just my 2 cents
