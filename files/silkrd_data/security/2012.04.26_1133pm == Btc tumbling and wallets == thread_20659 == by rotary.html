				do you guys think I really need to tumble my coins? I use a btc wallet app on my phone which has two OS loaded onto it and I do all my purchasing through it, do you think this is a secure method as I can hide the phone/destroy and even if they get it they need to know&nbsp; how to access the second OS?<br /><br />Your thoughts please<br /><br />:)

				Doesn&#039;t matter where you do the transactions from, if you don&#039;t mix your coins you&#039;re as anonymous as the method used to buy them. So you should mix your coins if you&#039;re buying them in a way linkable to you, even if you&#039;re running bitcoind on a bomb shelter secure OS it&#039;s not gonna protect you.

				I read somewhere about software that I can download to my computer so that I can create and Ewallet on my computer so that I can transfer bit coins into this before sending them to SR but cant find it now. Does anyone know of this software I can download? This would be much appreciated. Thanks.

Mixers such as Bitcoinfog also strongly increase your anonymity for a small commission.<br /><br />The only truly secure method of buying Bitcoins is via cash - I actually offer this service in the UK/Europe so you probably think I would say this but I am sure there are sellers who will do the same in the USA - maybe have a look at your local Craiglist?<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Thanks Impaler, I appreciate the advice. I just wanted to create some ewallets so I could put the money thru different wallets and increase the security rather than just straight into SR so there wasnt such a direct track from me to SR. I think I am going to have to try giving the bit coin fog system a try, it seems the simplest and most effective way without having to go thru long complicated procedures. Not being computer literate makes what would be taxing tasks into absolute nightmares.<br /><br />Thanks a lot tho much appreciated.
