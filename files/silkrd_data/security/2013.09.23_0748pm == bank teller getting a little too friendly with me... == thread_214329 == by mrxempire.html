				I usually go to my local bank of america about once a month to fill out an out of state deposit slip in order to obtain bitcoins. When I went in today, the teller who had served me the previous two times was getting a little friendly and asking me a few questions about my deposits. &quot;oh, hello! I remember you! You come in about once a month right?&quot;. &quot;are you making these deposits for your work, or for yourself?&quot; &quot; Do you have a bank account with us?&quot; &quot;See you next month then!&quot; She didn&#039;t seem very suspicious of me at all, but her questions did get me a little nervous, as I don&#039;t have an elaborate backstory as to why I&#039;m filling out out of state deposit slips to different companies in different states every month. The only thing i could think to say was &quot;i&#039;m paying a bill&quot;. Does anyone have an alibi I could use as to why i&#039;m making these deposits every month, or should i go to a different BOA next time?

				This was not BTC related but once a bank person asked me from whom the transaction was made when I asked why it is still not credited in my account even tough before I said it was an internal transaction she wanted to know, I just repeated it and she understood that this is none of her business. I&#039;m not sure if she can see it anyway, I guess not, that would also explain why she asked in the first place. Well, after thinking about it I&#039;m pretty sure she can see it when entering my account number.

				I never frequent the same Bank of America.&nbsp; I too make deposits to acquire bitcoins and I usually try to switch it up every time. Sure, I&#039;ll go back to the same B of A... but not twice in a row. It&#039;s always staggered so I don&#039;t became a familiar face. <br /><br />This is really bad practice on your part OP. I am aware that BitCoins are legal, but it raises suspicion with LE I&#039;m sure...&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve recently gone to 2 different bank of america&#039;s in the past month. I plan on going to a 3rd one when and if I do... I&#039;ve got my own bitcoin provider that doesn&#039;t require me to do this, but sometimes I have to with others. <br /><br />Keep it fresh. <br /><br />Also, I agree, you should give her the D.

				I have always been upfront about investing in Bitcoins and how it is the mathematical representation of gold. Bitcoins are not illegal, there are many uses besides illicit drug purchases. Things are only as shady as you make them.

				Well, if the teller is a female just go flirting. You will either get her in a position that she will forget about questioning or even better fix yourself a date.<br /><br />Once they asked me also why I am doing such deposits and I just answered &quot;I am making profit and I am using your bank so you have also a percentage on my profit. If you don&#039;t like that deal I can find somewhere else to go.&nbsp; Unfortunately there are plenty of banks around.&quot;<br /><br />He just stopped questioning, smiled and wished me a good day. :)

				Obvious play is to try to ask her out to dinner next time, if that fails, go to another BOA and hit on that girl.&nbsp; Keep changing up BOAs until you can bang one of the counter girls.&nbsp; Good luck.

But even if they didn&#039;t, and if I knew what a paranoid individual would do, I would say that the paranoid individual would not even allow the thought of walking into a bank for the purpose of buying btc to cross her mind. She would act in a more covert fashion when purchasing her digital currencies. <br /><br />There are several reasons for this any rookie can list off in his mind.

				Like others have said in this thread those are &quot;qualifying questions&quot;. She&#039;s trying to figure out if there&#039;s a service she can recommend and get you signed up. Just a simple sales tactic, probably forced by her employer. <br /><br />I really like the &#039;going super christian on her ass&#039; idea.

				Tellers are not the most knowledgeable people in the world. I used to work as a bank teller at the age of 16 for Chase bank and then bounced around from bank to bank for around 8 years and have met a lot of people and 99% of them I could say &quot;Hey this is a deposit to buy bitcoins so I can do some offshore/overseas gambling&quot;.....and they would have no idea what your talking about. Most bank tellers dont get paid enough to give a shit about any shady shit you may be doing.<br /><br />Go in there say your making a deposit for your friend, hows your day and that it. They may go on asking if you bank with them (its there main goal to open checking account at any bank they are glorified salesmen) and to shut them down say &quot;no saldy I cant open up a bank account because I&#039;m in &quot;Check Systems&quot; and my last checking account got closed out on me for overdraft. <br /><br />*Check systems is the nation wide deposit account monitoring system so lets say you over draft your account at chase and never pay it back you cant run to bank of America&nbsp; and open an account there until you clear up the over drawn account etc.<br /><br />Its simple if you think they are being chatty its because they are bored or they are trying to figure out a way to sell you on opening checking, savings, investment account etc. <br /><br />In all the years I have worked at banks either as a teller, auditor, fraud prevention etc never have we been briefed on bitcoins. its all money laundry, check kiting, and check fraud. The last thing they bat an eye at is a guy depositing 1000 bucks cash a week. they just make sure the bills are not counterfeit and go one there way.<br /><br /><br />The only exception to this rule is when you get the real old women that has been working for that bank for 20 years, know her life has passed her by and being a righteous bank teller is al they have left to live for. They can give you some shit sometimes.

I used to work as a bank teller at the age of 16 for Chase bank and then bounced around from bank to bank for around 8 years and have met a lot of people and 99% of them I could say &quot;Hey this is a deposit to buy bitcoins so I can do some offshore/overseas gambling&quot;.....and they would have no idea what your talking about. Most bank tellers dont get paid enough to give a shit about any shady shit you may be doing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Excellent point.&nbsp; You always have to consider that when dealing with the face-to-face people at a bank.&nbsp; Tellers are not who you need to be worried about at all.<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s a little off topic, but @godness420 +1 for the Loaded Lux quote.
