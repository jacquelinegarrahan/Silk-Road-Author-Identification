				Dear SR community,<br /><br />first of all I&#039;d like to say that I really appreciate the existence of SR and all of you guys who contribute to this special community, you&#039;re great.<br /><br />I know that I&#039;m new here and I&#039;ll take all the necessary time I need to read through basic topics like PGP etc. and try to contribute to SR.<br /><br />Well, as we all know Bitcoin is a great currency, I don&#039;t think that SR would be possible without it.<br />While reading some posts (here and on other boards), it came to my knowledge that a lot people payout their Bitcoin to their bank account or use other ways where they have to identify theirselves.<br /><br />Thinking of security this could end in a very dangerous situation for some people, in addition to that recieving vast sums could cause suspicion by your bank.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about some possible ways of payout:<br /><br />1. Sending money by priority shipment (EU wide) to your country, sending drugs could be a pain in the ass, but money? Should be more relaxed.<br /><br />2. If you don&#039;t mind travelling, you (or your runner) could pick it up or have it delivered by courier to the hostel / hotel you / your runner stay/s.<br /><br />In my opinion this could be a very good option instead of using banks to recieve money, I&#039;d never ask where you&#039;ve got your money from, simply because it&#039;s none of my business.<br /><br />&quot;deposit&quot; would be more like a longterm payout, e.g. you deposit your BTC in October, but due to whatever reasons you / your runner can&#039;t pick it up before [insert random month], you would just need to tell me till when I have to payout your money and whether it should be picked up / delivered.<br /><br />How would I accomplish an anomyous payout:<br /><br />Fortunately I&#039;m in a country where it is no problem to find someone who&#039;d like to buy Bitcoin, even larger sums, without asking questions.<br />There are no fixed rates for buying / selling thanks to Bitcoin&#039;s nature, so every payout rate would be individualized.<br />I would see it as my job to keep the fees as low as possible, for example:<br /><br />You want to payout 1000 Bitcoin, I&#039;d charge 25%.<br />The current worth of 1 Bitcoin is according to Mt. Gox about 8.8 € / Bitcoin -&gt; 8.8 € * 750 = 6600 €.<br />I&#039;d get 2200 € (8.8 € * 250 = 2200 €).<br />Let&#039;s say someone would like to buy your 750 Bitcoin at a&nbsp; lower rate, for example: (8.3 € * 750 = 6225 €).<br />By individualized I mean that now I&#039;d give you for instance 200 € out of my share, to keep the payout rate &quot;balanced&quot; / fair.<br />And to be honest, it wouldn&#039;t bother me as long as we both get what we want.<br /><br />1000 Bitcoin is just a sample calculation,though it would be the min. amount.<br /><br />Of course keep in mind that a payout of 1000+ Bitcoin would take some time (max. two weeks, due to finding the best rate).<br /><br />Here comes the part where some guys might say that I&#039;m a ripper:<br /><br />I&#039;m new here, I know that and no one knows me and I&#039;m desperately searching for someone who&#039;d help me to establish this kind of service.<br />Escrow could be difficult at the beginning, but I&#039;ve thought about an option, for example:<br /><br />You&#039;d like to payout 1000+ Bitcoin, due to the fact that I&#039;m new you&#039;d probably use escrow, which I totally understand.<br />At the beginning the only possibility I see is, that you&#039;d use my service by escrow with a SR trustee, after recieving the Bitcoin he tells me that everything&#039;s fine, so I&#039;d start searching for the best rate. After finding the best suited rate the SR trustee would have to send the Bitcoin to the other trustee so that my runner can pick up your money, now it would be up to you how you want to recieve your money: delivered or picked up?<br /><br />For those of you who&#039;d like to help me establishing my service here on SR, to show my deep gratitude I&#039;d charge only 12.5% for the first 10 payouts.<br /><br />THIS IS CURRENTLY NOT AN OFFER (I DO NOT DO ANY PAYOUTS)!<br /><br />It&#039;s just a survey and a thread to post your opinion. Guys, I really want to know, what you think of this maybe soon-to-be service.<br />I appreciate every advice, interest etc.!<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid my English is a bit rusty, I&#039;m sorry for that.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for reading this, it&#039;s really appreciated!<br /><br />Kind reagards.<br /><br />Deutsche Bank

				25 percent?? <br /><br />seriously? i dont understand how your service could possibly be worth that much or require such fees<br />(thats nearly 3,000 dollars for a single transaction) <br /><br />i am positive no one will be interested <br /><br />try 2.5 percent MAYBE which is still a crazy 300 dollars imo

				There are some who might take you up on that rate, but it is very high.<br /><br />Also your description of &quot;easily&quot; finding someone willing to take bitcoins does not ring true to me.<br /><br />Shopping for rate is another weird aspect.<br /><br />How about you figure out how to open anonymous bank accounts and sell that service? I am a buyer for that.<br /><br />Modzi

				Anonymity has its price.<br /><br />Compared to other guys (e.g. on fraud boards) who offer anonymous LR (or other currencies) $ / € -&gt; $ / € payout, I&#039;d say that my rate is really fair. Some of them charge up to 40%, which in my opinion totally is a rip off.<br /><br />You have to keep in mind, that I&#039;m not a bank who&#039;d probably start asking questions.<br /><br />I don&#039;t need to figure out how to open anonymous bank accounts. You can easily buy them online.<br />They cost about 1000 €, but no one can guarentee you how long they&#039;d last.<br />Worst case scenario, you buy one, your seller fucks you up and closes your account, simply by giving the bank a hint.<br />Or he sells you his own one and reports it stolen or closes it, your 1000 € would be lost.<br /><br />This kind of stuff happens all the time on some fraud boards, everyone is trying to rip off the other one.<br /><br />And by the way, opening an anonymous bank account is in most countries a criminal act, because you need to fake IDs etc.<br />Sure, you could buy one, but that would still be a criminal act.<br /><br />Well, I don&#039;t know where you guys live, but here it&#039;s easy to find someone who&#039;d like to buy Bitcoin.<br /><br />I won&#039;t get 25%, because from my cut I&#039;d &quot;balance&quot; the payout as mentioned above and I&#039;d pay all the shipment fees etc.<br />Let&#039;s say I&#039;d get something between 18% - 22%.

I know that we&#039;re a bunch of paranoid people.<br />So, for me it&#039;s okay if the &quot;client&quot; would like to recieve his money by priority cash mail, but for those who don&#039;t trust the postman I wouldn&#039;t have the problem to arrange a delivery or a pick up on &quot;neutral&quot; ground. It&#039;s all about choices.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to build up this service from scratch, the first few &quot;trades&quot; could take some &quot;time&quot;, maybe a few days.<br />If I&#039;d try to sell 1000 Bitcoin for 5000 €, I&#039;m sure I&#039;d find a person within a few minutes, but that is not my goal.<br />I want the &quot;best&quot; or fairest rate possible, so both the &quot;client&quot; and I benefit from it.<br /><br />I&#039;m very confident that after the first few transactions when I have my &quot;own&quot; money, when I&#039;ve chosen some people who could pay out very fast everything could be brought up to speed.<br /><br />I wrote max. two weeks, that doesn&#039;t mean it has to be up to two weeks.<br /><br />I had to write it this way, because I&#039;m new here, I want to offer security for both parties, therefore escrow is the way to go.<br />But as written in the first post, at the beginning I&#039;d have to have a SR trustee send the Bitcoin to a trustee (&quot;double&quot; escrow) where I find the people who&#039;d buy Bitcoin, but only the first 2 - 5 times, so that could slower the whole process, but this way the SR trustee can see that I&#039;m legit.<br /><br />I understand your point, I&#039;d never force a potential client to choose between the options, I only see it as my job to offer more ways of recieving money.<br /><br />I&#039;d really like to proof myself here on SR and therefore I&#039;d be very grateful about every chance.

				so basically you&#039;re wanting to become a currency exchanger, whcih is completely legal and easy to do (provided u got the capital) and mail cash (which other exchangers do as well for much less).<br /><br />U know the fault with your plan is that your wanting to go through SR, and like other exchangers on here u are creating a correlation for your clients that could prove disastourous, much more than them washing their coins and depositing them. AAfter the last asshole on here ran off with everyones coins people are not likely to trust anyone with their cash. if u really want to do this run operations in the clearnet and dont associate your business (offically) on here.

				So... I&#039;m only commenting here because you came to a thread I had posted in and asked me to take part. I&#039;ve been part of other such &#039;cashout&#039; threads and, lets just say, haven&#039;t exactly been the popular one there. My current system for cashout is around 9%.... and it is anonymous. 25%? You buggin&#039;. Sure... some fools (like most, unfortunately, who post here) will take your offer, but if you can&#039;t beat 9%... I&#039;m staying right where I am. That said, you can find where I&#039;ve said that 20% is a fair rate for such a service. Objectively I believe this to be true<br /><br />Our crew is partying tonight so I&#039;m a little drunk... I&#039;m not trying to attack your methods or anyone else&#039;s quest for knowledge, but people need to understand that being a vendor has many complications that require some serious thinking. Based on the threads and replies I&#039;m very concerned for the majority of people &#039;wanting to be vendors&#039; blah blah. Never once did we (Aidoneus team) come to the forum begging for advice or information on how to do anything... being successful takes business savvy, common sense, and creative problem solving... I&#039;m sorry, but most people just don&#039;t obtain the skills/intelligence necessary. <br /><br />If you could provide a reliable cashout service (not money laundering, just cash in the mail) for under 10%... I promise you would have a fuckton of business. How you would manage that on your end is anyone&#039;s guess, I only state facts. :)<br /><br />Good luck, though. I wish everyone could be successful. But that isn&#039;t real life.<br />.Hades.<br />

				It is quite good. Though I do wish there were some actually threads that gave information about how other vendors do it. Specifically bulk vendors like dutch, ST, oldamsterdam, afterhour, etc... I&#039;m not butthurt about it, it would just be interesting to share the information.<br /><br />I wonder what goodies are in the Sr. Vendor section of the forum. We&#039;ll bet here soon enough to find out 8).<br />.Hades.

				Sober now. I hope my previous post didn&#039;t offend anyone... you know, filters come off and all that. Haha...<br /><br />I don&#039;t want you to get me wrong. As I mentioned in my original post, I believe 25% to be a fair rate overall. My comment was stemming from other threads on the &#039;cash out&#039; topic where people seem to think they can just magically pull money out without incurring fees. Said individuals aren&#039;t being realistic and haven&#039;t thought things through beyond &#039;oh I&#039;m gonna be rich by selling shit online&#039;.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you would get some customers at 25%. If this is a service you are truly interested in offering, perhaps you could start there to get rolling and then adjust accordingly as you&#039;re more capable of filling orders at a lower percentage. There is definitely demand for a reliable cashout service around this forum... the question is simply building your reputation and getting the first couple people to take the dive.&nbsp; :o<br />.Hades.<br /><br />

At the beginning that&#039;s the only way I could accomplish a trade, by using &quot;double&quot; escrow.<br /><br />By the way, another good reasons for charging 25%:<br /><br />1. I can &quot;balance&quot; the rates (for details check out first post in this thread)<br /><br />2. I pay all priority shipping fees<br /><br />If I&#039;d charge less, I couldn&#039;t do that without extra charging for additional fees etc.

				Nice thread - although I don&#039;t think all options have been discussed fairly.<br /><br />I am a big fan through the means of statistics and mathematics that with sufficient &#039;washing&#039; of your coins through multiple vessels you should be able to withdraw your coins to your bank account without issue – I do not think a bank is likely to start asking questions providing you&#039;re a &#039;professional&#039; individual seeking to conduct transactions with a bank account.<br /><br />If you&#039;re wanting cash in your hands, there are multiple &#039;exchange&#039; services out there that have been long known and are most definitely legit.&nbsp; You could simply wash/launder your coins as previously stated and either sell them to an exchange directly or convert to Liberty Reserve, Webmoney or the like and then sell to an exchanger.&nbsp; <br /><br />You could simply have the exchanger send you the money via Western Union or any other similar service.&nbsp; For transactions under $1000 USD I am confident you require no ID to pick up.&nbsp; You could use multiple names at different locations and the chances of this ever hitting your ass are slim in my opinion.&nbsp; With a bit of work you could take it a lot further.<br /><br />I think perhaps the greatest concern would be IF (and that&#039;s a big &#039;if&#039;) anyone were to pursue where the money had been coming from. A legit &#039;online&#039; business may need to be used as a front to answer any enquires however I simply do not see that to be a likely event.<br /><br />If one is willing to put in some time, there is no need for such a service however I appreciate everyone is looking to make some money.<br /><br />That&#039;s all she wrote.<br />&nbsp;
