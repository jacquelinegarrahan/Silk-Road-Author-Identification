				I&#039;m aware that Mtgox is now requiring you upload pictures of your ID to purchase BTC, but can I still use Bitinstant to get money sent to other exchanges like btc-e? I&#039;m just wondering how you guys are going to go about this from now on...

				You can use bit instant and select bitcoin address instead of mtgox, and it will deposit bitcoins straight to your SR wallet.

				The main reason people use MtGox instead of direct to bitcoin address is because the price that BitInstant quotes at the time isn&#039;t always the most recent or the best deal. When you have funds in your Gox account you can generally buy lower or negotiate a better deal with sellers. I&#039;ve lost as much as $8 on a $100 direct order due to inaccurate quoting from BI.

				I just went on to the bitinstant website to deposit some money and in the &quot;pay from&quot; it doesnt have the option of depositing cash at a local deposit moneygram place. In the &quot;pay from&quot; section the on;y options it gives me is VouchX coupon, BTC-E Coupon, Bitstamp Coupon, MT GOX, or Dwolla. Is anybody else having this problem?<br />How else can i get bitcoins in the USA? I really need them today..

				yea i checked localbitcoins, all of the ones who are wihtin 30 miles from me only take paypal and have zero feedback and charge outrageous market prices for a bitcoin (124 per bitcoin while the mt gox avg is at 109). I found one guy who charges 116 a coin but he lives 35 to 40 miles away and says he&#039;d prefer to use paypal unless it was for a just a coin or up to $200.<br />Yea I think I&#039;lll stick with moneypaks
