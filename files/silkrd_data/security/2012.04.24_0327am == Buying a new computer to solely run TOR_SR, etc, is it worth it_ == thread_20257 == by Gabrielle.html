				Since downloading TOR and joining SR, I&#039;ve become increasingly aware that the security measures I was (or wasn&#039;t) taking were woefully inadequate. At the moment I have a vague plan to (among other things) buy a separate computer solely for the purpose of TOR/SR and other related things. Is it worth it? And if so, would anyone be able to recommend what type of computer would be suitable? I was thinking a netbook or something similar.

				Just run Windows or Linux on a virtual machine and store it on a cheapo flash drive.<br /><br />...like the rest of us do.

				It&#039;ll take you a while to figure out, but it&#039;s actually very simple.<br />I know you can buy pre-made USBs/CDs here that have already been set-up, but honestly that&#039;s such a waste of money, you can literally make your own in less than an hour.<br /><br />If you were to buy one, you just turn on your PC, as it starts up (the first white text area you see) press ummm (It&#039;s like, F2 or F8 or F12.. I forget, I haven&#039;t done it in about a year) it&#039;s different for each PC.<br />And you set it to boot from either the USB/CD/HDD depending if you have a bootable USB/CD (HDD is normal boot).<br />Some PC&#039;s don&#039;t have a USB boot option, so you&#039;ll have to make a bootable CD.<br /><br />And say you had a bootable CD, you set the PC to boot from CD, so it&#039;ll start up an operating system from the CD, this means the hard drive isn&#039;t used and no data is stored.<br /><br />Making the USB/CD might take a bit of reading, but it&#039;s very easy really.<br />I think making a bootable USB is easier, as you just download a program or 2, format the USB to a certain &quot;type&quot; of USB that can be booted off of, and then move all of the operating system over.<br /><br />Operating systems are the programs which run all of the other programs, like windows.<br />Windows is just a program which can run other programs, like TOR and firefox.<br /><br />There&#039;s different types of O.S (operating systems) like Linux, which can be very confusing on the first try.<br />Though once you get the hang of it it&#039;s so easy.<br /><br />Holy moley stimulants, I&#039;m out of here.<br /><br />edit: oh yeah, to answer your question it&#039;s not worth buying a new pc.<br />Unless your current PC is a shithole, you&#039;ll probably notice your PC will run MUCH faster when it&#039;s booted from a USB as no other programs are running. Though this also depends on a lot of other factors.<br />Setting up your internet might be a bit tricky, as I remember it was for me.<br /><br />Wow I&#039;m just confusing myself, maybe this post might be the slightest bit helpful...<br /><br />

				Oracle has a very awesome, very free program called VirtualBox. That, a USB flash drive, and an ISO of the OS you want to run-- you&#039;re in business. And then you can smash it when you&#039;re on meth and think the cops are outside. Buy a bunch of them, they&#039;re like $10 a pop, and don&#039;t worry about losing them.. especially if you need to flush the damned thing in a fucking hurry.

				hey im new too still figuring everything out.&nbsp; &nbsp;but basically you can run a linux distro off of a portable USB stick or even micro SD, with the right security measures you can use it on your everyday computer without leaving&nbsp; a trace. it will be easier to conceal/flush/destroy if raided<br /><br />two of the commonly used stealth linux distros here are liberte and tails, just google a tutorial on how to install it to a bootable usb, it&#039;s fairly simple
