				Once I launch Tor it automatically brings up the Aurora Browser which I then use to connect to SR.&nbsp; (edited:&nbsp; I am using a mac computer)<br /><br />My question is this.&nbsp; Can I safely open up my regular web browser while I am logged into SR and browse normally with my regular web browser?&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I go to my regular sites, check my email, log into my bank, etc with my normal browser while the Aurora Browser is open?&nbsp; Of course I am not revealing any personal information in the Aurora Browser but does having another web browser open allow any bleed over of information?<br /><br />I have been assuming (I know I shouldn&#039;t have just assumed this), but I assumed that the 2 browsers are separate and distinct and that as long as I don&#039;t reveal any personal information in the Tor browser (Aurora) that I can surf the web as I normally would in my normal browser.<br /><br />By the way, I would prefer not to have answers that are speculation.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t just say that I should only use TOR exclusively if you are just guessing.&nbsp; I know that we should always err&nbsp; on the side of caution but I would like a legitimate answer that is based on fact and not fear.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for answering this question.

				you do use the latest tor browser bundle v2.2.35-7.1 - do you?&nbsp; ::) i don&#039;t have &quot;aurora&quot; here as browser, it&#039;s mozilla firefox v10.0.2!<br />maybe, you did something wrong when you updated your tor browser? i do always delete all previous files and reinstall the new tor browser bundle with the setup .exe... - you should do that as well?

				Late versions of Tor Bundle comes with Aurora, which is actually a modified version of Firefox and whose biggest advantage is that sometimes if you run the old bundles with Firefox and try to start Firefox (non-Tor) you get a message that Firefox is already running, as it relies in the windows and jobs&#039; names.<br /><br />To the OT, yes you can, both browsers works separately.

				Thanks for answering the question Da Man<br /><br />So the final answer is that I can run TOR aurora and log onto silkroad and also have another browser running (like safari) and browse normally and not worry.<br /><br />Thanks
