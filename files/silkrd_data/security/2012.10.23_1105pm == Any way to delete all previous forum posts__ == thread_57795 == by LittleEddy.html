				I screwed up and was using the same name as my SR user name. I have maybe 50-60 posts across multiple forums that I&#039;d like to see disappear. Is there any way globally to delete them or am I doomed so to speak. I&#039;ve been around for many months now and haven&#039;t realized until now that I was making a big mistake. I consider this to be a security leak unless I&#039;m mistaken. You live and learn everyday I guess...

				I can not help you with that,&nbsp; &nbsp;sorry. <br />Do you mind explaining why this is risky? Or maybe you could refer me to another thread?<br />Thanks.

				you can click on your profile summary, then &quot;show posts&quot;<br /><br />go through and remove each one by right clicking and opening a new tab. only posts you cant delete are the first ones in a thread that have been responded to<br /><br />i have to do if for a couple hundred spam threads a day, you can handle four pages. <br /><br />and its just a good idea for an extra measure of security if your SR acct and forum acct have different user names

There are a number of reasons one being the most obvious, it connects you with the SR web and whatever you might be saying on the forums.&nbsp; Sometimes also you like to talk about a vendor that you have done business with and wish not divulge your name to them. These are just a couple of things that comes to mind.

				After laboriously removing 60 or so posts, I made some observations. The first thing I noticed that each post taken by itself is not a big deal, but all the posts taken together are rather incriminating to say the least. A lot of posts can make a story about you. I didn&#039;t realize this until I had seen them again.<br /><br />On the technical side, when you go to profile/summary/show posts, your posts are listed, but you must go to each thread to individually remove them. Only a couple that were listed gives you the option to remove it on the summary page (why??) so it takes awhile to get them deleted.<br /><br />One big problem that you have no control over (that I&#039;m aware of) is that there are many times where your post is quoted in somebody&#039;s elses post (and there it sits.)<br /><br />Another problem, is with posts that you originate. You can&#039;t remove them--you can only modify them--i.e., remove all text, and change the subject line.<br /><br />I wondering what happens when you delete the account?? Does it change anything other than just doing the obvious? Any advantage in deleting it??<br /><br />One last thing, if you are as paranoid as I am about these kind of things and if you share the same sn&#039;s, you might consider doing this as well. If not, just don&#039;t post anything that is self incriminating. I know this is not the clearnet, but....

				No, this is not the clearweb, but anything you post here is visible for the entire world, just as if it were the clearweb. The only difference is that your posts here can&#039;t be traced back to your IP address. However if you give away sensitive information about yourself, you can give your identity away. It&#039;s good to realize that, and be a little careful about what you post here.

				Guys, LE are scanning with programs that capture every single edit and every single post update/removal. You cannot escape page scraping. This is a public place! <br /><br />You should just be careful about what you say, and perhaps decide on a identity policy (the lack thereof). Further to this, you should drop lots of believable red herrings to cover your tracks.

The red flag was then raised for me. And apart from this fu, I&#039;m pretty security conscious using pgp, etc. So yes, please post it somewhere so the newbies will see it and not repeat the same stupid mistake. Perhaps a reminder in the register for a new account would be a perfect place.
