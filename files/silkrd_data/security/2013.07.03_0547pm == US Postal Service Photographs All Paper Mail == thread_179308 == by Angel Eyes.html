				I&#039;m not sure if anyone else has posted this story from the NY Times, but its pretty relevant to anyone who sends paper mail (at the least).&nbsp; Check it out, I&#039;d love to hear thoughts from anyone who already knew about this or has any additional info.<br /><br />http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/monitoring-of-snail-mail.html?from=global.home

				Yeah, also posted in Shipping forums http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179287.0<br /><br />I wonder how we can avoid massive SR surveillance when DEA and local police have unfettered access to all mail &quot;metadata&quot; and are probably doing data mining on it at this very minute.

				Have seen it mentioned in a couple other threads. It&#039;s interesting to know anyway. Probably makes it even more compelling to be careful using fake names/addresses, because, at least with printed labels, you know they&#039;re automatically doing OCR on that and storing it in a searchable database. Any new name suddenly appearing that doesn&#039;t cross reference to known persons might bring up a flag? I don&#039;t know just brainstorming.

				I guess the one good thing about photographing 160 billion pieces of mail is that they have 160 billion photographs. Like the NSA, they are swimming in an ocean of data that they can&#039;t look at. No human eyes will look at the photos of your packages unless you come up in an investigation, like that woman in Texas who sent ricin in the mail. Even though she used a fake return address, they found her by looking at the cities of the return addresses of other pieces of mail that went through the system immediately before and after her letters, which turned out to be useful in that case.<br />

				Being that LE does not even need a subpoena to obtain mail covers (all they need to do is request them), this is a SERIOUS threat to all contraband vendors. Mail covers have been around forever, but now it&#039;s known that LE can request RETROACTIVE mail covers... shiiiit. I&#039;d be worried...

				And my first thought was, &quot;No damn wonder they are so far in the red&quot;. <br /><br />How much money are they being forced to spend to take and store pictures of everything. <br /><br /><br />Then I thought they just need to order themselves one item from here, then cross check the return address and get all the other addresses that received packages from there. <br /><br />Fuck.

				It&#039;s all about priorities and resources my friends... a small and powerless group of geeks who take drugs will never compete with terrorism; where the worst case scenario is a nuclear bomb killing us all. The bulk of resources will always go to that, and the other 1000s of things on a higher priority than SR right now.<br /><br />Some of you are killing yourselves with stress, and most of you are just personal buyers.

There is a high chance that this system resulted in multiple interceptions in the past, if a vendor ships out ten big packages at once and then one of them is intercepted, guess which packages are going to be scrutinized most heavily? The ten sent immediately before and after the one that was intercepted. I have noticed that bulk interceptions tend to happen in clusters, if one person has 1 kg of MDMA intercepted then all of the people sent MDMA in that shipping period have their orders intercepted as well. I have seen the same thing happen with bulk crystal LSD and other things. I would bet that it went something like this:<br /><br />A. Vendor sends 10 people bulk orders at the same time<br />B. Dumbfuck customer checks his packages tracking with Tor which flags it<br />C. Customs discovers it is loaded with bulk amounts of drugs<br />D. Customs queries for all packages sent immediately before and after the intercepted package<br />E. Customs intercepts 10 packages that are now flagged<br /><br />I am almost positive scenarios like this have unfolded before.

				I recall plenty of private forum vendors refusing to hand out tracking information because customers are so stupid they hang themselves by bombarding USPS websites with multiple Tor connections constantly checking their package status (do to being drug fiends lol)<br /><br />As for Canada, Can post photographs all parcels/express post and other courier items.

				There isn&#039;t much of a debate about checking tracking with Tor. Even if we stupidly assume that they do not monitor for this, it only takes a basic level of tech education to realize how trivial it would be for them to check for this and flag all packages checked with Tor. Packages checked with Tor almost certainly contain contraband, and given how trivial it is to detect packages which have tracking checked with Tor, it is obviously a trivial system that would result in a high success rate.

				But how much priority and express mail goes through the US each week? You would have to flag a package (priority or express) that is probably out of any major sorting facilities in 48 hours and en route to rural areas. <br /><br />So you specifically target and intercept one or two packages and do what with them exactly? <br /><br />Open them? <br /><br />Where&#039;s the warrant?<br /><br />Unless your return address is flagged (from LE knowing the return address) I don&#039;t see the grounds for a lost or opened package via a warrant if the package is simply linked to being tracked with TOR. Logistically it makes no sense. If you have a dick fuck ton of orders going out and whatnot then yeah, probably not good to use TOR via USPS. <br /><br />But who actually does that? You can check tracking via a third party with TOR, so now we&#039;re discussing tradecraft and semantics instead of TOR tracking flagging packages. <br /><br />What about a vendor who sends one or two orders every few days and checks them 48-72 hours or even later via TOR? <br /><br /><br />
