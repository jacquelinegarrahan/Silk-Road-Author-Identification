The general rule of thumb is that you will have access to and can spend your Bitcoins after the transactions has been confirmed 6 times, this is done to prevent double spending of coins and other issues, this is a real basic explanation of it. Oh and I&#039;m not putting it in basic terms because of you, I&#039;m doing because of me, lol.<br /><br />Basically it usually takes on a normal no issues going on day around an hour for coins to become available after they have been sent, so basically 10 minutes a confirmation, but I have had it take as little as 25 minutes and as long as 5 hours, but around an hour seems to be the norm.

Had my BTC in SR in under 2 hours.<br /><br />If you want other ways you could try Blue Sky Trading, as he allows cash payment at Bank of America, depending on your location this may or may not be an option for you. The only thing is you will have to plan ahead with BST as they have a queue that can be a few days.
