				I posted this but got no answers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve encrypted my system partition but it doesn&#039;t seem my entire HD is encrypted. <br /><br />For example, TC tells me my system partition is 231 GB. However, my D drive is 345 GB. How do I remedy this situation?<br /><br />Also:<br /><br />---If I encrypt my HD, and then someone uses my hard drive while it&#039;s decrypted, could that person gain the Truecrypt password necessary to decrypt my HD?<br />---If I encrypt a USB drive and then use it on another computer not infected with any malware, could the person still discern the USB password after I&#039;ve removed the USB drive simply by analyzing data on the computer?<br />---How could one know about a hidden volume?<br />---Why does Truecrypt tell me that the system partition is only 231GB (see above) and not 576 GB?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Did you select to encrypt system partition or entire HD? Is your D drive a different physical hard drive?<br /><br />Yes they can get the key required to decrypt your truecrypt drive if they have access to your machine while it is in its decrypted state.<br /><br />Yes they could possibly get the key even if you use a USB drive, for example if it is swapped out from memory to the HD. <br /><br />There are a few ways that you can make a high probability guess that someone has a hidden volume, but afaik there is mathematic security against this (meaning in theory they can&#039;t tell you have a hidden volume, but using data leaked to the OS or other things, they will probably be able to determine that you probably have a hidden volume). <br /><br />Fuck if I know,&nbsp; how many drives do you have tell me the configuration of your machine and which Truecrypt options you used.

				I think there&#039;s only one.<br /><br />But I recall selecting &quot;Encrypt System Partition/Drive&quot; from under &quot;System.&quot; I think I may have found the answer. <br /><br />Perhaps I&#039;m supposed to select Volumes&gt;Create New Volume&gt;Encrypt a non-system partition/drive&gt;Standard Truecrypt volume&gt;Select Device&gt;Harddisk 0&gt;Ok<br /><br />I selected the option that only encrypted my system partition (the C drive).<br /><br />Will Liberte or Truecrypt leave traces of the USB passwords on my hard drive?<br /><br />Thanks for your patience.
