				So basically what happened:<br /><br />I bought bitcoins through bitinstant --&gt; mtgox via MoneyGram. I went to my local store and did it and paid with a debit card (I know, I&#039;m an idiot).<br /><br />I then transfered said bitcoins to my wallet on my PC, and then to my SR address. Bought something, and that was the end of that.<br /><br />I then (week or so later), did the exact the same thing. Bit instant --&gt; mtgox, but this time I paid in cash, which I had just got from my ATM through the same Debit card. These bitcoins are currently unspent and sitting in my SR account.<br /><br />What I&#039;m freaking out about is getting caught. I recieved my order and all was good, its not even in my possession anymore (it was for a friend). But I bought from a reputable source and I didnt encrypt my address or our messages.<br /><br />Am I at risk of being caught? I&#039;ve been unable to sleep for the past week or so and I&#039;ve thrown up almost every day. I was unable to enjoy my vacation.<br /><br />Please give me some insight.<br /><br />I was very naive at the beggining, didn&#039;t know what I was doing.<br /><br />So is there a risk? Should I be concerned?<br />I know that if I ever ordered again (I only have once) I&#039;d do it with much more security.<br /><br />Also if it helps things, all the orders and bitcoins, ect, was made on my network at home, but mailed to another house (the recieving freind).<br /><br />Would that be able to help me if anything were to happen?

				I answered in your other thread (you made 2 by mistake).<br /><br />Does that mean the address you didnt encrypt is your friends and your friends name?<br /><br />In that case, you have even less to worry.<br />Neither can his name be linked to the payment, nor your name to receiving the drugs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Like I said in the other thread, make a new sr account and be sure to switch your id in every step. if you have only made one purchase, you dont have a reputation to lose anyway.

				Hello iambasictimes!<br /><br /><br />So sorry to hear that you have been ridden with anxiety through all of this. I think there&#039;s really little need to worry... as long as you follow the steps to keep yourself safe. I don&#039;t know how much volume goes through the site every day but I can say it&#039;s a mother load. Ninety nine plus percent gets through with no problem and no detection. <br /><br /><br />After an item arrives, your need to worry drops to zilch - obviously it wasn&#039;t the DEA mailing you as they don&#039;t mail drugs, and obviously it wasn&#039;t detected, as it would have been confiscated.<br /><br /><br />If you always select vendors with lots and lots of feedback you know they are successfully getting things through and remaining undetected.&nbsp; Bitcoins are 100% perfectly legal to conduct business. If you run them through a site like BTC Fog it shields their origin, but honestly if you&#039;re getting your BTC with cash through bitinstant, you&#039;re pretty much undetectable. <br /><br /><br />It sounds like the only improvement you could have made would be to encrypt your address with GPG. This protects you if SR is ever compromised by guaranteeing only the seller can read the message. This being said, once a seller marks an item as shipped the address is permanently expunged from the site. <br /><br /><br />Hope this helps calm your nerves!<br /><br /><br />Love<br />Angelina

				Thanks. <br /><br />Yes, the address was in my friends name, and the payment on my debit was made in my name.<br /><br /><br />My worry has dropped significantly, I&#039;m just worried about SR being found
