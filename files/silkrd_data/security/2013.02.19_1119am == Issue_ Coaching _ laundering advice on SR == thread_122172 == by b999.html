				I&#039;m a little concerned.&nbsp; I see services for sale on SR offering to coach vendors in vending and laundering.&nbsp; What would stop someone from the authorities signing up for this, and learning all the secrets and endangering us all?&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t SR remove these offers?<br /><br />I&#039;m just a little concerned that some are drunk on success and will trip up, potentially taking the whole thing down with them.

				yeah I suppose, but still it&#039;s a worry... some narc will just sign up the &#039;coaching&#039; and learn everything.&nbsp; Does seem kind of self defeating.
