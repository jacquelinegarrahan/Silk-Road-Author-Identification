				Hi Guys,<br /><br />It seems very difficult for us Aussies to purchase bit coins.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been scammed myself, but thankfully it was only a small amount (I thought it best to test the waters with a small amount.<br /><br />Anyway if anyone out there can recommend a way for us Aussies to purchase bit coins safely, it would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks Morphing<br />

				I just bought a Ukash voucher today at a local newsagency and will try the method that has been described lately in another thread (can&#039;t remember which one exactly off hand). It is quite a round-a-bout way but if it works then I&#039;ll be happy enough.

				This guy will accept cash or direct bank transfer for MTGOX USD or AUD <br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45458.0<br /><br />He is in Australia and has tons of money ready that is already in mtgox because he runs www.spendbitcoins.com<br /><br />You also might be able to find people who will sell you bit coins for cash at http://btcnearme.com/<br /><br />or at a local Bitcoin meetup group.&nbsp; Every meetup I have been to had lots of people exchanging cash for bit coins.<br /><br />Maybe this can help you guys out.<br />Good luck!

				Hi enddox,<br /><br />Buying a ukash voucher (as you have done) is exactly what I was planning on doing today. I&#039;ll get on to it this afternoon.<br /><br /><br />Hi, wjYDPHnu,<br /><br />I actually transferred some money to MTGOX, and just afterwards they closed their bank accounts, both Bank of Western Australia and NAB accounts. This is apparently due to a large number of fraudulant activities taking place on their accounts.<br /><br />I have sent them numerous emails, but to no avail, they havn&#039;t even responded.<br /><br />I now have the NAB fraud department looking in to it for me.<br /><br />If wjYDPHnu has a large amount of money in MTGOX, I can&#039;t imagine he&#039;d be to happy.<br /><br />Do you know anything about this?<br /><br />Thanks Morphing<br />

				I don&#039;t mind helping all of you out there in Australia. Just keep the good feed back coming, and donate a few coins =) <br /><br />There&#039;s another member here, who will try this, and I&#039;ll have them update you if and when they decide to have me help them out. It sucks to see things are getting more and more difficult to get coins. It would be nice to actually have a real, trust worthy SR person to assist in country to country to get the ball rolling in respect to funding and exchanging things. <br /><br />With all of you having difficulties, it puts a halt on sales, so it&#039;s in everyone&#039;s best interest, vendors especially, to keep the flow of coins going, and sales moving =) <br /><br />I don&#039;t mind helping

				Hi mysteriouspotions,<br /><br />Thanks for your offer of help, much appreciated. If anyone helps me out I&#039;ll always do the right thing by them and help where possible, we all need to stick together, that&#039;s the only way this thing will continue to work.<br /><br /><br />Hi Jesus Joints,<br /><br />Hopefully we&#039;ll eventually get our money back (I only deposited a small amount to test the waters THANK FUCK). They do say they will be reopening all of their accounts, once they get their fraud problems sorted out, and that we will all get our money eventually. My guess is it will take weeks, probably months. But like one of the others said they do have a reputation to uphold as a lot of people on here use them.<br /><br />Hi wjYDPHnu,<br /><br />Thanks for your advice I&#039;ll give it a try and let you know how I get on.<br /><br />Cheers Morphing<br /><br />

				http://buybitcoins.aunz.ws/<br /><br />yeah, this site is great, super quick turnaround and no ID needed whatsover.<br /><br />the one small issue is that up until yesterday (I think) he has been in a beta test stage and due to the overwhelming orders coming in he has to restructure things a bit.<br /><br />might be up to 2 weeks before he can take orders again.<br /><br />but, nevertheless, keep his site bookmarked aussies!!<br />

				Is it necessary to wash (tumble is a word I heard used as well) your bitcoins after depositing your cash? <br /><br />Is extra anonymity like this needed?<br /><br />If the police questioned you later and asked what happened to your bitcoins wouldn&#039;t it be easy to say that your account was hacked? Surely the onus is on them to show that you used them on SR (or elsewhere)?<br /><br />Thanx

				I just mine my coins so I don&#039;t need to worry about buying them, but you could try Bitpiggy if it&#039;s still up and running.&nbsp; Not the best exchange rate, but better than nothing.
