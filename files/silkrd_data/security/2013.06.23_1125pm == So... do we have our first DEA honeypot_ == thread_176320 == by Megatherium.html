				Just read it and thought I would drop it here:<br /><br />http://letstalkbitcoin.com/post/53700133097/users-bitcoins-seized-by-dea<br /><br />Don&#039;t know if DPR on anyone else with sufficient access wants to investigate. Could be a bit time consuming, could also be easy as fuck because those cunts have a different definition of OpSec.<br /><br />Do your homework, kids.

				I see nothing in that article that indicates it was related to SR. Transactions on the market are not in the block chain, so if it had any relation to SR at all, ie if the DEA met the guy through SR, it would be an out of escrow transaction.

				Yah the article is lacking in details.<br /><br />However, similarly to how Mt.Gox&#039;s Dwolla account was just suspended after they traced a deposit through the blockchain, I would guess it is possible for LEO/DEA to deposit funds into SR trace them through the blockchain, even through SR&#039;s mixer, and then go after anyone who ends up with those coins.<br /><br />Of course in order to determine who ends up with them they would have to eventually hit a BTC address which is known to be associated with a financial institution they could subpoena to learn how withdrew into cash.<br /><br />How likely is all of this I have no idea but it does not seem impossible.

				Huh. So they are in fact tracing people through the blockchain.<br /><br />Good to know. I mean, this is why there have been laundry sites, why SR uses a mixer, but it&#039;s helpful to know that these precautions are needed. Too easy to get lazy and buy into blase comfort offered by dubious strangers.

				That&#039;s not just you P2P, it&#039;s a pretty poorly written article. The crux is that a DEA public notice of seized property this month mentions that they seized a bitcoin address from a suspect, containing 11 BTC. There are no specifics given, other than it was for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, and that his AKA is &quot;Casey Jones&quot; who is also a SR vendor selling suboxone and methylone. What does it mean to &quot;seize&quot; a BTC account? They mention one address, so it&#039;s speculated that they physically seized the suspects computer with the wallet.dat file locally stored. The rest of the article is a half-assed blockchain analysis that comes to no conclusion. (I can&#039;t criticize too much -- blockchain analysis is beyond my ability as well) and an appeal for help from someone who actually knows how to do blockchain analysis.

				This Casey Jones requested a sample from me a 15 days ago. The crazy thing is, he messaged me from his vendor account, and willingly gave me his entire personal address, not a drop address.

You don&#039;t have to outrun the bear, just the other people doing illicit activities.

				An Eric Daniel Hughes is currently facing drug charges in Charleston, SC, for the distribution of Clenazepam, weed, and a few other drugs, and is now out on a $10,000 bond. I&#039;m not sure how the case relates to the seizure, as it looks as though his arrest was in early June, not April. Maybe the seizure was part of a case they were building, or maybe the DEA handed it over to local authorities (can they do this?) <br /><br />On another note, there have been some pretty funny articles about it. From The Fix:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;It remains unclear how exactly the Bitcoin was &#039;seized,&#039; but it&#039;s unlikely that it was literally plucked from the web... By comparing the time at which the DEA claims it seized the Bitcoins and the Bitcoin&#039;s transaction records, it seems the DEA caught the money as it came out from Bitcoin&#039;s security protocols, not before.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Someone obviously does not understand the concept of cryptocurrency.
