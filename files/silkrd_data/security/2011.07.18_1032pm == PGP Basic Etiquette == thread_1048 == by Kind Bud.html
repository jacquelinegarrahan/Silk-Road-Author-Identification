				PGP Basic Etiquette<br /><br />Many people are using PGP for the first time. <br />Here are three simple rules to follow on Silk Road.<br /><br />1)Label your public block<br />2)Place your PGP public block at the end of the plaintext message BEFORE encryption.<br />3)Be explicit about requiring PGP but try to respond to any PGP with PGP<br /><br />************************<br />Rule One:<br />Label your public block:<br />yourname@fakeORreal.com<br /><br />How<br />When you create a PGP it will ask your for a name and or an email. They can be fake, but should start with the username you are using to buy with.<br /><br />Why<br />Many Sellers have hundreds or thousands of PGP codes.&nbsp; To encode back to you they lookup&nbsp; that user name and if it is there, encode for you. (Faking someone else&#039;s username is a non-issue as only the intended recipient can decode.) If you use anonymous@anonymous.com&nbsp; a seller will not find you in the keyring and you will not get a PGP response. Example kindbud@onlyvalidonsilkroad.com works great (although a good PGPer would only respond on Silk Road with it)<br /><br />************************<br />Rule Two:<br />Place your PGP public block at the end of the message BEFORE encryption.<br /><br />How:<br />Plain text message<br />--senders public code block--<br />Then encrypt the whole thing<br /><br />This keeps the whole thing together and is easy to see if a response is required. As an added bounice&nbsp; and increased security, only the intended recipient can see who the sender was.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why:<br />Some people split their public block as separate from message. This means both that the message can be passed on without the block and that others my be able to see the public block for whom a response was not intended<br /><br />******************************<br />Rule Three:<br />Be explicit about requiring PGP but try to respond to PGP with PGP.<br /><br />How:<br />Say at the very top and at the bottom include “respond using PGP only please” if that is important to you. If you are responding to a PGP message, look though your address book for their user name (Rule 1) or it should be at the bottom of the message they sent to you (Rule 2). If you do not have a PGP code for them you may send them a message in cleartext if they were not explicit or notify them that PGP was not possible because of failure of Rule One and Rule Two <br /><br />Why:<br />Sellers get a lot of messages from people new to PGP. They may use it for only for their address or make a mistake about Rule One or Rule Two. Speed and responses are valued more than PGP security by most buyers so skipping PGP encryption is the correct choice under most circumstances if the buyer is nor explicit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This is a great post dude. <br /><br />Rule 1 is so important. I am so pissed trying to figure out who is whom when responding to PGPs. It&#039;s very frustrating.<br /><br />P+L

				Anyone got like a guide that shows you how to acquire PGP key and how to use it? Cause a simpleton like me is extremely confused when it comes to PGP. I understand that sellers are very serious about their privacy, so I don&#039;t want to be an ass sending unencrypted messages potentially putting them at risk.

				GPG is PGP (pgp is a company now, hence the name change)<br /><br />http://www.gnupg.org<br /><br />Windows<br />http://www.gpg4win.org/<br /><br />Mac<br />http://www.gpgtools.org/<br /><br />There are lots of pages about PGP, how to set up etc. download, install, and try it out -it is all pretty easy, but if you have any questions there are piles of dedicated people in the general web that are all about PGP/GPG<br /><br />&quot;GNU Privacy Assistant&quot; program is bundled and probably the easiest to start out with. You can import new keys from a text, asc or pgp file. You can use the clipboard to encrypt or decrypt. <br /><br />

				Is it considered rude if you pm someone nothing at all except your key or do most assume it means you want to talk encrypted and will respond with their key?<br /><br />And key at the top? I&#039;ve been putting it at the bottom but I&#039;m extremely new to gpg.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is probably a very stupid question but if someone gets hold of my private key can it be easily compromised - easily by LE is what I mean. <br /><br />One other thing, as far as random passphrases go, could you take an mp3, open it in a text editor&nbsp; and copy a predetermined amount of characters, lets say 5 lines and use that as a passphrase?&nbsp; The characters would appear crazy and I&#039;d assume that is&nbsp; &quot;random&quot; as you didn&#039;t determine the characters and you could just roll a die a few times, first roll amount of levels to go down in the file system, second roll amount of &quot;sideways&quot; dirs, third roll file as it appears in that directory while sorting by name,etc.<br /><br />Would this be a good password? <br /><br />Would something easily referenced but not remembered or recorded like the 10 horse race earning after a certain date , added to together?<br /><br />I want my shit like those IRA dudes that they caught and had the FBI on the stand asking if it was impossible. He said no but it would take a long time.&nbsp; They asked him if it would take over a year, he answered that if all the computers on this planet worked together to break the code everyone in this room would be dead before it were cracked.&nbsp; Or something along those lines.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If I receive a PM that&#039;s just a key, I assume they want to initiate an encrypted conversation and message them back accordingly. And even if your private key is compromised, they still need the passphrase to use it, although iirc I read somewhere that the government can force you to give up your key if you&#039;re arrested as a suspect for certain crimes or be charged with obstruction of justice? Not sure how valid that is though.

				I have used PGP for some time, but didn&#039;t know about the &quot;blind opening&quot; with your key thing.&nbsp; Point taken. :)<br /><br />I always put my key below the message the first time out, just so they know there&#039;s a message there, not just the key.&nbsp; <br /><br />As to the &quot;forced to give up your password&quot; issue-I just read a very long court case about this.&nbsp; Nope, didn&#039;t save the link, coz I didn&#039;t think anyone would want it.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; But basically it said that in the UK this is part of law, you must give up your password or you can be charged with a certain crime.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some of our UK guys will know that crime&#039;s name.<br /><br />In the US it&#039;s totally different.&nbsp; The fifth amendment protects us against that and even though they will stress you to provide it, if you have a whole disc that&#039;s done in TrueCrypt and they find it, there is *nothing* legal they can do to make you give up the password.&nbsp; I&#039;d always thought if that happened I&#039;d say &quot;oh, I used some random generated key thing and then I lost the document with it on it, so I can&#039;t get into it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just sitting there waiting to be reformatted&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, they won&#039;t believe it, but what&#039;s their rebuttal?&nbsp; :D

				That&#039;s actually a pretty good defense I think.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s very plausible a person could write out an extremely long passphrase that is random to them on a piece of paper they keep on them at all times.&nbsp; If that paper were to get lost he really would have no way of getting into it unless he could reconstruct it in ways only he knows.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1048.msg10232#msg10232">Quote from: joeblow2 on July 25, 2011, 08:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I&#039;d always thought if that happened I&#039;d say &quot;oh, I used some random generated key thing and then I lost the document with it on it, so I can&#039;t get into it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just sitting there waiting to be reformatted&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, they won&#039;t believe it, but what&#039;s their rebuttal?&nbsp; :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This part seems to confuse people more than anything else:<br /><br />You use VENDOR PUBLIC KEY BLOCK to encode FOR the vendor<br /><br />They use YOUR PUBLIC KEY BLOCK to encode for you.<br /><br />You give out, but do not use your own Public Key Block.<br />You can not decode messages you wrote once you encode them.

				Key signing is used for to prove you are the person in possession of the private key. It is useful to prove you are really you but isn&#039;t used as often in normal correspondence.&nbsp; GreenCo uses signing for continuing customer support, to prove that they really wrote something (like a coupon) without keeping any customer records. Silk Road uses it to prove official statements are really from him. <br /><br />People are expected to guard their private key, so it is theoretically harder to fake a signature than to hack someone&#039;s user account. <br /><br />There is no harm in using it all the time, just most people do not bother.

				Hey,<br />I&#039;m fairly new here and would just like to say this thread helped me out when getting used to PGP. This thread helped reinforce and reword the information in the GPG4Win compendium as well as the text instructions here (http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/). Mad thanks to the creator of each of these resources. I look forward to many successfully encrypted messages and hopefully transactions here on silk road.

				&nbsp;:) Kind Bud thanQ so much for this post, it helped bunches! Trying to get one&#039;s &quot;ducks in a row&quot; before making a purchase has proved to be quite &quot;taxing&quot; but thanks to members such as yourself, who can actually explain in LAYMAN&#039;S terms has made this process a little bit easier! Could someone please recommend what PGP program is the &quot;preferred means&quot; on this site? And also would it be possible, as soon as I trust myself to be able to actually SEND and encrypted message, for some1 to just let me test my newly acquired PGP skills by just accepting a test message? Many thanks in advance to the Sr. members and Newbies who take the time to explain these things. It must be really irritating to keep answering the same questions over and over but we really do appreciate!

				Hello all, first off let me thank you for all the great info on security and for all the technical tutorials.<br /><br />Okay, so I read the tutorial for GPGtools, authorized it so I can use it in the menus and went on to create my own key. So far so good. I get back to the browser and select someone&#039;s key (tried with the -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- thing and without it, don&#039;t really know where the key starts), try to import it but it says 0 keys in the gigatools pop up thing. I&#039;m surely missing a step here. Also tried to encrypt something, no luck.<br />Can someone give me hand on this? Thanks<br />

				Breakthru. I think I got it to work, at least within the text editor.<br /><br />In the remote possibility someone actually comes back to this post and check on things, I have another issue, it is not related to pgp, but I guess there&#039;s no need to open a new thread over it. Often when browsing with Tor, here or anywhere else, I get reverted to the onion.to disclaimer, not sure why but it makes it a painful experience to travel around. Any info on this?

One of its security features is the fact that when Tails is powered-down, all data created during your Tails session is erased. This is fabulous for those who do not wish to leave traces of their activities for others to find. <br /><br />However, that poses a problem for anyone using PGP in Tails, as any keys that are created&nbsp; (or other people&#039;s keys that are added to your PGP keyring) during your Tails session are lost when the session ends. <br /><br />Accordingly, it is necessary to backup your PGP keyrings to a USB stick BEFORE shutting-down Tails. Here&#039;s how: <br /><br />* Double-click on the folder labeled &quot;Amnesia&#039;s home&quot; on the Desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp; A new window will open up, with two panes: the left-most pane will contain a list of places that are accessible. <br /><br />* Plug-in your USB stick that you wish to backup your PGP keys to. <br /><br />&nbsp; Within a few seconds, you&#039;ll see an new entry in the left-most pane; this will be your USB flashdrive. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Press F3 to open-up an extra pane; key Control + H to make the hidden files visible. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; You will now see the contents of the &#039;amnesia&#039; folder in both panes. <br />&nbsp; <br />* Click on the entry for your USB stick in the left-most pane. <br /><br />&nbsp; You will now see the middle pane with the contents of your USB stick. <br />&nbsp; <br />In the right-most pane, locate the .gnupg folder (Note the dot &quot;.&quot; in front of gnupg)<br /><br />Drag-and-drop the .gnupg folder to the middle pane (i.e. to your USB stick). <br /><br />Your PGP keyrings, GPG configuration file, and trust database are now all backed-up to your USB stick. <br /><br />* When you go to use Tails again, repeat this process, only this time, you drag the .gnupg folder from your USB stick to the amnesia folder, thus restoring your PGP keyrings. (In other words, you drag the .gnupg folder from the middle pane (your USB stick) to the right-most pane, the Tails Amnesia folder). <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks Guru as ever you&#039;re a lifesaver +1<br /><br />V.

Before I read this thread I was just going to include 2 blocks on my first purchase.&nbsp; 1st block would have been my address, second block my public key.&nbsp; Well, I tried to encrypt my public key along with my address, but my gpg doesn&#039;t seem to want to do it or it&#039;s just taking an extreme amount of time to complete.&nbsp; &nbsp;Encrypting my address is instantaneous after I select the recipient(s).<br /><br />My question is, is it normal for it to take a long time to encrypt a message that size?&nbsp; And if it is not going to work would it just be okay to include the message block(address) and my public key block?<br /><br />Oh, and one more question.&nbsp; In another post it says you can&#039;t decrypt a message unless you add your own key when you select recipients, but I tried that exact thing a few days ago and I was able to decrypt a message that I didn&#039;t select myself as a recipient.&nbsp; Does this mean my gpg app isn&#039;t working correctly?<br /><br />A bit concerned before I put my name and address out there.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any input!<br /><br />EDIT : It seems the recipient selection window had popped up beneath another open window.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this will help others that may have a similar issue.

				<br />Hi Parapsy, I&#039;ve sent you a PM containing an encrypted message.<br /><br />Feel free to send me one back, if you want to.<br /><br />By the way, I found your public key in the relevant forum thread by doing a search, but you can make it slightly easier for others if you include a link to it in your Forum Signature (to edit it, mouse over the Profile button and click ForumProfile in the drop-down menu). In your case the URL would be this one:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg425380#msg425380<br /><br />Good luck<br />

				Extremely helpful thread...<br /><br />I really like the tip in Rule 2, I love those great ideas that are so simple... encrypt your public key!&nbsp; Genius!<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t want to step on the OP&#039;s toes, but I found this tutorial that was very simple and easy... 32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />Thing I love about it, the tool doesn&#039;t have an installer runs completely from a folder, as the name says great for running off USB.&nbsp; And it is very simple...

				@quale: You don&#039;t need to encrypt to yourself, except when you want to check to make sure the right data got encrypted; once you&#039;re comfortable that you&#039;re doing the process correctly, you only need to select the vendor&#039;s key when encrypting (this will save you a tiny amount of time in the long run). Note: I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re making a mistake, just taking an extra step.<br /><br />@thread:<br />How about, when sharing your public key, also share the first 18 ASCII characters of ciphers addressed to you? It appears to me that the first 18 characters are always the same for a given recipient. I believe this first portion of data would just be your &quot;name&quot; and email or key fingerprint, but I&#039;m not sure (any experts want to weigh in?). I can&#039;t think of any security holes with this method (anyone who gets your key can figure out your first 18 immediately), and this makes it so people sending you messages can quickly self-test their encryption without having to wait for a reply from you.<br /><br />Example: for the test pair Testy Teste (teste@tes.ty), the first 18 characters are always &quot;hIwDfNaI6o1RN6sBA/&quot;. This means that when someone encrypts a message for Testy, all they have to do is check that those first 18 characters match up, and they&#039;ll at least know they got the recipient correct (thus avoiding &quot;error: unknown recipient&quot;, which can sometimes delay transactions by a full day or more).<br /><br />Therefore, at the end of Testy&#039;s profile, he would write something like:<br /><br />&quot;<br />Please encrypt all sensitive messages, including shipping address, using my PGP key below:<br /><br />First18: hIwDfNaI6o1RN6sBA/<br />(when encrypting messages to me, please make sure the first 18 characters match above before sending)<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mI0EUOzStQEEAK2Tx6N21SSTyJFxJ9h6/o1WSj/7LxtlwKpc7s/uNAyoCr92n1it<br />7gFYbQ9aBJykTueVTLzmvAiLhFJTxHrKetedlEaypYD1W+vMuQ1w9DCpLLrlTChs<br />ke+JHI+C1ht4/1Nx3UtFgqpQo+Rmuwh09Xx2SFRc4Il+xkaJjNLBp6HJABEBAAG0<br />GlRlc3R5IFRlc3RlIDx0ZXN0ZUB0ZXMudHk+iLgEEwECACIFAlDs0rUCGwMGCwkI<br />BwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEBv7J+jY7+5evtcEAIBdl7dIPMWdhvTk<br />4b/IakLAkT7hwh72Cbd/YOx6c7ETjm7teO/NpComZfTX4W5Y0r0g6wJ1OPUjmjIV<br />/hl4om2yyAM1H0y0QUocx64K/MAComblqb/DU0IkUd9dofeKRxv3mylpLjDSvB2n<br />skaEHDC30petlfA7NGvLyztwyGztuI0EUOzStQEEAKusa3Q2C1OcAVN7M+NQ6POY<br />aNPMoWCRb0qrRnihEL0yajImwKD2BOpd8Vmb3YE3+w4AOsKE6IH620qukX2HAiQl<br />HSNOQbELWX4xDiNT8YiAvMpELjyz4Y2JZmwtiyOBigJzynQlWrZYzK9UiOGUIpS/<br />FHtmqFmA2Y9qfpr3vhPHABEBAAGInwQYAQIACQUCUOzStQIbDAAKCRAb+yfo2O/u<br />Xmx6A/9ZDaIeByl2kkK10PhGGw2eUOlokobu3iEx8kjxJbx+Ib5LRcVkf8FaFCE/<br />raQr/QTxuf4RP80SOS5A9DZuQbSrCTUoei77VDKX2m3wq4x3TrjvXrm7JCOsaA6T<br />xa9rg66c0YuFcPx+tx7GNZb3eOs3M92OYX8y1L0VsIWwUdSjKw==<br />=iAq5<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />&quot;<br /><br />(I included the key so you can try it yourself - or, just try on one of your own keys)<br />(note: this is an RSA 1024 key for compactness, but it still seems to be 18 characters for longer algorithms like RSA 3072)<br /><br />To the more experienced SR/PGP users - if you can think of any reason why this is insecure or won&#039;t work (e.g. perhaps the first 18 chars are not sufficiently specific) please share, or if you think this warrants a new thread, let me know and I&#039;ll make one.

Also, it only seems to work in terminal, not via any GUIs I&#039;ve tried (I assume most buyers will be using a GUI). <br /><br />Also, it requires an extra step before sending the message (in the case that a newer PGP user wanted to verify before sending). <br /><br />My intention was to make this self-check available at a glance, especially for beginning users who don&#039;t know keys from ciphers; this is also to help such users learn basic encryption without having to ask for help (&quot;did I do this right?&quot; - now they can check for themselves).
