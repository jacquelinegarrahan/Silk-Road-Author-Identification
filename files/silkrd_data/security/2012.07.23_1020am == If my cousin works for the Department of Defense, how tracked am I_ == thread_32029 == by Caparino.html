				he sounds like a proper cock mate - family usually comes first unless you&#039;re dealing with those sorts of cunts. i have an uncle that&#039;s robbing the government blind claiming for shit he doesn&#039;t need and i don&#039;t even like the cunt but he&#039;s family you know, so what can you do? i ain&#039;t grassing him up, just hoping he gets his benefits looked into.<br /><br />&nbsp;look into tor bridges, then your ISP can&#039;t even see you&#039;re using tor. i think it was vlad1mir did a thread on it. they can&#039;t break tor encryption, but your ISP might tell them you are going through tor on a regular basis. get a throwaway mobile for any shady conversations you need to have as well, and use it away from your home in preferably a built up area, like the high street of a town<br /><br />stay safe mate. and fucking punch your dick of a cousin in the face. he&#039;ll like that ;)

				I agree a lot was left out. And it could be Easy to leave the room for a sec and have no idea. If its a smart phone wipe it and start over and also take the back off and see if anything there. If he didn&#039;t touch your phone he could home put something in your house or car to.

				What if this was a prank set up by your cousin, so that he could be all cocky/agent-like in your face? I wouldn`t know whether to laugh or feel bad for you.&nbsp; :-\ If this what the Department of Defense really does? I really doubt its something that even concerns them to be honest.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know if you&#039;d be getting tracked because of him, but more because of your revolutionary acts that have classified you as a domestic &quot;terrorist&quot;. Who knows, they might want to find any dirt on you and arrest you for that (possession) so that you aren&#039;t doing anything else. There&#039;s a case of Occupiers getting harassed for the stupidest things because they are being watched. I made a lot of assumptions in this post so I don&#039;t really know what you did.

				I&#039;m thinking TheAbsurd is on the right track here.... so what if Caparino it is you that&#039;s the problem and it&#039;s you that got your cousin in trouble?&nbsp; not the other way around.<br /><br />Are you actually associating with domestic terrorists in any way???<br /><br />If so then they&#039;re not monitoring you because your cousin works for the DOD, they&#039;re monitoring you because you&#039;re on a terrorist watch-list.<br /><br />Then your cousin, who isn&#039;t doing anything wrong, tries to get his clearance renewed so he can keep his job and he gets dragged into a room and grilled for hours by the special investigations folks on what association he has with you or the &quot;terrorists&quot; you&#039;re dealing with.<br /><br />If that&#039;s what&#039;s going on your cuz did you favor.&nbsp; He also did something stupid and risked that clearance by talking to you.&nbsp; A TS clearance is worth a ton of money for your career and If I (or most anyone else) were in his shoes I wouldn&#039;t have told you a damn thing, I&#039;d have just cut contact with you, and they coulda dragged you off to Guantanamo bay and it&#039;d be alright as long as that big paycheck kept coming.<br /><br />If you&#039;re on a terrorist watch list then YOU are going to draw unwanted attention to anyone you associate with.<br /><br />You&#039;ll also draw unwanted attention to any website you visit or forum you post on.<br /><br />if they really really believe you&#039;re a terrorist even encryption won&#039;t help you.&nbsp; Most any government in the world can decrypt your data very very quickly with no more than you and a rubber hose (I hear the Chinese &amp; Russians especially are very very good at that).<br /><br />and oscarzululondon, it&#039;s not just every landline in the western world that&#039;s monitored by some government (US or other), it&#039;s more likely almost every cell / landline / internet connection on planet earth has somebody monitoring it.&nbsp; But if the cousin is under the umbrella of the DoD (as in he&#039;s a DOD employee) then he cannot directly access ANY of that data and I doubt anyone from another compartment would give it to him intentionally.&nbsp; But if he was getting grilled on it then he probably woulda figured out what the investigators knew pretty quick.<br /><br />In the US things are highly compartmentalized.&nbsp; You may have a clearance to do missile launch systems, but you won&#039;t be cleared to warhead design.&nbsp; You may do DoD weapons acquisitions, or troop deployment strategies, or DoD logistics, or whatever but if you&#039;re a DoD branch you don&#039;t get access to classified data from other branches or departments.<br /><br />Bob<br /><br />
