				I was hoping for some expert advice from you guys on here about going anon.<br /><br />So I will be going to the US from the UK as a vistor, but due to the documentation I have, I will be able to work out there.<br /><br />So therefore my questions are these - what documents etc should I destroy before leaving the UK, I don&#039;t want to leave a trace and want to bring everything tracked to me down to a minimum. I have been using tails for a long time so there is no mention of such move on a recoverable HDD.<br /><br />When I arrive I will be entering on a UK passport claiming that I am seeing Friends for two/three months thus the reason for my entry - I also have over Â£15k in my bank account as I know they like to ensure you can acctually afford your trip. I will be staying with a friend for a week and then moving to another location (different from ESTA).<br /><br />When out and about in USA, what key things should I be doing to stay under the radar? I&#039;m thinking an unregistered phone, anon reloadable bank card - but want more ideas. <br /><br />Obviously not doing stupid things like logging onto Facebook, Twitter etc - they have no mention that I am going and will continue to be that way. I may just swtich them off the day I go (wish I never even joined FB and Twitter all those years ago!!)<br /><br />Another question is how I would keep in contact with family. I&#039;m thinking just both run tails and ensure PGP encryption. I think things like Skype are out of the question unless anyone knows how to make this untraceable....<br /><br />Looking forward to your tips.<br /><br />PS I have not done anything illegal in the UK to prompt this move, it&#039;s just something I am doing.

				I am not sure why you want to be in the US so badly. Every sensible person I know here wants out, as soon as possible. One of the reasons for that is because our system does not really allow for &quot;anons.&quot; Everything worth doing requires identification that has to be verified via a government database, i.e. driver&#039;s license #, SSN, etc.<br /><br />All this to say, staying here longer than 3 months as a foreign tourist is illegal, so yes, you would be breaking the law. In addition, there is a database record of you having left the country once you leave, so you may as well shout it to the world. You want to leave anonymously, you&#039;re going to have to get to know some very devious individuals that are able to get you a real passport of someone that looks like you.<br /><br />Also, you mentioned destroying documents. What would this do? Every piece of information about you, if you live in a first world country (and you do), is in a government database. There is no &quot;destroying documentation.&quot; In addition to this, I don&#039;t know why your money would be in a bank account if you intend to stay anon. Everywhere you use your card to pay for something, there is a record of the date, time, transaction amount, and, likely, a snapshot of you doing the transaction by one of our many friendly cameras that exist in every public place/business. The US is not a friendly place, especially when it comes to illegal immigrants. If you do not have the resources (it sounds like you do not) and the bankroll (you do not) to live truly free and anonymously in the US for a decent lot of time, then do not attempt it. It is ok, though. There are plenty of countries that are far superior to the US and have much more limited governments. Just do your homework.
