				I am New to SR, and planning my first purchase, I don&#039;t as of yet have any bitcoins. I am from the UK, I have my wallet on blockchain ready, I was going to get my bitcoins by bank deposit into virwox then change to bitcoins then into wallet but turning out to be a ball ache with that second life shit n what have you..<br />&nbsp;<br />So anyway I was thinking of bank depositing straight into blockchain which doesn&#039;t sound ideal, but then when I put them into SR they get washed anyway, don&#039;t they? So can it be as simple as <br /><br />my bank&gt; block chain (btc)&gt; SR account&gt; escrow&gt; pgp address to vender&gt; item arrives, bitcoins into vendors account...?

				Check out BTCxUK dude, can&#039;t vouch for him enough. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83535.msg707476<br /><br />Process is really simple, email them to get a price, then bank transfer the money over (can be cash over the counter at their branch) then confirm with a wallet address. <br /><br />Process as a graph thing would be:<br /><br />Email&gt;deposit cash&gt;(blockchainwallet)&gt;SR account&gt;Escrow&gt;Product&gt;Finalize

				virwex.com is a SCAM as are all other BTC scams that offer BTC way below the market rate.

				Thanks for the ssuggestion SNSD, though I&#039;m very hesitant to sending any person money, as I&#039;m reading about all these scams,&nbsp; a bank deposit or that ping it to a well known website like block chain would feel safer. Shame about all these scammers!<br /><br />And connoisseur, there maybe a difference between virwex and virmox, never the less I&#039;m not goin down that route!<br /><br />Do you guys see anything wrong with my plan above? How come more people don&#039;t just bank deposit or use that Barclays ping it straight into blockchain to convert into btc?

				I may be monging it here, not quite understanding, I&#039;m using block chain can I do physical deposits? If this is possible, I assume I&#039;ll need block chains bank details then am I right in saying I have to go one of the branches of the bank they&#039;re using (not sending from my bank as I&#039;m pretty sure that would be the same as online faster payment?) and deposit into their account?<br /><br />Thanks for your help

				If someone isn&#039;t smart enough to tell the difference between the words VIRWEX (scam site) and VIRWOX (legit currency exchange site), then maybe they shouldn&#039;t be trying to buy Bitcoins at all...

				I was that pointing out that I attempted to use virwox the legit one not virwex. I&#039;ve never been on virwex. But thanks for that smart arse&nbsp; ???

After all (and to your credit), you correctly wrote &quot;virwox&quot; in your OP. One letter can make all the difference when you&#039;re typing things online. Even though you wrote it &quot;virwox,&quot; connoisseur assumed that you were planning to use &quot;virwex&quot; and that is the kind of simple mistake that will cost you your Bitcoins...or your freedom.
