				Say the cops went through your bank transactions and found evidence of Bitcoin purchasing, what excuse could/would you give for doing it?

				Bitcoins could be a great investment opportunity based on how much it has risen in value. The Bitcoin developer team doesn&#039;t work on the software with the intention of supporting Silk Road, there are tons of potential applications. Also, it won&#039;t happen. If you get caught it will be another way.

Not that its illegal, but since when have jurors not judged by emotion? But I think if your actually that deep in that your going to court you are screwed.

				I&#039;ve often discussed with bank teller&#039;s etc. how bitcoins are a lucrative forex like exchange because there is a definite degree of predictability in market flow (vs. trading Forex or other markets).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Typically on a daily basis the value of BTCs fluctuates enough that if you have enough in your portfolio you could easily turn a profit because transaction fees aren&#039;t $20 a transaction (like if you were to trade on NYSE).&nbsp; I&#039;ve made ... money doing this and its quite simple.<br /><br />There&#039;s also predictability in the technology used to generate bitcoins.&nbsp; When AMD (ATI) announced it&#039;s white paper release of it&#039;s 7xxx lineup the value of bitcoins dropped sharply, but the release was known ahead of time, so as long as you&#039;re logged into your BTC exchange service at that time you can buy them for $3.50ea.&nbsp; This drop was brief because these types of market&#039;s tend to re-equilibriate and also the $/mhash to buy 7950s/7970s for BTC mining isn&#039;t impressive.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could go on, but you get the jist.&nbsp; I&#039;m by no means an economist, I think Pine is the one to talk to about all this stuff actually, i&#039;m just describing to you situations i&#039;ve taken advantage.<br /><br />In short, tell the LE or whoever that you buy bitcoins to trade them on other bitcoin exchange market&#039;s and they are just part of you&#039;re investment portfolio.<br />

				There&#039;s lots of places that take them, but do many only take BC? Otherwise why would you legitimately bother with the hassle?<br /><br />Indeed that&#039;s the issue I&#039;ve always had, because I do agree if you were caught, you&#039;d want to explain why other than SR.
