				Hi,<br />I recently accessed my MTGOX account from TOR and now it&#039;s been frozen until I get it verified.<br />I was wondering if there&#039;s anything I should know about getting my account verified.<br />&gt;Should I not give them my real info?<br />&gt;Can I fake it?<br />&gt;Has anyone else faked it?<br />&gt;Is it worth faking it?<br />&gt;Usually takes 10 days? Accurate?<br /><br />If anyone&#039;s verified their account, insight would be much appreciated!<br />&nbsp;:)

				Do you have any funds in it? If not, ditch it. If yes, you can buy fake ID on BMR and use it to verify MtGox.<br /><br />Never access MtGox or any other exchange via Tor. VPNs with dedicated IPs are cheap and widely available. Use the VPN on top of Tor. You -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN -&gt; MtGox

				It was an accident, and yes I have 1700 usd in it.<br />I just wanna get it out and ditch mtgox forever.<br />I don&#039;t wanna risk having the AML team refuse my verification, anything I should be worried about?<br /><br />

				I have to say that I have no personal experience with MtGox verification. It&#039;s up to you if you want to take a chance with fake docs.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;d just send them my real docs, and be more careful in the future. A bit of paranoia is fine but the &#039;risk&#039; here is tiny.

				I have multiple accounts... including a legitimate one.&nbsp; They&#039;re easy to fake if you know you&#039;re way around Photoshop.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth faking.&nbsp; It took about four days on average for mine.<br /><br />I would start fresh, though.&nbsp; There are probably help desk tickets about your accessing from Tor and I wouldn&#039;t want ANY kind of dirt like that associated with my identity.&nbsp; If you verify this account, fake EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				do you think they&#039;d delete everything on my mtgox account if i delete the account after verification? or would they hold on to my documents?

				Expect them to keep your info record for at least a year to comply with various AML laws.

				well I&#039;m sure people think it&#039;s a bad idea...but I was in your same situation and I did verify (with legitimate information that is). It actually took quite a while (I believe 11 days) and they actually have a little counter on the page that shows your place in the queue. <br />Yes, it&#039;s technically possible that my purchasing of BTC could be traced all the way to whatever product used for, but I honestly can&#039;t imagine that occurring. I wouldn&#039;t recommend sending direct from MtGox to SR, but if you send to your wallet client and then later on to SR...well, I think LE would really have to be looking for you for anything to happen. Again, I absolutely know there are holes and privacy risks so I guess it comes down to personal comfort. Either way, good luck getting things sorted out!<br />Cheers
