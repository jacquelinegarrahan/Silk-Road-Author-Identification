				I read the two stickied threads under Shipping on package profiling and former UPS employee advice for vendors. As a buyer, I realize there isn&#039;t a lot I can do aside from carefully choosing a vendor who has a good reputation and positive customer comments about stealth.<br /><br />It occurs to me, though, that I used to get all kinds of packages when I ordered stuff off ebay - with hand-written addresses and printed labels, heavily or sparsely taped, strangely weighted and generally balanced, etc., all of them with 100% legal contents. Now I haven&#039;t bought anything off ebay for a long while. I occasionally get stuff off of Amazon but of course that is marked as such. This means that when I order off SR vendors, 100% of the non-Amazon packages I get sent (except around Christmas or my birthday) will contain stuff I&#039;d rather the postman or LE not be checking out but I&#039;m not sure how to figure this. Am I better off ordering some stuff off ebay to dilute the contraband among some harmless parcels, or are more packages more likely to prompt an inspection? (but then, if they check out a package or two and it&#039;s harmless stuff from ebay vendors, will they just ignore further parcels going to me no matter how dodgy?) I only plan to order domestic (at least to start) so customs is not a factor.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />oldtoby

				In my opinion you shouldn&#039;t worry that much I have received hundreds of packages with both drugs and legal things. Usually the packages from ebay look weird as fuck so I don&#039;t think receiving a normal letter would be a problem. Make sure the vendor you are ordering from is vacuum sealing his products.<br /><br />You don&#039;t want the post man to deliver an envelope with a strong smell of weed. That would be dodgy.<br /><br />As long as you know the vendor is doing his job properly, you should be safe.
