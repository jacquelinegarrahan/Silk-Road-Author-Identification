				I was expecting a letter today, so I spent the majority of this afternoon riding around on my bike, casually stalking the mailmen. I wasted a few hours, and probably smell like balls, but I got some possibly valuable information and exercise. I now have a good idea of who the postmen are, and their routes and routines; where they park the trucks, and go out walking for deliveries from there, how far down the route my address is, normal delivery times, etc. <br /><br />I was also looking for evidence of surveillance, unusually parked cars, police presence in the neighborhood, etc. <br /><br />Of course the letter didn&#039;t arrive today, which is disappointing. But I like to think that I got a bit of valuable information. I&#039;ve been noting the delivery times on past packages, and so far the only thing out of the ordinary would be International Express shipping, which comes earlier in the day than most, via USPS minivan, and requires a signature. To my knowledge, priority mail does not require a signature. <br /><br />I was also trying to be outside on the patio relaxing when the mail arrived, so I can see the mailman approaching and accept the parcel outside, and if it required a signature feign surprise, and state that said person wasn&#039;t home, and deny the package. <br /><br />So what do you guys think? Am I overly paranoid? I believe knowledge is power, and it would be pretty hard to perform a controlled delivery if I know the routes and positions of where the mail trucks are supposed to be at, and I&#039;m outside when the mailman arrives. From what I&#039;ve established, a police officer will disguise himself as the postman, and solicit a signature for your package, with surveillance watching the premises. I don&#039;t believe an undercover officer would go through an hour of normal deliveries and stick to the routine before doing a controlled delivery. My feeling is they would park a postal truck very near the home, earlier in the day, substitute the mailman for an officer, and would have surveillance on the street. If I know what to expect, there is no way that they can surprise me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also been watching a lot of Burn Notice lately, so that probably doesn&#039;t help. <br /><br />So what do you guys think, is it a bad idea to take a casual bike ride around the neighborhood a few hours or so before expecting a delivery, and casually search for the mail truck, to see who is driving it, walking the routes, and estimate how far down the route they are? How about quick sweeps for surveillance, i.e, big dark SUV&#039;s, Crown Victoria&#039;s, unusual cars parked on the street, etc. Getting to know your neighborhood seems wise, so you can see if anything is out of place that day. How about sitting outside reading a magazine on your patio while waiting for the postman to arrive? <br /><br />I also accept the possibility that I&#039;m completely insane and paranoid. But from what I&#039;ve read about controlled deliveries, it seems like they be avoided with a bit of information about your surroundings, and scanning the area for unusual activity and being extra cautious a few hours before the mail is expected to arrive. <br /><br />Has anyone here ever had to sign for a SR parcel via USPS? Have you stalked your mail carrier? Are you friendly toward him, or consider him to be the enemy, and to be avoided at all costs? <br /><br />I now know that I am at the end of the route, and have noted my mail usually gets delivered at a certain time, and the mail trucks are usually a block or so down the street and the carrier walks the block from there. Any special attention or behavior will be easily noticed by myself. I plan on taking a short bike ride tomorrow as well, to scan the surrounding area a few hours before the expected delivery. It&#039;s unfathomably hot outside, so anyone parked in a vehicle is a dead giveaway, and I can now estimate when the mailman will arrive at my address based on his truck location in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Any input is appreciated. I&#039;m just curious as if anyone has performed surveillance on a postman or their neighborhood before.

				lol. I admire your &quot;stalking&quot; skills. I usually spend my afternoons (when the mail comes) on my front porch with my laptop and a glass of wine. I do have a regular mailman, we know each other by sight. But lately I&#039;ve had a different mailman everyday for the past week (excluding sunday), I assume that my regular mailman has gone on vacation or fired/replaced. the new mailman is just as nice and considerate. By considerate, for example, I get a non-criminal package (duckies, I am obsessed with rubber duckies), and I had ordered a package of decorated duckies. The new mailman came up on the porch with the box, I gleefully exclaimed &quot;omg it came! that&#039;s for me!&quot;. He laughed and handed it to me. I find that my naivety and general sense of complacence wouldn&#039;t make them suspect that I receive drugs via mail. I like to order random shit online to mix it up for my post workers so they don&#039;t suspect me using my mailing address for illegitimate purpose.&nbsp; <br /><br />I live like 3 blocks from the local police station, they don&#039;t give a shit about my neighborhood unless something actually happens. My neighborhood is like a vegan/hippie/80&#039;s crowd so everyone&#039;s pretty cool, and it&#039;s full of families not like ghettos full of gangbangers. <br /><br />my advice for you is to keep to your routine, don&#039;t deviate from it. They&#039;ll have a reason to suspect something amiss if you deviate from it. If you do regularly go out on bike rides around the neighborhood, do that. If not, the mailman&#039;ll be like &quot;hmm, this guy is starting a new exercise program or he&#039;s expecting something to happen...hmm what could that be?&quot;.

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;re being too paranoid at all actually. Maybe if it&#039;s just like 10 grams of drugs or less... then yea i would say what you&#039;re doing is a bit of overkill, but it doesn&#039;t really hurt does it? I think it&#039;s good you&#039;re being so cautious. After all, you are risking quite a lot! I&#039;ve actually given the counter surveillance thing a LOT of thought as I have seen much success with MDMA in the last couple of months. And at a certain point, it&#039;s really not cool to send so much mdma or any other drug to your own place. And I&#039;m not one that really trusts people, so I don&#039;t like spreading my orders to multiple addresses(my friend&#039;s addresses)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If I were to order kilo+ of anything illegal in one package, best believe I&#039;ll be doing a shit ton of counter surveillance.<br /><br />Say I&#039;m getting 5 keys of mdma from germany in a single parcel..<br /><br />1.) I&#039;m not going to have my real name on it. I&#039;d probably rent out a place using fake information(ID, pay stubs, etc.) I&#039;ll do my research before picking out the residence. How easy will it to be to do surveillance on the area around the location? What post office handles the mail for this residence? This second question is extremely important and you&#039;ll see why later.<br /><br />2.) I&#039;ll make sure the package requires a signature.<br /><br />3.) I definitely will not accept the package from the mailman. Maybe I&#039;ll look out from nearby to see if it&#039;s the usual mailman though. This would be one of the first few clues as to whether there is a controlled delivery about to take place. After they try to deliver it(and fail since no one will be at the residence), then they&#039;re going to leave a notice at the address, and leave it at the local post office.<br /><br />4.) I&#039;m going to let about a week go by. Say LE is waiting for me to go to the post office to pick it up. Longer I wait, more resources + time I waste on their end of things. Once enough time has gone by, to where the chance of the post office being hot goes way down.... Then it is time for the pickup team to setup surveillance at the post office. 2-3 people should do just fine. 2 people looking out. Gotta start surveillance on the post office VERY early. I&#039;d probably start at 2 in the morning. Looking for ANYTHING suspicious. Now, if I did my research on picking out the address that the drugs are being delivered to.. then the post office to do surveillance on will be advantageous. Ideally, I should have picked out a smaller post office, one that&#039;s not too busy, one that i&#039;ve already scoped out to figure out what cars the employees drive, what time they show up to work, hopefully the post office is a little isolated from other buildings, etc so I can easily spot things out of the ordinary..... Then team member A goes in with the proper fake ID matching the name on the package, and the notice left at the residence by the mailman. And team member A claims the package...<br /><br /><br />

You wouldn&#039;t use the same envelope to ship a gram as you would an ounce so you wouldn&#039;t use the same method to ship 1KG when you are shipping 5KG. As for discussing how to do it that&#039;s not something I discuss openly and I generally don&#039;t explain how to do it for free.

I have quite a lot of experience and have multiple methods and I have only ever lost 1 shipment which was a key of M1 but that&#039;s because I left it to a mate and he completely ballsed it up. My prices aren&#039;t just a few quid though mate. Depending on how sophisticated you wana get I can charge between 50-100BTC but obviously I&#039;ll go into great depth and teach you all the methods I know. :)
