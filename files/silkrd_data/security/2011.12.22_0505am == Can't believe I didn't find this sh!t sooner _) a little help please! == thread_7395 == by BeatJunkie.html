				I just found out today about &quot;deep web&quot;.. so after endless videos and articles I decided &quot;why not&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />so then, I stumbled on this page. Not sure how I&#039;ve missed this for so many years.&nbsp; I&#039;m still researching the best way to get bitcoins.. any help in the right direction would be great. Although, I&#039;m taking it real slow on here at first just for good measure. So, any tips you could throw my way would be much appreciated!!<br /><br />- peace<br /><br />

				Basic tips:&nbsp; NEVER use the hidden wiki - you will hit phishing sites several times a day and your btc will be cleaned out in minutes.<br /><br />Bitcoins - if you are in US or Canada, the large exchanges are your best bet.&nbsp; MTGox accepts anonymous cash deposits at Chase bank branches (you have to print off their form from mtgox.com) and funds usually show up same day.&nbsp; From there you can have the coins in your account within a few hours and you aren&#039;t paying some crazy ass 15% exchange fee (more like 1%).<br /><br />As a new buyer, a lot of sellers (myself included) will ask you to either finalize early or use a direct-buy listing.&nbsp; This is because the majority of established sellers have been scammed by new buyers, not their regulars.&nbsp; Once you have some trust and some business behind you on here things ease up a bit.<br /><br />Participate in the forums.&nbsp; Before you have any questions, though, there are thousands of topics on here that cover probably anything you could think to ask.&nbsp; I recommend checking out the security forums as this will help you set up pgp (recommended for shipping information), know the safest way to address packages for receipt, etc.&nbsp; Questions are fine too though :)<br /><br />Lurk the Rumor Mill section of the forums.&nbsp; The best sellers on here have tons of customers who will back them up with detailed reviews of all aspects of doing business with them in the forums.&nbsp; These customers don&#039;t receive anything for doing this, they just want to share with the community - take advantage of it.&nbsp; You will quickly learn who and who not to deal with.&nbsp; Also check the scammer forum topic located in Rumor Mill - this is a regularly updated thread done by buyers.&nbsp; If you find a seller you like over on SR, check them out here and see what the latest customers are saying.&nbsp; Unfortunately with this business you can run into some inconsistencies in terms of performance, and you don&#039;t want to hit a seller going through a lapse.<br /><br />And finally, the most important advice:&nbsp; If you want cannabis or cyanescens mushrooms, come to me first :)<br /><br />Anarcho47

				mtgox requests &#039;account verification&#039;<br /><br />How To Become a Verified Customer?<br />To become a verified Mt.Gox customer you need to submit the following documentation: <br />1. A copy of your valid government issued photo identification (Driver&#039;s license, passport, etc.) <br />2. A copy of a utility bill or other proof of residence, displaying your current residential address. (Must have been issued within the last 3 months, bank statements are not valid).<br /><br />how do i &quot;deposit anonymously&quot; if i have a verified account? wouldn&#039;t the account be traced back to me?

				All getting your account verified does is increase your bitcoin and USD/EUR limits on withdrawals.<br /><br />you can still deposit and convert without having a verififed account.&nbsp; You can transfer out 400btc per day and 1k USD per day with unverified.
