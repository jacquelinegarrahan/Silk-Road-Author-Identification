				I&#039;ve been spending 2 hours trying to figure this one out. BitInstant only offers limited options :(. They do have some sort of bank transfer, but right now, it&#039;s broken.<br /><br />Then, MTGox sucks big-time. They don&#039;t take debit cards but instead have all sorts of funky options which require me to submit legal documents to them. I could, since I access it via the ClearNet, but I still don&#039;t like it. It takes too long.<br /><br />What are my options?<br /><br />And please, no shady websites where a bitcoin costs 15 dolars, such as bit-local and whatnot. Or am I asking for too much? :).

				I can. I also dislike mtgox. They block you when using tor and ask for ID and other stuff they shouldn&#039;t be asking for. <br /><br />Perhaps PM me if you want to know more. <br /><br />For people who give me a -1 karma everyday, fuck off, im not going to ignore rules of this forum.<br />

				dunno if you consider localbitcoins as shady but i made some good experience with it , despite its f2f deals. Seemed to me those people selling Btc <br />(at least the one i did buiseness with) havent a legal source of btc either... huge amounts going out but not much gets in ;)<br />I traded with him in a public place and was very nice and informative, told me things about security and best ways to secure your btc.<br />Look for someone with good ratings and no strange prices or strange amounts like up to 40 k or something, at best combined with otc.<br />Wont name the trader i did biz with but for example he accepted foreign currencies cash in mail and he earned my trust 400$ first time deal and all went smoothly.<br />Isnt the fastest way but for me the best and most anonymous way to get btc, dont have any other option without revealing my identity.<br />Obscure the trail of your coins btcfog easywallets and stuff do the job pretty good if you willing to give it some time.

				Hazegarden: localbitcoins, yes, I considered it shady. That&#039;s because the first time I entered on it I had an African IP (of all places!) and the prices were outrageous. But now I updated the search with a ZIP from a city near me and I found some guys who sell bitcoins at just ~20% more than the market value. That&#039;s acceptable given the advantage of not having to actually pay something online or via credit card. Thanks for insisting on it :D.
