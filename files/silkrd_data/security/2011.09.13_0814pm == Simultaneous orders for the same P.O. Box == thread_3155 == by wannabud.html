				If you make some simultaneous orders and have a trouble with one of them, this could flag the other ones?<br /><br />I&#039;m asking because I ordered a small amount of hash from Netherlands and I don&#039;t know if I have to wait the package arrive or if I can make another other right now from another country.

				You will either receive a LL (love letter), otherwise known as seizure letter, in most cases if the quantities are low.&nbsp; Sometimes you will not receive anything at all.&nbsp; If a seizure leads to other investigative operations, LEO would still have to assess and expend the money to surveil you, get warrants, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since this is a small order, much of the worry should be absent.&nbsp; It sounds to me like the quantity would not be worth pursuing and certainly not worth monitoring your mail for future deliveries. <br /><br />

				Our preference is to use many differant drop locations around the country. You could ask family and friends to receive mail for you. We don&#039;t like the idea of bombarding ONE location with heaps of contraband.

				Involve other people is a bad choice for the majority of cases.<br /><br />If you do it alone, you can deny everything, in case things don&#039;t go like you was hoping.<br /><br />If you involve other people, and the cups give some pressure and the guy can&#039;t get the mouth shut, he can tell on you.<br /><br />Furthermore, I don&#039;t have relatives in my city and my family don&#039;t know I use drugs.
