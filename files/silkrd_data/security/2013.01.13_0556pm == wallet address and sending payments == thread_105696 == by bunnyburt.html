				I had a problem with a deposit but SR support sorted it but they said to me to get a new wallet address. I have some left over coins in my account will they still be there even if i get a new address ? <br />Also how long should deposit to my SR wallet take ? Whenever i make one it seems to take 12 hours and this last one was almost 48 hours. I normally send them anonymously from blockchain. <br /><br />I was thinking about making a load of new wallets on block chain and send the coins to one of them from my depositing account then send them over to SR and maybe make a new SR wallet address each time i want to make a deposit. Would that be quicker then the anonymous method ? <br /><br />Thanks<br />BB&nbsp;

				They will still be there if you change your address.<br />My deposits usually take 1-2 hours, get a new address before a deposit don&#039;t let them get too old.<br />You can send all your coins anonymously to one wallet and send them from there all together to SR. If you use an online wallet for that access it through tor.

				Okay cool. Will definitely do all the stuff you said next time i do a deposit. Also at the moment I&#039;ve got open order&#039;s is it still okay to change wallet address or should i wait till those have been finalized ?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The address is just to receive bitcoins, right now your btc you ordered with are not in your possession and no they will not be affected. Get a new every time before you deposit and don&#039;t change it until the money are in.
