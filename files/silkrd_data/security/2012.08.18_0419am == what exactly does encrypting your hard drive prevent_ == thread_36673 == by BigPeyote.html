				Encrypting a hard drive prevents the data from being read without the password. Especially useful if police seize your hard drive.

				Another question: a quick google yielded this clearnet article:<br /><br />http://gizmodo.com/5878709/encrypting-your-hard-drive-no-longer-works-against-federal-prosecution<br /><br />What good is encryption if LE bastards can force you to grant them access?

				There is few solutions, but since I&#039;d guess windows is in use - go with http://www.truecrypt.org/ (clearweb alert)<br /><br />For starters, create some small partition(file container-&gt;standart, if you aren&#039;t sure), about 10-50 mb, hashes/encryptions would do by default.<br /><br />Mount it and play a bit to get a hang (move&nbsp; some files there, delete them .. you know)<br /><br />Wipe this toy partition, decide on size of new one, AES-Twofish-Serpent or Serpent-Twofish-AES for enc, RIPEMD-160 for hash.<br /><br />Oh, and to be completely serious about having safe storage - 16 or more characters for password, a&#039;s, A&#039;s, 1&#039;s and #&#039;s. (Small and big letters, numbers and characters)

				I personally think whole HDD encryption, or only accessing SR via a portable OS is a bit overkill, especially if youre just a buyer. I keep Tor, PGP, and all my SR/BTC-related materials in a TrueCrypt volume on a usb flash drive. IMO thats plenty good enough. If I was ever forced to enter the password for it, I would use the password for the dummy outer volume which contains Viagra-related documents, which I could claim I was embarrassed about so I kept them encrypted. <br /><br />But to each their own. Piling on further security measures is never a bad thing I suppose.
