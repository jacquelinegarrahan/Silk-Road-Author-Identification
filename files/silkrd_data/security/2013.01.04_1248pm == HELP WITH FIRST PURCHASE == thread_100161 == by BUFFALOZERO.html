				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent all morning trying to figure out how to encrypt my address when making a purchase, but despite reading as much as I can on the forum threads, I&#039;m really struggling.<br /><br />Can anyone help me, please?&nbsp; I&#039;m all good-to-go, but no conception of how to do this.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Check out GPG4USB, it&#039;s a very simple pgp program to use.

				You will need encryption software - Have you downloaded this yet?<br />e.g. PGP Desktop? GPG4win?

				pgp4usb is the easiest thing I have found, you might be up and running in 10 minutes or so.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link to a very good tutorial written by member named astor, it has screenshots:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />Good luck!

				1. Download GPG4Win from www.gnupg.org<br /><br />2. Install GPG4Win. As part of this installation you will get the &quot;GNU Privacy Assistant&quot; or &quot;GPA&quot; which is what you will use to encrypt and decrypt PGP messages.<br /><br />3. On SR, highlight and copy the seller&#039;s public PGP block (the whole thing that begins with &quot;------BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK&quot; and ends with &quot;-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&quot;)<br /><br />4. Open Windows Notepad and paste the copied PGP block, then save the text file (save it as any name you want - it doesn&#039;t matter).<br /><br />5. Open GPA and click on &quot;IMPORT&quot;, then locate the text file you saved the public key as, select it and hit enter. <br /><br />Voila! You&#039;ve just imported their public key! To encrypt something for that person:<br /><br />1. in the GPA program just click on Windows menu item, then Clipboard. This brings up a clipboard/text editor that you can type or paste your message text into.<br /><br />2. Once you&#039;ve got the message you want to encrypt, just press the &quot;ENCRYPT&quot; button, then select the person&#039;s public key (it will be listed by the name/email they used to create the key, which will probably be almost identical to their SR vendor name), then press &quot;OK&quot; and click &quot;YES&quot; when it asks you if you really want to use that key.<br /><br />Now the message in the clipboard is encrypted. Copy the encrypted text (all of it!) and paste it into the email or PM you want to send to that person. Only they will be able to decrypt and read the message.
