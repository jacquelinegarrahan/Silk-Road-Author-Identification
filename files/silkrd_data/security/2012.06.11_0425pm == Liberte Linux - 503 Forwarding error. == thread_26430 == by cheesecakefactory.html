				Hello everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m still learning with all this stuff and I could do with some help. I&#039;m using Liberte for any stuff that I don&#039;t want to be seen doing and all of a sudden I can&#039;t access silkroad or silkroad forums because everytime I try the midori browser brings up &#039;503 Forwarding failure&#039;, or just doesn&#039;t load. I would just wipe the Liberte off and start again but then I&#039;d lose my private key I think which would be irritating to have to start again. Does anyone know how to fix this?<br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />Cheesecakefactory.

				I do a ToR circuit reset and restart midori when I occasionally see the 503 privoxy error, it&#039;s never persisted long enough for me to troubleshoot properly. <br /><br />What happens if you try to access a clearnet site from midori?<br /><br />Also the latest version of Liberte includes Epiphany for a browser (no longer midori)<br /><br />

				I had the same problems... First it was due to my wifi, then i reset the router, then switched the tor identity andworked after a couple reloads. Hope you get it figured out.

				Yeah, I was getting those errors also, as well as the &quot;router password required&quot; popup all the time.&nbsp; <br />Turned off my wifi and plugged in a cat-5, and presto, no more 503 errors.<br /><br />Also, something that would be a good suggestion in general is, like 4903kmn1d said, recompile your version of Liberte to the newest one.<br /><br />Omega<br /><br />

				Something that works for me is to go to Preferences, then Network connections. Under the wireless tab delete all of the remembered connections, the reconnect to the wifi. Don&#039;t know why this works but it does.

				I had some weird shit happen in Liberte, suddenly the orange RSS feed view thing started showing up in the address bar (or upper right of it as a button) as if it was a news feed.&nbsp; Needless to say this bugged me out and I&#039;ve switched distros...any info on this?&nbsp; Also is it true that Liberte leaks DNS entries?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read lots of people&#039;s assertions that it does and therefore makes it unsafe but dont understand what that means in practicality and if the new switch from midori to the new browser addresses this.&nbsp; any input would be great fellas,thanks
