				&nbsp;Hello SilkRoad. I have been a member for a few months now. I am wanting to be as secure as possible. I&#039;ll admit I was very naive when I first came here. Didn&#039;t use tails, PGP, figuring I only buy personal amounts, and thought there was no need. I also did not think I would use the road often at all. I figured my first purchase of blotters would be the only prchase I made, but have now come to depend on the Road for my treats.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am fairly new to using the dark web, and cannot find out how to set up a tormail account. Could any please let me know where I have to go, and what,if any, steps I have to take to set up an account.<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks in advance<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Thank you so much Mandy. About a week ago I had signed up on a page that looked exactly like that, which I had found on the hidden wiki. But I was never able to log in after signing up. I guessing that was phishing site. Thanks again.&nbsp; :)
