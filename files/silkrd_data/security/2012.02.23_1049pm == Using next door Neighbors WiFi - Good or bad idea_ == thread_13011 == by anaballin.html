				So I figured it could add an extra layer to security if I used my neighbors WiFi to connect. He doesn&#039;t have<br />a password for it.<br /><br />Would this be a good or bad idea? Why?

				Probably not a good idea: http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/07/ardolffedssentencingmemo.pdf<br /><br />But the way he was caught wouldn&#039;t apply to Tor users so meh.

				...expected this was connecting to your neighbours wifi router directly from a laptop say -so yes ...spoof / change the default MAC address,,,wouldnt mess with your<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;router to their router...why change the MAC? -its evidence counting against you and if by chance they pair up your hardware with the neighbours logs = trouble..<br /><br />

				on OSX, i used to use MacDaddy a few laptops back until it stopped working, then i switched to ChangeMac which worked at the time, but now it wont work on my new macbook (it does say it wont work on Macbook Pro&#039;s at least), but now MacDaddy &quot;seems&quot; to be working again and claims to to be changing my MAC addy...<br /><br />but when i go into Terminal and enter: &quot;ifconfig en1 | grep ether&quot; (which is supposed to show your current MAC addy) it&#039;s still displaying my &quot;real&quot; MAC addy...<br /><br />should i believe MacDaddy or the terminal command?? i&#039;m guessing the Terminal, but from what i can tell, this might be the answer to the problem for anyone having problems running 10.5.6 or higher: http://osxdaily.com/2008/01/17/how-to-spoof-your-mac-address-in-mac-os-x/<br /><br />(but does anyone know of another prgrm for OSX to spoof one&#039;s MAC addy, to avoid using the command line every time i log in? it would be nice just to set it as a &quot;login item&quot; to start automatically.)<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Note: Reader Dee Brown points out the following, which may help with some users having difficulties: “running 10.5.6 you need to do the trick to disassociate from the network. ****DO NOT TURN AIRPORT OFF****. What you will have to do is click your airport and click join network and enter some bogus name as the network ssid. Then while it’s trying to connect click cancel.At this point you may spoof using the sudo ifconfig en1 ether command”<br /><br />other readers point out that Dee Brown’s trick works in 10.5.7 and above too. Thanks Dee!<br /><br />Update: If you’re still having problems with MAC address spoofing in Leopard or Snow Leopard, the above method still works but try disassociating with any wireless network BUT keep your wireless Airport on (as mentioned above) – an easy way to do this is to type the following in the command line:<br /><br />airport -z<br /><br />Note that you have to have the ‘airport’ command setup to work for users, you can do that by copy and pasting this command into the Mac Terminal:<br /><br />sudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport<br /><br />Once disassociated from the network you should be able to spoof your MAC address as usual.<br /><br /><br /><br />
