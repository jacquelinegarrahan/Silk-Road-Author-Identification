				In this thread I would like if we bring up and analyze likely threats to the security of SR and the participants engaging in the market here. Let&#039;s discuss the vulnerabilities that law enforcement will likely attempt to exploit and brainstorm and present ways to counter them. I will get the ball rolling.<br /><br />One thing that I enjoyed about OVDB is that sellers had trust status assigned to them and all of the trusted sellers had reputations on private forums to be concerned about. One of the most glaring vulnerabilities SR has is also one of its strengths: anyone can become a vendor and the price of becoming a vendor is relatively cheap as compared to the amount of customer intelligence that can be obtained. As DPR has no presence on the private scene, it will be difficult for him to implement such a system. Additionally, such a system indeed opens up further vulnerabilities: if the person who assigns trust becomes compromised then the trusted vendors will all eventually come to be compromised, at least all additional vendors. Additionally, Tarpaulin and Fairydae clearly show that trust is not perfect security measures, even when long standing difficultly obtained reputations are on the line. I do believe that this sort of system protects from federal infiltration more than it does from scammers. Still, it seems foolish for us to not take advantage of the long standing reputations and history of the private source scene, especially when several of the vendors here have some history and reputation on established private forums. Additionally, the feedback system here is seemingly easily gamed. Some additional system of trust and reputation should be implemented here. One idea is from Undrugged, a site some of you may remember. I believe a similar system is in place on SafeorScam. The system is simply a variant of a web of trust, where participants can cryptographically say how much they trust other participants. A great deal of care must be taken in assigning trust, because if you say that you highly trust a person who later turns out to be a federal agent or scammer, the amount of trust others have in you will be diminished. In fact, I believe that it may be worthwhile to pursue a software system that makes the management and visualization of WoT easy for participants here. This will possibly help us to identify organized scammer and law enforcement infiltration: after one such infiltration is identified we can be more suspicious of the &#039;nodes&#039; which have assigned trust to the infiltrators.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course the primary threat to customers is that their order will be intercepted and result in a CD or raid. We have long discussed the possibility of interception detection technology, and I am strongly of the opinion that obtaining an easily implemented open source design for such technology is something that should be viewed as a top priority. Perhaps we can find people on SR who have the required skills for such a thing and form a sub group dedicated to the implementation of this technology. When coupled with fake identification or other non-linkable boxes, interception detection technology can potentially remove the risks associated with package interceptions, this would be the single greatest increase possible for the security of SR customers. The entire process of designing this technology absolutely must be publicly viewable and real time. <br /><br />Another thing I see as a serious threat to security is mis/dis information. This is false information, either unintentionally or intentionally introduced, respectively, in an attempt to degrade the security of participants. Misinformation may come from participants who want to help but who are themselves not as knowledgeable about subjects as they think they are. I see this frequently, users give what they think is good advice but in reality is bad advice. I see this even more on some clearnet forums where even the administrators suggest that people stay away from Tor and instead use VPNs. They may say things like &quot;Tor exit nodes can spy on traffic, you should avoid Tor and use VPNs&quot;. This is not applicable here as Tor is essentially required to access SR (in between sites like tor-proxy aside), but is a good example of what could be either mis or dis information. In the cases where this is misinformation, it is largely due to lack of sophisticated security knowledge on the part of the person making the claim: chances are they have read some news article that discusses Tor exit nodes spying on traffic, and have jumped to the conclusion that Tor is not safe. Of course someone with appropriate security knowledge will recognize that VPNs are just as vulnerable to exit node spying as Tor is, making the suggestion at best being based on an incorrect comparison between Tor and VPN&#039;s. In the case of disinformation, it will be a federal agent making the claim, possibly even suggesting specific law enforcement agency owned VPN&#039;s that ought to be used in place of Tor. Unfortunately mis and disinformation tend to spread at exponential rates, a naive user who is presented with mis/disinformation will tend to take it at face value, and in an attempt to be helpful will propagate the mis/disinformation to other participants. Of course this can be devastating to the security of individuals and even to entire communities. <br /><br />I would like us all to think of ways to combat mis and disinformation here, but I will present a few suggestions. First it would perhaps be helpful if some users who are widely recognized as being security specialists are given special titles identifying them as such. More value should be given to information coming from them than information coming from people who have not been recognized in such ways. How we can safely and fairly identify such users is a matter that warrants further discussion. Also, in some cases even experts have differing opinions, we need to recognize this as well. Furthermore, it could be exceptionally dangerous if law enforcement manage to gain control of accounts that are titled in such a way that trust is assigned to them. <br /><br />Another potential way to counter mis and dis information is to expect that citations be included for any claims regarding security, at least where it is possible to provide citations. Additionally, perhaps threads should exist for security discussions where all substantial claims are required to have citations backing them.<br /><br />Another major attack vector is in the software suggested to users. Without any doubt law enforcement are going to be providing &quot;secured&quot; virtual machines that are actually backdoored. I suggest that the sale of virtual machine images and similar be banned on the silk road market: there is no need for these services as independent secured live operating systems already exist (see Liberte and Tails), and the the time and skill required to audit an entire live operating system is such that we can safely assume that none of the live operating systems offered for sale on the silk road marketplace will be audited. Software is another area that is ripe for exploitation, and although I have previously said that we should not ban the sale of software I now have changed my opinion. I believe that sales of software should be banned on the silk road marketplace, or that we must use a strict auditing process. I can clearly see a benefit to allowing users here to offer software that will assist in the security of vendors and customers, as well as generally make life easier. However the risk of law enforcement exploiting this by encouraging vendors to use restricted access backdoored software is far too great. Software made available through Silk Road absolutely must be open source, publicly available and audited. Preferably we could find how many of the users here are fluent in different programming languages, and create teams of people who audit software. The people creating software are not barred from making profit, nothing stops people from donating to their efforts. One could easily say that this is counter productive to the spirit of a free market, however the fact remains that software distribution is a major attack vector, and I believe that our security is more important than the right of a person to sell software here in a restricted fashion, indeed the model could not be worse than one in which the only people buying a product are the only ones incapable of properly auditing it. A million arguments can be given for keeping closed source or restricted access software available here: vendors could be using advanced security techniques to isolate said software (realistically, almost none of them will be), vendors could independently get the software audited themselves (realistically, none of them will), it is up to the buyer and their responsibility if they are successfully exploited through this attack vector (true enough, but if a vendor is exploited in such a way all of their customers are put at risk, as much as it goes against my beliefs regarding other things I truly believe that regulation for the good of the community is acceptable in this instance, there are far too many vendors who do not appreciate the risk of running unaudited software and far too many vendors who naively trust anyone who makes enough posts and seems friendly).&nbsp; Additionally, it does not violate the principles of a free market if DPR opts to restrict the sale of closed source and restricted access software: it is his marketplace and he is free to do with it as he pleases. <br /><br />I believe that a culture of paranoia is essential for the ongoing security of the silk road community. How we can instill such a culture is an open question. A great many of the participants here are naive not only to criminality (most having probably never participated in an organized crime enterprise before, or having had many run ins with authorities), but also to technical security. Particularly it is important for DPR to have mistrust of everyone. I believe that if he places trust in others, that eventually he will trust a malicious party who could do damage to the silk road community. In the past I have seen him engage in activities that strike me as being somewhat naive, offering positions of technical privilege in the form of job offerings (in fact even I was offered such a position fairly early on, based off seemingly nothing other than my apparent skill with server hardening). It is in the best interests of DPR and SR to consider that everyone participating on SR is a federal agent. On the other hand it is also clear that he will need assistance with securing and maintaining silk road. I strongly suggest that he creates a thread for brainstorming and technical assistance in regards to SR, and asks for any help in that thread, to be thoroughly analyzed by the larger community and implemented by him and him alone. every additional person with privileged access to or information regarding the SR server is an additional attack surface for law enforcement to target, every job opening that offers access to privilege or information is a potential opening for federal law enforcement infiltration. He will be wise to recognize this, and to assume that all participants here are interested in deanonymizing him and compromising SR.<br /><br />Public sites are important, centralization is bad, compartmentalization is key. Nobody can doubt the role of a large public site such as SR. SR has single handedly transformed the online drug dealing community from a comparatively small community to a mainstream phenomenon. Indeed this is a key event, somewhat of a tipping point if you will, and in fact in line with the Netwar theory of such groups: that they will start small and eventually grow to the point that they spiral out into the mainstream. We should always have a public marketplace. That said, having a single point of failure is bad. In fact there are an abundance of private forums and the world of online drug trading will not go away if SR falls. However, I believe it is important for people here to branch off into private forums with restricted membership. There are several advantages to this. For one, it will help keep communication channels open in the event that SR is severely compromised. Even on tight knit private forums, an act such as being hacked or shut down can fragment membership and lose participants as communication ties that rely on the centralized node are cut. An additional benefit is that restricted membership forums inherently grow more resistant to scammers over time, if a private forum consisting of 600 participants on SR is created, as scammers start to be identified the ratio of scammer to legitimate accounts will grow in favor of legitimate accounts. On a public site such as SR, scammer accounts are a fully renewable resource. Even infiltration by law enforcement can be stymied by implementing restricted membership private forums: on SR mass registration of law enforcement accounts can go on indefinitely but on the hypothetical private forum, the ratio of legitimate to law enforcement accounts is unlikely to change much from what it initially is. Additionally, if small groups from SR splinter off into private communities, there are techniques to reduce the damage of even multiple law enforcement infiltrations: requiring multiple people to vote on all new members and keeping records of who votes to grant membership can quickly identify topologies. The effectiveness of this may be limited unless law enforcement nodes can be identified. <br /><br />Additionally, communications technologies that inherently support compartmentalized and massively distributed group interactions are important. Thankfully a great deal of development time is currently being spent on such technology.<br /><br />Another thing I would like to mention is the role of intelligence in such an organization. The importance of this is frequently overlooked. It would be strongly beneficial if SR could rally hackers friendly to the cause to try and pwn law enforcement personnel, intercept their communications, identify the law enforcement accounts on SR, etc. All forms of intelligence gathering should be employed against our enemies as information is what wins wars. of course securing our own information is of utmost importance, addresses should be encrypted, hardened systems used, Tor used, great care taken in protecting our shipments from being flagged, etc. However, defensive security is only one half of the battle, and it is equally important for us to gain as much intelligence on law enforcement as we possibly can. <br /><br />The strength of a public site like SR is certainly in its community. Utilizing the community to its full potential is important, and this importance is reflected in several of the other things I have discussed in this thread.<br /><br />Another thing we must always be careful about is becoming complacent. We must always remember that we are engaging in illegal activity, and that it is the job of law enforcement to hunt us down and imprison us (of course it being their job does not excuse them from responsibility, and they should be harshly punished for their crimes against humanity). All too often I see people here who seem to have forgotten this. When I see posts from people wanting to use credit cards to pay for their drugs here, it makes me cringe. We should never let convenience out weigh security, and we should never forget that we do indeed need security as we are engaged in highly illegal behavior. This is not E-bay, do not be confused by the friendly nature of this implementation of drug trafficking into thinking it is anything other than drug trafficking. Don&#039;t be fooled by friendly posters, the federal agents are sometimes the ones you least expect.

				Fuck, can you condense that for me?<br />&quot;Every person is responsible for their own privacy and safety and in turn should pass that info and help onto others who may need it.

Right now, to be honest, we are more or less small fish. Sure, SR is somewhat of an innovation in terms of its size and the fact that it&#039;s an online drug ordering service, but to be honest it doesn&#039;t handle enough drug traffic and is decentralized enough not to be worth LE pursuing. But we start becoming involved in direct attacks against them, and that will change. It will be worth the effort to target and bring down. <br /><br />Basically what I&#039;m trying to say is that a offensive effort against LE would bring more attention upon SR than it would be worth in anything we might gain through the attack.<br />If you want to do something like that, please disconnect it from SR, at least in name.

Unless the customs officers can remove the device without triggering the photovoltaic cell, or they get better luck than winning the lottery, the idea is sound.

On a public forum where people can register infinite accounts, scammers have infinite ability to register new accounts and so do LE. On private forums with restricted access membership, when a scammer burns one account out they have a lot of trouble to get a new one. With LE if they get 10 accounts into the private forum they will have more trouble to get a thousand new ones than on a forum where they can merely register a thousand accounts, one for everyone in their department. The initial invitation is a tricky subject though. Historically we have brought people over from forums such as bluelight on the assumption that law enforcement had not massively nym flooded it. It might be a safe assumption that the older an account someone has related to drug trafficking, the less likely they are LE, simply on the assumption that at some point in time law enforcement will use automated systems to massively register nyms on open sites, and the ratio of LE to non LE will dramatically change after that point in time. it is a tricky problem indeed, and one that warrants close attention. Public forums are immensely popular and in fact I am all for them even in favor of private forums, but countering nym flooding attacks is a serious priority that is worthy of a great deal of consideration. Perhaps some web of trust will end up being the best way to manage this.

SR is an awesome experiment and I think that it is extremely important that you are not defeated by law enforcement, not only for your sake but for the sake of the future of the online source scene, something which you and this site are now very much the face of.

It may not be very hard for LE to reach in that they could easily obtain a presence, but it would restrict the number of participating accounts they could obtain. One of the biggest advantages I see in private forums is merely decentralization. If SR is taken off line right now it will be a tremendous set back and a lot of people will lose touch. If there are a hundred private forums to fall back on, SR still works great for the public market, but if it is compromised the overall damage done will be minimized and regrouping will be a quicker process. Don&#039;t take my posts to mean that I think SR should break apart into a bunch of private forums, I just think we need to address issues of nym flooding, redundancy, decentralization and add more cost to obtaining participating nodes (not necessarily financial cost either).&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and found that LE obtains a search warrant and searches the place of delivery for drugs.

The device would consist of a small amount of volatile memory which holds a PRNG seed. A PRNG seed is some initial entropy that deterministically influences the output of a pseudo random number generator. The device would also have an RFID tag capable of transmitting, battery powered RFID can transmit significant enough distances. The volatile memory is hooked to a photovoltaic (&#039;light sensing&#039;) cell. After making the package, you would put the device in it and then close it up. Then wirelessly activate the device and load a seed to it. Now when the package is opened light will enter it triggering the photovoltaic cell causing the seed to be wiped from the memory. This makes it impossible for LE to analyze the device to reset it to a non-compromised state. When the package arrives at a fake ID box, the recipient could use an RFID wand to scan for a pattern that they could know because they have shared knowledge of the seed. If they detect this signal, then light never hit the photovoltaic cell, if they do not then either there was a malfunction or an interception. Since they know there was an interception, they can just avoid going to the box store, and since the box is obtained with a fake ID it can not be linked back to them. <br /><br />There are more fine details that would need to be worked out, but that is it in a nutshell. it may even be possible to have it broadcast its interception status after some predetermined time delay, through the cellular network and to a burner phone. <br /><br />We have most of the theory figured out, now the trick is to translate that into a step by step list of instructions on how to create these devices with easily obtained materials, and perhaps to program an open source controller for it.

Use it as a suppliment, but definately vote on new member additions based on their rep (It is a tough vote to get started, and the only rep that most of you know is the rep from SR) but in time, you will be able to vote someone into membership who has more of a thumb on the pulse of these already existing private communities also. There is quite a bit of talk on the few (semi) private boards I frequent more about security of vendors, and news releases of issues surrounding our scene, because some of the members of these boards are deeper connected than your average joe, and they keep others informed, but don&#039;t blather on about inner workings here in the public. then the info trickles slowly down friend by friend until it is public knowledge. Without rambling too much, if you have folks you get along with regularly here on SR, build a forum for yourselves. IF your friends turn out to be LE, and not alot of action is done in public, they are likely to not stick around too long (I guess) because it seems like just water cooler chat. Then after your initial group feels comfortable with the others on the group, then votes can begin for new members.&nbsp; It is my personal vision that the public SR site should be where vendors make their bones (so to speak) by dealing with wide customer base, high order count, and lots of time spent each day keeping up, then they are able to graduate to a more private setting in a position of supplying others who want to build a long term rep for themselves, and another generation of dealers is born. The food chain moves up, and SR maintains the &quot;frontlines&quot; of higher scam rates and larger LE presence, while the ones who have built empires (3jane, few others that I am too out of it to name right now...btw, fried due to finding some left over molly from my ol&#039; gal Jane) back to point. once these vendors graduate to private forums, sourcing FOR the sr vendors, escrow is now insignificant for a number of reasons, but quite simply, a scammer rep on SR can be fabricated to a fixed point, and in the private sector, a single confirmed scam, and word gets around pretty quickly, and he doesn&#039;t have a week of orders that have to be moderated in dispute to finally figure out he went rogue. I know I got off the point here, but kmf is right about a few things here. Collectively, we put too many of our eggs in the same basket, and when that basket drops, where will we be without a network of likeminded forums, stores, off site contacts, whatever.<br /><br />BTW, if you want to start up your own forum for you and your friends, I have a surplus of FH invites, and can help you get started there if you want. I have already helped jameslink with his own shroom forum (haven&#039;t been on there in a bit), and another that I don&#039;t remember . Train of thought is derailing again, but I hope you get the point I am getting at.

				kmf,<br /><br />Thanks for your post, you&#039;ve brought up some great points.&nbsp; Regarding the hacking/spying aspect there are some serious barriers.&nbsp; &nbsp;As AS/Anon has shown it isn&#039;t that difficult to penetrate random local police but these are targets of opportunity and not pinpointed targets.&nbsp; The FBI and DEA departments that would be targeting SR (Non-Fed LE doesn&#039;t have the resources) are also the ones that would be the most hardened against hacking attempts.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like the FBI&#039;s cyber crime div is going to be open to a SQL injection and, while the UDID op may or may not have pwnd an FBI laptop, I don&#039;t know of that many black hats that are going to be willing to blow a good zero day (or multiple ones) in the hope that that they MIGHT pick up some intel.<br /><br />The irony here is that for us to go on offense against LE we face very similar challenges that LE has in coming after us.&nbsp; I think one of our best approaches would be to insert significant uncertainty into their equations.&nbsp; For example, creating a honey pot op whereby a SR cell slowly creates a vendor that deals in weight of H or blow and &quot;accidentally&quot; drops hints at their identity on various boards and various times so that LE can build a profile on them.&nbsp; While I hate to involve the innocent, if done right a patsy could be set up so that the mere act of targeting this &quot;big vendor&quot; creates PR or political blowback.&nbsp; An example here would be making a college age child of a senator or congressman look like they&#039;re moving serious weight through the road (though their not), letting LE do their constitution burning act, bust the innocent party and watch political hellfire and brimstone come down.&nbsp; This would certainly give any LE cold feet in coming after a vendor.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe even serious discussion of this would have the intended affect.<br /><br />As far as the private working group, a cell based approach could possibly work out well.&nbsp; Remember that LS/AS was a pretty successful offshoot of anon (and only got busted when Sabu didn&#039;t Tor two of his IRC log ins, not because of anything tech) and in forming it they faced similar obstacles as we do here.&nbsp; With that said, I believe that sunshine is a great disinfectant.<br /><br />Thanks again K!

So far we have only used defensive security, and I believe that is why we are still here.

Right now, to be honest, we are more or less small fish. Sure, SR is somewhat of an innovation in terms of its size and the fact that it&#039;s an online drug ordering service, but to be honest it doesn&#039;t handle enough drug traffic and is decentralized enough not to be worth LE pursuing. But we start becoming involved in direct attacks against them, and that will change. It will be worth the effort to target and bring down. <br /><br />Basically what I&#039;m trying to say is that a offensive effort against LE would bring more attention upon SR than it would be worth in anything we might gain through the attack.<br />If you want to do something like that, please disconnect it from SR, at least in name.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />We should be prepared at&nbsp; least for offensive action and we dont think any offensive action can be linked to SR as long as we do not leave &quot;pawned by SR Defense Militia&quot; gifs on their computers&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />But a lot of intel could be gathered on operations on the way ..new customs techniques and personal which is targeting us.<br /><br /><br />Cheers &amp; LONG LIVE THE ROAD!<br />

				I agree with the need for people who want to live free colaberating but when the SR becomes a locked down police state with a general utilitarian philosophy of &quot;We can&#039;t allow freedom of choice and association because the war with the cops is too important&quot; then it has become too much like what it rose up to circumvent for me to hang around.<br /><br />I&#039;m with you that smart people working together in counterintel puroposed groups is highly necessary, as is re-turning the slaves they buy with with threats of jail and promise of money to work against the spirit of freedom they started hacking for in the first place, but that is just it. The spirit IS the center. People come and go and it could be as much a liability as an asset if you have locked yourself into an overly ridgid shop. The strength of open source is the strength of volutarism. People, for whatever reason, see fit to act in concert as they are all at once looking at the same goal. The paranioa that comes from an imperfect system of trust is another great asset in disguise. It keeps you awake and flexilble. How would it be to have a great plan all hatched out and ready to implement only to find a key member is either a&nbsp; cop or gets sloppy and taken out right at the crucial moment?<br />Everyone on your team is a potential failing point and any critical mission will suffer from too much control over it, much like the security issues Apple has had to admit lately, that went unaddressed for how long, a week or more, while a patch was already available and ready to port. Open source is more than words, its a phenomenon.<br /><br />And I hate to be the one to say it but your quest for the whale, a noble quest and one that must be undertake because a whole lot more than a dope shop is at stake here, seems to have seperated you from the spirit of liberty. I can never let that go observed and unaddressed.<br /><br />So yes, lets figure out how to watch them watch us. Lets figure out how to bog them down in the weight of a top heavy org where everyone feeds on a diminishing slice of stolen property. Lets not hesitate to analyze the nature humans and systems of humans living in the reality of mortality and scarcity and use these tools to know where those bogs are and steer clear of them ourselves. Lets never pass up a chance to point out the way things are heading to one of the proles who think everthings doing fine because the TV said so and they still have bling money. The way that eventually you run out of other people&#039;s money and scraps of paper hold less appeal. The way a generation of young soldiers is weary of pointless ocupation of other people&#039;s land while knowing that this is the source of nearlly all animosity held for their kind by foreign people&#039;s. <br />Let us make the crucial connection in the minds of proles and estabishment consumers of ill gotton gains alike that the weariness of the fighting forces combined with the timing of playing out the last cards that taxation and money creation have in thier deck will lead to the promises made to those, those who hack for evil, bear arms against non violent persons for evil, push papers that weigh on the necks of and destroy the lives of people, will BE BROKEN SOON! They will not be able to fulfill their blood oaths and a loyalty built on sharing of spoils disintegrates quickly.<br />Let us NOT fail to get back as many into our graces who may see the error of their ways that the process of forgiveness can begin. Let us be the agents to point out the truth and to shine it out of our very asses in how we conduct ourselves in a spirit of freewill and cooperation, not by clamping down on the dope site in a reign of control like a Bolshevek spreading &quot;consent&quot; to his ambitions because a critical mass of free people will not join them of their own volition.<br /><br /><br />In summary, don&#039;t try to turn the dope site into a virtual police state and carry on with fight in any way that is voluntary and stokes the fires of liberty and open colaberation.<br /><br />They have huge economic problems bearing down fast on them and they know it. They are moving key pieces into a run at a checkmate as we speak.<br />But even then they lose. What happens to that precious spirit when it sells itself into bondage like the tax and inflation feeders have done and so many people have in so many ways from taking money to spy on people to just taking welfare of one kind or another? It stagnates. The enormous creative potential of humanity says &quot;Meh, I don&#039;t give a fuck anymore&quot;.<br />The quality of all things produced wanes, at first with a boost in quantity but then that wanes. The capital factors that once made men mighty upon the earth as they passed from generation to generation, built upon by each as they stood upon the shoulders of their fathers are then deconstructed, the hunger for knowledge that produced them slowly lost until the knowledge passes too. And mankind regresses into a primitive state not seen for ages, a state that with the lack of a complex indusrial economy does allow for what these assbags lust after, control of everything, but what will be left. Would you rather be poor in 21st century America or relatively wealthy in 10th century Europe?<br />Our impovershed are overweight and have the internet, I consider that a higher quality of life, one where we were almost to the point where wealth creation turned a critical knee on the curve and a land of truly plenty might have seen us mint a new coin by which to trade the fruits of our labor, the coin of high art in all it&#039;s possible forms.<br /><br />But nooooooooooo, a buch of power lusters have managed to convince a buch of envious fucks that producing wealth is evil and thier fellow man must BE CONTROLLED!<br /><br />Ah crap, another book. Oh well, maybe I can sign it someday. Now lets talk patents and how they are in their essence just one guy using the force of an armed gang to make a claim of yet unrealized income, thus preventing him from trying as hard as might if he had to have an idea every day AND setting the stage for large orgs, protected by state nepotism and guaranteed handsome profits by the same, come in and buy all of the &quot;cease and desist orders&quot; to the point where nearly all tools of surival become thier &quot;intelectual property&quot;. Check and mate. <br />But otherwise good people buy into this trap, hoping to be the one whos lottery comes in in a great idea or a few mediocre ones. They use thier machine of violence to create an injust avenue of exploitation, sell it as legitamate, because after all, it&#039;s the government and we all agreed,&nbsp; and then in the end consume their partners in crime along with everyone else.<br /><br />This is the spirit we don&#039;t want anything to do with. It is the spirit of death and those poor chumps laboring away for the benifit of thier machine and the spoils it promises to grant them need to be shown this before it is too late for them. That is how we win. By keeping our eye of the fleeting spirit of liberty, not falling for old tricks in new clothes that undermine it and teaching others to do the same.....voluntarily.<br />/rant

				I think assessment of threat have be related to assessment of one&#039;s vulnerabilities. <br /><br />One of such common vulnerabilities which is poorly understood is been vulnerable while you learning new things. in matter to succeed in any UG activities individual or organization have to have&nbsp; ability to learn. you need to learn to change effectively.<br /><br />if your adversary understand the way you learn, they can try to detect your learning efforts, anticipate the change resulted from learning, or even launch targeted attacks on a group’s “learning systems” which could degrade the group’s ability to adapt over time.
