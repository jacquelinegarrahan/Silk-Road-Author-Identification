				Same thing happened to me yesterday. I sent from my ewallet to SR wallet around 3 or 4 in the afternoon...and the transactions (I made two separate transactions) went through around 40 confirmations. They still weren&#039;t in my SR wallet around midnight when I checked for the last time. This morning, I checked the ewallet and my SR wallet again...the ewallet said they had been confirmed all the way through, but the SR wallet still didn&#039;t display any change in funds. Really not sure what is going on here, but I hope it&#039;s fixed soon!! I need the money soon as well! However, if it gives you any hope, another person on the forums was having the same problem yesterday but he eventually got his BTCs in his SR wallet. <br /><br />SR support hasn&#039;t responded to me either, but I&#039;m sure they have lots of emails to respond to. Especially if this BTC transfer fiasco has been happening to a lot of people in the last few days. <br /><br />Keep me posted if it gets worked out or if SR support responds!

				Oh, haha, thanks! That&#039;s a really kind offer&nbsp; :) It won&#039;t be necessary, though, plus I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll all be fixed soon. But it is really inconvenient and annoying&nbsp; :P ...especially when certain vendors sell out very quickly after putting up listings!<br />Good luck!

				Hey guys I was having problems yesterday also. I sent SR support a message but they didn&#039;t respond so they must be extremely busy with the issue. My funds took about 18 hours to come in. Make sure all your info was correct and just be patient. From what I have been reading on the forum the last two days, I&#039;ve only seen where one person hasn&#039;t received their funds in over a day. This one guy has been waiting since Tuesday but that&#039;s one person out of seven people I&#039;ve seen have problems.

				So I&#039;ve had this exact problem... I had 53 btc sent to my account from mtgox 20 hours ago,&nbsp; mailed support twice and no response. The longest I&#039;ve waited before this was 3 hours. I&#039;m so pissed about it, let me know if you guys hear anything from the administration soon.

				thanks for the sentiment amigo I appreciate that,&nbsp; I was however being a tad dramatic selling e and weed to free party people isnt exactly scarface but folks demand a reason you lost there money and violence is a common place thing when it comes to matters such as this plus reputation is everything as sr vendors know and mine is in question as we speak.

				I&#039;m pretty sure to give positive or negative karma, you have to be a junior member which means you have over 50 posts (someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong). It&#039;s really not based off of anything except another person&#039;s opinion of something you have posted. Anyone who is a junior member or above can give you +/- karma based off of any post of yours that they have read. From what I&#039;ve gained from my short time as a member here, there aren&#039;t solid credentials for karma, just personal opinion, so I usually don&#039;t base my judgement of another member off of their karma (unless it&#039;s overwhelmingly negative--I guess that speaks for something).

				Full member, 100 posts to give karma. kidcreole, welcome to the party. You&#039;ll find some people here who apparently live for giving bad karma, without any explanation or reason whatsoever.

This is the internet, people thrive off of negativity lol. I agree with you about the SR support sending out a mass message. That would stop some of the repeated threads about coins not coming. I know they see us talking about it, why not just kill it with a mass message. So far I love this site I just have this little problem with the the support team so far.

				Just thought I&#039;d say that I&#039;ve been waiting on my transfer from my instawallet to my SR wallet as well. Been holdin tight for about 18hours now, hopefully it&#039;s gonna come in soon! Kind of glad that this seems like a fairly standard issue though, especially as you guys have said that the transactions eventually took place.

				So I have made 3 small transfers of 10 5 and 3 no problem worked in 30 mins from external wallet to sc account so maybe next time before we put our bc in we check this forum and see if there is a issue and if so try doing lots of little transactions its a pain and will take a time but its better than waiting 2 days
