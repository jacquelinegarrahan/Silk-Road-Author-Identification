				What&#039;s up everyone.&nbsp; I just finished installing TAILS&nbsp; a few hours ago, and aside from the fact that the IceWeasel seems to be just a bit slower than your typical Browser Bundle install, Im pretty happy with it.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t expect to have all the extra programs that came with it though.&nbsp; Anybody ever have any security issues with the likes of:&nbsp; OpenOffice.org( and as a matter of fact, I tried to visit their website already a few times to see about downloading extra templates/add-ons but it&#039;s down everytime with a link to what seems to be a completely unrelated website - does openoffice.org even actually exist???);&nbsp; ClawsMail(is it worth using??); the OpenPGP app( just as good as Ming32 or any of the other versions?); i2p (the anonymous overlay network, what&#039;s that all about?);&nbsp; and finally the metadata anonymisation toolkit( how good is it - really?)&nbsp; <br /><br />Any feedback/advice for using any of these programs are much appreciated!&nbsp; Thank you so much, my broheims!

				Nah I haven&#039;t checked out Pidgin yet.&nbsp; More interested in these other apps that I listed in the post that could either possibly be tools of use to me, or be the death of my existense here on the SR before I start chattin.&nbsp; I spent quite a long time researching and asking questions on here when I first downloaded TOR and came to the SR, just to get all my chickens lined up, and this will be no different - its an absolute MUST that I have zero questions on how to properly use an operating system such as TAILS that Im not too familiar with, before I start playing:)&nbsp; I will get to it in a few days time though and Im sure I&#039;ll have more questions for ya:)
