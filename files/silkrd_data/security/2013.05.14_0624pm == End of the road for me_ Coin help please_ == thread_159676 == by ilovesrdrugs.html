				So, I have been using SR for about a year now, however over the past few months I have used it less and less. Partially because I stocked up &amp; experimented with everything i was interested in but also because Bit coins are more confusing than ever to me. <br /><br />Starting off I used BTCKing/Pal to help me fund my account, expensive but it worked.<br /><br />later on I found Blue Sky Traders &amp; all of a sudden they wont work with me because I am using Tor Mail.... they advertise on this site and expect their customers to use clearnet when they are advertising on tor...<br /><br />I check about a month ago and BTCKing / pal were &quot;off doing something else&quot; Now it seems the issue is a shortage of coin.<br /><br />I always figured Sugarmama would be there when I decided to start going via Money Packs but she seems to be gone as well.<br /><br />Anyways, I am finding it difficult to buy bitcoins with a way I find trustworthy. I am scared to use Bitinstant due to clearnet &amp; bitcoin fog is such a hassle. Is there another reliable vendor that deals with MP/Bank Transactions? Or any advice anyone can give me? Or are these all signs that I should wait until someone comes back and has coins?

				What&#039;s wrong with btc fog? Doesn&#039;t matter where you buy bitcoins from. Bitcoins themselves are untraceable. SR addresses are untraceable. And BTC fog makes them even more untraceable. <br /><br />What are the guys from where you buy the bitcoins gonna do? Report you to LE because you bought bitcoins? haha And then what? They can&#039;t see what you&#039;re doing with them. Plus, mtgox gets over 26 mil dollars a day from people wanting to invest and play the bitcoin market. Just go to btc-e.com and play there for a half an hour and see the amount of people on that chatbox over there, they are n00b players of the bitcoin market. <br /><br />Seriously, 80% of people who use bitcoins nowadays don&#039;t do any illegal things with them. And they buy their bitcoins on exchanges.<br /><br />What&#039;s this paranoia with you people not wanting to buy bitcoins using clearnet, jesus. I don&#039;t need to buy them because I mine them but I have sold so many bitcoins to so many people. What if one of those people whom I sold the bitcoins to happens to buy drugs with them? Will the police trace the bitcoins back to ME because I was the one who mined them? Just think about how silly this sounds. There are countless ways to get bitcoins, spend a while on www.bitcointalk.org and get accustomed to the people there. Hell, some people might even pay you bitcoins for doing services for them haha. It&#039;s virtually, incredibly fucking easy to get bitcoins. Just open your eyes and look around.<br /><br />There is no difference if you buy your bitcoins with your credit card or if you buy them anonymously.<br /><br />I transfer my btc&#039;s from mtgox (which has my bank account linked to it) directly to silkroad. What is LE going to do? They&#039;re going to SUCK MY DICK.<br /><br />I&#039;ll give you one example of deniability. I buy bitcoins from mtgox which has my bank account name and everything right?<br />I like to spend time on bitcoin forums.. One day I see a guy who is selling some cheap shit, like a VPS. He asks for 5 bitcoins to give me access to his VPS for 1 month. I buy the VPS from him and send him the bitcoins. BUT THE ADDRESS HE GIVES ME TO SEND HIM THE BITCOINS IS A SILKROAD ADDRESS!!!!!<br /><br />OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE?<br /><br />WILL THE POLICE ARREST ME NOW ? I DIDN&#039;T KNOW THAT.<br /><br />Now do you realize how stupid it is to go through all the trouble of btc fog and shit if you&#039;re only a normal drug buyer.<br /><br />If you sold tens of thousands of dollars of drugs every day I could understand the need for increased security measures regarding bitcoins. But like this? Gee!

				The message above is right on...<br /><br />And there is no need for you to not be able to understand BTC...and there is not a reason in the world you can not get btc easy.....and buying btc is 100% legal...and more importantly ...you have NOTHING to worry about..no one has gotten in any trouble EVER for buying btc then using it on Silk Road. And so you will not be the first.<br /><br />So go to bitinstant or something like that...buy your btc...and have it send RIGHT TO YOUR SILK ROAD ADDRESS!! SILK ROAD IS NOT ILLEGAL!<br /><br />Then buy your illegal drugs, send them to your real address and use your real name, use a trusted vendor and have NO WORRIES! You are doing something that has been done 100&#039;s of thousands of times...including you doing it many times! And honestly getting btc has never been easier!<br /><br />God luck

When I get over there I won&#039;t have access to my bank account, so a few weeks ago I decided it might be a good idea to sell some of my BTC for cash. I had done this a couple of times before and had a positive experience, so had no whims about doing it again.<br /><br />So I received a request from someone who wanted to buy 500euro worth of BTC in a f2f transaction. I drove down to meeting spot, met the guy, he gave me the 500euro and basically ran back to his car and drove off. I obviously found this strange, but it was an escrow tx, so I released escrow from my phone and went back to my car.<br /><br />On my drive back, I noticed that there was a Ford Mondeo behind me (the kind of car that is usually used by undercover police in my city). It seemed to be following me, I didn&#039;t have all my paperwork on my car in order,&nbsp; so I decided to take a detour down some local back-roads and shake it.<br /><br />So anyways, I lost the car, drove home and thought nothing of this strange encounter.<br /><br />Over the next few days, I noticed strange needle marks and tiny tears in all of my mail, I also noticed a really strange parked car outside my house one day, when I walked over to it to ask them what they were doing there, they drove off at speed. I probably should&#039;ve been suspicious then, but I had done nothing wrong and shrugged it off.<br /><br />A couple of days later, I wake up to the sound of my door being smashed in. I run down to find 5 police officers in my house. They showed me a search warrant under the misuse of drugs act. The national drugs unit were parked outside with sniffer dogs ready, they left after a few minutes though and didn&#039;t come inside with the dogs. The police told me the person I met on localbitcoins was an undercover police officer, and they had copied the registration number off of my car and got my address from it.<br /><br />They stripped the whole house down, turned everything upside down looking for drugs. They found 1 joint of weed and they also seized a clock which they thought was a digital scale (it wasn&#039;t) and informed me that they were going to prosecute me for intent to supply, even though I wasn&#039;t selling, and I showed them a prescription from a doctor in another country (that isn&#039;t valid here) and told them the superintendant of the local police station had informally told me that they wouldn&#039;t prosecute me for possession if it was medical use even though I was technically breaking the law. They also found padded envelopes and accused me of selling drugs through the post (a complete lie with no evidence).<br /><br />They then told me that if I didn&#039;t give them all the messages &amp; phone numbers of everyone I had met to sell BTC that they were going to seize all my bitcoin miners, computers etc and have them &quot;analyzed&quot;. I was about to move country in the next few days and didn&#039;t want the hassle of having to deal with this, so I told them that I had deleted all the messages (which I did) but that I would be able to get them back if they left my computers there, and that I would co-operate fully (I&#039;m obviously not going to co-operate). They then left and I changed my flight date and basically fled the country the next day, luckily I was planning on moving in a week anyways.<br /><br />So, a warning to you guys, be careful doing f2f transactions or buying/selling BTC in general, even though we&#039;re not breaking the law it doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t get unwanted attention from the police.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				What country was that in? <br />I don&#039;t think that flies over here unless they have something more than buying bitcoins on you. They might try to scare you, but if you know your rights and keep a relatively clean home you won&#039;t be getting convicted for shit.<br />Personal buyers aren&#039;t going to lose their freedom because the cops found 10 tabs of acid concluding a seedy search based on legal activity. <br /><br />Dealers and bulk buyers should of course be far more cautious, but again.. I for one don&#039;t keep shit at home, and if the cops do &quot;bust&quot; me they can kiss my ass. I know my rights, and I won&#039;t be leaned on with such bullshit evidence as bitcoin purchases..<br /><br />That being said, don&#039;t be stupid.. I for one won&#039;t be seen on localbitcoins.com lol&nbsp; ::)

When I get over there I won&#039;t have access to my bank account, so a few weeks ago I decided it might be a good idea to sell some of my BTC for cash. I had done this a couple of times before and had a positive experience, so had no whims about doing it again.<br /><br />So I received a request from someone who wanted to buy 500euro worth of BTC in a f2f transaction. I drove down to meeting spot, met the guy, he gave me the 500euro and basically ran back to his car and drove off. I obviously found this strange, but it was an escrow tx, so I released escrow from my phone and went back to my car.<br /><br />On my drive back, I noticed that there was a Ford Mondeo behind me (the kind of car that is usually used by undercover police in my city). It seemed to be following me, I didn&#039;t have all my paperwork on my car in order,&nbsp; so I decided to take a detour down some local back-roads and shake it.<br /><br />So anyways, I lost the car, drove home and thought nothing of this strange encounter.<br /><br />Over the next few days, I noticed strange needle marks and tiny tears in all of my mail, I also noticed a really strange parked car outside my house one day, when I walked over to it to ask them what they were doing there, they drove off at speed. I probably should&#039;ve been suspicious then, but I had done nothing wrong and shrugged it off.<br /><br />A couple of days later, I wake up to the sound of my door being smashed in. I run down to find 5 police officers in my house. They showed me a search warrant under the misuse of drugs act. The national drugs unit were parked outside with sniffer dogs ready, they left after a few minutes though and didn&#039;t come inside with the dogs. The police told me the person I met on localbitcoins was an undercover police officer, and they had copied the registration number off of my car and got my address from it.<br /><br />They stripped the whole house down, turned everything upside down looking for drugs. They found 1 joint of weed and they also seized a clock which they thought was a digital scale (it wasn&#039;t) and informed me that they were going to prosecute me for intent to supply, even though I wasn&#039;t selling, and I showed them a prescription from a doctor in another country (that isn&#039;t valid here) and told them the superintendant of the local police station had informally told me that they wouldn&#039;t prosecute me for possession if it was medical use even though I was technically breaking the law. They also found padded envelopes and accused me of selling drugs through the post (a complete lie with no evidence).<br /><br />They then told me that if I didn&#039;t give them all the messages &amp; phone numbers of everyone I had met to sell BTC that they were going to seize all my bitcoin miners, computers etc and have them &quot;analyzed&quot;. I was about to move country in the next few days and didn&#039;t want the hassle of having to deal with this, so I told them that I had deleted all the messages (which I did) but that I would be able to get them back if they left my computers there, and that I would co-operate fully (I&#039;m obviously not going to co-operate). They then left and I changed my flight date and basically fled the country the next day, luckily I was planning on moving in a week anyways.<br /><br />So, a warning to you guys, be careful doing f2f transactions or buying/selling BTC in general, even though we&#039;re not breaking the law it doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t get unwanted attention from the police.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />All the more reason to buy BTC online thru an exchange.

He asks for 5 bitcoins to give me access to his VPS for 1 month. I buy the VPS from him and send him the bitcoins. BUT THE ADDRESS HE GIVES ME TO SEND HIM THE BITCOINS IS A SILKROAD ADDRESS!!!!!<br /><br />OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE?<br /><br />WILL THE POLICE ARREST ME NOW ? I DIDN&#039;T KNOW THAT.<br /><br />Now do you realize how stupid it is to go through all the trouble of btc fog and shit if you&#039;re only a normal drug buyer.<br /><br />If you sold tens of thousands of dollars of drugs every day I could understand the need for increased security measures regarding bitcoins. But like this? Gee!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=174918.20<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So, as a few of you guys know, I&#039;m moving to another country soon enough. When I get over there I won&#039;t have access to my bank account, so a few weeks ago I decided it might be a good idea to sell some of my BTC for cash. I had done this a couple of times before and had a positive experience, so had no whims about doing it again.<br /><br />So I received a request from someone who wanted to buy 500euro worth of BTC in a f2f transaction. I drove down to meeting spot, met the guy, he gave me the 500euro and basically ran back to his car and drove off. I obviously found this strange, but it was an escrow tx, so I released escrow from my phone and went back to my car.<br /><br />On my drive back, I noticed that there was a Ford Mondeo behind me (the kind of car that is usually used by undercover police in my city). It seemed to be following me, I didn&#039;t have all my paperwork on my car in order,&nbsp; so I decided to take a detour down some local back-roads and shake it.<br /><br />So anyways, I lost the car, drove home and thought nothing of this strange encounter.<br /><br />Over the next few days, I noticed strange needle marks and tiny tears in all of my mail, I also noticed a really strange parked car outside my house one day, when I walked over to it to ask them what they were doing there, they drove off at speed. I probably should&#039;ve been suspicious then, but I had done nothing wrong and shrugged it off.<br /><br />A couple of days later, I wake up to the sound of my door being smashed in. I run down to find 5 police officers in my house. They showed me a search warrant under the misuse of drugs act. The national drugs unit were parked outside with sniffer dogs ready, they left after a few minutes though and didn&#039;t come inside with the dogs. The police told me the person I met on localbitcoins was an undercover police officer, and they had copied the registration number off of my car and got my address from it.<br /><br />They stripped the whole house down, turned everything upside down looking for drugs. They found 1 joint of weed and they also seized a clock which they thought was a digital scale (it wasn&#039;t) and informed me that they were going to prosecute me for intent to supply, even though I wasn&#039;t selling, and I showed them a prescription from a doctor in another country (that isn&#039;t valid here) and told them the superintendant of the local police station had informally told me that they wouldn&#039;t prosecute me for possession if it was medical use even though I was technically breaking the law. They also found padded envelopes and accused me of selling drugs through the post (a complete lie with no evidence).<br /><br />They then told me that if I didn&#039;t give them all the messages &amp; phone numbers of everyone I had met to sell BTC that they were going to seize all my bitcoin miners, computers etc and have them &quot;analyzed&quot;. I was about to move country in the next few days and didn&#039;t want the hassle of having to deal with this, so I told them that I had deleted all the messages (which I did) but that I would be able to get them back if they left my computers there, and that I would co-operate fully (I&#039;m obviously not going to co-operate). They then left and I changed my flight date and basically fled the country the next day, luckily I was planning on moving in a week anyways.<br /><br />So, a warning to you guys, be careful doing f2f transactions or buying/selling BTC in general, even though we&#039;re not breaking the law it doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t get unwanted attention from the police.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I never said anything about face2face transactions.<br /><br />Getting robbed is my main concern when selling bitcoins face 2 face.<br />I&#039;d rather sell them on a forum using an escrow.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t apply to anything that I said.

				i&#039;ve been doing dwolla -&gt; mtgox with a verified account and have never been the least bit concerned for the same reasons NotaCop is outlining.&nbsp; and actually, most of my transactions have just been buying and selling right on mtgox to make some extra money.&nbsp; if a little bit of that gets sent to an address, what&#039;s the big deal?&nbsp; I was just paying someone for something and thats the address they gave me.&nbsp; i&#039;ll let my lawyer figure out how to word that story in the best way, if it really came down to that.<br /><br />but anyway, now i&#039;m SOL with getting bitcoins.&nbsp; and there&#039;s no fucking way i&#039;m ever using bitinstant again.<br /><br />does anyone know anything about OKpay?&nbsp; are they alright?&nbsp; i see i can use them to fund mtgox or btc-e, but i haven&#039;t really looked into setting it up.<br /><br />also, whats the deal with Liberty Reserve?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been hearing this name tossed around for years but don&#039;t know any pros/cons with setting up an account and using it to buy BTC.<br /><br />any advice would be greatly appreciated

Doesn&#039;t matter where you buy bitcoins from. Bitcoins themselves are untraceable. SR addresses are untraceable.

They can&#039;t see what you&#039;re doing with them. Plus, mtgox gets over 26 mil dollars a day from people wanting to invest and play the bitcoin market. Just go to btc-e.com and play there for a half an hour and see the amount of people on that chatbox over there, they are n00b players of the bitcoin market. <br /><br />Seriously, 80% of people who use bitcoins nowadays don&#039;t do any illegal things with them. And they buy their bitcoins on exchanges.<br /><br />What&#039;s this paranoia with you people not wanting to buy bitcoins using clearnet, jesus. I don&#039;t need to buy them because I mine them but I have sold so many bitcoins to so many people. What if one of those people whom I sold the bitcoins to happens to buy drugs with them? Will the police trace the bitcoins back to ME because I was the one who mined them? Just think about how silly this sounds. There are countless ways to get bitcoins, spend a while on www.bitcointalk.org and get accustomed to the people there. Hell, some people might even pay you bitcoins for doing services for them haha. It&#039;s virtually, incredibly fucking easy to get bitcoins. Just open your eyes and look around.<br /><br />There is no difference if you buy your bitcoins with your credit card or if you buy them anonymously.<br /><br />I transfer my btc&#039;s from mtgox (which has my bank account linked to it) directly to silkroad.
