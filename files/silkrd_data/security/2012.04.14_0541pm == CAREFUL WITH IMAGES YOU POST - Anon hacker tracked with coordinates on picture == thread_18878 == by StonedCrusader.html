				This has been posted about before, but I don&#039;t feel everyone on here is fully knowledgeable about it. <br /><br /><br />An Anonymous hacker was recently busted by the FBI because he posted a picture that he took with his iPhone and the picture had GPS coordinates attached to it.<br /><br />http://anonymouslegionops.blogspot.com/2012/04/explicit-photo-of-girlfriend-lands.html<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s more information about cameras storing information on pictures.<br />https://www.familysearch.org/techtips/2011/03/gps-image-tagging-iptc-exif-meta-tags<br /><br />Tips for cleaning data off photos:<br />http://mobileactive.org/howtos/safer-photos-how-remove-location-information-mobile-images<br /><br />This is especially crucial because most High-Res Cameras(the ones people use to take beautiful hi-res pictures of their bud namely), stores tags on their photos.<br /><br />If you are a vendor, you NEED to research on scrubbing the tags off your digital photos files before you upload them. If you have not done this yet, and have pictures of your product on here, then take the pictures down immediately and reupload scrubbed pictures.

				most linux distro&#039;s have a package called exiftool that can be installed via the package management software.&nbsp; This works on a lot of popular distros:<br /><br />sudo apt-get install exiftool <br /><br />then to clear all exif data from your images:<br /><br />exiftool -exif:all= /path/to/files*.jpg<br /><br />

				Good info to bring up!<br /><br />Can SR get something in place to auto-scrub all photos??? <br /><br />Is this making things too easy for non savvy vendors? <br /><br />It seems fairly absurd that any so called &quot;hacker&quot; would fail to realize such an issue regarding info on his iphone taken pic. Especially when he was taunting LE. Just having a pic of a well tatted chic, that could easily be matched is plenty enough I imagine.

				This program is great for anyone that wants to scrub their photos: www.steelbytes.com/?mid=30<br /><br />If you ever take a picture of your products make sure to blur out everything in the photo except your product, I&#039;ve read articles of people getting caught by leaving clues in their photos for LE to trace.

				GUYS. IT&#039;S NOT JUST IPHONES YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT<br /><br />ALL HD Cameras store data about the photo. The type of camera, etc.<br /><br />Example: A cop gets a photo, looks at the tag data. Now he potentially has the following information:<br />Camera Make &amp; Model - This can be looked up in a database, and if they already suspect you, and you&#039;re a camera owner of a illegal picture that was taken with said camera, you&#039;re fucked. <br />Your Name - A lot of high quality cameras will require you to register your personal information with the camera software - this can also go on the photo.<br /><br />Etc, the list goes on. If you&#039;re going to post any photos of ANY KIND. Expect all cameras to carry vital personal information on them that could give you away, if if they don&#039;t... it&#039;s part of safe practices.

				wattup wattup!<br /><br />So I was reading this or another thread and found the super simple &quot;stripper&quot; program? Where you simply drag your pic into the small box/window that is the actual program?<br /><br />Sorry, newb question, but say you take a cell pic, email or usb copy it to computer, then drag it into stripper... is it then ready to be uploaded? Or do you copy the data that pops up in the window after dragging pic and paste and save in another folder? <br /><br />Just need some clarification. <br /><br />

If you have not done this yet, and have pictures of your product on here, then take the pictures down immediately and reupload scrubbed pictures.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I spent $400 on a high res camera from Sony that does not have GPS or locating capabilities. This is how I avoid my location being in pictures I take.
