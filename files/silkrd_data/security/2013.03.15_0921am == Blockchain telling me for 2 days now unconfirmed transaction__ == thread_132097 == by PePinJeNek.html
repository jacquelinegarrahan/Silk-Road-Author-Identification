				So where were you sending the bitcoin from?&nbsp; What wallet were you using, or what service?&nbsp; If you&#039;re trying to deposit to your SR wallet from another non-SR wallet and it is showing the transaction as unconfirmed, that is an issue with the originating wallet / transaction ... not the SR wallet.

When you don&#039;t include it, there&#039;s no telling how long before will get confirmed. Confirmations require that one of the bitcoin network computers cryptographically verify a transaction against the entire ever-growing blockchain, and any transactions where the sender didn&#039;t include a fee will have zero priority.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no way to &quot;cancel&quot; a bitcoin transaction. You&#039;re stuck waiting.

				Probably had something to do with the blockchain fork.<br /><br />for a little while last week there were two different blockchains progressing in two different directions. Your transaction probably got caught up on the wrong one
