				I am on a secure computer and had just received my BTC to my wallet.&nbsp; I sent them to silkroad and nothing has shown up yet.&nbsp; The transactions have been confirmed, so I don&#039;t understand. I have made several transactions and never had any issues.&nbsp; Should I wait and see if they show up or could someone have possibly stole them?

				So it might just be a technical issue with SR.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t want to lose my BTC or have them stolen.&nbsp; These transactions I placed about an hour ago.&nbsp; So I am going to give it time and see.&nbsp; Also the dollar value of BTC on the SR checkout&nbsp; has been fluctuating a bunch&nbsp; (like from when I send a message and two minutes later it is at a higher rate)

				I&#039;m having problems as well, and for a lot longer. I sent the first BTC on July 26th, and the 2nd was sent yesterday. Neither has arrived. I was given a message a few weeks ago that my old address for deposit was being retired, and i had a new one.

				Just to alay some fears, i&#039;ll relay on what DPR told me when this happened to me recently. Hope he not mind.<br /><br />Bout a week or two back i a transferred some bitcoins to SR, but 7 hrs later they still no show (it was only a small amount of BTC, but still i was concerned, this had never happened before).<br />I followed it with block explorer and it seemed to go as per normal, eg. was transfered to my SR address, then transfered on to other addressess for tumbling (jumble about with others SR deposits so not easliy linked back, a service SR does for us).<br />After about 12 hrs i messaged SR support and was told wait 72 hrs and if they still not there then message them back with btc address.<br />72 hours later still no show so i message&nbsp; with address and blockexplorer transaction link.<br />They message me back saying all fixed, and i see that and admin has manually deposited the right amount of lost BTC to my SR account.<br />So all ws good but i was still somewhat worried as to why it happend&nbsp; So I inquired as to why this had happened and DPR himself told me that is bug had cropped up after an update to their payment processor. And it had effected a very few other people. They think they got it fixed now.<br /><br />I have not had it happen to me since (i generated new SR deposit address just incase also).<br /><br />So i hope that it is just a bug that has cropped up after an update that they havn&#039;t quite fixed yet.<br />The alternatives (thoughts of SR being compromised for example). are scary

				My successful payment into my 1st address went thru in 2 minutes, yet is is still going up in confirmations (56 now).<br />Yet the transfer a minute later from my 1st address to my SR address, is on hold but also going up in confirmations (48).<br />I dont know how this shit works, but are they playing with our money, selling it on for a fee, buying back, selling again?<br />I never found out how to take a screen shot, Im going to take some from the blockchain page.<br />So, guys, dumbass question here, how do I take/save a screen shot.<br />If you want to check your progress, put your BTC address into the searchbox down the righthand side at&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/<br />I know a lot of us know this but it seems a few newbies are confused and worried.<br />Im a newbie, still learning myself, Im worried, but ive read on a forum or two for BTC, you just wait it out, soetimes<br />it takes a day or so, especially for low priority transfers. I suppose , smalller&nbsp; ones take longer, though that aint a rule of thumb.<br />

				Same thing here. I sent quiet an amount Bitcoins from my wallet to my account here in SR. Wait for more than 20 hours now for the deposit I made last night. My Bitcoin client shows that its confirmed 148 times already. Nothing. In the past it worked within less than an hour. <br />I contacted support, but as others mentioned here before, no response.<br /><br />Will keep you updated here.<br /><br />Anyone who reported this problem here in this thread did get the issue solved already or at least a reaction from the support team?

				UPDATE:<br /><br />12 hours after my request for help to the support team they sent me an answer. &quot;sorry for the delay, your account has been credited :)&quot; and my money was on my account. No further reason for the delay was given. However, I am satisfied and and at least my issue is solved and I could place my order for some nice stuff.... ;)<br /><br />Any news from you other guys? Does somebody know more about the &quot;why&quot; it comes to these delays?

				My understanding is that this happens once or twice a year.&nbsp; Not sure why.&nbsp; But I believe that everyone ends up getting their money.&nbsp; I think it has to do with their system of &quot;Cleaning&quot; the Bitcoins prior to entering your account.

				Same problem over here and also solved. I waited nearly 20 Hours for my BTC&#039;s to show up in my SR-Wallet. After reading this thread and not being able to log in (always got an error) I decided to contact the SR-Support. They asked me for my BTC receiving address, but before I could answer them I had my BTCs in my wallet. So it took between 30 and 36 hours for my BTC to show up. <br /><br />I was a bit alarmed because I deposited some more BTC&#039;s 2 hours earlier and they showed up after a normal time of waiting. But now, money in the bank, ordered what I wanted, everything perfect and back to normal&nbsp; :)
