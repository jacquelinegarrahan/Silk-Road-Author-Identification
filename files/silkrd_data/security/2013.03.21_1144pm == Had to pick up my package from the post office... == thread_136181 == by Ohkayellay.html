				I haven&#039;t opened it yet. I don&#039;t know if that makes a difference. It&#039;s been a couple of hours. <br /><br />From the look of the peach slip it seemed more like the mail man ignored the waiver of signature, which I read happens on occasion. <br /><br />How worried should I be? Should I be frantically cleaning house? Or chilling with my package open?

				If they were going to kick down your door, they wouldn&#039;t wait hours to do it and give you a chance to slip out the back or consume the drugs. They would storm your house within minutes.<br /><br />If it&#039;s been a couple of hours, you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />Edit: In fact, if you picked it up at the post office, they wouldn&#039;t give you a chance to leave the parking lot.<br />

				I think you&#039;re probably ok at this point.&nbsp; But if you can hold off and are paranoid, why not put it somewhere safe and wait until tomorrow? Me? I don&#039;t have the patience to wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				Yes, you&#039;re fine. If anything was going to happen, you wouldn&#039;t have made it out of the post office parking lot.

				Thanks for the reassurance! I&#039;m still ok. I decided to clean just to feel secure. The most incriminating things are no longer recoverable. :D<br /><br />I&#039;ll wait until later to open the package. :)<br /><br />

				I think if they discovered it, they would have done a controlled delivery.

				The peach slip is DCN.&nbsp; all you have to do is go to usps.com/redelivery and schedule a redelivery. Then, leave the slip signed and taped to your door
