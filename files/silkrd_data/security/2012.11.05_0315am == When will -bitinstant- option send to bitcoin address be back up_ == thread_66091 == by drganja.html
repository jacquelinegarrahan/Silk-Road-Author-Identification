				I messaged their support and they said it should be up by the second. it is now the 4th with no luck. I am terrible with technoligy so this was really the only option for me. And i refuse to pay 20% fees from buying bitcoins from SR traders and having a high possibility of getting scammed... so does anyone know? or does anyone know of any other easy/similar options ?<br />
