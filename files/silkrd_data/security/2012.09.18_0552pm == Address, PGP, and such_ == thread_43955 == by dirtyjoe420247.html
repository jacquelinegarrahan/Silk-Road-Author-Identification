				Okay, so a friend and I set up a SR account, bought bitcoins and sent them to the SR account. We are getting 2 OZ of weed (trim actually) and I think a 1/2 OZ of shrooms. He said he is willing to ship it to his house. Is this a safety risk to him (we live in a small town, idk if that means anything)? Also, when I put his address in the little address box thingy when about to check out, does that have to be encrypted with PGP? I do not know too much about PGP and the reading I&#039;ve done has only thoroughly confused me.<br />I&#039;m sorry if these are dumb questions or have been answered before (I looked through several pages, but it was too tedious to continue :p ).<br /><br />Recap: Safe to ship to friend&#039;s actual house? Is PGP necessary when giving address?<br /><br />Thanks in advanced!

				It is much safer to send sensitive information using PGP most good vendors use it and it is worth learning... unless you think it is just your friends house who cares&nbsp; :)

				It is much much more reliable to send to a real address with a real name.&nbsp; The package will be less scrutinized and less likely to be lost.&nbsp; The flip side is that if it is discovered (weed is a little stinky, after all) and your real name and address are on it, you could get a controlled delivery.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t ever sign for anything.<br /><br />As WSG said, PGP does add security and it is probably worth learning eventually.&nbsp; You can always use privnote.com in the meantime.&nbsp; Pine (she is a forum user) has a thread that explains PGP pretty well.&nbsp; Search her name.<br /><br />Good luck with your first purchase!!

				^ what they said.&nbsp; it&#039;s always best to use a real name and real address -- if you don&#039;t and something happens to the package, you won&#039;t have as much recourse with the vendor as far as getting a refund or reshipment.<br /><br />as for PGP - definitely learn to use it.&nbsp; it won&#039;t take long to do so, and there are many, many threads that can help you get up and running with it.&nbsp; there are a lot of vendors who require that you use PGP to encrypt your address during the order process.&nbsp; it&#039;s just safer that way!<br /><br />good luck and be safe! :)<br /><br />** as for privnotes -- i&#039;ve noticed several vendors state on their vendor profiles that they will NOT accept privnote because it&#039;s not as safe as using PGP.
