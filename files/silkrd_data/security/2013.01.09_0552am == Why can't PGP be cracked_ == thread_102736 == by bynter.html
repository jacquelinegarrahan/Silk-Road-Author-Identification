				In my Computer Science class, I recently learned how encryption works.

				Yes, it would. 512 bit keys can already be cracked, which is why it&#039;s mind-boggling stupid that some PGP programs use that as a default key size. 1024 bit keys will probably be cracked in the next 5 years, so those aren&#039;t safe anymore either. That&#039;s why we recommend at least a 2048 bit key, but 4096 bit is better because it buys you even more time.<br /><br />So why don&#039;t we just use one million bit keys? Because it&#039;s computationally expensive to use them and that increases non-linearly with key size. Nobody wants to wait a few hours (or days or weeks) to encrypt a message. So there&#039;s a trade off: the level of security that we accept as convenient but still safe is usually something that can be broken in 20 years (instead of a million years), and we increase our security (in this case, key size) over time.

This key was generated by Tim C.May, one of the Cypherpunks, under the name &quot;BlackNet&quot;.&nbsp; BlackNet was a pseudonymous entity that offered payments for government secrets leaked to them.&nbsp; Information was leaked by posting it to Usenet, encrypted with BlackNet&#039;s PGP key. <br /><br />My understanding is that the largest RSA key broken to date is 768-bits, though I haven&#039;t looked at this in some time.&nbsp; Back in 2002, at the Financial Cryptography seminar, it was announced that a group was cracking 512-bit keys in a few weeks on spare hardware they had laying about the office. <br /><br />Within the last year or two, a 1024-bit Mersenne Prime was cracked by a team including Arjen Lenstra. Lenstra is famed for being a factoring guru. A Mersenne prime is a special case of a prime number, and due to its special features, it is easier to factor than any randomly-chosen prime of the same size.&nbsp; The last time Lenstra cracked such a prime it was 5-7 years afterward that general primes could be factored of an equivalent size. <br /><br />Given that this 1024-bit Mersenne prime break was about 1-2 years ago, it is expected that a randomly-chosen 1024-bit prime will be broken within the next 5 years or so. <br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />

It was about 12-15 years ago that Phil gave every PGP user a Christmas present, when the software switched-on a flag on December 25th, allowing the generation/use of 2047-bit keys. (They were supposed to be 2048, but there was a bug.) <br /><br />Since that keysize was enabled, anyone with even a lick of sense has been using 2048-bit keys. (I know I haven&#039;t used any key smaller than 2048-bits since then.)&nbsp; Additionally, anyone posting to Usenet should have used a layer of conventional encryption, if for no other reason than to frustrate traffic analysis. <br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />

				Here&#039;s a great article on just what these motherfuckers are up to:<br />&nbsp;<br />CLEARNET: http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/<br /><br />The elephant in the room here is where quantum computing goes in the next 10 years.&nbsp; Sounds like the 4096 bit keys we have now should at least last until the statute of limitations runs out.

All we can hope is that the code makers stay ahead of the code breakers, but even so it appears encryption will always have a expiration date.

These estimations are based on current knowledge of factoring, and assuming that Moore&#039;s law continues in effect.&nbsp; Naturally, breakthroughs can occur at any time, so these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=102736.msg713526#msg713526">Quote from: bynter on January 09, 2013, 08:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have a feeling once this NSA thing is completed, this site will see a lot more arrests.

It would be used against other governments, possibly against terror cells -- it is not likely to be used against individual drug users, especially small-time users. <br /><br />Look back at history.&nbsp; The British (with the help of the Poles) managed to obtain some German Enigma cipher machines. Thanks to the efforts of a dedicated group of people (including Alan Turing)&nbsp; the British managed to crack the Enigma. They were reading high-level German cipher traffic as soon as the German generals themselves got it.&nbsp; This was considered _so_ important, that knowledge of this was classified until the mid-1970s. <br /><br />Similarly, around 1970, Ellis &amp; Cocks, two cryptographers at GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA, developed what they called &quot;non-secret encryption.&quot;&nbsp; This was the first public-key cryptosystem.&nbsp; Several years later, Diffie, Hellman and Merkle independently struck upon the same concept, and published a paper, letting the cat out of the bag. Naturally, the British immediately classified Ellis and Cocks&#039; work, and nothing further came of it.&nbsp; Even when Diffie visited Ellis in Britain, the man remained mum about his discovery. The closest he came to even admitting it existed, was a comment he made to Diffie to the effect that, &quot;You did more with it then we ever did.&quot; <br /><br />So, even if any breakthroughs have been made, information from these will not be used to prosecute small time drug users, or even pedophiles. Secrecy is too important to let it be endangered by such uses. Furthermore, you have to understand that agency rivalry is a major factor here -- the Intelligence agencies don&#039;t trust each other -- the NSA doesn&#039;t trust the CIA, and neither the CIA nor the NSA trust the FBI, let alone the DEA. <br /><br />For their part, the NSA&#039;s prime directive, if you will, is to protect anyone from learning of their true capabilities. They&#039;re not going to be caught dead sharing information with other agencies that might shed light on their capabilities. <br /><br />Finally, there is both politics as well as economics to contend with. In the past 40 years, since Nixon began the War on Drugs, America has changed dramatically -- from being a creditor nation, to a debtor nation. America&#039;s manufacturing infrastructure is hollowed-out, and the middle class is in real danger of becoming extinct. I would argue that the Drug War is a war that America can no longer afford. We&#039;re already beginning to see the cracks in that political position, with two states legalizing marijuana. This is just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; It may take another generation (or even two) but eventually Americans will conclude that the Drug War is unsustainable.&nbsp; The true irony is that both the U.S. government and the drug cartels are on the same side -- both of them are terrified of legalization. If drugs were legalized, the cartel&#039;s profits would vanish in a puff of smoke. <br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />

				Not all encryption is actually based on public-key cryptography (asymmetric ciphers).&nbsp; There&#039;s symmetric ciphers (basically you share the private key and use it to both encrypt &amp; decrypt -- more &quot;symmetry&quot; in the process than public/private key pairs is how I remember it), and no doubt a bunch of stuff I don&#039;t even know about -- cryptography research isn&#039;t a trivial field of math/computer science, and I&#039;m not even going to pretend that I try to keep up with the literature.&nbsp; Amusingly enough, the only encryption system I know of that&#039;s actually provably as secure as randomly generating characters (meaning it&#039;s as hard to break as pure gibberish) is a one-time pad.&nbsp; It&#039;s not very practical though; you can look it up if you&#039;re curious.&nbsp; Other than that, nobody&#039;s proven that our encryption schemes are actually secure.&nbsp; Nobody knows of a way to break them (presumably not even the big governments), but there&#039;s no guarantee that tomorrow some genius won&#039;t discover a mathematical shortcut that allows factoring huge numbers in seconds (which would make all our public key cryptography useless).&nbsp; Quantum computing isn&#039;t the only issue.<br /><br />To answer your question though: basically brute forcing the encryption is much, much harder than finding a vulnerability in the surrounding software.&nbsp; Honestly I&#039;ve never worked with large-scale financial systems personally and don&#039;t know what schemes they typically use, but that&#039;s just how all software is these days: it&#039;s easier to get around the mathematical encryption than it is to go through it.

				AFAIK, PGP keys of any size have never been &quot;cracked&quot; but rather were attacked through &quot;brute-force&quot; by going through all possible combinations.

And remember this is the time for breaking any one particular message - any other messages encrypted with the same size key would also each require the same computational investment to decipher.&nbsp; And please note these numbers are approximations pulled out of my ass - I&#039;d Google it all, but Tor is too slow for that kind of research.<br /><br />Now the quantum computing bugaboo could render this all irrelevant, but it would also render the crypto used by governments and financial institutions irrelevant too. Fortunately quantum computing is 99% theoretical and the 1% that is actually achievable is essentially useless. QC has intractable problems related to decoherence and integrating input-output infrastructure which makes it nearly impossible to scale up to any useful applications. QC is mostly useful in investment scams and as disinfo to make people doubt their cryptographic security.<br /><br />Just my 2-bits&nbsp; ;)

				PGP can be cracked by an attacker with sufficient computing resources. Once you get to 4,096 + bit keys though it is not really feasible for someone to crack in our life times without having a quantum computer. Highly parallel traditional computers can mimic quantum computers, but the resources required to crack that strong of an RSA key with traditional computing power are extremely massive.

				You&#039;re absolutely right, it is linked to the specs of the computers involved.&nbsp; But frankly,&nbsp; I think you may be underestimating just how many calculations are involved here; the fact is computing power progresses at a shockingly predictable rate, and short of mathematical breakthroughs, the things stated here can be taken as reliable information (2048-bit keys being pretty secure for awhile, 4096-bit keys being secure for many years to come).<br /><br />If you actually get into computer science and analysis of algorithms, you don&#039;t stop and preface everything with &quot;all time estimates are using my home first generation Pentium, please read on...&quot; or something.&nbsp; You say it takes N calculations on average, or N calculations in the best case, or N in the worst case, or some other estimate that applies to a situation.&nbsp; It&#039;s up to the person who wants to get a feel for that number to translate that into a time frame on a given system; basically I&#039;m saying these are typical answers and they aren&#039;t really leaving details out so much as ignoring them because they&#039;re meaningless for the subject at hand.&nbsp; Besides... most people find this stuff dry enough as it is without starting to throw in algorithmic jargon.

				That makes sense as to why PGP keys are being cracked so much faster. If 88 bits is 25 times harder, then 512 bits is about 145 times harder, and that would take log2 145 = 7.2 doublings of computational power. Realistically the doubling rate is more like 18 months, so 7.2 * 1.5 = about 10 years, which is what we&#039;re observing.

				I remember the distributed.net days when they used tens of thousands of home computers to break 56 bit (symmetric) encryption, and that took a few years.

There is an enormous amount of disinfo out there that aims to reduce people&#039;s confidence in PGP security. The &quot;story&quot; whose headline loudly scream &quot;1024 bit key cracked in 100 hours&quot; is pure sensationalism and con-artist style hype. Look at the details, you&#039;ll see it was just an experimental side-channel attack on a server&#039;s OpenSSL key. No encryption was cracked at all.<br />http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~valeria/research/publications/DATE10RSA.pdf<br />The only way they were able to derive the key was by having physical access to the server and subjecting the HDD to carefully controlled electrical discharges during authentications. This produced faults in the OpenSSL signature generated by the server during authentication. Finally when they had obtained 10,000 of these corrupted SSL signatures they sorted through them to find the ones that only had a single bit fault on them (no mention at all about how long the experiment had been going on at this point). Then their computers went numbercrunching on the those signatures for 104 hours to produce the private key.<br /><br />Their experiment doesn&#039;t impress me and sure doesn&#039;t give me anything to worry about as far as PGP security goes. Besides the fact that it was a side channel attack that could only work under very controlled and limited circumstances, and also leaving aside the question of whether zapping someone&#039;s server while reauthenticating thousands of times (for god knows how long) is even remotely possible to do without them knowing something was up, it&#039;s important to point out that none of this affects the security of keys or message encryption/decryption.<br /><br />So no - a 1024 bit key has never been cracked, but it it could probably be done by someone who is either wealthy enough to buy a warehouse full of Cray supercomputers and patient enough to wait a few years, At this point the largest key that&#039;s been sucessfuly factored is 768 bits (RSA-768) back in 2009 by a team who worked on it for 3 years. RSA-1024 is estimated to be a thousand times more difficult to factor&nbsp; Crypto geeks do this kind of stuff for the challenge and prestige that comes from being first, but I think the time and resources needed to undertake a 1024 bit key pushes it far into the realm of diminishing returns. Something like 2048 bit keys, I doubt will ever be factored simply because the time, money, and effort is too great (who would set out to work on a problem that with current and reasonably foreseable technology would still require far more time than remains in your expected lifespan? There&#039;s a limit to how long the trend of &quot;Moore&#039;s Law&quot; can continue, and the chance that &quot;Quantum Computers&quot; will ever be developed into something useful is somewhere between slight and impossible. It&#039;s not inconceivable that there could be a way to drastically simplify prime factoring - and a discovery like that would change everything - but I don&#039;t see any reason to think something ike is at all likely to happen.<br /><br />Go ahead and have fun with PGP, just make sure to use key sizes of 2048 bit or larger and then rest easy that no ones going to crack the key. There&#039;s practically zero chance that the government would every make any effort to crack keys of that size - they know the time and resources required to do that make it a no-go. Nah, if they decide they want your key they&#039;d just do it the old fashioned way and crack you! That&#039;s the way those swine roll. Best to avoid their attention.

				So I checked with someone who knows crypto better than I do, and the answer is that technically the key space for an RSA key is the number of prime numbers that can be represented with less bits than the key strength, however practically it is the number of prime numbers that can be represented with one bit less than the key strength. So the key space for a 128 bit symmetric algorithm is 2^128 and the key space for a 128 bit RSA key is pretty much the number of 127 bit prime numbers.

				+1 that makes sense, and we would expect it to be much smaller than all the numbers represented by 127 bits.<br /><br />3 bits can represent 8 numbers, of which half are prime (2, 3, 5, 7).<br />4 bits can represent 16 numbers, of which 6 (37.5%) are prime.<br />8 bits can represent 256 numbers, of which 57 (22.2%) are prime.<br /><br />It is probably unknown how many primes are in 127 bits (1.7e38 numbers), but given the trend, it&#039;s a tiny percentage .

GPG is an OpenPGP compliant software tool that provides these algorithms. It is not in itself an encryption algorithm, rather it is a cryptosystem. GPG is called a hybrid cryptosystem because it uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric algorithms. There is actually quite a lot that goes into encrypting a message with GPG, although almost all of this is hidden from the user. First a pseudo random number generator is seeded with entropy from some sources (not sure exactly where, probably /dev/random on unix like machines and cryptgenrandom on windows) and outputs a pseudorandom string that is used as a session key. The session key is used in combination with a symmetric algorithm to symmetrically encrypt your communications, which are first compressed. Then the session key is asymmetrically encrypted with the public key of your correspondent. Upon receiving the message, your correspondent types in a passphrase in order to derive a symmetric key that is used for decrypting their stored private key, then their private key is used to asymmetrically decrypt the session key, which is then used in combination with the symmetric algorithm to decrypt your encrypted message. Then it is decompressed and the plaintext is made available. <br /><br />From a cryptographic point of view, the asymmetric encryption is the weakest link. From a practical point of view, your private key / the system you run GPG on is the weakest link.

Thus the key space is 2.6e26 times bigger for a 600 bit key, which doesn&#039;t explain why it&#039;s only 25 times harder to crack, per what kmf said earlier. In fact, 2.6e26 is 2^88, which is the same difference as if these were symmetric keys.<br /><br />There must be something more to it, because if 1% of the numbers are primes, then it would only be 100 times harder to brute force a 512 bit symmetric key compared to a 512 bit asymmetric key, and that&#039;s clearly not the case. The real difference is more like TENS of orders of magnitude.<br />

				There are campaigns against vendors that require FE. <br /><br />Should there be a campaign against vendors that are using weak PGP keys? <br /><br />Is there really any reason to use less than 4096 bits in today&#039;s SR world?<br /><br />I have come across a few vendors that are using very weak keys created online through igolder.com.

				No.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame that more people aren&#039;t aware of the ultimate facts pointed out in this thread, but to hold someone up to a standard &quot;just incase&quot; is a little bit...

				Come to think of it, I&#039;ve never seen your key, which begs the question, why do you hide it?<br /><br />You should at least create a &quot;public&quot; key separate from the one you use to make purchases, which you distribute on the forum.

				Not wanting to link identities is understandable. I keep a few separate identities myself. ;)<br /><br />As for the confusion between keys...<br /><br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you use PGP on Linux, but there&#039;s little room for confusion with command line gpg, especially in interactive mode. If you decrypt or verify, it selects the key for you. If you encrypt, it prompts you for the keys to use. The only source of confusion is during clear signing. For that...<br /><br />Open ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf and find the line that says default-key. Pick the key you use most often and put the key ID there.<br /><br />When you want to use the other one, use the --default-key argument.<br /><br />gpg --default-key &lt;my secret identity key&gt; --clear-sign<br />

Even in the rare event that they did, it&#039;d still be unlikely they&#039;d be able to connect the two pieces of information. Even if they did, they probably wouldn&#039;t even think anything of it. And even if they did, they would probably not be motivated enough to &quot;foil&quot; you and your accounts. Even in the rare event that all those criteria were met, you still wouldn&#039;t suffer a huge loss. I mean, I know it&#039;s a matter of taking risks and making assumptions, but that still isn&#039;t the type of thing I&#039;d lose sleep over. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And in a double feature post, I have some questions that are probably noobish(well, actually, only questions 1 &amp;4) and may not even belong in this thread(but hey, my thread, my rules![Yes, I&#039;m aware that&#039;s not how it works]). <br /><br />1: When we&#039;re creating our key, how do we choose how many bits it is? If we don&#039;t know that information when we create the key, how would we learn that info? Does it say somewhere in the .asc file? but again, more importantly, how do we choose when making our key? (if it means anything, I&#039;m using GNUPA)<br /><br />2: When you&#039;re creating the key, why can&#039;t the generator simulate entropy by using random values? <br /><br />3: If you make two keys with all the same information(passcode, email, etc), have the same processes running(which would easily be done by shutting off as much as you possibly can, even stuff like the file manager, using the task Task Manager) when you make them, have the same mouse movements (which could easily be done by putting the mouse in the far corner and entering your info in using only keystrokes) when you make them, will you end up with the same keys? (If&nbsp; GNU also uses different process states for making the key[process state being something like, &quot;Key 1 was generated 32 seconds after Windows booted up and 14 seconds after GNU was started, but Key 2 was generated 44 seconds after Windows started up and 17 seconds after GNU started&quot;], this could easily be circumvented by writing a script that would run immediately once the computer started. A script would also help solve the issue of killing processes and having the exact same keystrokes and mouse movements). If&nbsp; there is some sort of measure in place to prevent this from happening, what is it? <br /><br />4: Why exactly is PGP important? The importance of it is beyond stressed. It just seems a bit paranoid to me, considering how secure Tor is. Is it primarily to prevent outside lines that could be listening in(which I&#039;m pretty sure is fucking impossible with Tor) or is it only there if SR gets compromised(which may be more likely than the other, but is still relatively impossible)?

				2. There are no truly random number generating algorithms.&nbsp; They&#039;re predictable.&nbsp; They will generate the same numbers in the same sequence until the end of time; you&#039;re more random than that, so they use you and your computer interaction as a source of randomness.<br /><br />1. Import your own public key into gpg and look at it.&nbsp; Also, any program that doesn&#039;t even ask how many bits you want to use is either written by very good people who know to use big ones, or very bad people that I wouldn&#039;t trust.<br /><br />3. I don&#039;t know how the program uses your computer interaction as a source of entropy, but I suspect there will be subtle differences.&nbsp; Besides, pseudorandom number generation algorithms generate enormous ranges of numbers and usually your computer keeps its place between boots (that&#039;s &quot;seeding&quot; the entropy).<br /><br />4. It&#039;s to protect if SR is compromised and your order is still processing.&nbsp; It&#039;s also to protect against the vendor getting pinched and the law using his account.&nbsp; If your address is plaintext, well, you&#039;re their next person of interest (or they&#039;ll at least inform your local PD I should think).&nbsp; Basically, it&#039;s just a risk that isn&#039;t necessary.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not so that nobody can listen in.&nbsp; You&#039;re right, Tor protects against that (but only WITHIN the network, not outside it).

				Right. But how could you possibly write an algorithm to create such a degree of unpredictability? The malfunction would lie with the hardware, and that particular &quot;computer&quot;(quotation marks are because I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be considered a computer at this point) would then be a different computer than every single other functional computer of that model. But that&#039;s of course assuming that such malfunction can only occur on the hardware side of things. <br /><br /><br />Just look at the human brain. It&#039;s just a biological machine. It&#039;s mechanism of abstract thought seems to be the ability to create algorithms, the ability to create thoughts that don&#039;t abide by logic, and the ability the create random values. Once we figure out an algorithm that allows computers to do the same(if such a thing is even possible), what would be different? If you made a machine with the same architecture as the human brain(I don&#039;t mean arranging binary architecture into something kind of like the brain, but instead similar architecture at the lowest level), nothing would change. Hell, maybe even quantum computers will be able to produce abstract thought.

				Although we&#039;re getting very off topic, this 1999 example illustrates some of the hazards in generating sufficiently random numbers with a computer:<br /><br />from: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/s-playing/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How to cheat in online gambling<br />The Software Security Group at Reliable Software Technologies (RST) (see Resources) recently discovered a serious flaw in the implementation of Texas Hold &#039;em Poker that is distributed by ASF Software, Inc. (see Resources). The exploit allows a cheating player to calculate the exact deck being used for each hand in real time. That means a player using the exploit knows the cards in every opponent&#039;s hand as well as the cards that will make up the flop (cards placed face up on the table after rounds of betting). A cheater can &quot;know when to hold &#039;em and know when to fold &#039;em&quot; every time. A malicious attacker could use the exploit to bilk innocent players of actual money without ever being caught.<br /><br />The flaw exists in the card shuffling algorithm used to generate each deck. Ironically, the code was publicly displayed at http://www.planetpoker.com/ppfaq.htm with the idea of showing how fair the game is to interested players (the page has since been taken down). In the code, a call to randomize() is included to produce a random deck before each deck is generated. The implementation, built with Delphi 4 (a Pascal IDE), seeds the random number generator with the number of milliseconds since midnight, according to the system clock. That means the output of the random number generator is easily predicted. As we&#039;ve discussed, a predictable random number generator is a very serious security problem.<br /><br />The shuffling algorithm used in the ASF software always starts with an ordered deck of cards, and then generates a sequence of random numbers used to reorder the deck. In a real deck of cards, there are 52! (approximately 2226) possible unique shuffles. Recall that the seed for a 32-bit random number generator must be a 32-bit number, meaning that there are just over 4 billion possible seeds. Since the deck is reinitialized and the generator reseeded before each shuffle, only 4 billion possible shuffles can result from this algorithm. Four billion possible shuffles is alarmingly less than 52!.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the flawed algorithm chooses the seed for the random number generator using the Pascal function Randomize(). This particular Randomize() function chooses a seed based on the number of milliseconds since midnight. There are a mere 86,400,000 milliseconds in a day. Since this number was being used as the seed for the random number generator, the number of possible decks now reduces to 86,400,000. Eighty-six million is alarmingly less than four billion. But that&#039;s not all. It gets worse.<br /><br />The system clock seed gave Reliable Software Technologies an idea that reduced the number of possible shuffles even further. By synchronizing their program with the system clock on the server generating the pseudo-random number, they are able to reduce the number of possible combinations down to a number on the order of 200,000 possibilities. After that move, the system is broken, since searching through this tiny set of shuffles is trivial and can be done on a PC in real time.<br /><br />The RST-developed tool to exploit this vulnerability requires five cards from the deck to be known. Based on the five known cards, the program searches through the few hundred thousand possible shuffles and deduces which one is a perfect match. In the case of Texas Hold &#039;em Poker, this means the program takes as input the two cards that the cheating player is dealt, plus the first three community cards that are dealt face up (the flop). These five cards are known after the first of four rounds of betting, and are enough to determine (in real time, during play) the exact shuffle. The figure shows the graphical interface that RST slapped on its gambling exploit. The Site Parameters box in the upper left is used to synchronize the clocks. The Game Parameters box in the upper right is used to enter the five cards and initiate the search. The figure is a screen shot taken after all cards have been determined by the program. The cheating attacker knows who holds what cards, what the rest of the flop looks like, and who is going to win in advance.<br /><br />The interface for Reliable Software Technology&#039;s Internet poker exploit<br /><br />Once the program knows the five cards, it generates shuffles until it discovers the shuffle that contains the five known cards in the proper order. Since the Randomize() function is based on the server&#039;s system time, it is not very difficult to guess a starting seed with a reasonable degree of accuracy. (The closer you get, the fewer possible shuffles you have to look through.) Here&#039;s the kicker though: After finding a correct seed once, it is possible to synchronize the exploit program with the server to within a few seconds. This post facto synchronization allows the program to determine the seed being used by the random number generator, and to identify the shuffle being used during all future games in under one second!<br /><br />Technical details aside, this exploit garnered spectacular press coverage. The coverage emphasizes the human side of any such discovery. Visit the RST Web site (listed in Resources) for the original press release, the CNN video clip, and a New York Times story.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

(see Resources). The exploit allows a cheating player to calculate the exact deck being used for each hand in real time. That means a player using the exploit knows the cards in every opponent&#039;s hand as well as the cards that will make up the flop (cards placed face up on the table after rounds of betting). A cheater can &quot;know when to hold &#039;em and know when to fold &#039;em&quot; every time. A malicious attacker could use the exploit to bilk innocent players of actual money without ever being caught.<br /><br />The flaw exists in the card shuffling algorithm used to generate each deck. Ironically, the code was publicly displayed at http://www.planetpoker.com/ppfaq.htm with the idea of showing how fair the game is to interested players (the page has since been taken down). In the code, a call to randomize() is included to produce a random deck before each deck is generated. The implementation, built with Delphi 4 (a Pascal IDE), seeds the random number generator with the number of milliseconds since midnight, according to the system clock. That means the output of the random number generator is easily predicted. As we&#039;ve discussed, a predictable random number generator is a very serious security problem.<br /><br />The shuffling algorithm used in the ASF software always starts with an ordered deck of cards, and then generates a sequence of random numbers used to reorder the deck. In a real deck of cards, there are 52! (approximately 2226) possible unique shuffles. Recall that the seed for a 32-bit random number generator must be a 32-bit number, meaning that there are just over 4 billion possible seeds. Since the deck is reinitialized and the generator reseeded before each shuffle, only 4 billion possible shuffles can result from this algorithm. Four billion possible shuffles is alarmingly less than 52!.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the flawed algorithm chooses the seed for the random number generator using the Pascal function Randomize(). This particular Randomize() function chooses a seed based on the number of milliseconds since midnight. There are a mere 86,400,000 milliseconds in a day. Since this number was being used as the seed for the random number generator, the number of possible decks now reduces to 86,400,000. Eighty-six million is alarmingly less than four billion. But that&#039;s not all. It gets worse.<br /><br />The system clock seed gave Reliable Software Technologies an idea that reduced the number of possible shuffles even further. By synchronizing their program with the system clock on the server generating the pseudo-random number, they are able to reduce the number of possible combinations down to a number on the order of 200,000 possibilities. After that move, the system is broken, since searching through this tiny set of shuffles is trivial and can be done on a PC in real time.<br /><br />The RST-developed tool to exploit this vulnerability requires five cards from the deck to be known. Based on the five known cards, the program searches through the few hundred thousand possible shuffles and deduces which one is a perfect match. In the case of Texas Hold &#039;em Poker, this means the program takes as input the two cards that the cheating player is dealt, plus the first three community cards that are dealt face up (the flop). These five cards are known after the first of four rounds of betting, and are enough to determine (in real time, during play) the exact shuffle. The figure shows the graphical interface that RST slapped on its gambling exploit. The Site Parameters box in the upper left is used to synchronize the clocks. The Game Parameters box in the upper right is used to enter the five cards and initiate the search. The figure is a screen shot taken after all cards have been determined by the program. The cheating attacker knows who holds what cards, what the rest of the flop looks like, and who is going to win in advance.<br /><br />The interface for Reliable Software Technology&#039;s Internet poker exploit<br /><br />Once the program knows the five cards, it generates shuffles until it discovers the shuffle that contains the five known cards in the proper order. Since the Randomize() function is based on the server&#039;s system time, it is not very difficult to guess a starting seed with a reasonable degree of accuracy. (The closer you get, the fewer possible shuffles you have to look through.) Here&#039;s the kicker though: After finding a correct seed once, it is possible to synchronize the exploit program with the server to within a few seconds. This post facto synchronization allows the program to determine the seed being used by the random number generator, and to identify the shuffle being used during all future games in under one second!<br /><br />Technical details aside, this exploit garnered spectacular press coverage. The coverage emphasizes the human side of any such discovery. Visit the RST Web site (listed in Resources) for the original press release, the CNN video clip, and a New York Times story.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow that is a pretty stupid mistake to make. I figured they forgot to remove their mod bias or something. One thing you do with big random numbers is use them to get smaller random numbers. For example, if you get the number 1000 it isn&#039;t so helpful by itself in telling you which position in a deck a given card should be in. So what you do is essentially 1000 mod 52 = 12 <br /><br />but imagine that you want a random number from 0 to 2 but your RNG gives you numbers up to 4. One thing you could do is rng_output mod highest_number_desired++ , which is guaranteed to give you a number that is no greater than the highest number you want. But:<br /><br />0 mod 3 = 0<br />1 mod 3 = 1<br />2 mod 3 = 2<br />3 mod 3 = 0<br />4 mod 3 = 1<br /><br />now you are more likely to select 0 or 1 than 2, even if the initial larger number is itself random. This is called mod bias, and if measures are not taken against it, it can be a critical security vulnerability in a system that generates smaller numbers from a range using a bigger random number as the initial seed.

It&#039;s got a feature that lets you do the crypto on copied text while it&#039;s in the computer&#039;s clipboard memory, so when you paste it&#039;s encrypted (it also works in reverse for decrypting). If that sounds a little too disembodied for you, it&#039;s also got a regular text editor (confusingly also called a &quot;clipboard&quot;) that you can do the encryption/decryption operations on.

Although technically the key space is all primes between 0 and 127 bits, in practice I was told the key space is closer to the number of primes that are 127 bits.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s an excellent point!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to look into this some more when my brain is working again to see what kind of key space we&#039;re looking at. I&#039;ve been up for about 55 hours now and starting to get a little too loopy for math.&nbsp; :P :-X<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ok, I think I&#039;ve got the answer to this. First, the best primes are those that are about the same bit length, meaning they have to each be half the bit size of the key. According to the prime number theorem you can get a conservative estimate for the number of primes of a given bit size, m, with the formula<br />0.3*ln(2) * 2^m/(m-1)<br /><br />So assuming I haven&#039;t screwed up the math, here&#039;s what it gives:<br /><br />A 1024 bit key uses 512 bit primes. Number of 512 bit primes to choose from: 11.36*10^150&nbsp; :o<br /><br />A 2048 bit key uses 1024 bit primes. Number of 1024 bit primes to choose from: 7.61*10^304&nbsp; :o :o<br /><br />A 4096 bit key uses 2048 bit primes. Number of 2048 bit primes to choose from: 1.58x10^613&nbsp; :o :o :o<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=102736.msg722600#msg722600">Quote from: astor on January 12, 2013, 10:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=102736.msg722326#msg722326">Quote from: SorryMario on January 12, 2013, 08:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The only bad part about using a command line it means the plaintext message has to be saved on a file somewhere.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No it doesn&#039;t.
