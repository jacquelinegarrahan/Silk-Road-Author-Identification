				It&#039;s interesting that Tor makes the list of the three main tabs in a GUI for querying TLS/SSL traffic.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first appears to be a target justification tab (i.e. the part where you pretend it&#039;s a legitimate query).&nbsp; The second is the main SSL query window.&nbsp; The third is labeled &quot;Tor events QFD&quot;.&nbsp; Dunno WTF QFD is.&nbsp; &nbsp;Quick find database? query flow database?<br /><br />Assuming that&#039;s a general GUI interface that we&#039;re seeing screenshots of (and not Analyst X&#039;s customized tab view), the only conclusion is that Tor is a very significant priority for NSA, and that data is queried often enough to make the main window.&nbsp; &nbsp; It rates one of the two data-related tabs on the interface.<br /><br />Not surprising, really, given the sheer number of Tor users and the percentage of Tor traffic that&#039;s bound to be &quot;interesting&quot; to NSA.<br /><br />My guess is that it&#039;s exactly what it appears to be.&nbsp; A searchable database of their known Tor events.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traffic from exit nodes, traffic headed to entry guards, traffic flows between Tor nodes, traffic matching any DPI patterns to identify Tor, all the Tor data they can extrapolate from Tor routing database, up/down for relays and nodes, all the internal data from the Tor relays they operate, etc.<br /><br />And the latest date I see on the slides is Oct 26 2011.&nbsp; &nbsp;So that was two years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Which is a long, long time ago in the grand scheme of exchanging billions of dollars for capabilities.<br /><br />

				What&#039;s QFD? Quality Function Deployment? Though I doubt the check the quality of the Tor network.<br />Anyway Tor events may just mean &quot;someone connected to a website using Tor&quot;, probably with entry node/real IP if possible to find it with traffic analysis.

				It seems to me that whole program is for finding/tracking somebody. Esp the &quot;GEOFUSION export&quot; part which is GIS mapping. So it seems likely the NSA runs nodes and with this program you can check to see if said person has been traversing them, and maybe they (unluckily) used all 3 hops that were owned by NSA. <br /><br />QFD (Quality Function deployment) in regular world lingo would mean deployment on Tor to maybe launch your MITM attack server, however this is NSA where all acronyms are completely different on purpose to detract from what they&#039;re actually doing. It would be Quack Flying Duck for all we know, yet another code word for lighting the constitution on fire.<br /><br />It could also be that a targeted person is using a backdoored version of Tor. Schneier, and the Tor project believe the digital signatures on their builds are now meaningless, the NSA is probably MITM attacking targets and getting them to download backdoored Torbrowser bundles and these events are the backdoors reporting back to HQ. Scheneir in his blog&#039;s Sept 6 comments fully believes all open source projects including Linux can easily be &quot;cheated&quot; by subverting the download process and instead getting a nice MITM payload from the NSA instead of torproject.org<br /><br />Hell, even torproject.org devs are now doing deterministic builds and no longer trust their own compilers, believing it would be the easiest way to automate a backdoor into every version of Tor, hide it in the compiler.<br /><br /><br />
