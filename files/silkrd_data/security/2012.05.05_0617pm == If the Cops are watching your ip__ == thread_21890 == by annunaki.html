				Anybody on your wireless network can view the data you send through it if it isn&#039;t encrypted/secure, with the right software.<br /><br />Not sure about tor.

				Tor traffic looks like Tor traffic. It is fully encrypted and unreadable to them. They only can do timing attacks, such as watching time when your Tor node sends data and in same time the message appears in place they are already watching.<br /><br />If You suspect that you are watched, encrypt your hard drive with TrueCrypt and chooze strong password. If they are looking at you, they will get a visit for sure.

				Can you please explain an unexperienced like me, what is happening if LE visits you and check your computer..<br />What could they find? Having Tor installed is allowed, having some Encryption programs installed is allowed.. Having Bitcoins isn&#039;t a crime.<br />So what can they find ?<br />

				your ISP has full records of every site you&#039;ve been to, all your dns requests, every search you&#039;ve ever done on google....<br /><br />unless you used tor to look up this site all that info is available to them. <br /><br />tor bridge also helps conceal tor traffic a bit but China already found a way to follow bridge users. they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing as tor is encrypted but they can tell they&#039;re using it.&nbsp; break into wireless lol<br />

Also all CD&#039;s, mobile phones, USB flash drives, memory cards will be taken.<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What could they find?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>All activities with those programs. Bitcoin client keeps debug log by default. Software store portions of all sorts of data in swap file. You can&#039;t be sure for that. And if the cops don&#039;t find they are looking for, they can plant the evidence themselves if the drive is not encrypted with TrueCrypt. This strongly depends from location and circumstances.<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">tor bridge also helps conceal tor traffic a bit but China already found a way to follow bridge users. they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing as tor is encrypted but they can tell they&#039;re using it.&nbsp; break into wireless lol</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Tor nodes accepts incoming SSL requests, so if your computer responds to SSL request, you are blocked by great firewall.<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">format our HDD completely with DBan or something or to have some really good Truecrypt encryption?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Better encrypt hard drive with TrueCrypt because you can&#039;t use computer that is wiped clean of any data and OS with DBAN. Ot use DBAN to clean the drive and then do clean OS install and encrypt it with TrueCrypt as soon as possible.
