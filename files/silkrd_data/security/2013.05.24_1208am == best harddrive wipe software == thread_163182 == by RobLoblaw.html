				reading a lot of the old posts in the security section and i&#039;ve decided i&#039;m going to wipe my harddrive and start fresh in the case i have anything stored on there that might be negative in the chances i get my computer seized. its an old computer, about 3 years and i cant remember all the stuff i have done on it and frankly before i joined SR i wasn&#039;t too concerned about security and anonymity. <br /><br />what is the best program to use to wipe my harddrive? if its free that would be even better.<br /><br />also, after i do wipe it, when i put my ubuntu disk into my cd drive will it still install like normal?

				Hardware erasure is better than software erasure, so check if your hard drive has the ATA secure erase feature and use that if it does.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t, like Christy said, DBAN it.<br /><br />Also: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99520.msg699299#msg699299

				thanks for input<br />i will look into this hardware erasure and see if mine has that option. if not i will go and get all those programs and do it that way.<br />i&#039;m not familiar with the lingo sorry lol memtest86 appears to be a program to test memory. what do you mean when you say +-flash the bios with newest +? will this also erase the bios on my computer? <br />and whats the purpose of running a memory test program right before your going to erase everything?<br />thank you for the link. i&#039;m reading it now and the information is very useful

				Download the DBAN iso and burn it to a CD. 1 pass is enough, in fact no-one on this forum will ever be able to provide evidence of data being recovered after a single pass. Because that evidence does not exist. Peter Gutmann&#039;s method is only relevant to MFM &amp; RLL encoded disks, it was not designed for modern hard drives nor does it serve a purpose on them. 1 pass is enough.

				The actual best eraser is HDDerase. I&#039;m not an IT expert or whatever, but it&#039;s something called secure erase. <br /><br />Now If you really are super paranoid of whatever is on your computer; you first fully encrypt it with something like truecrypt with the max. charachters allowed passphrase that is totally random and put all weird shit it in it.; this way it it&#039;ll never be bruteforced. Then use HDD erase.

It will be helpful to other SR user if they know how LEO goes through your HDD when they seize your equipment. A good place to start is the most LEA agencies use, EnCase.<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is a bad way to try to wipe your HD because it relies on the implementation of the FDE system. Pretty much when you wipe your drive with FDE, you are hoping that the FDE implementation you are using utilizes a Full Disk Wiping system of its own. Much safer to use something actually designed to wipe the entire disk in the first place.
