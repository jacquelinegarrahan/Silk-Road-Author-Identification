				Hello my friends<br /><br />Recently I have felt I am not being as safe as I would like when it comes to receiving packages. I am thinking that maybe I need to change this. For now I am using a&nbsp; PO box, I know this is not safe, but I can&#039;t think of a better way to receive my orders. I do not want to involve anyone else in my business, and I do not want to receive at my home, however I can not think of a better way to receive anonymously. I&#039;ve searched these forums but have not found an adequate solution. I apologize if I overlooked a possibility previously discussed here, but regardless I humbly request everyone&#039;s here opinion on what I should do?<br /><br />Thank you...&nbsp; 8)

				getting it shipped to your house with your real name would be the best for plausible deniablity due to the fact that anyone can send you drugs in the mail and you wouldn&#039;t have any knowledge. But now if you get shit sent to your PO box that is pretty damn hard to deny it considering only people you tell your PO box&#039;s address then you&#039;ll know it.

				Yes, I agree with you on this. I failed to realize this prior to opening a box. However, I am still uncomfortable with receiving packages at home and was hoping there was some sort of alternative. <br /><br />Thank you for your reply, my friend.

				A post office box isn&#039;t really that bad.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had several PO Boxes for legitimate IRL stuff, and I always got shit addressed to the previous N box holders.&nbsp; So there&#039;s still a fair amount of plausible deniability.&nbsp; Or, put the box in the name of a business.&nbsp; Businesses have lots of employees, right?&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t you that ordered that 100g of MDMA, it was that asshole in the accounting department.&nbsp; You always knew there was something fucked up about that guy....

Of course the Police could stake the address out 24/7 and there&#039;s a risk that one of the other residents will get to the package before you do but I would say it&#039;s safer than having controlled drugs posted through your own letter box.<br /><br />Another method used by one of my &quot;associates&quot; is to grow your beard out a little, dress untidily and pitch up at a church of a Sunday and make it known you&#039;re out of work and homeless - wait for some elderly do-gooder to offer to help and say you could use some help in having a &quot;reply to&quot; address for your job applications. <br /><br />In this case my right and honorable friend was receiving stolen ID&#039;s so it was unlikely the old timers would have got into any trouble but if the thought of someone&#039;s Grandma being carted away for receiving heroin is too much for you, remember you can always come forward and take the rap if she is caught.<br /><br />I realise this is a bit ruthless but there&#039;s no harm in considering all the options!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				There are many safe ways to receive packages using a PO Box opened with a fake ID (or even with &quot;no&quot; ID), especially if you have at least one partner. Importers have been doing it for years. We&#039;ve dropped hints here and there around the forums. But a PO Box isn&#039;t really neccassary for domestic orders.<br /><br />Personally, I (and many others I know) feel there is MORE &quot;plausable-deniability&quot; using a FAKE name if it&#039;s getting it delivered to your home address. &quot;Anyone&quot; could have &#039;very&#039; easily &#039;mis-addressed a letter or package. I think a jury would believe that before believing &quot;someone sent you drugs to try and get you in trouble&quot;. Especially when the DA brings in the &quot;expert&quot; describing the miniscule amount of letters/packages that actually get intercepted. <br /><br />Essentially, it&#039;s not a very good way to try and &quot;get someone in trouble&quot; but a better way to &quot;give away free drugs to your enemy&quot;. :)<br /><br />After receiving your package, simply write &quot;Return to Sender&quot; on it, put it on top of your fridge for a couple hours. Go for a walk/drive. If by the time you come back there&#039;s no police surrounding you or your house, it&#039;s probably pretty safe to open. ;)<br /><br />Peace<br />

				Thank you everyone for your replies. I have decided perhaps it is just bust to have it delivered to my home and pull the &quot;return to sender&quot; insurance trick.<br /><br />Thank you again for your time
