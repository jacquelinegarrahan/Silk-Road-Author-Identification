				I have to say, first of all, I&#039;m impressed with the quality of people here.&nbsp; I have read through the forums and have had most of my questions answered, though a few remain.<br /><br />1) Does having Tor open along with one&#039;s normal browser present any security risks?&nbsp; Suppose I have these SR forums up and, say, music playing from YouTube in a normal browser? <br /><br />2) I am ready (or almost anyway) to make my first purchase on SR.&nbsp; I wanted to thank John Keats (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0) for a fairly simple all-in-one guide.&nbsp; But while I have tentatively grasped the concept of BitCoins, I have some trouble with understanding the details.&nbsp; I can make a fake Mt Gox account via a public computer and use BitInstant to fund it, but couldn&#039;t I also just use BitInstant&#039;s &quot;Send to BTC Address&quot; option as well, assuming I use a tumbler (BitFog) and multiple wallets?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />3) BitInstant also requires a full name and cell phone number.&nbsp; I assume one should use false information here.&nbsp; Is it that bad if I give them real information at a CVS or Wal-Mart?&nbsp; I will be a small time buyer, just getting a few (5-10) blotters of LSD rather infrequently.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you all in advance.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I just asked your first question at http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92035.msg648241#msg648241<br /><br />SelfSovereignty had a great reply<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92035.msg648261#msg648261">Quote from: SelfSovereignty on December 07, 2012, 04:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So the super short answer is &quot;yes.&quot;&nbsp; The longer one is &quot;sort of, but only a little.&quot;<br /><br />For a buyer, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; The biggest risk I think is accidentally trying to log in to an account in the wrong browser and boom, sending a DNS request for silk road&#039;s address to your ISP (which doesn&#039;t sound good -- &quot;hi, where do I find illegal drugs please -- redirect me plz&quot; is just silly even if it isn&#039;t logged).<br /><br />Or trying to log in to, say, MtGox and getting your account frozen because you accessed from Tor.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; Human error that probably will happen eventually if you aren&#039;t super careful 24/7 (and nobody is, so you have to come up with a way around that -- two monitors?&nbsp; One on each monitor... that&#039;s what I do, and I haven&#039;t fucked up yet anyway).<br /><br />The longer answer is that it does make it easier for specific attacks against the Tor network to identify you.&nbsp; How much easier I can&#039;t tell you, but they&#039;d have to want to find you pretty bad to even bother trying, so as a buyer I don&#039;t see it as a risk.&nbsp; Well, it is, but it&#039;s a risk I take myself -- put it that way.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be so cavalier if I faced 30 to life if caught, though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				answer to #2: Yes that should be fine<br />answer to #3: As long as you aren&#039;t bringing a mess load of money over very frequently you should be ok, It is obviously not recommended, but if your just get a few tabs of lsd every month, you can turn around and say your buying something of the BTC forums on the clear net (steam video game code, computer hardware etc etc), however, you defiantly would want to send the coins through a washing service.
