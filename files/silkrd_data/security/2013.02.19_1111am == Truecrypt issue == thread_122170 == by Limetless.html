				Ok so I have been away for a while because I can&#039;t access my files on my Truecrypt container which is on a USB. When I try to mount the device it comes up with the following - <br /><br />hdiutil: attach failed - no mountable file systems<br /><br />Now this happened all of a sudden and I haven&#039;t done anything out of the ordinary. I looked online and others have had this issue too but the solutions were fairly vague. Can somebody suggest a way to fix this? <br /><br />Lim

				First thing is to try and mount it read only, it looks like that can work in some cases. Select it in truecrypt as normal, but when you get to the password input section, click on the options button. This expands some additional things, check mount volume as read only. That will possibly let you access the content on the USB. If it does, I suggest storing it to an encrypted file container temporarily, and then formatting the USB device and re-encrypting it with truecrypt, making sure to select some filesystem that is compatible with whatever OS you are using, then you can put your content back on it and wipe the temporary encrypted file container. That is the first thing to try anyway. It looks like it can also be caused by corruption, in which case you may be fucked unfortunately. It also looks like it can be caused by trying to mount a filesystem that is not compatible with your operating system. That is just what I can gather from a quick google search, let me know how that works for you and if it doesn&#039;t I will try to find something else for you to try.

				looks like it could also be caused from a corrupt header, in which case you have a chance to restore it from the embedded backup header. If the first solution does not work, attempt the following:<br /><br />truecrypt --restore-headers /path/to/the/usb/device<br /><br />you will be prompted and asked if you want to backup from a header backup you saved, or from the embedded header backup Truecrypt automatically added to the volume. Click on embedded and cross your fingers that it works I suppose. <br /><br />That is the Linux command anyway it might be different on the Mac version, try truecrypt --help if that command fails and see if there is a Mac equivalent.

				Fucking macs... they actually take the Linux kernel and modify it -- that&#039;s what a Mac is; I thought they&#039;d leave the kernel logging stuff alone, but I guess not.&nbsp; Just a waste of your time then, sorry.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering though kmf... it sounds to me like TrueCrypt isn&#039;t a journaled file system and the thing didn&#039;t get unmounted properly.&nbsp; The TrueCrypt site says that you can create a rescue disk to boot up and access a drive that&#039;s suffering from a corrupted boot loader.&nbsp; Why isn&#039;t that a good idea?

				The problem is that he doesn&#039;t know what the chardev of the USB device is, bro... :)&nbsp; At least I think so, that&#039;s why he&#039;s having so much trouble.<br /><br />Does the &quot;lsusb&quot; command work Lim?&nbsp; If that does, type &quot;lsusb -v&quot; and look for... well, something that sounds like a usb key.&nbsp; That&#039;s gonna suck though, FYI.&nbsp; You could try looking at the &quot;/var/log/messages&quot; file if it exists too.<br /><br />Or just load up any GUI program that can autodetect when a device gets plugged in.&nbsp; When you plug it in, the kernel (BSD, Linux, doesn&#039;t matter) creates a file that you can use to access the device.&nbsp; It&#039;s the filename that you need.&nbsp; So all you have to do is find out what the name of that is.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably the last one named &quot;sXX&quot; in /dev/.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have one per hard drive -- so if it&#039;s a laptop, it&#039;s going to have &quot;sda&quot; as the internal hard drive, and the usb key would be &quot;sdb.&quot;<br /><br />... this is based on Linux.&nbsp; I never use macs, so if anybody&#039;s got a better idea, by all means -- tell me to shutup.<br />

				... I&#039;m sorry man, but I think your USB key may have just died.&nbsp; They do have a pretty limited life span, unfortunately.&nbsp; How long have you been using it?&nbsp; You can try opening Disk Utility in Applications, but... that&#039;s some guy online saying that, I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s really going to detect a device that has a damaged file system.<br /><br />If there&#039;s nothing there, go to System Profile and wander to wherever the USB devices are.&nbsp; If it STILL isn&#039;t there... it&#039;s most likely fried for good.&nbsp; You can also open the &quot;/dev&quot; directory, and just plug the thing and pull it out (NOT FAST, like every 5 seconds or something pull it out, wait a few, plug it in, etc.).<br /><br />If plugging it in and unplugging it while you&#039;re watching the &quot;/dev&quot; directory doesn&#039;t cause any new file to be created and to disappear -- and remember you&#039;ll probably have to keep hitting &quot;refresh&quot; in the folder view -- anyway, if nothing happens then... I think it gave up the ghost.

				I think he is either typing the commands wrong somehow, or they are in a different format on OSX. I think his USB device is still fine because Truecrypt must have detected it for him to attempt to mount it. If recovering the header from the embedded backup doesn&#039;t work, when we find out how to do that on OSX, then you can try to mount it without a filesystem and repair it. If that doesn&#039;t work I give up.

				you have two options. One is that you could run the command as root, since that will take care of the permissions problem.

				Er, uh... Limetless, good buddy good pal, ol&#039; gangster friend of mine... I think you have a serious issue if you consider yourself secure, because what you just said shouldn&#039;t be possible.&nbsp; If you can access ANYTHING on that USB drive, ANYTHING AT ALL, it is not corrupted.&nbsp; It is fine.&nbsp; If you can only access PARTS of it, it&#039;s still not corrupted.&nbsp; The files are all fucked, maybe even sectors (or whatever USB keys have that&#039;s the equivalent of a hard drive sector) have died permanently, but that still doesn&#039;t mean that the problem is what you think it is.<br /><br />If you can read anything on that thing at all, the filesystem is intact.&nbsp; If you can still decrypt stuff without being able to read anything at all on that USB key... you have not been keeping your keychain on your USB key.&nbsp; Moreover, you don&#039;t know where you&#039;ve been keeping it.&nbsp; That&#039;s... bad, for someone who vends and who would be a prime target for anybody who wants to make a splash over on your side of the pond -- whether you deserve the praise you give yourself or not, you gotta admit... you give it freely, and that could draw attention :) <br /><br />To be clear, all you need to ENcrypt is the program itself.&nbsp; To decrypt you need your private key.&nbsp; So no, it&#039;s not weird at all.&nbsp; Except that you have the program installed somewhere other than the USB key, which means it would be easy to use the wrong one (which would presumably keep the key in the wrong place, and you see where I&#039;m going).

So you can access GPG that is on the USB device? Is it a portable version of GPG or something? So Truecrypt actually does let you mount the device after typing in your password? Is the entire device encrypted or do you have an encrypted file container on it with other things that are not encrypted? If that is the case you need to give the path to the file container instead of the USB device.
