				I tried Bitfloor for the first time about a week ago and have used it twice since.&nbsp; The money seems to show up in your account INstantly, and without the wait of Bitinstant.&nbsp; And the employees at BOA seem to be MORE THAN HELPFUL when processing the deposits.&nbsp; One cute banker even showed me where to put the account number after I screwed it up the first time.<br />&nbsp; The process of trading and using Bitfloor is so Smoooooooth sailing, that I doubt I will ever return to BitInstant to buy BTC again.&nbsp; No dirty looks, no comments or questions from the clerks, no double commission, and NO ID.&nbsp; No foreign currency check....<br /><br />Granted, the bank does have camera&#039;s; but so do Walmart, CVS and 7-11.&nbsp; Just wanted to give some props to the site and to the MEMBERS OF SR for discussing this place as a great alternative to BI, when they went to shit (and apparently still have not recovered.)

				I was a fairly ardent supporter of Bitinstant before the most recent incidents. Switched to Bitfloor, and the first transaction went smoother than every single Bitinstant transaction I have ever had. Within 2 hours of the deposit I had the money in my SR account, and the BoA employees were more than helpful in guiding me through my first ever bank deposit.

				BitInstant was down when I was finally ready to get my first set of bitcoins for SilkRoad purchases.&nbsp; I went away for a week, came back, and tried again and they were still down.. and another.. to which they were down again for 4 days.<br /><br />I got sick of waiting and the reviews for that weekend&#039;s mess were unbelievably horrid, so I went ahead and used BitFloor.<br /><br />Couldn&#039;t be happier.&nbsp; Bank of America clerks are super friendly, the process was fast, and I only have to tack on about 10% of my SilkRoad purchase amounts for the fees.&nbsp; Their deposit fees seem to have gone up from my first transaction, but even though the second was more expensive it was even quicker than the first (which was already damn near instant).<br /><br />I&#039;ll continue using them until something goes awry!
