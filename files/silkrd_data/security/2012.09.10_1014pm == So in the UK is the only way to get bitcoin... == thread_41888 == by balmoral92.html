				If you don&#039;t mind the lack of anonimity you can do Bank Xfer&#039;s from your bank to MtGox all from the comfort of your computer chair, however this isn&#039;t really safe and leaves a paper trail (shouldn&#039;t be a problem with small amounts but don&#039;t do this if your moving serious weight!)<br />There are lots of vendors on bitcoin forums who offer BTC for Ukash, Prepaid Visa or cash in the mail but yeah... you would have to leave the house to sort these out.

				Na man. You buy the ukash voucher which you then transfer to btc online. <br />Search ukash to btc on google or bitcoing forums. It allows you to keep relatively anonymous. Definitely moreso than bank transfer.

				Sounds pretty strange to me mate, never had problems with Gox when i&#039;ve used them.<br />Are you showing a +GBP balance in the account (top right side next to the British flag)<br />If you have the funds confirmed on gox you should be able to put in a buy order for anything below that balance, if it is saying insufficient funds that means either your funds have not cleared with them yet or you are trying to purchase more BTC than your balance allows.

				Mashman can you recommend any sites you use? Are there any official sites or is it all just people offering to buy them? Thank for the info so far!<br /><br />xdjx i appreciate your help aswell mate but Gox is proving to be too complicated, i think i might understand it slightly but not fully and would have to travel further to find a barclays than i would to find a store where i can purchase ukash so hopefully i can get some that way.

				If you only want to do Ukash transfers that isn&#039;t a problem just means slightly more effort to go get the voucher and find a reliable exchanger. For Ukash to bitcoin trades I would recommend you take a look at the bitcointalk and bitcoin-otc websites as you can normally find people who will do the exchange for you and then you can look around amongst these vendors for the best rate.<br /><br />Just a few rules of thumb for these kind of buys: <br />1. Never give your voucher code to someone who does not have an amazing reputation (clearnet), if necessary buy your voucher in parts so that way you can avoid losing all your cash if you do get scammed.<br />2. Start off small and build a rapport with your exchanger.<br />3. If it&#039;s too good to be true it probably is...<br /><br />Good luck mate :)

				From his website : 9.5% over bitcoin&#039;s 24h average<br />&nbsp;and get included in the final quote, along with my 0.12btc commission per transaction <br /><br />Although if you are going to go for it my first transaction which was £10 ukash was processed very quickly and i got it within 2 mins of email sayin he had sent the BTC to me but the 2nd which was 40 BTC i am still waiting on and i am getting a bit worried tbh mate i mean it might be because it is more obviously but i dunno, the guy from the site has kept contact and i am still speaking to him just now so i don&#039;t know if thats a good sign because i think if it was a scam 1. i wouldn&#039;t of got the first bitcoin and 2. he would of just took the money and ignored me i would think, but yeah if you want to wait till i let you know that the £40 one went through so you don&#039;t make a mistake then its up to you

				First tenner was probably to gain your trust, knowing that you were going to deposit a larger amount.&nbsp; Hey, it may also just be taking longer to process. <br /><br />I&#039;m also looking for an anonymous way of obtaining BTC and having some problems. Basically, I don&#039;t want my name associated with the purchase of BTC at all.&nbsp; Helps distance my association with the SR.

				It did go through in the end though so he obviously isnt a scammer, it was just the difference in the length of time from 2 mins for 1 BTC to go through to about 2 hours for 4 BTC, i dunno if that&#039;s how it works the larger the BTC number the longer it takes? It makes sense anyway but yeah i got it in the end so i would recommend :) You do have to provide an email so i guess if your names in the email just get a new email just to use it?

				Yeh sorry, it warned me another post had been made but I thought &#039;fuck it, can;t be that important&#039;&nbsp; :o.<br /><br />Yeh use same email you set SR up with.

				Things That Annoy or at Least Slightly Bother Pine, Part 1 of a 2 Part Series<br /><br />TTALSBP Part 1:<br /><br />I must say, it annoys me when somebody in a thread says, hey, go to this link, or watch this youtube video, etc, and then people do this.<br /><br />Why do you imagine that is? It&#039;s not usually the recommendation that is the problem. <br /><br />It&#039;s visiting it within a short time on clearnet after somebody on the darknet recommended it (or visiting a very obscure long url), and worse still, telling us on an anonymous darknet forum that you have actually done this on clearnet. The location of the logged record of your IP address is now obtainable. I&#039;m not saying it will be, but it&#039;s still true.<br /><br />This is known in technical whitepapers in academia as an intersection attack. The only protection against it is an anonymity solution, like visiting with Tor, or else strength through numbers. e.g. visiting google.com through clearnet in the next ten seconds is a bad intersection attack for your adversary, but visiting www.seriouslyobscure.url/onlysixpeoplevisitedthispageintheentireyearandfiveofthoseweresearchenginespiders.html in the next month is a very good intersection attack.<br /><br />Point is, use clearnet with clearnet, and Tor with Tor, and don&#039;t swop between the two in any way, shape or form or you&#039;ll be threatening your anonymity.<br /><br />Bonus credit: Don&#039;t search for information you&#039;re about to have inside one of your posts, using a clearnet search engine just because it&#039;s quicker.<br /><br />TTALSBP Part 2: I live in X, thus I must obtain B$ in this specific country X.<br /><br />People from durkadurkastan probably don&#039;t acquire bitcoins from durkadurkastan because close to nobody there has bitcoins. It is true that things like cash deposits at banks or services like localbitcoin are going to have to occur inside a region near you, but otherwise, the majority of methods of obtaining bitcoin are available to the entire planet so long as you have a way to get your money online.<br /><br />There was a fellow here recently complaining that he was in Japan and couldn&#039;t get bitcoins that easily. There are 127,000,000 people who live in Japan, and nearly all of them are geeks, I think there are bitcoins in Japan, the largest exchange is there. There *has* to be a bitcoin exchange website setup like bitcoin-otc, but I cannot read Japanese, so maybe he needed to make some friends with Japanese people who speak English. Anyway, my point is that the real problem is not getting bitcoins, but doing some middle step in your situation before obtaining bitcoins.<br /><br />To wit: if you have a method of putting credit online in some form, then you can obtain bitcoins by finding somebody to exchange that credit with.<br /><br />Bonus credit: Use cash with ukash and read my tutorial in the sig.<br /><br />btw: when zazoo says to use the same email you used to setup SR, what does this mean? Are you referring to some service like Tormail zazoo?

The main issues are practical, that many webmail sites force you to use JavaScript to sign up and not to have your clearnet browser open logged into the same provider of webmail, and also have the same thing on the TBB with a different a/c. It&#039;s not that they share cookies or something, it&#039;s that if your computer goes down, they can correlate with a timing attack that the two people are the same person. If those aren&#039;t a problem, then it&#039;s unlikely to be a problem.<br /><br />The problem with using a webmail that you also use in RL, is also psychological, that you may accidentally login on the wrong browser without even realizing it. It&#039;s not as if the TBB and Firefox seem very different, and many people login to their webmail multiple times a day (I hear crazy things, like office workers logging in an average of 20 times a day, but not sure this is true) out of sheer habit. Something like this is what got Sabu, he accientally logged in once through a non-Torified IRC and then they got him. Actually, I think it&#039;s more likely they used an illegal exploit embedded in his fucking Macintosh software that everybody else also has because the people who run Apple are complete cunts, and then covered this up by waiting for him to make a mistake and then pouncing, because it seems a bit too twee and perfect and I know operations are much more hairy than that -- the best of conspiracy pine theory<br /><br />As for &#039;quadrotors&#039; etc&nbsp; they may have done, but I certainly wasn&#039;t one of them. Visiting a youtube video immediately after it is recommended is dumb, but visiting it after a day or so is fine, something like 10k+ people per day would have watched such a video by then. Also you can download youtube videos over Tor and watch them in a VM anyway (tutorial in sig...). <br /><br />With that URL (red mist), I never actually visited it on clearnet either. In fact, if I remember correctly I didn&#039;t so much as visit it with Tor, an image search engine proxy did that on my behalf and I just chose the correct URL. In any case, the very best thing anybody has logged about anything visiting those URLs on Tor is the IP address of a couple of exit nodes, which is completely worthless. When youtube and everybody else upgrades to HTML5 completely, all this stuff becomes less of an issue when the dreaded flash won&#039;t be used anymore.<br /><br />Maybe you&#039;re right and I should be mentioning these things more often, in case people think it&#039;s ok or something to visit these things on clearnet. I can&#039;t assume everybody hasn&#039;t thought of this stuff though, or it&#039;ll sound like I&#039;m lecturing everybody on A B C all the time, which will get annoying quickly. Maybe a -- Don&#039;t Go To This On Clearnet -- tag convention will be enough.<br /><br />The key thing to avoid is those threads about post your favorite youtube music videos and make a playlist kind of threads. Then you have people from SR hypothetically hopping from specific music video to specific music video within a very short space of time, in which case a intersection attack would be highly effective if somebody bothered to do it. <br /><br />This sounds more complicated than it actually is. If you&#039;re a LEO, you just say to Google: I want the IP addresses of everybody, give or take x %, who was at this URL and this URL and this URL... between the hours of X and Y GMT. In other words, an intersection attack does not have to be a technically skilled adversary.<br /><br />The other thing is those &quot;post your favorite book/movie&quot; threads. While I don&#039;t think the OP is malicious, requests could be made to Amazon to check if there&#039;s any customers who bought X Y Z books.<br /><br />The main message of this post, is to understand the fundamental principal of counting because that is the probabilistic basis of intersection attacks.&nbsp; Being aware is the key to defeating such detective work. The other thing is placing thousands of tiny red herrings nobody would even imagine are lies because they don&#039;t sound like anything somebody would lie about.<br /><br />Together, defensive (using Tor for everything) and offensive (lying all the time), both techniques cover your ass.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve just used that vendor and after some small difficulty to begin with he&#039;s come through for me.<br /><br />Happy with that...<br /><br />However I have a few questions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used blockchain and then transferred 1.5 BTC over to my SR BTC address around 1.45 mins but still nothing.<br /><br />I appreciate it asks you to wait a few hours but what&#039;s the average waiting time? Can it exceed days?<br /><br />Also Blockchain would not allow me to send 1.54 BTC. Why is this? <br /><br />I now have 3.5158 BTC to transfer will it even allow the entire amount? If not I&#039;ll need to purchase like another 0.5 BTC to be safe

				Agreed Pine.&nbsp; I actually thought I was being overly paranoid when thinking of revealing details of myself that I know to be false, just to throw anyone snooping off the scent.&nbsp; For small time users, I&#039;m sure this is overly cautious, but for vendors this is a reality.&nbsp; It makes me wonder how naive some of the vendors are at times with the information they release, or even saying they are just about to post their orders.<br /><br />Some vendors post from relatively small places where it wouldn&#039;t be out of the question to deploy people waiting at the boxes with a concerted effort.&nbsp; Very costly, but would be a nice feather in the cap for LE to boast about.&nbsp; Over the course of 5000 posts, anyone determined enough could piece together snippets of info and build a sizeable profile.&nbsp; Unless of course they are sending out red herrings.<br /><br />Don&#039;t intend on stirring up more paranoia, just healthy caution to those I want to see serving for years.&nbsp; PGP should be a prerequisite to a seller account.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy, even for someone with no computer knowledge.

The guys are trying to run a legit little business and the first person who emailed said something like &#039;hey man, can you pay directly into my SR account if i give you my user name... i want to buy some E&#039;s for the weekend&#039; or words to that effect and they obviously run a mile. So anyway they are now doing &#039;public&#039; trades on localbitcoins.com - i know a few of you have started using it anyway but it would seem like the place to go as they have an escrow system etc i know BtcDiscreet do face to face appointments in London but I&#039;m pretty sure cash in the mail nationally too... so yep, they would be worth checking out - just don&#039;t mention SR! ha! <br /><br />cheers, TonyGlow/SLL
