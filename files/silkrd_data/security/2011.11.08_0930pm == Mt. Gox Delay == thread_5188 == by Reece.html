				If you&#039;re trying to load BTC into your SR account from Gox, it&#039;ll be a while. I withdrew coins from them early yesterday and have yet to receive them. After emailing them with the blockexplorer link that shows that no coins have recently been sent, I get the following message:<br /><br />&quot;Hello,<br /><br />We are experiencing some delays with large bitcoin withdrawls. Once this issue is resolved, it will appear on block explorer. Thank you for your patience in the process.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />MtGox.com Team&quot;<br /><br />If you need coins fast, do not currently use them.<br />Just a heads up!

				And, apparently by extension, Get-Bitcoin. They work out of an Mt.Gox account and since they sent the funds last night, I have not received them..18 hours later. I hope this issue is resolved soon as I did not give myself much room for error, and I need my product before next weekend..

				Mt. Gox is experiencing some crazy growing pains right now, I would default to the smaller exchanges for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;Tradehill, Intersango, and Campbx are all fine alternatives.&nbsp; The lower volumes might result in poorer trade opportunities, but as of this moment, all of them seem to be favoring buyer markets compared to Gox.

				Just shown in Blockexplorer two minutes ago.<br />My coins seemed to have just went through. Hope the same is for everyone else!

				Was just about to post the same thing, Reece. I transferred 1btc myself and it appeared in blockexplorer, followed by the transfer from Get-Bitcoin. Now the 1btc is in my SR wallet and I expect the other to soon follow. What a nail biter! I&#039;m going to try and shy away from Mt.Gox from now on..

				I&#039;m in the same boat... It&#039;s been 11 hours and my btc still haven&#039;t even shown up in block explorer.<br />Did they transfer to SR soon after they showed up at least, or did it still take some time? I really want to get my orders in!

				Damn thats annoying... I transferred some about 8-9 hours ago and they have yet to arrive. Good to know at least that there is a reason and the coins haven&#039;t been lost.

				I&#039;ve found that within 30 minutes of showing in BE that they will be in your SR account.<br />TradeHill is taking a bit to transfer too, now.
