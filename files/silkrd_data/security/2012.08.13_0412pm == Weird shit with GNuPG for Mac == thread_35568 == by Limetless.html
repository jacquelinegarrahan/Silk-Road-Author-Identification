				Ok so recently I have tried to import a couple of peoples keys and whilst they import when I go to encrypt with them they don&#039;t come up on my list of keys to encrypt with. <br /><br />Any of you mother fuckers care to enlighten me on this annoying situation?

				To update does that mean I have to uninstall it and reinstall it and then import all my keys again and just have a long and drawn out day?

So. after perusing the forums here, I came across a very knowledgeable poster with the username &quot;Guru&quot; who suggested that people who have this problem download and install the &quot;nightly build&quot; version of GPG for Mac. (Google &quot;nightly build&quot; and GPG). The&quot;nightly build&quot; version of GPG is apparently a more advanced version of the software which overcomes some of the bugs in the standard version. Downloading and installing the &quot;nightly build&quot; version should solve your problem (just as it did for me).
