				Law enforcement, I really hope your here. I hope you&#039;re reading this. I hope CIA analysts are processing this forum, as quickly and diligently as I am, as a hyperpower--whether digital intelligence or human villain--may be doing now (and we would be none the wiser).<br /><br />The duty of law enforcement is to protect the people, to provide safety and security to the public. Now, to put what I am saying in context, consider the American Revolution. It was based on European men&#039;s intelligent design to protect ourselves and our children from tyranny, despots, and warlords. Americans, men and women with stake in this country, ultimately fought off the British with the help of the French (who were really only out for themselves when you look at Napolean and the Louisiana Purchase... which is strange why he is not compared to Hitler as often as he should be... but that problem was corrected with the French Revolution) and manipulation of Native Americans. The fight is ongoing.<br /><br />SR is an attempt to once again remove tyranny from the marketplace and from our lives. Corporations and corporate greed have replaced Kingdoms and Empires. Lawyers work within organizations to secure their interests, their ideals, and their greed. SR is the democratic answer to that.<br /><br />SR is democracy. It is piracy. It is independence.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe we should have a military presence in the Middle East. I believe Israel can stand on its own and survive--if it is willing to help instead of hurt its neighbors. Germany&#039;s Hitler raped the Jewish race, and now the Jewish race is raping the Arabs. They are taking resources, claiming &quot;Holy Land&quot;--natural resources disguised as religion--and exacerbating the already precarious human existence.<br /><br />I will use BTC and SR and every other cypher-world that is created heretofore. Japan has given the world the next gift that will define human history--and move us into a technological race for freedom and security--and it is our job to make sure that these efforts continue....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What does any of this have to do with a message to LE?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want to help LE make the world a safer place.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br /><br />LE: if you want the world be safer, then you have commit to making it smarter, which begins with yourself. Education. Push for education. The Kansas Report revealed how policing could be solved without hiring more police, but giving the police more intelligent approaches. Crimes typically happen where people aren&#039;t. Villains and warlords prefer to operate in the absence of crowds... Motels, forests, culdesacs.... More intelligent--and sometimes more violent... because those are the real bad guys... the violent ones... murderers... terrorists... Bad Guys....--criminals have now moved in to every home that has a WiFi. It will take too many resources to stop SR, much more than any War on Drugs will ever usurp from human civilization.<br /><br />No, SR needs a holistic approach, like the approach doctors take in medicine. Study the problem--the virus, cancer, aches and pains--just as any medical doctor would do. Follow the teachings of our enemies--those who wish to do us physical and social harm--and eradicate their existence.<br /><br />Eradication through Education.<br /><br />Police: help poor communities. Seek help from educators, policy makers. Look for the answers. Don&#039;t try and squash the bug, but instead, stop and think. Ask yourself what your job really is: safety and security of the American public. That means taking the steps to stop violence through social interactions. Get to know the people you are protecting. Gain their trust. Learn what it takes to develop community trust...<br /><br />We don&#039;t EVER wanna go back to the Wild West. We don&#039;t want to see weekly or daily hangings, to which the people of Iran and North Korea are subject. A democracy is everyone&#039;s voice... in unison... to make the world better. Stop ignorance.<br /><br />Niggas on the street corners are selling drugs because they don&#039;t have better options. Turn a &quot;nigga&quot; into a college professor by giving him incentives NOT to kill each other. Remove the violence by giving them incentives NOT to use violence. Remove the racism by removing the hatred. Remove the hatred by removing ignorance. Computer crimes don&#039;t hurt people. They might cause stress and social turmoil when things go wrong, but if you look at the banking corruption... Cyprus and Europe has broken out in violent protests. In America, we can kill the bankers, because we don&#039;t have Gun Control--an American tradition that will keep America alive through thick and thin.<br /><br />In the event that things do go back to the Wild Wild West (WWW), then America will be prepared. We have guns to protect ourselves in the event that social institutions break down. How many cops were strolling around during the Great Depression? The Great Depression was dominated by crooks and thieves, Al Capone and the Red Scare.... Followed by the Holocaust.... Hitler... Who got invaded? Those without guns. Who won? The ones with the most cunning and resources.<br /><br />Fuck. I&#039;m a die-hard American, willing to give my life for a better tomorrow, but I use drugs illegally. Help me be a patriot be legalizing drugs. I don&#039;t want the label of a criminal. The label sickens me, and I feel that the label in itself, encourages bad people to do bad things.

				No, wait. Sorry, I guess this is only for local cops. Federales are in the War on Drugs, so they are agents of death.<br /><br />War on Drugs: We will kill you if you the drugs don&#039;t.<br /><br />Sorry... I&#039;m still finding my way.

				While we actually live in a dystopia, I am always trying to find how to live in a utopia.... That&#039;s why I post all this &quot;shit&quot; here... because I need more sane people to straighten me out. A public discourse, or dialogue. If we lose that, then we will certainly fall under the rule of tyranny.

				The war on drugs is a FUCKING DISGRACE.<br />The education system concerning drugs is also fucking dismal.
