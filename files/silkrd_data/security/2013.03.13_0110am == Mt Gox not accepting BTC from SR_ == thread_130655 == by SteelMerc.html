				So, with the current value of BTC going down drastically, I decided to withdraw my BTC from my SR account to my Mt Gox wallet to convert them back to cash while I wait this whole debacle out.<br />Every time I try to do so, SR tells me that my Mt Gox address is invalid. I heard that Mt Gox stopped accepting transfers because of the v 0.8 error, but I would have thought that that was taken care of by now.<br />Am I wrong in assuming so? Is there some way to check the status of the whole BTC issue?<br />

				I don&#039;t see how SR could know that address belongs to MtGox, since Gox creates a new one after every deposit. It&#039;s never been used so it can&#039;t be connected to Gox.<br /><br />You usually see that error if the bitcoin address isn&#039;t copied completely, like if it&#039;s missing a few characters.<br />

				They disabled deposits yesterday during the block chain fork, but they should be accepting them now. Actually, the fact that you can see a deposit address means that they are accepting deposits. They can&#039;t tell other services not to send coins to them, especially since, as I said, other services won&#039;t know that those addresses belong to Gox. The only way for Gox to disable deposits is to not give you an address to send coins to.<br /><br />You can always transfer your coins to an ewallet and try to transfer to Gox from there.<br />

				Best one is&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/wallet/new<br /><br />Although instawallet.org is sufficient if you are transferring the coins there for a short amount of time.<br /><br />Don&#039;t lose the full Instawallet URL, though.<br />

				Awesome, thanks for the tips.<br />Went with Instawallet, transferred my money there and sent them to Gox about 30 mins ago.<br />Any idea how long it takes for your funds to finish transferring?

				It may only take a few hours for a Bitcoin transfer to go through, although if your transaction is low on the priority list, it could take much longer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve made Bitcoin transfers that took almost a day to show up at the destination address.
