				netherlands of course but how bout some other location in regards to the USA<br /><br />like what states do u think are the worst to order drugs from? <br />like bud.. or pills..<br /><br />like in florida its so easy to get pills <br /><br />i would think that hot spots like Denver, L.A., or humboldt county <br />would draw some more attention if you had packages sent regularly from them.<br /><br />really if you switch it up enough u should be fine<br />&nbsp;but it would be nice to see what you guys think.. <br /><br />

				I was wondering country wise as well. Is the UK to USA suspicious or Germany?<br /><br />I know china, india, Pakistan, are all hot spots. <br /><br />State to State is not much worry in my honest opinion as long as you switch things up like you said. FL is not such a pill hotspot anymore its moved into the midwest moreso now since they started cracking down on FL.

LOL<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sure. I wash drug documentaries excessively. I have received packages from the Netherlands, Germany, and India plus I had to SIGN for the product from India. After the first shipment, my heart pumped no Kool Aid.<br /><br />Now domestically, enforcement does not have time to check every package from a state that is SECOND in Fortune 500 company headquarters. It&#039;s just too much legit commerce and normally the bust is of a carrier, a private carrier. Not USPS, UPS, or FedEx.<br /><br />If your vendor cares anything about you or their business, the return address can be anything but where they are sending it from.<br /><br />Wherever I have lived, I learn the main industrial area/business park parts of the city, record names of companies and addresses for a return address situation.<br /><br />If it never makes it to the customer and it is never returns to me, then no one did the crime.<br /><br />Now, I will be transparent on one thing: I have yet to order green from Cali, or anywhere, for that matter. I believe I will get the nerve to do it next month. If not packaged properly, that smell does not need a drug dog to detect, lol. And I am not going down for doing someone else a favor because I don&#039;t even smoke like that.<br /><br />It&#039;s all business for me.

				I&#039;m surprised there aren&#039;t more successful shipping/receiving/reshipping services based around this notion.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you could figure it out, but I think alot of people would like to steer clear of customs.<br /><br />BTW, does anyone know how the postal system works when transferring between nations?<br /><br />for example, I pay my government to deliver a letter by buying stamps - but then when it goes to the other country, they have to take the responsibility of delivery.&nbsp; Is there some sort of agreement between all nations postal services?<br /><br />
