				One piece I&#039;m not reading is how you get your cash in your dwolla account to be cash without giving up your bank account number.&nbsp; How do I anonymously get the money in my dwolla account to become cash in hand?

				Dwolla &gt; Mt. Gox isn&#039;t really recommended as Dwolla have changed policy and Mt. Gox will cooperate with LE. Most people around here will agree to use an exchanger like Bit-instant or find a good MP &gt; BTC exchanger that isn&#039;t going to kill you with fees!<br />

They offer transfers of money between places like Dwolla and by bank deposits. They don&#039;t convert to bitcoins, they merely help you get the cash to an exchange. So they can replace Dwolla by bank deposits, or they can transfer money between your Dwolla and Mt.Gox accounts which is preferred since the changes to Dwolla&#039;s terms (however they charge a commission which was more than directly transferring between D and M without BI).

				bro,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;before giving info make sure you know what your taking about. bitinstant does too offer both! its called cash deposit to bitcoin email. you deposit the money no id needed. they send you a link to coinapult which takes an extra 1% but they they can turn you cash into bitcoins but your looking at 4.49+$1 of the deposit amount and then 1% for coinapult.&nbsp; so say with $490 you will get $462 in bitcoins.&nbsp; So considering that is what $30 bucks for over 90btc depending on the rate. well with alot of vendors they want anywhere from $1 per btc on this amount and on large amounts maybe $.50 to 75 cents if your lucky. yeah i have used them once and it was a test run but i want to build up to larger orders!<br />your welcome bro
