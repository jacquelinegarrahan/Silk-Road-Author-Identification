				I&#039;ve tried depositing cash through technocash to go to mtgox.&nbsp; So far no luck and proving to be a long difficult process.&nbsp; Luckily I only put in $100 to see how it works.&nbsp; If I put in $1000 i&#039;d be shitting bricks.&nbsp; Very frustrating though when you know what you want to order but can&#039;t get the bloody funds there.&nbsp; If I manage to get it through, I&#039;ll let you know&nbsp; :)

				I wasn&#039;t far off depositing to Technocash either, so I&#039;m glad that I read this thread just in time!<br /><br />Hopefully there&#039;s an easy option.

				ukash is available at any epay locations in oz so my method from the other thread should work for you, heres a copy and paste<br /><br />i came up with this for myself as i have no bank account and wanted a way to turn cash into btc, it may be a bit roundabout but itll work and allow you to change good old cash/card into btc in a matter of 10 mins or so, heres what you need to setup:<br /><br />setup an account at netteller<br />setup an account and avatar on second life<br />setup an account on virwox<br /><br />done that? good good, now on with getting that cash converted, we could take the netteller step out and use paysafe card to fund virwox instead but theres a shocking 20% charge for funding by paysafe and being a penniless bum i dont like spending where i dont have to, netteller transfers are only a 3.5% fee, so now<br /><br />head to your local shop that supports paypoint/payzone/epay and buy a ukash voucher for the amount you want, pay with your card or cash or whatever means the shop accepts/you choose, go home and load the ukash onto your netteller account, now load the netteller balance to your virwox account, you should now have the amount shown in your virwox account, now you need to sell that currency on the market for SLL$, then sell your SLL$ for BTC and youre home free (market transfers are instant) just remember to clean your coins after, especially if you used your cc to buy them

				Thanks heaps for that, prof! Very informative. <br /><br />I&#039;d set up all of the accounts this morning, then while I was out just earlier I went to a place that has an epay station. I asked to buy a Ukash voucher, but she couldn&#039;t seem to find it on the machine! I just found out there&#039;s another store just up the road from my house, so hoping that this place might have a smarter attendant. Do you know what menu they have to look under?&nbsp;

				Relax fellahs, Technocash pull through. Just make sure you put in the correct reference code when making the transfer so they know which Mt Gox account to credit.<br /><br />The longest it took for me was 2 days.

				I believe MT Gox have and Aus NAB account. They say it only takes 3-4 days to reach them. Surely that&#039;s the easiest way to get the money in.

				It&#039;s been a week and still no bitcoins&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; I&#039;ve e-mailed mtgox plenty of times with no response.&nbsp; Technocash confirmed they&#039;ve sent the funds to mmtgox but still nothing.&nbsp; Mtgox is fucked if u ask me because no one returns your e-mails.

				@bustercraig<br />I&#039;m new to this as well. However, I believe what happens is you transfer your bitcoins from mt. gox to your wallet on your home computer. then from there you transfer the bitcoins to SR. once the bitcoins hit your wallet they are anonymous and untraceable.

				i&#039;ve got a similar concern..<br /><br />i&#039;ve just signed up with tradehill and went to deposit funds but it is asking for my name and email address. do people use real info at this point?<br /><br />I guess i&#039;m a little concerned about associating my real name with my throw-away email address that I used to sign up with tradehill?<br /><br />any advice or tips would be most welcome...

				I&#039;m still scratching around trying to find a good way to go about this. The best option looks like what profspud posted about the Ukash vouchers, but every time I&#039;ve gone to ask for them at the places listed on the site, the operator doesn&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about!&nbsp; <br /><br />Just used Bitpiggy, but was only able to do $50 worth, and I&#039;m not even sure if I&#039;ll use those coins when they come through because the money was straight from my account (which I want to avoid... But I&#039;m getting a bit frustrated and let my guard down).

				find someone who has mined bitcoins on an australian computer forum and buy them. there is no history to those coins and imho the safest way to use sr.
