				Hey fellow SR members, I am looking to secure my computer and keep it without any traces&nbsp; of my naughty dealings here on SR.&nbsp; Problem is i am not great at all of this, so i was hoping someone could help me out with an easy way to secure my Mac. I know there are alot of other threads about this kind of stuff but i didnt see much specifically for Macs.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Main Goal:<br />-Looking to have my mac secure and traceless of anything to do with SR<br />-Easy step by step guide would be really perfect for me, and im sure there are some others in my predicament.<br /><br />Any responses are greatly appreciated!!!!!

				There is PGP whole disc encryption for MAC, very similar to TrueCrypt, but it&#039;s closed source and non-free. This is still the best option for MAC as far as I know.<br /><br />Or maybe use some LiveCD distro when dealing on Silk Road.

				You still need to encrypt the operating system to prevent possible leaks of data. External drives can be encrypted with TrueCrypt on MAC, but the OS must be crypted too. I will not trust the VileFault.

				It&#039;s pretty easy to burn liberte onto a disk that is bootable on your mac. Then just use ONLY that to access SR.If you&#039;re just buying, liberte will do everything you need, and has some handy security features. If you want a USB option, be prepared to devote hours or days to trying to configure it and get it to boot. Macs were never built with that in mind apparently. It is doable though. I&#039;ve heard there&#039;s a way to setup a VM on a truecrypted partition that turns all the other drives to read-only while it runs. That&#039;d be handy, who knows if it still leaks data though. <br /><br />If you&#039;ve already compromised your machine by running Tor and accessing SR etc, it&#039;s probably prudent to save the files you want and do a secure restore.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				How do you burn liberte onto a disk that can boot on a mac?&nbsp; I checked the liberte website and I don&#039;t see any mention of mac only windows and linux - http://dee.su/liberte-install&nbsp; I really want to do this.&nbsp; Maybe someone can point me in the right direction?

				Don&#039;t mind the part about it not mentioning mac, it works.&nbsp; <br /><br />Download the iso.<br />Insert a blank disc.<br />Start Disk Utility.<br />From the File menu, choose Open Disk Image and select the ISO to be burned.<br />In the list of volumes, you will now see an item representing the ISO file. Select it.<br />Click the Burn button and follow the instructions.<br /><br />Once it&#039;s done, put the cd in, restart your machine, and hold down the &#039;c&#039; key. Piece of piss right!? :)

				I wanted to do this SO BAD! I was going to create a seller&#039;s acct this week and start slinging my methadone but I can&#039;t even get PGP to operate on my mac. Now I&#039;m seeing all this stuff about encrypting the whole machine and I&#039;m guessing I should just leave well enough alone, huh? I am totally lost when it comes to all this stuff. That&#039;s the reason I bought a mac in the first place- so I could use my machine and it would work without blue screening every 6 months. I&#039;ve had this computer a long time and have loved it until I started trying to do all this. Anybody have any advice? How can I find someone that can help me with this?

				So I got into Liberte after downloading the iso and burning it to a disk.&nbsp; The first two times I started booting up it went to a black screen with a white line in the top left corner.&nbsp; The third time I got in. I can&#039;t get the web browser midora (sp?) to connect to my wireless network.&nbsp; I&#039;m so close...&nbsp;

				This thread is great!&nbsp; Thanks Nikodym for spelling that out for me.&nbsp; I still can&#039;t get midori to pick up my wireless signal.&nbsp; I&#039;m starting to think its better to try a wired connection. lol

				Nice thread! My question might be interesting to you too!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using my Mac to access Tor and SR the last few days. How can I delete all evidence of me accessing Tor? Is deleting TorBundle, emptying trashbin and then reinstalling the OS enough? Probably not! How do I wipe all evidence? Thanks in advance!

				Whoah.&nbsp; Thanks for all the info in this thread.&nbsp; New to SR and to Mac as well...this whole security thing was way over my head. I just sunk the cash into the Symantic Whole Disk encryption, and a few other PGP encrypt programs for messaging.&nbsp; Now I feel totally secure.&nbsp; Thanks for all the help people!

				it&#039;s worth noting it&#039;s almost impossible to be &#039;traceless&#039; with just an encryption of a HDD or files. The most important thing to get is, chances are if you have police accessing your computer you&#039;re already in a heap of shit. You can hide your SR activity but not the fact you&#039;ve used tor or an encryption program (again this is for methods of casual encryption). Your best defense is not getting to the point where your house is compromised. Put most of your effort into that.

				I&#039;m glad to see others are having trouble with this and im not the only who isnt a computer wiz. <br /><br />Okay so definitely some great info here!<br /><br />About liberte, so it sounds like its not that hard, just burn it as an iso, pop it in and start it up?&nbsp; Then just everytime i want to access SR just pop the disk in and do that? That definitely seems do&#039;able, am i missing something?<br /><br />Also, i have just acquired truecrypt. I apologize for my ignorance but now that i have truecrypt how do i go about using it? Idk could someone give me instructions?&nbsp; i really want to do this right and not let it be a waste.&nbsp; I think i gotta create a truecrypt container, but how big is it suppose to be, it ask mbs, gbs, am i trying to encrypt the whole computer or just certain stuff?&nbsp; Please help!!!<br /><br />What we really need is some tutorials for mac users like myself, who are a bit clueless lol.<br /><br />Thanks everyone

				Okay so Re: the topic of truecrypt, okay i now know how to create a drive, mount it, use it, unmount it(it disappears and cant be accessed w/o password) okay great. But im not sure what it is i want to put in that truecrypt container, do i put tor in there, my whole HD, or what? At the moment i only have a few gigs open.&nbsp; If i dont need to encrypt everything i rather not, just the necessary shit. And where does having truecrypt stand on the security scale? <br /><br />Actually that is a good question seperate from my truecrypt adventure.&nbsp; Could someone maybe list the features of a system with maximum security and perhaps a few levels under what would be required for maximum security, like the minimum security you should have?
