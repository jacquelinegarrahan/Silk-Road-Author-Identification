				I am looking for a secure email site to use, TOR mail is fucked up and doesn&#039;t work with BST very well, I was using hushmail, but I didn&#039;t sign in within 3 weeks and my account got deactivated. So what email service do you use besides TORmail? Thanks<br /><br />Regards,<br />i push the kush

				You can register a yahoo account with TOR. I mean it&#039;s fucking Yahoo but it&#039;s TOR so basically you have options depending on what you need it for, if it&#039;s a one time burner email you can try www.mailinator.com.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				In the tor bundle there is the checkbox option that your isp is against using tor, or something like isp must not know I use tor.<br /><br />ISP&#039;s blocking the net are lame. I guess I&#039;m lucky here since they only blocked the piratebay on some major isp&#039;s and that was because they were forced to do so after going to trial to explain that they don&#039;t want to. And that it&#039;s the beginning of blocking more and more.<br /><br />The funny thing is that you can still use tor to get on the piratebay which made banning it completely useless.

Safe-Mail is little better than Hushmail; the only real difference is that Hushmail uses PGP, and Safe-Mail uses S/MIME.&nbsp; Both services have access to one&#039;s private key(s). <br /><br />3. I read some accounts by Safe-Mail users some while back, where Safe-Mail was having technical difficulties.&nbsp; Some users became alarmed when their accounts suddenly sported copies of emails that they had previously deleted. (Obviously, Safe-Mail must have restoared these from backups.) <br /><br />If you MUST use a service like Safe-Mail, then you must ensure to use Tor to keep them from harvesting your IP addresses, and you also must ensure that all your email is PGP-encrypted BEFORE it ever hits the Safe-Mail servers. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

There are use cases for clearnet email providers, and Safe Mail is one of the few that allows you to register over Tor.<br />

When the Feds come along and demand your data, the provider has two basic choices: <br /><br />* Knuckle-under and hand-over your data; or<br /><br />* Lawyer-up, and fight &#039;em in court<br /><br />Sadly, even well-heeled companies with lots of lawyers like Microsoft and Yahoo! have chosen the first option.&nbsp; Companies like Twitter, which chose the second option, are far more rare. Even in Twitter&#039;s case, where it refused to hand over the data of users like Birgitta Jonsdottir, and fought the Feds in court for 18 months, they still lost in the end and had to hand over the data. Furthermore, most companies reserve the right to change their privacy policies with little (if any) notice to the userbase. <br /><br />As long as you&#039;re using SquirrelMail (i.e. no Javascript)&nbsp; the TorMail administrator should not be able to find out who you are.&nbsp; In any case, regardless of which email provider you eventually end up using, your email should be both encrypted and anonymized, so the authorities can neither read your email nor collect metadata/conduct traffic analysis. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

				Thanks for the info, Nightcrawler!<br /><br />Maybe policy was the wrong word for it. I get your point that whatever a provider writes about his policies most probably becomes irrelevant in a worst-case scenario.<br />Ill try to explain it better. What Im looking for is a provider that gives you information on how the input data is processed (logins, meta, text, contacts). Not actually where and how data is stored etc...<br /><br />I am very interested in encryption and data security, but Im also very new to the whole topic, so forgive me if Im asking bullshit :)
