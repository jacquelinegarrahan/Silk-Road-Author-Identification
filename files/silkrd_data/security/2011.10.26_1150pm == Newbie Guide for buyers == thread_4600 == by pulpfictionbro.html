				I thought it would be nice to have a one place guide for newbies that describes everything from buying bitcoins (BTC) to accepting deliveries. I know the SR Buyers guide covers most aspects but i thought there might be some additional information worth mentioning.<br /><br />To newbies, it took me about 2 weeks before i could place my first order on SR so please be patient. If you just &quot;discovered&quot; Silk Road (SR) and think you can make a purchase on Day One it wont happen. For starters you should have Tor up and running (you can read this so obviously you are) and should have read the following guides,<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide<br /><br />Now on to the actual guide. The guide is split up into 5 sections covering the major areas, there is also a &quot;tinfoil-tip&quot; at the end of each section which is for those who are extra paranoid :) <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. Security - the most important step. Might take a long while to setup depending on your tech expertise but once setup you will rarely have to change anything<br />a) Tor browser package - google it, download it. Should be pretty simple to setup. <br /><br />b) Truecrypt - This helps you to create a secure partition on your hard drive (or an external drive) that can only be accessed with the right password and keyfile combination. Everything from the Tor browser package to your passwords and other illegal stuff should be moved into that partition. <br /><br />Go here to download it, http://www.truecrypt.org/. They have a pretty basic step by step walkthrough of how to set it up.<br /><br />c) GPG/PGP - ALWAYS encrypt any sort of communication between you and vendor (including shipping addresses). <br /><br />Read up here on how to setup GPG - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0 (credit to shepj)<br /><br />d) ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use a diff id/pass combination on all the darknet sites (also for your bitcoin purchasing). There have been numerous incidents of people getting phished and losing their BTC on SR or other sites.<br /><br />e) I also suggest that people use passpharses instead of passwords. A pass phrase would be &quot;i be doing drugz 123&quot; this password will be harder to crack than just a regular password. <br /><br />Tinfoil tip -You could create a portable OS on an sd card/usb drive that is Truecrypt encrypted. This way you just have to plug it in and you are good to go. I would also recommend keeping the keyfile on a different usb drive/card which you carry with you, so if you get busted you can just destroy that thumb drive and your partition will become inaccessible.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2. Shipping - How will you accept deliveries? Where will you accept them?<br />a) P.O. Boxes - If you can get hold of fake id&#039;s then this would be a viable option. Although dependability is greatly reduced because you are going out of your way to pick up stuff from a PO Box. <br /><br />This thread would be helpful for shipping tips, http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0<br /><br />Tinfoil-tip - Look into buying a business on the cheap and use the business name to accept deliveries. I haven&#039;t researched this option very well so you are on your own if you decide to go this way.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. Communicating and other stuff - This is pretty elementary and should come naturally to most however some buyers keep on PM&#039;ing sellers and asking needless questions that can be looked up on the interwebz.<br />a) Tormail - Its probably advisable to use a throwaway email address that you can use to sign up at different places. I would suggest Tormail since its pretty easy to setup. Go here to set it up -&nbsp; http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/<br /><br />Special note - Tormail was recently hacked but only their homepage was compromised not the emails.<br />b) About drugs - To learn which drug to buy, what are its effects go to to www.erowid.org.<br /><br />c) Messaging - Use GPG always when communicating with vendors. Never giveaway any personal information or ask to buy/sell drugs in clear text.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. Buying - All the above steps lead to this. If you have performed steps 1-3 properly this step should be pretty easy.<br />a) Buying Bitcoins (BTC) - It is advisable that you dont start with an account that can be traced back to you i.e. dont use your credit card or checking account to buy bitcoins. Although there is nothing illegal about buying btc its still illegal to use btc to buy drugs so its safer that the bitcoins are untraceable to you. For that i recommend the following procedure,<br />STEP 1 - Find a vendor that accepts cash deposits<br /><br />STEP 2 - Buy BTC once the deposit clears. Remember when buying BTC you are concerned about the &quot;Bid&quot; price, buyer will bid for BTC&#039;s at a specific rate and if your bid price matches the &quot;Ask&quot; price of a buyer your order will be executed.<br /><br />STEP 3 - Transfer BTCs in chunks to a temporary wallet either on your computer or at www.instawallet.org. (IMPORTANT!! - If using instawallet write down addresses of all the wallets that you are using in case of network outage)<br /><br />STEP 4 - Once BTC reaches your temporary wallet send to it to more temporary wallets.<br /><br />STEP 5 - Transfer from the last temporary wallet (or wallets) to SR.<br /><br />Example, Bought 10 BTCs at exchanger, transferred 6 BTCs to Instawallet One, 4 BTCs to Instawallet Two. Send 2 BTCs from Instawallet One to Instawallet Three, 4 BTCs to Instawallet Four and so on. Ultimately, Instawallet N will send the money back to SR.<br /><br />b) Placing an order - Before you place an order research the product and the seller. Is the seller dependable? Has he been around for a long time? I usually sort products based on seller rank and then place an order with the higher ranked sellers. If i am placing an order with a new vendor then i take a look at the &quot;Rumor mill&quot; forum (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=7.0) to see if the seller is legit or not. If the seller is new then its advisable to place an order for small quantities before trusting the seller.<br /><br />Also, ALWAYS encrypt your shipping address when placing an order. <br /><br />c) Escrow - This is a hot topic amongst sellers and buyers alike. My stance on this is that if the seller is very highly rated and you have done business with him/her in the past then you can try going out of Escrow. However, by default i suggest NEVER NEVER go out of escrow. <br /><br />d) Finalizing order - Once the order arrives its important that you finalize the order in SR by going to your orders and clicking the &quot;finalize&quot; button for the appropriate order. You can leave the feedback before you try the product and you can always go back in and update your feedback once you have tried it. I generally never finalize early because finalizing early is essentially going out of Escrow.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5. Feedback - Feedback is an important aspect and a responsible buyer should leave timely, clear and concise feedback. I use the following scale for feedback,<br />1 pt for Shipping - Timely shipping and arrival<br />1 pt for Service - Quick and prompt communication (2-3 days, may vary for busier sellers)<br />1 pt for Packaging - Was it secure? Was the product showing through? <br />1 pt for Product - This is important. You cannot expect A-class weed for dirt prices and vice versa so rate the product on value for money.<br />1 pt for overall - If the first 4 were good then this is an automatic 1 pt. <br /><br />If there were problems with the order then use your best judgement to leave feedback. I have seen people leave a 5/5 if the seller offered a reasonable settlement.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That covers all of it! If there are any questions feel free to ask me or post them in one of the forums.<br /><br />Quick links <br />WARNING! -&nbsp; Any of the following links could change to phishing links. I have posted these links in complete honesty and they are completely safe as far as i am concerned. However please use your own discretion.<br /><br />1. Learn about drugs - www.erowid.org<br />2.
