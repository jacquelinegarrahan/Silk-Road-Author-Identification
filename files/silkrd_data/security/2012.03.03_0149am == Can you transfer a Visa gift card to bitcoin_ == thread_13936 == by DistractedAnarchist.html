				Hey guys I&#039;m new here, haven&#039;t made a purchase yet. From what I understand you need to find a way to transfer your country&#039;s currency to Bitcoin. I have no credit card so I was wondering if a Visa gift card would work. And if so what would I have to do to transfer it. Any information would help. Thanks so much. <br />PS. I&#039;m also having a hard time understanding PGPs. Do I post my private or public PGP? And when do I post it? Thanks very much!&nbsp; ;D

And search the forum, there&#039;s a ton of guides for PGP on here, and on youtube. NEVER give away your private key, thats why its called the PRIVATE key. Remember to include your public PGP key when sending an encrypted message to someone for the first time so they have your key to encrypt the response. To create a PGP message use notepad/gedit or whatever you use as a basic word processor, once the message is complete save it and encrypt the actual .txt(or whatever extension) file using the PGP application you are using. There should be a check box saying something allong the lines of &quot;output file in Armor&quot; or just &quot;Armor&quot;, make sure thats checked or your encryption output will be gibberish and unusable. Once u do that just open the file the PGP application outputed during encryption and copy/paste all of the text inside the file (including -------PGP Message------). When receiving a PGP message, copy/paste the PGP Message (all the text) into a blank text document, save it, open up the PGP application, decrypt the file, most likely will ask for your key password. It will output the un-encrypted message in regular text for you to read.
