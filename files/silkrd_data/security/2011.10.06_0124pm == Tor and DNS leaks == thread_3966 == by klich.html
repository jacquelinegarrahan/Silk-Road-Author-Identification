				There&#039;s one thing I do not understand about Tor and DNS leaks:<br /><br />does it apply only to applications you want to anonymize?<br /><br />To put it simply, If I browse SR with Tor and use my usual browser for normal sites, and additionally download torrents with uTorrent AT THE SAME TIME, is my Tor security compromised?

				There were about 5 answers to this before, and now they are all deleted.. what gives? I swear this place is glitching hard or possibly compromised. <br /><br />Anyways to repeat my answer from before (can remember what others said, but there was some good advice)... Go download and install Proxifier. Preferably in Sandboxie or a VirtualBox, but if you want to just on your regular OS. Be aware though, if you install it on your raw OS, all the traffic of all apps is proxified through tor. This is why its ideal for Sandboxie or VirtualBox. The upside is that it has an option for remote DNS, so all DNS will be forced through tor.
