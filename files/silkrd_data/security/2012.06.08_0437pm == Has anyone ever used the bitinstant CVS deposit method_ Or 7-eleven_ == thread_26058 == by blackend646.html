				Bitinstant recently got a new option to deposit money through stores such as CVS, 7-eleven and wal-mart. Has anyone successfully tried this? The people at my local banks are starting to sketch me the fuck out. <br /><br />If anyone has experience with this, I printed out the zipzap payment slip, do I just go to CVS and bring it to the cashier, and then fill out the information accordingly just like a bank deposit slip?<br /><br />Bank deposits are instant and I usually have my coin waiting for me when I get home, does that hold true for this method as well?

				Your comment about the local banks is beginning to ring true with me as well. (Small town, impossible to choose from dozens of branches to reduce patterns/suspicions).<br /><br />I&#039;m about to give the Walmart option a try. No matter what location you choose, you are basically using Moneygram to wire your cash to ZipZapCash, who then forwards your cash to Bitinstant. Lots of ways to get your coins too on the receiver side: btc in email via coinapult, mtgox codes, you can even have them sent directly to a wallet address. The fees seem reasonable as well. We shall see...<br /><br />- eb 8)

				Yo, Blackend. I just want to say that I had the same fright today too when I tried to deposit through a Chase branch. I asked and she said there is an alert on the account and that it didn&#039;t say why.<br /><br />She did ask me why I was trying to do this and what &quot;my connection to all of this was.&quot; I told essentially told her some bullshit and to fuck off and she gave me my money back and I left.<br /><br />Sorry guys, looks like those greedy, devilish motherfuckers at JP Morgan finally caught on.

				I&#039;ve never tried to do it at the bank because I read somewhere it could take over a day. But using the bit instant and moneygram ATM payment method didnt really come off as a problem to give my info as long as the payments were being deposited to mtgox. But why would the banks or bank be so suspicious about a currency exchange?

				I did the CVS/moneygram/email transfer yesterday.&nbsp; Went smooth as silk.&nbsp; Print out the zipzap form and take it to the store.&nbsp; You have to use the in house moneygram phone to &quot;register&quot; the payment.&nbsp; They ask for all kinds of info, but they don&#039;t verify it - just give some fake bullshit.&nbsp; Once you &quot;register&quot; the bill payment with moneygram, take it to the cashier, and tell them you are paying a bill - not sending money.&nbsp; And MAKE SURE you have the cashier/moneygram clerk&nbsp; &nbsp;register it for the entire zipzap amount (the $ amt of btc, PLUS the 3.95 zipzap fee).&nbsp; The cashier then rings up the sale and you 0pay with cash.&nbsp; By the time you get home, there will be a confirmation email waiting for you.&nbsp; Bitinstant uses coinapault to transfer the btc to whatever wallet you want.&nbsp; It then took about 2 hrs for the btc to show up in my wallet.<br /><br />I was placing a large order, and I shorted myself by about .25btc......I was pissed!!&nbsp; So here are all the fees you will pay:&nbsp; bit instant commission, the zipzap 3.95, and a 1% fee to coinvault.&nbsp; So just plan accordingly and add a little extra.<br /><br />It worked just perfectly.&nbsp; After being scammed by a btc vendor, the peace of mind was well worth it!!

				Did CVS for the first time yesterday, just as simple and easy as doing it at a bank.<br />They ask you to put down your name and address when you fill out the moneygram forum, even if you do cash. I was frazzled so I (stupidly) put my real name down. Looking back I bet you can just put down a fake name and address. The only reason you would need it to be a real one is if there was an issue with the transfer and you wanted to claim you money.<br /><br />The coins were in coinapult by the time I got back home.<br /><br />

				After placing an order for coins at Bitinstant, I did the &quot;Cash&gt;CVS&gt;Moneygram&gt;ZipZapCash&gt;BitInstant&gt;mywallet&quot; method last night. When you place the order online, the website pops up a custom made transfer slip to print and take to Moneygram. I had to use a red telephone next to the photo kiosk inside CVS. You pick it up and it automatically dials a Moneygram rep. They ask for the receive code and account number that is listed on the slip provided by bitinstant. You are actually sending the cash to a company called ZipZap, a bill pay service that serves many organizations outside the BTC community. ZipZap Cash forwards your payment to Bitinstant and the coins begin their journey to you. <br /><br />About the concerns folks have mentioned with regard to real names, IDs, etc. Here is how mine played out:<br /><br />Names? I gave a fake one. Phone numbers? Don&#039;t have a phone. Address? I gave a fake one. ID? I lost my ID. The fact is, I am making a bill payment, not receiving cash. The clerk at CVS didn&#039;t bat an eye when I gave these responses. I had btc in my SR wallet only 92 minutes after my cash was rang up at the register inside CVS. After all fees, my exchange rate came to 5.864. Not too shabby...<br /><br />- eb 8)

I believe the Moneygram-Bill Pay service is marketed to those who can&#039;t get/don&#039;t have a bank account and therefore have difficulty paying bills like cell phones, elec/gas bill, long distance etc. These Moneygram phones are in 70,000 locations nationwide to reach a wide audience. When I lived back in Tejas, a lot of folks from ,eh hmm, south of the border, would use them in 7-11&#039;s to send money back home. It&#039;s a pretty handy service for a lot of different reasons. Looks like it is handy for one more reason now.<br /><br />I&#039;m buying a fake beard and thick glasses like Charles Nelson Riley&#039;s on my next visit just for fun.

				One more thing that adds to the convenience of this method is the variety of &quot;outputs&quot; the buyer can choose from. Not only can you get the money converted to a mt gox code or have a coinapult link sent via email, you can even have bitinstant drop the btc straight into a wallet address of your choosing.<br /><br />So yes, for those of you cavalier types who &quot;poo-poo&quot; the notion of additional coin washing prior to use, feel free to insert your SR wallet addy. Deposit cash at any CVS or Wal-Mart and coins arrive in your SR account like magic in minutes. Almost sounds too good to be true, but it worked like a champ.

				I know bitcoin isn&#039;t illegal, but neither are kitchen knives. Using a kitchen knife to disembowel your enemies and feast on their hearts to gain their strength, however, is illegal. Using bitcoin to buy drugs online is, for some reason, also illegal. <br /><br />With that in mind, I just like to be extra cautious about my process of getting coins onto SR.

				Using TOR to access bitinstant isn&#039;t necessary, but I&#039;m quite sure you can do it without an issue. You can use either your tor address or your real one, but I would use your tormail personally. Not sure about that last one

You have to decide 2 things - how you want to put money in and how you want to get bitcoins out.<br /><br />&nbsp;I personally like paying through a deposit at a bank because they ask less questions and you don&#039;t have to screw around with any forms or cashiers but you can also pick out another source. I&#039;ve used Wal-Mart before and it worked fine, you just fill out a form with fake info and how much money you&#039;re depositing then hand it and cash to a clerk. At a bank you just hand them a piece of paper you print off and the cash. So its really up to you. <br /><br />Then you get to pick where you want it to pay to. I&#039;ve been using MtGox, but MtGox is getting rather non-anonymous so it might be better to just send the coins to a wallet without going through them.&nbsp; There are other options, and if you feel like it go ahead and experiment with them. So now just pick whatever options you want in the drop down list. <br /><br />Then just fill out the form. Its kinda self-explanatory, but the destination account is where you want the coins to go -- if you picked MtGox put in your account # from there, if you picked a wallet put in the wallet address. Below that type in how much you want to put in, and remember that BitInstant and the companies they work with all take commissions so you may want to add more than you want to receive. Like if&nbsp; I was getting $50 I&#039;d put in $55 to make sure I had enough afterwards to buy a $50 product on here.&nbsp; Also throw in an email address to be notified at when your payment is processed. <br /><br />Then click Send Funds. You&#039;ll be presented with a table summing up your order, and once you agree that it all looks good click go. It will forward you over to either ZipZap or TrustCash. These are the dudes that take the money and give it to BitInstant who then give you coins. This page will automatically load banks or stores that are closest to you and will accept your deposit. Pick whichever one you want by clicking &quot;Choose Location&quot; next to it. It will ask you for an email address and present you with the exact total you have to deposit, make sure to have that exact amount and the change in hand when you go to deposit at the bank. <br /><br />Click the big green button that says Create Invoice and print it out. Then take the invoice and the money to the bank you picked and follow the directions on it. Within a couple hours at most your coins will be in your wallet. If you chose the MoneyGram(7-11,Wal-Mart,CVS) method then its basically the same. You just have to fill out a form with information off the invoice at the location or use a phone if you&#039;re going to CVS. <br /><br />So Summary:<br />-Stick your info into BitInstant, select how you want to put money in and get coins out. <br />-Fill out their form and follow the directions on the payment pages<br />-Take cash and invoice to Bank or Store and give them cash<br />-Wait a little bit and you&#039;ve got coins!<br />

				Great info here. I&#039;ve got one quick question, does the CVS method cost a bit extra as Moneygram is inserted into the process? From what I&#039;m gathering in this thread, it seems going to a bank seems like the least hassle. That is of course excepting the banks in smaller towns that may become aware of your trending habits.<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna go drop a good amount of cash today, probably at the BofA, to buy my first batch of bitcoins. Can&#039;t wait. Now on to the vendor/product review threads...

				They aren&#039;t exactly sure of when it will be up again, they are &quot;waiting to hear from&quot; chase. They assured that the problem will be resolved though, and seem confident it will only be a couple more days at the most. Here&#039;s to hoping it&#039;s fixed by Saturday evening.

				I just wanted to jump on this thread.&nbsp; I did a Bitinstant transfer via MoneyGram to Coinapult then xferred that to my Bit Wallet and then xfer to here.&nbsp; For a $3.95 fee, I found this to be a great bargain, considering you are using the &#039;blue express moneypak&#039; form which makes the transfer in under 10 minutes.&nbsp; I went to WalMart, paid in cash, used a fake name, address and #.&nbsp; No ID needed to send under $900 (according to the MoneyPak terms on the front) so if a clerk asks and you&#039;re doing under $900, point that out to them.<br /><br />I got home 15 minutes later and the email code was in my Inbox waiting....no issues whatsoever.&nbsp; <br /><br />Very simple.&nbsp; The clerk at WalMart was amazed that there was NO FEE associated with this express transfer....she said &quot;that&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve ever seen that happen&quot;.<br /><br />

				I was really hoping they would have Chase deposits up and running again by now. I may have to try something different this time. I&#039;m slightly more inclined to try Bank of America rather than CVS at this point, they don&#039;t ask for your personal information at all? <br /><br />Have any of you done both Chase and Bank of America?

				I used bitinstant for the first time today and it was great.&nbsp; I just took my printed invoice to a local bank and had my coins in the afternoon (i had the coin sent straight to a new address i created over TOR, rather than doing coinapult).&nbsp; I was using dwolla--&gt;mtgox for the past few months but had to change up my game now that mtgox is getting all snitchy.&nbsp; plus, it was stupid to be buying bitcoin with a trail to my bank account, even if its perfectly legal.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried a few days ago to use bitinstant via CVS, but got a bad feeling about it.&nbsp; not a rational bad feeling, but I just didn&#039;t like it...they pointed me to this red phone that i didn&#039;t want to touch for hygienic reasons, but did, and then the recording was asking if i was sending to a person or paying a bill and I didn&#039;t know which one to pick, so i just hung up and left.&nbsp; my experience today at the bank was a breeze and much more hygienic.<br /><br />after that, I can&#039;t believe I was actually considering using one of the moneypak--&gt;btc vendors on silk road.&nbsp; their fees are enormous and you are at their complete mercy to not get ripped off.&nbsp; really glad i just tried bitinstant again

				Yeah, I would have to get pretty damn desperate to do moneypak for those same reasons.

				Thanks a lot spacewasp. Just got back from BoA a few minutes ago, I have to say that was the most painless bitcoin purchase I&#039;ve made so far. Filled out the slip which asks the same information as Chase, gave them the money and was out of there in 2 minutes. No personal information at all, and they didn&#039;t ask me what it was for like they sometimes do in Chase. <br /><br />Funds were in my coinapult 5-10 minutes after I got home. <br /><br />Happy Saturday everyone :)

				It&#039;s strange that they said that. The tellers don&#039;t take the invoice, it&#039;s literally just a piece of paper with the account number and name on it and how much you are supposed to deposit. Most of the time I end up filling out the slip at the bank myself. I don&#039;t really see what the issue would be with simply writing the information down, unless you write it wrong anyway

				I tried using Moneygram at CVS today (None of the banks Bitinstant works with are near me) and had a weird experience. I went through the whole deal with the red phone, that was easy, no problem. I used a fake name and address and told them I didn&#039;t have a phone. They finally told me I was ready to complete the transaction and hung up and I went to the desk. I went through the transaction, paid the money, and when it was about to print my receipt and be over, the employee got an error message saying they had to call moneypak. It ended it the whole thing just being cancelled and me getting my money back and leaving. I then tried creating a new slip with ZipZap through Bitinstant for a different CVS close by and the same exact thing happened there. Both times the employees were very confused, saying they had never seen this happen before. Anyone have any input on this? Should i just suck up the gas cost and drive out to BoA?

				Hey you guys I just found something.<br /><br />Like many of you, the only non moneygram option I thought I had was Chase.<br /><br />Click &quot;Other local locations&quot; under cash deposit.<br /><br />zipzap takes you to a little list of people in the area. Most of them are still money grams, but I was able to find a local credit union, and a grocery store, that can somehow accept payment using a system other than moneygram... might be worth further investigation.

				I tried using the Bitinstant/CVS method of acquiring bitcoins at a local CVS.&nbsp; I went to the red phone and got all the required information, but nobody at the store (including the manager) knew how to do the transaction and as a result couldn&#039;t make it go through.&nbsp; The next day I did a Bitinstant cash deposit at a local BofA which went without the slightest hitch.&nbsp; I may try this method again a few towns away where they get more people paying bills via Moneygram, but I know that it doesn&#039;t work in my little corner of the suburban tristate area.

				Still no Chase as of right now, for those who are still wondering.<br /><br />The Citibank and BoA options are just as easy and quick though. If you have the option to use those instead of Chase for the moment, do it.

				Hadn&#039;t seen this thread, so I just returned from Chase Bank about 30 minutes ago.&nbsp; Bitinstant didn&#039;t have Chase as an option for the deposit until I logged in and used a &quot;saved location.&quot;&nbsp; So I went to make the deposit and got hassled.&nbsp; They asked for ID (I didn&#039;t give it to them).&nbsp; They said the account was &quot;restricted.&quot;&nbsp; They gave me my money back and I left.&nbsp; Was a little stressful, though.<br /><br />I think Bitinstant is stringing us along.&nbsp; A few pages back in this thread, someone says Chase will be an option again by June 11th.&nbsp; I&#039;m staying away from Chase for the time being.<br /><br />Going to go to a Moneygram location through CVS this afternoon.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post my experience.

				CVS was easy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ordered through Bitinstant and chose &quot;other retail location.&quot;&nbsp; <br />That took me to ZipZap.com.&nbsp; <br />Was able to print off a bill that can be paid at any MoneyGram location.<br />Went to CVS.<br />Picked up the red phone.<br />Had to enter invoice info from my printoff.<br />Had some trouble entering the amount.&nbsp; Enter the whole dollars, then push *, then cents, then push #.<br />Gave them a fake name, address and phone number.<br />Went to the CVS counter and told them I needed to pay this overdue bill today.<br />Clerk asked if I was Mr. Dimmydummydummerdorf.&nbsp; I said yes.<br />She asked for my CVS rewards card - I declined<br />Gave her my cash.<br />Had to sign a receipt - scribbled it.<br />Given my receipt.<br /><br />When I got back to my office, a Bitinstant email was waiting.<br /><br />Now, I am waiting for the transfer to show up on SR.&nbsp; I like the fact that the printout says it is a bill payment.&nbsp; The lady at CVS didn&#039;t bat an eye.&nbsp; She seemed familiar with ZipZap, so maybe people use it regularly for bill payments.<br /><br />This is how I will fund my account from now on.&nbsp; Any moneygram location will do, so I can mix it up.

				Hey guys. I did the moneygram thru wal-mart recently, and did not get ID&#039;d... but then again the girl was kinda flirting with me. I had called the store beforehand to ask if they IDd and they said yes...<br /><br />Dislike this method because of the form you will out and the weird off chance a poorly trained employee will ID you to be safe.<br /><br />But... I found a better option. Cash deposit - other. Its the last listing in the cash deposit option. If you use this, bitinstant shows you a zipzap provided list of their providers. And there are a lot of banks, credit unions, and local yokel grocery stores that don&#039;t have cameras on this list!!!!! Just pick one that says &quot;softgate&quot; instead of moneygram. I found three new viable locations and none of them ask for ID. Its a simple and quick transaction that these locations do from a debit terminal. They use a service called cashpayment.com<br /><br />This is what ill be doing from now on.<br /><br />Btw the cash deposit &gt; wallet method works beautifully.

				Still no Chase as of 3:06PM EST 6/28/12.<br /><br />If BoA was a pain in the ass, I suggest trying Citibank if there&#039;s one nearby. Never had a problem with either, but Citi is definitely quicker and more professional.

				tried the bitinstant via moneygram this time at CVS, and the overly helpful associate got very strange with me, they didnt have a red/blue phone and wouldnt just give me a simple form, asked me if i was doing the transfer for myself or someone else. i told him myself and was told they didnt beleive me and thought i was doing it for someone else. this seemed a bit odd to me but i know im just sending some money so i told them id bring my business elsewhere, and he asked my name and address (which, naturally, i confused with a non-existant persona) and finally told me the money could not be sent because there was no recipient name to fill in. it was a bit sketch, but mostly just seemed like incompetence. i think the main problem with this method is... unintelligent counter workers. ive had a couple successful bitinstant transactions via bank cash deposit and id say stick with that method if possible. bankers take deposits all day but the cranky old man making minumum wage at the drug store may or may not know how to do it.

				Cash gets deposited to Mt.

				I just did a transaction through a 7-11 on Friday with bitinstant. I was pretty stoked because it was all automated at a machine... until I realized that the machine wouldn&#039;t take coins. Of course, after I put my money in and finished the transaction there I discovered that it also didn&#039;t GIVE coins back... so it sent the wrong amount.<br /><br />I emailed support, had to send my reciept/deposit slip, and had my coins today, even though it was the weekend, so definite plus to them! Next time I&#039;ll see if I can find a location with either a real person or a machine that accepts coins.

				<br /><br />How about you say nothing at all because it is none of there business and they don&#039;t give a fuck anyways. <br /><br />When you do a western union or a money gram, the cashier has no clue what the money you are sending is for or for that matter even going to. Especially when you use cash. 99% of time the cashier barley knows how to use the system. You are going to an employ who is paid minimum wage and is basically an idiot.<br /><br />If you happen to go to a check cashing place (that has a western union or money gram) and you are taking cash in to send it to someone... the LAST thing they care about is where the money is going. That is what their business is...to send and receive money. There are over 100k transactions a day going through those places in the USA alone.<br /><br />Also about 99.9999% of them have zero clue what BTC is! Just like even less of them know what SR is. So if you even tried to explain to them, they would be lost. Fuck, there are 100&#039;s in here that barley know how to use it!! ;)<br /><br />You are way better off just going in to those places and sending your money and keeping your mouth shut. As long as you don&#039;t act like an idiot in there you will be just fine.<br /><br />One thing to note is, when you are sending money you should never use the same phone number. Just like grocery stores, western union wants to keep track of there customers. Not for any reporting at all but to keep you coming to them and not the competition. They try and offer you loans,debit cards, frequent user cards ect. Again none of it is to to report you. It is just to keep track of there customers so they can offer better service or more of there bullshit products to.<br /><br />I would think 99% of you are always doing less then 1k since that is the limit without having to show ID. So lets say you send $900.00 then you go to another western union and send another $900.00. If you were to use all the same info such as names of receiver and sender that would be OK. The problem is if you use the same phone number...by problem ... I mean they will see you just sent $900.00 from another location. Again this is of course is not against the law and %99.999&nbsp; will ever say a thing. But there is always that cunt that can&#039;t help herself and will say something to you. Again what they say does not matter...but why have them say anything at all??? All you have to do is use a different phone number. Then they will never see anything, ever.<br /><br /><br />Realize there are 100&#039;s of thousands of people that use these services to send money on a daily basis to family and friends and to pay bills. You in no way stand out. But if you were to say send 5k in one day from the same location, that will raise an eyebrow. But if you are that stupid then you shouldn&#039;t be doing it in the first place. Again, there is no law being broken, but they are required to keep records if you spend more then $9999.99 in cash there. But none of you are doing that so no worries.<br /><br /><br />Just be smart people and not paranoid. Try not and go to these places all high. If you follow those 2 rules you will never ever have a problem.<br /><br />You should be a lot more paranoid of getting a speeding ticket on your way there&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Take Care!

				Hey guys, I&#039;ve got a question.&nbsp; I used CVS last Friday to send a moneygram/cash to my SR wallet.&nbsp; It&#039;s now Monday afternoon and I haven&#039;t got it.&nbsp; I quadruple checked my bitcoin address.&nbsp; I received the conformation from ZipZap saying that the payment was successful, but that was it.&nbsp; Has anyone had this happen or any ideas on what I should do?

				Maybe a little off topic, but a lot of folks in here have been asking about Mt. Gox. <br /><br />I strongly recommend staying away from there in the future. There have been several reports of people being locked out of their Mt. Gox accounts until they present photo ID, because they connected to it through TOR. <br /><br />The way I see it, if a company is nosy and intrusive enough to do such a thing, they are not to be trusted. I&#039;m pretty confident they would cooperate 100% with LE if prompted to do so. <br /><br /><br />Bitinstant --&gt; Coinapult(With a tormail address) --&gt; Silkroad seems to be a good method.

				I&#039;ve done this at Walmart twice in past 2 days. I put fake personal info down and pay cash. No questions asked. By the time I get home they&#039;re in my Mt.Gox acct. <br /><br />Trick is to pay cash, and if they do ask questions about your info, just pretend you&#039;re sending it for someone else. It&#039;s walmart, I doubt they give a damn who you send it to. <br /><br />They do ask for phone numbers(again i used a fake one), and on my second visit she tried looking up my info and asked me if I gave the right one. They I told her this was my first visit and she started from scratch and everything worked fine. I think they look up previous transactions from the phone number listed. Just give a fake name/number/address each time you should be golden.

				I did the Walmart method today. It couldn&#039;t have been easier. There wasn&#039;t a red phone so I approached customer service and asked for the form. The clerk had me fill it out and then the clerk input the info manually into the computer. I used completely fictitious info and no ID was needed. The clerk also didn&#039;t even bat an eye at the transaction and acted as if it was something they handle numerous times a day. All in all, I&#039;d say that if anyone is slightly paranoid about this method RXKing said it best -- you should be more worried about getting a speeding ticket on the way there than doing the transaction itself.<br /><br />On a side note, if you&#039;re very paranoid you can always go to an area that has a large Hispanic population. They do WU/MG transfers all the time to send money back home and as a result the clerks will have a lot more experience in handling these types of transfers. Essentially, I feel that is our biggest problem: some clerks get really confused by these transactions and, since we&#039;re all inherently paranoid to begin with, we tend to falsely misinterpret their ignorance for being suspicion. <br /><br />Good luck everyone.

				Got to agree with blackend646, because he is truly spot on. I myself have used bitinstant for all of my transfers and I have NEVER HAD A SINGLE ISSUE. I stay away from Chase as I just dont care for them, their customer service is simply lacking IMHO. I use Wells Fargo, and it is truly the best and easiest way to get your USD into BTC. When you go to Wells Fargo, all you have to do is grab a deposit slip, write down the account number and name, and the exact amount you are going to deposit (all of this information comes from the company that bitinstant uses for the transfer of cash funds) walk up to the teller and hand it to him/her along with your cash and 30 seconds later you will get a receipt confirming the deposit. As for myself, when I am outside the bank and walking to my car I simply call the phone number on the email that is sent to you with all the other info (account #, account name, exact amount of deposit, etc) and select option 1. A REAL person (an American, not some dude in a call center in India) answers the phone and you simply say &quot;I would like to confirm a deposit that I just made.&quot; The operator simply asks for the amount that was deposited, and simply confirms your selected transfer method, and less than a minute later you will receive another email stating that the funds have be confirmed and are ready for use. I personally think the best method to use is Coinapult. It is so very simple, as all you do is provide the email address you want to use and the Bitcoins are emailed to that account. From there you can send the BTC ANYWHERE you want. This obviously makes covering any digital footprints much easier, as you could spend as much (or as little) time you want sending the BTC to multiple locations before finally depositing it into your SR account. JUST PLEASE REMEMBER (FOR THOSE OF YOU STILL NEW TO ALL OF THIS): DO YOURSELF A HUGE FAVOR AND DONT DIRECTLY DEPOSIT THE BTC INTO YOUR SR ACCOUNT!!! ITS JUST NOT A GOOD IDEA, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS THAT ARE MUCH SAFER, AND JUST AS FAST (Coinapult). Just my two cents...<br />-arpeggi

In my closest store they have it sitting right next to the ATM. Another option would be on the zipzap cash checkout, choose your country and select your location, should pop up with some store locations that do have moneygram.<br /><br />Also I&#039;m going to assume from the lack of response to my question that I can go ahead with it anyway.

				When you do a western union or a money gram, the cashier has no clue what the money you are sending is for or for that matter even going to. Especially when you use cash. 99% of time the cashier barley knows how to use the system. You are going to an employ who is paid minimum wage and is basically an idiot.<br /><br />If you happen to go to a check cashing place (that has a western union or money gram) and you are taking cash in to send it to someone... the LAST thing they care about is where the money is going. That is what their business is...to send and receive money. There are over 100k transactions a day going through those places in the USA alone.<br /><br />Also about 99.9999% of them have zero clue what BTC is! Just like even less of them know what SR is. So if you even tried to explain to them, they would be lost. Fuck, there are 100&#039;s in here that barley know how to use it!! ;)<br /><br />You are way better off just going in to those places and sending your money and keeping your mouth shut. As long as you don&#039;t act like an idiot in there you will be just fine.<br /><br />One thing to note is, when you are sending money you should never use the same phone number. Just like grocery stores, western union wants to keep track of there customers. Not for any reporting at all but to keep you coming to them and not the competition. They try and offer you loans,debit cards, frequent user cards ect. Again none of it is to to report you. It is just to keep track of there customers so they can offer better service or more of there bullshit products to.<br /><br />I would think 99% of you are always doing less then 1k since that is the limit without having to show ID. So lets say you send $900.00 then you go to another western union and send another $900.00. If you were to use all the same info such as names of receiver and sender that would be OK. The problem is if you use the same phone number...by problem ... I mean they will see you just sent $900.00 from another location. Again this is of course is not against the law and %99.999&nbsp; will ever say a thing. But there is always that cunt that can&#039;t help herself and will say something to you. Again what they say does not matter...but why have them say anything at all??? All you have to do is use a different phone number. Then they will never see anything, ever.<br /><br /><br />Realize there are 100&#039;s of thousands of people that use these services to send money on a daily basis to family and friends and to pay bills. You in no way stand out. But if you were to say send 5k in one day from the same location, that will raise an eyebrow. But if you are that stupid then you shouldn&#039;t be doing it in the first place. Again, there is no law being broken, but they are required to keep records if you spend more then $9999.99 in cash there. But none of you are doing that so no worries.<br /><br /><br />Just be smart people and not paranoid. Try not and go to these places all high. If you follow those 2 rules you will never ever have a problem.<br /><br />You should be a lot more paranoid of getting a speeding ticket on your way there&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Take Care!<br /><br />

				I need some help unfortunately I don&#039;t have the time to go and do a few trial runs. I have to get about $2500 worth of coins and I would really rather not screw that up. So when I go to various places to deposit the money can anyone explain what you will have to write down on the slip in order to send the money to whoever to get the coins. I believe everyone says to send it to bitinstant, then after that what happens?? Do I then take that slip back home and put some sort of code into bitinstant to send the money to MTG? And then how would I go about scrambling the coins before I send them to the SR wallet. Should I download a wallet client to send them to after I get them on MTG, and then send them to my SR wallet? Any help would be great appreciated.

				Have had 3-4 successful runs at the local CVS using BitInstant. It&#039;s probably the best method for cash purposes, though I have not acquired btc any other way so there&#039;s that bias. It&#039;s gotten to the point where the Moneygram phone at the CVS remembers the fake name I use to pay a bill to ZipZap - cashier forced me to show my student ID which didn&#039;t match... With any amount of quick thinking though the personal info part can be avoided/faked<br /><br />Within a couple minutes of handing the cashier money the confirmation email rolls in.

				Do places like CVS and Wal-Mart charge a fee additional to the fees mentioned on the bitinstant website.&nbsp; The website says &quot;the fee you see includes any charged by payment providers and should be the total amount you can expect to pay.&quot;&nbsp; On the &quot;fees and rates&quot; page I mostly see fees of 1.29% (under $100) and 0.89% ($100 and over).

				My first 5 transactions i used bank deposits through dwolla until they and mt gox wantd photo ID copies, since then i have used nothing but wal-mat and CVS, i prefer walmart as u just fill out a form and hand it in and thats that, with CVS you have to use the red (moneygram) phone and&nbsp; talk to a live person which is something i dont prefer. But with both of those proof of ID is required. The first two or three times i used my own ID as it has an old address on it for me but still not as secure as i would like it. So since then i have used a very close friend of mine to make deposits for me, a friend that cant really be tied back to me. This has worked out so far, going 6 months without a hitch, the way i see it once it hits instawallet a few times then to the road its damn near untraceable, it would cost too much time and money for the LE to investigate on something that is not worth it

				I used the walmart method today, deposited my money cash and provided them with an identity that was filled with errors in address, name etc (Similar to my actual identity, since I was worried that they were going to ask for ID, since I already had shown the clerk that I had identification as I pulled out the cash from my wallet)<br />Should I be worried about that? <br />Im not an experienced user, but aware that buying bitcoins is, as far as I understand, a completely legal process. <br />Anyhow, after the deposit was made, I got the BTC sent to my TORmail and then transfered through Coinapult onto SR.<br />Any inputs here? Should I re-transfer the funds through some sort of tumbler like CoinFog(Or whatever the service is called), or can I consider this to be pretty safe seeing as I used Coinapult -&gt; SR? <br />Sorry if this is something I could figure out from reading stickies or FAQs, but with the good responses in this thread it seemed like the place to ask.<br />Any other tips to improve safety before I venture into the world of vendors would be greatly appreciated! I am, of course, extremely worried about my freedom and staying out of trouble (as much as I can ;)), so I just try to keep it as safe and anonymous as possible. <br /><br />Post #1

				This is the only way I buy my coin and it works fairly well. You don&#039;t even need to have a slip filled out, I just take a pic of it on my phone. <br />However, I have had problems with 7-11 and their machines not taking my bills. It&#039;s kind of annoying so I usually just give up and go to a CVS. The cashier has minimal interaction with you and frankly isn&#039;t paid enough to give a shit about what you are doing. A bank however is designed to fuck people over as much as possible and be as nosey as possible. <br /><br />Plus, depending on where you live, there may be a lot of moneygram locations.

				I used it about a week ago for the first time, and it worked well. Instead of a phone (it was through MoneyGram at a local Wal-Mart) I filled out a money transfer form with the sent, receive and amount total, which is generated by BitInstant. You can print out a .pdf file of it, or use a smartphone with an image on it, either way. Other than the local yokal not quite knowing how to use the computer, it only took about 5 or 6 minutes, and as I recall, was credited quickly, maybe about 10 min. It was quick enough. <br /><br />I have wondered, though, how often before I started getting weird looks or whatever - small town thing as well. But everything certainly went well that first time.

				This was my first time ever trying to purchase bitcoins and of course I was a bit skeptical. However, this method could not have been any easier. At CVS all you have to do is talk on the red MoneyGram phone and give the necessary information. Since they did not ID me, you can use fake info. I of course hesitated a bit when he asked me if I was some random person, but he payed it no mind. The only thing that seemed to go wrong, is when I was checking out the computer didn&#039;t add the ZipZap fee and it would not process the payment. Luckily, the manager knew what he was doing and came over, and got things straightened out pretty quickly. I will definitely will be doing this method again, seeing as how there is a CVS down the street from my house. There is no need to worry, but of course I was super paranoid until I got home and saw the bitcoins already added to my acount.

				I used the Walmart method recently for my first Bitcoin purchase.<br /><br />BitInstant to printout form&gt;Walmart&gt;BitInstant converted $ into BitCoin&gt;SR Wallet<br /><br />Got my address code from SR and entered it into the info for BitInstant-Cash Deposit.&nbsp; Printed my receipt and left to pay cash for my BitCoins.<br /><br />I had tried 7-11 and CVS before going to Walmart, but their machines were down or they no longer had Moneygram; but others here have used them with success, and I have no problem using the Moneygram phone, so I will try again in the future,&nbsp; <br /><br />I went in to the local Walmart and at the customer service desk I asked if they did Moneygram as I did not see the emblem at the storefront window, or anywhere else.&nbsp; The person at the desk said that they do Moneygram and she asked if I was Sending or Receiving?&nbsp; I told her sending and she gave me a red form to complete.&nbsp; I thought it was supposed to be blue, so I checked my receipt from BitInstant and I needed the blue Express/Bill Pay form.&nbsp; I went back to the counter and got that one.&nbsp; Filled it out with fake info: name, address, phone and the real account number and receive code from my BitInstant receipt.<br /><br />Gave it to the lady and had all info memorized in case she asked.&nbsp; She looked over the form and asked where I was sending it, because I had forgot to fill out the company name on the form.&nbsp; I told her ZipZap and she could not find that business listing on her MoneyGram computer, so she pulled out some numbers and said she was going to have to call Moneygram.&nbsp; I Showed her my BitINstant receipt with ZipZap&#039;s name on it, and she said she would try one more thing before calling.&nbsp; She noticed my name was not in the system (MoneyGram system?) and she entered my personal info and then she was able to enter ZipZap and the transaction went through just fine.&nbsp; I paid the money for BitCoin plus $3.95 processing fee.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; The lady never asked for ID, but she did clarify my address by reading only the numbers back to me (i write sloppy sometimes, but tried to have good penmenship to prevent any problems with the form).&nbsp; Then I gave her the cash, and she gave me the customer copy of the blue form and my receipt.&nbsp; While she was ringing me up, she did comment &quot;no fee, cool&quot; and asked &quot;are they like an online business, I haven&#039;t heard of ZipZap before?&quot;&nbsp; I told her &quot;yeah, you can pay bills too.&quot;&nbsp; And that was the extent of our conversation.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they did ask for my ID I would have said,&quot; I have paid bills before and they never asked for ID.&nbsp; It is only when I have received cash that they needed it.&quot;&nbsp; If they pressed the issue, I would say I would have to go get it and come back then.<br /><br />I got home and had an email waiting telling me that the transaction went through.&nbsp; I had to wait about 75 minutes and the BitCoin showed up in my SR account.&nbsp; BitInstant charged about a 4%&nbsp; fee to convert my money into Bitcoin.&nbsp; Next time I will definitely use Coinapult or similar to further anonymize my BitCoin purchase before it is loaded into my SR wallet. <br /><br />Definitely post your experiences here because it helped me Immensely to understand how to complete the transaction and do it safely as I have only sent money one other time a while ago.<br />

				Last night after getting drunk, incredibly stoned, and looking at SR listings, I said fuck it, and decided to try to get some bitcoins for the first time.&nbsp; I chose the 7-11 option via BitInstant.&nbsp; <br /><br />At around 3am, I drove to 7-11, and told the guy that I was trying to send a moneygram.&nbsp; He had no idea what I was talking about, but pointed to the back of the store and said &quot;I think that machine does something like that&quot;.&nbsp; I looked back and there was a big kiosk with a telephone that said &quot;Moneygram&quot; on it.&nbsp; The phone automatically dialed moneygram, and a woman started talking to me.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I couldn&#039;t comprehend what she was telling me, and I think muttered something about &quot;depositing cash&quot;...&nbsp; I just hung up the phone and awkwardly walked out of the store with the 7-11 guy staring at me.<br /><br />Basically, don&#039;t try to buy bitcoins unless you&#039;re sober.&nbsp; At this point I&#039;m just happy I didn&#039;t get a DUI, or hit another car while I was driving..&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely give it another shot tomorrow, probably with Wal-Mart.

				I&#039;ve only done the WalMart option, but I can attest that it is VERY hassle free.&nbsp; My story is similar to everyone else.&nbsp; I went to Bitinstant and entered the amount I wanted.&nbsp; They take something like 4% of your transaction.&nbsp; There will also be a very small fee (a few dollars) taken by Zipzap, which is the company that you are actually sending the moneygram to.&nbsp; Anyway, you enter your bitcoin address found in your account and then a zip code or city so that it can search for stores near you.&nbsp; It will ask for your email, but you truthfully don&#039;t need it.&nbsp; They just send confirmation to an email if it is provided.&nbsp; Once a store is chosen, you have the option to open a pdf file which gives you two numbers you will need when you make the transaction at the store.&nbsp; Either write down these two numbers, or take a printout with you.&nbsp; The people working at Customer Service at my WalMart are super ghetto and can never understand why I come in with this printed form, but fuck em.&nbsp; You then fill out a short Moneygram &quot;send&quot; form with fake address, fake name, fake signature, and those two numbers which you either wrote down or printed out.&nbsp; THEY WILL NOT ASK YOU FOR ID.&nbsp; Then, you pay the total (which is also given on the pdf) and walk out.&nbsp; Usually, the transaction will be updated instantly through zipzap, which is the intermediary from Bitinstant to your wallet.&nbsp; I have had up to an hour delay getting the coins to my wallet, but it never takes too long.&nbsp; Just be patient.&nbsp; Also, keep in mind the current exchange rate of coins so that you don&#039;t over or under purchase your coins.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty much common sense, but never hurts to add that detail.&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp;

The idea behind laundering your coins is obvious: erase the link between the coins and you. So don&#039;t be impatient / lazy. Follow these easy steps to guarantee your anonymity.<br /><br />1) Go to www.instawallet.org and it will give you your own personal secret site with your own unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose this link, you lose anything in it.<br />- Note: Make sure it&#039;s instawallet.ORG, with .org in the end.<br />- instawallet is a temporary piggy bank. each time you refresh the site you receive a unique randomized bitcoin address and a new secret link.<br />- we are using instawallet to move our bitcoins around, obscuring and fogging up the footprints. that is laundering or &quot;washing&quot; bitcoins.<br /><br />2) Now go back to your Blockchain wallet and click on &quot;Send Money&quot;<br />- simply enter your Instawallet bitcoin address and the amount<br />- Send payment<br /><br />Now your bitcoins have been sent from Blockchain to your Instawallet.<br /><br />The next 2 steps are optional and not extremely necessary, and can be skipped. BUT if you&#039;re meticulous and rightfully PARANOID like me, you should continue with the next 2 easy steps. If you don&#039;t give a fuck, go ahead and skip to step 5.<br /><br />3) Now open up a another Instawallet page, which will give you another unique bitcoin address. This is your second Instawallet address. (bookmark also)<br /><br />4) Send your bitcoins from your first Instawallet page to your second Instawallet address.<br /><br />5) now go to SR, and click on Account<br />- there you&#039;ll see your SR bitcoin address<br /><br />6) Go to your Instawallet that has your coins, and simply enter your SR bitcoin address and press send!<br /><br />That&#039;s it, my darling friends!<br />Just be patient and within a few hours or less you&#039;ll see your bitcoins in your SR account READY for your rascally crusades!<br /><br />If you&#039;re truly of the deranged, extremely super paranoid kind you can ALSO use a site called bitcoin fog. It&#039;s a free service that takes your coins and tumbles them to death, completely washing or BLEACHING them for a few hours. once it&#039;s done your coins are IMMACULATELY CLEAN.<br />you can do that instead of the instawallet steps or in addition to them. depends on your level of paranoia.<br /><br />Some alternatives and different options:<br />- Some people skip Instawallet altogether and only use bitcoinfog alone which serves it&#039;s purpose just fine. Bitcoinfog is truly amazing.<br />- You can use TORwallet.net in addition to or instead of Instawallet, which is a cool completely TOR based online wallet, or another acceptable option is Easywallet.org. All basically the same concept, just different services.<br /><br />So to simplify the whole thing, your options are:<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; SR&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; considered safe, fast and secure. appropriate for most of us.<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet&nbsp; &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; good enough for some, not for me. fastest<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; = safer, slightly slower since you need to wait for bitcoinfog to do it&#039;s tumbling.<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; safest, ultra-paranoia stealth ninja mode, requires patience but provides the most peace of mind<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; TORwallet &gt; Instawallet &gt; SR<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; TORwallet &gt; Easywallet &gt; Instawallet &gt; SR<br /><br />As you can see, you have different options depending on your patience and paranoia level.<br /><br />BTW, this guide works exactly the same with CVS or Moneygram. Instead of going to a bank branch, use the same routine, same steps. Only instead of the Trustcash site you&#039;ll be directed to a ZipZap site. You print the paper, go to the CVS / 7/11 / Moneygram closest to you, use the red phone and give them your account and routing information. Then give the cash and the printed paper from ZipZap to the CVS / MoneyGram clerk. <br />Your bitcoins will show up in your blockchain wallet by the time you get home. Also no ID required at all!! though there have been few reports that sometimes they&#039;ll ask for it. refuse or go elsewhere.<br /><br />Bonus useful tips:<br />1) When entering bitcoin addresses ALWAYS COPY PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long ass address. Always triple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination. Imagine sending 100 BTC to a bitcoin address that has 1 wrong digit or letter.. you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example more than 1 week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as TORwallet or Instawallet. These temportary wallets are mostly useful for moving funds around. If you want to store your bitcoins somewhere for a long period of time use your Blockchain.info wallet or just keep all your bitcoins in your SR account. They will not disappear ever from there.<br /><br />3) Instead of saving all your login / password or bitcoin addresses, etc or all other SR related info in some notepad or text document on your harddrive, register for a TORMAIL account and keep all your links, passwords, and sensitive information in your Drafts section there.<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t use empty houses or drop locations to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that the vendors use professionally printed&nbsp; properly aligned labels with your address and name in all CAPS. If you&#039;re ordering small personal use amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much less risky than sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look for with these tricks. You can use your name slightly misspelled or altered. Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that lived / rented your place before.<br /><br />5) PGP is highly important. Always use it when messaging any sensitive information.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />love,<br />mrdobolina<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Some basic information about ESCROW, STATS AND FE:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Another very important topic for noobs to UNDERSTAND: Your buying stats mean so fucking much for your survival in SR. If you&#039;re coming on here to scam vendors for free shit, you&#039;re a piece of shit and your stats will reflect that. Once you become part of SR, and you start purchasing your goodies, as a buyer you need to follow the SIMPLE procedure of SR&#039;s ESCROW system. That way everyone including you can continue to enjoy SR without unnecessary bullshit.<br /><br />The Escrow system is simple and brilliant. SR temporarily holds your money.. which means the vendor you are buying from does not receive your bitcoins UNTIL you receive your order. Once you receive your order you must click FINALIZE, then SR releases your bitcoins to the vendor. The escrow exists so both parties feel relatively safe and comfortable doing business with each other, preventing risk and satisfying both sides. The vendor is putting his profit on hold until you finalize the transaction, so you are responsible to make sure your vendor gets the money he DESERVES.<br />Again, when you place your order the bitcoins LEAVE your account but is not actually released / given to your vendor until you FINALIZE the order (when you receive the item). Obviously this system guarantees the vendor ships your item. So being under the Escrow is the best thing for you.<br /><br />The problem is a bunch of lowlife roaches decide to not finalize their orders, so these vendors are out on product and the coins they deserve. These kind of shitty buyers are causing more and more vendors to require FE (Finalizing Early) before shipping to reduce their risk.<br /><br />You will see the word FE tossed around a lot. FE means Finalize Early. That means your vendor will get your money before shipping your product. The risk is all on your side in that case. That is why we all hate having to FE because of the slight risk to us. Theoretically a shithead vendor can decide NOT to ship your product(s) after you&#039;ve FE&#039;d. Technically he is paid in full and it all comes down to trusting the vendor&#039;s reputation. Vendors require buyers with less than 5-10 successful transactions to FE. Or a vendor could request FE for an international order. All depends on the listing and circumstances. The reason they want FE is because of a few rotten pieces of shits that abuse the noble, consoling Escrow System that really makes SR a satisfying stress-free place to do business.<br /><br /><br />That is precisely why your STATS mean everything on SR. Once your stats show you are a reliable hassle-free buyer you can avoid having to FE. Remember that vendors screen your stats just like you screen their feedback / reviews.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a shitty buyer vendors will simply deny serving you or make you FE. Plus you&#039;re a scumbag.<br />If you&#039;re a good buyer with good stats vendors will allow you to stay within escrow, and if you&#039;re lucky you might even get some special treatment / perks. You are guaranteed to receive top notch service with or without good stats but vendors appreciate good buyer stats, period. So work on being a good buyer if you&#039;re happy with your goods / services received.<br /><br />We have this ridiculously unbelievable LUXURY to buy any drug imaginable with a few clicks, like shopping on amazon. Instead of dealing with shady lowlife street deaers, we get to shop for our goodies in a sophisticated way, knowing precisely what you&#039;re getting, with detailed descriptions about purity, brand names, and all the knowledge we need to make educated, safe purchases. Instead of relying on the word from some moron street dealer that can&#039;t give you any of these luxuries. This is SOMETHING valuable we need to cherish and MAINTAIN. <br />So respect the escrow system, SR&#039;s simple rules, and HONOR THE HARMONY.. so we can keep this thing going forever. So we can have easier honest transactions with vendors.<br /><br />Same principles applies to the vendors. Mostly we have honorable vendors that work hard to get their good feedback and reputation. They provide us with good quality gear and professional customer service. There are also few scumbag vendors selling garbage or selective scamming. The way our stats matter to vendors, their feedback and forum reviews immensely matter to us buywea. We expect remarkable, premium quality product and top notch service. We set our standards high and there are many wonderful vendors that can accommodate our refined cravings and experienced palettes with GOOD SHIT. Those vendors get the well deserved 5/5 feedback and have the forums buzzing like crazy spreading the word.. buzz on the forums is HUGE for vendors. <br /><br />Everyone on the forum is always asking the same question again and again: &quot;who has the best &lt;drug of choice&gt; on SR?&quot; that&#039;s the most asked question here. <br /><br />When you&#039;re looking for a vendor, besides the obvious best selling listings that dominate the first pages, search the forums for more detailed in depth reviews..<br />You can find each drug has it&#039;s &quot;vendor review thread&quot;.&nbsp; Those threads are packed with amazing posts by amazing people. Here in the forun you can find out about new vendors just settng up shop that have OUTSTANDING products. So use these forums to find the hidden gems, new vendors that have FIRE sht, that want your business so their feedback can grow. <br /><br />Lets say your order doesn&#039;t arrive or something went wrong, that is what the RESOLVE button is for. That will prompt a mini chat type interface between you and the vendor allowing some back-n-forth discussion regarding partial or full refunds, reships, or anything else that might remedy the problem. Good vendors truly care about their customers so before starting a thread bashing a vendor, message him/her first or go through the RESOLVE process to hopefully find a suitable solution.<br />Don&#039;t make a habit of asking for refunds unless it us truly genuinely necassary. Because REMEMBER: having too many refunds, or a reoccurring unusual pattern of problems / complaints will negatively affect your stats!<br /><br />SCAMMERS, AND TROUBLEMAKERS:<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />Here on SR we are a unique well-bred, noble breed of sophisticated drug user, defying all logic and stigma that the typical drug user has.. we try our best to maintain the MUTUAL RESPECT and courtesy between vendor and buyer. <br />unfortunately there will always be pieces of shits trying to run cons and scam. whether it&#039;s on SR, or in the streets. in the streets at least we&#039;re able to toss medium sized bricks directly towards their chins or jaw for some sense of relief, but here we have something else.<br /><br />This is very important to UNDERSTAND: scamming and any monkey business doesn&#039;t fly here. If you have any shitty intentions to scam on here I&#039;ll clearly explan why you SHOULND&#039;T EVEN DARE OR ATTEMPT TO SCAM or play fuckery games with vendors:<br /><br />The vendors have their own private forum. In their forum they have a BLACKLIST of BANNED CUSTOMERS that all vendors see and post in regularly. Once you&#039;re in this list you&#039;re fucked.<br />Any buyer on here attempting to scam, not finalize their orders, score free drugs, or ANY other types of remotely shady / scummy bullshit acts, will simply be ADDED and permanently LOGGED in this infamous BLACKLIST DATABASE of customers NEVER to deal with. But wait, not only your username will be posted but your FULL NAME AND ADDRESS too!<br />even if you constantly reregister new SR accounts your address / name will still be on this list. This is to truly keep these shameless, thieving scoundrels / rodents away from our loving community.<br /><br /><br /><br />MISC. USEFUL TIPS:<br />_________<br /><br />1) When you&#039;re required to FE, you&#039;re forced to leave feedback before receiving your product. Most people just write: &quot;FE, will update when arrives&quot; but they never actually update that feedback. Please take the time to update your feedback once you receive your items so others can read and learn from your experience. We hate seeing a vendor with all 5/5 feedback saying &quot;FE, will update later&quot; and no REVIEWS about the actual product.<br />To update your feedback, go to &#039;Account&#039; on SR and you&#039;ll see &#039;View Feedback&#039;. There you can modify / edit your feedback. Always think about the community and how to better serve us all.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There you have it!<br />Eat your vegetables and stay hydrated.<br /><br /><br /><br />PS: @Admins please sticky this shit if you see fit. I needed this info when I first joined and I needed it displayed in this simple step by step format. I saw many threads asking the same questions over and over, with some great replies but one has to skim and dig through different threads to find the answers.. so I think this could help other noobs hungry and eager for this information.<br /><br />love,<br />mrdobolina

				I had this issue a couple of times, both on the weekend btw, don&#039;t know if that&#039;s relevant, but then read somewhere on here to generate a new SR wallet (it&#039;s right there next to your wallet id) each time you&#039;re going to load it.&nbsp; Ever since I started doing that the transfer has happened in btwn 30 mins and an hour,&nbsp; and with btwn 5 and 10 confirmations on the blockchain info site.&nbsp; Hope that helps, good luck!<br />

				ya $500 is the limit for moneygrams at CVS etc. If you do a bank deposit the limit is $1000 i believe. I just did a deposit at Wells Fargo, a lot easier then CVS.

				I&#039;ll second Wells Fargo as a decent avenue for this. I actually just made a Bitinstant deposit through them today too, and here&#039;s what happened. The teller suspected I was getting scammed right away so she explained the situation to the banker, and the banker began researching Bitinstant to see if it was legit. She asked me a few questions about it and I explained the concept to her, but you could tell she was completely unfamiliar with this kind of thing. She thought at first that I was buying physical coins. ::)<br /><br />But after finding nothing suspicious she advised me of the risks and said I could make the deposit if I so wished. And everything went smoothly. I figure if I keep going there to make my deposits, they&#039;ll probably just remember me as &quot;that guy with the coins.&quot;

				This was the method I used for my first foray into purchasing BTCs earlier this week. That instructional video bitinstant has up on their website was a huge help in taking care of any potential jitters I might have had. Coins showed up in my SR account by the time I&#039;d got back home.

				I agree that bank deposit is the easiest. They don&#039;t typically even ask you any questions - you just write the account number on a deposit slip, hand them the money, and they do the rest. Also, I know some people are worried about cameras and stuff... but you have to remember that buying bitcoins is 100% legal. If you are patient and &#039;wash&#039; them as described a few posts up, there is no way to really trace it back anyway. It&#039;s worth noting that when you send your bitcoins to SR they are kind of washed as well... they are no longer in your control. The bitcoins in your account are simply an entry in a database. <br />.Hades.

				Ok guys i use bitinstant and its no issue, There is a local cash express or cash advance somehing like that near me where bitinstant told me i could go, i walk in wig my receipt i print i hand it to her,same women everytime, she doesnt have a clue what it even is, she said iv never delt with this before i said well is there a issue? she said no not at all just give me a sec, she added my money asked for my name NOT A ID Because bitcoins are legal to buy you dont need to lie about your name but you can for safty b ut if you do and then they were to ask for a id it brings attention...So i just used my reAL name and on the print up receipt i used a mailinator email address...NO ISSUE AT ALL... I&nbsp; told her i was paying a business, which its really non of anyones business who you are paying but if asked just like the tutorial vid says, just so your sending money to a business it is a legal transaction, BITCOINS R LEGAL SR MEMBERS...I even send my coin right to my SR acct #....Then soon as i got home i called zipzap they said yep we got your money 10minets ago...Here&#039;s a tip guys you can use your SR account to deposite the money u dont have to send it through other accounts first, SR has a tumbler already in place. Also when choosing to send straight to SR you can go to blockchain and at the home page at the bottom paste your sr # into it and hit search, it will show when your transaction starts and how many confirmations it takes before its done, you dont need a blockchain wallet to do this..I didnt know this til i got online help at bitinstant, at first they checked my account cause after 45 min on block chain it did not even show a transaction so i live chatted again with bitinstant, they took my account # looked into it and said yep there was a little delay and she was contacting teq support to fix that moment, well within 5 min i check back on blockchain and sure enuff it was fixed show how much money i added and how many previous transaction, now it took3 hours to get to SR and at the bottom where it says how many i forget the exact word transaction or something at the bottom right in a blue box, it will have a # starts at 1 it took mine 10 then it showed up on SR 12 all together and it was done.. I have a blockchain wallet also just in case for another reason though but for those of you who did not know Blockchain has every bitcoin wallet everymade on it, thats how your able to put your sr account # in at the bottom and it will pull up and u can make sure everything is going smooth. At first i was gonna do CVS also but then i found out i have a place 5 min from me i went with that, again the lady did not give a damn, and also again its non of their business what your paying pr doing, watch the ladybytes video how to tutorial on biitinstant, she sends her money to block chain though, its easy and faster to just send right to the road and as i said SR already has a timbler in place so by the time your coins hit silk road it doesnt matter..Btw the place i used it was with money gram, but as it states every where is difrent . But i didnt have to fill out anypaper work or nothing. Hell if they ask like i said your paying s company money or your investing but really its non of their business.. I thought aboutt htr bank but said to myself fuck that.. But again No need to hide yourself or idenity you are buying bitcoins and half the places dont know what a bitcoin is or what zipzap is so its cool..But there is a 3.99 commission plus 1dollar then 3.95 to pay to zipzap, last time i put 70bucks down i paid 73.95 i ended up with 66. something i cant remember the rest..But i did it the coins went up to 12.45 a coin days befor they were 12.11 i have a sweet coin conver site if anyones needs it PM me or any question PM me, your safe though//Happy buying and happying riding down silkroad, i love it, iv gotton 3bags of BTH 1 opana 10mg iv able and 1 gram of sippose opium with 90bucks...I love this place, and now that i have this connect i linked up with a dude on FB that has the regular pink 10mg opana ir the ones they stoped making he has access to his and about 200 more and only wants 1 dollar each, he is in my same state,good thing is no sending the money and waiting on the drugs, i msg him, he has a dilivery service come to me about 4 to5 hours later, the service doesnt know he just puts whatever is a coffe bag vacum seals the pills and u payb 5bucks for the delivery and then however mny pills u bought, i couldnt believe it!!!! dude has shrooms weed other pills etc....and like i said whats great pay on delivery same day service cause were in same state....BUT GUYS 1 DOLLAR FOR A 50 TO 60 DOLLAR OPANA??? it doesnt get any better, and he sent me pics first, then me and my boy made a test order 20 bucks each ot 40 opana pills and he thre in 5 xanax bars for free...Thats top notch and just as good as SR

The idea behind laundering your coins is obvious: erase the link between the coins and you. So don&#039;t be impatient / lazy. Follow these easy steps to guarantee your anonymity.<br /><br />1) Go to www.instawallet.org and it will give you your own personal secret site with your own unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose this link, you lose anything in it.<br />- Note: Make sure it&#039;s instawallet.ORG, with .org in the end.<br />- instawallet is a temporary piggy bank. each time you refresh the site you receive a unique randomized bitcoin address and a new secret link.<br />- we are using instawallet to move our bitcoins around, obscuring and fogging up the footprints. that is laundering or &quot;washing&quot; bitcoins.<br /><br />2) Now go back to your Blockchain wallet and click on &quot;Send Money&quot;<br />- simply enter your Instawallet bitcoin address and the amount<br />- Send payment<br /><br />Now your bitcoins have been sent from Blockchain to your Instawallet.<br /><br />The next 2 steps are optional and not extremely necessary, and can be skipped. BUT if you&#039;re meticulous and rightfully PARANOID like me, you should continue with the next 2 easy steps. If you don&#039;t give a fuck, go ahead and skip to step 5.<br /><br />3) Now open up a another Instawallet page, which will give you another unique bitcoin address. This is your second Instawallet address. (bookmark also)<br /><br />4) Send your bitcoins from your first Instawallet page to your second Instawallet address.<br /><br />5) now go to SR, and click on Account<br />- there you&#039;ll see your SR bitcoin address<br /><br />6) Go to your Instawallet that has your coins, and simply enter your SR bitcoin address and press send!<br /><br />That&#039;s it, my darling friends!<br />Just be patient and within a few hours or less you&#039;ll see your bitcoins in your SR account READY for your rascally crusades!<br /><br />If you&#039;re truly of the deranged, extremely super paranoid kind you can ALSO use a site called bitcoin fog. It&#039;s a free service that takes your coins and tumbles them to death, completely washing or BLEACHING them for a few hours. once it&#039;s done your coins are IMMACULATELY CLEAN.<br />you can do that instead of the instawallet steps or in addition to them. depends on your level of paranoia.<br /><br />Some alternatives and different options:<br />- Some people skip Instawallet altogether and only use bitcoinfog alone which serves it&#039;s purpose just fine. Bitcoinfog is truly amazing.<br />- You can use TORwallet.net in addition to or instead of Instawallet, which is a cool completely TOR based online wallet, or another acceptable option is Easywallet.org. All basically the same concept, just different services.<br /><br />So to simplify the whole thing, your options are:<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; SR&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; considered safe, fast and secure. appropriate for most of us.<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet&nbsp; &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; good enough for some, not for me. fastest<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; = safer, slightly slower since you need to wait for bitcoinfog to do it&#039;s tumbling.<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; safest, ultra-paranoia stealth ninja mode, requires patience but provides the most peace of mind<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; TORwallet &gt; Instawallet &gt; SR<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; TORwallet &gt; Easywallet &gt; Instawallet &gt; SR<br /><br />As you can see, you have different options depending on your patience and paranoia level.<br /><br />BTW, this guide works exactly the same with CVS or Moneygram. Instead of going to a bank branch, use the same routine, same steps. Only instead of the Trustcash site you&#039;ll be directed to a ZipZap site. You print the paper, go to the CVS / 7/11 / Moneygram closest to you, use the red phone and give them your account and routing information. Then give the cash and the printed paper from ZipZap to the CVS / MoneyGram clerk. <br />Your bitcoins will show up in your blockchain wallet by the time you get home. Also no ID required at all!! though there have been few reports that sometimes they&#039;ll ask for it. refuse or go elsewhere.<br /><br />Bonus useful tips:<br />1) When entering bitcoin addresses ALWAYS COPY PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long ass address. Always triple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination. Imagine sending 100 BTC to a bitcoin address that has 1 wrong digit or letter.. you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example more than 1 week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as TORwallet or Instawallet. These temportary wallets are mostly useful for moving funds around. If you want to store your bitcoins somewhere for a long period of time use your Blockchain.info wallet or just keep all your bitcoins in your SR account. They will not disappear ever from there.<br /><br />3) Instead of saving all your login / password or bitcoin addresses, etc or all other SR related info in some notepad or text document on your harddrive, register for a TORMAIL account and keep all your links, passwords, and sensitive information in your Drafts section there.<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t use empty houses or drop locations to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that the vendors use professionally printed&nbsp; properly aligned labels with your address and name in all CAPS. If you&#039;re ordering small personal use amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much less risky than sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look for with these tricks. You can use your name slightly misspelled or altered. Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that lived / rented your place before.<br /><br />5) PGP is highly important. Always use it when messaging any sensitive information.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />love,<br />mrdobolina<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Some basic information about ESCROW, STATS AND FE:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Another very important topic for noobs to UNDERSTAND: Your buying stats mean so fucking much for your survival in SR. If you&#039;re coming on here to scam vendors for free shit, you&#039;re a piece of shit and your stats will reflect that. Once you become part of SR, and you start purchasing your goodies, as a buyer you need to follow the SIMPLE procedure of SR&#039;s ESCROW system. That way everyone including you can continue to enjoy SR without unnecessary bullshit.<br /><br />The Escrow system is simple and brilliant. SR temporarily holds your money.. which means the vendor you are buying from does not receive your bitcoins UNTIL you receive your order. Once you receive your order you must click FINALIZE, then SR releases your bitcoins to the vendor. The escrow exists so both parties feel relatively safe and comfortable doing business with each other, preventing risk and satisfying both sides. The vendor is putting his profit on hold until you finalize the transaction, so you are responsible to make sure your vendor gets the money he DESERVES.<br />Again, when you place your order the bitcoins LEAVE your account but is not actually released / given to your vendor until you FINALIZE the order (when you receive the item). Obviously this system guarantees the vendor ships your item. So being under the Escrow is the best thing for you.<br /><br />The problem is a bunch of lowlife roaches decide to not finalize their orders, so these vendors are out on product and the coins they deserve. These kind of shitty buyers are causing more and more vendors to require FE (Finalizing Early) before shipping to reduce their risk.<br /><br />You will see the word FE tossed around a lot. FE means Finalize Early. That means your vendor will get your money before shipping your product. The risk is all on your side in that case. That is why we all hate having to FE because of the slight risk to us. Theoretically a shithead vendor can decide NOT to ship your product(s) after you&#039;ve FE&#039;d. Technically he is paid in full and it all comes down to trusting the vendor&#039;s reputation. Vendors require buyers with less than 5-10 successful transactions to FE. Or a vendor could request FE for an international order. All depends on the listing and circumstances. The reason they want FE is because of a few rotten pieces of shits that abuse the noble, consoling Escrow System that really makes SR a satisfying stress-free place to do business.<br /><br /><br />That is precisely why your STATS mean everything on SR. Once your stats show you are a reliable hassle-free buyer you can avoid having to FE. Remember that vendors screen your stats just like you screen their feedback / reviews.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a shitty buyer vendors will simply deny serving you or make you FE. Plus you&#039;re a scumbag.<br />If you&#039;re a good buyer with good stats vendors will allow you to stay within escrow, and if you&#039;re lucky you might even get some special treatment / perks. You are guaranteed to receive top notch service with or without good stats but vendors appreciate good buyer stats, period. So work on being a good buyer if you&#039;re happy with your goods / services received.<br /><br />We have this ridiculously unbelievable LUXURY to buy any drug imaginable with a few clicks, like shopping on amazon. Instead of dealing with shady lowlife street deaers, we get to shop for our goodies in a sophisticated way, knowing precisely what you&#039;re getting, with detailed descriptions about purity, brand names, and all the knowledge we need to make educated, safe purchases. Instead of relying on the word from some moron street dealer that can&#039;t give you any of these luxuries. This is SOMETHING valuable we need to cherish and MAINTAIN. <br />So respect the escrow system, SR&#039;s simple rules, and HONOR THE HARMONY.. so we can keep this thing going forever. So we can have easier honest transactions with vendors.<br /><br />Same principles applies to the vendors. Mostly we have honorable vendors that work hard to get their good feedback and reputation. They provide us with good quality gear and professional customer service. There are also few scumbag vendors selling garbage or selective scamming. The way our stats matter to vendors, their feedback and forum reviews immensely matter to us buywea. We expect remarkable, premium quality product and top notch service. We set our standards high and there are many wonderful vendors that can accommodate our refined cravings and experienced palettes with GOOD SHIT. Those vendors get the well deserved 5/5 feedback and have the forums buzzing like crazy spreading the word.. buzz on the forums is HUGE for vendors. <br /><br />Everyone on the forum is always asking the same question again and again: &quot;who has the best &lt;drug of choice&gt; on SR?&quot; that&#039;s the most asked question here. <br /><br />When you&#039;re looking for a vendor, besides the obvious best selling listings that dominate the first pages, search the forums for more detailed in depth reviews..<br />You can find each drug has it&#039;s &quot;vendor review thread&quot;.&nbsp; Those threads are packed with amazing posts by amazing people. Here in the forun you can find out about new vendors just settng up shop that have OUTSTANDING products. So use these forums to find the hidden gems, new vendors that have FIRE sht, that want your business so their feedback can grow. <br /><br />Lets say your order doesn&#039;t arrive or something went wrong, that is what the RESOLVE button is for. That will prompt a mini chat type interface between you and the vendor allowing some back-n-forth discussion regarding partial or full refunds, reships, or anything else that might remedy the problem. Good vendors truly care about their customers so before starting a thread bashing a vendor, message him/her first or go through the RESOLVE process to hopefully find a suitable solution.<br />Don&#039;t make a habit of asking for refunds unless it us truly genuinely necassary. Because REMEMBER: having too many refunds, or a reoccurring unusual pattern of problems / complaints will negatively affect your stats!<br /><br />SCAMMERS, AND TROUBLEMAKERS:<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />Here on SR we are a unique well-bred, noble breed of sophisticated drug user, defying all logic and stigma that the typical drug user has.. we try our best to maintain the MUTUAL RESPECT and courtesy between vendor and buyer. <br />unfortunately there will always be pieces of shits trying to run cons and scam. whether it&#039;s on SR, or in the streets. in the streets at least we&#039;re able to toss medium sized bricks directly towards their chins or jaw for some sense of relief, but here we have something else.<br /><br />This is very important to UNDERSTAND: scamming and any monkey business doesn&#039;t fly here. If you have any shitty intentions to scam on here I&#039;ll clearly explan why you SHOULND&#039;T EVEN DARE OR ATTEMPT TO SCAM or play fuckery games with vendors:<br /><br />The vendors have their own private forum. In their forum they have a BLACKLIST of BANNED CUSTOMERS that all vendors see and post in regularly. Once you&#039;re in this list you&#039;re fucked.<br />Any buyer on here attempting to scam, not finalize their orders, score free drugs, or ANY other types of remotely shady / scummy bullshit acts, will simply be ADDED and permanently LOGGED in this infamous BLACKLIST DATABASE of customers NEVER to deal with. But wait, not only your username will be posted but your FULL NAME AND ADDRESS too!<br />even if you constantly reregister new SR accounts your address / name will still be on this list. This is to truly keep these shameless, thieving scoundrels / rodents away from our loving community.<br /><br /><br /><br />MISC. USEFUL TIPS:<br />_________<br /><br />1) When you&#039;re required to FE, you&#039;re forced to leave feedback before receiving your product.

				ok, so I went to CVS and had no trouble.&nbsp; I doubted the whole having your coins by the time you get home, but sure enough.&nbsp; Very convenient.&nbsp; I was not asked for ID which was nice.&nbsp; I might suggest for those worried about being asked for ID.&nbsp; Give the money gram person your real name, but just make everything else up.&nbsp; If you are IDed you can say you just moved or whatever, but your name will match up.&nbsp; If they still give you shit I&#039;d suggest just trying another CVS.&nbsp; It may just be at the managers discretion.&nbsp; The guys said they have a good amount of traffic each day using the red phone and if he didn&#039;t ask me for ID then they obviously don&#039;t check ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s worth noting that setting up a Bank Deposit is 10x less work than messing around with the red phone. You walk into the bank, grab a deposit slip, put the account number and amount to deposit onto the slip (you don&#039;t need a name or anything) and hand it to the teller with some cash. They&#039;ll never ask for ID or ask for any information from you the way MoneyGram does... even if you make the stuff up... it&#039;s annoying.<br /><br />Sure banks aren&#039;t open 24/7.. but with the choice of BoA, CITI, or Wells Fargo, it&#039;s likely there is one pretty close to you.<br />.Hades.

				I&#039;ve now successfully used bitinstant twice, with two different deposit methods.&nbsp; The first was Wal-Mart.&nbsp; I accessed bitinstant with tor, and chose the cash deposit into bitcoin address.&nbsp; I used an Instawallet address, fake name, fake address and fake number.&nbsp; Once I was done, my payment slip was processed, and I took a picture of it with my phone.&nbsp; At Wal-Mart I filled out the blue express moneygram using the numbers from the payment slip, and handed it to the teller.&nbsp; She knew what was up with moneygram and just started typing the numbers in.&nbsp; She asked for the exact amount of cash, I paid, and it was in my Instawallet within 20 minutes.<br /><br />The other place I used was for check cashing, western union, etc.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a local chain, not sure.&nbsp; It was the same process except the lady asked me what ZipZap (the company that buys your coins) was.&nbsp; I just told her it was for online bill paying.<br /><br />Either way, this is an incredibly quick and easy option for bitcoins.

				Hey Everyone,<br /><br />For some reason, every time I have used CVS/Money-gram the cashiers have had the hardest time trying to figure out how to preform their role in the process.&nbsp; One instance was so bad that I had to call back the Money Gram agent and actually put him on with the cashier.&nbsp; Nightmare scenario!&nbsp; Especially considering I wanted to get in, be inconspicuous, do what I came to do and then vamoose my way the hell out of there as fast as I could.<br /><br />I have a feeling that it may have to do with the fact that the communities these CVS locations have been in were wealthy ones.&nbsp; I think they mostly cater to people who may rarely, if ever, use a service like this because they don&#039;t find they need it (this is me trying desperately to use words that nobody across the socioeconomic gamut will be offended by and avoid making tasteless generalizations and/or stereotypes as best I can).&nbsp; I myself have never been a person of means - throughout my entire life but what I do have is enough lived experience to be able to pick up on things like this.&nbsp; The other indication that tells me this theory holds some water is that we have a Walmart in a nearby town that is home to a lot more blue collar and/or working class folks (like my parents) and those Walmart employees always know what they are doing because they have more customers who make use of the Money-Gram service, therefore providing with what we all need to become good at things - experience and lots of it.<br /><br />I use the bank method mostly and fortunately B of A has a lot of branches in my area, so I rotate.&nbsp; They even have one at our obnoxiously over sized and even more hysterically overpriced mall that is open until 9PM.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had a teller recently ask me what this Trust Cash thing was because she had been doing a lot of transactions just like mine.&nbsp; The best and shortest explanation I could come up with on the spot was that it was a newer and far more secure way of purchasing items online than via methods like PayPal because people who are after the $$ in your PayPal account are ceaselessly developing ways to circumvent their security, no matter how PayPal attempts to make it impenetrable.&nbsp; She was satisfied with that and asked no more questions.<br /><br />And the folks who pointed out that purchasing bitcoins IS NOT ILLEGAL are spot on.&nbsp; I have to remind myself of this constantly so that I maintain a calm, nonchalant and positive persona each time I enter a bank.<br /><br />I guess what I felt most compelled to share was that it&#039;s important to use businesses that employ people who know how to perform the transaction you need so you aren&#039;t spending an eternity there and making yourself impossible to forget.&nbsp; I know I don&#039;t want to be remembered by anyone if, heaven forbid, the shit should someday hit the fan.<br />&nbsp; <br />Sorry this post was so long and if I contradicted myself somewhat.&nbsp; And most importantly if my theory about why some employees are better (more experienced) at performing these transactions than others struck anyone as something other than what I intended - I apologize as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best of Luck,<br />Cass

				That has happened to me several times actually. Try reloading the page(you will have to enter your password again) and send again. If that does not work it is because you are trying to send the exact amount in your wallet. It will not let you do that because of a &quot;miners fee&quot; which is something like .0005 bitcoin. So just leave a very small amount in your blockchain wallet and it should work.

				I decided to go with Wells Fargo for my first Bitcoin purchase after reading this thread. I chose a bank over Walmart/CVS not only because it&#039;s reportedly less hassle, but because I don&#039;t like the idea of having to lie about my identity on a written document in order to stay more-or-less anonymous, even if the chances are slim to none that a fake name on a Walmart form would ever come back to haunt me.<br /><br />I walked into a downtown Wells Fargo looking put together but not completely out of place, picked up a deposit slip like the ones they have at my personal bank (I couldn&#039;t find an &quot;invoice&quot; slip, if that&#039;s something different) and wrote down 1) the Trustcash account number and 2) the exact amount to be deposited. The teller, who was very nice, asked if I had an address for Trustcash and I said I didn&#039;t- the printout didn&#039;t list one- but she was able to find everything she needed in the computer. As others in the thread have already pointed out, you don&#039;t need to provide a routing number, at least in the US. I gave her my money (she didn&#039;t ask for the several cents on top of the whole dollar amount, but I gave it to her anyway), got my receipt, and walked out. It took maybe three minutes. There were no questions about what the deposit was for, though I was prepared to use CassiGoli&#039;s line about Trustcash being like PayPal but not.<br /><br />I came home, ran my torified Bitcoin client and watched as the Bitcoins arrived in my wallet several minutes later. According to the timestamp, the transaction was recorded less than 30 minutes after my receipt was printed.<br /><br />So everything went as smoothly as I possibly could have hoped. Even if things don&#039;t go so smoothly next time for whatever reason, I can truthfully say &quot;I did it before and had no problem.&quot; Thanks to everyone in this thread for helping me get over the final hurdle of semi-anonymously acquiring BTC. Now to the Market!

				Congrats! I&#039;ve been touting the bank deposit method for a while - it&#039;s SOO easy! Apparently there has been hitches where people simple hand the teller the invoice... but as you did (and as I&#039;ve posted before), just get the deposit slip, put the account number and dollar amount.. and you&#039;re good to go!<br />.Hades.

				Yea, they asked for my ID at CVS as well and that it is a new policy. Really I suggest using the bank method now, I think it might be a tad(a couple of bucks) more expensive and not quite as convenient but they have no reason at all to ask for ID as there is no personal information exchanged at all. Simply account numbers and dollar figures are spoke about. Though I did have the lady ask me if trustcash &quot;provides a service for me&quot; and I said no it&#039;s for online shopping. But I really think she was just trying to make small talk, not investigate or ask these questions because she is supposed to.

				I frequently use the walmart route. Just put bogus info on the send money form and off you go. Seems to work quite well. I live just down the street 10 blocks from my closest walmart. At it&#039;s fastest the coins were in my SR account before I made it back home. The slowest was on one occasion my coins seemed to be stuck in some limbo for 10 hours.

				If there is a Wells Fargo branch in my town that&#039;s not listed on the TrustCash site, can I get a deposit invoice for a different branch and just write the Trustcash Holdings, Inc. account number on the deposit slip and go through the process at the branch here in town? Also, is it possible to do the bank deposit method at any bank, or just the ones listed on TrustCash (Wells Fargo, BOA, Citi, etc.)?

				Bitinstant is the only way I&#039;ve gotten my coin.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone to CVS and Walmart; you do have to give your name and shit(I always use cash) but you&#039;re only putting money on Mt.Gox and bitcoins are used for other things right?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a printer so I just write down the account number, the amount, the company name, the company&#039;s city and state, and the recive code.&nbsp; I&#039;ve thought about it being unsafe, but the money goes to Mt.Gox, from there to my bitcoin wallet and then onto SR so it seems indirect enough to be safe.&nbsp; If I&#039;m wrong someone please tell me, but I&#039;ve gone to Walmart once and CVS three or four times with no trouble.

				well bitinstant main office is downtown NYC so i figure they are fucked as well. Until they are fully up and running i think they stopped the option to send BTCs...i guess they have no way to trade and sell.&nbsp; So maybe this is not permanent. :-\

				I usually use one of the the cash drop options and it always works great for me... Walmart does ask for this information(name, email, address, phone number) but as long as your purchase is less than 1000USD they don&#039;t ask for an I.D so it is your choice to put what you want... personally it does not bother me to put actual information... Nothing wrong with buying BTC... And getting caught using fake info could defiantly draw attention... I have had my grand parents go do it for me when i have been busy telling them i was paying a bill... not a big deal&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;ve used the MoneyGram red Phone at CVS and its fast and easy. You basically enter the information numerically into the phone and then a recording will tell you to report the the register and tell the cashier that you are completing a bill payment and then you pay them the amount and they give you a reciept I&#039;ve only ever gotten ID&#039;ed once and I think it was a fluke.

				I succeeded at CVS this time, but I had to give a name and address to the Moneygram operator over the phone and, after giving a fake name, the CVS cashiers asked for my ID and refused to process the transaction because it obviously did not match the name I gave the Moneygram people.&nbsp; I had to set the transfer up again on the red phone and give them the real info the second time.&nbsp; Everything went through very quickly after that and my Mt. Gox account was funded by Bitinstant within an hour of the transaction, but I left feeling pretty bad about the whole thing.<br /><br />I know I have nothing to hide because buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, but I still don&#039;t like jumping through all of those hoops.&nbsp; I never had to do that at a bank.

				For what it&#039;s worth, every time I use MoneyGram (at CVS, Walmart, etc.), I always end up having to give some kind of info or being asked for ID. Every time I use IPP/Softgate (on BitInstant, it&#039;s the green one - I only know of one place around here that uses it :/ ), I just walk in, give them a fake name, and it goes through without a problem to ZipZap. I usually get the coins sent to email, but I&#039;ve also used MtGox. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t bother to read through 19 pages on this, so sorry if somebody already posted about this

				I tried this at CVS today and I unfortunately had to give all of my personal info, but I feel confident in Tor and instawallet that there shouldn&#039;t really be any way to trace it back to the person who bought the BTC.<br />It was kind of a pain in the ass. The woman on the red phone spoke bad english and had a hard time understanding me.<br />Then the lady at the counter was confused by the print out, but I shouldn&#039;t have even given it to her now that I know how it works.<br /><br />You just walk in, pick up the phone and dial in all the appropriate info. I bet I wouldn&#039;t have had to talk to an operator if I had read the sheet more carefully. Anyhow I talked to a woman who took my info, I told her how much I wanted to pay and she told me to go to the counter and pay.<br /><br />I was not asked for an ID. *shrug* Just had to say &quot;I want to pay a bill&quot; and give the name that I gave to the red phone people and the amount I wanted to pay.<br /><br />I still can&#039;t wait till the bank deposit comes back, that was easy as shit, though I can see using this when the banks are closed and you want to capitalize on cheap BTC or you just HAVE to have some coins after business hours.

				No need to bother with using fake info for consumer level stuff. <br /><br />One can use bitcoins to buy TF2 (Team Fortress 2- free to play game with rare decorative items that can sell for hundreds of dollars each) items on tf2wh.com / th2whx.com . <br /><br />It&#039;s a viable way to earn money (buying items from the exchange then trading items / selling them via paypal), so several hundred dollars a week it BTC purchases can be easily explained (if need be).

				I have been using Bitinstant &gt; Major Bank Branch &gt; MtGox since joining Silk Road.<br /><br />Since the Major bank branch option was not available, I decided to use the CVS option.<br />I printed out my ZipZap confirmation sheet from Bitinstant and went to my local CVS. I used the red phone to put in my info and then spoke with a service rep on the phone. I gave my real name and address since it&#039;s going to MtGox.<br /><br />After finishing on the phone, I went to the cashier to process the payment.<br />For those of you worried about anonymity, I WAS asked for I.D. - After showing my I.D. that matched the info given, everything went smoothly and the funds were deposited into MtGox in less that 30 minutes.<br /><br />I hope this info helps,<br /><br />Rez

I went there and thought it was going to be a red-phone. They had paper to fill out so I picked it up, got impatient and left. I found a close by CVS and went in there. <br /><br />I went to one CVS a few times and always used a fake name, the people there did not know how to enter the amounts and go through the process correctly and would ask why my name doesn&#039;t match the computer. This always took awhile here and it made me feel weird. <br /><br />After trying Wal-Mart I went to another CVS and used my real info. This worked well because the cashier asked for ID and said the transaction would not be completed if that and the computer did not match. I think I will go to Wal-Mart and just fill out the paper next time. CVS is fast but I would prefer to stay anon.

				Tried Bitinstant yesterday for the first time. First off the amount was small, $150. It was fast and painless. Unless your playing with big bucks, the fees were small and the amount of info you need to give is inobtrusive with coin tumbling. I can&#039;t see the DEA spending time and money to backhack for a small weed purchase.&nbsp; I&#039;m not worried at all about doing the transaction at the local CVS (the same one my daughter works at) even in a small town as it&#039;s a completely legal transaction. Bitinstant will work for me in the future for my needs on the Road in the future.

				i used bitinstant today, worked like a charm, as it always does for me. No ID, no issues. I was sending it to my SR account directly. but since they changed the way the did it. I just send my stuff to MtGox, in a way, i like this better. i can buy BTC at the current price. then transfer to my SR account. so i don&#039;t worry about BTC fluctuations and buy BTCs when i need them. The transfer to my SR account has been pretty fast as well. so far no complaints ...i hope it stays that way ::)

It was much easier than CVS! She didn&#039;t have to try more than once, didn&#039;t ask any information of me, and it was just so fast and hardly had to do any speaking or touch a grimy phone. <br />At CVS you have to type in things and wait for the recorded voice to finish what she&#039;s saying, which is annoying and time consuming. Then you go to the counter, if you&#039;re not redirected to an operator and the voice says it&#039;s okay, where it always has taken so long. I have anxiety so will definitely be using Walmart&#039;s MoneyGram from now on, plus people don&#039;t ask what you need to do when you are going to Walmart they always ask me what I need at CVS (probably because it&#039;s so expensive). The location was never an issue for me - my CVS and Walmart are literally a 1-2 minute drive from each other. 5 minute walk or so, less maybe.<br />Incase anyone searches this question&nbsp; early earliest earlier ...... East<br /><br />I am not sure if the information you give moneygram has to match what you enter at BitInstant? <br /><br />But anyway, Walmart all the way.

				Thats what all this is =] Id suggest using Bitme.com or BlueSky Traders if you have a bank of America by you. CVS is fine to depending on the amount you need to transfer.

				&nbsp; ;) shit guys if your scured do what im doing:<br />im plannin on tryin this as im verified on mtgox. just go online to white pages aand search someone in your area if u want to play it safe. and you left your ID at home (darn it!) that way if they even felt suspicious n looked up the ID they wud find verification, just not YOUR verification or any of it linkin to you. but as long as they dont kno ur real name they wudnt know the difference. which reminds me, i better go to a different cvs cus im known there lol

				When using cash deposit through bitinstant I had no luck after trying 4 or 5 locations including the suggested places. My buddy went with money gram at CVS from bitinstant and had no problems. My advice don&#039;t use their normal 711 cash deposit thing. it wont work and everybody will look at you like you have three heads cuz they don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about. also, poor customer service. check out bitcopia though. seems great. good customer service but haven&#039;t actually tried it. i will next time i need btc and will hopefully remember to report back.<br /><br />UPDATE: fuck yeah, bitcopia. I&#039;m now a loyal user (of bitcopia...not drugs. ok drugs too.)

				I used the VCOM terminal machines at a couple of 7-11 stores. I didn&#039;t like that I had to talk on the phone with a MoneyGram agent, and at one 7-11 the VCOM terminal&#039;s phone didn&#039;t work well and the agent couldn&#039;t hear what I was saying. After this I decided that I would go use a local check-cashing/payday loan/car title loan location to send my MoneyGram payment instead.<br /><br />At the check-cashing/payday loan/car title loan location, I waited in long lines a few times only to discover once I got to the front of the line that their MoneyGram service was down. On the one occasion when I tried and the MoneyGram was actually up, they made me fill out a registration form with a [fake] name, address, and phone number. This is their in-house procedure and it&#039;s used to help me so that I can send MoneyGram payments quicker on future visits, but I don&#039;t want to return there to use an account which I registered in person using false information. I sent the payment on that one day, but I decided that I liked the 7-11 method better since I wasn&#039;t having to wait in a line or deal with a person face-to-face.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I later returned to 7-11, I found that the VCOM terminals had been replaced by CITI terminals that had no phones attached and now if you want to send MoneyGram there, you need to use a cellphone for calling the MoneyGram operator and giving them the payment details. I don&#039;t want to use my cellphone for this purpose so I looked for a new sending location.<br /><br />I next found a nearby supermarket that accepts MoneyGram payments. After setting up the ZipZap transaction at BitInstant, I went to the supermarket and used their MoneyGram kiosk&#039;s phone to give the details to the MoneyGram operator, and then paid my cash to the person at the supermarket&#039;s service counter. It worked just fine. I figured I would use this method in the future.<br /><br />After all of this, BitInstant has changed and now it wants a name and birthdate for sending MoneyGram to a bitcoin address or account! Since I want to remain anonymous, this means filling out a fake name/birthdate on BitInstant and then giving the same fake name/birthdate (plus address and phone) to the MoneyGram operator and at the supermarket (or Wal-Mart) counter worker. This seems like a bit of a hassle, but I suppose if I am going to give a false name to MoneyGram it&#039;s not much more difficult to give it to these other folks, too. I wish it was easier and that no names or birthdates were needed at any point in the process. <br /><br />I guess I understand now that if I want a more anonymous method, I will need to pay a bit more commission to use a service like Blue Sky Traders where I won&#039;t ever be asked for a name, address, phone number, or birthdate. Maybe it&#039;s worth the bit of extra commission for the total anonymity. I know that buying Bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, but I just feel more comfortable staying anonymous from start to finish and would prefer it if I never had to provide false information in order to achieve this.

				I did this last night for the first time. BitInstant/Zip Zap sent me an email with the info I needed. So I went up to my local Walmart and brought my phone with the email on it. Went to the customer service and asked to send a moneygram. She handed me a red slip but I noticed my email said grab a blue one, so I exchanged it for the blue moneygram slip.<br /><br />I then filled out the info that the email said to fill out. I also wasn&#039;t thinking and filled out my real info (name, address, etc.). But whatever, I gave the girl the slip and by the time I got home I got another email showing the Bitcoins were sent my wallet. Was extremely easy and low fees so I&#039;m definitely going to keep using this method except maybe using fake info next time. (This was my first time ever buying BTC&#039;s too I should say)

				hey guys I&#039;m planning to use the CVS method hopefully very soon as soon as I get the chance. This is going to be my first time using this method so I&#039;m naturally slightly nervous. I plan to use a semi-fake identity: (I went onto white pages.com where they list people in my area, and I&#039;m using someone&#039;s real address, similar phone number, and similar name) <br />First of all: is it ok that I used a semi-fake identity, I just dont wanna get caught using a completely fake one<br />2nd of all: how long does this procedure take typically because I just wanna do it real quick and get the hell out of there<br />3rd of all: (irrelevant question) Does anyone know of any TOTALLY LEGIT SR vendors that have cheap prices? I know these 2 attributes realistically clash, because the liars seem to charge the least amount, but still. If any of you usually use a vendor thats cheap but has got some good shit please tell me asap. <br /><br /><br />

				You guys need to try www.Bitcopia.com It&#039;s much easier and much more anonymous. You don&#039;t have to provide fake info because they don&#039;t ask you for any info except your btc address and an email if you want to give them one. If you&#039;re worried about them being legit, just look at their review thread on this forum. It&#039;s called &quot;Anyone ever tried Bitcopia?&quot; or something along those lines.

Just don&#039;t act like you have anything to hide. What&#039;s the fucking CVS gonna care? They see dozens of people all the time. But If i were you I&#039;d use semi-real info you can easily access from whitepages.com. That way if they even cared to search the address, something would at least show up.

Just don&#039;t act like you have anything to hide. What&#039;s the fucking CVS gonna care? They see dozens of people all the time. But If i were you I&#039;d use semi-real info you can easily access from whitepages.com. That way if they even cared to search the address, something would at least show up. That&#039;s the risky thing about just making random shit up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey, I&#039;m as calm as a cucumber.&nbsp; 8) I&#039;m just pointing out that, according to some people in this thread, CVS employees occasionally ask for ID while Walmart employees don&#039;t. The reason may be that Walmart is more popular with the &quot;no ID&quot; crowd, resulting in an official policy of &quot;don&#039;t ID people unless you have to&quot;, while CVS is whiter and less organized, so they don&#039;t know what the fuck they have to ID for.<br /><br />Employees are confused about this kind of shit. I had to use my US passport as an ID for a while when I was out of state and had lost my physical driver&#039;s license. There were LOTS of places (mostly dinky little grocery stores or restaurants in smaller towns) that wouldn&#039;t accept my passport because they had been instructed to only accept &quot;state ID.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This is *federal* ID,&quot; I countered. &quot;I can enter the country with this.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, no, they can print one of those at a drug store in an hour.&quot; She was evidently confusing passport photos (which you can indeed get at a CVS) with the passport itself.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />So you can see why I have an aversion to this shit... lol.<br /><br />EDIT: This is the post that currently appears right under this thread on the security page: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=97206.0

				Post by: <strong>MizunoAmi</strong> on <strong>December 29, 2012, 04:15 am</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I just wanted to weigh-in and say that when I went to CVS just now, the clerk guy at first refused to process my moneygram until I showed I.D. When I said I didn&#039;t have I.D., he said he couldn&#039;t process it.. But fortunately, I kept insisting, and he finally asked his manager about it, and the manager said &quot;I will make an exception just this once&quot;.. So, I got lucky it felt like.. And I believe some times people don&#039;t get IDed at CVS, but some times you do.. So I wouldn&#039;t really recommend CVS to any one that is using fake information..

				I have been getting the same thing when I try to get on their site. I hit proceed and it sends me to the usual looking site. Earlier today I did a deposit and it still hasn&#039;t showed up yet so maybe that has something to do with it. I would wait till the site is back to normal.

				Same with me., I proceeded to use the site despite the SSL certificate error.<br /><br />I use the bitinstant site to generate the transaction slip and go to a moneygram location. After cash payment, zipzap.com sent me emails that the payment has processed, but it has yet to post to my SR bitcoin address.<br /><br />Hopefully the site and my payment were not hijacked.

Once they verify (by whatever automated or human-labor means they might use) that funds have been received there, they can start tumbling the coins and credit the account (in this case yours) for the BTC deposit.<br /><br />Think about it - SR tumbles the coins for you, so there MUST be a delay from the time the coins are sent to the wallet address and the time they become &quot;spendable&quot; by showing up in the account.<br /><br />I suggest you deposit coins in your wallet at night, then go to sleep and check your account in the morning. If everybody did this there would never be any of those freakout &quot;Blockchain has x verifications, bitcoins still not in wallet, SR ripped me off ZOMG!11! &quot;

				okay, this isn&#039;t difficult to understand at all, but i&#039;ll try to make it as simple for you as possible.<br /><br />1. go to bitinstant.com<br />2. under the &quot;pay from&quot; drop down list, select walmart.<br />3. under the &quot;pay to&quot; drop down list, select bitcoin address.<br />4. enter your information. the first thing you&#039;ll need to input is the bitcoin address, which is where the BTC&#039;s will be sent to. i believe the limit is either $500 or $1,000.<br />5. print out your slip. there are clear instructions there. bring it with you to walmart. make sure to also bring your own pen.<br />6. go to walmart. as the instructions on your slip mention, you just need to pick up a blue moneygram form. it sits on the counter of the &quot;cash services&quot; section of walmart, which is usually near the front area. with this slip, follow instructions and fill that form out.<br />7. hand the form, with the exact amount of cash, over to the clerk.<br />8. go home and find BTC&#039;s in your wallet.<br /><br />if you still don&#039;t understand how to do this, then i&#039;m afraid there is nothing more i can say to help you. sorry.

				I am not 100% positive but I don&#039;t think it was bitinstant that was the problem. People seem to have problems with CVS asking for id. If you have a Wal-Mart that may be a better choice. <br /><br />There is no reason to check Id for sending money only when receiving cash. <br /><br />If anyone should ask what this is for you just say you are paying a bill.<br /><br />Does anyone know if it has to be a CVS or Walmart? I know check cashing places and smoke shops also have the blue forms and these places are far less likely to give you a hard time. People pay bills there all the time. <br /><br />The folks at CVS think too highly of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve done both Walmart and CVS. There&#039;s one CVS by me with the &quot;BatPhone&quot;&nbsp; ::) Red phone, you just pick it up, and an automated voice begins, enter the code, other info, etc. - Then it says, &quot;Now hang up and take your invoice to the cashier and say you want to make an &quot;express payment&quot;. One time I had trouble, and had to wait on hold, and they told me, it was because I didn&#039;t specify &quot;express payment&quot; <br /><br />Also for some reason (I think it was just the worker at this particular store), the guy said, the clerk entered the amount you gave her. (Like $115.00) Instead of what you&#039;re actually paying, which was 114.95. <br />See she entered it, to make the register make the change, but on those transactions, they gotta put the exact amount, so always go in with exact change. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter whether you print out Walmart, or choose CVS, that&#039;s basically a tool to help get you the closest Moneygram location. Say you choose CVS, but you happen to be at Walmart anyway, that&#039;s fine. - I usually look to see if there&#039;s no one on line. I was asked by CVS twice also. I made no qualms about it. Showed my id. She didn&#039;t write down my license#, just verified it was me. I know they don&#039;t have to see it, but why make a stink? - Why look guilty? - Bitcoins are legal. Those clerks don&#039;t know whether you&#039;re buying bitcoins or snakeskin boots! - If there&#039;s some awkward silence, I usually say &quot;I&#039;m refilling my kids cellphone, I use prepaid, this way I don&#039;t get stuck with an astronomical bill.&quot; Then I&#039;ll go on about &quot;Kids these days&quot;. Practically annoy the shit out of them so they just get it done and send you on your way!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Walmart seems to be more anonymous. Only difference is, Walmart, you 1st have to grab the blue form and fill it out. The info is right on the sheet you printed. - If you&#039;re out of ink or don&#039;t have a printer, just write the pertinent details on a piece of paper. It&#039;s like 3 or 4 items, and you&#039;re good to go. <br /><br />Actually one time @ Walmart, they said &quot;You&#039;re not in our system, is this your 1st time?&quot; - I realized I put a bogus phone# down. I said, &quot;Oh no! That&#039;s my old landline, you probably have my cell&quot; (which I remember using last time). - With this girl, I knew her from going to that store for years, I felt comfortable asking &quot;Why do they need that?&quot; - She said it was just to have you in the customer database, this way Walmart gets I think like more &#039;credit&#039; from Moneygram, also they can put you on their mailing list...etc. It&#039;s an internal thing for keeping track of stuff. You know how retail shops are all about that. <br /><br />Nothing to worry about. I&#039;ve been doing at least 2 bitcoin buys per month going back to April 2012. Never had an issue other than the miscellaneous bullshit I stated earlier. <br /><br />BitInstant is great! - They&#039;ve gotten a lot faster. Sometimes I&#039;ll have my laptop with me, and go sit at McDonalds (free Wifi) - and I get the message from Coinapult. Which (if you don&#039;t know) gives you a link to a page, where your new BTC&#039;s sit, and there&#039;s a field to paste your SR btc wallet address in. (or wherever you want to send them-I always go straight for SR but some feel it&#039;s &quot;good luck&quot; to tumble them in another wallet 1st).&nbsp; Sooner to SR the better, because this (lately) has been the longest wait of the whole transactiion. (Like an hour, sometimes a little more before they show on your SR account screen). Nothing like seeing that figure go from 0.00 to $150. 00 or whatever. I seriously got a chill up my spine when I 1st realized, &quot;Holy shit! It works!!&quot; - You&#039;ll want to say it even louder when the package arrives. Best to &#039;play it cool&#039; at the old mailbox.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Once sent to your SR account or btc wallet, (same thing), it&#039;s time to GO SHOPPING ! ! !&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Good Luck kiddies ! ! !&nbsp; :D <br /><br />Peace <br /><br />jagfug<br /><br />PS No 7- 11&#039;s up near me so I haven&#039;t had the pleasure. I too, bring up all sorts of other places for Moneygram, like a Sunoco station, a card store, etc.<br /><br />PPS [EDIT]- @ChemCat - Have you really been able to put your SR BTC wallet address on the BitInstant screen? That would be a first for me. If I misunderstood, sorry. Just looked like you meant that.<br />Yes BitInstant want&#039;s your date of birth. If you want to use a false one, go ahead, just &quot;remember it&quot;, because you&#039;ll need to put your email address, and if next time you put the same email address and a different birthday, it could get &#039;hung up&#039;. - - The reason they had to start that is because whatever Big Gov&#039;t watchdog, came down hard on them about &#039;appearing to be laundering&#039; and all that mess. It&#039;s not BitInstants fault. - Once again it&#039;s Big Governments fault.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				If you&#039;re talking about BitInstant, it&#039;s pinned to the time you click &#039;Go!&#039; or enter, and you arrive at the ZipZap or other money transfer site.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only gone to the $500 mark on there, and I think only once did I lose more than $10.&nbsp; Being that 1 btc = 17.69 USD. at the moment, I could see more variation happening. When I started on here back last April, it was around $4.75 = 1 btc. - Imagine that? ???<br /><br />Geez I hope my next transaction doesn&#039;t cost $30 extra bucks! :o<br /><br />That would suck dog balls :-\<br /><br />I&#039;ll expect the worst, then be surprised if it&#039;s not that bad. <br /><br />Either way, at least this fucking system still works!! <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug<br /><br />PS a great site to keep open on another browser screen is Preev.com - just shows the current exchange rate across the screen, and self re-loads. Pretty nifty tool to have at your disposal. <br />(there&#039;s a disclaimer that it&#039;s just for reference, like don&#039;t report it as fact, but it&#039;s based off of info from Gox). - Always when I get to the Silk Road checkout page, they&#039;re around .40 to .50 cents UNDER what Preev.com has.&nbsp; FYI

My personal knowledge on the actual anonymity of bitcoins is lacking but I would prefer not to have my name associated any more than necessary on an illegal transaction that could potentially have a footprint back to me.

				I had no problem at all with using a fake name at Wal-Mart. They didn&#039;t even ask to see ID. This only seems to be a problem at CVS so if they give you a problem just go someplace else. It doesn&#039;t have to be CVS or Wal-Mart. Lots of places have western union: corner stores, smoke shops etc.. <br /><br />There is no need to get so complicated as to have a friend do it for you. <br /><br />Involving other people is more likely to get you in trouble than anything else. You don&#039;t need to involve other people in your personal business. keep it as simple as possible. The more people you involve the more you increase the chances of something going wrong or getting ratted out. <br />&nbsp;<br />try just buying a very small amount of coins at first. This way you can watch, learn and get comfortable with the process. Once you go through it it will you will see it is easy and safe. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				@kleopatra +thelorax - in some strange parallel universe you might have been friends. Obviously there is a cultural difference between you. <br /><br />Having been on this planet waaay too long. Much longer than I planned. (hope I die b4 I get old), I can see value in both of your contributions to the forum. <br /><br />It&#039;s amazing how liberal someone like me, who thinks of himself as conservative, can be sometimes. <br /><br />On certain points, you&#039;re both right. <br /><br />Reduce the name calling, would be my only criticism. I believe&nbsp; you&#039;re bordering on &quot;flaming&quot;. Though I could be wrong. <br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their opinion. At least I still believe that. The country I grew up in used to be that way, but not lately. <br /><br />So I welcome the extremes of both sides of the issue, because if either were silenced, I wouldn&#039;t be getting an honest read on what my fellow earth dwellers thought. <br /><br />Good, bad, wrong or right, everybody needs to share their thoughts. <br /><br />There is no other place at this point in history, where you can find such a &quot;diverse&quot;(to use a big media BS term) cross section of people on one site. <br /><br />I hope this continues, and through the blood, sweat, and tears of it all, we can find some common ground. <br /><br />I&#039;m done with this thread. (for now)&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				A couple hours ago I used bitinstant on tor, used a tormail email, deposited cash at Walmart through MoneyGram and now my coins are sitting in my blockchain wallet. I used all fake information. I&#039;ll probably send them to another blockchain wallet and change my tor identity and then send them to SR. So stoked to be back on this site, haven&#039;t bought BTC since October. I had like $40 in my SR wallet then and now I have $80 from sitting on my ass. Lolz.

				You can still use bitinstant from within TOR, as I did so several times in the past month. The key is to use your preferred geolocation IP website and choose New Identity until you find an IP address that resolves to a location within the United States. It takes a tiny bit more time for things to load but it is worth my security. I have always used walmart and heard mixed results and bad experience stories from the CVS method with dealing with the phone and angry employees. Grab a stack of blue MoneyGram forms so you can fill them out at home and not in the store. I have never shown the zipzap printout to the employee. <br /><br />Speaking of security if any of you have had good experiences with instawallets that&#039;s great but I have not and one time when the biggest instawallet out there had problems and had to rescan the entire block chain I was locked out of my coins for days until I figured out a way to use the private keys you can save when you create an instawallet and import control of my coins into a real bitcoin wallet. So if you use instawallets ALWAYS save the private keys somehow in case the shit hits the fan in a moment when you need the coin most, like I did.<br /><br />If you want to never have to worry about instawallets crashing and being able to pull your coins out of your SR account in an important moment then get TrueCrypt or a PGP program that allows you to create entire encrypted disks. Setup a bitcoin program on your machine but point its target directory to the mounted encrypted drive with the entire bitcoin blockchain on it. I suggest sizing the encrypted drive 16GB dynamic or larger to account for the entire chain. You can use the bitcoin program through clearnet to receive your coins, as you are just listening to a message broadcast to everyone. Just setup TBB or Tor when you want to send coins to your SR account and go into the Bitcoin program settings and select to use the proxy at 127.0.0.1 and restart. Then once it has a connection you can send your coins to SR and it will be broadcast through a Tor exit node not your own machine. Dismount the encrypted drive and Bitcoin no longer can load your wallet or anything in case of compromise of security on your part. I would recommend PGP backing up your wallet.dat file though. If anyone wants more info on what I just described let me know.

I have always used walmart and heard mixed results and bad experience stories from the CVS method with dealing with the phone and angry employees.

THEY HAVE CAMERAS.. <br />then u go ahead and process the order.. <br />THEY HAVE CAMERAS<br />and then u go home and feel safer cuz it took u longer to do it on TOR?<br /><br />dudes if you want to do this nice and easy simply use it on clearnet and use fake info.. <br /><br />AND ALL U GUYS BETTER HAVE JAVA SCRIPT DISABLED ON TOR BROWSER TOO<br /><br />

				A little while back (couple weeks or a couple months), some people lost some money when BitInstant had technical difficulties. Some of the difficulties were not their fault, hack attacks, DDoS, etc. A lot of these people got their coins back after a while, but some did not.<br /><br />I used BitInstant this afternoon (now that Bitfloor is gone, RIP) after not using it for a long time. Was very nervous, but went through without a hitch, two confirmations within thirty minutes.

				BitInstant makes the transaction pretty much immediately, but how long it takes is mostly determined by the BTC network and miners... it&#039;s random. Usually done within a couple hours, but I bet that on a really busy day with lots of BTC changing hands across the network, maybe six hours, maybe longer?<br /><br />I can only speak for myself, but I feel reasonably secure using BitInstant. I have used them five times or so, and nothing so much as a hiccup. You have to keep it in mind... when we purchase BTC for SR use, most of the time we&#039;re handing a complete stranger a bunch of USD and giving them all fake information about ourselves... pretty much just asking to be robbed, no? I never deposit more than I could afford to lose outright, and knock on wood but so far I haven&#039;t been burned.<br /><br />I will probably try buying directly from a Silk Road vendor next time... the markup you pay buying with cash through BI, with fees and price differences all considered, has generally been about ten to fifteen percent. If I&#039;m going to have to pay that much now (RIP BitFloor), I might as well stay on this side of the darkweb.<br />

				I&#039;m a little confused. Bit instant says I can only do $500 per transaction. Can I do multiple transactions at the same location? That seems shady but so does going to multiple locations when they&#039;re all run through MoneyGram anyways. I miss just running in to the bank :(

				I think the main reason I&#039;m replying is because I respect your avatar and give you props for it. <br /><br />I use localbitcoins.com now. <br />As long as you do some reading on the website and pick somebody with good stats, you should be fine.

				thanks...localbitcoins.com seems to be the choice these days, another thread by Cimicon-Rep:&quot;Current List of places to get/buy Bitcoins&quot; has been analysing it. i looked into it, but i am not familiar with Perfect Money or Western Union system, and another seller then wanted my phone number confirmed and wouldn&#039;t sell to me cuz i am a newbie. another who allowed a cash bank deposit wanted $500 minimum, and it had to be confirmed within 90 minutes. wasn&#039;t ready and had to cancel.<br />slow going. and damn, i was so comfortable with bitinstant.<br />thanks for the info tho!
