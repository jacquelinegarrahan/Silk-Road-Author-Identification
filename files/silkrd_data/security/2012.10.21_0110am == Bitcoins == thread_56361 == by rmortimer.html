				Ha-ha yeah and I can give you 20btc for 20 pounds within half an hour!!! ;)<br /><br />Now seriously: use google or whatever and search for bitcoins. mt gox, bitinstant, bitstamp, blablabla. It&#039;s all pretty easy and if it&#039;s not then you probably shouldn&#039;t use SR.<br /><br />

I choose cash deposit at CVS and enter an instawallet address for the receiving address. I use a one time email and a fake phone number (remember to write these down in case you need to contact customer support) . <br /><br />You then enter how much money you want to spend on bitcoins, see MtGox.com for the exchange rate and continue. YOu enter you emial and phone number (use a fake phone number and disposable email) and then download the payment form. You then take the payment for to CVS, pick up the red phone and follow the instructions given to you on the phone (you are paying a bill). You then speak to a real person and give him the info on the payment form, you name, address (i use the info on my fake ID). You then go to the register and hand them the payment form, make sure they charge you for the whole amount including the 3.95 fee. They always card me and they look at my ID under a uv light and I&nbsp; think they know its fake because it has no UV markings but its out of state so I havent had a problem. You then pay and the bitcoins get transferred to your instawallet.<br /><br />I then transfer from the instawallet to my SR account.<br /><br />You could also try making up a fake name and address (make sure its a real address, just go on google maps) and memorizing that info. If the cashier asks for ID say you lost it or forgot it, if they give you a problem remind them that your just sending money, not recieving, so there really no gain for you ( try &quot;Come on man its bad enough I have to shell out x dollars for this bill please don&#039;t make me go home and get my ID&quot;) This will probably work. If they ask what its for just say your paying a bill for your grandmother.

				If you wanna stay almost totally anonymous, you could also just buy a ukash or paysafecard voucher looking for the nearest shop which sell them on their site. You will pay them with cash and no ID card should be required. Then you can convert them (for an HIGH fee) on Mercabit.eu or Virwox.
