				I have a question for you guys that might have an easy solution but I&#039;m a somewhat groovy nooby...<br />I recently made the switch over to Tails with a persistent chunk that&#039;s protected and all that. First off, I absolutely love it and I would rather use it than windows, really. However, my pc that I used up until now still has all of my old information on it from my prior silkroad adventures..<br /><br />My question is how should I be sure that I have removed all traces of my activity on Tor &amp; SR that is on my current harddrive? I am not ig-nant enough to think that my recycle bin takes care of this for me, but I&#039;m not a tech-person by any means. I&#039;m willing to wipe the OS if thats required; in fact, I&#039;ve considered doing this in the past anyways. I&#039;ll just back up my pictures and music with a WD hard drive and be on my way. If I do this, what are some good OS&#039;s to install in place of Windows 7?<br /><br />I should also add that I am only a personal buyer with &lt;10 total transactions so the disk isn&#039;t a goldmine of info for any LE, I would just feel safer knowing everything is disposed of. <br />Thanks in advance.

				Well, it&#039;s up to you, but the only way to remove all traces is a full disk wipe. Consider all the stuff that the browser bundle leaves behind on Windows:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148291.msg1152452#msg1152452<br /><br />Consider the difficulties of securely erasing data on a hard drive:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99520.msg699299#msg699299<br /><br />Individual file erasure is not enough.<br /><br />If you really want to get rid of all traces, you need to download DBAN (http://dban.org) and nuke your hard drive, then reinstall the OS.<br /><br />Should you do it with fewer than 10 purchases? Probably not worth it, honestly, but that&#039;s up to you.

				awesome, thanks for the quick responses astor...I&#039;m going to review these threads and see where I&#039;m at afterwards..If I were to wipe the disk, I don&#039;t have an OS to install afterwards. Maybe this is the wrong spot to ask, but what are some good OS&#039;s that I could get free? I&#039;m sure I could look elsewhere for details but maybe someone could get me started in the right direction?<br /><br />EDIT: I am a small time buyer but if I choose to move to larger quanities or to open a vendor account in the future, I don&#039;t want anything incriminating to be stuck to my drives...
