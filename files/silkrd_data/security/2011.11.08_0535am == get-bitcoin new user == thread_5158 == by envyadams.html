				I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place to be posting this, but from what I&#039;ve read get-bitcoin.com is the easiest (or one of the most convenient) ways to get bitcoin.&nbsp; I keep reading that you can go to a Wells Fargo and deposit cash, but that&#039;s where the instructions end.&nbsp; How do I go about this so I can get this process started?<br /><br />On a side note, I have Bitcoin software and I&#039;m a little foggy on once I buy the bitcoin, how do I get it uploaded on SR?&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry if these are annoying newbie questions but I want to get going and I keep running into dead ends with my questions.

				You click on their site, then click on &#039;buy&#039; and fill out the form...once you send that in, they will come back with some info--they will also email it to you--giving you account number and what not...all you really have to do is decide which bank you are going to--Wells Fargo or Bank of A.--and what btc address you want it sent to...either the wallet on your desktop, or just grab an online wallet--instawallet.org works fine.<br /><br />So, you click on the site, fill out the form, they give you an account # and transaction #....go to atm, get the amount of money you told them, then trot down to bank and deposit it--you don&#039;t need any i.d., --bank will give you receipt.<br /><br />What I do, then, is write the transaction # on my receipt, take out my smartphone and take a picture, then email this to get-bitcoin: remember they sent you an email...once they get that email, with picture of receipt, they&#039;ll deposit bitcoins...usually within an hour or two, but they get up to 24 hrs to do it...<br /><br />Then just keep an eye on the bitcoin site address you gave them...it&#039;s always cool, once you get the money, to open up another instawallet site, and send it over there, if you want to tumble your bitcoins a bit, then send them to SR...<br /><br />Lots of threads on this very subject, but anyway, not that hard...easypeasy ...<br /><br />NOte: on the form you fill out, they&#039;ll ask you what is maximum dollar amount you are willing to pay, etc...I&#039;d leave that blank...sometimes people put it too low, and get all delayed....

				Phubaiblues, how long after receiving the email that your order was processed did it take for Bitcoins to be deposited into your account? I got the email saying my order was confirmed and they sent the bitcoins around 10:30pm last night, and it&#039;s almost 8:00am now and I still have not received the funds. Seeing as how they said &quot;a few hours,&quot; I&#039;m beginning to get worried.

				Sorry I didn&#039;t answer this quicker: get-bitcoin.com, usually has delivered to me pretty quickly, once I get that comfirmation notice-2 or 3 hrs--...but I usually figure 24 hrs before I start getting worried....and I&#039;d do what you did, which is email them: they&#039;ve always replied....<br /><br />So let us know what happens, u know, when that 24hr mark gets here: I wondered if they&#039;d start slowing down once they got popular, and bitcoins, well, I always worry a little that some underworld scammers will start up one of these exchanges, but it&#039;s still about the safest and quickest we got....<br /><br />good luck

				The delay was on Mt. Gox&#039;s part, because Get-Bitcoin goes through them...I&#039;d advise all to not go through Mt.Gox if you can avoid it, they&#039;ve had several 16+hr delays on bitcoin withdrawals these past weeks.

				I used them a few days ago and never received a single email from them.&nbsp; I made the cash deposit at Wells Fargo, then sent the pic of the receipt to them and 22 hours later, had the bitcoin in my wallet.&nbsp; It could be possible I made an error when providing them my email address, I can&#039;t say at this point.<br /><br />Did you make the deposit and send them a pic of the receipt?&nbsp; If so, it&#039;s just a waiting game.&nbsp;

				Forgive my ignorance, but why would the Feds shut down ExchangeBitCoins?<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, I carried out a transaction with G-B last week and the entire process took about four days.

				I don&#039;t know any details behind ExchB closing, but if the Feds were involved, I suspect anti-money laundering/know your client laws.&nbsp; Think about it, when was the last time you heard of a online vendor accepting cash deposits for a product?&nbsp; When my wife wants to buy some shoes from Zappos.com, she doesn&#039;t go down to Wells Fargo, make a cash deposit into the Zappos bank account, email a picture of the receipt and then receive shoes in the mail.&nbsp; It&#039;s very obvious it&#039;s not completely legit.&nbsp; Especially when a company is taking in hundreds of anonymous cash deposits daily from all over the country.&nbsp; Red flags would be going up very quickly at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, then they ask where are these deposits coming from and ExchB and get-bitcoin provide them with a list of names that probably include stuff like Mike Hunt, Heywood Jablome, Munchma Quchi, etc.<br /><br />On top of that, we&#039;re not even buying a good, we&#039;re converting dollars to a digital currency.&nbsp; The Feds have shut down digital currencies in the past, most notably E-Gold.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;d be able to shut down bitcoin for so many reasons, so the Feds have to go after those who facilitate anonymous transactions.&nbsp; Well, just my two cents.

				Like most people who&#039;ve been thru the mill: started out with tradehill/mtgox thru dwolla -&gt; went to exchangebitcoins.com&nbsp; -&gt; went to get-bitcoin.com&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve been treated about like everybody else...the last two were way faster...I have heard lately now a couple people who didn&#039;t go quite so fast on get-bitcoin.com, so who knows, maybe they&#039;re slowing down, and maybe they&#039;ll go the same way exchangebtc went...but so far, so good...<br /><br />and yes, always make sure you give them correct email, and they&#039;ve always sent me *two* emails: one with all the account info (which you get on the site, when you click on &#039;buy&#039;) and the second one when they got my email with picture of transaction...with me it&#039;s been pretty quick...I&#039;m trying out other things, particularly that bitcoin-otc ... but even if I was successful, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d recommend it to newbies...it&#039;s about like here, where u&#039;ve no protection if u get scammed...worth looking at....really still hoping sumyungai will team up with anarcho and do some kind of escrow thing here...<br />
