				There is no teacher like real life experience, though its often a very harsh teacher. It would be very valuable to have a thread where we focus on collecting and discussing real cases where SR sellers actually got caught. <br /><br />How often does it happen? <br />What kind of sellers does it happen to? <br />What was the mistake they did that brought them down?

				StonedEmo, can you share the stories of the buyers? What did they do to get caught? What&#039;s their story? I think any kind of stuff like this is beneficial to the community.<br /><br />As far as OP&#039;s question, besides Trojan and Imprint&nbsp; there are many plausible methods that LE might use to catch vendors. Trying to negotiate orders outside the safety of SR, requsting use of traceable methods of payment, perhaps spreading malware, etc...I think the most interesting idea was a thread I saw here a whole ago, while I am not saying I 100% believe the OP was tied to any real LE connections, it was a very plausible scenario. It went something like:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have connections to very higher up sources, I cannot get into detail. At (some general date or near future at time of posting) LE will make multiple orders from many top vendors on SR at the same time. They are going to try and hold surveillence on many frequented mailboxes for possible deliveries you might do. Vendors beware yada dada yada.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				StonedEmo: Great links. I especially like your view on the gov. I always imagined the lot of them being hung from the trees lining the Mall in DC - but I like the idea of burning them alive too!<br /><br /><br />None of these stories are about vendors though... I am only seeing where buyers got busted. I too would be interested to know if there is any history of vendor arrests.

There&#039;s also an interesting recent news item I also saw on Reddit, about a man and his family having their house raided after a controlled weed delivery (this was somewhere in the USA). The police didn&#039;t find any other drugs in the house so there are no charges, and everyone is pretty outraged about the story, so these controlled delivery raids are getting some bad publicity in the USA right now.

				Oh I get ya now. Yeah of course I care for my buyers, that&#039;s why I put the effort in when it comes to packaging. When you read horror stories on here about vendors who clearly give less than a fuck about their packaging it just shows they don&#039;t take the risk that their customers are taking seriously and I get quite vexed about it actually. Saying that though, when I have checked my packages before I take them out and they are looking all tidy like little soldiers off to war I don&#039;t feel guilt because I know I have done my job and there is always an inherent risk with drugs via the mail and it&#039;s the responsibility of the customer to bare that risk by making the decision to use SR. As a vendor it&#039;s our job to minimize that risk and thus making you professional. :)
