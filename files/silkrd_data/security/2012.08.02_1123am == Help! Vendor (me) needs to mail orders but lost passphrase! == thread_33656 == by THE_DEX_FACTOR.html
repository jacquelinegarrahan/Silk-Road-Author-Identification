				Hi any computer genius&#039;s out there? I got my passphrases for 4 PGP keys discombobulated (don&#039;t ask me how - I&#039;m a bit stressed and rushed .... ughhh)..... I know I have them all stored somewhere? on my comp, but can&#039;t find them. I have the current key,&nbsp; fingerprint etc, but I need my particular passphrase for that current public PGP so I can decrypt some orders and get them out. I&#039;m 3 wks new to this and about 1 wk new to PGP .... If anyone has any ideas about retrieving my current passphrase for my own PGP&nbsp; key (on my page) I would love to hear from you. Thanks.<br />Cheers,<br />TDF

				I agree. Been there/done that~ makes you feel like an idiot but you just make a new key for you orders, contact any members for orders or what ever you&#039;re doing with them and include your new key in that message (so they don&#039;t have to go look for it!) and apologize, ask them to resend what ever it is they sent you and to please use that new key. <br /><br />Problem solved! <br /><br />Oh yeh, then delete all you other keys. You&#039;ll never find the pf for them, why stress on it!
