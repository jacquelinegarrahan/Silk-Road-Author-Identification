Apart from making connections to servers hard to trace to their origin it can also provide receiver privacy for<br />Internet services through a feature called &quot;hidden services&quot;. In this paper we expose flaws both in the design and<br />implementation of Tor&#039;s hidden services that allow an attacker to measure the popularity of arbitrary hidden services, take<br />down hidden services and deanonymize hidden services. We give a practical evaluation of our techniques by studying: <br /><br />(1) a recent case of a botnet using Tor hidden services for command<br />and control channels; <br /><br />(2) Silk Road, a hidden service used to sell drugs and other contraband; <br /><br />(3) the hidden service of the DuckDuckGo search engine.<br /><br />Keywords-Tor; anonymity network; privacy; hidden services<br /><br /><br />IX. CONCLUSION<br /><br />We have analyzed the security properties of Tor hidden services and shown that attacks to deanonymize hidden <br />services at a large scale are practically possible with only a moderate amount of resources. We have demonstrated<br />that collecting the descriptors of all Tor hidden services is possible in approximately 2 days by spending less than USD<br />100 in Amazon EC2 resources. Running one or more guard nodes then allows an attacker to correlate hidden services<br />to IP addresses using a primitive traffic analysis attack.<br /><br />Furthermore, we have shown that attackers can impact the availability and sample the popularity of arbitrary hidden<br />services not under their control by selectively becoming their hidden service directories.<br /><br />To address these vulnerabilities we have proposed countermeasures. These prevent hidden service directories from<br />learning the content of any the descriptors unless they also know their corresponding onion address and significantly<br />increase the resources required to selectively become a hidden service directory for a targeted hidden service.<br />However, note that the above suggestions are nothing more than stop-gap measures. We believe that the problems<br />we have shown are grave enough to warrant a careful redesign of Tor&#039;s hidden services.<br /><br />Source: http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf (clearnet)<br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />
