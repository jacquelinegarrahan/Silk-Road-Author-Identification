				When you signed up to use SR, it asks you to register your username, then password, password again and then a PIN as well.<br />This is for added security and you must input it before making every order.<br /><br />I think the theory behind the added security of the PIN is that if your account got hacked, the hackers wouldn&#039;t be able to do a whole lot with your account because they wouldn&#039;t have your PIN number.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				if you dont remember your pin after a certain number of attempts the account will be locked. then SR will contact you about resetting the pin. though unless you are respectful and convince them you will have to wait a week for them to reset it.<br /><br />the pin is just another password - not necessarily a set of numbers like at the bank<br /><br />and the pin was implemented when the old url was still used. there was a serious issue with phishing, from people clicking links on the hidden wiki and then they would enter their info on these phishing sites resulting in their coins disappearing. since the pin was required for withdrawals it prevented the unauthorized btc w/d from occurring
