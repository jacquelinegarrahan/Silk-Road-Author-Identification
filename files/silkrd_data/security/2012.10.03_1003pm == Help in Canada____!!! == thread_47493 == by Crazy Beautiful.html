				Hey everyone... I&#039;m brand new, and the Bitcoin thing is confusing me. Where/what/how is the best way to purchase Bitcoins in Canada for use here? <br /><br />Also... if I do end up getting a delivery... I don&#039;t have another address or place that is really super appropriate for a package to come to. What should I do?<br /><br />Thanks so much :)

				is there anyone out there who would have a tad bit of time over the day and a whole lot of patience... and wouldn&#039;t mind to PM with a gal in Canada? there is so much here about the bitcoins, and i&#039;m a science nerd/not a computer whiz. thoroughly confused and just don&#039;t want to jeopardize something. but am determined to make this work!! i promise that once i learn something, i&#039;m good to go. and am a pretty quick learner... <br />not sure how i could thank anyone who might possibly respond... but i&#039;m feeling so bewildered. don&#039;t want to clutter up the message boards and annoy everyone :(<br /><br />&nbsp;:&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;(&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(

				Hey Crazy,<br />Not to trying to be a dick but if you can&#039;t figure out how to purchase BitCoins and get PGP encryption to work without a personal tutorial, AND you don&#039;t have an available delivery address then maybe Silk Road isn&#039;t for you. Maybe just do a bit more research and homework, ask the odd direct and specific question (as opposed to &quot;someone show how this works&quot;) and with patience you&#039;ll get it.<br />You already figured out how get here using the Tor network so perhaps just a little more and you&#039;ll be good to go.<br />Oh, and for sure you&#039;ll need a receiving address, so .. you got your work cut out for you.

				I&#039;m also Canadian and new here and to the whole Bitcoin thing.<br /><br />I got a bitcoin.org wallet and it took a few days to download the blocks.<br /><br />I discovered that the Canadian Virtual Exchange www.cavirtex.com requires some paperwork and photo ID copies at the bank, so I didn&#039;t bother with them.&nbsp; Lazy me.<br /><br />With a simple phone call to my bank to set up a direct payment I was able to make 2 transfers from my online bank website into my wallet with www.canadianbitcoins.com and my regular email (check the SPAM folder) without even leaving home.&nbsp; It took a day for the bitcoins to be confirmed as transferred into my bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />Using my real name and a normal web browser, everything was legal up to this point.&nbsp; After this, prefer anonymity using Tor and a new alias to register on Silk Road, BlackMarket, their forums, TorMail, TorPM, etc.&nbsp; You can do business with bitcoins anonymously over the dark net but eventually you&#039;ll still need to give your trusted vendor a name and real address to be shipped to.<br /><br />I shopped around, decided what to get, and from my Silk Road shopping cart saw the bitcoin amount I needed to tranfer from my bitcoin wallet.<br />It took several hours to transfer from my bitcoin wallet to Silk Road to make my first purchase.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know of any other options in Canada.&nbsp; FYI, I have no affiliation with those sites.<br /><br />That&#039;s my .02 - hope it&#039;s helpful.<br /><br />~RutGroove<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I searched &quot;Canada&quot; for secure shipment through customs tips &amp; info to discover several<br />Canadian Bitcoin Setup threads (for someone to consolidate?):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » In Canada, need help on How-to deposit bitcoins to ewallet?:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36189.msg413702#msg413702<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Difficulty buying Bitcoins in Canada:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=43002.msg467054#msg467054<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Help in Canada????!!!:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47493.msg500896#msg500896<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Silk Road discussion » Method you use to acquire bitcoins, Canadians only please.:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47841.msg502838#msg502838<br />Also, I posted this info here:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BlackMarket Reloaded - Forums → Newbie Questions:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewforum.php?id=8<br /><br />FYI, here&#039;s an interesting post about shipping to Canada from a rogue Canadian Border Service Agent (CBSA):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11469.0<br />
