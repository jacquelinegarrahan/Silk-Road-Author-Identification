				Yes I am in the same boat as you! I deposited some funds into Bitinstant and, normally, I get emails from TrustCash within minutes about the deposit. It has been almost an hour and I still haven&#039;t received any emails to my Tormail address about the deposit.<br /><br />Also, when I try to send an email message from Tormail, I get the message, &quot;SMTP error: [451] Error while writing spool file&quot;.

				honestly, you guys should consider using alternative email providers to tormail, they already lost their .net address. we aren&#039;t sure who runs it and the password policy is quite weak.<br /><br />there are bigger providers that will help you blend in better. using tormail basically announces to the world you&#039;re doing something sketchy.

				Since so many people use Tormail here it is a given that that feds will seize those servers. Not really a problem since you are ONLY using TOR to connect. You have never sent a mail from your Tormail to somebody who knows you and of course you ALLWAYS use gpg/pgp. If you are dumb enough to use a public key that can identify you … well you are retarded.&nbsp; Just plop in a copy of TAILS and use the I2P&nbsp; mail service there. Using Windows is retarded. Was thinking about pen testing some of the application layers (SQLi) on SR. Damn I hope SR is using OpenBSD and smart enough to secure the DB structures. Got sqlmap, Arachni&nbsp; and some other goodies ready to be piped into the dark nets. If I find some shit Ill let SR know about it. All the new “weirdo” shit going on here like “spiffy” looks and the admin now talking excessively to users makes me a bit uneasy. When antisec was taken out the FBI had all ready nailed Sabu weeks before. Whats this moral BS with “no guns”?! Got that little uneasy itch under my nut sack.

				I was getting the SMTP 421 error myself last night on tormail...emails weren&#039;t sent or received. Working fine right now, but unfortunately I fear that I&#039;ve lost some bitcoins in the process. I used bitinstant through email (e.g. coinapult), received the email from coinapult late last night, but when I clicked the link the page showed up as holding 0 bitcoins, even though the email noted that the link contained my bitcoins?

				Damn, this all makes me want to steer clear of Tormail now... What about keys for PGP? When you list the email in GPA when you generate your keys, could that mean the keys are compromised if Tormail is too? I doubt it, but I&#039;d rather not be using a set of compromised keys.

I had deposited cash to Bitinstant (through TrustCash) for bitcoins.

From then on I&#039;ve always used a NEW Tormail account and a NEW PIN for each fresh transaction with Bitinstant for bitcoins. I don&#039;t know where the fault lies -- i.e. who is actually STEALING the bitcoins. Is it someone at Bitinstant, someone at Coinapult, or someone at the allegedly &quot;compromised&quot; Tormail email service?

				Thanks for clearing that up Guru, I didn&#039;t really know how Twitter works.<br /><br />On the other hand, just because Tormail tells customers to use PGP if they want better privacy, they can still be a honeypot. It just makes them to be seen more legit.<br /><br />But since non of the email providers are safe, and anyone of them can be or become a honeypot my question was rather pointless.<br /><br />Anyway my main question was supposed to be:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone ever experienced missing sent or incoming mails in the past? Not just now when Tormail has/had obviously some problems.

				IMO, there are a couple of possible reasons for Tormail&#039;s existence.<br /><br />1. Civic minded civilians. Yes, this is possible.<br />2. An intelligence agency is doing something like the following:<br /><br />2.1 By analyzing the network topography of emails sent they can work out the relative importance of the users.<br /><br />For example, responses from a boss to most underlings are likely to be relatively brief, whereas a report from an underling could be pages. Even with padding, this could be obvious with a large enough sample. Of course it would be far more sophisticated than what I&#039;m describing, this is just an idea. Basically the users sort themselves in a kind of pattern which can be interpreted.<br /><br />2.2 Then, once a target is selected, the agency brings the full power of a distributed network to brute force to obtain the target&#039;s private key. From then on, it is easy to exploit downstream.<br /><br />So, any plaintext intercepted from the naive is really just icing on the top.<br /><br />3. It is run by the equivalent of long con selective scammers hunting for interesting titbits for blackmail etc, esp. since almost certainly some pedophiles use the service. Given that I believe the RBN corporation controls this service, this would tally up. The US nationals might be in Germany, but I think the servers are in Russia.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Whether the reality, diversification is required. If SR is to come under attack then Tormail could also be a target. However, I think that will mean the FBI will have overstepped the mark into a hornets nest given who I believe runs Tormail and also the composition of Tormail end users. Unless 2.0 is true, in which case they could be negotiating some selective attack by removing SR accounts.<br /><br />Finally, while there are other services on the darknet that provide channels of communication, it concerns me that if you attacked two hosting services then it could make life somewhat difficult to regroup.<br /><br />Hence, we require a truly decentralized support mechanism that is easy to use, even if it&#039;s a bit slow. Do you have any suggestions? What about the Association of Aquatic Mammals. Can they help us? :)<br /><br />

I think you were a bit tired when you wrote that, got to admit I read it the way you wrote it the first time :)<br /><br />Yeah, it is interesting that there is a lack of Tor based email providers for sure. I think that&#039;s partly a result of jurisdictional issues e.g. having the physical servers someplace where the government isn&#039;t necessarily going to kowtow to the U.S government or other ones. e.g. Russia, China (the irony).<br /><br />I think the practical issue is, like another person said, that while you might have a hidden service, you still need some nodes outside the Tor network, otherwise you&#039;re stuck with just an internal email system for Tor like TorPM. So, that node(s) is going to be seize-able as a result, hence the jurisdictional challenges. There ought to be some elegant privacy enhancing method (Guru was talking about a.a.m, but I don&#039;t know enough about it). There is probably already a solution in some crypto academic journal some place, but maybe it&#039;s not so well known.<br /><br />Yup, this could all be FUD, but then again Applebaum has been dogged by the FBI for long enough to obtain the correct type of intuitive paranoia. Besides like I said already, there&#039;s the more fundamental question of diversification. There ought to be a kaleidoscope of publicly available Tor based email services, I mean it&#039;s 2012, not 1995. <br /><br /><br /><br />
