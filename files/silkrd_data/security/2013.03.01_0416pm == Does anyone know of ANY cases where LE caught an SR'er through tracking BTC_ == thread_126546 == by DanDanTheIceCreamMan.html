				Just seeing if anyone has heard of any instances where someone has gotten caught using silk road because LE tracked their BTC purchase and tracked that purchase and saw it deposited to SR? I hear alot of people warning about that but I haven&#039;t heard of LE actually doing it.

				Nope. Like thelorax said. Theyll wait for an eager, idiotic soul to sign for a drug pack and discover their SR involvement through a raid. BTC are used and accepted by companies and im sure the police are busting down their doors for bitcoins.

				No. Like everyone else said they will wait till you receive s package. <br /><br />It would be very hard for bit coins to be tracked. If its possible at all. <br /><br />Lots of people worry about this step. Remember BTC are legal to own and can be purchased anonymously for extra protection.<br /><br />Good luck and stay safe.

				ok thanks guys I appreciate your insight on this. I&#039;ve always seen people talking about tumbling coins to different addresses so as not to be traced but I&#039;ve never heard of any instances where this has happened.<br />I know it wouldn&#039;t be very smart to do but if someone was to make a bank transfer in their own name to an exchange and then sent those btc&#039;s directly to SR would it really matter?

				I was actually flamed by some guy yesterday for telling a thread full of btc paranoiacs that they can chill when it comes to buying and transferring btc. He told me that I would appreciate all this random wallet shuffling, online wallet aquisition, third party btc tumbling, wearing a fake mustache to deposit cash nonsense when sr gets &quot;compromised&quot; lol, whatever the fuck that means.. I mean even if dpr was possessed by obama himself he isn&#039;t going to start laying down convictions because they&#039;ve been tracking your btc hahaha.. As for le seeing you deposit coin into sr... well thats an alice in wonderland scenario at very very very best<br />Sorry for sounding like an asshole.. the ignorant paranoiacs get me all worked up sometimes. And to all you out there who fall into that catagory, I still love you guys.. you just frustrate me sometimes&nbsp; :-*<br />

				I think you miss the point, Sirius.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very real concern for vendors who have to regularly cash out hundreds or thousands of bitcoins.&nbsp; You don&#039;t come up with that kind of quantity from mining.&nbsp; And they can easily check and notice that there haven&#039;t been any sizable quantities won at the online gambling sites recently.<br /><br />... so where are the things coming from, and why is it a stream of BTC and not USD?&nbsp; Tax evasion.&nbsp; Money laundering.&nbsp; Conspiracy to commit fraud.&nbsp; Etc., etc., etc..&nbsp; Buyers aren&#039;t the only ones who have to deal with BTC, after all.&nbsp; But yes, I agree... to worry about getting caught from spending less than 100 BTC every few weeks is probably pretty silly.&nbsp; They have more pressing matters, I would think.<br />

I suppose if it&#039;s rather meager quantities, say 80 to 200 coins at a time, it would be enough to mix up the coins real well and then use diverse means of cashing out, right? I mean varying it from silly things like moneypaks, to selling coins on the up and up (like the mount) and sending to bank accounts, and another time using reloadable cards, and finally doing things like localbitcoins.com.<br /><br />Whattaya think?

				LE are actually pretty stupid, just read the news, they do the stupidist shit all the time. Most of em only have a highschool degree afterall, but dont let that stop the area51bildeburgilluminatinwo crowd from telling you the government is some god like entity. Hell, just contact a government office and ask them to do something routine. You&#039;d be lucky if they spoke clear enough english to understand you.

I was jabbing at all of the guys posting questions about whether or not their gambit over 10 btc is adequate to keep the man off of their back.. It is energy that these guys could be throwing into some useful precautions. It&#039;s often the stupid mistakes that get you in the end.. not some all seeing all knowing mystical big data god-hand of the united states govt.<br />My apologies for not specifying, I can be a dickhead sometimes...

				I lolled irl at the &quot;wearing a fake mustache&quot; part.<br /><br />I agree, I&#039;d be stressed as hell being a vendor sitting on a big pile of BTC and cashing it out. Not because of LE but the Tax guys can be pretty tough when you get their attention.

IMO any LE tracking btc payments would be only be look for very high profile individuals. In any case, if the individual washes their coins correctly, LE will fail. All busts so far on SR it seems are from IRL mistakes.
