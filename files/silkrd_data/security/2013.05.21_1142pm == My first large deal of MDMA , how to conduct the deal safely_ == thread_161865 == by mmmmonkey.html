				I&#039;ve been introduced to a buyer who wants 30g of MDMA. This is 10x more than my previous largest order.<br /><br />I only sell to friends, friends of friends. This person who wants to buy is a close friend of a good friend of mine. A 30g order is a pretty big deal to me. I want this transaction to go as smoothly as possible, while remaining as ghost as possible. How should I do this?<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking that I might ask for half the money up front, wait til I get the order, and ask for the money to be given to my friend to give to me. He is willing to be the middle man. My name and number won&#039;t be provided to anyone in the transaction, and my friend will change my name in his phone, delete our conversations and possibly delete me off facebook. <br /><br />Is there anything else I should be wary of?

				I would go the middleman route, the less people I have to meet the better, especially people I don&#039;t personally know.

				No he definitely understands the risk, he&#039;s being the middle man because he doesn&#039;t want me to get screwed over / be directly involved. Apparently these are the type of people that if I screw them over, they&#039;ll come looking for me. But I won&#039;t screw them over, especially if they&#039;re buying 200 caps worth of product. I don&#039;t fuck people over, I&#039;ve been told I&#039;m one of the most reliable sellers they&#039;ve met because I&#039;m always on time, I give discounts to returning customers and whatnot, I run this like a proper business. <br />But when my usual sale is 10-15 caps and 200 comes out of no where, it makes me kinda weary about it. Maybe I&#039;m getting set up or something, so I wanna stay as far from the buyers end as possible. <br />And my good friend who introduced me to this dude , I trust him a lot. I&#039;m thinking I should just get half the money first, order the product, wait til it gets in, get the rest of the money, and then give him the product a day or two after. And give the people I&#039;m selling to a ball park time frame of when to expect the goods.

				Not sure if I&#039;ve read it wrong but... Sounds like your getting in over your head. Sounds like your selling product before you actually have it. If you don&#039;t have the product in your hands, don&#039;t make the deal. I recommend starting off by selling him a quarter oz with the promise of more to come, give him the quarter at oz prices and everyone will be happy and they will understand and you will then have the funds to purchase an oz without relying on 50% upfront. Also, try not to short yourself on stock for your regular customers by chasing a one off large deal even though it may be tempting.

				@Tyrion - probably about 700-1000 depending on if there are events going on or whatever. And I only deal to friends or friends of friends (So far about 15 different people, 4-6 of which come back on a weekly basis.<br /><br />@someoneelse87 - Probably not a good idea, hey? In case my order doesn&#039;t come or something... hmm. I won&#039;t have the funds to order what he wants unless he gives me some/all to start with. I could ask for a &quot;deposit&quot; maybe, use that money to order some of what he needs, then get more after he gives me the rest. They want to try 4 caps before they decide to get a bigger order.<br /><br />@jack n hoff - yeah, I doubt I would ever do kilos worth of deals, holy crap. Maybe ounces here and there though lol. I&#039;ve been unemployed for a few months and now I have 2 jobs so this is all just saving money for me.

				You should have the 4 testers on hand, right? Give him those at full price and tell him that you don&#039;t have huge amounts of stock but let him know you CAN get it - just takes some work &amp; time. This will take you out of the firing line for being ripped off, you do not want people thinking you hold keys. Don&#039;t go from 4 caps to 200, maybe offer him 50 caps and offer them at a time when there are no events coming up so your usual sales shouldn&#039;t be effected. If you want to deal at this level, don&#039;t let a cent from the 50 sale hit your pocket, use the profit to reup and offer him a bigger deal when he is not expecting it as much and tell him the deal is only good until tomorrow or it&#039;ll be sold to a bigger buyer or some bullshit.<br /><br />Remember that he is asking you for the oz because he can&#039;t get it elsewhere, he wants shit from you - not the other way around. You have a job so you don&#039;t NEED this money, it&#039;s just savings so shouldn&#039;t matter if you complete the deal now or in 1 month time when your more setup. Making him wait and giving the impression that your working hard to sort this out for him won&#039;t hurt, just don&#039;t promise anything and don&#039;t fuck people around.<br /><br />Also, is this guy in your local area? Because if he is you are probably setting up competition for yourself, not sure if that&#039;s a problem but something to keep in mind anyway. <br /><br />Good luck!

				@ someoneelse - exactly. This isn&#039;t something that I need to do. sure it would be nice but I&#039;m not gonna make this a priority until I know they&#039;re serious. Plus the competition part. Chances are if they&#039;re buying 200 caps worth, they&#039;ll be cutting it with other things. They probably have more people who will want to buy and who they&#039;ll want to sell to, out of my reach. Once they&#039;re out of it, they&#039;ll come back to me for more. I know they don&#039;t sell to the people I sell to, my customers are loyal, they know they&#039;re getting the best uncut goods from me so they won&#039;t stray unless I&#039;m out of product. <br /><br />@ users - no i&#039;m not discussing this on facebook lol

				Sell to him in 2+ separate times for the same discounted price as if you were to sell in a lump some.<br /><br />EX)<br /><br />Sell 15g tuesday and 15g wed (when u re-up) but give it to him at the price you would sell to him if he bought all at once. <br />Dont get too ambitious it seems like you have a solid system of who you sell to and stuff keep it up dont take too many chances.<br />

				The safest way to do this is to not do it at all. However, if you are going down this road, a few suggestions:<br /><br />1. All money up front, with your associate as the middleman. This is the only way to 99% guarantee a smooth transaction. You&#039;re established, and it sounds like this individual is some nobody whom no one besides your associate can vouch for. You have all the credibility; he has none. Therefore, he can trust you much more than you can trust him (and you can&#039;t).<br /><br />2. Start small. Divide the transaction into separate, smaller transactions, such as a quarter oz. If he has a problem with this, he was likely planning something in the first place (in which case you must sever ties with your associate).<br /><br />3. Always use dead drops after a successful transaction is performed.

				Not to ruin your day or make this harder than it has to be, but that&#039;s exactly like how LEO operates. They get your friend in a small buy and bust, then want HIM to help get the next guy up the chain. I don&#039;t think that you are increasing your security by involving your friend. At least let your friend know that by facilitating a drug deal, if it&#039;s a Federal rap, can get you ten years. That&#039;s right, he can introduce you to someone that he knows that deals to you, and if they can prove that it&#039;s a ten year sentence. <br />If you have&#039;t met the guy, tell him (somehow) that you don&#039;t want to meet any new people. Do it via Silk Road, although I know it&#039;s $500 for a vendor. That would be safe. <br />Statistically, it&#039;s probably OK, but that&#039;s my advice, you need a system for new people, and Silk Road sr something like that is a safe way, esp if you PGP your vendor your address, leaving even SR out of the loop. <br />Your security should be redundant, if something goes wrong, you&#039;ve already thought of that and you aren&#039;t compromising your security. <br />Let us know how it went. <br />If we don&#039;t hear back from you-well anyway write when it&#039;s done.

				Also seems like what ever your friends do for HIS security system will necessarily involve you, in the arrangement you have outlined. <br />Maybe change locations at THE LAST MINUTE. <br />You gotta think about robbery too. <br />I&#039;d see if somebody ELSE knows this guy too, not just your one friend.

				Yeah exactly, I&#039;ll have to trust my gut on this one. Another thing would be what if the product doesn&#039;t arrive for whatever reason. I&#039;ll have his money, no product, I&#039;ll be killed lol. I should probably do 5 gr, then 10 gr, then 20 gr over the span of a month and play it safe that way. More smaller packages, less chance of having it ALL caught at once.
