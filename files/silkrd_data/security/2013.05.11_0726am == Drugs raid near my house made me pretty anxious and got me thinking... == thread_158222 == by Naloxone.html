				When I got home a few nights a go, I delayed this post for a while just out of paranoia, I saw some police vans near my house. A friend told me that it was a drugs bust and I shat myself. I was expecting to get back to see my room trashed and some cops ready to take me away. Fortunately it wasn&#039;t me.<br /><br />It got me thinking though, what sort of value of drugs would you need to have for them to bust you with sniffer dogs and 3 police vans? I tend to only buy enough for myself but the amount I have for myself could probably be enough to get charged for dealing.<br /><br />I was thinking the cost of the raid, planning etc. the value must have been about $10,000. Am I completely wrong in my thinking? Would they do a bust for a relatively small amount? I&#039;d say my stash would come to $500 at the most.<br /><br />Sorry if this has been asked before. Nothing like this came up in my searches.

				Haven&#039;t you ever watched cops? I&#039;ve seen them do more than that for negros slangin&#039; a couple rocks or for petty weed.<br /><br />It is very dependent on where you live. You can have more weight in a major city without them going all SWAT on your ass. $500 of drugs is a lot to a police force in the middle of nowhere that usually gets called out for DUIs, domestics and other petty nonsense.

				It depends on where you live and if the police department is inundated with other more serious work. If they have a &quot;slow day&quot; they&#039;ll bust anyone for anything!

				You guys are right in the sense that it is heavily dependent upon where you live. But I&#039;d like to clear up the small town big city thing. It depends on the town and it depends on the city and state period. I operate out of a small town, task force mainly focuses on cocaine and heroin. Everything else is done by chance (traffic stops, domestic disputes, fights etc.). Also, a lot of smaller poor towns (Like the places I deal with) don&#039;t generate enough taxes to fund long term drug surveillance operations. Also remember that most drug busts nationwide come about through informants. Yes the police can get wiretaps and shit like that but they have to have the resources for it. Why bother having those resources when so many people are willing to talk and give up all the info they need, and procure the sales for them? Be careful who you fuck with.

				The drug seizure amounts are just for bragging rights, the real motivation is the cash I&#039;m guessing. Anything they find they will tie to the drugs and it&#039;s means more cop gear they get to go buy. Like little kids at X-mas when they get the cash.

				Thanks for the info guys. I think I&#039;ll maybe use up the stuff I&#039;ve got at the moment before buying much more then. Other than essentials obviously!<br /><br />Sometimes I don&#039;t think I&#039;m paranoid enough. Need to smoke more grass!

				Nothing wrong with being paranoid, withing reason, but look at it this way. - Whoever got busted that night, probably wasn&#039;t buying from SR. It was &#039;word of mouth&#039; - dealing brazenly, some kid probably, just feeling like MR Man with his first taste of dealing. My guess age bracket of 19-25.&nbsp; Word of mouth.
