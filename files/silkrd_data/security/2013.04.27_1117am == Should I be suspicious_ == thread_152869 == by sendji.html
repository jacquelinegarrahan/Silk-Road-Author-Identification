				My apologies if this is in the wrong place.<br /><br />I just had a domestic order cancelled by the vendor for the first time.&nbsp; My order history is flawless with 0% auto-finalize and 0% refunds and I use PGP encryption for my address.&nbsp; The vendor sent no message as to why (s)he cancelled the order, and I only got the &quot;no reply&quot; message from the system.&nbsp; Do I have cause for concern, like the vendor fishing for buyer addresses?&nbsp; I know most LE are probably after the vendors themselves, but are any after the buyers as well?&nbsp; I just can&#039;t understand why they would cancel a sample-sized order from a buyer with a flawless record, and the item is still listed.<br /><br />

				Well, I would have put the vendor&#039;s name already, but I didn&#039;t know how cool it would be to call him or her out on the forums, especially when they now have my name and address.&nbsp; I guess I should message that vendor and ask why it was cancelled and report back here first.

				He just ran out of samples dude.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or can&#039;t commit to the order because he&#039;s going away or something.&nbsp; Consider it a good thing. Many would take yur order, and leave it sit for the maximum time , and then put it in transit.<br /><br />If he&#039;s new then he likely sold all his shit in real life on the side. And didn&#039;t update his vendor page stock amount.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Noob mistake.&nbsp; Always update the&nbsp; inventory.
