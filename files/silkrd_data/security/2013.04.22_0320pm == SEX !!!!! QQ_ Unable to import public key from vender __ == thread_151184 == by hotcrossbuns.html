				I too need help with gpgp on my mac.<br /><br />I want a very simple solution, where I can encrypt something (Address in this case) with someone elses public key. Thats it. I only find these things (like GPGtools) that integrate deeply in the system, but I dont need that at all. I want to be able to encrypt something to someone using their key, and then get rid of the whole software asap. I dont want LE to find anything fishy from my computer if (when) they bust my door.<br /><br />1: Import key<br />2: write something<br />3: click &quot;encrypt&quot;<br />4: copy &amp; paste to SR<br />5: delete the whole thing.<br /><br />Is there anything like this for the mac?

				the latest version of Mac OS and GPG don&#039;t work together smoothly. so far there is no workaround. but there is a software that does the trick, it&#039;s called SimpleGPG encrypt.

				Hotcrossbuns, I think were on the same boat here. We need to encruypt our addresses for our vendors, and we use a mac. <br /><br />I wasn&#039;t able to even install GPGtools (which contains GPG Key Chain Access) on a USB -drive, only option was to install to the drive OSX was installed to. After launching, first thing I see is Safari starting up, then i have to generate my own key. The same with you?<br /><br />I stopped right there, as I understood that the only thing I can encrypt with the thing is email? <br /><br />I think, though, that to import a public key, you need to save it to a file and then point GPG key chain access to it. The &quot;tutorial&quot; on the site also said that in order to encrypt something you have to have an account set up in Mail, and recipients addresses in your address book blah blah. Like so:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: GPGtools</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You need:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a secret key matching the mail address you want to write from (see Mail.app &gt;Settings &gt; Accounts)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the public key of the recipient<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; recipients and senders mail address have to perfectly match the mail addresses in the keys being used<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Important: For the encrypt button to become available you need to enter the recipients mail address - only then will that button be enabled (if you have the according sec key).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now this is something I dont want to do<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151184.msg1042375#msg1042375">Quote from: connoisseur on April 22, 2013, 05:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the latest version of Mac OS and GPG don&#039;t work together smoothly. so far there is no workaround. but there is a software that does the trick, it&#039;s called SimpleGPG encrypt.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You mean this one?<br />http://search.cpan.org/~cmcosse/Crypt-SimpleGPG-0.3/lib/Crypt/SimpleGPG.pm<br /><br />I have no clue how that should do the trick, I have no idea about the command line...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ENCRYPTING:<br />&nbsp;my $gpg = Crypt::SimpleGPG-&gt;new(home_dir = &#039;/home/user/.gnupg&#039;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; $gpg-&gt;import_key(&#039;/path/to/public/key&#039;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; my $ciphertext = $gpg-&gt;encrypt($plaintext, $recipient);</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				God the lighting speed of tor is making my day easy :/<br /><br />Yeah I&#039;m not sure we are quite in the same boat chap,<br />so far I seem to be able to import certain keys but its very picky..<br />For example I dont think it likes GNU/Linux :/<br /><br />Thanks for the threads will have a read. Tsygootti I will message you if <br />I get somewhere and vis versa, us Macers gotta look out for each other<br />we are dangerously out numbered.

				It is unlikely that this is an interoperability issue with GPG itself (public keys should be importable anywhere), it almost certainly is something to do with the fact Mac software for GPG is wildly more complicated to setup and use than it ought to be, as well as the many bugs that GPGTools appears to have from the continual outcry we hear about it on here. If you&#039;re using Mountain Lion OSX, you need a different version of GPGTools than the one for Lion or Snow Leopard, the &quot;nightly install&quot; I think it&#039;s called.<br /><br />This is one advantage of the command line, it&#039;s almost identical no matter what operating system you&#039;re on. Without meaning to be a jerk, being a Mac user may not be a good idea in general when using SR. There is a bunch of esoteric computer problems that can fuck with you, such as how Mac/Windows/Linux don&#039;t use the same newline characters. So if you save a text file with a PGP key created with Mac, and send it to a Linux or Windows user as a plaintext text file attachment, they&#039;re not able to import it.<br /><br />One particular bugbear I found recently wasn&#039;t an EOL issue although I thought it was at first, but I mean look at this example:<br /><br />http://www.thismachinekillssecrets.com/contact/<br /><br />This journalist wrote an entire book on Cypherpunks and PGP. Now look at his PGP key. You can&#039;t import his public key. It&#039;s easily solvable using the &lt;pre&gt; tag in the HTML source, but it&#039;s not exactly the most intuitive problem, a noob would be utterly poleaxed by something like that.<br /><br />All of the fucked up situations with garbled PGP keys I&#039;ve seen are correlated to whether the user has a Mac, even when the Mac itself is not the problem. The idea that Macs are easier to use is a total myth from where I&#039;m standing. They give you bad habits and stupid ideas about how computers work. I know people are always having holy wars over non-existent differences between OSes, but I think what I&#039;m saying is an objective fact, it can be measured, Science!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				thanks for the time put into write that, <br />I have since sorted the problem, lucky lucky.<br /><br />I like my apple Mac I may not be able to write code etc etc, <br />but hey its a really useful tool as for safety on SR for what<br />I am doing on here it is fine.<br /><br />Besides this idea that everyone should learn to write code use linux<br />etc etc. I have a lot of respect for people who are really fluent in IT<br />but its not for everyone. There are many skills to learn in life, <br />you can&#039;t get through the all.<br /><br />To me a computer is just a tool, a means to an end. The tool<br />I&#039;m using at the moment provides me with the results I need,<br />be it slower etc. <br /><br />For anyone with the same GPG problem check out this thread here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=144403.0)<br /><br />Easy xx<br /><br /><br />
