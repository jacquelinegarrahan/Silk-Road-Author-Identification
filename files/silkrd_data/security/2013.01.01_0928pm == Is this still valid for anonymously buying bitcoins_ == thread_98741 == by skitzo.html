				1. Getting Bitcoins<br /><br />People all have their own methods on how to get bitcoins, but here&#039;s how I do it which works great and is completely anonymous. Also this is only for the<br />United States as far as I know.<br /><br />First create a Mt Gox account. Mt Gox is a great bitcoin exchange but they now unfortunately flag anyone accessing their site through Tor. So I went to<br />my local library and made my Mt Gox there. Use a disposable e-mail to sign up for Mt Gox and make sure to only access it at a computer not associated<br />with you (such as the library). Write down your Mt Gox account number, as you&#039;ll need it in the next step.<br /><br />Now go to &quot;bitinstant.com&quot;. This is a middle-man service that lets you deposit cash at a local bank and get bitcoins in your Mt Gox account within<br />MINUTES. Select &quot;Cash Bank Deposit&quot; as the payment method, &quot;Mt. Gox&quot; as the destination, type in your account number as the destination account,<br />and lastly put an e-mail that IS NOT the e-mail you used to create your Mt Gox account (I would suggest getting a Tormail). The bottom of the page will<br />give you a quote with the amount you will receive after their fees have been subtracted.<br /><br />Hit &quot;Send Funds&quot;. Then press the big green &quot;Click to Pay Now&quot; button. You&#039;ll be redirected to the TrustCash website. Go through the steps and make sure<br />to print a copy of your invoice at the last page. You have 3 days to deposit the cash before the invoice will expire. Take the invoice to the bank you<br />chose in the steps, tell the teller you&#039;d like to deposit the money into the account detailed on the invoice, and hand him/her the exact amount specified.<br />If he/she starts asking questions, just say you&#039;re trying to get started in the forex trading market.<br /><br />=======<br /><br />I thought Mt.Gox required ID or something along those lines and wouldn&#039;t a teller at the bank as for your ID if you were sending cash? I hope this is still a valid article so I can go purchase some damn coins finally!

				@CaptainMal<br /><br />So the best option with BitInstant would be to do the bitcoin to email process? And regarding the name requirement, that&#039;s safe to do?

				Well I see that bitinstant offers Cash Deposit for Walmart/CVS/MoneyGram....I know you can do MoneyGram at Walgreens from what I understand.<br /><br />So say I went to Walmart to do a cash deposit directly to my wallet, all they ask for is name/dob/address kind of like a western union form? Guess I could call them and just ask what is expected but Ill wait for a response here :) &lt;3

				Yes, a MoneyGram only requires that you give Name DOB and address. USE ALL FAKE NAMES DOBS AND ADDRESS! just remember the info you give them. The only thing I think they ask you for is your name at the register (at least this is all I get asked) Through bitinstant there is a 7% fee on the money you send (I always use cash at cvs --&gt; BTC address) and then a 3.95$ fee from the company zip zap. so take that into account as well. They will not ask you for ID or anything of that nature. Just use the money gram phone to confirm your payment then go to the register and tell them you are there to pay a bill via money gram and they will ask for the amount (NOTE: that if you send 200$ through bitinstant you will pay 203.95 BEFORE FEES at the register, but there are no fees from moneygram, just the extra 3.95$ from zip zap!) and your name, and then you sign a receipt and your coins are in your acccount before your home to check on them

				The lady ID&#039;d me last time I went and it was a very small amount of money. She let me make the deposit anyway but I felt sketched.

				Also if you read the bitinstant website they clearly state that they now work with the feds and check info now. They say its to cross check names with criminals but I bet it looks sketchy if they see a fake name come up too.

				What if you don&#039;t wanna keep using fake info cause you&#039;re worried about them catching onto you? Is there anyway to use your real info while not pointing them directly to your SR account?

				I&#039;m sorry, I would but Blue Sky Traders seems to be the way to go with their 0% fees.

				Remember the FBI raided Bitinstant and took servers. That&#039;s why bank deposit and most other methods stopped for awhile, then they made deals and some forms came back.<br /><br />Would be very sure that any transaction via bitinstant is directly and heavily watched/scrutinized. Stay away.
