				Hey everyone,<br /><br />I love this place. My question is as follows: Let&#039;s say the DEA knocks on my door, looks around, and finds that there are no drugs to be found. Can I still be held liable from the record of the transaction on SR? Is it safe to think that once the drug is used up, then it&#039;s clear sailing? Or can I be held responsible even after the drug has been consumed?

				It&#039;s not illegal to have taken drugs or to have been high.<br />In most countries it&#039;s also not illegal to buy drugs.<br />It is illegal to have drugs in your possession in most countries, and even more illegal to have enough drugs to be considered a &quot;trafficker.&quot;<br />Most countries also have laws against the illegal importation of drugs.<br />It is also illegal, in most countries, to sell drugs even in small quantities, and in many countries it&#039;s illegal to be &quot;publicly intoxicated.&quot;<br />If it was illegal to have been high, you would not see so many of these rock and roll &quot;tell all&quot; biographies.

				If the drugs are all gone there is nothing to worry about. Also, I would like to note that there would be no idea that the drugs in the mail were related to SR. Nothing in the packages has any association with this website, so you don&#039;t need to worry about them finding records on SR. Another note, if it was an international order, customs intercepts it and then sends you a nice little love letter saying to not do it again. If they caught a large amount (possible intent to sell) then they would do a controlled delivery. That works by having LE wait by your mailbox and then strike once you got inside and opened the package. That&#039;s why a lot of people say to wait a atleast a day to open anything. Never would LE just randomly show up at your door to search for anything without a warrant first. It just doesn&#039;t happen.

				Most states in the US have laws against &quot;conspiring&quot; to buy drugs. So the act of making a plan to purchase drugs is a crime. Some states, like Nazi California, also have laws that make it a crime to be high on drugs. They do these ignorant little tests with your eyes and lock you up despite the fact no drugs are present. That being said, once the drugs are gone and you are down it would be hard for them to make a case even in those terrible places. I&#039;m no computer expert, but wouldn&#039;t it be hard for LE to get your SR info due to Tor? Wouldn&#039;t they need your pswrd and all that? The shit has truly hit the fan or you are your own snitch if that happens, right?
