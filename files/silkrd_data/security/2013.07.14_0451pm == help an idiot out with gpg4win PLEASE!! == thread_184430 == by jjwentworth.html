				hi guys im trying to do the community a favor and learn this encryption bullshit. i know theres already hundreds of threads on pgp tutorials but i need help in lamens terms. i downloaded gpg4win. it only gave me a private key. the key is like 6 letters and numbers hardly the 12 lines of letters and numbers im accustomed to seeing on vendors pages stating there public keys. it also never gave me a public key so i assumed i would just make a new key and designate one of those keys to being my public key and the origional one supllied to me to be my private key. again the second key generated was only like 6 letters and numbers not the 12 lines im used to seeing. as of this point can someone tell me if they think im doing this right up till this point? im also having trouble sending a message to my friend who is also just trying to learn this but ill save that issue until someone can tell me if what i explained so far sounds correct. please help

				You dont need to run gpg4usb in Tails, it comes with an encryption/decryption applet already installed.

				I FULLY agree with everyone here suggesting GPG4USB, Its what I downloaded when I first found the road and was learning about one important aspect of it called PGP encryption &quot;what the fuck is that???&quot;<br /><br />trust me and everyone here that is suggesting it, you will thank yourself and everyone here, it is perfect for people trying to grasp the concept, you will be making orders in no time .<br />

				On a related note, your PGP encrypted address is rendered useless if the vendor sends you a tracking number in plaintext, because an adversary can use that number to find your address. Tracking numbers are actually worse, because addresses are deleted when the order is marked In Transit, usually within a couple of days, while tracking numbers will be stored in SR messages for 3 months, even after they are deleted.<br /><br />If you encrypt your address, you should instruct the vendor not to send you a tracking number, but then again, they should be smart enough to figure that out for all of their customers who encrypt their addresses.<br />

Then copy the encrypted message and paste it in a PM to the recipient and send it.<br /><br />6. REMEMBER - Include your Own Public Key in this message if you wish to receive an encrypted response from the recipient. You can find this by RIGHT-CLICKING your key in KEY MANAGER, then copy/pasting it. :)
