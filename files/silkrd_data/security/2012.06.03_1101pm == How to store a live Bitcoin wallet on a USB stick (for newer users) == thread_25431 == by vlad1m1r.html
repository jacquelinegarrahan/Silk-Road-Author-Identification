				Dear all,<br /><br />A poster reminded me earlier today that when you install Bitcoin software on to a USB stick, the crucial wallet.dat file itself which you need in order to view and spend your Bitcoins is actually stored on your machine. (See : https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet) <br /><br />This can cause problems if your computer is seized or crashes. If you prefer to boot from a Live CD like TAILS to browse Silk Road and so cannot store your wallet.dat on a local machine but would rather not trust using an online e-wallet, this may also be an option for you.<br /><br />As such I have put together a (hopefully!) simple step by step guide as to how to keep the QT Bitcoin client software on a USB stick entirely for people using Linux. Even if you don&#039;t ordinarily use a Live CD such as Tails or Ubuntu you might want to do so in order to set this up as it&#039;s more secure.<br /><br />For newer users I would strongly recommend backing up your wallet.dat file before doing this by following the steps in the above link. You should also encrypt your USB stick using either Linux&#039;s disk utility or Truecrypt. There&#039;re plenty of guides as how to to do this online but do ask for help if you need it.<br /><br />The tutorial can be downloaded from http://utovvyhaflle76gh.onion/sTORage/vlad1m1r/books/BitcoinUSB/Bitcoin%20Wallet%20tutorial%20%2D%20Vlad1m1r.txt<br /><br />All constructive criticism is welcome!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Hey, Vlad, goblin here. Any chance you can post that as an html file instead of pdf? I repeatedly hear that pdf files pose security risks, especially if accessing them via tor. Of course if this is an old wive&#039;s tale, let me know.

It is possible to get an onion site through Freedom Hosting, but you have to have what they&#039;re calling an invite code. Those are few and far between, you have to have a site for a month before you get one to give away or to sell to somebody. I have such a site, and will have a code in about two weeks; unfortunately I kinda sorta promised it to someone else. You can buy one at Black Market or sometimes on SR (rarely!).<br /><br />goblin
