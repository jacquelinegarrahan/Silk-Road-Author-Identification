				1. undercover LE gains trust and DPR accidentally or unintentionally reveals personal information.<br /><br />2. bitcoin transactions somehow traced back.&nbsp; DPR is most likely one of the single largest holders of bitcoin and because all transactions are in the public block chain it is imperative that they be highly obfuscated, especially when cashing out or transferring large amounts.&nbsp; i wouldn&#039;t be surprised if LE were not already flagging any bitcoin transfers above a certain size as suspicious.<br /><br />what else?<br /><br />

				&quot;how will they catch DPR? proactive discussion about how to keep SR alive&quot;<br /><br />Implying DPR will ever be caught.. Fine I&#039;ll play here are the most probable endings..<br /><br />1. Some guy claims to be DPR so they arrest him and sentence him to life in prison, thus keeping DPR safe.<br /><br />2. They need to make the public think they&#039;re good at catching people so they catch a person they call DPR and say they&#039;ve won the drug war, thus keeping DPR safe.

				When I first got here about 8 months ago DPR was a LOT less careful about person details. Fuck I know where the dude lives! - not to many people can get away with having Admin as there screen name (DPR&#039;s old username). Cause I sent him some shit. Hopefully he wasn&#039;t as stupid to many others.

				Just saying the guys name was Admin and he had all those bars showing who he was. Then he was also being and really cryptic about what he was saying.<br /><br />So ya. Anyways just saying what happened. Who knows maybe I&#039;m seeing things. I&#039;d never say shit to ANYONE and haven&#039;t this whole time but just saying. Who knows maybe it was bullshit.

				The most likely scenario is that at some point DPR didn&#039;t access the server securely and when the server is compromised they will be able to find him via the logs he has left behind. Also, LE probably bought some shrooms from SR back when he was vending so they likely already have a rough idea of his geographical position.

				Cops round us all up and lace some tea with 250mg of MDMA.<br /><br />We all confess everything - the cops stay on amphetamine so have no empathy and play us like kittens by sending in the nice looking young cop women to play &#039;angel&#039; and some fat cop with a face like sin to scream at us whilst Ms Angel empathizes with us and says she only wants to sleep with whoever owns the website.<br /><br />So we all confess - but the pillow talk would be a retraction.<br /><br />On the serious side - the main weakness here would be giving an address to LEA who set up a sting online. But unlike real life - cops could not set up a shop and actually sell gear. That is illegal. There is a possibility someone could pretend to set up shop and offer wares to admin. <br /><br />The reality is that cash strapped police departments cannot bring down pedophile websites. There are terrorist websites also - real guys and gals whose idea of &#039;fun&#039; is maybe to blow a few people up. <br /><br />How many times have we heard the politicians say they will stamp out heroin? Journalists pay their game in crying about morals and the law as if they adhere to either. <br /><br />There will be more LEA here buying a stash for the weekend of fun with the missus than there are cops on here as some actual unit to stamp this out once and for all. The more clever cops know that the onion directory has many more websites and more mushrooming. Closing down SR would see an explosion of onion and other websites as the journalists advertise.<br /><br />Every paper that runs an article on SR is advertising it for free. How many tabloid newspaper readers are a really anti drugs? So the ones reading about pure heroin (lol) are going to have a percentage who will have installed Tor and&nbsp; learn about bitcoins and joined SR before the midnight hour chimes&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />If I ran this website I would actually set up a few websites and then announce the closure of this and point people to maybe a dozen sites. Keep doing that every so often. Its nice to have Silk Road but the template of this website could actually be sold - or even hired&nbsp; ;) - that way the owner could set a time scale to bail out - and have bitcoins still rolling into dozens of separate accounts that keep bouncing the BTC around and eventually throwing out real life coins or notes or just paying the bills.<br /><br />Nothing lasts forever - this site is great but no way ought the owner risk possible massive repercussions. If he or she or they live in Holland its not too bad&nbsp; ;) but the UK we could see someone sent to the USA and they got crazy notions about drug dealing and harsh sentences. So it all depends on nationality. <br /><br />I would not want the owner to risk things just for the SR brand. that is expendable but your time and wellbeing is not. Maybe the owner has family also which would make me say get out whilst the going is good IF your nation happens to be the USA!!<br /><br />I&#039;ll run a pot only onion website for you! I&#039;ll be your BTC bitch - lol. <br /><br />If I was running this I would be be waiting for some American senators daughter to go stupid take 2 grams of E and for the senator to blame the E and not the stupidity of his now defunct daughter. She could have done it with a bottle of JD (Jack Daniels)<br /><br />Silk Road till the end of the year maybe?<br /><br />Advertise a few in advance.<br /><br />I wonder how much BTC someone would pay for this site?<br /><br />I got 3.87BTC - but I&#039;m not going to give out my BTC wallet addy - or offer sexual favours for say 2BTC? No. Not even 3BTC. I got morals. But send me an 8 ball of that fine Canadian vendors yayo and I will hug you long time!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />Wow you are stoned if you finished it all.<br /><br />As my friend said on E .... &#039;I fucking love you&#039;<br /><br />Silk Road might die one day but Silk Way or Silk Walk or Silk Passage or Silk whatever. You can see the spirit will live on.<br /><br />Closing SR - moving servers - setting up more BTC accounts - getting the software set up and finely tuned. Better to plan ahead and do in a set time frame what you might not be able to do if things happen fast and the cops come. That said SR might last another ten years. Only takes some major world event and everyone forgets about drugs. <br /><br />Lucky its not my problem. :)

				The scary thing is I hope DPR has a back up plan if something happens to him. Like if he chokes on some food or gets hit by a bus. He better have some underlings ready to take over. <br />Just like his character of DPR in the movie the princess bride, someone else comes up to wear the black mask, heh.

				Everyone seems to be missing the point. Of course they&#039;ll catch &quot;this&quot; DPR, but who knows which one he is. Just like in The Princess Bride DPR isn&#039;t a person it&#039;s a position, and when one is caught or retires another will take his place.

I think if DPR was smart enough to A. create this little lagoon of magical mystery, B. Keep it going for this long. C. Securely launder the proceeds from this place he is most likely smart enough to keep himself safe for the foreseeable future. I mean Christ on a bike given what I just said give the guy some credit. Anyone smart enough to get this far is smart enough to lock himself down tighter than a Nuns flaps. Only way he would jeopardize this cash-cow is if he got cocky and stupid which I can&#039;t see happening myself. <br /><br />These are just my thoughts on the subject anyway.

				DPR, if you read this thread, please read your PMs. I sent you one a couple weeks ago basically stating several points in this thread.<br /><br />Oh, and as soon as you can, move. If any of your clients from the way-back-when spill your general location to the feds, it can mean only bad news for you. You make a lot of money on this site, so put as much of it as you can toward your personal safety and security.
