				&nbsp;I&#039;ve pretty much figured out everything I need for the first transaction. These bit coins confuse the fuck out of me. What should I be using? I was thinking VirtEx but am not sure.

Anyone who can explain in layman&#039;s terms? <br /><br />&nbsp;And last but lot least. If what I want is 55cash (I have it set to show cash value) will I need extra?

				I haven&#039;t used any of the other BTC exchangers so I don&#039;t know if there are any that are instant, but you can get you BTC pretty quickly with VirtEx if you use the cash deposit method of funding your account. All but one of my deposits went though within an hour or so. From there you can buy your BTC and get them over to SR; Depending on how paranoid you are and method you use, this can take as little as ~1 hour (VirtEx=&gt;SR) or longer if send the BTC to a bunch of other places before SR. <br /><br />Not sure what you&#039;d like to know about offline wallets, there isn&#039;t much to it... go to bitcoin website, download program and install it. The program itself isn&#039;t hard to figure out, it&#039;s pretty straight forward.<br /><br />IMO it&#039;s better to deposit more than the price of the item you&#039;d like to purchase. There is a fee when buying the BTC, there may also be a fee when transferring from BTC exchanger to SR if you use a tumbler service (I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called). And someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I think the SR fees are part of the listed price, not entirely sure on this one. So I think it&#039;s better to have extra BTC left over instead of being short and having to go through the whole process for a couple dollars.

When I do the cash deposit should I do it in person at the bank? Do they ask questions and i.d and shit.... or should I just use the online banking?

				I find it easiest to just go to the bank and make the deposit in person, more anonymous and seems to be the quickest way to fund your account. Not the most convenient but I&#039;d rather take the extra precaution.<br /><br />Sometimes they ask for ID, you don&#039;t have to provide it unless your depositing &gt;$10,000 (I think, overheard another teller informing my teller while making a deposit). Just bring the cash and leave your wallet at home or in the car. If they ask, offer to go out to your car and get it; if they take you up on the offer just leave and try another branch. They will usually ask for your name though. You can just give them a fake one, just be sure to have one ready so your don&#039;t hesitate to think of one on the spot.

				I use Canadian Bitcoins when I&#039;m in a hurry.<br />https://www.canadianbitcoins.com/index.php<br /><br />Buy a pre-paid visa with cash, and western union them the money. If you send it before 4pm MCT<br />you&#039;ll have the bitcoins the same day.<br /><br />Virtex online bill pay works pretty good, but it&#039;ll take 2 days for your deposit to show up, your better off <br />doing a cash deposit if your in a hurry - but you&#039;ll have to find an RBC.

				Thank god for this thread and some fricken answers finally on how to cash out BTC as a Canadian.<br /><br />I use virtex, and at the moment they work fine, but I want to cash out anonomously, whether that be EMT or whatever virtex only lets you do a direct bank deposit or a &#039;hyperwallet&#039; deposit.<br /><br />If you&#039;re Canadian i&#039;m not sure how hard it would be to find an RBC bank.&nbsp; There are 20 within 5km of me apparently.&nbsp; That happens when there are only like 5 or 6 banks in a country, finding an RBC bank in Canada is simple, i&#039;ve liked virtex for this cuz when i do a deposit they approve it within 2-3 hours.<br /><br />For a Canadian vendor though i&#039;m not sure what are good options on sustainable anonymous BTC sales?&nbsp; or are there any.

				&nbsp;Thanks everyone. I&#039;m pretty close to multiple rbc&#039;s so that&#039;s no problem.

If you&#039;re just buying under $1,000 every 90 days then no problem. Yes, they are good &#039;as is&#039; you can just withdraw straight to your SR account if you don&#039;t care, otherwise use instawallet or your own bitcoin client as a more anonymous middle man to send coins to first.

				Yea i use CaVirtex by doing cash deposits. They asked me for i.d once cuz im a &quot;non-client&quot; ( i dont have a bank with them ) but i asked for a few deposit slips for Virtex and now every other time i deposit ( this time with a deposit slip ) they dont ask for i.d, they just take the deposit slip, do wut they gota do, and its quick and easy and anonymous. I guess i should have said that i forgot my id when i went for the first time, but it slipped my mind, o well, Ha.

Also, I&#039;ve not had coffee this morning so I&#039;m not going to bother to review it for how valid it is a response to your questions, but I wrote a post a while back on Bitcoins and security, so here it it:<br /><br />&quot;Bitcoins are online currency.<br /><br />To obtain bitcoins, you can exchange money for bitcoins in any number of places.<br />MtGox is a good place, plus there are dozens of people on SR. However, you must always be wary of scams and the like.<br />MtGox can be found at MtGox.com and help using it can be found here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=62789.0<br /><br />When you go to use bitcoins, you should be careful not to leave a trail.<br /><br />Use wallets. Buy bitcoins with the money of a friend if you can, or family preferably. Then transfer the bitcoins to one of these wallets. They&#039;re all over. Let me know and I can link you to a few trusted ones.<br /><br />That wallet will be disposable for buying bitcoins. Once you transfer the funds out, delete it.<br /><br />Then you transfer funds to another wallet. This can be your main one. Have a very strong password, and don&#039;t delete it.<br /><br />Once you&#039;re ready to buy, you can transfer from your main wallet to a temporary (delete it after) wallet for transactions. Then, however the protocol for buying on the site you&#039;re buying from works, you&#039;ll probably transfer funds to a wallet you keep with them. Use this only for money you&#039;re about to spend.<br /><br />Silkroad uses a wallet which you put bitcoins in and then spend out of. It&#039;s convenient. There are lots of guides on buying on SR so I&#039;m not going to go into it. A quick search will reveal all you need to know.<br /><br />That guide is a general overview, and it goes through my personal, medium-level paper-trail-reduction system. :P Use that when making illegal purchases.<br /><br />Bitcoins and SR themselves are not illegal, but depending on where you are might arouse some suspicion so if you have to let on that you&#039;re into bitcoins, at least cover the trail to SR or you&#039;ll have someone looking at you a bit closer.<br /><br />I hope this has helped. Feel free to PM me with any more questions you may have.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not 100% about how offline Bitcoins work, but this raises that question with me, so I&#039;m off to go do research on it!<br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />- The Consultant
