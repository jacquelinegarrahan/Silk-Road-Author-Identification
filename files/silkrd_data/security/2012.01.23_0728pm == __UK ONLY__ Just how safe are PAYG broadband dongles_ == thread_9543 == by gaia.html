				I&#039;m thinking ultra security here - which is a little crazy considering the small personal amounts involved - but it would make me feel better so out of interest, if I was to use PAYG broadband from various outdoor locations to access SR and place any orders, how secure would it be?<br /><br />There is always software associated when installing the sticks. So could this be cynically used when you&#039;re at home using IE or similar to access the Internet and transmit your IP address, when you&#039;re not using TOR without you knowing?<br /><br />

				IP addresses are transmitted to every website and server you use directly. Otherwise those websites and servers wouldn&#039;t know what part of the network you belong to!<br /><br />It&#039;s a digital &#039;I&#039;m here&#039; on the network.<br /><br />Now, if you mean some form of spyware mentioning to LEO that you visited SR and bought drugs? That is extremely unlikely because it implies Big Brother installed the same spyware on every single dongle. Bit of a reach.<br /><br />I think using a PAYG broadband dongle is a excellent idea however. I wouldn&#039;t be giving them any real information however. If you need to falsify documents, then do it. An IP address that leads to nowhere is a good thing IMHO.<br /><br />Protip: use a prepaid credit card to pay the bill.

				- performance is not consistent, certain times of day seems to become unworkable / pointless.<br />- anyone with the tools could track your location to within a few metres whilst you are online, so location plus any public security camera in the area<br />&nbsp; = not a situation I would want to be in.<br />- don&#039;t know what sort of resources are available to followup on Tor traffic ?! -my guess is very little.<br /><br />- its worth the risk if you need to connect routinely for up to say 15mins a session<br />&nbsp;(bear in mind your location can be recorded / measured each time...ie change of location or be evasive.)<br />&nbsp; working on a laptop on the move would be ideal as location changes and connect times.<br /><br />&nbsp;i have heard its so accurate (location) they can pinpoint a level in block of apartments and then summise which apartment you would be working from !<br /><br />security:<br />- can forget about any security changes like mac address etc as all your traffic is coming from the same isp dongle which is a fixed mobile No, deviceid.<br />- &quot;you&quot; have no idea what data the dongle is periodically sending to their servers whilst you browse using their software, use the dongle with Linux now thats<br />&nbsp; smarter as the Linux driver and software are most likely available in source code for everyone to see.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks guys. Some good observations.<br /><br />I was just curious really. I am probably like a lot of people here....I am not in my teens so have lost all my old drug contacts, I am fed up with the usual crap street deals I am left with, and I have a family that I don&#039;t want to endanger any more than necessary. I guess I should grow up and leave the drugs alone, but they&#039;ve been a part of my life for too long now that it&#039;s a part of who I am. Plus it&#039;s the only method of escape from chronic pain that I suffer. <br /><br />I guess anything that minimises the risk is worth exploring. As I said, it would only be for ordering, and I would only ever use the USB dongle and laptop when on the move, and never EVER at home. <br /><br />@pineappleexpress, what I was getting at is as a result of pure paranioa. But is that a bad thing? :) I was just scared that the software it installs may &#039;phone home&#039; when not on the move, so as to pass on any fixed IP address. This would then match up with the dongle&#039;s SIM that was detected when ordering off SR! The sensible side of my brain tells me this is highly unlikely, and the software would only be used when the USB is active. But I don&#039;t have the knowledge to assume this. <br /><br />The stick was 1GB preloaded, and purchased with cash by the way!<br /><br />I tried it out today, and it does work a treat with TOR stored on a separate dongle though :)

				...pinappleexpress is talking about the ipaddress you get when you connect, it is likely to change each time you connect but is the least of your problems since the<br />&nbsp; dongle deviceid + its sim/mobile No are fixed and are the identifying bits here.<br />

				- yes its a risk, plenty of those dongles will work under Linux say, but often its model specific ie a cheaper lower speed one might be difficult to get working.<br />&nbsp; their software could be snooping on your activities unless some hacker out there has spent the time proving it is ok i would by default not trust what vodafone / o2 are<br />&nbsp; doing.<br />&nbsp; there is an element that you can&#039;t cater for is if the subversive communication is on a lower level ie the dongle / chip level, well there&#039;s not much that you are<br />&nbsp; going to stop unless if perhaps a custom firmware avail on the inter-web somewhere removes that capability.<br /><br />nothing in IT is straight forward.<br />ultimately do what you can and accept the level of risk you cannot mitigate.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				You&#039;re right...in this cat and mouse game, all we can do is work with the knowledge and ability we have. And accept nothing is 100% safe. I suppose the best (though perhaps excessive) thing I could do to minimise my paranoia is to uninstall the software everytime I finish using the dongle.<br /><br />I guess I was half expecting many other people to be using mobile PAYG broadband though. On the face of it, it would seem to be putting more distance between myself and the snoopers. And that&#039;s got to be a good thing.<br /><br />In the end, I think I need to get perspective on this though....I&#039;m only a very small and uninteresting fish in a sea of entertainers. If they were to catch up with me, I would yield very little, and be a pathetic return for their investment.&nbsp; ;D

				Best bet is to buy one from one of those second hand phone shops that have sprung up in every city in the country, the ones that do the cheapo accessories and unlocking. Also buy a few sim cards (ideally get seven and use a different one each day to connect). Buy top-ups for cash or use an anonymous pre-paid card to pay the bill (does anybody have a link for any UK/EU ones with decent limits).

They won&#039;t let you enter the same address twice but you can change it a little each time to keep on receiving free cards e.g<br /><br />John Doe<br />12 Cherry Tree Lane<br />London<br />E12 6EJ<br /><br />Jonathan Doe<br />Twelve Cherry Tree Lane<br />London<br />E12 6EJ<br /><br />etc. etc.<br /><br />The SIMS won&#039;t be activated until you top up. You can do this by buying a code from a store with a PayPoint using cash. Either find a store which doesn&#039;t use CCTV or buy a code and wait for a few months before using it (check to make sure they won&#039;t expire!) As most shops wipe their video records after a fixed period of time.<br /><br />Needless to say you should switch to a new SIM as each one expires and never reuse one.<br /><br />As for the Dongle I would suggest you go on eBay to find a generic USB dongle - or indeed one where you can install the software yourself as this is quite easy to do. (I have a friend who can give you instructions on how to do this).<br /><br />As posters have already said here it would be a moot point in any case as although it might be possible to detect your connection is Torified it&#039;s a far cry from that to being able to read your specific browsing activities. For this reason I connect to SR and these forums from my home and work machine - all that LE can know is that you&#039;re using onion routing, not that you&#039;re connecting to SR - and of course every time you switch SIMS, they have to find you all over again.<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I don&#039;t do drugs but in the past have dealt with forged money / ID and my usual MO was to grow my beard out for a couple of days and put on some rumpled clothing (not a difficult look to pull off when you&#039;re a student!) then go to your local Church. <br /><br />Put it about that you&#039;re in between jobs and when some kindly old do gooder offers to help tell them you&#039;d appreciate somewhere you can pick up the mail for your job applications.<br /><br />If this sounds too much like hard work, get yourself some fake ID and have it sent to your local Post Office in a false name &quot;Poste Restante&quot; (http://www.postoffice.co.uk/letters-parcels/receiving-letters-parcels/redirection-options/poste-restante). Try to find some nice little rural PO and don&#039;t use the same one twice in a row! :-)<br /><br />I received two PAYG sims in the mail today from O2 although in fairness they did have my first name emblazoned on the front of the envelope. However as I said the most the filth could do is prove that you ordered a SIM card which was later used to access Tor which in itself is not a crime.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve just pinged an e-mail to my mother&#039;s friend who no doubt will enlighten us.<br /><br />In the mean time, I&#039;ve been reviewing UK law on this matter, a couple of useful links, firstly Crown Prosecution Service Guidelines on Possession of controlled substances as laid out in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971:<br /><br />http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/drug_offences/index.html#a26<br /><br />As you can see the burden of proof must be both that the accused has :<br /><br />- Actual physical possession <br />- Knowledge of an illegal substance.<br /><br />The CPS guidelines even cite a case R v Warner (1969) which established on appeal that a person cannot be in possession of something of which he is completely unaware. In this case Warner was pulled over by two Police Officers who found two packages, one of which contained scent and the other amphetamines. <br /><br />Warner tried to claim he believed both packages contained scent when he took possession of them. The Jury was less than convinced and convicted him after deliberating for less than twenty minutes. On appeal, the judgment was reaffirmed by Lord Pearce. (Source: http://bit.ly/IHLGUL)<br /><br />The above link is an extract from Crime Line - a periodical for criminal defence Solicitors and anyone interested in Criminal Law. The text is a bit involved, so I will just cite the relevant part here:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There is a defence under section 28 Misuse of Drugs Act 1968. If the defendant<br />can show that, they neither knew nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the<br />substance in question was a controlled drug.<br /><br />There is an evidential burden on the defendant to show that, they neither knew nor<br />suspected nor had reason to suspect that the substance in question was a controlled<br />drug. It is then for the prosecution to prove on all of the evidence the guilt of the<br />accused.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As you can see, if a defence were to be mounted on this basis, the burden of proof would be on the Defendant to show that if drugs were sent to their house, they had no knowledge of its contents. <br /><br />Lord Pearce however says that since it is possession of a drug that is illegal, this would not be automatic grounds for acquittal:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Act forbids possession of these drugs.<br />Whether he possesses them with an innocent or guilty mind or for a laudable or<br />improper purpose is immaterial since he is not allowed to possess them. If he<br />possessed them he is guilty. If a man has physical control or possession of a thing that<br />is sufficient possession under the Act provided that he knows that he has the thing.<br />But you do not (within the meaning of the Act) possess things of whose existence you<br />are unaware. The prosecution have here proved that he possessed the parcel, but have<br />they proved that he possessed its contents also? There is a very strong inference of fact<br />in any normal case that a man who possesses a parcel also possesses its contents, an<br />inference on which a jury would in a normal case be justified in finding possession. A<br />man who accepts possession of a parcel normally accepts possession of the contents.<br /><br />But that inference can be disproved or shaken by evidence that, although a man was<br />in possession of a parcel, he was completely mistaken as to its contents and would<br /><br />not have accepted possession had he known what kind of thing the contents were. A<br />mistake as to the qualities of the contents, however, does not negative possession.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On the bright side the Police/Customs would have to be aware of the contents of the package too in order for them to be able to attempt to prosecute. The Act also states you must be in actual physical possession of the goods therefore you&#039;d have to accept the package into your home or collect them from the post office depot yourself in order for them to prove both both possession and control.<br /><br />Naturally under law using the address of a third party would also not be a basis for a defence if you&#039;re caught but this is much less likely to happen in the first place if you don&#039;t use your own address.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />

Even if LEO were monitoring your connection all they would be able to see was that you&#039;re using Tor. <br /><br />There&#039;s no reliable way for them to prove you visited the SR in particular.<br /><br />One of the best and most plausible ways to rebut any suspicion is to operate a Tor relay from your own home to make your own Tor traffic indistinguishable from others - this also expands and speeds up the Tor network. You&#039;ll find this as an option under Vidalia - obviously don&#039;t try and do this on a 3G connection or you&#039;ll get a mammoth bill! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
