				http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/Homes+evacuated+police+bust+suspected+drug/7136987/story.html<br /><br />Yellow powder (DMT), plant material (Mimosa hostilis root bark), chemicals... Went down on the 23rd, Trojan hasn&#039;t been online since then. Is it him?<br /><br />What are our concerns as buyers? Can the feds decode our names and addresses with his PGP key? I assume any packages ready-to-be-sent will have visible addresses on them. What does having an address mean to the cops? They can&#039;t prove we solicited drugs without a cash paper trail (of which there is none). And if we never received a package there&#039;s no point in tracking us down for one, right?<br /><br />I&#039;m just a bit paranoid and I&#039;d like to know what usually happens after a vendor bust.

				they won&#039;t stop the war on drugs, not until everyone submits to them.&nbsp; they hate freedom and independent expression especially when it hits their sacred &quot;War on Drugs&quot; despite they break the Geneva Conventions in their prosecution of &quot;The War on Drugs&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />This war has brought out many divers colors of character to chart this unknown, many will fall, but the winner all the spoils will live like a God for a time...................

				although the article looks horrible and a good possibility it might be him, 5 days ago his announcement said he was going to be taking down his listing. <br /><br />&quot;August 20 2012*************************************************************************<br />I have been getting flooded with orders and I have been having difficulty keeping up. For the first time in months I am going to have to de-list most of my items in order to catch up with the growing backlog of orders. They will likely be down for about a week. Once I make my way through my backlog of orders and I am flush with readily available product I will relist these listings. Some items; such as the Pharma&#039;s will stay up for now. If you are waiting for your order to be processed or shipped please be patient. If you are waiting to make an order; the listings will be back up soon enough. Thank you everybody for your patience:) Much love.&quot;<br /><br />so as i had ordered i will be cleaning house tomorrow to be safe, i will wait and see if my order already in transit arrives and lay low until i move in a few weeks. its a wake up call to not be complaisant. I would consider my security to be above what most people have here but still not what it should be. ill be upping my security in my time off and hope everyone else does the same.<br /><br />best of luck to everyone and hope all is well.<br /><br />

				Still have some hopes for the best no matter how deep down they&#039;re buried... but the lack of communication/downed listings/revealed location to be calgary seems to seal the deal

				If any of you are affected by this or are worried this guy may have had your info follow standard procedure. <br /><br />1. Clean System<br /><br />2. Clean House<br /><br />3. Look through the local business directories for a decent lawyer just in case. <br /><br />4. Don&#039;t order anything else or do any illegal shit for a while. <br /><br />5. If the pig come knocking, SHUT THE FUCK UP. <br /><br />God speed to all.

				Thanks Limetless...<br />So i made a new account for this post, i had a rather large international (not US) order with trojan with a some what &quot;burn&quot; address. I placed it without a pgp but it was never stated as shipped and have since canceled the order..
