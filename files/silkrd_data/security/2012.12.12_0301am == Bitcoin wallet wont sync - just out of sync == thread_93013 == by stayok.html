				If you&#039;re way out of sync it could take a very long time. Just leave it open and forget about it for another couple days.

				But it isnt a way to get better connection? I had a teory that maybe since i use VPN it have to do a much bigger number/algorythm, but when i thought more about it, it shouldnt count.. But where are their server? In arctic or something? My vpn is on a 1000mbit fiber optic cable 100m from where it cross the ocean to the us.. So what the **** ;)

				The first time I tried the bitcoin software two years ago - it took a few hours to sync. Now it takes four or five days running on a slow computer (2.8ghz P4) . I don&#039;t think your connection speed is the bottleneck , its more CPU and DISC speed. At this rate in a year its going to take weeks. But I think the bitcoin developers are working on some way of pruning the database, so this problem does not get out of hand.

				Bitcoin-QT can get stuck if your block chain data files are corrupted. You can try to delete them and start over.<br /><br />Data corruption can happen if your client doesn&#039;t shut down properly.

				I had the same problem and gave up.<br />Try alternate clients, Electrum and Multibit for example, I like both of them and they don&#039;t need to download the whole blockchain.
