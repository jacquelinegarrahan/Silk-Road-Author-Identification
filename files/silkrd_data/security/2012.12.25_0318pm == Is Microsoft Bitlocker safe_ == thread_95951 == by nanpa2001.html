				Is Microsoft Bitlocker safe? I am using it to encrypt my USB drive because it is more manageable than truecrypt. <br /><br />That being said if there is any kind of backdoor that authorities can use to get into it, then it is worse than useless.<br /><br />So is Bitlocker safe or not?

				Definitely NOT SAFE. Is not suitable for the level of security you desire. Truecrypt is not hard to use at all. You can run it in Portable Mode, Encrypt the entire drive or Encrypt a non-system partition/drive with a Hidden Volume created within.

				Would you really trust your security in the hands of a Microsoft product?&nbsp; &nbsp;As Wadozo stated, put your energy into learning TC.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />Luv<br />PG

				Iv just started to dabble with TC a few weeks ago and so far all iv mounted in my USB stick, and im really not sure if i did that correct. It says it mounted and shows the name on the TC program when i pull it up, So how does that work&gt; ? If somone was to pullout the USB stick with my stuff on it they would need a password to access it?

Was it the entire USB drive or just a partition containing a Hidden Volume (which is where you want to keep the most important files/info.) This option will create a password to access the encrypted partition and there will be a second password required to access the Hidden Volume. It&#039;s important to read through the manual from the Truecrypt website which details step by step, just how things are done.

				I followed the instructions and i remeber setting up a file with a name to it, then chose to send it to my usb stick, then it went on and i chose to encrypt the usb, so when it asked what i wanted to mount i had to go to my usb find the file i named and mount it.. I chose to put it on X which it then made anotheer i guess container on the my computer cause it shows X now with no files in it, but it wont allow me to send anything to it either.I just didnt fully understand when i was setting it up, I may uninstall it and do it again from scratch and read it all over again.. I was also gonna do the outer and Inner option where u have a inner system working on a outer system like u spoke of, but when i went to do it i didnt have a blank disc to use.. The name of the file i created is on my USB but when i open it its nothing on it but programs of normal stuff, so im just not sure if its been done correct. I dont feel it has so it proley has not... wHATS another Good way to Encrypt a USB stick?

				Try Liberte / Tails if you don&#039;t want to use TC. Sounds like you need to format the USB stick again and start from scratch.&nbsp; :)

				Security experts will tell you that no proprietary software is safe. Corporations can collude with the government to introduce backdoors, and Microsoft is known to have a cozy relationship with law enforcement. They provide software like COFEE<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Online_Forensic_Evidence_Extractor<br /><br />Open source software is safer because it can be reviewed by independent experts. TrueCrypt is open source. GPG is open source. BitLocker is not open source, and some of the Windows ports of GPG may not be open source, so be careful, and choose open source security solutions over proprietary ones.
