				so, not been Silk Road for a while. Tried recently, but think it was under attack.,<br /><br />Anyway, reason I not been was a big problem with INTERSANGO bitcoin exchange - they basically stole my money and took months to sort and I lost lots of value.<br /><br />Anyway - bitcoins - WTF with the price!<br /><br />And what happened to instawallet? Anyone got an alternative?<br /><br />Also, need to know somewhere good to get bitcoins (I am in UK) that isn&#039;t intersango - advice welcomed.<br /><br />And I forgot a lot - is there a stick/link to an up to date guide?
