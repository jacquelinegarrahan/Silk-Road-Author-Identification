				ok so to me.. its a no brainer <br />send to a p.o. box.. that way they dont raid ur house they just take ur package.. thats <br />at least what i would assume would happen either way im denying everything to the grave<br />i would never tell on myself and say yeah u got me i ordered that <br />i would say shit.. idk man.. that aint even my name on that package.. shit idk who that is<br />and idk whats in that.. im bout to send it back right noooww..<br /><br />but some might say they will raid ur house on the i.d. that u signed up for the po box with.. <br />highly doubtful they have no probable cause to say that i have drugs there.. only in the p.o. box...<br /><br />let me know what yall think..<br /><br />i believe that home address is out of the question.. unless u have nothing to hide inside your house. <br />but if ur on this site i would assume that u might have... idk at least some kind drugs or something like that.. <br /><br />what do u guys do? how do u feel about it ? let me know im here with open mind and ears :-X<br />

				Just cause you have it sent to a PO BOX address doesn&#039;t mean that when they catch your &#039;felony&#039; amount of drugs they won&#039;t nail you.&nbsp; It depends on the quantity and what you ordered.&nbsp; As usual, the rule is s say nothing, you don&#039;t even have to deny just say nothing.&nbsp; Saying nothing is better than denying.

				the problem is ecause it happend to swim is that if its international and gets caught they wont let it thru but.swim had domestic delivery they let him take it out of the post office then grabbed him. rememer possesion 9/10 of the law you might get away with sayin i had no idea what was in it. or they will watch you take it home and hit you there point is p.o. boxes arent foolproof . my suggestions would be couple things .find out previous occupants name and slightly change itif was john smith use close variation not excact bc my get sent to his new address or use very close variation of neigbhor or find empty house for sale near you send it there in there name watch for it if get caught say they asked you to watch house i know these arent most rilliant ideas but they do put a lil more space between you for plausible deniaility

				ok plausible denieability <br /><br />i have a p.o. box.. <br />someone sent there package to wrong po box.. cuz that aint my name on box<br />that seem plausible to me.. <br />shit just dont open it for a day or two.. <br />or .. take it to a gym or sum shit and open it in the locker room<br /><br />if u let a cop follow u home ur just dumb and shouldnt be here..<br />i would know off the bat if someone is following me home<br /><br />ur plan sounds perfect.. perfect for normal people.. <br /><br />but i have shit at my house i would never want to risk getting raided <br />otherwise yeah i would go with ur plan.. <br /><br />so ur saying this happend to u cuz if not ..<br /><br />tits or gtfo<br /><br />

What about the situation where a person has a meth lab at their house. In that case, i&#039;d think you&#039;d be safer ordering to the P.O. Box.&nbsp; If you open the P.O. Box under your real info, you&#039;d still get plausable deniability right? <br /><br />If you get busted at your P.O. box, would that give just cause to search the main place of residence?

				i think they might TRY to get a warrent for your address listed on the id u opened the po box with <br />but i dont think a judge would sign it .. there is not probable cause that there is drugs there only in the package...<br />idk<br />im not worried about that becasue i have my id in a address i dont live in anymore so fuck it <br /><br />but i wouldnt risk it if u have a meth lab at ur house i would not link anything to it

				Someone mentioned elsewhere that a controlled drop would be harder for LE to do at a PO Box, but I&#039;m pretty sure most PO Boxes have security cameras trained on them 24/7 so they could always ID &amp; try to find you that way - but it&#039;d still make everything harder.

				Deliveries are made to PO Boxes as long as the address is there, name doesn&#039;t matter unless shit gets weird.&nbsp; How do you think all that @#%$ junk mail addressed to &#039;resident&#039; and such gets through?&nbsp; Every PO Box I&#039;ve ever had gets shitloads of random mail addressed to past users of that box.
