				Bitinstant to Coinapult was a very effective way (and the only way a lot of people including myself knew how) to get BTC, and now it seems as sketchy as humanly possible. <br /><br />If you use Bitinstant to get bitcoins to email or directly to your bitcoin address, they now require that you give them your full name and date of birth, in compliance with new regulations from the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), who&#039;s purpose is to enforce sanctions and certain economic trade restrictions (like buying bitcoins) on known, and alleged, terrorists and narcotics traffickers. They check the names against a blacklist, but I get the sense that the names can also contribute to the blacklist.<br /><br />Does anyone know what is going on here? <br /><br />I imagine if you are using it a lot you will get put on a list somewhere, and putting a false name would be fraud or something you just really don&#039;t want to go to prison for. My most realistic concern is the security risk of a search warrant being served on a person, previously unsuspicious, after they buy several thousand dollars worth of bitcoins over time, on the assumption that they are going to SR and there will be drugs in the house. <br /><br />So is my paranoia justified? Am I an idiot? What is the next move here, considering all of this?

				I just saw this on bitinstant&#039;s site. I&#039;m guessing it will be used to track large transfers of money. It could be a problem but I say you should change up your bitcoin funding options every so often.

				It seems like this OFAC law is mainly used to monitor individuals transferring money from certain &quot;terrorist&quot;-related countries.<br /><br />If you&#039;re paying in cash somewhere that doesn&#039;t require ID - couldn&#039;t you just enter someone else&#039;s name and birthday, and have it check out clean?&nbsp;

				Everything&#039;s working fine for me. (just a measly buyer). Though I did begin to question this in the days leading up to the CRASH of the system. <br /><br />I had been defending Bitinstant when people were upset about the &quot;Bitcoin to email&quot; feature being disabled.&nbsp; Some comments about having to show ID,&nbsp; and how they preferred Bank of America over CVS drugstore or Walmart and 7-11. - My rationale was, BoA definitely is monitoring you more than some flunkie at a 7-11 or CVS drugstore. <br /><br />I figured, if anyone wanted to follow you, they&#039;d go to the one actual bank, with top security cameras, who probably could get your plate, if not the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) off the sticker on your windshield. - No I was shot down as &quot;trusting&quot; a drugstore or &quot;quickie-mart&quot;.&nbsp; I guess old people really are wiser. <br /><br />Banksters are the our biggest enemy! Do you know how much they hate BITCOIN????- These are the ones behind the phony election of Obama (both times) and BUSH (both times). <br /><br />Obama speaks of &quot;the rich must pay their fair share&quot; - then bails out those on Wall St that contributed to his campaign. <br /><br />People like Warren Buffet. Richest old white man in America, yet supports Obama, supports taxing the rich, WHY? - because he&#039;s got Obama on salary. Keystone Pipeline (would have lowered gas/petro prices by over 1$ at least) - <br /><br />Oh and did I mention? Warren Buffet owns BoA???<br /><br />Buffet owns the trains that carry the coal that fuel the polluting plants that supply our electricity. - Yet Obama was able to play it like an &quot;environmental&quot; issue. - Oil bad- you know, for those fantasy tree hugging stoned out of their logical minds liberals..<br /><br />So what do I think happened with Bitinstant???<br /><br />Well I researched them before I bought my first bitcoin. - They were very adamant about &quot;Making sure no money laundering&quot; was taking place. They are centered right in the Financial District of NYC, as was plainly shown on Google Maps. - They were being so co-operative with the federalies that the federalies clamped down on them, or their lawyers saw a potention shit storm, if the govt ever does go after the SR crowd. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s as simple as, BitInstant was too good to be true. They were young entrepreneurs, making an innocent mistake, by trying to &quot;buck the system&quot; a little to make a buck. Those who were born and raised on &quot;bucking the system&quot; and turning the system to their advantage, are in power now. The smallest way of making a small or even a slight fortune, are being stamped out, by these mind controlling, Chicago gangstas like Obama and Co. - I&#039;m sure it&#039;s an Illuminati thing, that has the Bush&#039;s Romney&#039;s Clintons and Obama&#039;s- all with blood on their hands. As we&#039;re distracted from Obama&#039;s embracing of Islamofascists - The Muslim Brotherhood. Putting them in place, in the form of a phony uprising dubbed &quot; Arab Spring&quot; - What a nice sounding advert! &quot;Aw, the Arab Spring&quot; &quot;See? Obama cares about these angry Arabs&quot; -&nbsp; Now they wont be mad at us anymore!~ <br /><br />Wake up call!! - They still want to slice your throat, if you&#039;re - American/European White or Not White, Christian, Jew, or Atheist, - they still want to slice your throat. The overly medicated populus elects a man with &quot;HUSSEIN&quot; for a middle name. <br /><br />Oh forget it. - I&#039;m sure I stirred up some liberal stoners now. - Go ahead, attack me. <br /><br />Bottom line is, say goodbye to bitinstant, and standby, because there are many many other ways to buy btc, that you wont have to leave your home for, but if you only have cash, will be readily available. <br /><br />Patience! - Ignore politics. - Stop watching TV/cable/Sat news. - Just live your life, get as high as you want (responsibly) as long as you&#039;re not hurting anyone else, you&#039;re OK with me. <br /><br />Abuse this last gift of freedom, and you&#039;ll all suffer greatly. <br /><br />&quot;Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death&quot; - American Patriot.&nbsp; Can you name him???? - I&#039;m sure the commie lib teachers in US public schools don&#039;t teach about such things. <br /><br />AH well, ignore me. <br /><br />I&#039;m just an old white American, who watched a beautiful country slip away with each year. <br /><br />Am I angry??- You bet. - Am I dangerous? - It depends on whose side you&#039;re on.&nbsp;

				You don&#039;t need a fake ID... I did Bitinstant cash deposit at CVS -&gt; Email very recently. I used a BS DOB that I couldn&#039;t remember to save my life, a name that I&#039;d hate to actually have (was still a legit name), and a fake phone number on the Bitinstant site.&nbsp; When MoneyGram asked for my number I told them I didn&#039;t have a phone.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t miss a beat and kept on going with the process.&nbsp; I never had to try and recall the DOB that I used after the initial input on Bitinstant. After half a dozen or so transactions at various different CVS pharmacies, I have never, ever been asked for my ID.&nbsp; If I was I&#039;d tell them I didn&#039;t have one and I really need to pay that bill!<br /><br />One tip though: Have a fake (but real) address already in your mind when you call MoneyGram.&nbsp; I kinda stumbled through that part the first time and the woman started to act a little suspicious.

				Another successful Bitinstant - Moneygram client here. I did a few transactions earlier today and had the coins in less than an hour each time.<br /><br />Just use fake info like everyone says. You don&#039;t need to memorize anything other than the name/address you give Moneygram via the red phone. Seriously, it&#039;s that easy. You walk in, pick up the phone, follow simple instructions, tell them the amount, say your designated fake name/address plus a fake phone number you don&#039;t even need to remember, and that&#039;s it! Finally, go over to the cashier, tell them the name, pay the total, and sign the receipt. Done.<br /><br />Be prepared to be asked for ID at some locations. Calmly tell them your wallet is lost and that&#039;s why you are paying bills with cash in the first place, and they&#039;ll pretty much be forced to continue.<br /><br />It&#039;s not quite as easy as bank deposits, but there are advantages to this process. For one, drug stores are open later and they don&#039;t store their surveillance footage as long as banks, not to mention the shitty cameras and choppy DVR settings they use.

				Just used the Moneygram - Bitcoin Address option. Used a BS name, birthday, address, and phone number. BTC in my wallet within half an hour. <br /><br />My question though, is why be so anonymous and fake if it&#039;s perfectly legal to purchase BTC?

				Yeah, I don&#039;t like none of the ways...everything to do with them has gotten &#039;problematic&#039; for me...like I get money into dwolla, and then mtgox won&#039;t take them without &#039;verification&#039; (picture id uploaded) so try bitinstant...ends up same thing...only on *dwolla* side, this time...fuck, seems like ever few weeks have to learn new tricks for these people...I&quot;m now where I&quot;m willing to pay the xtra to use somebody on here, as long as they&#039;ve proven themselves trustworthy...just sick of the hassle with these outside people...but anway, captainMal came through for me, so I&quot;m good...

				What bullshit, lol DOB just to buy some bitcoins. Stop using these corporate entities, buy off #bitcoin-otc in privacy or p2p off the forums in the currency exchange forum base, or even better with cash using localbitcoins.com<br /><br />
