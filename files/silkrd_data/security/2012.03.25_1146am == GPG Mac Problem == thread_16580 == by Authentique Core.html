				Title: <strong>GPG Mac Problem</strong><br />

				Greetings here on the board. I&#039;ve got a really simple yet baffling problem that maybe someone can shed light on. I&#039;ve had a long night, so forgive the simplicity from which I&#039;ll speak about technical matters. In other words, this is my best, non-technical description of a problem I do not have the time to thoroughly investigate, at the moment.<br /><br />I am using Mac GPG tools. Now, I used to try my GPG Key, where I could easily encrypt a message. Thanks to a forum response, I finally figured out in order to &quot;lock&quot; and &quot;unlock&quot; my secret messages, I simply had to switch on these Services in the System Preferences, under &quot;Keyboard&quot;. Having done that, I got the hang of Encrypting my messages easily enough.<br /><br />Now there&#039;s been some time since I practiced this... I went to go encrypt my first msg on Silk Road, and now I see that there is nothing under services to choose &quot;Encrypt&quot;. When trying to switch this back &quot;ON&quot; in the system preferences, Keyboard&gt;&gt;Services&gt;&gt; there is no option of checkboxes to enable GPG options like Encrypt, etc... Taking advice here, I went to GPG Preferences and tried to press &quot;FIX&quot;. You can see I am relatively primitive in my technical wanderings, tonight. But again, there is no option to get those Services enabled. &quot;Fix GPG&quot; didn&#039;t work.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious if anyone here has an inkling whats going on here? How did that disappear, and how do I switch on that ability to bring back those Services in the drop down menu, or when for instance, I right-click on a text? How do I get GPG commands back in Services?<br /><br />Thanx to those who are patient reading this, I had a long night and my brain is not at its most communicative, nor thorough.<br /><br />&quot;AC&quot;

				I believe there is a bug where GPGTools creates 2 sets of Services. I think one does nothing and the other needs to be enabled manually. They should be called &quot;OpenPGP:&quot; Encrypt, Decrypt, etc.<br /><br />Another heads up, and maybe this is just a problem on my Mac, but GPGTools doesn&#039;t seem to work properly in the Aurora browser (which is what Tor comes with). If you try encrypt something, you might find your list of public/private keys empty. So I have to write things in TextEdit, encrypt, copy, paste. Annoying.
