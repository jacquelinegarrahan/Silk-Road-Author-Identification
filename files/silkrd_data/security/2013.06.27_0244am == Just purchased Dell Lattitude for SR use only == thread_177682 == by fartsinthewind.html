				If you run whonix you will seriously struggle with 1GB<br />If you want to run qubes your machine will melt and/or ossify on the spot<br />that only really leaves liberte, unless the OP is planning on using an insecure (or nominally insecure but then secured OS like debian), which would be kind of pointless as the machine was bought solely for SR use.

It sort of defeats the purpose of running something like TAILS in a VM when your host OS could have malware taking screenshots and reading your keyboard. I run TAILS off the wire.<br /><br />I think TAILS even warns you when it detects it is running as a VM.

The tails specs list 1GB RAM as the minimum for smooth running. When I first started I used a live USB it was on an old machine which had 1GB and it struggled. The 2GB machine I used next fared better but Ive never had a zippy tails.

				I just checked Tails 0.19 in VirtualBox. It uses 320 MB of RAM after TorBrowser has started. Then I started Pidgin, Claws Mail, GIMP, Scribus and Gobby and it was using 376 MB. Granted, I didn&#039;t do anything with these apps. I&#039;m sure the RAM increases over time, so yeah to run many applications for a long time, you&#039;ll want more than 512 MB, but I think if you only use TorBrowser, 512 should be fine.<br />

Just search the forums there are plenty of guides on how to do it, if thats not simple enough for you, Just search for tails on startpage, go to their main site, cick install And it gives you instructions anyway. <br />It seems fairly difficult the first time, But you will never forget after that.<br /><br />:)

				i&#039;d prefer buying a smaller laptop, like one of those acer netbooks (10 or 11.6 inches). they&#039;re newer, relatively cheap, and not so cumbersome.

				Just to chime in...<br />When first investigating TAILS, I ran it on an old 800Mhz DeskTop with 512MiB RAM. Sure, not very zippy, but it easily ran as well as WinXP on the same machine. Irregardless, whatever hardware you&#039;re using, TAILS is the way to go!<br /><br />...I gotta get me one of those NetBooks.
