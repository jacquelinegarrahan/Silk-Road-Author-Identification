				I understand the advantages to using open source software in any situation. When it comes to remaining anonymous, how important is it to use Linux as opposed to licensed Windows or OSX? Do Linux users yield a higher success rate? How safe would I be if I skipped the Liberte installation, and all the problems that come with it?

				I use windows and linux:<br /><br />My base OS is Ubuntu with full disk encryption and i run windows 7 in a virtual machine (windows itself is encrypted with bitlocker) the vm can&#039;t be booted without a special usb key that i keep in a secret place. Maybe this is overkill but i&#039;m a security maniac..&nbsp; ;D

If you wanted a more secure OS then there are plenty of other options, I would recommend FreeBSD. As much as I despise Macs and Apple in general, I will say that OSX is more secure than mainstream Linux distros, but time will tell if OSX will still be as secure in the future as it&#039;s replacing much of it&#039;s BSD roots with every release.

Linux is simply a better operating system. Instead of Liberte, I would use Tails, as it doesn&#039;t leave any traces on the machine it&#039;s run on.
