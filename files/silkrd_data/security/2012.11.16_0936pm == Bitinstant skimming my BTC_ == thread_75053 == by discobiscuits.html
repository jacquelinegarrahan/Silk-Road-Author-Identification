				So just did a Walmart to BTC address, thru moneygram/zip zap, and even though I made sure everything was correct amount/info wise I received about 7 usd less than I should have according to bitinstant&#039;s website, and the blockchain after 6 confirmations shows an amount less than what I should have received according to bitinstant. What is the deal? I have never had an issue before.&nbsp;

				bitinstant doesn&#039;t include zip zap&#039;s fee.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I transfer $300 from moneygram to btc address, I pay about 7 to 7.5% over the mtGox spot rate.

				the conversion rate of bitcoin to USD changes, which is why you would have a bit more left over after your order.

				Blockchain was used, and was supposed to receive about 42 but ended out with 39 somehow.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anonymizer was another 1.5% but I am almost positive I read an initial 42 entry in Blockchain, and assumed the 39 was the fee but doing the math doesn&#039;t pan out :\&nbsp; I can&#039;t exactly make a scene, so I&#039;ll just eat it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess nothing necessary or good in life comes easily.&nbsp; I guess who cares where they moved the cheese?&nbsp; Just get it.&nbsp; Too bad I&#039;m not a mouse.
