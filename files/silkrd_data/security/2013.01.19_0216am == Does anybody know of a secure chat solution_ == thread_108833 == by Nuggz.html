				I hear a lot of negative things about the security of the pidgin code base. However, I like it and with OTR + Tor it is quite nice. I notice that IRSSI with OTR and Tor is a more popular choice with the the l33t haxx0r and cypherpunk crowds, however I have never been a big fan of the more traditional IRC clients simply from a usability point of view. Pidgin has a much less steep learning curve than other IRC clients imo, although it has been several years since I tried anything else and Pidgin was the first program I used for IRC so if you are old school in regards to IRC you may have better luck with less noob friendly and probably more securely coded alternatives.

				I used to recommend NOT using Pidgin because it had glaring security issues, but a Tor developer named Jacob Appelbaum (ioerror) has done a lot of work to make it more secure.<br /><br />https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15286<br /><br />https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15290<br /><br />He doesn&#039;t criticize it as vocally as he used to.<br /><br />https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/239093399045672961<br /><br />https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/7539468040<br /><br />Most of the bugs he references have been fixed, so I would give a tentative thumbs up to Pidgin at this point.

				Applebaum still doesn&#039;t seem super thrilled. You link had this quote from him:<br /><br />&quot;Sad discovery of the day: Pidgin leaks DNS when you use a SOCKS5 proxy and jabber accounts&quot; <br /><br />Do you have a recommendation on which service to use with Pidgin?

				Sorry, I wasn&#039;t clear. Those were examples of when he was critical of Pidgin, like 6 months ago. If you follow the link in that tweet to the bug report:<br /><br />https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/11110<br /><br />That one was fixed too. I think overall Pidgin is much safer than it was even a year ago, mostly thanks to his good work.<br /><br />Edit: Actually that particular bug was fixed almost 2 years ago.

That said I still doubt he is very fond of Pidgin, none of the ultra l33t hackers seem to be. But it has been steadily improving. Conservatively speaking I guess I would suggest against it, or at least suggest isolating it (I do), but as far as user friendliness goes it really isn&#039;t beat by any other IM/chat program IMO. I use too many chat protocols to want to bother with anything else (pidgin supports everything I use), and I don&#039;t want to fuck around with doing IRC from a command line like the big boys do (even though I probably should).
