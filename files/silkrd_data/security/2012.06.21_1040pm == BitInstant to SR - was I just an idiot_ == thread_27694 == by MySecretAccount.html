				So after learning that all BTC vendors just use BI, I went straight to them and made a deposit, using my BTC address (from my SR account) as the deposit destination. It&#039;s been about 45-60 minutes since I got a confirmation email (I did the order using Tor...don&#039;t know if that&#039;s bad). <br /><br />Was I just an idiot, and did I fuck up by not using a masking service, and then having it transfer to SR?

				Call bitinstant and you will get a live operator. They are a legitimate business. I have had several high dollar transactions go through with bitinstant. My transactions were instant and flawless.

				As a one off? You&#039;re not going to Guantanamo Bay, I can guarantee that. SR uses a coin mixing service before transferred sums reach your account, all you&#039;ve done is make what should be a very awkward task for LE into a slightly less awkward task. Still pretty damn awkward though.<br /><br />The more I think about it, the more I think there&#039;s very little point trying to prosecute anyone who&#039;s simply buying from Silk Road. There is no usable evidence for LE as long as you&#039;ve followed the standard doctrines which I think we all know pretty well by now. Not mixing the coins isn&#039;t what will get you charged with a drugs offense, all you have to do is not talk to whoever arrests you. They likely won&#039;t even attempt an arrest, all believable stories about LE contacting SR users from this forum have not involved arrests, always an invitation to attend a police interview. Either decline to attend, or keep your mouth shut when you do, it&#039;s that easy (watch out for the pressure they will put you under with cleverly constructed sequences of questions, but if you&#039;ve been in a police interview before, you&#039;ll know what to expect)

				I didn&#039;t even do anything but fund an my BTC address using BitInstant&#039;s bank deposit method. It&#039;s confirmed as done, but I don&#039;t see it in my account. <br /><br />Does it just take a few hours, or am I fucked here? I haven&#039;t done anything illegal, unless funding BTC is illegal. <br /><br />I&#039;m just confused - I thought it was supposed to be instant, or close to it, and I see nothing transferred. Is that because of SR&#039;s built in tumbler or what have you?

				Bitinstant sends payment every hour. Once they send the payment, it will take a little while for the coins to actually arrive in your account, up to a few hours but usually around 1-2. I&#039;ve never deposited directly into silkroad though, I use the bitcoin to email option.

The transaction is complete when plugged in to the BI home page, I&#039;m wondering how long I give it, and/or how risky it is, to call and see what&#039;s wrong (if another 1-2 hours go by). <br /><br />I made the deposit over 2 hours ago, with the confirm made about 2 minutes later.

				Before you bend over, consider if bitinstant pays any transaction fees for the payments they send out. If they do not, processing of the transactions may take a lot longer then what you are used to. Also, it takes some time for SR to reflect bitcoins added to your balance. I&#039;ve noticed that when my client already marked the transaction as confirmed by several parties, it can still take a few hours before my balance at SR is updated.

				My first ever Bitcoin purchase from BitInstant to email came through within 30 minutes of making payment.<br /><br />But the transfer of BTC from my email to SR wallet took little more than an hour and half. First I was bit concerned. But the notes below the SR BTC address says to be patient.<br /><br />It looks like BitInstant/TrustCash fee and the USD to BTC exchange rate conversion took a big chunk of my money. I paid $301.CC at the counter and finally got only $280.CC in my SR wallet. I guess that&#039;s the cost of anonymity!!!<br />

				Let&#039;s close this thread, as I spread wide and within 20 minutes had my entire transfer. BI is super fucking legit. <br /><br />
