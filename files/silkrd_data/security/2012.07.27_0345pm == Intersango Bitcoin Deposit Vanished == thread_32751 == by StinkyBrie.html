				About 4 days ago I sent several hundred dollars worth of BTC to my Intersango account and the funds still haven&#039;t shown up. I double-checked the address but when I logged back in the next day it had changed to something different, as I&#039;ve noticed my bitcoin address cycle every now and again. I&#039;ve emailed their support department and they seem to have a record of the deposit but have basically been running me in circles, sending monosyllabic responses and otherwise refusing to help investigate what happened.<br /><br />Has anything like this happened to anyone here? Does anyone know how often bitcoin addresses on sites like Intersango cycle and what would happen if it cycles in the process of receiving a deposit? A member here once confirmed that a deposit still showed up after sending it to an old address on SR and that it generated a warning email, but does anyone know if this is the norm as far as bitcoin deposits go once an address changes?<br /><br />

Bit coins sent to an old address will still turn up in your account.<br /><br />Im not sure about intersango, they probably change all the time too but I assume the bits will still show up in your account even if the address changes.

				I don&#039;t know how often it changes because it doesn&#039;t appear to change every time I make a deposit. I do know that when I first started out on SR I sent my ฿s to the same addresses about twelve times before I noticed it changed, which made me panic the first time, but my coins still showed up as normal.<br /><br />Four days, mmmmm... That&#039;s a long time. If support say they have a record of the deposit, and if the transaction is stated to be successful and complete on Intersangos end (have you checked on the ฿ withdrawal page under this last withdrawal?), then I&#039;d say the ฿s have been successfully transferred to Silk Road, but there is some technical hitch this end with your Silk Road wallet that only support can sort out for you. I know there have been a few people recently who&#039;ve had to wait up to ten hours (or more?) for their ฿ deposits, but four days is way too long. :-\&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve found support in the past to be either really helpful and quick to respond or completely useless. Just keep trying them. Maybe someone on the forum can help you look into the block chain to find out conclusively where your ฿s have gone. Sorry I couldn&#039;t be more help.

				Although Intersango Ltd have been having big problems recently I really think that Bit Coin users should get fully behind them. They deserve our support 100% in these difficult times for them.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I issued my first withdrawal request - and it took nearly a week to process, but with plenty of communication from Intersango staff, via their excellent Support Ticket system explaining the difficulties they&#039;d been having and not to worry about it. Good as their word the money eventually appeared.<br />The last withdrawal request I placed with them last Friday was processed almost immediately, so they&#039;re obviously getting on top of the many issues that they were facing, almost everything being outside their control - ie suspicious banks and some customers trying to defraud them. <br /><br />Without companies such as Intersango Ltd, Bitcoin as a viable concept will be dead in the water.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Even if I bought my Bitcoin elsewhere for cash I&#039;d still need to sell them on a Currency Exchange.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t I?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				Seems the demons may be returning to Intersango...they been sat on a deposit of mine for most of the day now with satus showing as &#039;checked&#039; but not progressing beyond.<br /><br />Support are their usual helpful selves. <br /><br />Don&#039;t suppose anyone has had this &#039;checked&#039; issue before and got any idea what it means do they?
