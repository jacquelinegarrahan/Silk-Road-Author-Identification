				I went to a pharmacy today after going to a GNC and a vitamin shoppe to pick up some capsules thinking that i would be able to just walk in, buy them and walk out. After about 5 minutes of searching the store the woman behind the counter asked me if i needed any help so i casually asked if they had any capsules. she redirected me to the drop off window where i would be explained the procedure. I went to the drop off window and told the lady i wanted to buy capsules and she started asking for my info and i started panicking. Not wanting to look shady, i started giving her information as casually as possible but in my panicked state i gave her my real information. What happens now? What kind of database am i in?

				I hate to tell you, but it should have been obvious before you even went inside that buying anything from behind the counter would require some ID.

				Yeah, the DEA has a list of people they watch that buy empty pill capsules. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Grow some fucking balls, tell them to fuck off/ask why the hell they need any information.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell them you make multivitamin supplements and that&#039;s that.&nbsp; Jesus Christ some fucking people would do anything that anyone asks them to so.&nbsp; Just because the lowly pharmacist assistant wants to impose a bullshit rule doesn&#039;t mean that you have to follow it.

Anyway, to the OP, you don&#039;t have to go to a pharmacy to get empty caps, they sell&#039;em in lots of places like organic food shoppes and the like, and I never was asked&nbsp; anything, I just got the damned things myself and took them to the register. <br /><br />Also, yes, we have to learn to stop these vicarious little Party Members in their tracks; just be firm, &quot;I don&#039;t feel I have to tell you anything about me&quot; and be done with it. I still remember the first time I went to a bank to cash a third party check where I didn&#039;t have an account and the feeling of astonishment and rage that I felt when the teller asked me for a fingerprint! I said, no, I won&#039;t do that, forget it! And I walked out. I didn&#039;t cash the check, I suppose I persuaded the person to pay me in cash. <br /><br />And do you think I&#039;d ever submit to a fucking drug test for a job??? Absolutely no-fucking-way, man. Shove it up yours, I&#039;d say. I am done with boots on the face.

				I can walk around my local shopping plaza and there&#039;s packets of capsules you can see from the local fruit store!<br />This is in Australia, but you just grab them, walk up with some money and gtfo.<br /><br />Too easy :)<br />People use capsules for all sorts of things really..

				I&#039;d look elsewhere than a pharmacy. A lot of people pack their own pills with all kinds of medicinal herbs they grow themselves. I&#039;m growing a Moringa Oleifera tree that I plan on packing fresh pills with, though I haven&#039;t done it yet. Maybe some other stuff too, but I haven&#039;t decided. Not planning on going to a pharmacy, though; I think they&#039;re carried in a lot of other health food type stores, but it would probably be required to look around.

				What you did my friend, is wet your pants. Happens to everybody at sometime in their life. Ya choked, next time someone asks you something that makes you uncomfortable, even a little, respond with something designed to make them uncomfortable. Conversational engineering, 90% of the world just folds. Create your answer and store it in your brain somewhere. <br /><br />Next time just say, when asked anything, &quot;my disability precludes me from disclosing my personal information or discussing masturbation issues without my psychiatrist present&quot;.&nbsp; People will just walk away baffled, works every time.&nbsp; My grandmother stopped asking me about anything. After awhile, nobody will ask you anything. I told my boss to stop looking at my ass or I was going to file a discrimination lawsuit against him. I&#039;m a dude and so ain&#039;t he. I could shit on the floor in his office and he gives me atta-boys.
