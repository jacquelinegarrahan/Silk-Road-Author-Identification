				It sounds to me like he is telling the truth. In his mail, it said &quot;please don&#039;t re-ship as there is too much evidence against me&quot;.<br /><br />That is telling you not to re-ship, as he is afraid of more evidence racking up against him. Sounds very plausible to me ;)<br /><br />Hope this helps

				International mail to Australia gets seized much more regularly than mail to other countries. No package is immune from being seized. I have heard of people in USA who had letters without drugs in them opened and inspected by customs, so in all cases there is a probability that your package will be randomly inspected. The best you can possibly hope to do is try to keep the chance of thorough inspection equal to random chance selection. Australia thoroughly inspects more international mail than most countries do, and according to all the documentation available they do two stage screening on 100% of international mail.

I think he&#039;s more embarassed than anything else, and you lot don&#039;t even know who he is. <br /><br />Do I have to create a pop quiz to prove people have 2 cents about them before I sell to them? Perhaps. <br /><br />I do everything from my side to stay safe, least buyers can do is the same. Fuck the police.

				Ok asdf345. But while you are still in contact with them, please ask them exactly how they got busted.. There are currently 2 threads on this case, and some closure as to how they got busted would be of benefit. Rather than the speculation which is going on.

What a cunt of a situation. Decades ago my mum cut up not one, but TWO fake ID&#039;s I had from the RTA. At least she didn&#039;t turn me in to the cops, that&#039;s just fucked. It&#039;s restored my faith in domestic mail. I spend a considerable amount of time packing and ensuring the safety of my customers, so it looks like it&#039;s more likely a friend or relative will catch you than auspost to intercept the package. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47417.msg500071#msg500071">Quote from: grillzilla on October 03, 2012, 11:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ok asdf345.

Basically cops asked for his PC and threatened to get a search warrant and search everything if he didn’t. I’m sure if they could have gotten a warrant they would have already. I’m the under impression they now have his PC. He reckons they intercepted the parcel at the post office, but I seriously doubt that. The article says his parents turned him in. He hasn’t told me what happened yet. <br /><br />Anyone have a problem with me posting this? If so, feel free to PM and we can have it out there. As far as I’m concerned the SIX page thread on this is just as detailed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />
