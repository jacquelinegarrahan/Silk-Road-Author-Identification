				I want to do web therapy on SR.&nbsp; I work with addiction and whatever else comes through the door IRL.&nbsp; Can I do anonymous cam 2 cam or skype?&nbsp; Is there a voice chat I could do anonymous?&nbsp; It&#039;s not to really see each other anyway it&#039;s just to create the feeling of being in the room for web therapy.<br /><br />Let&#039;s face it AA isn&#039;t for everybody.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been through it..&nbsp; I think people in the SR community could use a psychologist that won&#039;t care if they&#039;re a dealer - I was one for years - or will understand if they want to quit cocaine but not lsd or whatever - AND will help them do it!&nbsp; I&#039;ll may even recommend research chemicals, smart drugs, or something else to help someone!&nbsp; I know I would&#039;ve paid to see me when I was rolling in the $$ and frustrated as hell with some problems...&nbsp; What does anybody think?

				You might take a look at Jitsi. It at least supports strong encryption.

				i dont know how well a video chat would run over tor, or how comfortable people will be showing there face. You are probably better of using a regular chat type of thing (IRC, IM etc). If you are able to setup a VPN with BTC, you could always use a free wifi hotspot around you, but you would want to be careful not to attract attention.

				No, such voice/video chat platforms are definitely not anonymous and voice chat over Tor would definitely not work because of the high latencies involved. Your best bet is good old text-based chat.

				^^I agree. There&#039;s no simple way to do it. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s possible, but the solution would not be profitable considering people would have to go out of their way to get it to work.
