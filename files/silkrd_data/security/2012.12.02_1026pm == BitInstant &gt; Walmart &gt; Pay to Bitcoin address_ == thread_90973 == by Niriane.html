				I don&#039;&#039;t know about the process, but I get tired of having to repeat this: don&#039;t send coins directly to your SR address. Launder them first, with the fog for instance. It&#039;s fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion.<br /><br />

				It doesn&#039;t say SR address, he may be transferring to a wallet address....<br /><br />I went there to check it out one time and you go to the service desk, grab a a blue form which you fill out with the appropriate information, such as your name and address and .... order information which is listed on the PDF from Bitinstant once you finish entering things in, chosing where you go, and hit accept.&nbsp; I believe you hand the blue sheet filled out to the associate and they enter the information into the computer, then you pay them and leave.<br />Not sure if I&#039;m missing anything since I&#039;ve only used the CVS red phone<br /><br />Anyway, good luck.

The only thing different about doing a transaction at walmart is that there is no red phone. Im not sure if all walamart&#039;s have this but the one I visited has a specific &quot;money center&quot; where you go to send moneygrams and such.

				I don&#039;t understand why some people say not to send directly to your SR wallet? SR fogs and tumbles the coins before they enter your wallet. Sure extra security is all fine and good but there still are some legal items on SR and either way they cant prove what exactly you spent the funds on.<br /><br />

				Have to admit that the Walmart option with the form to fill out is much easier then the &quot;redphone&quot; at CVS but Walmaqrt is 30 miles away vs. 2 miles to CVS for me. Remember people. All you are buying is money. The transaction is completely legal. Don&#039;t act or feel like your buying smack doing the transaction. This is the easiest of the easy transaction your trying to complete.
