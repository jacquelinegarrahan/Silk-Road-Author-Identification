				Hey y&#039;all!<br /><br />I am a new buyer here. I&#039;d like to get started building karma, but I am unsure how to do it. How do I build my karma?<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve looked over some of the posts, and I really like the idea of escrow. How do I get that going?<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to start playing with bitcoins yet, because it seems like too much of a financial outlay to start. Can I use escrow with moneypak cards?<br /><br />I only wanna hook up to get a little bit of cannabis for my own limited personal use. I&#039;ve dealt with several good people over the internet before, but I&#039;ve been getting burned too much recently. So I hope this is a better avenue. How do I get started?

				I&#039;d read a bunch on the forum here, but you don&#039;t make purchases on the forum and karma has nothing to do with anything. You can ONLY pay with bitcoins, there are many different ways, and guides, on how to do that.<br /><br />On the main SR site, I&#039;d recommend you read the Buyer&#039;s Guide first. After you have a handle on that I&#039;d recommend reading this guide on how to use PGP encryption, which is the only way you should ever provide your name and address to a vendor: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0

				Ok karma is related to The forum only and does not impact on your ability to use SR. Appears you can only give karma once you pass the 100 post limit and you are limited to giving one per day. Anyway you probably don&#039;t want to concern yourself with that.<br /><br />The best thing you can do is lurk the forums and read the sticky posts in each section to familiarise yourself with the site.<br /><br />You are going to need bitcoins, no two ways about it.<br /><br />If you are in the UK/EU contact vlad1m1r he will take cash in the post and convert it to bitcoins anonymously. Using moneypak or similar will no doubt end with you getting scanned as a new user.<br /><br />Order small at first as you have no feedback buyers will be wary if large orders from an unproven buyer.<br /><br />You will need bitcoins so if you want to use SR get familiar with them. Ultimately you are not going to buy loads of cheap drugs on SR, what you will get is a quality product, a secure anonymous and safe service. You pay a premium for this compared to street prices but the benefits outweigh the negatives considerably.

I suggest you read the buyer&#039;s guide on the Silk Road site itself to get yourself started. If you need any further info please don&#039;t hesitate to ask. Try not to worry too much about the karma system for now - it won&#039;t impinge much on your ability to buy things.<br /><br />It might be a little difficult to place large orders at first as sellers need to be able to trust buyers won&#039;t falsely claim they never received their products when they actually have and get back the money from escrow. As such I suggest you start small - hit up the seller CaptainPicard for a few porno videos for instance just to get your reputation to a level where you can show you&#039;ll be trusted.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
