				Google Bitcoin wallet passphrase cracking. There are methods and programs to do it, though as can be expected it&#039;s an inefficient process.

				That sucks. When I first started on SR, I sent coins through BitCoinFog and as soon as I did, I forgot the password I used. Gone forever. Lesson learned. Also, don&#039;t be high when creating passwords related to financial transactions. Protip! haha

				My passphrase was probably around 10 characters and I&#039;ve tried everything I can think of.&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched Google about working on this.&nbsp; I just figured there had to be someone out there who had a tool that could decrypt your wallet.dat file or something.&nbsp; People crack shit all the time so I figured this couldn&#039;t be as hard as everyone says it is.&nbsp; Apparently it is and I&#039;m fucked.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, thanks.&nbsp; If anyone has something I&#039;d gladly hand over $500 in bitcoins.&nbsp;

				&quot;John the Ripper&quot; may help. But I don&#039;t know how long it would take to crack a 10 character password with it. Depends on if you used numbers and punctuation.

				Happened to me once. I left it alone and the pword came back to me one day. I&#039;d try to relax and forget about it and maybe it will pop back into your mind. Now I keep every pword in an encrypted notepad file. It&#039;s important to write it down as soon as you make one.

				I&#039;d probably be reading more into memory and brain function then how to brute force attack encryption. Maybe there are exercises or foods or activities that can relax your memory part of your brain a bit. I&#039;d probably leave it alone for a day, get some good sleep, then go for a peaceful walk and see if it hits you.

				What wallet were you using?&nbsp; Different wallets require different approaches to retrieve or decrypt a lost passphrase.&nbsp; So providing that important bit of information will aid anyone who might be able to help in determining how likely they are to be able to assist.
