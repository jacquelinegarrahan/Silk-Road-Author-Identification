				So i&#039;ve just found out about buying bitcoins with Bitinstant via bank transfer. I need some info before I try this. <br />let me see if i have this right. if not, somebody please chime in.<br />go to bitinstant.com and choose cash bank deposit to mt.gox.<br />i put in my mt.gox account number in destination account. <br />a transaction page pops up and i print it out and take it to chase or wells fargo.<br />i go to the bank and say i need to make an out of state deposit?&nbsp; <br />i give them the transaction page i printed out?<br />i&#039;m confused about this part. <br />i get home and check my email. <br />i get a mt.gox code in my email to enter into mt.gox somewhere to add funds to my mt.gox account. <br />with the funds in my mt.gox account i can buy bitcoins. <br />i buy bitcoins and send them to an e wallet (i use strongcoin)<br />from my e wallet i send them through bitcoinfog. <br />from bitcoinfog i send them back to my e wallet or to SR. <br /><br />is this right? <br />does anybody else use mt.gox?<br /><br />i&#039;ve been using moneypaks and sometimes they take a while. i&#039;ve heard using this method you can have the coins in less than 4 hours, and the fee is only 4.50% + 1.00. and bitcoin fog only charges 1-3%, which is still cheaper and faster than Moneypaks. Most people are just sketchy about going into the bank so thats why they use MP. <br /><br />also if anyone knows, i&#039;ve been reading about how mt.gox accounts get frozen when they try to withdraw their Bitcoins. can they freeze my account if i buy the coins and send them to my e wallet? <br /><br />if anyone knows anything about this, please reply. <br />

				I&#039;ve used Mt.Gox, but I purchased my BTC by simply making a cash deposit into their account.<br />What&#039;s the benefit of using Bitinstant, compared a cash deposit to Mt.Gox?<br /><br />Thanks

				I have the Bitcoins in my MtGox account thank you BitInstant cash deposit! - Screw Dwolla! - Now! How do I get my BTC from MtGox to SR? Can I do it directly? Do I really need to open an account with ANOTHER website? Jeez, just doing my 1st transaction after a month of waiting, and I&#039;ve been through hell! - My seller is ready, I&#039;m ready. I did download the whole Bitcoin program a month ago but was told by an &quot;expert&quot; that I didn&#039;t need it. Advice please?

				Well I searched a little better on Mt Gox&#039;s grossly disorganized site, and found the big secret. I have to send a scan of my drivers license and a current utility bill. How did I miss that? Well I&#039;m ADHD-PI and &quot;under medicated&quot; if you know what I mean. So someone tell me it&#039;s ok to do that. I do see that I should&#039;ve given my SR BTC addy and not just let it flow to MT Gox directly. <br />Geez Louise! This is a challenge! I&#039;m a stupid old man, but I know a hell of a lot less intelligent people my age, and they wouldn&#039;t even have gotten to this point!<br />Help!

Gox on principal, they will cooperate with LE in a heartbeat.&nbsp; However, don&#039;t just send it from Mt. Gox to SR; at least send it to an Instawallet first, or better yet, send it through BitcoinFog (takes minimum of 6 hours).<br /><br />Your SR purchases are only anonymous if your coins are too.&nbsp; Take every possible precaution to prevent being ID&#039;d when obtaining coins, and clean them well before purchasing.&nbsp; Good luck!

				Thank you so much for that quick reply. I literally just cleared off my the crap on my scanner to do it! - Stopped cold. <br />Well MT Gox is giving me a message that I can&#039;t do ANYTHING with my BTC&#039;s until my acct is VERIFIED! What the hell do I do? They got my $, they make the rules! <br />I can show them ID, and then forward to my Bitcoin wallet, then to SR.<br />Can anyone else tell me if I&#039;m forced to send them this ID? They offer no alternative. <br />Once in my Bitcoin wallet, I can go to SR anonymously through TOR, so what&#039;s the issue really?<br />I won&#039;t do anything until I get an answer, but thank you again!

				Honestly, if they&#039;re going to require ID to use your funds, I would just take the loss as a learning experience.&nbsp; I hope someone else more versed in the workings of Mt. Gox can give some advice on where to go from here.<br /><br />If you give them your ID, your coins WILL be able to be traced to you.&nbsp; The one exception to this seems to be if you use a blind signature mixer, though don&#039;t ask me what that is (Pine just started talking about it in the thread I will link momentarily).&nbsp; Tor does not protect you in the way you&#039;re imagining.&nbsp; Please read this thread, particularly the posts by Pine, for more information on the anonymity of your coins: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22447.0

				it was all a misunderstanding. I didn&#039;t need to send any id. Either way, you dont need mt gox anymore. use bitinstant, cash deposit, lf u can get to one of their locs easily. Cash Deposit to Email, then it brings you to&nbsp; Coinapult, where, u send it to your SR account .&nbsp; Done in under 2 hours.-
