				Hi all,<br /><br />I am a total noob at btc so please help out if you can. I have cash on hand ready to go to make an order. All I gotta<br />do is buy bitcoins and then get them to my vendor of choice. Can someone fill in the blanks for me on the best or any safe<br />way of going about it. <br /><br />Like I can see loads of sites offering to sell me the bitcoins but I am new and need a jump start to know a easy full proof way<br />of going from my euros&gt;btc&gt;SR vendor<br /><br />My home country is Ireland if thats any help.<br /><br />I was going to make an order today but by the time I had enough cash the banks were closed. So that option is out until<br />Monday morning, What are my other options like buying BTC with a Visa debit card? <br /><br />I really hope someone can help and in the future I can pass what I learn on again.<br /><br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; :)

				I wouldn&#039;t use a Visa. Maybe you can try localbitcoins.com ? They offer online banking and face-to-face deals.

				I&#039;m not sure if this is viable on your Emerald Isle, and it most likely wouldn&#039;t happen until Moday, but here&#039;s how I use LocalBitcoins to purchase my Coin:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213288.msg1567981#msg1567981">Quote from: GrimWaldo on September 27, 2013, 12:48 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">LocalBitcoins is great!<br /><br />1) Find a seller who will accept a cash deposit at a bank in your area. It doesn&#039;t matter where the seller is located.<br />2) Go into the bank&#039;s lobby and grab a handfull of deposit slips from the kiosk, maybe 10 or 12 of &#039;em.<br />3) Fill out the deposit slip and use the drive-thru for all of your cash deposits. Simple.<br /><br />The only thing more anonymous would be cash-by-mail... a risk I personally am not willing to take.<br />Use LBC. They directly empower buyers and sellers of BitCoin while keeping your money safe.<br />The seller must place BTC in escrow to make the sell. If they refuse to release your Coin after you make payment, you can send the deposit info to LocalBitcoins and they&#039;ll release your BTC after confirming it with the bank. Nice and safe. DO IT!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you use an anonymous e-mail, then this is the most anonymous methos I know besides cash-in-the-mail Hope that helps at all.
