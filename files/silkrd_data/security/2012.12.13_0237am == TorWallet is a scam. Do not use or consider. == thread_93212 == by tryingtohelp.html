				Yes this has been said here quite a few time before - looking for reviews before trying a new service might prove itself as a good idea...

				Use the blockchin man and make up a user name and password for each wallet. i have used tor wallet for a test after reading horrible reviews but wouldnt trust them even though i was successful.. just keep it simple and dont leave money in accounts and never download software because they can steal your bitcoin with a miner or a sniffer while you are asleep. wake up and bam the shit is gone.

				Yah you&#039;re definitely not alone. I used it without looking up reviews and lost 8 bitcoins last week. Now I just use the Blockcahin wallet and Bitcoin qt running through tor. You only have to learn that lesson once!

				While I was searching for a bitcoin while I ran across several scam wallets. I only use https://blockchain.info/wallet&nbsp; now. I didnt need to download anything and it works well so far at least.

Everyone who uses bitcoins should read bitcointalk.org regularly. There&#039;s a whole subforum for bitcoin services<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=85.0<br /><br />and another one on scam accusations<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0<br /><br />Every new exchange and wallet service gets a dedicated thread. TorWallet had a dedicated thread, and people figured out it was a scam back in September. In fact, if you do a Google search for &quot;TorWallet&quot;, the SECOND result is this thread<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=112327.0<br /><br />I&#039;m amazed that people still send their money to those scammers.
