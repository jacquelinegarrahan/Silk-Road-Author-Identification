				Schumer can kiss my ass left &amp; right !&nbsp; Silk Road never dies !!<br /><br /><br />Original Thread here:&nbsp; http://thelcn.com/2011/06/06/schumer-calls-on-dea-shut-down-hardcore-drug-website/<br /><br /><br /><br />Senator Chuck Schumer has called upon federal agents (http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/123187958.html) to shut down an illegal drug trafficking website operating in plain sight. The website (http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable) which is known as “Silk Road anonymous marketplace” is designed specifically for the marketing of drugs and other illicit materials. Shoppers on the site are required to use anonymizing proxy servers and anonymous money known as “Bitcoins” and can select from sellers offering drugs ranging from cannabis to methamphetamine. Users say that the online forum allows them to obtain their drugs in relative safety, without having to interact with the criminal underworld and street crime associated with more traditional means of purchasing illegal substances.<br />According to Schumer however, the fun is almost over. “The DEA has confirmed they are aware of the site, and . . . they won’t confirm or deny that an investigation is underway,” he told reporters Sunday, “From my years of experience, I’d bet my bottom dollar in this instance there is one underway.” The website has only been operating since February, and has only just now begun to generate buzz in the general public, prompting authorities to take a closer look.<br />“It’s a certifiable one-stop shop for illegal drugs that represents the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen. It’s more brazen than anything else by lightyears,” said Schumer.
