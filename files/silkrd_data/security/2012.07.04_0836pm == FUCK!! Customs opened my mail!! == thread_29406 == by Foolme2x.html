				Did they give you a letter or note explaining things?<br /><br />If not, then your letter just got damaged, probably by the airport staff and they just taped it up, or stole your stuff. Happens all the time.<br /><br />Customs don&#039;t open it, take stuff out and tape it then send it on to you.

				Depending on the amount I think you&#039;d be questioned before apprehended. But it wouldn&#039;t make sense for customs to resend you evidence.

The tape is clearly Federal Government..so I highly doubt that it&#039;s some mail carrier ripping me off here.I have also had previous items not showing up when expected without reason this last month. This envelope was clearly INTERCEPTED. If they had any manners they should have at least left a thank you note.<br /><br />PLEASE I NEED ADVICE HERE GUYS: I am justifiably paranoid and freaking out here. I contacted vendor and now he&#039;s freaked out and has to change shit around..Cleaned my internet history, drug links,removed drugs and associated paraphenallia off premises... so if I was raided I don&#039;t have anything...I am &quot;clean&quot;...although I still have my computer. Should I scrub it of all data?? How do I do that?? Any sensible advice?? <br /><br />I feel like I am totally being watched now. FUCK!!! I can only assume that any future orders will be intercepted should I be stupid enough to use this address again.

				Don&#039;t belive the hype of the posters above...&nbsp; mostly uninformed BS.<br /><br />If you get a package siezed which is under a threshold (unknown what exactly the threshholds are), Dept. of Homeland Security Customs &amp; Border Patrol will send you a separate &quot;love letter&quot; saying that they took your items and that you have a certain number of days to petition to get them back.&nbsp; Sometimes the letter is sent via certified mail, sometimes not.<br />If you don&#039;t do anything in response you can expect the following:<br /><br />1) International shipments to that address will be scrutinized.&nbsp; Specifically if the name matches the seized package.&nbsp; Sometimes other packages will make it through if they were sent around the same time... seems like it takes a bit for the system to update.<br /><br />2) You may be stopped the next time you travel internationally.&nbsp; They will take you aside and ask you a litany of questions and go through everything in your bags (both carry-on and checked).&nbsp; You will also get special treatment when you arrive back in the US.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have anything incriminating on you they&#039;ll just let you pass.<br />If this happens, then you are on the DHS CBP watch list.&nbsp; You can petition to get off via TRIP, but they&#039;ll just give you a redress number.&nbsp; You can&#039;t get off the list.<br /><br />If the amount seized was not a large amount then you really don&#039;t have much to worry about.&nbsp; If the amount seized was large enough to warrant further investigation then they won&#039;t send you a letter, but instead will open a case on you and eventually bust you (Check out the story of Enelsyon from OVDB).&nbsp; Sometimes they will even let the packages go through to observe you picking them up.<br /><br />That said... I&#039;ve a friend who has received at least 7 letters in the past 4 years (all for either tiny amounts, or pot seeds from NL) and nothing has come of it.<br /><br />Watch yourself... stay safe... buy domestic from now on, and use a new address just to be safe.

				i dunno man, if it were me? well i&#039;d probably just eat a breakfast burrito or something and continue on. but thats cause im a big fat n lazy bastard<br /><br />customs gives letters, not what happened in your case so i&#039;d bet some wise postal worker had sticky fingers and made it look like so. i wouldnt worry, you&#039;d already have the knock n talk by now. as for future incoming orders? cross your fingers, stop ordering to that address (get a new one via private box) and get fucking serious about your itsec . it makes you &#039;feel better&#039; and it seems to me you&#039;re into that kind of shit. you should be on tor thru liberte on a thumbdrive, nothing to ever clear or wipe on your harddrive. read up smoke a fatty, and chill<br /><br />also-give your local mailman the stank eye

I have heard of people getting very delayed knock and talk visits after having packages go missing, but they did not receive a package with customs tape on it. I have heard of customs tape being on some orders that still had contraband in them that customs had missed, so I would check really closely to make sure the order is not there. Customs uses special tape to tape up anything they have to open and inspect. If you are absolutely sure that your order is not there, I would clean house immediately and quite possibly not accept any incoming orders. I bet you wish you used a PO box with a fake ID.

				It is also possible that some mail employee down the line stole your package and taped it back up with customs tape to make it so you wouldn&#039;t report something was stolen, but I don&#039;t see why they would do that as you would not report an illegal drug package anyway. In my experience thieves working at sorting facilities are about as good at finding drugs in the mail as customs or USPI are, stolen drugs in the mail is not unheard of.

				I watched a or read a piece that explained that the LE would remove most of the illegal product for evidence, repackage it, and then control deliver it. Wait a few minutes for the person to open it then bust in. In this particular piece it turned out when they busted the girl she had nothing in her illegal in her home I think because her friend ordered it for him at her place IIRC, so it was a waste of the LE&#039;s time in general.

				Definitely get the computers out of your house.&nbsp; There are ways to scrub the drives, but easier for you probably to just get them out of the place for now.&nbsp; If you do get a &quot;knock-and-talk&quot; don&#039;t volunteer any information.&nbsp; Nothing you say to LE can ever benefit you.&nbsp; God made criminal defense attorneys for a very good reason.&nbsp; Always remember if they had enough to arrest you then you would be under arrest.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good on you for cleaning your crib.&nbsp; Keep it clean.&nbsp; I realize that you are afraid and you think your address is being &quot;watched&quot; and maybe it is but there is also an excellent chance that it is not.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I would do two things: 1) clean house of all illegal substances whatsoever.&nbsp; 2) Encrypt your hard drive(s) with trucrypt.&nbsp; hxxp://www.truecrypt.org/<br /><br />If your other packages show up, don&#039;t sign for anything, write &quot;return to sender&quot; on them, and pray to Jesus Malverde.

				If you have a friend willing to run your machines in their house, and leave them on, then you could scrub the harddrives etc. However, it&#039;s a very slow process, can be as slow as a day for each GB of your harddrives&#039;s capacities.

				OP - hope I can help out with some info.&nbsp; (ALL READERS.... forgive for the long post... I&#039;m fucked the fucked up :) I might imagine i have your support hahah!<br /><br />As everyo0ne says clean your house n such... but ultimately.. what I&#039;ve found from real life and other real lifers... is... here it is: There&#039;s kinda two ways to handle cop interactions (IMO).... 1, you stay silent n basically &quot;fuck off pig JUST because ALL YOUR doinG is asking questions&quot; ....which don&#039;t mean shit. no matter what they say, threaten or whatever bs.... cause ur smart! OR sometimes.... you talk and try and be the law abiding citezen with your story of how ur do only good things. OOR... there&#039;s the option of just giving up becuase they chided you into it and you suck and hate your life for ever. <br /><br />What MY experience was................... I got blind sided. Played. Fucked. Non SR related. See... I&#039;d had a few stops... for ins. reg n shit... speeding cpl x&#039;s. And I got decent cool cops. even when i had nutty shit on me. So i decided like a mofo.... to pull that same game. Be compliant (but i was so high on bud chronicly that i didn&#039;t realize it was a one color narc vehicle.... and proceeded to stop without any aware prepping... airing out etc..... fucKing TALKITIVE. pulled over n shit. what do you do? guy was so nice too... hey oh don&#039;t worry about it... just a warning.... yea..... right. <br /><br />My problem there... was that I took ZERO initiative. no, ACTION for gettin rolled to the side of the road with an unmarked cop suv. <br /><br />My main point here (sorry for the rant/random/tangents..) is that we often can get caught off guard, no matter how many times we&#039;ve heard &quot;KEEP YOUR FUCKIN&#039; MOUTH SHUT!), and know it too.... and for some fucking reason... we talk. even if just a little bit. So look............................................... as long as you don&#039;t FAIL when they visit someday and start BLASTING you with questions.... just make sure you know it&#039;s fuckiin GAME TIME! when they appear. It&#039;s fuckin game time. play the game. Because the first bits of questions can be benign and get you talkin. And yknow.... like a fuckin moron.... i WOKE UP in the middle of gettin fulley ROLLED and searched... and realized they played me. All nice n shit at first.... oh it&#039;s just a minor nothing don&#039;t worry.... and then it goes to.... uh yeah ur gonna hve to get outta the car coo? yea you don&#039;t have a choice. <br /><br />That&#039;s what I heard. Now... because i was well... VERY LOADED on cannabis... and the car reeked... AND i didn&#039;t even GET what was happenin... I submitted. Like a bitch. I could have said many things. I could have politely held my ground but I didn&#039;t. So it was my lesson. My experience teaching me that next time... if there is one... I will conduct myself and a honoring, respectable remedy provider and educate the gun holder and create a much different outcome. I promise guys if you learn right you can hold those who invade your peace/privacy/personal private contract... you can hold them publicly financially responsible for their foul. Meaning legal ratification if you can handle the education and hours required to learn how to handle that sort of business, Remedy basically. For any error legally. REALLY. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry duders. I think (IMO of course) that it is really possible to educate ourselves and our friends and our loved ones in a way that STUMPS the status quo. That is a &quot;way out&quot; of.... how can i say this. getting reamed for 20 or 30 or something so disgusting that it&#039;s beyond ALL of us that it&#039;s truly existing. I mean...... for ME! I live in a very weird fuckin bubble! I see all others as equals. I don&#039;t blame any ONE for MY EXPERIENCE. The AUTHORITIES~~! It&#039;s all indoctrination. It&#039;s domestication, complacency, competition... constant competition... conventionalism... sheeeeeeeit. I don&#039;t know what to make of it. Education (non conventional)&nbsp; is the only way for ME. <br /><br />So for OP bitch. Just never utter a fuckin word and they have NOTHING. be polite and wish them a very good day but don&#039;t trip too hard. Learn who you truly are. Learn that you are not your straw man. If you can get that you&#039;ll be on to some very wonderful things about life and kowledge. <br /><br />Peace everyone. I am fucked up. <br /><br /><br />P.s&nbsp; oh yeah.... the solution... stay regional DUDE! scuks a bit on prices and availability but ykonw... regional should be fine.

				Dont panic so much just take precautions Either Dban your harddrives or like others said move your computer to a friends house, dont admit to anything if they coming knocking to your house just say you know nothing about it, make sure your house is empty of any contraband and make sure your not using tor at home or at least use a Tor relay and then just sit tight you will be ok! But it really does sound like the mail man/mail sorter has taken the items from inside as you havent had a love letter.<br /><br />Hope everything goes ok! Peace.
