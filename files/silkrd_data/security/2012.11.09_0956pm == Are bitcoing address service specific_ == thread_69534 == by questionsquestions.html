				Since the reason behind your question is obvious, just create a wallet to sit between your account and the other person&#039;s. Send it the bitcoins, then send the bitcoins on, then delete said account. The more Temporary Wallets, the harder to find the paper trail. At some point though, it becomes redundant.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know is the actual answer to your question.<br /><br />Hope I helped. :P<br /><br />- The Consultant

The answer is no. There is no way the bitcoin exchange can see that the BitCoin came from Silk Road.<br /><br />There is one caveat. The Silk Road server obviously does know which BTC addresses are used. If something happens to the SR server (for example it gets hacked or confiscated by the police), and that information gets compromised, then the person with that data can see which BTC accounts are from Silk Road.<br /><br />As long as Silk Road is safe and running, there is no way the BTC exchange can see from what BTC wallet the coins came.<br /><br />As the consultant suggested, you can bounce your BitCoin through various addresses before you send them to the exchange. For that, I would install the bitcoin client. Then you can create as many wallets on your computer as you like. Be sure to make a backup of your wallet file after those addresses have been created.<br /><br />You can also use BitCoin fog. Then the origin of your coins is downright untraceable, but it will cost you a small fee (1 to 3%).

				You can find bitcoinfog here: fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion<br /><br />It is a&nbsp; Tor hidden service. They basically have a big pool of bitcoins, divided over many wallets, that they mix and tumble all the time. The bitcoin you send them will be mixed with their pool. A few hours or days later, they will send your coins from another wallet of their pool. You can also choose to spread the payout over several wallets. <br /><br />That way there is absolutely no traceability between your SR address and the BitCoin exchange address. If something that elaborate is actually required is a debatable topic though.
