				So it looks like we can&#039;t use intersango anymore, which is a shame because I really liked how they did things. I&#039;ve been looking at mt gox as an alternative but that doesn&#039;t seem hugely private and I&#039;m not sure if they take transfers from a GBP bank, can anyone clarify?<br /><br />So UK, where&#039;re you getting your coins now?

				Couldn&#039;t you transfer the money to their polish EUR bank account? Your bank will probably levy a fee for the conversion GBP--&gt;EUR but still way better then getting goxed or gixed.

				It all depends on what your buying lets say if your buying an&nbsp; 1/8 of weed a week, here on silk road getting your coins from mtgox will be fine, you will not be flagged up by police postoffice mtgox or any other agency your just to small and insufficient to them . I would be more cautious if i were a vendor tho , but as a small time user of soft drugs fuck them !!!&nbsp; <br />bank transfer to mtgox&nbsp; with aml&nbsp; with a uk account.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				This is hellish. Been a member of SR for nearly a year and never had any issues acquiring bitcoins in the UK till now. Can anyone offer advice on where to even LOOK for other alternatives?&nbsp; (only joined forums today due to this, been raiding every corner of the interweb for hours)

				Yeah, me and a mate have had the same problem today. Can anyone recommend a good BTC exchange which allows GBP bank transfers?&nbsp; pls PM me with recommendations. If someone can get me hooked up with a reliable UK source it&#039;s worth a bitcoin of the few remaining coins I still have in my wallet!!<br /><br />I&#039;m also interested in any Aussie sites as I have a bank a/c over there with funds....&nbsp; <br /><br />The way I see it, there are two possible reasons for this. <br /><br />1.) The type of account that Intersango / Mt.Gox have with Barclays is not a proper business account, and therefore they&#039;re not paying fee&#039;s on money being deposited into the account. This might explain why Barclays have restricted the number of deposits, and are trying to make them switch to a business account where they have to pay fees, and would then no doubt have to pass them onto people like us.<br /><br />2.) The establishment are cracking down on Bitcoins.&nbsp; It&#039;s fair to say they don&#039;t like this free-market currency as THEY don&#039;t have any control over it, and therefore can&#039;t impose fees or follow the money. Also, it must be very difficult to attack the SR as it&#039;s concealed on the Tor network, but it&#039;s far easier to attack the way people get their bcs, by making things difficult for the Bitcoin-exchange websites.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used to get my coins from Intersango, but they had a similar problem and are no longer able to accept UK bank transfers.<br /><br />The crazy thing is, who ever heard of a bank that didn&#039;t accept money!!??&nbsp; This is a big concern for all of us.&nbsp; I would say something is going down behind the scenes and this is part of an orchestrated plan by the establishment.<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />PTF

				I have access to a French bank account which is going to prove very handy but with Mtgox you are required to verify which I&#039;m not prepared to do.<br /><br />I think Limitless is suggesting that you send money to a european bank and trade from there.<br /><br />So back to where it all started Intersango but now trading in the Euro.

				Limetless, even if you could open a European bank account (which seems pretty difficult to me) you&#039;d still have to send the money via swift/iban from your domestic account which can cost up to £20, and that&#039;s before you pay the exchanger&#039;s fees.

Has anybody made GBP deposits to Mtgox recently? I know they&#039;ve had their issues with the amount of transactions they can process, which is why I waited until Tuesday.

				Hey UK Based People:<br /><br />&nbsp;Can I just confirm that PartTimeFiend&#039;s experience was almost exactly the same as mine, totally positive...<br /><br />Very easy, just used the &quot;Euro&quot; deposit details on the Intersango site, transfer my pounds (£&#039;s) into their Polish account (which will be converted to Euro&#039;s in the process by the way) and then credited to my Intersango account. <br /><br />My Bitcoins were available the very next day... <br />(This was due to a late afternoon deposit, could be quicker I reckon).<br /><br />Bank: Barclays<br />Charge: £15<br /><br /><br />:)<br />

				Stop, stop, stop, all of you, and listen to what I have to say... that is, if you have an IPhone or Android Smartphone... <br /><br />Head over to &lt;clearnet&gt; www.blockchain.info and create an &#039;account&#039; / set up for a new online Bitcoin Wallet. Once setup, you&#039;ll notice that there&#039;s a Barclays Pingit option for deposits. It&#039;s really simple, and you don&#039;t even need to have a Barclays account in order to use their application. <br /><br />Just have a read of this page... <br /><br />https://blockchain.info/wallet/deposit-pingit<br /><br />You&#039;ll get instructions on-screen via BlockChain, and their fee is only 0.97%. You simply input the amount you want to deposit, in GBP, example, £250, and then it&#039;ll come up with a Phone Number that you send the payment to, via the PingIt Iphone/ Android application. The great thing is, the money will appear in your account as Bitcoins, rather than GBP. The conversion at &quot;market rate&quot; is already done for you. Apparently, if you&#039;ve got a Barclays account, it can be 1 - 10 minutes before seeing the funds in your account, but otherwise it&#039;s the norm - up to 24 hours. <br /><br />I know some people will want the choice of what rate they buy their coins at, but as UK users seem to be running out of options, and with the relevant ease of this new application, its the way forward for me and I&#039;ll continue to use it, and recommend it to people, until there&#039;s a problem. <br /><br />Note, £250 deposit limit per week. That kind of sucks...

				I got bit by MtGox&#039;s problems too - there&#039;s now a few hundred of my GBP floating in the ether &#039;til they sort it.<br /><br />Buying BTC by bank transfer doesn&#039;t strike me as a massively safe thing to do. Unless I&#039;m mistaken it wouldn&#039;t be hard for LE to subpoena the vendor (mtgox, intersango, whoever) to ask where BTC came from, and they could pass on your bank details, from which they could easily get an address etc. Which is why I was happy doing cash deposits with MtGox.<br /><br />Cash for BTC through the post seems like it could work, but obviously the chances of getting scammed (or fucked by royal mail) are pretty high. I don&#039;t live close to any bitcoin vendors on bitcoinlocal. Is there a safe-ish way to buy BTC through the post, e.g. with a reliable &#039;vendor rating&#039; system, like SR uses?

				Actually, reading more, it looks like bitcoin-otc is the obvious choice, at least for those of us who are happy to learn new stuff (which being on SR, is quite likely). I think I should be able to find a trader who will deal with cash in the mail, but even if not, bank transfer isn&#039;t as dangerous as the risks of a trader being approached by LE should be way lower than e.g. MtGox. Exciting times ahead.<br /><br />Underground markets fun and interesting :)

				localbitcoins is probably the most anonymous way to obtain your coins, lots of sellers offer direct bank transfers so you dont even need to be that local, just find someone selling at the price you want to buy.

				Just noticed today that Bit Instant now have a &#039;Bank Transfer &gt; Bitcoin Address&#039; option for the UK (select the flag at the top of the page). Went through the motions on the site, but my bank isn&#039;t one of the ones listed (Nat West, Santander, and few others) so I couldn&#039;t try it out. Paying into a bank with cash doesn&#039;t seem to be an option unfortunately, but I&#039;d be interested to know if anyone in the UK uses this service successfully.

				I done my first transfer a week ago to buy bitcoins.I used Mt. Gox to do this, i wanted to send 150, but the cost to do an international&nbsp; bank transfer was 30..so all in i transferred 180. Got the coins after 4 days for the transfer to go through.<br /><br />Also today i thought i would try Bitstamp, i sent 100 through SEPA, i think it was 10 i got charged to do this. But the money was there in an hour and a half! so i just bought the coins straight away. Certainly alot quicker using bitstamp and the SEPA method.<br /><br />I&#039;m willing to buy ukash vouchers once i find a shop that sells them,and give that a go.<br /><br />Just new here but so far enjoying having a good look around and learning a shit load from the forums!<br /><br />Cheers all

				I originally got my first bitcoins through MtGox before Uk transfers were stopped. Since then found it hard to find a way to get some without paying over the odds which I really didnt want to do. Blockchain pingit seems the best way but I dont have a smartphone so cant use it. I finally used Bitstamp last night and I&#039;m pretty happy with it. Transferred 170 euros or £144 from my bank account, had to pay a £9.50 fee, but only afterwards found a code for Halifax that takes £2 off, GOHX10 for anyone with a halifax bank account. Ended up with $219 in the bitstamp account, so lost around $10 as well as the £9.5. Bitcoin prices not too bad either, basically the same as mtgox. So anyone trying to get coins I would suggest pingit or if you cant do that bitstamp.

				I&#039;ve finally got some Bitcoins through Intersango! <br /><br />I did a bank transfer through their Euro account, paid a £10 bank charge and the money was in the next day. Not a problem.<br />What took the most time was the exchanging for Bitcoins as I didn&#039;t set it as market value so while I was trying to get value for money, it did take over 2 weeks for someone to accept my offer, which was pretty much near to market price anyway. Oh well....<br /><br />So to anyone that might still be a bit lost, although this thread has had some great advice and I&#039;m sure people will be pointed in the right direction now, I recommend the Intersango method.<br /><br />Also I got a reply of PrincessHIGH with some suggestions, she was a great help but I&#039;m not sure if she is still PMing people
