				I think you&#039;re being too paranoid too soon. Three weeks does not seem like a long time to me. I&#039;ve read on here some packages taking over a month. I&#039;ve ordered twine samples from Thailand, and they took almost a month to the day to get here. Even if it did get intercepted, how would they prove you ordered it? Deny deny deny!!!<br /><br />Just my $.02

				Calm down. It is the sellers on here who take the risk, the imports guys really don&#039;t give a toss about a small amount of drugs meant for personal use they are highly unlikely to bother wasting man power and time doing a controlled delivery because 1 parcel addressed to you happened to have drugs inside it. <br /><br />They can&#039;t prove that you ordered them and having tor on your computer doesn&#039;t prove anything. If anything using PO boxes etc is worse as then it can look like you knew you&#039;d be having illicit parcels arriving and hence bought a PO box (especially if you have no excuse or real reason for a PO box).

				I think you should stop ordering drugs in the mail.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or at the very least only use domestic vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;YOU ARE WAY TOO PARANOID.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paranoia self destroya

				I feel your pain.&nbsp; The paranoia will pass with time.&nbsp; I suspect the outgoing country more commonly seizes more than receiving country.&nbsp; Particularly NL, as far as I know all mail for the country goes through Amsterdam; that is why most don&#039;t receive a love letter.&nbsp; I am one that likes to experiment search out the truth.&nbsp; I was concerned about a &quot;watch list&quot; for a while, so to test it I ordered a small amount of product from a well known expert of packaging that should only have been discovered if they were looking at my package close.&nbsp; I also accidentally (Thought they were domestic) ordered some pills with average packaging from a lower risk country and those made it too.&nbsp; My summation is if you keep it to personal use, fly under the radar, keep the receiving house clean...your more likely to be injured driving to the store.

				You shouldn&#039;t be that concerned. Most people are talking about orders taking a month at maximum, but one time one of my orders took 4 months. It wasn&#039;t off of SR, mind you, but I got the DCN-equivalent information for a Polish package, and gave up on it about a month after it shipped, but it still found its way to me 3 months after I gave up.<br /><br />That&#039;s pretty unlikely, but if the US intercepts it they will send you a love letter; I&#039;ve gotten one myself (for importing MXE, which was bullshit), but I didn&#039;t really consider that it might be intercepted in the sending country, too. Do they really do that?
