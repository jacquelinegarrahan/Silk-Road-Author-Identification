You&#039;re wanting to shift ~£78,000 a year, so asking a public forum where the wannabe launderers and Google searchers prowl isn&#039;t going to get you good results. There are 2 ways you can go about this in a better way. Firstly, you can pay somebody actually in the know and has real life experience of money laundering for advice or consultation. Or secondly, you can do your own research - but be warned that the internet is full of outdated misinformation and dangerously bad advice from people who done 10 minutes of search engine scouring, in a skill which takes months if not years just to get to grips with the standard toolkit of knowledge. When somebody gives you &quot;advice&quot; on money laundering - ask them questions like preferred business structure, the ideal country to set up in (Tip: If they say the Cayman Islands or Switzerland, they have no idea what they&#039;re talking about) if it is offshore, what the most efficient tax structuring methods are for the amounts being laundered, what are the main clearing houses you need to be aware of, has the FATF covered this in their past publications etc.<br /><br />The government will be more annoyed at you cheating them of their taxes and making them look dumb than you dealing drugs, that&#039;s a bedrock guarantee.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />im not wanting to launder huge amounts of cash man what i was meaning is i want to know ways to get large quantities of BC from SR into bank accounts and whats the best way to do this ect, or am i better just keeping it on the road and using that rather than using my own profit to buy stuff makes for a less suspicious way to buy stuff rather than bank transfers every couple of weeks..

Whenever possible, keep it in bitcoins and spend the bitcoins rather than use your bank where possible. But really, for large amounts, you will want to consider laundering it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />nah i dont need it for day to day stuff mate, i used launder in the wrong context my bad, i was meaning how to get the &quot;dirty money&quot; aka BC into banks ect without alarms being raised, i do transfers of around £2000 every few weeks, but the next few months thigns are gonna pick up lets say approx £3000 a fortnight now rather than every few weeks, i&#039;ve got other options rather than using my own bank but its gonna cost me a little cash. but better safe than sorry right? yeah if or when i become a vendor best bet is just to keep it on the road i think.
