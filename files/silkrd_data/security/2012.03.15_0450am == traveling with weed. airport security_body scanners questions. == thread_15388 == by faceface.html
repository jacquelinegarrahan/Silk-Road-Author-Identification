				Anyone RECENTLY travel with weed, or know the reliability of the body scanners to detect small amounts of weed if chosen to be scanned? <br /><br />I have the opportunity to travel this year, and I used to fly with quarters via the double drawers method. Flying domestically with weed was always a breeze, even if I was chosen to get patted down I always knew I&#039;d be good. <br /><br />However, that was several years ago, and the local airport I fly out of has recently upped their usage of the scanners and I&#039;m now a bit hesitant to fly with it. I heard that you have the option to opt out of the scan, and just get a manual pat down.

				oh yea definitely dont go through the body scanners with anything on you imo. It will clearly see everything, they tell you to make sure you have absolutely nothing in your pockets or anywhere on you... With TSA in the US I would say out the past eight to ten times I have been through airport security, at least four fifths or 80% of those were with body scanners. They generally dont even have the metal detectors operating anymore unless theyre backed up from what Ive seen. You may be able to opt out and get a pat down cause I have heard of that but I dont really know if they will acknowledge and permit your request. Kinda would be too late to back out and bail at that point. I have never carried any weed through tho... but wouldnt even try to carry a few pills through in my pocket with the scanners. <br /><br />I have heard of people grinding bud up and filling lots of large opaque gel caps then just placing in their carry on safely. Sure you can figure something else out. Good luck.

				I agree with microRNA.&nbsp; Just too risky now a days.&nbsp; I&#039;d figure out a stealth way to disguise it in my luggage (only if flying domestically).&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they would bother with drug dogs on domestic flights.&nbsp; Overseas is another matter.&nbsp; Where I live every flight from Amsterdam is checked by dogs.&nbsp; Your better off taking the train to Frankfurt Germany and then flying to my country.

				Buy weed from locals. Likely you&#039;ll pay a premium or maybe you won&#039;t find it at all.<br /><br />Don&#039;t travel with drugs. Not worth it. Too risky (depending on the airport). If you get caught, it&#039;s on your record forever. Not cool depending of your job.

				Erm... I travel all over the continental USA for business monthly and rarely do I travel without at least an eighth or a quarter of incredibly potent herbs in my possession. <br /><br />True: Don&#039;t walk through the security line with ANYTHING. NOTHING!!!<br /><br />False: Don&#039;t put weed in your suitcase! The dogs and the TSA will find it and you will be arrested for crime!<br /><br />Here&#039;s what you do: Your dope must be sealed in a vacuum sealed bag (if you don&#039;t have a vacuum sealer and you fuck with dope, you&#039;re not doing it right generally speaking). Take this vacuum sealed bag, and vacuum seal it again in another bag (why not?). Take this double sealed package of dope and wrap it in a sock roll or stuff it in a pants or jacket pocket. Check your luggage. <br /><br />Method 2: Follow vacuum seal method as stated previously. Purchase a speed-stick type deodorant (the kind that is the hard white soapbar-type) roll out the entire white deodorant part and separate it from the lower push cap thing. Remove the lower push cap and stuff the bag of dope inside, fit it around the center turnscrew. cut the white deodorant part so that only a little bit remains when you remove the cap, and give it a few rolls around your pits to give it the proper shape as if it had been used as normal. Put this in your toiletry bag in your suitcase as normal. <br /><br />Doing it this way I&#039;ve NEVER, EVER been fucked with at the airport or traveling anywhere. I have had friends who haphazardly put a shitty little sandwich bag of smelly weed in their luggage just loosely amongst their clothes and the most that has happened is the TSA confiscates it and leaves a threatening letter form letter in your luggage but they don&#039;t actually do anything about it. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				@Big Green, do you fly US Domestic with it in your check in? I was contemplating whether to pack it in my check in and double vac seal it and roll it in my socks or what not, but for some reason I still feel sketch as fuck about it.<br /><br />I used to travel extensively from the time I was an infant, to about 2009/2010, so I have more experience than the average citizen who travels once every 2 or 3 years if they&#039;re lucky. <br /><br />Traveling with weed, I&#039;ve always had a &#039;like a boss&#039; attitude about it, you either nut up or shut up. However, as I&#039;m growing older, that fiery spirit that I used to possess is now comparable to a nice bowl of green that&#039;s been cherried. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried the weed from the locals to where I&#039;m traveling to, and honestly $10 bucks is not worth the coughing fit and headache from the dirt they&#039;re trying to push off as kind bud.<br />

				A friend of mine travels weekly as a consultant and usually takes MJ with them.&nbsp; Two tips that I have been given:<br /><br />First, for the safe method - vacuum seal, place inside a gum pack (with some gum remaining) and place it in a pocket of your jeans/pants that are in your bags.&nbsp; Make sure the jeans are in the middle of bag and it will most likely not even show up on the scanner.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second, get some jell caps and mark them. Put the weed in, then put the jell caps in with other jell caps that have Valerian root in them.&nbsp; Put the Valerian Root bottle in your bags and go.&nbsp; The Valerian smell is so strong that a person won&#039;t pick up anything else.&nbsp; <br /><br />The second method seems riskier, but that is the method they use most times.&nbsp; Use at your own risk.

				Oh man, even the headline makes me wince! <br /><br />DO NOT DO IT! NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!<br /><br />One of the very few places that cops in the USA don&#039;t need a warrant or probable cause or reasonable suspicion to search you is at airports. They get to open your luggage and dig through it, they get to have you empty your pockets, they get to pat you down, they get to use multiple machines to see through stuff. Yes, this is for non-drug stuff, but if they stumble across drugs in the course of a legal non-drug search, you are boned. And unless you are flying from one in-state airport to another (rare but it happens. Texas and California mostly), you are crossing state lines as well as multiple county/city jurisdictions. Any of those places can choose to prosecute. <br /><br />Yes, I have seen the articles about how TSA is not supposed to report that stuff, but how much do you trust a badged federal employee to not wink, cough and then nod at your bag while standing in eyesight of a nearby badged local employee when he finds your weed in your checked luggage? I mean, really, is that where you want to put your trust? <br /><br />Want to be safe traveling with weed? Think a few days ahead, and do what the vendors on SR do. Make up some nice stealth packaging, a fake return address, and mail it to your real name at your destination (hotel, friend&#039;s house, etc) from a random mailbox. You will be as safe as anything else on SR, rather than taking a dozen individual in-person risks at both airports.

				I used to travel with weed ALL the time.....but then that damm underwear bomber tried to blow up the plane over Detroit and motha fucka changed everything.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m glad he burned his nuts off instead of blowing up the aircraft but now you really have to change your ways with those bodyscanners.&nbsp; Personally I would NEVER go through one whether I am holding or not.&nbsp; You can opt out.&nbsp; Heck you probably won&#039;t even have to go through one...they aren&#039;t used on every person and they certainly aren&#039;t mandatory.&nbsp; HOWEVER they will make you go through the old &quot;intensive pat down search&quot; so be careful there.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can&#039;t have weed on you and go through the scanner....You are asking to get busted.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would go along with Big Green&#039;s suggestions or just get it mailed.&nbsp; Crotching seems to risky these days....unless it&#039;s only a small amount of bud and you taped it tight under your balls.&nbsp; But that seems kinda uncomfortable.

				Used to crotch it before they rolled out the scanners in my local airport. I travel with herb so frequently now it&#039;s barely an afterthought. &quot;Coptcha&quot; I can see that you&#039;re a paranoid, fearful individual, and that&#039;s great, but it&#039;s marijuana. It&#039;s not cocaine or heroin or pills or mdma or anything like that. Some fucking wage slave digging through your soiled underthings is not going to look at a sock roll and see a few buds and alert the secret service and initiate a scene on the tarmac like The Running Man. They&#039;re going to take it and either toss it, keep it for themselves, or write it up in a log. Someone will shake their head and mutter &quot;damn hippie.&quot; If you&#039;re not a total space case FREAK you should be able to talk yourself out of a ticket or a delay if something does happen. Sometimes though by the reactions I see on this forum, some of you do not have the capability of reacting in a calm manner when approached by someone in a uniform. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to really go off on a tangent here, but the people who get jobs as TSA are pretty much what I refer to as &quot;entry-level&quot; people. I see a bunch of low-class people who look like they don&#039;t give a human fuck about anything but going home and trying to suffer through their own miserable minimum-wage problems. These people aren&#039;t grown in vats in a government lab. They&#039;re human beings and they are susceptible to the same kind of shit we all are as human beings. They can be manipulated, talked down, patronized and placated. Many of them may even possess empathy for other humans! So sometimes it&#039;s better to just suck it up and talk to someone and offer an apology for a mistake rather than embark on a path of belligerency and cause a scene because you watched a youtube video about not talking to anyone, ever.

				I have flown domestically with edibles many times without issue. I have literally had the security attendant searching my bag look at the bag of brownies when I forgot my nailclippers in my bag while I was super baked. Also, vials of honey oil can be pretty stealthy.

				so far a+ to big green :)<br /><br />that being said... there are a few other ways. <br /><br />don&#039;t keep it on you. you can refuse the scan, and can even refuse the pat down... you don&#039;t want to go through what happens after that. <br /><br />all that being said yeah you can keep it in your carry on and have it scanned through. make sure its double vacuum sealed and in nothing suspicious. if i were to put it on my carry on i would simply find several snack items (all sorts licorice works best) to disguise it with. vac seal these in the second seal, then triple seal them together with it. however if you are walking through security during a non busy period someone may spend a bit more time push/pulling your carry on through the scanner than usual. i typically stay away from carry on smuggling. <br /><br />a lot of folks may disagree with me but i always stick it in my checked luggage. i&#039;ve had success with small amounts (less than a gram or a bit over and depending on origin) without vacuum seal and large amounts with it. once again... large amounts? licorice has always been my friend. not because of the smell... but because of the fact that all sorts licorice tends be vacuum sealed quite often in checked luggage when people travel. people try to keep the smell and taste away from other items in there luggage so it&#039;s easily overlooked. now don&#039;t use this method for smuggling in half pounds or anything but less than an ounce and you&#039;re almost 100% good 2 go. just make sure you vacuum seal well and try to somewhat disguise the pot well between the packaging of the licorice. this obviously works better internationally. i&#039;ve been from the us to france, holland, belgium, and germany this way with no problems... domestic flights eh... there are easier ways. just remember the more you try to hide it the more suspicious you are. feel free to message me for more info. <br /><br />keep it simple... if it&#039;s a small amount and it&#039;s not reaking of skunky stench you should have no worries. your biggest threat is being randomly selected out of the crowd, it is then up to your ability to fool the security agents. this is another task on its own that is easily accomplished with a few &quot;motivators&quot;. try and get a doctor to rx you a small amount of benzos. remember... no one (not even tsa) wants to make too big of a scene. mild tourettes (no... don&#039;t start cursing at them), twitches, and grunts go a long way. even sweating isn&#039;t a problem. blame it on the medicine and show it to them with the the full bottle and rx label. tell them you are extremely nervous/anxious about the flight. <br /><br />if you can&#039;t picture yourself doing any of the above... think of some other ways that may work. if you go over those other ways in your head and you just don&#039;t see them panning out right. stop, leave your weed at home and do what everyone else says. mail it to yourself. it&#039;s a helluva love easier and i&#039;d be damned if it doesn&#039;t make for one pleasant flight :)<br /><br />

				Hot damn, I haven&#039;t checked this thread in a couple days and I gotta say thank you for all your suggestions. I had several coworkers who flew domestic recently out of the same airport I&#039;m using, and all of them including 75% of the other people all went through a body scanner.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, in my glory days I&#039;d walk through with quarters strapped and wouldn&#039;t break a sweat with those TSA fucks. @Big Green, I feel the same exact way about the TSA. They&#039;re all entry level employees just trying to make a dollar out of fifty cents. With the thousands of people who travel daily, and for many of the TSA employees, I&#039;m sure they have zero fucks to give to the average joe schmoe traveler. <br /><br />Anyway I&#039;ve talked to the hotel and told them the week I&#039;m going I will be expecting several work related packages and they said that they would hold it at the front desk.<br /><br />Just bought a vacuum sealer so I&#039;m just going to mail actual buds or just some hash or concentrates for better stealth.<br /><br />Thank you all who answered my question!<br />
