				So, I just went to make my first purchase of bitcoins, I bought them using Bitinstant and selected Moneygram as my method of payment and &quot;Send to email&quot; as the delivery method for the bitcoins. I went to my local duane reade and made the moneygram deposit ($35.95, $32+fees). Bitinstant uses Coinapult to deliver the coins by e-mail. I received a confirmation e-mail from Bitinstant stating &quot;order executed&quot; and giving me a coinapult url to collect my bitcoins. Upon clicking the coinapult url I was brought to my coinapult wallet, which showed a balance of zero bitcoins.<br /><br />I was at first not too perturbed and figured that they just needed some time to process the transaction, but several hours later, still, zero bitcoins. So I sent bitinstant and coinapult each a message alerting them to the situation, and started reading over everything on the coinapult website to figure out what&#039;s going on, which is when I noticed that their chart on the statistics page shows a dramatic drop in bitcoin transactions over the last 48 hours going all the way to zero and staying there for about the last 12 hours (if I&#039;m reading the graph correctly).<br /><br />Now, I used my regular personal e-mail account that I&#039;ve had for years, a gmail account, to receive the coins, so I&#039;m open to the idea that perhaps my e-mail was compromised and the coins were stolen from me. However, coinapult requires a PIN to send those bitcoins, and that pin is not anywhere in the e-mail records, it exists solely in my head. All my internet traffic is torified, and the only place i ever entered the PIN was when I filled out the form on Bitinstant.com ...<br /><br />Anyway, the chart on coinapults statistics page set off alarm bells in my head. And my $35.95 is gone, and I have no bitcoins. If it&#039;s simply because I failed to implement proper security measures (such as a secure email address or perhaps having Bitinstant send the coins directly to a bitcoin client on my computer instead of relying upon a third party) and the coins have just been stolen, I&#039;m ok with that, I&#039;ll get some more money together and try again. But I&#039;m mostly concerned that there&#039;s something wrong with coinapult and that&#039;s why my money&#039;s gone.<br /><br />I would have posted this on the Bitcoin forums but I&#039;m still a Newbie there and they don&#039;t allow Newbies to post so I figured I&#039;d post here. Anybody have any idea what happened? <br /><br />[edit]<br />Check it out:<br />http://coinapult.com/stats<br />it&#039;s plummeted directly to zero. What happened?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />[edit]<br /><br />I&#039;ve received a response from Bitinstant stating that<br /><br />...&quot;We buy Bitcoins at the best possible rate using any of 6 exchanges. There are a few things that can go wrong.&nbsp; <br />Rest assured your funds are safe! <br />Thanks for your patience&quot; ...<br /><br />But so far the Coinapult account remains at zero.<br /><br />[edit]<br /><br />Coins finally arrived in the Coinapult account. Not pleased with the overall experience, but at least they responded and resolved the situation.
