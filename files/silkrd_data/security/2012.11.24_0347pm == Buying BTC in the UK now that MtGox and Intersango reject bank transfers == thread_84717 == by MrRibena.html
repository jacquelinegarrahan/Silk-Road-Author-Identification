				I&#039;ve just tried to use both MtGox and Intersango using a direct bank transfer to fund my account, but both no longer accept UK bank transfers. I&#039;ve spent the last hour or so searching for a simple, safe and easy way to buy bitcoins.<br /><br />It seems as though a lot of people in the UK are recommending localbitcoin now but I&#039;d like to hear what other Brits are using. Please use this thread to post what you are using now and if you recommend localbitcoin please let me know!

				Im not from UK and never tried those other exchanges u mentioned, but Ive always used www.bitstamp.net that I think should work similarly? Very smooth, nice simple site and good helpful support aswell. I just send them a wire and include a &quot;message&quot; that is my Bitstamp account# and it funds my account so I can buy BTC there and send it to SR. Doesnt have to be my real name reg&#039;d to the account either, and I can have someone else to send the wire there if I want aslong as the &quot;message&quot; is included with the wire so they know to fund my account.<br />Also the graph on their mainpage to follow BTC fluctuation is nice<br /><br />edit: sorry maybe this wasn&#039;t of any help then:/&nbsp; &nbsp;and maybe it doesn&#039;t matter but I always sent them in Euro not USD. It seems SEPA transfer within EU is free, if that matters..&nbsp; again sorry not sure if any of this were of any help then,<br />hopefully someone from UK can give you better answers..

				I haven&#039;t bought any BTC yet (plan on doing it for the first time today)... but it seems &quot;Btc Faucet&quot; on localbitcoins.com is a good option, or BTCxUK: 64d7qoqgjcw47vvz.onion<br /><br />You can get in contact with them, state how much BTC you want or GBP you want to spend, and they&#039;ll get back to you with a price. I assume they then provide their bank details so you can do a bank transfer, and then receive the BTC into whatever address you gave to them.

I usually dont deposit more than like 100 pounds at a time with them tho just to minimise any potential risk, even if it means me going back to the bank a few times in the week to do it.

				I&#039;ve noticed Blockchain are allowing you to use Pingit in the UK (powered by Barclays) which gives you bitcoins instantly - it really is lightning fast. Only problem is the rate currently works out at about £8.30 per bitcoin when the UK rate on mtgox is £7.70 per bitcoin, so you pay about 8% in fees.

				Ive used both Pingit &gt; Blockchain, and Local Bitcoins. In both cases I had the BTC within hours. The Local BTC was anon as I paid cash into the sellers bank over the counter...... He also offered face to face cash transactions.<br /><br />Although they may cost that bit more, both are worth it. Happy buying&nbsp; ;D
