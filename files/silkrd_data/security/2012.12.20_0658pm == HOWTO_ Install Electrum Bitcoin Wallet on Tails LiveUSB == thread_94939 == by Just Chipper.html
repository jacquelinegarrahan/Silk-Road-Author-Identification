				Great Post dude! If I could give Karma I would.<br />Its been a while since your post so new ppls will need to change the Electrum file name to the curent release. <br />If you are using a persistant volume, then you dont need to reseed your wallet each time you log in. To make this work, BEFORE installing electrurm create a custom persistant directory called.. <br />/home/amnesia/.electrum<br />[Menu] Applications-&gt;System tools-&gt;Configure persistent volume<br />then resatart system and install electrum.<br />If you have already installed electrum, prior to creating your custom directory&nbsp; you will need to reseed your wallet just one more time.<br />also<br />Slush&#039;s electrum wall is really good. Much more reliable than the others.

				Oh and if you want a nice electrum icon to click to launch it, when editing the electrum.desktop file<br />also change the line....<br /><br />Icon=/home/amnesia/Persistent/Electrum-1.6.2/icons/electrum.png<br /><br />after saving the electrum.desktop&nbsp; file. Right-click on it. Select [Properties] → [Permissions Tab] → Execute: Check the box&nbsp; next to [Allow executing file as program] → [Close button]<br /><br />Now you have&nbsp; a pretty icon. You can move or copy this file anywhere and it will still work, but best to keep it somewhere in the persistent folder.<br />

				Great post, +1!<br /><br />However, I personally don&#039;t trust any wallet software, including electrum.<br />For maximum security and control, I use brainwallet.org.<br />I saved the web page (save page as) and run it on an offline computer<br />to generate my wallet addresses (private key and public key).<br />To send money, copy and paste the transaction history for the wallet address (from blockchain ot blockexplorer) on an online computer.<br />Save it to a CD or USB. Go to transaction on the offline computer, paste the history data into the transaction history form. Type in the destination wallet address, the amount, miner&#039;s fee (0.0005), and the page will generate a raw transaction text string. Copy and paste into txt file and burn on CD or copy to USB. Move the text to an online computer, and push the transaction through blockchain.info/pushtx (copy and paste). You can also use Bitcoin-QT to push the transaction if blockchain.info is not working or offline as it is now.<br />On Bitcoin-QT go to the Debug Window and type:<br /><br />sendrawtransaction &quot;raw transaction text string&quot; (without the quotes) and press ENTER. It will push the transaction to the network.<br /><br />Note: If you don&#039;t send the full amount in the wallet, some people say that the change you are supposed to receive goes out as a miner&#039;s fee when using brainwallet.org. I have not verified this as I&#039;ve always sent the full amount. Maybe someone can shine some light on this subject.<br />

				Really great thread, thanks a lot! Only because of you guys I could install electrum on my USB-hard drive&nbsp; :)<br /><br />But now I&#039;ve got a question about this! Can I receive bitcoins onto this wallet even when my computer is offline/shutdown? And there are 5 receiving addresses shown at the tab &quot;Receive&quot;, i guess all of them are mine, and i can use them only once and then I&#039;ll become a new one, is this correct? <br /><br />Anything else what I should know about electrum?

There is a whole subset of wallets that exist entirely offline and never touch the internet called Offline Wallets (Learn more at: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_set_up_a_secure_offline_savings_wallet ). People just need to send to the right address, and you can check the balance at http://blockchain.info or http://blockexplorer.com without having to open up your computer or bitcoin client.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t lose or forget the mnemonic code!! If somebody sent you coins to your address, and you lost access to the wallet and forgot your code, the coins would still be there but you wouldn&#039;t be able to spend them. You&#039;d know where they are, see the balance, but never be able to spend them, without access.<br /><br />Those 5 addresses you see in Electrum are all yours and you control all of them. You&#039;re not limited to 1 transaction per address, you could use an address as many times over as you want but it&#039;s not advised. It&#039;s better to make different addresses for different transactions, so that it is harder for peeping eyes to connect the dots. Electrum will make more addresses as needed. As you use addresses, the default settings will keep generating new addresses so that there are always 5 empty addresses available to use.

				Hi Just Chipper, first off this is a great guide. I&#039;ve been using Electrum on my Tails USB for about a month now with no issues. However today I went to open Electrum (version 1.7.3) and when I clicked on the &quot;Electrum Bitcoin Wallet&quot; icon (electrum.desktop) nothing happened - it just won&#039;t open. I&#039;ve tried restarting and even tried re-installing it but it still won&#039;t work. Any ideas on what the issue is?

				Made first use of my electrum wallet recently and worked smoothly!<br /><br />I do have a security question: Prior to depositing a large amount of BTC into my wallet in case something went wrong and they would be left floating in space, I deposited .01 BTC. The only place I had coins was my SR wallet leftover from a purchase, so I used those coins. I did not run the .01 coin thru a tumbler, I just sent it from SR to one of my 5 electrum addresses. After this test I bought my coins from a third party source and deposited them into my wallet and they arrived there just fine. I then used bitcoin fog to tumble all of the coins before sending them on to SR.<br /><br />Did I make a mistake in sending the .01 BTC to my wallet from SR to test that it would work? Should I scrap this wallet and install a new one or so long as I don&#039;t use the address I used to test depost, is there nothing to worry about? I just don&#039;t know if making the test deposit from SR is creating a link to the wallet from SR, I imagine it is. If there is a traceable link from SR to my wallet because of that test deposit, could there then also be a traceable link from SR to the electrum wallet to method of the deposits made with the other BTCs that I continue to deposit in through the third party source?<br /><br />thanks for any insight you can offer!

There are several Bitcoind operators who exclusively deny confirmations of services like Satoshi Dice, SR, and anything else they do not want to endorse. Now if you get several de-confirmations there&#039;s a good chance that you either have a misconfigured Bitcoind or are attempting a double-spend. This would cause all nodes to de-confirm your transaction. If you want to read more on the process you can find it in the Development and Technical section of Bitcointalk. Search for &quot;de-confirmation&quot; in that sub-forum.

				So just thinking out loud here. I noticed that the original Electrum Hidden Service (Slush&#039;s) has never came back up. Currently there is only one Electrum Hidden Service available (Stepkrav&#039;s). If this goes down it will force everyone to use a regular electrum server connection. <br /><br />What is everyone&#039;s interest in creating more Electrum Hidden Services so we don&#039;t have such a singular weak point in security? I can create one easily enough, just don&#039;t have the funds to keep one online 24/7. If anyone is willing to create one and keep it online I can help if needed. <br /><br />Anyone interested please feel free to respond here or via PM.

Click on it and input the new value in the server field. <br /><br />It&#039;s quite simply running a full Bitcoin node with Electrum Server installed. It will take a machine with 1 CPU, 2GB RAM, and 40GB HDD. The cost is however much a VPS costs monthly. Installing a Pruning Electrum Server on Debian Stable takes about 2 hours. The Blockchain Sync takes almost 24hrs through Tor though before the server is useable. Other than that there is virtually no maintenance. You basically let the server run and do regular maintenance once a month or so.

If I go into persistent folder and click on electrum 1.8 or whatever it is just brings me to page of files?<br /><br />Could anyone post a dumbies guide to using the wallet, also any advice on where to buy the coins in UK to send to the wallet?<br /><br />Thanks in advance and sorry if sound a bit dumb, with a bit of help in right direction should get the hang of it all and make my first SR purchase!

Blockchain is holding your coins the same way a bank does. If Blockchain goes down you cannot access your BTC without re-importing your private key into another wallet.

				JC&#039;s initial instructions said to boot Tails on the usb stick but i couldn&#039;t get it boot - went back to where i downloaded it and there was a tutorial there ( https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html ) and figured out tails is some sort of ubunntu software and it linked to another tutorial showing how to install it using windows, and indicating before it could be installed onto a usb stick it had to be installed on another stick or dvd - so i did<br /><br />after that last post, i turned the computer off and forgot the dvd in the tray - went to restart the computer and sun of a bmt, it booted in tails - go figure - <br /><br />i&#039;ll take a look at your link in the morning - this old brain of mine had a migraine after screwing with it for so long<br /><br />tks<br />

Once you use an address once Electrum will automatically generate a new address. This way you will always have 5 unused addresses. <br /><br />2) This is because you are trying to access those servers via TCP on port 50001, majority of the clearnet Electrum Servers have switched to SSL on port 50002. They are listed because they are the biggest default Electrum Servers.

This is one of the reasons we choose electrum.&nbsp; Its just not as fast or as clean as working with a backup of those files.<br /><br />To paint this by numbers...<br /><br />1. From the tails desktop open the folder “amnesia&#039;s Home” by double clicking on its icon.<br />2. In the&nbsp; File browser window which opens, chose the menu item [View]-&gt;Show Hidden Files<br />3. Look for the folder called “.electrum” it will only be there after you have installed and configured electrum.<br />4. Double click on the “.electrum” folder to open it<br />5. The files&nbsp; blockchain_headers &amp; electrum.dat will be in the folder.<br /><br />If you want to transfer it directly to another USB which has tails installed on it, you need to temporarily unlock and mount the volume of the 2nd USB.<br /><br />1. Insert the 2nd USB into a spare port<br />2. From the tails menu bar select [Applications]-&gt;[System tools]-&gt;[Disk Utility]<br />3. In the Disk Utility window, the left panel will show all your drives and USB&#039;s<br />4. Click on the 2nd USB drive in the left hand panel<br />5. It will show you the two partitions on the USB. Click on the [Encrypted] partition and click the “Unlock Volume” button.<br />6. Type in your passphrase (the one you use at login) and click unlock.<br />7. The USB drive will reveal its “TailsData” partition<br />8. Click on the “TailsData” partition and click the “Mount Volume” button<br />9. When you return to the file browser you will see the TailsData volume listed. Click on it<br />10. On the 2nd USB, you will find your electrum files in the folder [Home]-&gt;[amnesia]-&gt;[.electrum]<br />11. Copy your files across then return to the Disk Utility<br />12. Unmount the TailsData Volume and lock the encrypted volume.<br /><br />You can use this technique to copy directly between tails installations, but I tend to just copy it to a bakup folder on the 2nd USB because I cant trust myself not to copy over the wrong files.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />

You must complete the first steps in Tails 0.19 or older. Then you update to 0.20 before you install electrum. Tails 0.20 does not allow you to create custome persistent paths, this means it cannot save your electrum wallet info.

				Hmm after deleting those files i created a new wallet. It can&#039;t seem to connect though anymore, any idea why? I figure it&#039;s not a coincidence and all the servers suddenly went down but who knows. It begins syncing when i put a new url in then quickly goes back to being disconnected. <br /><br />Thanks for the help before and this thread in general, it&#039;s a huge help to the community

				So is tails the safest way to browse SR or what? i have tried reading through all the tails documentation but really only gathered from it that your isp can tell your using tor and possibly tails but now what you are viewing on tor.<br /><br />Having said that is that a bad thing? what countries is using tor considered suspicous or not advised?<br /><br />Alsp VPN??? i have heard stuff about VPN but it has me mighty confused, should tails users be using VPN as well to maintain compete security and hide the fact your using tor?<br /><br />I also seen that in the startup screen of tails it mentions your not connected to a VPN or is it VPM?<br />I don&#039;t know but it makes it sound as if the developers wanted you to use this feature?<br /><br />If anyone could point me in the right direction of using VPN with tails or VPM (whichever one it is) or if i even should be trying to achieve this i would be greatly thankfull.
