				It seems to me that not just Tormail is down, but numerous other sites that are likely to be hosted with freedom hosting are down, in addition to the actual freedom hosting site being down.<br /><br />Is there any other explanation for both FH, Tormail, hackbb, and all manner of other services being down all at once without warning? <br />:( I hope it wasn&#039;t a bust and that theyre just having server difficulties. Thankful the road isn&#039;t hosted there!

				I accidentally double posted and they decided to be arseholes. :)<br /><br />In any case, FH has a maintenance page up now. So either,<br /><br />1) Freedom Hosting went offline because of a technical failure<br /><br />2) The FH server was seized and/or admin was arrested and decided to cooperate in running a honeypot, or LE is setting up a honeypot without him.

				Soo,<br /><br />What&#039;s going on? Is it true that the nazis got the owner of freedom hosting? Is freedom hosting now being run by the nazis? <br /><br />How did they get the owner of freedom hosting (assuming they did)?<br /><br />If they can get the owner of freedom hosting, what about the owner of silk road?<br /><br />It&#039;s weird that this topic isn&#039;t being hotly discussed?
