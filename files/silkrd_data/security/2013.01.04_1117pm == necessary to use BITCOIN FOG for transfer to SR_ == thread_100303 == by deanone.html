				It&#039;s not necessary.&nbsp; SilkRoad tumbles the coins before they hit your account anyway.

				The honest answer to your question is that nobody knows for sure. Academic researchers (notably Adi Shamir, the S in RSA) have performed statistical analyses of the block chain and found various links, but nobody has been prosecuted by being linked to a crime through bitcoin transactions. It&#039;s almost certain that will happen eventually, but we don&#039;t know what LE capabilities are now or will be in the future, and how willing they will be to deploy those capabilities on criminals of varying stature. A terrorist or cartel boss has more reason to be worried than an SR vendor, who has more reason to be worried than a buyer.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that all transactions are saved in the block chain forever. 20 years from now, when LE has 10^20 greater computing power, those transactions will be available for analysis. I think it&#039;s worth paying a 3% fee for added security.

				A small time, occasional buyer purchasing btc via cash deposit should be fine sending the coins directly to SR, assuming of course that you never used your real information in any part of the process. Use a new alias every time, including emails, and don&#039;t access the btc sites from anything that can be traced back to you. Also, I advise getting a new btc deposit address from SR every time.

				I don&#039;t think it is wise if they are coming straight from an exchange that has your personal info, such as Mt. Gox. Blockchain.info provides a mixing service that does exactly what bitcoin fog does for cheaper. (https://blockchain.info/wallet/send-anonymously)<br /><br />But, covering your trail will never hurt.
