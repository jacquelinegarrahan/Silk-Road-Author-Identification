				Any thoughts/suggestions on an offsite (away from primary residence) storage site?&nbsp; Im not talking massive quantities of anything (like a couple g&#039;s over personal use amounts) if one was to order a little larger to stock up. Opinions are appreciated.<br /><br />a) Safe deposit box - Do you need to provide tons of info to open?&nbsp; LE could probably get a warrant quick and see this along with your account numbers though.<br /><br />b) Renting a locker from a storage facility - probably expensive and not worth it for small amounts.&nbsp; <br /><br />c) dont stockpile and order a single night at a time&nbsp; :P<br /><br />

				those long term small lockers at like train stations and similar places, not a great place depending if dogs regularly search stations but over here it would be pretty safe.

				I was thinking about this the other day, the best solution I could come up with is a trusted friend. I have many that I can count on, that I trust ENTIRELY, I don&#039;t know if that would work for you though. I would like to hear what others are doing.

				A friend can work, but it isn&#039;t ideal.&nbsp; You may trust them now, but stuff happens IRL, and it&#039;s better to just not have them in the equation at all.&nbsp; You also can only access your stuff when they are available.<br /><br />I would suggest something off site that is always available.&nbsp; When selecting a site, here are some things to keep in mind:<br />-You want something nearby, so you don&#039;t have to travel too far to get it<br />-It should not be regularly travelled by anyone.&nbsp; You want something out of the way that nobody sees<br />-It should be well hidden.&nbsp; Even if someone is in the area (which they shouldn&#039;t be), they shouldn&#039;t be able to see it, even if they are 5 feet away<br />-You should be able to access the area and the stash without arousing suspicion.&nbsp; This might mean only going at night, when nobody is around to see you<br /><br />I&#039;ll give an example of one such place.&nbsp; Do you have any freeways near you?&nbsp; How about an onramp - the kind that does a full 270 degree turn before getting on the freeway.&nbsp; If it has trees around the edges, this is perfect.&nbsp; Park near the onramp, and walk onto the ramp, finding a good place to stash it.&nbsp; The place never gets pedestrians, and it&#039;s off site.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just keep your eye out in your day to day life for areas that are fenced off.&nbsp; You&#039;d be amazed by the sheer abundance of them.
