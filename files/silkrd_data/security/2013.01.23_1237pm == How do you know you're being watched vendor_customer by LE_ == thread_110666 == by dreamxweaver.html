				I have been wondering about this for some time now. Users report knowing when a vendor did not ship and send their info to LE instead. Vendors report they are being watched and that some of their clients are LE or have been in contact with them.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t been on SR myself for a while for a while. After hearing some scary stuff about SR irl I decided it was a wise decision I made.<br /><br />Is there a list of topics to read about this?<br />Is it true that there are teams that can be hired to make fake reviews, flame a vendor and let them give out negative karma? Or are there vendors out there that do this themselves with the so called dummy accounts and new to SR and trusted vendor/buyer accounts to do dirty work?<br /><br />I did experience vendors remembering an aweful lot about stuff that was in the past. So they must have saved some things and there is not way to know if that is saved very secure or not secure at all. Which means a lot to perhaps no shit if the vendor gets caught. <br />Are there these &quot;analysers&quot; to hire to get information from sources, or with tactics that most people do not know about to analyse under how much risk they are? I heard this goes pretty deep, like what vendor or what buyer is under LE surveillance and even which actions are going to be taken/have been taken. Even some really creepy stuff that LE busted people and that there is a &quot;no-return&quot; list of vendors that got taken in and have been killed.<br /><br />Can they, for example, take a picture that a vendor took from a random site after being contacted by customers to hear about legitimacy and them being so stupid as to provide vendor info, stamp location and even ways of packaging?<br /><br />Does LE have to contact you, or do they not always do that and can you then hire people or ask around those &quot;elite analyzing&quot; teams which have secret bonds with eachother and people inside LE that leak out info to the others in those teams?<br /><br />What would be good/required things to do if you know, or think you are being watched? At what point do you take which actions?<br /><br />I hope a lot is conspiracy. Otherwise I have ten million more reasons why getting it from friends or even on the streets is a lot saver and cheaper. No problems here in NL ;)<br /><br />Since I&#039;m from NL I&#039;d like to know specifically about the ins and outs of what is and isn&#039;t possible regarding LE?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I struggle to see how you could suggest buying drugs off the streets or from friends is even slightly safer than buying from a website on the Hidden Web, considering one is completely anonymous if done correctly as compared to the potential of being caught in possession with the drugs either whilst making the purchase or driving home with them. Most of the answers you seek to the questions you pose are unknown to any of us, unless your in LE. All we can do is control our own actions and the decisions we make. It&#039;s important to keep educating yourself on how to remain anonymous and access/use SR from a secure set-up. Minimizing your risks in everything you do is what you can control. If LE are planning to arrest you, there is not much you can do. Once your anonymity is compromised and you&#039;ve been identified by LE, you&#039;re in deep trouble. This is why the best security tactic you can use to keep yourself safe is to maintain your Anonymity. Encrypted HDD&#039;s and USB sticks, using PGP, etc, etc are all pointless if LE has identified you and are monitoring your activities. There are basic principals one has to follow to give themselves every chance of staying safe. Things such as using common sense, think twice before you act, make sensible decisions your comfortable with, be cautious with the information you give to a vendor (always Encrypted with PGP) or post on the forum, your choice of vendor, the delivery address you use , the quantity of each order you make, etc, etc. Truth be known, you won&#039;t know for sure your being watched until the day your caught and arrested. People may think they are being watched but that could be partly due to some paranoia we have all experienced at times.

				When I buy drugs from the city I live in, I catch trains buses etc at least I won&#039;t have the chance of getting pulled over :) May sound stupid but I like it. And someone else driving is good sometimes haha

				You can also send yourself a harmless package.&nbsp; Wrap it in such a way that you would know it had been opened (a bunch of tape around todays paper.&nbsp; They would have to rip the tape to get through the newspaper wrapped around your harmless object.&nbsp; If they were watching you, they would intercept the package and look at it first.&nbsp; Since it is harmless, no harm in them looking.&nbsp; If they open your package you would know immediately upon receiving it. <br />

				Send yourself a bag of salt or something powdered. Wrap the package in such a way that you would know if it had been tampered with. See how long it takes to get to you and make a judgement.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I feel that thinking out your actions and weighing up possible out comes is a good prevention technique. For example if a vendor says they don&#039;t use PGP, you have to decide if the risk is worth the rewards or if you could be putting yourself at risk.<br /><br />Try to obtain your BTC as anonymous as possible. I used to use a Bitcoin vendor called Vlad1m1r before he fucked everyone over. I&#039;ve only just returned :P Thats an important prevention technique there. If you have no trace of BTC transactions the police have less evidence to fuck you with. It&#039;s what can save your ass if they actually do take you in. They wont be able to prove anything without a trace of money being traded for these strange packages that keep being sent to your door ;) ANYONE CAN SEND ANYTHING. <br /><br />I think using a Live version of a security distro is a good move also.<br /><br />Something I head people doing too, if you want to anonymize that BTC even further, is route their bitcoin wallet through TOR so it appears the money has been sent from another country. <br /><br />My last bit of advice is... don&#039;t keep that tinfoil hat on too long. It can damage hair folicles ;)
