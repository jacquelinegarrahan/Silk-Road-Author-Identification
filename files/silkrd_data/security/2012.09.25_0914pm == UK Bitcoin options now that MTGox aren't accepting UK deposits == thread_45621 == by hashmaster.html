				I just started a thread same time as you, im thinking of transfering to their EUR bank account in poland but need to find a bank that does international transfers for free or cheap...&nbsp; My bank charges £27 !!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The account is based in poland and they usually charge 10 pln per transfer which is about £2..

				Yeah, me and a mate have had the same problem today.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing the 300 transaction (deposits) limit has been reached, and then Barclays put a block on the account.&nbsp; I&#039;m considering trying after midnight to see if the 300 daily transaction limit has been reset and then it will allow GBP transfer. I hope so.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not working later, then I&#039;m presuming this block on that a/c and sort code is permanent or at least semi-permanent.&nbsp; Going the same way as Intersango....<br /><br />The way I see it, there are two possible reasons for this. <br /><br />1.) The type of account that Mt.Gox have with Barclays is not a proper business account, and therefore they&#039;re not paying fee&#039;s on money being deposited into the account. This might explain why Barclays have restricted them, and are trying to make them switch to a business account where they have to pay fees, and would then no doubt have to pass them onto people like us.<br /><br />2.) The establishment are cracking down on Bitcoins.&nbsp; It&#039;s fair to say they don&#039;t like this free-market currency as THEY don&#039;t have any control over it, and therefore can&#039;t impose fees or follow the money. Also, it must be very difficult to attack the SR as it&#039;s concealed on the Tor network, but it&#039;s far easier to attack the way people get their bcs, by making things difficult for the Bitcoin-exchange websites.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used to get my coins from Intersango, but they had a similar problem and are no longer able to accept UK bank transfers.<br /><br />The crazy thing is, who ever heard of a bank that didn&#039;t accept money!!??&nbsp; This is a big concern for all of us.&nbsp; I would say something is going down behind the scenes and this is part of an orchestrated plan by the establishment.<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good BTC exchange which allows GBP bank transfers?<br /><br />In response to Orinoko Flow, I also looked at transferring to Mt.Gox Japanese bank, but you get charged 2.5% of the amount, plus a 1,000 yen ($12) receiving fee, PLUS whatever fee your UK bank is charging for the international transfer.&nbsp; Starts to get a bit silly at this point...<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />PTF

				I also tried to transfer funds to MTGox today online, only to have a popup telling me the account number was incorrect (Which it wasn&#039;t).<br /><br />So at lunch I popped to my local bank and again attempted the same transaction, the lady in the bank who I know quite well from going in, told me that the account could not be credited because the account status was closed. <br />She turned the monitor around to show me as well...<br /><br />Hopefully they or intersango sort something out soon, I don&#039;t really know of any other options.<br /><br />: (

				I have contacted mtgox support as I£136 that&#039;s floating around somewhere and they are going to find the transactions after they received their Sept statement from barclays. Furthermore they also said &quot;we are working towards a solution to this temporary suspension of UK deposits with Barclays or another UK/ EU bank&quot;. So it is a headache but all is not lost, MTgox are the longest running btc exchange. In the mean time if the charges involved for international transfers aren&#039;t cost effective, I personally am looking&nbsp; into okpay account to deposit to my mtgox account through there, although I need to do more research. There is always more than one way to skin a rabbit!!<br />

				The international transfers via online banking aren&#039;t too expensive IF you&#039;re sending a decent about of cash.&nbsp; £10 flat rate with most banks.&nbsp; I did one to Intersangos Euro account and it took 3 hours and I had the funds.&nbsp; Took 10 mins to do online.&nbsp; &nbsp;All up, quicker than the old GBP deposit.<br /><br />I reckon I paid about 5% more overall for my BTC.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m also looking into other methods, but this seems the best for now, especially if you get a few friends to chip in so you&#039;ve got a few hundred quid to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />PTF
