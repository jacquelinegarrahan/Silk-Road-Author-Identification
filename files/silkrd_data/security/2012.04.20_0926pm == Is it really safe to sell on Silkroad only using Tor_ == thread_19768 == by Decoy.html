				Hey guys,<br /><br />I just started to sell over here and i never though in my mind that i would sell that much, it kind of took over my everyday job ! I want to keep selling but at the same time im worried about if i can get caught by ip or any other way. Do any of you guys have any tips so i know how to keep my ass safe?&nbsp; Please let me know thanks<br /><br /><br />Respect to all our buyers !

				TOR is generally safe, they won&#039;t locate you by the IP-address. Higher chance of doing that by the potential fingerprints you might leave with handling the financial side of the venture (exchanges, constant $ flow of unusual origin into your own bank account, etc) or the physical shipment part. I checked out your profile on SR and I can see that you are assumably using PGP - which is good, I would enforce that as a rule if someone wants to contact you (definitely for shipping addresses). I would also, probably, purchase a VPS or even a dedicated server from some reputable company (i.e. LeaseWeb or OVH) and store all of my &#039;SR activity&#039;-related stuff over there, on an encrypted partition (which would be even more win if you had an AES-NI capable CPU, that would prevent cold-boot attacks on RAM with TRESOR compared to regular dm-crypt/LUKS encryption, that is if all things come to worst and they attempt such an extreme operation as extracting your encryption key [very unlikely, but might occur in the lowest percentage of cases, if you really pissed them off, but usually a lot more relevant to cyber crimes, instead]). Of course, accessing it with either SSH or SFTP. Basically, I would store jack shit on my own HDD. I would probably even buy an SSD, something like 60G, that is if I wanted to temporarily download/upload something from my local storage to the rented server - because then you could use, i.e., &quot;sdelete&quot;, that would zap the unallocated space much, much more quickly (after file deletion) than on the HDD: forensics wouldn&#039;t be able to do much with such drive, if all unused sectors have been overwritten with zeroes. Um, in the most bizarre cases your ISP might be doing DPI (deep packet inspection) on your end, meaning, they will be able to tell you&#039;re constantly using TOR (even though they wouldn&#039;t be able to sniff the traffic, because it&#039;s encrypted) - but yeah, that could raise some eyebrows in the long run, but really, I can&#039;t see this happening UNLESS you are already a suspect and the LE is working to gather as much evidence as possible (just another minor confirmation of justifying a potential house raid). Even though if you just used SSH for the remote server and TOR over there - that could minimize the effects of such suspicion.

				As I&#039;m only a buyer atm I only use Tor myself, and I&#039;m otherwise not too worried.<br /><br />I can suggest a few things I would make certain to do if I started to sell on the road:<br /><br />1. Tails: This is an operating system that can be booted on a usb drive or a CD. Tails doesn&#039;t use your HDD to store any memory, but rather your RAM to store everything. Because of this, when you shut down your computer, all the activity that you did while using Tails is permanently destroyed and impossible tor recover. I wouldn&#039;t sell without this!<br /><br />2. Financial Security: Be careful when converting large amounts of money from bitcoin to cash. If you are receiving lots of income to any traceable account that is under your name, this is a red flag for LE and financial institutions that illegal income is being attained. Make sure you read up on any information you can about withddrawing your cash, because this is one of the most important considerations for your security.<br /><br />3. There is a shitload more things to consider, but these are what I find to be the 2 most important things aside from proper packing/shipping techniques.<br /><br />Welcome to the Road!&nbsp; :D

				If you are a vendor I would expect that you would be using a VPN service that doesn&#039;t keep any logs. VPN&#039;s are cheap, even for a triple encrypted connection.

				Don&#039;t use VPNs, use JonDonym instead over wifi or something.<br />SSD&#039;s are notorious for not encrypting properly. You have to first encrypt everything, then add your secret files. If you don&#039;t, everything can be accessed that was on that SSD

There are these anonymous IBAN-bank cards (offered on SR, but you can get them cheaper in other places), which you can use to cash out up to €2500 (or $3000, I believe). Make sure you don&#039;t use them too close to your home and wear a motorbike helmet while using the ATM, this will greatly reduce the chances of you being caught.

				Hmm, Is it definitely safe to use TOR on one of these? I am not a techie unfortunately, but couldnt LE could possibly locate which cell you are on fairly quickly, then triangulate your position the same way that google maps on the iphone does it (location services)?&nbsp; Actually, the more I think about it, who the fuck would even use it over a mobile connection? Stick out like tits on a bull i expect. How do you know what technology they are using in those 3g towers? I expect every criminal out there has at one time come up with the idea of using payg anonymous phones, and we all know how phones can track your movement very effectivly from cell to cell.

I suggest wearing a larger than normal pair of dark sunglasses, a hat/cap and long sleeves. I don&#039;t like hoodies, but they work too. Also, you never wear this stuff normally obviously. Halloween is a nice time of year for extracting a lot of moolah I think you&#039;ll find.<br /><br />Also; do your transactions at say 23:50, and then you&#039;ll be able to use up two day&#039;s allowance of withdrawals within a few minutes, which is always a nice thing.<br /><br />However having said that, you must always be thinking about the ATM&#039;s software searching for suspect activity. For God&#039;s sake don&#039;t just get a pile of cards and use them at the same ATM everytime! Ideally obtain a rental with cash and drive to the next city and motor about from random ATM to random ATM if you&#039;ve a lot of cards. Different amounts each time too. And by random, I mean random. As in you pick up the geographical locations of several dozen ATMs and then use an online random generator to regurgitate them back at you in a random order. If you&#039;re really paranoid, or have a hell of a lot of moolah to extract, think about obtaining a number plate to swop out.<br /><br />But ultimately, this method is only good for trivial amounts of capital. After this it gets tricky!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry, but I had to laugh at this one. No offense but if you are going to go to that much trouble to use an ATM, you mite as well use the default password to access the admin section and redefine the slot with $20 bills as a $5 slot and disable all other bill slots. Then withdraw $75. The machine spits out 15x $20 bills and you have gotten your money plus.<br /><br />There are easier ways to get bit coins out to USD. Hell, start a website offering Web development/consulting services at $125 an hour.(The going rate where I am) Pay your bitcoin into your website from different wallets. Do invoices for each payment and maintain accounting, Sell your bitcoin on an exchange and deposit it into your account. Remember to claim it on your taxes as well as all your business expenses. It is not out of the ordinary for Web development/Consulting services to bring in 150k a year. Heck I know of a few that are making 1.5m a year with 3 employees. You can push a lot through that simple setup and as long as you pay the IRS there cut, all is golden.<br /><br />

I&#039;d rather use a VM running of an encrypted hidden True Crypt partition. I would however use an anonymously bought VPS to conceal my traffic. I&#039;d set up an SSH-tunnel to the VPS and use Tor through that tunnel, so only the VPS is showing Tor traffic (your connection would show a lot of SSH traffic, but that won&#039;t be a big give away as a lot of Tor traffic).<br /><br />Overall you can hide much of the technical stuff. The fact that everything is running through Tor already helps a lot in keeping you safe. I&#039;d be more worried about leaving a paper trail on the financial side of business. Cashing out through your bank account (exchange -&gt; bank account) would be fine for small amounts, but at some point you&#039;ll have to cash out another way. There are these anonymous IBAN-bank cards (offered on SR, but you can get them cheaper in other places), which you can use to cash out up to €2500 (or $3000, I believe). Make sure you don&#039;t use them too close to your home and wear a motorbike helmet while using the ATM, this will greatly reduce the chances of you being caught.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wouldn&#039;t trust a &quot;an encrypted hidden TrueCrypt partition&quot; for the world with my data. As I have already pointed out in my post - TRESOR is the way to go, not TrueCrypt. TrueCrypt is an inferior way of encrypting partitions/volumes, as it&#039;s subject to cold-boot attacks on RAM: that&#039;s where it stores the encryption key for mounted partitions - otherwise, it wouldn&#039;t be able to decrypt and supply the contents of that storage on-the-fly. The authorities are now using small SSD-USB/ATA controllers, that are able to boot on the target PC and dump the encryption key out of RAM in seconds, which will almost always yield positive results (due to the way that DRAM contents degrade gradually when not refreshed, not instantly and it&#039;s also possible to freeze the modules in order to achieve a higher retention time - this technique is now widespread for particular US LE).<br /><br />Refer to this research: https://citp.princeton.edu/research/memory/<br />And this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack<br /><br />The solution is to keep the encryption key inside the CPU registers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRESOR<br />If you do not have AES-NI support - even an SSE2 enabled CPU will be sufficient, although with some percentage of performance penalty.<br /><br />Yes, I know that you&#039;ve said a &quot;hidden&quot; partition - however, once the relevant encryption key is obtained for the according partition, then proper forensics will have no problem identifying the masqueraded storage in question. Using a VM adds nothing more to the equation, unless you are using VM encryption as well, like VMware encryption i.e. - also crackable. Although setting up a VM might be more comforting, because you&#039;d have more options for multiple network configurations (virtual adapters, etc). But nothing that you can&#039;t do on a remote dedicated server.<br /><br />Acquiring an anonymously bought VPS/dedicated is also not that hard, because one can use a prepaid card (http://www.plati.ru/asp/list_pin.asp?id_f=11354).<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;d set up an SSH-tunnel to the VPS and use Tor through that tunnel, so only the VPS is showing Tor traffic (your connection would show a lot of SSH traffic, but that won&#039;t be a big give away as a lot of Tor traffic).&quot; - isn&#039;t that exactly what I said, though? Except that I didn&#039;t explicitly mention tunneling the traffic, but that was implied: tunneling the port through something like &#039;Tunnelier&#039; or port-forwarding in Putty and solely usinig the preconfigured portable version of FireFox supplied with the TOR bundle (not running TOR on your machine, but just the FF instance).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Excellent advice 0x00!!! Thanks for echoing the points about using a VPS/SSH tunnel to mask tor traffic, and good info all around regarding truecrypt, particularly hidden OSs. Depending on where you live, they can just look at file access dates and various OS log entries and basically &quot;prove&quot; that the outer OS is likely a decoy for a hidden system partition. <br /><br />The &quot;RAM free&quot; encryption solutions are obviously the way to go as far as mass storage is concerned. About how difficult is to purchase and implement TRESOR-capable CPUs today? I haven&#039;t look into those in a little while.

Higher chance of doing that by the potential fingerprints you might leave with handling the financial side of the venture (exchanges, constant $ flow of unusual origin into your own bank account, etc) or the physical shipment part. I checked out your profile on SR and I can see that you are assumably using PGP - which is good, I would enforce that as a rule if someone wants to contact you (definitely for shipping addresses). I would also, probably, purchase a VPS or even a dedicated server from some reputable company (i.e. LeaseWeb or OVH) and store all of my &#039;SR activity&#039;-related stuff over there, on an encrypted partition (which would be even more win if you had an AES-NI capable CPU, that would prevent cold-boot attacks on RAM with TRESOR compared to regular dm-crypt/LUKS encryption, that is if all things come to worst and they attempt such an extreme operation as extracting your encryption key [very unlikely, but might occur in the lowest percentage of cases, if you really pissed them off, but usually a lot more relevant to cyber crimes, instead]). Of course, accessing it with either SSH or SFTP. Basically, I would store jack shit on my own HDD. I would probably even buy an SSD, something like 60G, that is if I wanted to temporarily download/upload something from my local storage to the rented server - because then you could use, i.e., &quot;sdelete&quot;, that would zap the unallocated space much, much more quickly (after file deletion) than on the HDD: forensics wouldn&#039;t be able to do much with such drive, if all unused sectors have been overwritten with zeroes. Um, in the most bizarre cases your ISP might be doing DPI (deep packet inspection) on your end, meaning, they will be able to tell you&#039;re constantly using TOR (even though they wouldn&#039;t be able to sniff the traffic, because it&#039;s encrypted) - but yeah, that could raise some eyebrows in the long run, but really, I can&#039;t see this happening UNLESS you are already a suspect and the LE is working to gather as much evidence as possible (just another minor confirmation of justifying a potential house raid). Even though if you just used SSH for the remote server and TOR over there - that could minimize the effects of such suspicion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br /><br />very accurate and good anti detection advice!

This is a recipe for failure. The penalties for selling drugs are extremely harsh even when compared with violent crimes and even sex crimes. Your more likely to get a harsh sentence for trafficking cocaine for the first time then rape, its fucked up but the entire justice system is fucked up. Honestly, I strongly suggest that you sit down, think about what your doing, then think about the consequences. Its absolutely essential to think about and even plan for the worst case scenario before it happens when conducting illegal business. In fact the only way to operate smartly is to constantly think about what could happen if you fuck up and always work hard so that you dont fuck up. The worst thing you can do is start selling drugs or doing other illegal shit in the hopes of just wingin it with no real plans or an intelligent course of action.
