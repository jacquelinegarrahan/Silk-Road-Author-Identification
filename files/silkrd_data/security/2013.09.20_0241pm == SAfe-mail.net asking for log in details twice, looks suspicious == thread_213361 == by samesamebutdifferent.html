				So when Tormail got taken down by the feds I wasn&#039;t in much of a rush to set up another email account but with the recent botnet causing connectivity issues I looked into my options again and created a safe mail account. <br /><br />Was working just fine until just now, when I try to log in I am directed to another log in page asking for my credentials again that looks a bit like safe mail but not enough to make me confident I am still on the safe mail site.<br /><br />Anyone else experience this? <br /><br />I&#039;ve not entered my credentials again to see what happens, would rather just abandon the service if its looking a bit dodgy.

				Safe-Mail is hosted in Israel, which has a liberal intelligence sharing agreement with the US, which is part of the Five Eyes along with Australia. So they all share a lot of intel with each other. I&#039;d stay away from Safe-Mail, because even if you PGP encrypt every message, your metadata is not safe. Find a clearnet provider in Russia, South America or Asia. The less friendly the country is with the Five Eyes countries, the better.<br /><br />The web site doesn&#039;t have to be in English. Pop the text into a translation service to figure out what you&#039;re doing long enough to get a desktop email client set up. Configure Thunderbird + Enigmail + Torbirdy to work with the email provider&#039;s POP/SMTP settings. And obviously PGP encrypt all messages. Enignmail integrates PGP into Thunderbird, Torbirdy configures it to route traffic over Tor and adds other anonymity features like changing your time zone to GMT and scrubbing email headers.<br /><br />This is the best way to use clearnet email, imo. It avoids the need to visit a web site and turn on Javascript.<br />

				what exactly are you trying to protect against? if for drug stuff, then who cares what is written, nobody is going to write personal info to their drug dealer. let the feds read your shit, doesnt do them any good. also pgp only works if the other party uses it, fyi most people dont and wont.

Unless you have a PO box with a fake name, that&#039;s pretty personal, but even in the case of a PO box, you wouldn&#039;t want the feds to know where to intercept your package.<br /><br />Also, a sentence like this,<br /><br />&quot;I sent the payment.

				go under settings preferences tab and click on reduce IP checks<br />also there is a option to use faster no-script html version.enable it<br /><br />it will work fine on tor sometimes it will ask to sign in again as tor IP changes<br /><br />safe-mail is hosted in israel and is relatively safer than gmail, yahoo,et al<br /><br />i know someone involved in sensitive imports using it for 5 years and he finds it safer than gmail..never caused him problem<br /><br />though safe-mail is hosted in Israel....it depends on service provider to honour LE thugs request<br /><br />best option is to use a email service provider based in russia/ cis/ china/ venezuela/ cuba...lol basically your axis of evil thing....but still if you a bigshot big bros can watch you...use these email providers and use Tor and PGP...also do not discuss your own personal info in any email<br /><br />zimmerman said it right when he stopped Silent Circle email service..that its almost impossible to secure email data....<br /><br />its irony that that so called axis of evil countries are better at protecting info than US
