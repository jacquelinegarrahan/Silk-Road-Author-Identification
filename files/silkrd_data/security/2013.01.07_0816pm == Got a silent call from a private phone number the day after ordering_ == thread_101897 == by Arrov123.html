				After ordering a shipment, I got a silent phone call from a private number. Should I be worried? Is there any chance this is a sting operation? I&#039;ve never gotten such calls before. The seller was not very established on the road- not a new one, but not one of the top listings.

				Is it common to get silent calls from private numbers? I can&#039;t think why anyone would waste their time doing this to people, unless they are police trying to find if someone lives at the address in question.

				Private/unlisted numbers are very common with telemarketers and their phone systems are often computer-operated - they dial lots of different numbers and when somebody picks up and says &quot;hello&quot; the computer patches the call through to a live person (who is sometimes in a federal prison). Collection agencies also use this kind of system. Sometimes no one answers even after you say hello because when the computer patches the call through to their extension, they&#039;re away taking a shit or getting raped in the shower.<br /><br />Getting private number calls is common dude - common and random. Ignore it. If a cop wanted to fuck with you he&#039;d call from the po-po station so that would be on the caller ID and you&#039;d really sketch the fuck out!

				You do realize that telemarketing companies do this to find out the best time of day to get ahold of you? Most of the people I know actually have received on of these types of calls at least 1 time in their lifetime. This is most likely the case, and you are just overly paranoid about the situation. I can assure you that what happened was just a coincidence and you are surely overreacting to this. The DEA would NOT call your phone from a private number if they were trying to setup a sting on you, lol. If the police were trying to contact you they would not hide their number.

				I always give vendors I order from my phone number so they can give me a quick buzz letting me know the package is on it&#039;s way, it helps build trust and as I usually order bulk it lets vendors know I mean business.<br /><br />But a silent phone call is really bad news man, most likely your shipment is being watched, you&#039;re under surveillance and the feds are closing in fast, laughing amongst themselves as they prepare to throw your rape-friendly ass in a cell.<br /><br />You need to stock up on guns ASAP and destroy all the evidence by burning your house to the ground before heading into the woods for at least the next year. I&#039;m serious, grab some petrol, pour it on everything in site and light it up just before you leave. If anyone tries to stop you don&#039;t hesitate to shoot them, they are out to get you! If you want to survive you will do this now bro, no fucking around. Do you want to spend the next 10 years sleeping on concrete? Make sure you don&#039;t leave the woods for at least a year, I hope you know how to hunt, fish and build shelters because you don&#039;t want any contact with civilization until this all blows over.<br /><br />Good luck soldier, your gonna need it.

				That was one of the funniest threads I have ever read.&nbsp; I kept looking for the up-vote button.&nbsp; When you put an order into silkroad, the paranoia goes into overdrive and you start seeing DEA agents behind every bush.&nbsp; Someone ringing your doorbell?

				Telemarketers can change their caller id at will with their dialers. A lot of times it won&#039;t send the call to the agents computer and bam paranoia ensues lol. If it was a cell phone i&#039;d say to check out trapcall, it will route the call to your voicemail then back to you so you can see the actual number of the caller. House phone probably harder to do.

				Im pretty sure its not the cops..&nbsp; First off if you&#039;re going to be doing anything illegal you should probably have 1-2 prepaid phones that are in no way traceable back to you.&nbsp; Using your real number for bitcoins is fine since owning bitcoins is completely legal.&nbsp; As long as you tumble your btc on their way to your SR wallet they shouldn&#039;t be able to find the number you provided during the purchase.&nbsp; But if youre doing something illegalt NEVER use your personal phone, that&#039;s just careless..
