				Just remember to open your untrusted PDFs in a clean virtual machine that you can shred after closing.&nbsp; PDFs have a multitude of security vulnerabilities that could allow malicious code execution of your machine.&nbsp; Scribd converts the data to nice clean images and html.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And I don&#039;t know about you but if I were going to infect a bunch of computers that are used to buy drugs I would include a bunch of information that would seemingly help out the criminals to deliver my malware.&nbsp; Think back to the Iliad, the first Trojan Horse in history was&nbsp; great gift for the people that it was meant to attack.

				I found this part interesting - the FBI of course in discussing methods used to identify users have inadvertently revealed methods by which people can frustrate their efforts: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But the FBI helpfully lists several ways that Bitcoin users can protect their anonymity.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Create and use a new Bitcoin address for each incoming payment.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Route all Bitcoin traffic through an anonymizer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Combine the balance of old Bitcoin addresses into a new address to make new payments.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Use a specialized money-laundering service.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Use a third-party eWallet service to consolidate addresses. Some third-party services offer the option of creating an eWallet that allows users to consolidate many bitcoin address and store and easily access their bitcoins from any device.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Individuals can create Bitcoin clients to seamlessly increase anonymity (such as allowing users to choose which Bitcoin addresses to make payments from), making it easier for non-technically savvy users to anonymize their Bitcoin transactions.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds about on the money - of course they missed out the obvious one which is paying for BTC in cash which gets around all these issues of bank accounts being traced. :-)<br /><br />V.<br />

				I read this report yesterday and it is becoming clear that the technology isn&#039;t the fault that will lead to people being caught, rather it is the &quot;last mile&quot; is what will people up.&nbsp; So getting those bitcoins into cash (and then into your pocket) is how folks will be caught.<br /><br />This means, obviously, you don&#039;t want to buy your bitcoins with a bank account - and you SURE do NOT want to sell your bitcoins and have the cash wired into your bank account. This really puts people in a hard position to get the cash out.&nbsp; <br /><br />The two options that really stick out to me are:<br /><br />http://bitcoin-debit.com/<br /><br />and <br /><br />https://www.btcpak.com/<br /><br />With bitcoin-debit, they require documents (passport) in order to obtain it; however, on can send fake documents with a little time and effort.&nbsp; Then once can go to a cash station that doesn&#039;t have a video camera and withdraw funds.&nbsp; <br /><br />The btcpak (Money pack) does not require any documentation, but it has much smaller funding limits the bitcoin-debit.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, folks, what other options are there?&nbsp; How can one cash out their bitcoins and not have a paper trail that comes back to you?

				Gold.. or alternately one could generate a plausible reason WHY you were getting all those Bitcoins.. like say leasing multiple Mining contracts (with your actual USD) then claiming that these (false front) Mining Rigs made you the coins which you then cashed out in the normal way.<br /><br />Just think of it this way.. cashing out bitcoins is not a crime. Getting bitcoins by dealing drugs is the crime. Generate a plausible way to get the bitcoins and cash out like normal. <br /><br />

				Yep, that&#039;s the dilemma that most of us realize we are in, but sometimes it takes a while: The more we protect ourselves from scrutiny, the worse we look if we do get nabbed.<br /><br />I mean, the more hidden I am from some roving LE eye, the worse I&#039;ll look if the hammer falls for whatever reason.&nbsp; The do go by circumstantial evidence you know.&nbsp; Normal innocent people aren&#039;t usually on some druggie site, throwing btc around, using pgp to hide our addresses, etc., etc...<br /><br />I mean, I like Tails, I like GPG, I like using btc, like bouncing around in TOR, like yapping on here.&nbsp; None of this is illegal...but, u know, it will depend a whole lot on how good your/my lawyer is, if shit gets heavy.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to remind myself that, hey, moving btc around isn&#039;t against the law, calm down...but then I wonder if I do that xtra bounce to an online wallet or two...will this look like money laundering?<br /><br />Fuck if I know.

Like I said, it&#039;s only if you&#039;re already being watched from other activity and they got warrant. Even if you were purchasing for sale IRL, SR has secure method for shaking up BTC that there&#039;s no way for them to trace your activity once coins hit SR so no way to know you&#039;re anything but a buyer which they don&#039;t seem to be pursuing.

				Why not just use BitInstant&#039;s cash deposit at a local bank and use those funds to do BitCoin by Email (use tormail.org) or fund a BitStamp account, which is TOR friendly. When depositing with cash you don&#039;t have to give out any personal information or have a bank account, the only downside to it is that banks do have security cameras, but thats really a shot in the dark unless you are already being watched.<br /><br />For the super paranoid, why not use Get-Bitcoin.com&#039;s cash by mail option? If you&#039;re using fake info &amp; accessing the site via TOR then there is no trail at all. Their turn around time isn&#039;t bad at all. Cash by mail via stamped envelope (coast to coast) only took 3-4 days before my coins where deposited. If you&#039;re really in a hurry you can pretty much get coins the next day if you use expressmail. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never understood why anyone would use MT GOX, especially since BitStamp&#039;s exchange rate is almost always the same as MT GOX.

				1. Open tor<br />2. Go to bitinstant.com and setup a BOA cash dep.<br />3. Make sure to use a fake tormail throwaway account and bitinstant will email your coins cia a coinapult.<br /><br />All within tor!<br /><br />Just throw on a hat or go through the drivethrough, I just swap tags with a dummy plate on my car long enough to slip my 500.00 to the teller.

If you do lots of exchange trading, and seeing how btc currency exchange trading is the top reason btc is used, eclipsing even SR, a Mt Gox account is a necessity since everyone has one. <br /><br />Security. Not like Mt Gox has best track record, but as an established first generation player they&#039;ve been around the longest and are thus most familiar from past experience on how best thwart constant attacks and remain secure. For this reason, I would hesitate with any new exchange site since I have no idea how competent they are or if they have any idea how to handle the overwhelming number of attacks they&#039;ll be subjected to once they become established. Your information might be compromised without your knowledge should they do a poor job just setting up their server infrastructure. Look at what just happened to bitcoinica.<br /><br />Never used bitstamp but I would make sure to always CAREFULLY go over the ToS of any new service no matter how promising the cutthroat rates they have on offer are and wait for a while to watch them in action before signing up. Find out if they guarantee your deposits and how much, and how they store your info, etc.

And the more it&#039;s enjoys wide scale adoption, the more carnage incurred should it be taken out, the less likely it would happen. Also, the BTC code is very dynamic because it&#039;s modular, so it&#039;s capable of adapting to emerging technological threats before they happen.<br /><br />If they start requiring ID to make BTC harder to obtain anonymously, then the vast numbers of people that have stockpiled bitcoins will be able to sell them at a premium for cash to anonymous buyers. :) There are enough exchanges that would be unaffected, but this might have the unintended affect of driving the value of the currency up which is not what their goal is.

				mtgox has informed users that they are in full cooperation with law enforcement. dwolla is a usd based business, yes? this say to me that usa le is breathing down the neck of mtgox and dwolla, who are giving all the information that they are &quot;asked&quot; to hand over. <br />what will the end result be? my guess is that le has a goal of making any btc to usd transaction tracked and only possible if you have made yourself identifiable with personal information up to and maybe including social security numbers. <br />this is a sure way to shrink the activity, with btc, that those fuckers who think that they are in control(le, elected officials etc.), deemed illicit.<br />such a goal is a massive task using many man hours, and we know that with government, money is no object.<br />it has only been a year that le has had it&#039;s eye on btc and they will not stop going after it, to control it.<br />keep it anon. and stay off the &quot;radar&quot;.

The first possible intervention policy is to disrupt the Tor network. Indeed, without<br />Tor, Silk Road cannot operate. This strategy is very likely to be difficult to put in place. First, Tor has many<br />uses beneficial to society – Silk Road and other anonymous online marketplaces are far from representing<br />the majority of Tor traffic, even though this work argues that their importance is growing.

In particular, Tor hidden services, like Silk Road, have been<br />the subject of considerable scrutiny [27, 29]. Øverlier and Syverson showed that timing and intersection<br />attacks could be used to reveal the location of hidden services.

Another possible disruption strategy is to attack the financial infrastructure<br />supporting Silk Road. Bitcoin has shown, in the past, to be a very volatile currency. The June 2011<br />theft of a large number of Bitcoins from the Mt.Gox exchange [4] actually caused an abrupt collapse of the<br />currency. Certain users have been complaining in forums of the uncertainty on the prices they end up paying<br />due to the instability of Bitcoin and the various commissions they have to pay to purchase Bitcoins, and then<br />to purchase items on Silk Road [6].<br />Disrupting the Bitcoin network appears, compared to attacking the Tor network, to be a more actionable<br />possibility.

More precisely, recent research [30] has shown that Bitcoin transactions are partially vulnerable to<br />traffic analysis.

In particular, large Silk Road sellers withdrawing massive<br />amounts of Bitcoins at once may be relatively easily identified.<br />Attacking the delivery model. Another possible angle of action is to attack the delivery model.

				This is EXACTLY the kind of information that SR members need to see!&nbsp; Big thanks for posting this<br /><br />The report is pretty long, boring, and hard to read (but I don&#039;t mind tedious research&nbsp; ;D )&nbsp; so I thought I&#039;d put a Reader&#039;s Digest version of it up here. <br />In spite of my posting this, I HIGHLY reccomend that everyone reads through the entire report, since I may have missed something you would find important. <br />All my bullet points here are summarized or paraphrased sections of the report. <br />&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;<br /><br />- FBI has medium confidence that law enforcement can identify or discover more information about malicious actors if the actors convert their bitcoins into a fiat (government-regulated) currency. Third party bitcoin services often require customers to submit valid identification or bank information to complete transactions. Furthermore, any third-party service that qualifies as a &quot;money transmitter&quot; must register as a &quot;money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and implement an anti-money laundering program. <br /><br />- All Bitcoin transactions are published online and IP addresses are linked to the public Bitcoin transactions. If a user does not anonymize his or her IP address, an interested party can identify the individual’s physical location without much difficulty<br /><br />- July 2011: College researchers suggest that LEO can find you via Bitcoin transaction records, bank account info, shipping addresses, etc. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You aren&#039;t safe. <br /><br />- Third party BtC services (like MtGox) must keep records, file suspicious activity reports, and currency transaction reports to law enforcement. This is required by the Bank Secrecy Act (an anti-money laundering act) since these BtC services are, legally, monetary exchange platforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Accessing your MtGox account via TOR will likely get you suspended and reported &lt;&lt;<br /><br />- Your bank account is linked to these BtC services, and they DO keep records<br /><br />- What users can do to increase anonymity:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create and use a new Bitcoin address for each incoming payment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Route all Bitcoin traffic through an anonymizer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine the balance of old Bitcoin addresses into a new address to make new payments<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launder BC through third parties registered outside the US. Particularly services that act as EXCHANGERS/TRANSMITTERS, that convert virtual currencies to fiat currencies or transfer bitcoins between members.&nbsp; Offshore services may provide additional anonymity by allowing currency exchange or money transfer without verifying user identification or enforcing any monetary exchange limits. <br /><br />&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;<br /><br />hope this helps<br /><br /><br />

				I see ฿ like a worldwide cash payment. Frankly I think FBI has no case, do they also want all coins and cash payments to be by ID and registered? its stupid. What people buy with it is meaningless, you can buy drugs or a lamp, same as with hard cash.
