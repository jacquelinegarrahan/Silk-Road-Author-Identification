				I have the most recent version of Liberte. I had assumed for a while that this had TOR set up optimally and what not. I am not so sure that is the case anymore. Granted I don&#039;t know a whole lot about on line anonymity, but when i tested using this site **clearnet** http://ip-check.info/?lang=en **clearnet** I get some pretty alarming results. So I guess my question is, what modifications are you guys making to liberte&#039;s browser to make yourself more anonymous? Thanks,<br />D0z3r

				Yes, when browsing onion sites on the Tor network.

The result is that neither the website owner, nor a local eavesdropper, nor any single Tor server knows who requested that specific website, hence you are communicating anonymously.<br />The biggest problem with many applications is that they leak DNS requests. That is, although they use Tor to anonymize the traffic, they first send a DNS request untorified in order to get the IP address of the target system. Then they communicate &quot;anonymously&quot; with that target. The problem: any eavesdropper with more than three brain cells can conclude what website you visited, if they see that you send a DNS request for rsf.org, followed by some &quot;anonymous&quot; Tor traffic.<br />If you use the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB), download the version appropriate to what operating system you&#039;re using. It comes pre-configured ready to browse the net anonymously using a fake I.P address, not the one given to you by your I.S.P.&nbsp; :)

				Sorry if I am asking stupid questions, like I said I dont know much about the subject. Yes, I realize what TOR does in regards to giving me a fake ip, the part I am confused about is the things like DNS leaks or other weaknesses in the system. Is there a way to install the tor bundle into Liberte? I was under the impression that using the tor bundle on your normal pc will leave traces of the sites you have been visiting. Is this true? I may be way off but I thought that was why people loaded from usb. Again sorry for the stupid questions.

				You don&#039;t need the Tor Browser Bundle in Liberté Linux. To make the browser in Liberté safe, all you&#039;ve gotta do is turn off JavaScript. All connections are forced through Privoxy, a local proxy which ensures all traffic is directed through Tor. <br /><br />Also, there aren&#039;t any DNS leaks from Liberté anymore (at least not known), it was an issue in an older version, with a different browser called Midori (current browser is Epiphany). Besides, when visiting onion site, DNS leaks are not an issue, because DNS isn&#039;t used.

Otherwise, it doesn&#039;t write to a cache on a disk during normal browsing. That would be a huge privacy leak. All browsing data is stored in RAM and discarded when TBB shuts down.

I mostly worry about java exploits on windows somehow compromising TBB. But not with Liberte.
