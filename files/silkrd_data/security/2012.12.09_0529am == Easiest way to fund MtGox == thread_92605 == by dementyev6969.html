				So since the last time I funded my MtGox account with BTC (about 8 months ago) they&#039;ve changed a bit.&nbsp; I previously did a cash deposit at a bank through one of their partners, I think it was bitinstant.&nbsp; Only info I had to give them was my urban area so they could find a deposit location.&nbsp; Long story short I tried to fund MtGox via bitinstant cash deposit and now there&#039;s several things I really don&#039;t like about that:<br /><br />-They wanted a name, DOB, email addy &amp; phone #, I think it was their partner zipzap specifically that wanted this info<br />-They make me go through another 3rd party, zipzap, which I hear is well known for fuck ups<br />-The total fee I have to pay is 4%, last time it was 1% or something even smaller<br /><br />So figured I&#039;d ask the SR forums: how can I now fund my MtGox using cash deposits and not have to give any of these people a name/DOB/phone/or anything less anonymous than an email address &amp; general urban area?&nbsp; And hopefully a lower fee also.<br /><br />Seems like it just keeps getting more complicated &amp; annoying.

				unfortunately, there isn&#039;t a way to do cash deposits anonymously anymore with bit instant to mtgox :( i miss the cash bank deposit days, it was so easy back then. there are a few other sites that do accept cash bank deposits, but not with mtgox. if you read around, theres a few threads about the various sites doing that.
