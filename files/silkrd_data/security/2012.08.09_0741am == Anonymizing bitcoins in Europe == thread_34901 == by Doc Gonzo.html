				This is, I&#039;m sure, a noob question and if it&#039;s been covered before, my apologies and please direct me to the relevant post(s). <br /><br />The country where I live isn&#039;t as advanced as the US, UK or Oz and so there&#039;s not the sort of infrasrtucture available to anonymize bicoins by thru bininstant cash deposits and such.. Or if there is, I&#039;m not aware of it - if someone knows of something similar in Europe I&#039;d be interested to hear about it. Anyway that&#039;s not the main question - the main question is this: if I fund a perfectly open and unanonymous MtGox account from my own personal bank account and then send those bitcoins through a variety of different instawallets and torwallets using different amounts and tumbling and make this all several layers deep, is it really, that insecure. Obviously the most secure is to be able to anonymize the initial purchase and I know I could do that thru Vladimir (sp?) but if the instawallets are really anonymous and the tumblers really work then I would have thought using 10-20 instawallers would provide sufficient anonymity to be able to sleep at night.

No matter how well you mix the coins, if you used a traceable method such as bank transfer to purchase them in the first place, that in itself can be linked to you - it may not be possible to prove you&#039;d carried out a specific transaction but as I mention in the thread above, if you are caught signing for contraband being delivered to your home and try to plead ignorance as to its contents, would you really want it coming out in court that you bought the no. 1 digital currency for trafficking in contraband? Of course as I tell all my clients who mention naughty things like drugs I know they&#039;re really buying Bitcoins to order T-shirts and other promotional items. :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				thanks for the info. In relation to remarks about mixing and instawallters - do you have any opinions on the tor wallet service? And just so I&#039;m clear, is tumbling the same as mixing?<br /><br />cheers<br />
