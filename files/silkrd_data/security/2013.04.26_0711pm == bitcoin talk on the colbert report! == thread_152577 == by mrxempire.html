				I recently saw a clip from the colbert report where colbert interviews some money expert about bitcoins. In the interview, both colbert and the person he interviews completely trash the idea of bitcoins. They say &quot;never buy bitcoins ever, it is a bad investment.&quot; This kind of upset me, I hoped that people like colbert and Jon stewart would welcome the idea of bitcoins, since both guys tend to be very critical of the government. Do you guys think there is any truth to what they say in the interview?<br /><br />here is the link: http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/425562/april-17-2013/bitcoin-plunge---adam-davidson<br /><br /><br />

				That was pretty harsh. Bitcoin has joined the ranks of Camel Cash and Disney dollars...<br /><br />&nbsp;:(

				As a pretty faithful follower of the Daily Show and Colbert, I was kind of disappointed too. Although I&#039;m glad they didn&#039;t mention SR by name, they basically wrote off bitcoins as being useless unless you want to engage in shady or illegal activities. The economist pretty much said that you shouldn&#039;t buy bitcoins unless you have some money that you wouldn&#039;t mind losing, and that investing in bitcoins would be nothing but a shot in the dark. Oh well, what can you do.

				The majority of people in the world have never heard of Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart and probably never will.<br /><br />Cryptocurrency on the other hand, they are going to know about. Bitcoin, bitcoin 2.0, whatever.<br /><br />So who gives a fuck.
