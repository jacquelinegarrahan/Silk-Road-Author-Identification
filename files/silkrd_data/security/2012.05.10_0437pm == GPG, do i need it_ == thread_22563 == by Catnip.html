They have a character in the books nicknamed Catnip? :)<br /><br />Anyway, yes I am afraid mastering GPG is essential to becoming a buyer. At the very least you are going to need this to encode your mailing address which of course the seller will need when you want to buy anything.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				But what&#039;s with just sending messages on SR, isn&#039;t it okay/secure enough? Do you really have to use GPG for every little message you want to send, like if you just want to ask a short question? I&#039;ve actually seen a few vendors who wrote that you don&#039;t always ave to use GPG to communicate with them and messaging them on SR is fine.

				is it right, wehen i buy something i must encode my adress an put the encoded in the adress field?

PGP is like putting your message in an envelope so only the person you send it to can read it. Except, PGP is MUCH safer than an envelope. You copy the encrypted text block into the address field and wait until your item arrives. Pretty simple, really.

				As for your other question about sending your address as plain text - don&#039;t worry too much about it, it&#039;s still encrypted over Tor*, and once your vendor gets it, it&#039;s &quot;deleted&quot; from SR&#039;s servers (I quote deleted because I don&#039;t know if they are over-writing deleted data or not, but I assume they are).<br /><br />Using PGP is just another layer of protection, and good a good practice to follow.<br /><br />*Edit:&nbsp; Actually it may not be encrypted over Tor, depends if SR is using SSL, I don&#039;t know if they are.&nbsp; It will be encrypted from your computer to the Tor exit relay, at a minimum.&nbsp; It may have been an unencrypted transmission from the Tor exit relay to the SR server.&nbsp; Someone would have to have been sniffing the data from the exit relay to the SR server to see your address.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if this is 100% accurate information I am giving you, as I&#039;m no expert, but this is my understanding from what I have gleaned from some very knowledgeable people on this forum.<br /><br />Bottom Line:&nbsp; Don&#039;t be paranoid about your purchase, just use PGP going forward.

				so if the server(s) is/are seized, and &quot;authorities&quot; start digging through the data they will either see your mailing address, or an encrypted message that they may or may not be able to crack (depending on what agency is handling the data). so if your mailing address is not your home address and you have used a fake I.D. to open a P.O. box, or your mailing address is a &quot;safe&quot; address, then feel free to skip the encryption of your info.

				we have never used PGP and have never had a problem , the only way i can see there being any problem is if SR as a whole gets taken down, then the LEO will have lists of probably 10&#039;s of SR staff/moderators, 100&#039;s of coders/operators or SR,&nbsp; 1000&#039;s of vendors and 100000&#039;s of recipients, who do you think they will spend their time chasing ?!?!<br /><br />long term yes PGP is an extra thing you can do to hide your address from view, but no it is not integrally necessary in SR operation. <br /><br />you should only be paranoid if you think SR themselves will ever be compromised, and even in that case, i THINK, the LEO will be more bothered about finding the MODERATORS of the site rather than knocking on the door of every single person who possibly ordered ANYTHING .<br /><br />i think you have nothing to worry about Catnip, but if you are worried, then do the PGP thing... <br /><br />(if anyone can explain an easy way to get it operating smoothly to an idiot with a mac, then please feel free to help me get it installed and running...!) hehe :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[<br /><br />

There is a quantum resistant asymmetric encryption technique that seems to be getting a lot of attention recently called multivariate public key cryptography. Using larger key sizes increases the number os stabilized qubits required, but that wont matter when they start exponentially increasing the number of qubits they can stabilize.

				A quick tip that had me baffled till I figured it out. I use Linux and had to use the armor option to get a copy and pasteable encrypted message. Then just paste it in your PM.

				well SR say they don&#039;t keep your details logged whether you use PGP or not (understandably), and you would have to be a shit vendor if you kept a written log of addresses (obviously this could be dont by any vendor whether you use PGP encryption or not) - so the whole thing seems to me to be alot of bother for very little added security. <br /><br />basically the only benefit to the best of my understanding is if SR are lying to us all, and they DO keep details, and IF their servers are compromised then the authorities could POSSIBLY get addresses of recipients, but as i have explained in previous post, hypothetically, the authorities will potentially contact details of have 10&#039;s of SR staff/moderators, 100&#039;s of coders/operators or SR,&nbsp; 1000&#039;s of vendors and 100000&#039;s of recipients, who do you think they will spend their time chasing ?!?!<br /><br />use it if you have time and want a little extra piece of mind...

				It would seem in this case the site allowed payment to be made by Paypal and Western Union which are not anonymous.<br /><br />They also relied on Hushmail, the defective brainchild of the great Phil Zimmerman, inventor of the original PGP software. In the nature of things Hushmail retained copies of users&#039; private keys and in the face of legal action, they meekly handed them over.<br /><br />Needless to say Silk Road doesn&#039;t store your Private Keys - although I did speak to a Tor Mail user the other day who keeps a copy of his private key in his inbox and uses it to decrypt messages he&#039;s been sent using an online decryption tool in the belief this was safer.<br /><br />No, no, a thousand times no. Your private key never needs to leave your computer - just ask the people at the Farmer&#039;s Market if they agree :-)<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22563.msg243297#msg243297">Quote from: randomOVDB#2 on May 16, 2012, 12:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22563.msg241325#msg241325">Quote from: dmtdoodeelsd on May 15, 2012, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">well SR say they don&#039;t keep your details logged whether you use PGP or not (understandably), and you would have to be a shit vendor if you kept a written log of addresses (obviously this could be dont by any vendor whether you use PGP encryption or not) - so the whole thing seems to me to be alot of bother for very little added security. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, we saw how trusting the board takes care of all the problems - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19162.msg192761#msg192761<br /><br />Encrypting a message takes less than 30 seconds.

				exactly right Vlad, i agree safety 1st random, unlike the monkeys who were running the farmers site...<br /><br />i don&#039;t think the remedial system they were using there, with max 3000 transactions is comparable in the slightest to SR, i mean other than both are/were market places for illicit wares - you jus can&#039;t compare such a small time operation , obv run by a bunch of friends/known associates etc... which used paypal and WU and Hushmail . i mean these guys had made some fundamental errors before they even got &#039;out of the blocks&#039; so to speak...<br /><br />still i&#039;m sure the SR admin will have studied the case carefully and hopefully taken onboard any future changes that might help the security of the site/its users...<br /><br />i mean if these guys were dumb enough to use paypal and Western, then yeah, they are obviously not afraid of breing caught with some proverbial blood on their hands, they prob DID keep a database of addresses...<br /><br />you can see from how our site is run and the way DPR conducts themselves - different ball game completely. <br /><br />also in this case from what i can see, the LE did NOT go after the &#039;low hanging fruit&#039;

				I doubt FM only had 3,000 transactions, and it was actually one of the oldest internet drug markets ever if you consider all of its previous incarnations. SR is probably one of the biggest (in member numbers) named drug networks in the history of the world, if not the biggest. But TFM was the biggest online drug market prior to it. It used to be that a forum with a few thousand members was considered enormous, before that a forum with a few hundred members was. The online drug scene is experiencing a truly exponential growth rate.
