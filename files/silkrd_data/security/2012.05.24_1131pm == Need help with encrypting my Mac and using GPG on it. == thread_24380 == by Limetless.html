				Grab GPG Tools. Import your public keys into the key manager (and secret keys from your old install if you choose to). I do all my encryption by the command line, though I&#039;m sure they have some sort of GUI method. <br /><br />To decrypt the command is:<br />gpg -o decrytedfileoutput.txt -d encryptedfileinput.txt<br /><br />To encrypt the command is:<br />gpg --recipient name --armor --encrypt filetoencrypt.txt<br /><br />This will output the encrypted file as .asc (ASCII armored)<br /><br />The command line is called &quot;Terminal&quot;, you can search for it by clicking the magnifying glass in the top right or find it in Applications&gt;Utilities. The default folder you are in is &quot;~&quot; which is common parlance for your user folder (which has the icon of a &quot;home&quot; in the Mac OS X filesystem GUI).<br /><br />To edit txt files the app is Textedit, which is also in the standard Utilities folder.<br /><br />Hope this helps ~

				echo_ has it right that you want GPGTools, but you don&#039;t have to do it through Terminal.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually pretty easy, simpler than Windows, from what I understand.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to just throw together a rough guide from memory so anyone who searches about GPG encryption on Mac OSX will have a handy guide.&nbsp; I&#039;ll assume the reader is a total Mac n00b, so forgive any simplicity.<br /><br />-Download GPGTools from gpgtools.org.<br />-To create a new key, open the GPG Keychain Access (I use Spotlight to find it easily, but you can put it somewhere specific.&nbsp; Search with Spotlight with Cmd+Spacebar.)&nbsp; Click &quot;New&quot; and put in your info, then wiggle the cursor and shit like the directions tell you to.&nbsp; Done!<br />-You probably have a key you want to keep using, so here&#039;s how to import keys (I&#039;ve only done this with others&#039; public keys, but I&#039;m sure it works with a private key as well).&nbsp; Use the Text Edit (TE) application.&nbsp; To import a key, paste it into TE, highlight it&gt;right click&gt;Services&gt;Import key.&nbsp; Now that key will be saved in the aforementioned GPG Keychain Access application.<br />-To encrypt: type what you want in TE.&nbsp; Highlight&gt;right click&gt;Services&gt;Encrypt.&nbsp; Select public key of person to whom you want it encrypted from the menu.&nbsp; Select the private key with which you want it encrypted from the dropdown menu at the bottom.&nbsp; The text in TE will change to the encrypted message.<br />-To decrypt, it&#039;s pretty much the same: paste message in TE, highlight&gt;right click&gt;Services&gt;Decrypt.&nbsp; Put in the password for your key.&nbsp; Text in TE changes to the plaintext message.<br />-There are many other options in the Services menu, like Signing and Verifying, but they&#039;re pretty straightforward at this point.<br /><br />I had an issue at first where the options weren&#039;t showing up in Services.&nbsp; If that happens, you have to fiddle around in the System Preferences (probably near the right side of your Dock).&nbsp; Select &quot;Keyboard,&quot; of all things, then &quot;Services&quot; from the source (menu on the left).&nbsp; Find everything labelled &quot;OpenPGP&quot; and check all the ones you want.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				Or competing vendors possibly attempting to discredit us? Who knows? We &quot;just&quot; received one more. Who knows why? It&#039;s pretty ridiculous, and there&#039;s plenty of threads about it. You should rely more more on the &quot;positive&quot; karma any member receives vs. the negative. imo.<br /><br />And we truly are a &quot;Crew&quot; All separated in different states for additional protection. For example, I take care of &#039;Customer Service&#039;. If &#039;they&#039; were to ever track me down, our re-shippers have nothing to worry about cuz I&#039;m (obviously) not gonna &quot;roll&quot; over some &#039;personal&#039; laying around or whatever. I&#039;d never &quot;roll&quot; regardless, but we feel it truly is a safer method of doing business, &quot;if&quot; you have a reliable Crew. Like we do. With our (soon to be doubling) selection, one person can&#039;t source &quot;everything&quot;, import, press, cook, ship, &quot;safely&quot; clean our &#039;dirty&#039; btc laundry, &#039;and&#039; be here for our customers all at the same time. It truly does takes a &quot;team&quot;.<br /><br />[Off-topic. Sorry.] :(<br /><br />But Mac (being Unix based) is second only to &quot;Opensource&quot; Linux with Tails/Liberte. You just have to remember to do things like change your MAC addy. There are programs like MacDaddy that &quot;used&quot; to work, but no more it seems. It &quot;might&quot; work for you? Try it perhaps?<br /><br />But you can manually change your MAC addy. Just put a text file on your desktop with the commands below so it&#039;s ready when you boot your Mac. Open terminal, copy paste in this order and change the MAC numbers/letters each time, turn Airport off, then back on again. It&#039;s a small hassle, but worth it! ;)<br /><br />------------<br /><br />ifconfig en1 | grep ether&nbsp; &nbsp;* (tells you your current MAC address)<br /><br />sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -z&nbsp; &nbsp; * (asks for admin password)<br /><br />sudo ifconfig en1 ether 00:27:45:78:c3:a2&nbsp; &nbsp; * (change these numbers each time)<br /><br />ifconfig en1 | grep ether&nbsp; &nbsp;* (tells you your brand new &quot;spoofed&quot; MAC addy!)<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />If there&#039;s a &quot;coder&quot; out there who could make this into a simple script with a basic GUI (with auto-rotating MAC addys&#039; perhaps?), that would be great! Then anyone could just set it as a &quot;Log-in&quot; item, and you never have to worry about it! <br /><br />It&#039;s seems like it would be pretty simple to write, and we&#039;d happily pay $omeone to do it so we could offer it up to the Mac community? <br /><br />Any &quot;coders&quot; out there that want to make a few BTC? And contribute to the community?<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TFC<br /><br />

				That&#039;s some great info, Flipside, thanks.&nbsp; I&#039;ll hold some positive karma as an IOU once I have 100 posts. ;)<br /><br /><br />Sorry off topic again, but just something I&#039;ve noticed: not trying to be rude or anything, but you (Flipside) use quotes a LOT.&nbsp; I know there&#039;s no way to use bold and stuff on this forum, but quote marks mean specific things, and usually the context you use them in sounds like you&#039;re being sarcastic or something.&nbsp; I know that you&#039;re not at all, and I can usually figure it out after a sec so it&#039;s not really a problem, but just thought you should know it&#039;s kinda confusing to read your otherwise well written stuff.&nbsp; I wish there was a way to do HTML or whatever on this forum!

				Well I am pretty sarcastic at times. And subtle things like sarcasm do not come across very well when being sent over the internetz, so I can see how that could get confusing when trying to be serious at the same time. Sorry if it makes it hard to read. I&#039;ve never considered that. I just use quotes when I want to put some &quot;emphasis&quot; on something, ya know?

I would also put 2 hidden volumes on your USB, one with some porn files just in case shit ever hits the fan. Encrypt the porn with an easier password and Tor/GPG with a more complex one. That way if you are ordered to give up your password/LE cracks it (they would crack the simple password) it will appear as though you have only encrypted your USB to hide porn as they will not be able to prove you have another encrypted volume on the USB.

Try it perhaps?<br /><br />But you can manually change your MAC addy. Just put a text file on your desktop with the commands below so it&#039;s ready when you boot your Mac. Open terminal, copy paste in this order and change the MAC numbers/letters each time, turn Airport off, then back on again. It&#039;s a small hassle, but worth it! ;)<br /><br />------------<br /><br />ifconfig en1 | grep ether&nbsp; &nbsp;* (tells you your current MAC address)<br /><br />sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -z&nbsp; &nbsp; * (asks for admin password)<br /><br />sudo ifconfig en1 ether 00:27:45:78:c3:a2&nbsp; &nbsp; * (change these numbers each time)<br /><br />ifconfig en1 | grep ether&nbsp; &nbsp;* (tells you your brand new &quot;spoofed&quot; MAC addy!)<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />If there&#039;s a &quot;coder&quot; out there who could make this into a simple script with a basic GUI (with auto-rotating MAC addys&#039; perhaps?), that would be great! Then anyone could just set it as a &quot;Log-in&quot; item, and you never have to worry about it! <br /><br />It&#039;s seems like it would be pretty simple to write, and we&#039;d happily pay $omeone to do it so we could offer it up to the Mac community? <br /><br />Any &quot;coders&quot; out there that want to make a few BTC?

				Great info thread. I use my macbook with TAILS on a bootable usb, and it works flawlessly and leaves absolutely no trace on the system. It comes with incredibly easy integrated PGP encryption and everything you need and you can plug it into any computer to use anywhere. And it&#039;s extremely fast too. I highly recommend it. Keep your tor and darkweb activity to tails on an encrypted usb that&#039;s easy to &#039;lose&#039;, and your real everyday shit on OSX so there&#039;s nothing associating your macbook with tor use (other than a mac address, which you can change). So you can still use the internet to buy sleeping pills in case you decide to fake your own death or something.<br /><br />I hear a lot of people complain about not being able to boot from a USB with a Mac. In order to boot to a usb with a Mac, you&#039;ll need a BIOS bootloader on a cd, since Macs use GUID instead of BIOS. Long story short, GUID won&#039;t recognize a bootable usb unless it&#039;s partitioned a certain uncommon way. Just search for a &quot;freeware bios usb bootloader&quot;, download it, burn it, restart your computer, holding down the &quot;option (alt)&quot; key once it restarts and the screen is white (but before the apple logo appears). Once the icons pop-up, click on the cd to boot from the cd (it always says Windows, regardless of what&#039;s on the cd). Then boot to the usb and take the BIOS cd out after it loads.<br /><br />I hope what I wrote was helpful.

I would also put 2 hidden volumes on your USB, one with some porn files just in case shit ever hits the fan. Encrypt the porn with an easier password and Tor/GPG with a more complex one. That way if you are ordered to give up your password/LE cracks it (they would crack the simple password) it will appear as though you have only encrypted your USB to hide porn as they will not be able to prove you have another encrypted volume on the USB.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are plenty of reasons to use Thunderbird (or any email client) to access your email. Just to name a couple, it allows you to access multiple email accounts vs. having to individually log in to each one each time using their webmail interface (if they even have one, and if they do often require Java). At least Tormail offers the Java-free &#039;Squirrellmail&quot; interface.&nbsp; Using a client like Thunderbird, AppleMail, ect also allows end-to-end &quot;offline&quot; encryption using Enigmail.<br /><br />Using Truecrypt has nothing to do with that. &quot;Everything&quot; sensitive (apps, keys, plists, files, ect) you use should be dual-hidden volume Truecrypted regardless on the smallest flash drives possible. Fx, it&#039;s much easier to eat an SD card vs. a USB flash drive, lol. :)<br /><br />I think you may be confusing the two concepts. However if you don&#039;t use email often, and primarily choose to use the (not recommended by us) SR-PM system alone, then just using TBB with GPG alone should be fine.<br /><br />@bkth: It&#039;s never a bad idea to spoof your MAC address. Especially if you are on a private connection, however I use them on public (or otherwise anonymous) connections as well. Your MAC address is stored on the router, which could link your specific computer to that router. This can be dangerous for various reasons, but for the average buyer it&#039;s not &#039;essential&#039;. It&#039;s more vendors that should be concerned about these things, but then again, if they ever attempted a controlled delivery/search warrant on your home due to an intercepted package, then you might be kicking yourself for not spoofing your MAC addy.<br /><br />@opi: So you have &#039;personally&#039; tried it on Snow Leopard then? Just to be sure it wasn&#039;t a small copy/paste error or something. <br /><br />If so, then I wouldn&#039;t know why it wouldn&#039;t work with Lion. Perhaps a Unix geek could chime in? Or perhaps try a little googling and searching on some Mac forums in case something did change with Lion. If that&#039;s the case, you may find more luck there. There are tons of great Mac-forums with very intelligent, helpful members. But I still can&#039;t imagine simple commands like that would change . But then again. I am a perma-fried space-case. ;)<br /><br />@ michaeljackson: Were you able to install Tails to usb to run on your Mac without using a Windoze computer? It&#039;s seems like a hassle to do it any other way.<br /><br />You can accomplish the same &quot;leave no trace&quot; ability using most of the info on this thread as well, but agreed, as I mentioned Tails/Liberte IS preferable for many reasons as it does many things automatically, like spoofing your MAC addy. I do believe? Either Tails or Liberte does as least I&#039;m pretty sure.<br /><br />But then again, if you&#039;re &quot;really&quot; sneaky, you can use Thunderbird/GPG ect and spread the essential files across TWO flash drives. (So one doesn&#039;t work without the other). Hidden separatly. Like needing two keys to launch a nuke. To be extra sneaky, &#039;perhaps&#039; you could use your iPod, ect and put a hidden-volume on there? ;)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TFC<br /><br />

				Well, the new version of Tails has a Tails USB installer built into it. I just burnt Tails to a dvd, loaded it up, put in a flashdrive, ran the Tails USB Installer in the applications menu and it created it for me. I use the USB instead of the dvd because it&#039;s about 1000x faster and they enabled persistence, so you can keep all your sensitive information (like PGP keys, bookmarks, shell-scripts I wrote to change my mac address) on the same USB on a different encrypted partition. Also with USB it frees up the cd-burner. Comes with built-in wifi-cracking tools too. The new Tails distro is definately worth checking out, especially for persistence.

Here&#039;s a link to their website with instructions on how to put it on a cd.

Another clearnet link<br /><br />http://www.plop.at/slide16en01.html<br /><br />Basically, just use the arrow keys to go down to usb and push enter. If you have a working bootable usb drive with a live OS on it plugged in it&#039;ll boot from it, even on a Mac.<br /><br />I suppose you can just put the tor browser bundle .app and your gpg app on a usb and open it from that in OSX if you really want to. I believe in OSX files in the trash are written over with random data when you empty the trash so your deleted files aren&#039;t recoverable, but I only read that somewhere so I don&#039;t know for sure. You won&#039;t need to put your Tor Browser Bundle or anything else from your computer on the usb if you use TAILS. TAILS is a linux distribution that routes all your internet traffic through tor automatically and can be put onto a usb. Basically a mini portable Operating System. Last clearnet link<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/<br /><br />Changing your mac address isn&#039;t really 100% necessary for a newbie. Personally, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it if you&#039;re only a buyer. I only do it for peace of mind and to make myself feel like I&#039;m fucking over Whitey. That guy is a complete dick. I was man-handled by his goons once, and there was doo-doo and feces all over the wall in the jail. I was accused of terrible things. I would never touch a child.

				Hey michaeljackson.<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t sure if you would be back or not, but quick question if you may perhaps have an answer?<br /><br />Followed your instruction along with the instructions along with those on the Tails website.<br /><br />After downloading the .iso and trying to burn it to DVD using Disk Utility, I get this error:<br /><br />&quot;Unable to burn &quot;tails-i386-0.11.iso&quot;. (not recognized)&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps I should just download another torrent of Toast and try that instead, as I&#039;ve always had more success using Toast vs. DU. But just thought perhaps you may have some insight?<br /><br />I would just like to &#039;play around&#039; a bit with Tails/Liberte is all, especially if it can be as easily installed on OSX these days as you mentioned. If possible. <br /><br />But so far...not possible. :(<br /><br />Oh. And quote:<br /><br />&quot;I believe in OSX files in the trash are written over with random data when you empty the trash so your deleted files aren&#039;t recoverable, but I only read that somewhere so I don&#039;t know for sure.&quot;<br /><br />This is only if you choose the &quot;Secure Empty Trash&quot; option. It takes FAR longer, but well worth if you need to delete sensitive files of course.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />

				Hey flipside,<br /><br />Yeah, I just used Toast to burn it. I love me some Toast. It&#039;s one of those rare burning programs that never lets me down. Right-click, &#039;Toast it&#039;, done. Disk Utility&#039;s burner has always been funky for me too. Maybe due to the huge pile of money Apple is currently rolling in, they forgot to fix it after an update or something. I hear you on never wanting to even &#039;look&#039; at a windows screen again. I find I have to actively try not to be the stereotypical &quot;pretentious Mac douchebag&quot; when it comes to talking to people about windows, but it&#039;s just soooo hard not to be.<br /><br />Also, tried KisMac upon your recommendation.

				michael,<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid! Stand up and say it PROUD! Windoze is nothing but YEARS and YEARS of sloppy code compared to ANYTHING Unix-based! :)<br /><br />OSX, although &#039;Closedsource&#039; is at least Unix-based and a lot more &quot;user-friendly&quot; than Linux for sure.
