				Most of my buyers are too stoned to use Tor or PGP so I&#039;m looking for easy, but still relatively secure solutions for communication.<br />(This is obviously not on SR)<br /><br />Once a buyer get busted for whatever reason, the main problem will be undeleted emails containing orders, amounts, drop points stored localy or on the webmail account, which will be subpoaned, recovered, investigated, flagged etc. I bet most of them don&#039;t even delete emails, not to mention those can be still recovered.<br /><br />Privacybox was great (now discontinued), buyer did not have to send an email to contact me, so at least there were emails on their machines or mail accounts. Privacybox provided a form, and after the buyer filled it in it was encrypted and forwarded to my mail account.<br />Hushmail provides a similar form but I never used it I don&#039;t trust hushmail, or privnote nor it&#039;s clones.<br /><br />Thought about drafting, sharing the same email account and leavin messages as drafts<br />- I can delete incriminating messages<br />- it&#039;s not a personal email account of the buyer so less likely investigated.<br />- see login times so I know if he read my message, or still checking if there&#039;s any.<br />- see current IP address<br /><br />Any downsdides with this apart from the obvious, that messages are probably stored on the server indefinetely.<br />Any better *EASY, POTHEAD SAFE* solutions? <br /><br />Note that this is not for my owns security because behind Tor and layers of encryption and anonymous bitcoin transactionsm I feel seafe enough from local LE, this is for the safety of the buyers.<br /><br />
