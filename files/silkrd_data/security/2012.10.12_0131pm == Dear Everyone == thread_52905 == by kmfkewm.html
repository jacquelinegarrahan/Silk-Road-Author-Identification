				It is not illegal to make a video confession that you traffick in drugs and it is also not illegal to send said video to the DEA with your fingerprints and signature included. Keep this in mind.

				No it&#039;s not illegal to confess to a crime. However if the crime itself is illegal (which it is by definition), then you are probably going to get prosecuted based on your confession.<br /><br />kmfkewm, what point are you trying to make exactly?

				I am sick of seeing people saying that &#039;using a VPN from someone on this forum cannot get me busted , it isn&#039;t illegal!&quot; and &quot;who cares about anonymity with Bitcoin, buying bitcoin is legal!&quot;. I see people saying these things here on a daily basis.

				<br />TOR&nbsp; connection&nbsp; to a VPN = &gt; OK<br /><br />VPN&nbsp; connection to TOR = &gt; GO TO JAIL<br /><br /><br />That said, there are uses for VPN&#039;s but if you aren&#039;t smart or don&#039;t follow do your research you going to get busted..

				^^Yeah, VPN &gt; Tor at least hides your use of tor from anyone looking to do timing correlation attacks or trying to confirm that you&#039;re using it in the first place. The point is not to use VPNs advertised on SR.<br /><br />Put it this way: If you were LE, wouldn&#039;t it make sense to become a vendor and sell a VPN service that can easily be used to collect the IPs of various Silk Road members? If the VPN requires authentication, you will also have to supply a login that, from what I&#039;ve seen, is not anonymously generated. If the seller creates your VPN account he will be able to monitor the IPs that connect to it. Connect from an IP that can be traced back to you, and your anonymity is now completely neutralized.<br /><br />Even if the seller is infatuated with revolution and is all for &quot;the cause&quot;, there&#039;s no telling what they&#039;ll do tomorrow. They may never get raided, but that doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t have some personal reason for holding that IP over your head, i.e. blackmail, revenge, etc. It&#039;s so much easier to register for a well known VPN service that handles thousands of users and can&#039;t tell why you the individual is signing up.
