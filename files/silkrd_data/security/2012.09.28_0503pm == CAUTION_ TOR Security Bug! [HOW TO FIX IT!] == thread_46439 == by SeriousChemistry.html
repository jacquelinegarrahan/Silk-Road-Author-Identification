				It has been discovered a severe security bug in Firefox related to websockets bypassing the SOCKS proxy DNS configuration. This means when connecting to a websocket service, your Firefox will query your local DNS resolver, rather than only communicating through its proxy (Tor) as it is configured to do. This bug is present in current Tor Browser Bundles (2.2.39-1 on Windows; 2.2.39-1 on MacOS and Linux).<br /><br />To fix this dns leak/security hole, follow these steps:<br />1. Open TOR and Firefox will open automatically.<br />2. Type “about:config” (without the quotes) into the Firefox URL bar. Press Enter.<br />3. Type “websocket” (again, without the quotes) into the search bar that appears below &quot;about:config&quot;.<br />4. Double-click on “network.websocket.enabled”. That line should now show “false” in the ‘Value’ column.

				Thank you for the information. This configuration option is also present in Tails, and I would assume in liberte as well. Mine&#039;s set correctly, but if you&#039;re running an older version you might want to check it.

				Changing the setting in about:config is the workaround, not the fix.&nbsp; With the proper fix, it is fine to have &quot;network.websocket.enabled&quot; set as true.<br /><br />I assume the latest version of the tor browser has the proper fix, although I haven&#039;t tested it.

				Uhm SeriousChemistry please tell us how to reproduce the bug.<br /><br />Everyone, turn your settings back to default,this guy most likely has no idea what he&#039;s talking about.<br /><br />If you care about security, install NoScript and forbid everything, that fixes a lot of vulnerabilities, including this one (which doesn&#039;t matter because it was fixed half a year ago as people have already said multiple times in this thread).

				As someone already pointed out on page 1 of this thread it doesn&#039;t matter what your settings are because the bug is already fixed.
