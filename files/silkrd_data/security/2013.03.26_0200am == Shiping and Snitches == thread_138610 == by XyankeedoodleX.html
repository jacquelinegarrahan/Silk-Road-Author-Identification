				Hello,<br />I&#039;m just here to let everybody know there is, in my opinion, no such thing as a &quot;hot address&quot;. I have had LOTS of weight shipped to a home that was involved in a raid because of a grow operation that was there. I have had MULTIPLE shipments of 4 pounds of weed to personal use amounts of nearly any other drug. All of these have arrived at the home successfully. THE SAME HOME THAT WAS RAIDED FOR A GROW OPERATION. If the vendor knows how to package something and isn&#039;t a complete retard then you will be fine shipping nearly anywhere.<br /><br />Now with that being said it IS possible to get caught having something shipped. If you know you are having something shipped PLEASE make sure you are the ONLY person at the location when the package arrives and is opened. If you are at the location with somebody who is a confidential informant, CI, and they see you open the package then you WILL get charged for receiving drugs in the mail. The most common way to get caught is a snitch. I have dealt for a VERY long time and the ONLY way I have ever gotten caught is because of little pussy ass bitch snitches. <br /><br />Moral of the story, DON&#039;T FUCKING TRUST ANYBODY!!! <br /><br />*end rant*<br />&nbsp;;D

				While I wish that was rock-solid proof all addresses are safe, I really don&#039;t think it is.<br /><br />Imo Just because a place was raided for something, doesn&#039;t mean it will be put into the USPS/US Customs watched address database... I mean if the guy at that address was caught shipping stuff in/out though the mail, that may be a different story.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if every address that was visited by LE was entered into the watched database, not many addresses would be unwatched.&nbsp; (too many to deal with)<br /><br />@axeman...<br /><br />While I do think many people will get scared by LE intimidation and snitch, I don&#039;t think the percent is 99%... over the years I&#039;ve known many that took their own licks and not ratted out.&nbsp; But with that said, if people must be trusted, trust as few as possible.&nbsp;

				I didn&#039;t think about it from that perspective NickNack. Good point. But I would assume that a grow house in a suburban area with nearly no grow houses would be a home that was put on the watch list...not to mention when they raided the home the grower hadn&#039;t had first harvest yet and was getting weed from somebody who got it in the mail.<br /><br />Also I can say proudly I have never snitched. I take my punishment for my actions. Unfortunately A LOT of the people in our &quot;field&quot; are pussy ass bitches that will snitch to save their own skin. Personally, I wouldn&#039;t be able to snitch on somebody. Not only would the be a COMPLETE misuse of trust for somebody who is helping you out by getting you something illegal but I would NEVER be able to help out the DOUCHEBAG narcotics task forces assholes that think they are judge, jury, and executioner. Now with that being said I do understand how sometimes people may get scared an intimidated by 6-20 people running up on them with ski masks, guns drawn, and yelling at you if you have never had a run in with law enforcement. On the flip side to that somebody who HAS had run ins with law enforcement may be more likely to snitch because they have a heavier sentence if they get in trouble.<br /><br />Careful who you fuck with.

				Yeah, thought I would reiterate that, the message I wrote to myself and underlined about 6 times on my last acid trip was basically:<br />Only YOU (to me) are responsible for what happens to you! Trust Fucking NO ONE. That means fucking NO ONE. <br /><br />Now of course if we are making any type of deals outside the road, then we have to make agreements with other people. So I came up with a number of controls to limit the damage anybody could do to me. I have been snitched on before (no proof..) and so had the detectives on my ass trying to get me to flip for them. This will depend on what agency is doing the operation but one key thing I noticed was that they wanted me to set up a meet in a public place within one county. Public is of course safer as far as being robbed/killed goes, so I like to do a kind of mix of the two for my deals. As well as changing the meet last minute over the line into another county that I know doesn&#039;t work with said agency to see if there is any hesitation/delay at that point, than fuck them it&#039;s off. Also no, I didn&#039;t snitch on anyone, just took them for a ride while I enjoyed my freedom a little longer. Stupid move in hindsight but hey at least I learned some shit. Also check em for wires. Strip em down.

				in many states cops have a right to release busted package with drugs to the address which is under observation. So if your orders coming trough on hot address that does not means that everything is all right. Read au mega bust thread on bluelight.ru, some nice examples is there.

				I&#039;m a bit confused. If you&#039;re caught ordering off SR, whom exactly would you be in a position to &quot;snitch&quot; on? Your fucking mailman?<br />

The grow was at a home where they were also dealing out of. I&#039;m currently awaiting sentencing for getting snitched on two separate occasions. Probably going to be facing a year or more...FOR FUCKING WEED. East Coast. Getting felonies pretty much just kicks you out of the state after you are done with probation and everything.

				A thought I&#039;ve always had is what would stop you from snitching on the competition, someone you know has weight and they are straight fuckfaces who deserve to die, like upper middle class swag faggots who listened to too many gangster rap songs and sold heroin to middle school kids not to make money but to think they&#039;re cool, if I got arrested could I just give them their name if I like knew they had the same shit that I was popped with? That&#039;d be like using the police for your advantage and doing everyone a favor, whats everyones thought about that?

				Swaggots are the worst, where I&#039;m at from what I&#039;ve heard simply saying you got this from someone at this place is enough to get a warrant, the judges won&#039;t even give a shit if its like a guaranteed huge bust,&nbsp; pretty ridiculous but at the same time a good card to pull if you have to, I and so many other people would have no qualms at all setting these little faggots up, I guess its great for me b/c in my area there are so many of em I got a long list of get out of jail cards

				It&#039;s hilarious like if I had any reason or benefit no matter how small I would even give their names to police just b/c thats how much people disrespect them, like to their face, like one of my friends copped nugget off one of them and thought he got sold short and was just like &quot;SIDDOWN&quot; and he made him take off his $300 shoes and take out his iphone and was just like &quot;I&#039;m taking this&quot;, and the kid just let him b/c thats how bitch he is hahaha, funniest shit ever, I would have no problem at all letting them get assraped in prison just out of principal.
