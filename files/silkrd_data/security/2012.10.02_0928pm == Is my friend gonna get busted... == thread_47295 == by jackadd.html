				Well my friend isn&#039;t very bright he told me he got bitcoins and bought something two days ago (not gonna say what) anyway I asked him how he got the bitcoins into his account and this was his response: &quot;Easy I went on FIREFOX and bought some coins on a site, then went to the bank to get them deposited in a site and then sent them to my account on SR and used Tor to get back on the site to buy ___&quot; I haven&#039;t told him that he fucked up by not covering his ass yet I just wanted to come here first to see if he is indeed screwed. So yeah that&#039;s my question is he gonna get busted ?

				Of course not BUT using them to buy illegal drugs is. He sent them straight to his SR account withot using coinfog or tor to create a anonymous wallet before sending it here and buying something.

				If he didn&#039;t send a big amount he should be alright. Just in case ask him to write on the package &quot;return&quot; as soon as he receives it and wait for a couple of days. If LE don&#039;t show up in the first two days is unlikely they will come after him + there is no way to prove who&#039;s account is who&#039;s on SR unless of course he&#039;s stupid and keeps the login under his keyboard.

				I dont see a problem here.<br /><br />You dont need to give your ID when you goto the bank and deposit money in the bank.<br /><br />if the webpage your talking about got raided or something and gave up their information (which wouldnt happen) then they would have PERHAPS the IP of them making the original booking. but its alot of backwork to link that to the wallet, and then link that wallet to SR, then link that SR Wallet to the purchase.<br /><br />do you really think the police would be able to do this much legwork?<br /><br />

You wont get busted for anything bitcoin related<br /><br />only way you are getting in trouble is if they find the drugs in the mail and do a controlled delivery. They wil then take your computer and search it and use the history on it just for more evidence when prosecuting you for the drugs.

				Well the purchase was domestic too so they wouldn&#039;t search through it... so I&#039;m guessing there&#039;s absolutely nothing to worry about then?&nbsp;

Imagine if you&#039;re a cop and your superior says &quot;Go make some drug busts&quot; - How much time and energy are you going to expend trying to nail some guy that purchased Bitcoins and then transferred them to SR. I suspect your fellow officers would outright laugh at you if you brought in &quot;George&quot; the accountant for questioning because of a $100 transfer to shady website. What criminal activity could be proven?&nbsp; It&#039;s hardly a smoking gun let-alone a major bust. Mild paranoia can be a good thing - it keeps us all on our toes and doesn&#039;t make an easy job for any kind of LE, but I think in this case the guy is cool.

				I&#039;ve sent coins from bitinstant directly to SR through a bank deposit. I&#039;m really not worried at all because like someone had said before, you don&#039;t need any personal information to make a deposit. Almost everytime I went in, they assumed it was for rent haha

				i highly doubt the DEA is gonna devote any manpower to hunt down the owner of bitcoin address 175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W because the last transaction went to SR...<br /><br />if i understand correctly the blockchain info only states how much money is being transferred and where it came from and went to...it says nothing about what it was spent on...

				No, he won&#039;t get busted. I don&#039;t know why people on SR seem to not even read what SR does itself, or know much about Bitcoins at all. <br /><br />* Bitcoins themselves are very difficult to track. It is not worth the resources or manpower for police to track your &quot;friend&quot;. They only care about vendors. Now if your friend is buying huge amounts, then they will consider him a vendor. Otherwise, you don&#039;t need to worry. <br /><br />* SR tumbles your bitcoins for you. Meaning the bitcoins you put in, are not the bitcoins the vendor gets. They are moved around to many vendors from all sorts of countries. For example. If you deposit $20 at your bank on Thursday, and take $20 out on Sunday. You will not get the same $20 bill. The same goes for SR. You are no more secure doing alll your Bitcoin activities at a public lan (where they all keep LOGS), then you are doing them at your office.<br /><br />Next time. Download TAILS, toss it on a USB and do everything SR related from that stick. It makes no difference where you do the bitcoin stuff.

				I think it&#039;s also worth mentioning - someone please correct me if I&#039;m misinformed here - that there&#039;s no way anyone can know that a wallet address is a SR wallet just from the address alone.

This is true.<br /><br />The blockchain only shows that your BitCoins went from address x to address y. Only the Silk Road database knows that it contains address y.<br /><br />The only way you can get busted through this is if Silk Road itself gets busted, and LE obtains the unencrypted database. Then they will know someone sent BitCoins to SR from address x.<br /><br />Then, if they manage to link wallet x to you, they can prove that you sent BitCoins to SR. Which in itself, still isn&#039;t a crime.<br /><br />Is that a likely scenario? Not at all. <br /><br />Will they go through all that trouble just to get some very circumstantial evidence? No way.<br /><br />That said, it never hurts to introduce some extra layers of security.
