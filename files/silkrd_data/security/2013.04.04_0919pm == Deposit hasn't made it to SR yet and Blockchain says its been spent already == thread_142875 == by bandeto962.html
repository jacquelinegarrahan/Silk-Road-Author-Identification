				So yea, I went from Bitinstant -&gt; SR wallet. Blockhain shows the transaction has been sent to the wallet and then sent from wallet. What could be causing that? It was a pretty sizable deposit, and I&#039;m a little sick to my stomach just at the thought of losing that kind of money. I&#039;ve been using the road for over a month now and haven&#039;t had this issue before.<br /><br />Deposit was sent directly from Bitinstant around 5 hours ago. Usually it only takes 30min - 1 hr.<br />

				Ah, I see. But that still doesn&#039;t explain why it hasn&#039;t yet showed up on my account. I understand sometimes there are delays, but I&#039;ve never had to wait more than an hour. Is 5 hours normal?
