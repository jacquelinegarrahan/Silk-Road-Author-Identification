				Title: <strong>Hoarding Prescription Meds?</strong><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the legality of hoarding prescriptions (opiate pain meds, C2) In the USA? Let&#039;s say you have a bunch of bottles of pain meds that are less than half gone?<br /><br />1) What happens if police find these and no other drugs in your house?<br /><br />2) What happens if police find these and you have other drugs in your house (weed). Do the pain meds automatically become evidence against you (e.g. a controlled delivery to bust the weed you got on SR)?<br /><br />3) What would be a good excuse if you are ever questioned about them?

				If the name on the bottles is yours than I don&#039;t think they can count against you in any way, however, if they&#039;re not prescribed to you then I believe it is either a felony or misdemeanor depending on quantity.

				- If they&#039;re prescribed to you, then there isn&#039;t an issue as far as having not taken them and being in possession of them.<br />- The pills in the bottle need to match the actual pills dispensed; yes, this is on record, the &#039;Teva yellow oval generics with Z markings&#039;, etc. It&#039;s often labeled on the bottle for a C-II, but, even if not, most officers/agents who work with diversion know to check this. (Having -more- in the bottle than was prescribed would also be a problem, it raises awkward questions.)&nbsp; <br />- You may be in a tricky situation with the person who prescribed them, if they were prescribed as a to-be-taken-regularly dose, rather than an as-needed dose, and you have a great excess. It&#039;s not the end of the world, it&#039;s kind of awkward.<br />- Other C-Is in the house don&#039;t invalidate the presence of your prescribed medication. People can have cocaine, MA, cannabis, whatever, but their prescribed Opana is still considered legit. Still, a tricky situation with the prescriber in that case.<br /><br />- If they&#039;re someone else&#039;s meds, or (potentially) if they&#039;re out of the bottle/mediset, then having them is a misconduct-involving-a-controlled-substance charge related to the amount and schedule of the drug.<br />If you pre-load a weekly mediset on your own, -save the bottles-.<br />If for some reason that&#039;s just impossible, then ffs, get a printout from the pharmacy of the current rx for some degree of verification.<br /><br />--f.

For some reason, I would think that if the cops come busting through your door with a felony warrant for receiving drugs across state lines, they are going to try and make an example out of you, especially if they know it&#039;s from SR. They would love the media hype it would create, and I&#039;ll bet they&#039;d love to make the news story more juicy by reporting that a large of amount of XX narcotic pain meds was seized as well, since a personal sack of weed would sound kind of pathetic by itself. <br /><br />It&#039;s no secret that police conform to local cultural/media pressures, and unfortunately the area we are referring to here is a an area that has huge narcotic problems, and the cops are dirty as shit when making drug busts.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if they don&#039;t charge you with it, I can totally see them confiscating the legally prescribed, correct-name script-bottle just to &quot;aid in the investigation&quot; or something. What do you think about these type of scenarios? Plausible or unlikely?
