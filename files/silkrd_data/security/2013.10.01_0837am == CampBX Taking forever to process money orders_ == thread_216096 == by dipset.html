				I sent them quite a lot of money recently that they received Thursday, and still nothing in my account after three business days. I have limited experience with them but have realized they&#039;re processing time is pretty sporadic, but not crazy long ime. I sent them like five support tickets, the first I got a response saying Saturday I would probably see the funds. But all others have been ignored it seems and I am getting really frustrated. Anyone else had wait a really long time for them to get their fucking job done?

				Don&#039;t worry you&#039;ll get your BTC.&nbsp; Mine also took a long time, I sent in a money order.&nbsp; If I remember right it took them a full (business) week to clear it.<br /><br />Been using localbitcoins ever since.

				Thanks for the reply, have been pulling my hair out as this is a time sensitive issue for btc. Anyway, they are usually much faster and at least respond to support tickets of which I&#039;ve sent about seven or eight with only one reply. It&#039;s just bullshit they can&#039;t process four money orders in the time they claim. It has been three times over their supposed processing time.
