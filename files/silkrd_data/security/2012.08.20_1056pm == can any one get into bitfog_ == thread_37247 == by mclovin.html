				Same here, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. If bitcoin fog is down for more than 48 hours then I would panic.

				Yeah, I haven&#039;t been able to log in to Bitcoin Fog for over 12 hours now. It went down right after I made a couple of deposits too. :(<br /><br />I wonder if the mixing still occurs during this down time, but I kind of doubt it. So, assuming the server data is recoverable and nobody ran off with our money, the best case scenario is we have to wait longer before safely using our coins.<br /><br />I checked their Twitter feed, but there haven&#039;t been any tweets in months. I wish they would at least let us know what is going on.

				Bitfog get&#039;s shut down when they get attacked, no need to worry it&#039;s just a safety procedure.<br /><br />- O.S.

				Since when is a DOS attack nothing to worry about, especially for a place that holds on to people&#039;s money?<br /><br />I guess going down is better than being hacked to where funds are looted, but making denial of service attacks super easy isn&#039;t an ideal security feature.
