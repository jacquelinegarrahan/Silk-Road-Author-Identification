				&nbsp;Tonight when I first booted up ToR, I happened to be watching the network map, and was watching the relays build up and bandwidth etc just for shits n giggles<br />when I notice that when I click on the relays I&#039;m supposed to be connected to, none of them show ANY &#039;descriptive data&#039; (I dont know what it&#039;s called) the stuff beside the relay showing it&#039;s name and bandwidth allocation etc, that bit was blank, and none of the relays I was connected to &#039;showed&#039; anything.<br /><br />&nbsp; This was REALLY weird, as it&#039;s never happened before, and it got my attention.&nbsp; Then when I looked at how many relays were connected, it was exactly 1600!<br /><br />WTF?&nbsp; :o Then I noticed that NONE of the relay names that &#039;normally&#039; grace the top of the page i.e. &#039;Dorrisdbrown&#039; and other large bandwidth relays!<br /><br />I stopped ToR and then started it again, and this time I got the &#039;right&#039; place, with over 4000 relays and nyms I knew!&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br />what the fuck is going on there?&nbsp; ???&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone?&nbsp; :D <br />&nbsp; The idea that a multinational LE &#039;taskforce&#039; of some kind, or maybe it&#039;s &#039;just the NSA&#039; have made a somehow &#039;separate&#039; onion relay which is entered via &#039;real&#039; ToR servers or something?<br /><br />whatever it was, it was the weirdest &#039;anomaly&#039; I&#039;ve ever seen while using ToR, particulary the fact it stopped loading relays at 1600?!?&nbsp; &nbsp;what a weird number, for several reasons, not the least it&#039;s the white house&#039;s street number no?<br /><br />I&#039;d really love to hear if anyone else has had a similar experience&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Hmmmm motek&nbsp; ???
