				If you&#039;re using Winblows you can never be 100% certain to get everything unless you go to www.dban.org and use that software to wipe your drive. Then re-install winholes.<br /><br />Short of that a program called ccleaner will clean up your registry. Follow that with software to erase your free space like SDelete.

				a CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a removable/upgradable 2-inch square chip that is basically the &#039;brain&#039; of your computer system.

When you &quot;delete&quot; a file in Windows, it doesnt really get deleted, the space that the data is occupying is nominated as &#039;free to be used by other files&#039;, but the original data will still be there for eternity until it is overwritten by something else.

				CCleaner is a handy piece of software for everyday use but when it comes to wiping a HDD of any incriminating evidence which can&#039;t be recovered with Police Forensic Equipment, I wouldn&#039;t touch it with a barge -pole. ???<br />To safely wipe your HDD of ALL DATA, leaving it unrecoverable by forensics and giving you peace of mind, use the software, Dban. :) :) :)<br />Darik&#039;s Boot and Nuke: -&nbsp; http://www.dban.org/<br />How To Delete and Wipe Your Data Securely With DBAN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwCCim2V_J<br />DBAN wipes the entire drive -- boot sector, OS, swap space, slack space, everything.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				It&#039;s worth noting that it takes time to wipe one&#039;s hard drive.&nbsp; There are also concerns when dealing with a Solid State Drive (SSD, which is what most mid-to-high-end laptops contain these days).&nbsp; The way they work makes permanent data erasure less straight forward.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure DBaN can handle it, just don&#039;t expect it to be finished before the cops are done breaking through your door or something like that; and remember it&#039;s a little more complex than usual with a SSD.

As he deleted all his posts, his thoughts disappeared with him when he left but I am 100% sure he didn&#039;t trust the fact that any data on them could potentially be recovered with new techniques as SSD&#039;s use flash memory, unlike conventional HDD&#039;s. As you know, the Guru knew what he was talking about and his posts always made complete sense and were very informative. :) P.S - I was going to look for some info but I&#039;m closing up soon. ;D

				I think the most problematic would be a hybrid drive, which is pretty common these days too.&nbsp; They&#039;re drives that are 50% or 75% a regular hard drive, but are 25% or 50% a solid state drive.&nbsp; What they do is constantly analyze the data that&#039;s accessed most frequently and migrate it off of the larger, slower, cheaper regular hard drive and keep it stored on the solid state drive.&nbsp; They do this continually, always updating and maintaining the fastest balance.&nbsp; The operating system and program files will likely be on the solid state drive, and things like data or documents will probably be on the slower, less complicated hard drive.&nbsp; The real problem is how they do this, how they track the information, where that data is located, and how it may be recoverable even after the entire &quot;hard drive&quot; (in total, both parts included) has been zeroed (0s written to literally every possible location -- total erasure).<br /><br />I don&#039;t have those answers, but I just thought it was worth pointing out so that people at least know there&#039;s additional concerns when dealing with these kinds of disks.&nbsp; Hopefully that&#039;s enough to find the answers if it&#039;s important to you.<br /><br />You know, I was going to say it&#039;s a shame Guru deleted all of his posts, but it occurs to me that I&#039;ll do the same thing when I&#039;m not around anymore.&nbsp; Not like it really matters anyway -- everything we say here is probably recorded in a dozen different locations within 15 minutes of our posts, but you know... just to avoid making it *that* much easier for them and all (for all I know any &quot;help&quot; I&#039;ve ever offered here could be used to charge me with conspiracy and throw me in jail for a decade -- God I hope not though)...

				if you&#039;re really worried.<br /><br />just run it from a cheap brand new laptop.<br /><br />and then put the laptop in the fire.<br /><br />because lets face, if ur getting done... and you somehow have time. you&#039;ll be able to destroy a small laptop faster than it takes to wipe all the drives of your pc

				SSD is safe to use as long as you encrypt it before you do anything sensitive with it. Some SSD had secure erase implemented properly and can have data wiped from them, others not though. There is some research paper where they tested a dozen or so and a few of them could be completely wiped and others could not be.
