				Instawallet is currently down for maintenance. <br /><br />I have coins en route there and am slightly worried. <br /><br />Has this ever happened before? What type of time frame does this usually take? If my coins are being attempted to be sent will the btc address be available?

				Not to worry, the coins will end up at the address just fine.&nbsp; Really the coins don&#039;t actually &quot;go&quot; to the wallet.&nbsp; What happens is the entire network records the transaction of them going there, and then by consensus, they&#039;re there.<br /><br />The wallet itself can be under the ocean for all it matters, as long as everyone else records the send transaction, you&#039;ll get them :)<br />

It will be back up shortly, all patched up, and ready for more BTC.

				I also had coins transferred from bitinstant to instawallet yesterday. Bitinstant was fucked up yesterday and took much longer than expected. Of course by the time they transferred the coins Instawallet is down. I can see they transferred my coins to my Instawallet address. Then 30 minutes later they were removed from that address. Does this mean they&#039;ve been jacked? Or does Instawallet have a built in tumbler type feature? I&#039;d really just like to have access to my damn money! Ugh.... relying on other is a pain in the ass!

				Instawallet is responding well to me in my regular browser but I can&#039;t seem to access it via Tor. Is this to do with their maintenance? Is anyone else having this issue?<br /><br />Edit: after much refreshing it eventually loaded :P
