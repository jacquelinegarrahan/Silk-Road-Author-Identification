				Thanks for the good advise :-)<br /><br />I found that Btc Buyer here on this possibly-respectable listing:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Selling_bitcoins<br />But I do not trust it and dont plan to send coins unless respected folks stand up for them. They do have irreversible options but no escrow safety. Very very risky, I know.<br /><br />Vendor roundtable:<br />I think I met all the requirements before applying for access a month of so ago. I have heard it can take a while. Not too worried about it.

Start with a bogus password then once you&#039;ve successfully signed up you can reset it over Tor (the proxy can take your password). If the site prevents you from posting, hit &quot;new identity&quot; on Torbutton until you get one that isn&#039;t banned.

				we have used them and all we can say is that we have not heard anything or received anything from them and it&#039;s been one week already.&nbsp; We only lost 1 bit coin and asked for 50USD and then we couldnt even transfer our BTC balance back to our wallet.&nbsp; In our opinion it is a scam.&nbsp; Learn from our mistake so you don&#039;t make it.<br /><br />

				Vendor Support vs SR Support. Yes I need to keep that straight. Not sure which one is at the bottom of my account page &quot;Support&quot;. But dont bother to tell me. I will pay attention to that detail soon and know, lol. That support was way behind schedule so I was not planning to say anything to them &#039;till they had caught up.<br /><br />Thanks Vivid for the sad-experience report. Sorry for your loss. Please let us know if you end up getting the cash.
