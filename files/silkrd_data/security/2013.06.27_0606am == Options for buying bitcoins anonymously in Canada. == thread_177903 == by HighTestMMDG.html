				So with the recent changes to some Canadian websites, I&#039;ve been looking into some new options for acquiring bitcoins anonymously in Canada. <br />So far I’ve found the following:<br /><br />https://www.nanaimogold.com/ <br />They accept cash by mail. <br />They also accept direct cash deposits to their account up to $500.<br />They seem pretty legit. <br />They’ve been around a while and they have a presence on the bitcointalk forums. <br />Though from the feedback I&#039;ve seen, their customer service isn&#039;t always quick.<br />Looks like they sell for about 10% above mtgox.<br /><br />http://cadbitcoin.com/<br />Buys/Sells bitcoins for cash in person in TO.<br />Can’t find a way to contact them by email but their address is on their webpage.<br />Looks like they sell for about 10% above mtgox.<br /><br />http://www.bitcoiniacs.com/<br />Buys/sells bitcoins in person in Vancouver.<br />They have a storefront but I’m not 100% certain that its open yet.<br />They will accept cash in the mail.<br />They buy at 7% above the current CAVirtex rate.<br />Their customer service seems quick, responsive and friendly.<br /><br />In addition to this I have been referred to two people who sell on localbitcoins.com that some of my customers have used. They sell by cash in the mail for 3-5% above mtgox. I haven’t personally dealt with either of them but they come highly recommended by reliable, regular customers.<br />Contact me on the SR if you would like to be put in touch with either of them.<br />

				I would love to see this thread get some attention, I&#039;ve been having a hard time trying to find a way to get bitcoins since the more popular exchange changed a lot of things. Hopefully a better alternative pops up :/

				Open a business and do wholesale with libertybit, cavirtex or somebody else. Say the money is for professional trading nobody will ever know, they&#039;re bitcoins.<br /><br />Somebody is opening a bitcoin store in Vancouver, BC sometime next month. I think the libertybit guy&#039;s are part of it, dunno. I heard this from a trader I use on localbitcoins. <br /><br />Nanaimogold is also a forum mod on talkgold.com, but he doesn&#039;t take American customers anymore because of obvious reasons

				comsec&#039;s comment bring up an important point.<br /><br />For the average user, verifying your account and buying bitcoins directly through cavirtex should create no problems.<br />There is nothing illegal about buying bitcoins. There are more and more above board uses for them all the time.<br />Once you buy your bitcoins you can send them through a few different wallets before you send them to your SR wallet if you are worried about them being traced.<br />For most buyers this would work great.<br />For bulk buyers. not so much.
