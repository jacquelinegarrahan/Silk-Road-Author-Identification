				Hello, <br /><br />Ive done some looking into how to buy bitcoins but there seems to be a road block with all the routes ive looked at. First off I do not feel comfortable mailing cash in the mail. Second im afraid using an exchange and sending money to that exchange will throw up a red flag at my bank. and third there seems to be no vendors on SR who can get me 6-8k of bitcoins per month. ALSO there are no localbitoins sellers near me so scratch that too! So I decided to throw up this thread looking for advice on how to obtain a steady 6-8k worth of bitcoins per month anonymously and without paying a ridiculous Fee to get them! <br /><br />Thanks!

				You could look at the sellers on localbitcoins that accept postal money orders. The MOs are refundable if lost. Each MO has a dollar limit but I forget what that is; probably $1000. Alternatively you could do a &#039;cash deposit to bank&#039; where you deposit cash into the sellers bank account. No ID required to make a cash deposit. <br /><br />There isn&#039;t any such thing as &#039;anonymous and cheap&#039;. The more anon you want to be the more they cost.

				You cannot be serious!!!!<br /><br />If you are then you would need to spend several hundred thousand bucks buying up the latest Avalon mining rigs. Or several million paying engineers and commissioning an ASIC manufacturer to build your own rigs. Other than that your only other option is to buy from the Winklevoss twins&nbsp; ;D
