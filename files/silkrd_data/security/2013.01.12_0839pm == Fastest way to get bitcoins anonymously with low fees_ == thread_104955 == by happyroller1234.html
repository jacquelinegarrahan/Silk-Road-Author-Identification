				So I&#039;ve been on this site for a little over a year now, and I&#039;ve always gotten my bitcoins via MoneyPaks and exchanging it for coins (with zero rate) with a vendor I highly trust.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, this vendor&#039;s business has been a bit slower over the past few months, and waiting around for him to get some coins is causing me to miss out on some great deals.&nbsp; I&#039;m now looking for a more reliable method of obtaining BTC that is quick, secure, and possibly with low fees.<br /><br />Suggestions?

				i&#039;m somewhat lost myself, as information is somewhat sparse. <br /><br />i&#039;m going to continue reading the forums a bit more before i make an attempt, but it seems like bitinstant/mtgox are often recommended. <br /><br />im just not sure if i am supposed to be using my real address on mtgox.

				Information is sparse because the methods of buying bitcoins are diverse and highly dependent on where you live.<br /><br />This is a good site that breaks it down by (some) countries and the most common methods.<br /><br />http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com<br /><br />There is no single tutorial on buying bitcoins because there is no single method that will work for everyone, except maybe &quot;find some one on localbitcoins.com and make an in-person cash purchase&quot;, but even then, some people might live in far off places with no local bitcoin merchants.<br /><br />

				thanks for the link.. im browsing through that site now.<br /><br />i&#039;m kind of confused though. a few days ago i thought i could do it through money order. bitinstant -&gt; mtgox -&gt; blockchain -&gt; SR, but it appears you can skip the mtgox step and go from bitinstant -&gt; blockchain -&gt; SR? what would be the difference?<br /><br />im tempted to post a new thread, but i don&#039;t want to be asking&nbsp; questions that have been asked before.

				Do you mean blockchain.info? Because the block chain itself is not a bitcoin service. It&#039;s a record of all bitcoin transactions.<br /><br />Yes, you can transfer BitInstant -&gt; blockchain.info -&gt; SR. Some people move their coins through a few ewallets or mixing services.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the requirements of fast, cheap and anonymous tend to be mutually exclusive.<br /><br />You can do a cash deposit at a bank, or use an online vendor to trade a Moneypak, and get the coins fast and anonymous, but not cheap.<br /><br />You can do a bank transfer to an exchange and get the coins cheap, but not fast and anonymous.<br /><br />I am not aware of an online vendor who will trade bitcoins for a 1% fee. Such a person doesn&#039;t exist, although if you can find someone like that, you&#039;re golden. :)

And finding the right balacing act of security and cost. Most of the power vendors in SR offer prices and quality that far exceed street or low level dealer level. <br />Let me know if you need help getting coins somewhere near the Arizona and California border.&nbsp; (location wise).<br />Though most can be done through online. You just needed someone to walk you through or really figure it out. The forums are bustling with tips and tactics. Just dont buy from the people that spam the forums. <br /><br />S<br />thanks, got that clarified/confirmed.. i think i&#039;m ready to try the first step of the process now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
