				So I have been reading a bunch about how to ship a package. I am thinking about shipping a pound to myself, and I just want to make sure that i am doing everything right.<br /><br />I am going to 7/11 to deposit money to my buddy who works there and does anyone know if they can accept that amount of money at 7/11? Use a fake name and everything and send it to Bitinstant. (then one of my questions is where does the money go after that and how do I recover it? Using an email through tor?) Then after all that I send them to SR, and we exchange addresses using PGP. Then before the packages arrives I plan on cleaning my apartment entirely and having nothing in there that shows that I have intent to sell the weed. When the package arrives I write return to sender on it and leave it be for a bit if I take it back to my place. But I plan on just leaving it in my box for awhile since I never check my mail anyway. <br /><br />Then if by some crazy chance the cops show up, I play the stupid game that I have no idea where it came from and I don&#039;t smoke and just keep it at that. And I am just double checking, they would have to release you because they really have no proof of intent. Can they go for other charges, or would they be able to go through my phone records or anything?<br /><br />

				You might want to test out the water before you plunge in :) First have 20g sent to you to see what happens and when you&#039;re all comfortable with the shipping method of the vendor go bigger. <br /><br />I think you simply send the money from your Bitinstant wallet to your SR wallet. Not really familiar with Bitinstant myself.<br /><br />Cleaning house is a good idea, just to be extra safe.. but it&#039;s probably not necessary.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				There was a thread by a postal inspector here that said that if it is a controlled drop they will barge in as soon as you accept the package. If this is true it may mean the whole mark as return to sender and let sit advice may not be as useful as we thought. Having a clean house is ideal, it gives you a better case when you try to argue that you didnt order anything you don&#039;t know whats in it and you don&#039;t involve yourself with drugs. But all things considered, domestic is pretty damn safe.

				You could keep everything Silk Road related on a USB drive as well to be safer. Install Tor on the USB drive and run it from there etc..
