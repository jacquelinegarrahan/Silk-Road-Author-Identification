				Basically I&#039;m new to SR, I&#039;ve only done about 5 transactions so far which have each been very minor. I was hoping to further my understanding of the processes LE use to trace the payments back to you. I have not yet obtained any BTC myself, but as far as I understand the process I would use would be:<br />Deposit at Intersango (I&#039;m from the UK) --&gt; Transfer through 2-3 Instawallets --&gt; Run through BitcoinFog --&gt; Send to SR wallet<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t fully understand where and how in the process law enforcement could obtain evidence against me to use, so if someone could detail where and how they could obtain this evidence (and in what form) to use against me during this process that would be very helpful.<br /><br />Thanks.
