				I made the dumbass noob mistake of just trusting this website since it was on Evil Wiki. Put about 15 coins in, saw the message that they would be confirmed in less than 60 minutes.<br /><br />I just logged on now, and my balance is 0 btc. FUQQQQQQQQ.<br /><br /><br />Please learn from my mistake.

				How long ago did you deposit the coins? Have you checked how many confirmations the transaction has in the block chain?<br /><br />Did you pay a fee for the transaction? It can take hours to get a single confirmation for large transactions without fees.<br /><br />And why would you use a site with no known reputation? A quick Google search brings back the same thing over and over, no one knows anything about this site.<br />

				It was a dumb mistake, I simply trusted Evil-Wiki&#039;s &quot;fiduciary&quot; position. All of the services I have used from there have worked well. So, when I saw that this new mixer service charged only .0001BTC per transaction, I decided to try it out.<br /><br />I transferred .2 btc to test it. These transferred. Then I decided it was clean so I sent another payment.<br /><br />It was over 4 hours ago. There is now no message about &quot;confirmation time.&quot; The confirmed .2 btc are also gone.<br /><br />When I first deposited them, the site said &quot;Unconfirmed 15.xx BTC. Will be confirmed in 60 minutes&quot; or something similar. Now, I have logged on there and it says i have 0 BTC in my wallet.<br /><br />These BTC came from my SR account and I thought SR didn&#039;t record the transaction, and I also thought it was mixed when it came out of SR, so I didn&#039;t record the transaction details. I honestly have never attempted to trace a btc transaction. There was only one other problem when I trusted an exchanger on SR when it first started.<br /><br />Both of these have to do with me being impatient and too trusting. So, I am just warning everyone to be more wary and to know that it&#039;s a service that isn&#039;t to be trusted.

				Do you know which address you sent the coins to? Search for it on blockchain.info<br />
