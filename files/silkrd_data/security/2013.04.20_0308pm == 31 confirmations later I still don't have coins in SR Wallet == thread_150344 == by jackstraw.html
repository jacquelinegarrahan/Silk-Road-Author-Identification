				Ok So I sent BTC to my SR wallet right after the site came back after maintenance TODAY but before it was taken down again because it was running slow.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see those coins have over 31 confirmations HOWEVER I now see those coins leaving my SR wallet and going to another address with over 22 confirmations.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I click on that address on Blockchain I can see that over 20 other adresses have also sent BTC to this address along with my SR Wallet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can anyone explain this???&nbsp; &nbsp;OF course I am impatient but something seems weird here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks if you can help<br /><br />***Just realized should have posted this in Customer Support.&nbsp; &nbsp;It looks like several others are having this same issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope it gets solved.

				The reason you see your bitcoins going to various addresses is because SR has its own tumbling service... your coins get mixed up in &quot;dummy transactions&quot;. I too am waiting for coins and am on 22 confirmations. They will arrive! I&#039;m sure its because of the recent maintenance.

				Yes, mine too! A happy 420 to all!<br /><br />Also, Jackstraw: My favourite Jack Straw moment- seeing Furthur on the 4th of July, 2010. &quot;Leavin&#039; Texas... fourth day of, Julyyyy&quot; and the crowd goes wild. Everybody just knew to cheer.

				Sometimes these transfers are delayed.&nbsp; It can take up to 24 hours for the coins to show up.

				Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky......Yes Robert&nbsp; Hunter sure knows how to paint a picture with his lyrics NewStem.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s always one of my favorites that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />Thanks for the info Scout.....it was just confusing seeing the tumbling.....I haven&#039;t seen that before.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still having a hard time connecting at times but I think that has to do with more people on the site because of the special day.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve had transfers take anywhere from 1 to 33 hours. It&#039;s just the cost of doing business. As long as you&#039;re seeing confirmations, you are fine..
