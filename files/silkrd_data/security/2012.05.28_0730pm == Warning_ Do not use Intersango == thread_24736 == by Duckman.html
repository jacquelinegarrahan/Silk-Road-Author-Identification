				I have used Intersango a few times in the past and have even recommended them in the past.<br /><br />They are currently experiencing problems with their UK banking.&nbsp; This problem dosent stop them taking your money, but it does stop them from giving you any bitcoins.<br /><br />The problem is almost certainly genuine, but their response is basically that they will not transfer any money to bitcoins until their bank sorts things out.<br /><br />So how long will this take to fix?? .. They have no idea, hopefully soon although after several days they still have no more of an answer.<br /><br />Well can I have my money back?? .. No they cant do that.<br /><br />I really do appreciate that they are having issues, but their way of dealing with these issues is to make the customer wait with no real ETA until things are sorted.&nbsp; This really is no way to do business, I mean it could be a week.. do you think they will even be dropping their commission after the customer waits??&nbsp; Hell no!!<br /><br />So therefore I&#039;m warning people to not use them.&nbsp; I have no real issue with Intersango, however they are basically a Micky Mouse operation. When everything runs smooth they are fine, but the test of the worth of a business is how it copes when things go wrong.&nbsp; In this respect, Intersango simply don&#039;t have a plan, their answer is to just keep all of their customers waiting and to hope for the best.<br /><br />I am sure that other exchanges are just as bad but if we dont stop using them then they have no incentive to become better.

				Quite right Duckman. I have used Intersango&nbsp; for a number of currency exchanges and so far so good until the end of last week when I posted currency to my Intersango account which am now unable to access.<br /><br />There&#039;s no customer service, no news update- nothing. Will I get my money back? Fuck knows, but I&#039;m sure as shit that&#039;s the last time I&#039;m using their service. Any recommendations UK based?

				They seem to be having some genuine technical problems. It appears to me that their bot, who charges your account with the funds added, has stopped working. From what I hear, their staff is pretty busy normally, so I think they&#039;re really overflowed right now.<br /><br />They say they&#039;ll probably be resolved in a timely manner. I have no reason to believe it won&#039;t.<br /><br />For the time being, you need to find an alternative. However I don&#039;t see why you shouldn&#039;t use Intersango after everything has been settled.

				I will wait to hear what vlad1m1r has to say on this as he uses Intersango as part of his service and this would likely mean he has funds tied up in this technical glitch.

				I have never had issues - usually they process incoming payments several times a day. The bid for BTC is a bit perplexing at first and I guess most just pay they current rate instead of looking for lower prices.<br /><br /><br />Right now Intersango say this....<br /><br />&quot;Online banking with our UK bank is currently unavailable. Payments are being received however we cannot process them. This has happened before and was dealt with in a timely manner.&quot;<br /><br />Hopefully it will be sorted soon. <br /><br />It was better when you could pay through a popular UK high street branch in person - anon. Now they use a bank which is called Metro Bank. A few branches in London but the rest of us cannot just walk in and write a pay-in slip with the ref number..<br /><br />There is a real need for someone here to deal in BTC but I realize its difficult.

				Honestly, the best way to obtain those precious coins is to do a direct cash deposit via Bitinstant or something similar. I use bit instant a lot, and I just walk down the street to my local Bank of America and deposit the cash. It&#039;s never sketchy and the teller&#039;s don&#039;t give two shits. Once you&#039;ve made the deposit, your cash will be available on mt gox within 30 minutes or so. For those of you apposed to mt gox, BitInstant is putting out a new program that sends the coins directly to your email so you don&#039;t have to fuck with the mount. <br /><br />

Intersango couldn&#039;t confirm receipt and when I tried contacting them on IRC I had no response.<br /><br />Fortunately I anticipated a problem like this might arise and used my own stock of Bitcoins to process any pending orders. It would seem things are back up and running now but I think it&#039;d be wise to stick to small amounts of transfers for now until we see if Metro bank can handle the volume of transactions required.<br /><br />Ironically if it&#039;s true that the bank&#039;s systems were overwhelmed by numerous transactions, the less popular Intersango becomes the more reliable it will be. What I don&#039;t understand is why their computers couldn&#039;t handle it - as far as I know we use a standard software set in the UK which hasn&#039;t had any major revisions since the eighties. Certainly we have Brokers at my bank who might make several hundred transactions a day and I&#039;ve never heard of any technical difficulties but then mine is quite a small bank!<br /><br />Still, all&#039;s well that ends well I suppose. My customers will be pleased to hear I am going to build a fund of Bitcoins to make sure that orders are processed quickly even if there is such a problem in future!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				The other big problem I had with Intersango was when they changed their UK bank and didnt make it really really clear on their website.<br /><br />One of the joys of internet banking is that you can save payment details so you dont have to re-enter them every time.<br /><br />Having used Intersango successfully a few times I stopped checking their banking details each time and of course the payment went to a bank account they no longer used.<br /><br />Now some might say I should have been more vigalent in checking, but I really felt that Intersango should have done far more to warn people.&nbsp; Vlad1m1r its the equivalent of you changing your postal address and not making sure everyone was aware of that.&nbsp; Common sense will tell you that if you did that then people who have sent you money a few times before probably wont bother to check if your postal address has changed, why would it?<br /><br />Its just another instance of their lack of a plan.&nbsp; You look on their website and it gives the impression of professionalism, but I have never dealt with any company that changed their bank details and didnt make an effort to publicize that. They updated the instructions but didnt stop and think that peole who have used this a few times before might not read them especially since you can store all of these details in your own online bank account.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Anyone who&#039;s interested should message me for details.<br /><br />I wanted to respond to your post as I mention on my thread below that users are given Bitcoins at daily Intersango rates. I have been let down twice now by Intersango and just want to clarify that I now have a reserve of Bitcoins to draw on in case the exchange isn&#039;t playing nice (which is never) - as such anyone using my service can rest assured they will receive their coins in good time even if Intersango is playing silly buggers.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if the point has been raised but using an exchange which only accepts wire transfer is also risky at the best of times as of course anyone with access to the exchange&#039;s records will see the BTC address where your coins were sent and can then trace future transactions. I admit it is a small risk but would strongly advise people to use cash to buy their Bitcoins - even if you don&#039;t go through me!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Yeah lol that&#039;s the funny thing about it, they have ideas way above their station because really they are just 3 twats with silly name tags. This could come off as a bit of a generalisation but I find that people that are into I.T (which these guys are if you check their backgrounds) find it hard to grasp business/economics because the former is logic based and the latter is generally a subjective that is subject to irrationality/whim etc/emotion. Obviously there are some exceptions to this rule for example people like Steve Jobs (not Bill Gates though, he isn&#039;t that impressive if you think about it). I think the mindsets that you need to be one or the other are rarely compatible in an individual.

Probably my favourite thus far was the 17 year old who decided he&#039;d come up with an idea that was &quot;bigger than eBay&quot; but we couldn&#039;t read his business plan. Not because he hadn&#039;t written it (perish the thought!) but we might steal the idea and do it ourselves.<br /><br />When he was turned down he magnanimously offered to secure the loan on his house which we later on found out belonged to his mother&#039;s husband.
