				I decided to give Whonix a try, but I&#039;m having trouble creating the VM. I&#039;ve tried setting it up a couple of different ways, but I keep getting the same error from virtual box. It says:<br /><br />&quot;Failed to open the CD/DVD image /home/me/Downloads/Whonix-Workstation.ova.<br /><br />Could not get the storage format of the medium &#039;/home/me/Downloads/Whonix-Workstation.ova&#039; (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED).<br /><br />Result Code: VBOX_E_IPRT_ERROR (0x80BB0005)<br />Component: Medium<br />Interface: IMedium {29989373-b111-4654-8493-2e1176cba890}<br />Callee: IVirtualBox {3b2f08eb-b810-4715-bee0-bb06b9880ad2}<br />Callee RC: VBOX_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND (0x80BB0001)&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m interpreting that as meaning vbox doesn&#039;t support the .ova installation media. Is my assumption correct? And if so, is there a work-around? I know people use Whonix in vbox, so I know it is possible.<br /><br />Is there something that I&#039;m missing. I&#039;m running version 4.2.18 on a Ubuntu host. I&#039;ve never had any trouble creating a VM for any other OS (except for OS X), but I&#039;ve also never used a .ova file before.<br /><br />Also, when create the new VM, which OS should I choose. I&#039;ve tried setting it up as 32-bit Other Linux and 32-bit Debian. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what the error is about, but I&#039;m curious which is the correct choice for setup.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m guessing your running windows.&nbsp; I dont have any experience with virtual box in windows.&nbsp; Nor did you give details on how you setup your VB machine.&nbsp; But they are very easy to get going.<br />what I do first is <br />click new, choose they type of VB you plan to install then associate enough ram to it.&nbsp; next click &#039;create virtual drive now&#039;&nbsp; i use the &#039;VDI&#039;&nbsp; image.&nbsp; then i use the fixed size option, allow it enough space and wait......<br /><br />next go to the settings and storage section,&nbsp; in the dvd/cd drive area click the empty cd then next to the ide secondary tab, click the cd, from there you can load an .iso image and boot the machine and go through the install process of installang&nbsp; and operating system.<br />gl&nbsp; hope it helps.<br />
