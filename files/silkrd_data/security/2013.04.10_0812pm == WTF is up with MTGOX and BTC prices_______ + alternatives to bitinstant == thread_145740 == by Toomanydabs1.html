				&nbsp;:o :o :o :o<br /><br />So bought a good amount of coins over the weekend... through instant and had no problems... check the price late last night and it was up to 230 something... now its 130??????????????????????/ wtf.... gusss the bubble popped? any insight on this from experienced members would be appreciated... Im hoping its similar to a few weeks ago when there was a big increase followed by a big decrease in value followed by this weeks HUGE gain... now huge loss? <br /><br />Also im hearing lots of people having issues with bitinstant? i had a few orderes go through without problems... what are some alternative sites that i could use cash for? or direct bank deposit?&nbsp; I dont have a bank of America in my area so i cant do the blue sky traders route... Ive herd of bitfloor or local bitcoins.. can anyone comment on recent success with these? and which banks you can direct deposit at?

They have a CIM (Cash In Mail) option. Haven&#039;t tried it yet, waiting for BTC to settle

				How was I a troll exactly? Did I say something outrageous to purposely try to elicit an emotion reaction from you? No. And yes, at the time you posted there were about 3 other very similar threads that had useful info about the problem, and it would just be nice to have a more concentrated location of information, rather than have bits of info and replies scattered across several threads.<br />&nbsp;<br />Did I use insulting language or call you names? No. I didn&#039;t even use definites.. I said you would &quot;likely&quot; find some interesting info in those other threads, because I did. I said nothing with intentions of conflict, just helpfulness. Don&#039;t be so overly sensitive.<br />
