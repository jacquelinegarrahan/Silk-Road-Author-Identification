				Depends completely on the ISP. Mine could care less what I do. I like using a VPN because it adds another layer of security, but it&#039;s not needed.

				Yes. A logless VPN that has been paid for with bitcoins will offer you an extra layer of protection and conceal your use of Tor from your ISP. VPN services encrypt all of your packets within their network and anonymize your packets when they exit (the exit node is shared between you and usually at least 20 other people). Or if you&#039;re using SSL then you&#039;ll get end to end encryption. If you end up doing something dumb with a VPN, you won&#039;t fuck yourself totally as you would without it. Remember that we all make mistakes sometimes. Any extra layer of protection is always a good idea especially at the low cost of a VPN.

ISP&#039;s do log all TOR traffic, that is my opinion though.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />I need your help, i purchased a vyprvpn acct from sniffsniff.... And for some reason, it is not working properly and will not let me connect.&nbsp; I downloaded the program from the site that sniff said, and the username and password work fine, but when i try to connect thru the vyprvpn, it gives me an error message: 749: internal error occurred, so what the hell is going on and can anyone help me out? (I even had my IT specialist look at it, and he said &quot;He could not figure it out, know that is rare!!!)<br /><br />I really want to get this figured out, if i knew it was gonna be like this, i wouldnt have even got this one, and paid for a better one, that i could actually use, ya know!&nbsp; :(

You get what you pay for. Read their privacy policy very carefully and you will see why they should not be used.<br /><br />This is a good starting point if you want a VPN https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/<br /><br />
