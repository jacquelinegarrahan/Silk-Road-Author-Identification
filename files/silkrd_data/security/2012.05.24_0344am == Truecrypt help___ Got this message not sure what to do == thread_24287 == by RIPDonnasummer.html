				So I have a Dell Laptop and I was about to encrypt the entire thing because I have used tor and ordered from this laptop. I figure it would be safe just to encrypt the entire thing now. I got this message and not sure what to do<br /><br />Your system drive contains a non-partitioned drive<br /><br />If you are using a notebook, your system probably containts<br />a special recovery partition. After the whole system is encrypted<br />(including any recovery partition) your system might become <br />unbootable if your computer is using an inappropriately <br />designed BIOS. It would also be impossible to use any recovery <br />partition until the system drive is decrypted. Therefore we only <br />recomend that you only encrypt the system partition. <br /><br />Do you want to encrypt the system partition instead of the entire<br />drive?<br /><br />NOTE: you can create partition-hosted truecrpt volumes<br />within any non-system partitions on the drive (in addition <br />to encrypting the system partition)<br /><br /><br /><br />so what in the world does that mean? How do I know if I have a inappropriately designed BIOS?&nbsp; to be hones I do not even know what a BIOS is? I need some help computer gurus?

				get yourself a windows XP cd. fuck 7 and vista.&nbsp; delete the partitions. create a new whole one&nbsp; any formatting you do make sure its low level and just install XP. you dont want all that garbage that comes bundled on your pc/laptop from companies anyways. just slows and bogs you down. ALL worthless crap to make you think your getting a bundle of free great software with your purchase. haha. Just make certain you get all the drivers downloaded and burned to a cd or dvd before you wipe. I would recommend two lap tops go buy a cheap one at the pawn shop for 100 bucks and use it only for SR and delete the partition and start over after every purchase. and access tor even through a proxy if possible. I put nothing past the feds on what they can and can not do these days. all we can do is take the precautions we have available. Hell I do not even follow my own advice most the time cause im too damn lazy and my orders are super small and Im&nbsp; a nobody the cops could never use&nbsp; as leverage to bring someone big around me down as I know no one. Im just a drug user who sits home and enjoys being high and relaxing. Of course if i was a leo and being the skeptic that i am if i just read what i posted my response would be SUUUUREE&nbsp; &quot;thus guy is probably a kingpin&quot; haha but yeah use that cheap pc for orders and deleate format and reinstall after each order and try not to access tor from an IP registered in any account in your name. find some local cable guy working in your neighborhood one day and offering him 200 bucks to get you set up with free cable and internet. usually they do it unless they are some straight laced ass hole who thinks he is stealing by doing it.<br /><br />I know its a hassle to deleate your partiton every time and create a new one and format and reinstall but hey thats the price we pay for the life we choose. remember leos have unlimited resources time and money at their disposal most the time so they never have to rest and you do so never think I will get some sleep and wipe my drive in the morning. you might get a foot through your door two hrs into your dream of super models r Us

				LOL I appreciate the advice but I would really like to figure out how to fix the problem on my current laptop. Does anyone else have input on this topic? It would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Is it because I am running windows vista? Do I need to run Windows XP and that will solve it? Anything else I can do and keep Vista on my computer? <br /><br />

				Hi buddy,<br /><br />I would suggest you encrypt the whole drive. There is nothing on the system recovery partition you can&#039;t download again from the Dell website.<br /><br />It&#039;s really good to see you&#039;re taking your safety seriously but do bear in mind you can be compelled to hand over your password in the US and UK. I would suggest you also use Truecrypt to encrypt a USB drive and keep your Tor Browser and GPG software on there in a hidden volume.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not familiar with hidden volumes, please don&#039;t worry, I will be posting a thread shortly on this subject!<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24287.msg256571#msg256571">Quote from: RIPDonnasummer on May 24, 2012, 03:04 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">LOL I appreciate the advice but I would really like to figure out how to fix the problem on my current laptop.

				In the case of your current query, I would just go ahead. Truecrypt throws up a few of these warnings as you go but it&#039;s pretty much a disclaimer. If your system drive ( the one you boot from) isn&#039;t partitioned (which it says it isn&#039;t) then the warning doesn&#039;t apply to you.&nbsp; All it&#039;s saying is that some laptops have the recovery software ( to repair a crashed system) on the hard drive. If you encrypt the whole drive it won&#039;t be accessible. But as above you can probably make a recovery cd anyway. If you select tio just encrypt system partition you will be ok. ( if there is a system partition : fine, if not then system partition=whole drive anyway)
