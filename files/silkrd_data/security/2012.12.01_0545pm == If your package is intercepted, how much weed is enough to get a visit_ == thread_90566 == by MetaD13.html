				I&#039;ve always wondered this since I&#039;ve heard that if only a couple grams are caught then its usually no biggie, possibly a letter then move on. Although how much would be enough for the cops to pay you a visit and question you?

				Depends on where you live and other factors. In general a few grams of marijuana is too small to bother with a controlled delivery.

				That&#039;s a great question I always wondered myself. I don&#039;t know how easy it is going to be an accurate answer though. I think it&#039;s more of an opinion that leads to the result than it is a set guideline of when to visit. Any drugs in the mail could be considered a crime but at what point does the interceptor intervene?&nbsp; Is the address a known problem house in the area? Does the addressee have a known criminal history? As you stated, How much contraband is being shipped? I think these are all factors that help influence the decision to visit or send a letter.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure that you should feel any safer ordering an 1/8 compared to an oz. or pound.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think that you are,&nbsp; that&#039;s a lot of resources to waste on an 1/8, but in the end they are all crimes. I&#039;d love to hear what some others think about this, that&#039;s just my view on it.

				Yea I think it would have to be an ounce or more for them to consider a controlled delivery. Unless it was like your 4th time getting caught, or if they had some sort of evidence on you. Obviously I&#039;m only referring to marijuana here, harder drugs would probably take less.

And even if there is some directive that officers shall attempt arrest on weight X or above, I would think that&#039;s the kind of thing that&#039;s subject to change given resources, heat from the public/press, etc.. As others have said, as SR gets more coverage, more suburbanites freak out, suddenly there&#039;s more pressure to bust someone, anyone, with a connection to the Road.

				With how little money police agencies have to spread across different areas of said policed areas, then grams or even oz&#039;s for that matter, I wouldnt even worry about.<br /><br />The amount of large scale illegal packages going through the system would surprise you. The only way i could see an agency ACTIVELY pursuing grams or an oz in the mail is A.) if they were extremely board(your town is super small or live in the sticks and they have nothing better to do) or B.) if you make it to easy for them lol IF they question you, you have no paper trail, anyone can mail anyone anything. Play dumb know your rights and don&#039;t admit to anything simple as that.<br /><br />I have seen friends get MULTIPLE love letters for kgs++ and thats all it ever amounted to.<br /><br />

It is then the job of law enforcement to PROVE beyond a reasonable doubt that YOU the person intentionally ordered or had knowledge of this package arriving, which is easy in some cases but most of the time is next to impossible unless the person is a complete retard. Im not here to give people reassurance i simple state the things you can pull right out of law textbooks yourself. In no way am i trying to tell him i know exactly what will happen, but i do know what experience has taught and showed me. If this was not true then anyone who doesn&#039;t like someone can simply mail them herb with no vacuum seal and watch them hauled off to prison. It simply does not work that way.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve never had a love letter then maybe you haven&#039;t had reason too, it all depends on if it has happened before at said address or if it is a known trouble spot. <br /><br />A love letter is by no means a &quot;your ok keep doing what your doing&quot; letter. It is most of the time Customs giving you one last chance to not ruin your life. Take it.

				It really depends on where you live.&nbsp; In the UK I&#039;m not sure how big of an amount would get you a police visit, but I&#039;ve received some customs love letters over the years even for amounts like 56g of weed.&nbsp; In the event of a seizure in the US you&#039;re likely to get a police visit for anything above an ounce of weed but it might happen with smaller amounts if you&#039;re unlucky or your local police are bored that day.&nbsp; Then there are countries like Finland with very strict customs and countries in Asia where even a tiny amount will get you a police visit every time.&nbsp; I would never use SR in Japan or Korea for example, there they&#039;d fuck you over big time for even a tiny amount if it got seized.

As for your question about, &quot;why you think an illegal act (PPT), prevented by intervenors (carriers/inspectors/cops), suddenly becomes a nonevent in the eyes of LE.&quot; Im not trying to imply that it is a &quot;nonevent&quot; sorry if it was taken that way, I am simply saying know your rights, when most people lose a package they INSTANTLY panic and assume the worst, just because a package is intercepted does not mean it is the end of the road, although damn close, one must be on top of there game. Either way EVERYONE needs to realize that in court it is the job of the PROSECUTORS to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that you are guilty, it is not our job to prove our innocence, it is simply our jobs to just show that what ever the prosecution is saying is a lie. This is college law 101, first year knowledge. Just like the notorious statement, its NOT what you know, its what you can PROVE. A first package being intercepted does not PROVE guilt but sure as hell looks that way, but like you said that is another topic and i had misread the question.<br /><br />ANY amount can allow a VISIT although possibly not prosecution, it depends what hilljack place you live in and wether or not deputy jimbob only has the fun of chasing local farmers stolen cows around town.<br /><br />Sorry again for my confusion of topic im not here trying to argue or give people a false sense of reality I just spew what I&#039;m learning in college. <br />

				You know what, Ecom123, I was in a bad mood when I wrote that. I didn&#039;t need to jump down your throat, and I apologize.<br /><br />I get aggravated with a trend of reassuring advice I see on SR which seems to be of the variety &quot;I did X and nothing bad happened, therefore there is no risk in doing X&quot;. I also wonder how many LE post on SR, and of course they&#039;re going to post reassuring bullshit rather than encouraging people to take precautions. Not that either of those apply to you - my frustration level is just running a little high as a result.<br /><br />Keep on keepin&#039; on.<br /><br />

				I completely understand and I agree. No offense taken though I should have read the question over again before i initially replied. I too am wary and do not like when people on here act like what we do is not a crime, I just choose to use the knowledge im learning to help calm certain people down a bit and show that there is some light at the end of the tunnel(although quite tiny) Panic is the worst thing someone can do when faced with situations we discussed, when people panic they make mistakes, in these times we must all be on top of our game.<br /><br />Cheers my friend

				NEVER become complacent. It&#039;s easy to get used to the beautiful simplicity of the Silk Road, and you start getting in the mindset that this is just like eBay, and no harm will come to you. I have been guilty of this line of thought myself a few times. Always assume that every order you make is going to get intercepted so that you are prepared for the worst. Keep in mind that if you have ordered internationally, regardless of the amount, you will now be suspected of drug trafficking, and I can assure you that this is far far worse than just getting caught with a gram of weed on your person. What if you&#039;re the person they decide to make an example of? So no, do not think that things will be all hunky-dory. Complacence gets people arrested. Your story should always be that someone randomly sent drugs to your house, and you had nothing to do with it. If there is any way that they can prove this to be untrue, you are fucked. You should have no financial background with BTC, your computer should be encrypted (if a package is taking an exceptionally long time, delete Tor from your computer just in case), and you should have no drugs anywhere in your house at all. Like I said, ASSUME that your package will be intercepted. This is better than assuming that it will reach you fine every time.
