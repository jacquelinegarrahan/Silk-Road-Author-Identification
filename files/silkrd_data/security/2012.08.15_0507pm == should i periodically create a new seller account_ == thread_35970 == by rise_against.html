				i know it would suck for feedback rating, but would creating a new seller account every few months be the way to go?

				It wouldn&#039;t accomplish much. Plus it certainly would not be the best way to lure in buyers. It would get expensive buying new accounts all the time and really is not necessary. So i say no.

				I don&#039;t think it would be a bad idea. Create a whole new online identity every year. Kinda like diapers. Gotta change &#039;em sometimes. <br /><br />There would be a few advantages to it:<br /><br />1) You look like a small time vendor on every account. That means you&#039;ll look like a smaller fish to LE lurking here.<br /><br />2) If you get busted, in some jurisdictions, you have to pay back all your profits. If they figure out you are behind seller account X, they might calculate your profits based on the amount of trades.&nbsp; However if you change account now and then, the real number will be higher.<br /><br />3) If you have different seller accounts, and you accidentally give away some personal information, it will be harder to put it all together to get a profile of you.<br /><br />Of course when you do this, you should not stop with one account on Tuesday and begin a new one on Wednesday. There should either be some overlap (both accounts active), or a small break in between (which means you can&#039;t sell in that period).<br /><br />There are also disadvantages<br /><br />1) You won&#039;t build a big track record<br />2) you might lose regular customers, unless you tell them you&#039;re switching account. However that is a security risk.<br />3) You&#039;ll have to pay the vendor fee again (although maybe you can work something out with the SR management)
