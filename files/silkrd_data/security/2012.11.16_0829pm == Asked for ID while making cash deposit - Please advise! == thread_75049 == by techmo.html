				Hi,<br /><br />So I tried to make a cash deposit at a bank today and the teller requested ID.&nbsp; This hasn&#039;t happened before so I wasn&#039;t sure what to do.&nbsp; First I told her my ID was in the car and she asked me to go get it.&nbsp; I then said it may be at home and that I would have to come back.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing I looked a bit sketchy during this conversation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think she would have recorded my info.. just had to confirm who I was.<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Should you provide ID when asked when making a cash deposit to an exchange?<br />2.&nbsp; Are tellers required to ask for ID for deposit over a certain amount?<br />3.&nbsp; Should I go back with my ID or try a different bank?<br /><br />Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				CVS sometimes asks for ID, usually for transactions over $100. It&#039;s pretty easy to bullshit the cashier, but sometimes you&#039;ll get a hero worker that won&#039;t do it for you without showing ID. I&#039;m not sure about the bank you visited, but you&#039;re right about one thing - they don&#039;t record it, they use it to verify the transaction. At CVS the register lists all open MoneyGram transactions at that specific location (most likely just you) and they use the ID to verify you&#039;re paying for the right transaction. Like I said, it&#039;s pretty easy to bullshit whoever is handling the transaction. Just tell them the name you used if they&#039;re hesitant to process the order and if they&#039;re not some douche bag they&#039;ll cut you slack. If not, just go somewhere else.

				In Canada I find RBC asks more than others they are brainwashed to ask, you don&#039;t need it I would use another bank and just state i don&#039;t have it with me and if the teller persists ask to speak with manager. It is not a bank policy but is at the discretion on the branch manager....they are god. Scotia hasnt been a problem yet

				Do not ever give your id. That is setting yourself up for getting caught.

				I&#039;ve done quite a few bitinsant cash deposits via CVS, and they were all over $200.&nbsp; They have never asked for my ID.&nbsp; If they did I would just ask them who else in the world would be paying my bills?!?! (I always tell them I&#039;m paying a bill, which is what it looks like) You can also tell them your license is suspended and they shouldn&#039;t give you any shit.. after all, who else is gonna pay your bills?! lol<br /><br />Only problem I&#039;ve ever come across is one dumbass lady that refused to type in the full amount (payment + fee).&nbsp; She insisted that if there was a fee it would be automatically charged.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally she called the actual store owner who was actually there (kinda sketched me out, but the dude was awesome).&nbsp; He told me that next time I should tell the cashier to type in the full amount instead of just the payment amount.... I was like, &quot;Ugh... I did, twice.&quot;<br /><br />It probably wouldn&#039;t hurt to show ID, because like others said they most likely don&#039;t record any info off it, but I always use a fake name and it wouldn&#039;t match up lol. No need for a fake phone number because I just tell them I don&#039;t have a phone.&nbsp; For the most part, they really don&#039;t care.

				Hi Techmo,<br /><br />While buying and trading BTC is either legal or untested under law in most countries, it is strongly recommended that you avoid using your real identity to buy BTC where they may be connected with a SR consignment - especially if you don&#039;t have the patience for laundry services. It is always best to have somebody else visit the bank on your behalf: connecting a deposit with a delivery or vice versa is enough for LE to turn your plausible deniability into deniable plausibility.<br /><br />In Australia, it is certainly not the norm for tellers to require ID for amounts less than $10,000 - the threshold at which anti-money laundering provisions take effect. Typically, the data field which would contain your name on a transaction is the same as that designated for an order or invoice number - you would choose one or the other.<br /><br />The optimist in me feels it is possible that banks may alter their internal procedures regarding ID from time to time. This may be an effort to bolster their legal standing in the event they are implicated as instruments to nasty business, or to strengthen internal control systems, or simply to have means for authenticating the depositor in the event of a dispute or error. There are surely other possibilities, too. In this case, it is likely that your identity is harmlessly stored in an obscure corner of the bank&#039;s transaction metadata and never seen again. Banks are unlikely to surrender information like this to LE - or video footage - unless it is explicitly subpoenaed/the subject of a warrant. <br /><br />I have no doubt that LE would be interested in monitoring BTC exchanges, but the extent of their power to have banks to collect information on their behalf without new legislation or onerous legal procedures is uncertain. Besides which, LE resources are limited enough that one does not expect they would devote these to investigating transactions that rarely clear $1,000 line or small-time individuals whom they would be unlikely to prosecute successfully.<br /><br />Best of luck. Hope to hear other views on this.<br /><br /><br />CO<br /><br /><br />(Some of my premature, skwarking panic about recent experiences in the bank is here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70684.0 )<br />

				**I&#039;m cross posting this experience to all the Bitinstant threads**<br /><br />Another successful Bitinstant - Moneygram client here. I did a few transactions earlier today and had the coins in less than an hour each time.<br /><br />Just use fake info like everyone says. You don&#039;t need to memorize anything other than the name/address you give Moneygram via the red phone. Seriously, it&#039;s that easy. You walk in, pick up the phone, follow simple instructions, tell them the amount, say your designated fake name/address plus a fake phone number you don&#039;t even need to remember, and that&#039;s it! Finally, go over to the cashier, tell them the name, pay the total, and sign the receipt. Done.<br /><br />Be prepared to be asked for ID at some locations. Calmly tell them your wallet is lost and that&#039;s why you are paying bills with cash in the first place, and they&#039;ll pretty much be forced to continue.<br /><br />It&#039;s not quite as easy as bank deposits, but there are advantages to this process. For one, drug stores are open later and they don&#039;t store their surveillance footage as long as banks, not to mention the shitty cameras and choppy DVR settings they use.
