				Same problem. Been lurking about the forums for a while now and feel I&#039;m comfortable enough to make my first purchase, went on blockchain this morning and no options for UK deposits.

				I hope Blockchain arent going belly-up, a handy tool for Uk btc buyers.. <br /><br />A thread was up yesterday claiming they was possibly scamming people, does anyone know if theres any truth in this? If they&#039;ve removed uk deposits its a fairly flawed scam attempt...<br /><br />Heres to a great 2013 on SR...<br />

				Tut after a few unlucky issues with pingit recently, was going to get some bit coins today; I&#039;ve noticed slowly but surely bitchain seems to be coming back up, still disabled for UK but at least its now showing and loading the web apps for the different methods, earlier today they were not even there.<br /><br />What other good UK methods do we have if bitchain doesn&#039;t come back for us?<br /><br />Been looking at BTCxUK and some guy on https://localbitcoins.com/ called craigemerson (who has 44 transactions, is at 100% and is doing 1btc at £7.89 ), seems like a great price but that site seems a bit bleh to me.<br /><div></div>Anyone tried either of these methods?<br /><br /><br />

				Is there a list anywhere for localbitcoins for vendors that people can vouch for? I use BTCxUK myself, but some kind of list could be handy for those that wish to stick to localbitcoins method.<br /><br />Pingit is not anonymous enough for me personally

				Pingit isn&#039;t anonymous at all&nbsp; but if you you use the anonymous feature on blockchain to send BTC to SR, I think its enough for small amounts of BTC. It was never designed for larger amounts of BTC.

				Seems to be back up now and working.<br /><br />The Barclays issue isn&#039;t with getting the bit coins but actually transferring funds into the pingit wallet, first few times worked well but the last two attempts didn&#039;t come through, stuck in Barclays&nbsp; suspend account due to not knowing where to go; should get that back eventually though as it appears to be a wide spread issue they are working on - if anyone else uses ping it i&#039;d recommend just going to the cash point and doing it as the pingit app is still going through some teething problems.
