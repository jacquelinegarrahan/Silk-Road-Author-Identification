				Hi guys,<br /><br />I want to connect to mtgox anonymously.&nbsp; TOR doesn&#039;t work because all the exit node IPs have been blocked.&nbsp; My only idea is to remote off an open wireless.<br /><br />Does anybody have alternative ideas to offer?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				That would work.&nbsp; You could consider that with the combination of a proxy and a MAC changer and you should be good to go.

				Private VPN, free wifi, or a hacked/cloned cable modem that gives you access to someone else&#039;s internet. I believe there are also private tor exits that you can find, which probably wouldn&#039;t be blocked by mt gox.

				I wouldn&#039;t change your MAC to get new IP&#039;s every time, your ISP will flag you, and they know what modem/household it&#039;s connected to anyway.

				You can connect to a VPN via TOR which means your external IP will be that of the VPN but if the FBI force the VPN to screw you over, all they get is the exitnode IP&#039;s that your TOR client was using.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how to do this, google around and you should find more info.

				You don&#039;t even need an open wireless. If you have Ubuntu/Linux there are many tutorials on youtube on how to run some simple programs to crack any wireless password in minutes, even the most encrypted. <br /><br />With MtGox I wouldn&#039;t even worry about it.<br /><br />Cops aren&#039;t going to go to extreme lengths with a deep investigation(contacting MtGox) if you&#039;re ordering a few hundred dollars in drugs.<br /><br />If you&#039;re ordering amounts that cops would find worth investigating throughly (thousands of dollars worth), then MtGox is going to require you to verify your account anyways.

				I am pretty sure WPA is still secure so the above comment is not 100% accurate.<br />If you can find a WEP protected network though then you are in luck. Download Bactrack (a linux distro) and install it on a CD or USB and boot your computer from that. Backtrack has a suite called Aircrack which you can use to break WEP fairly easily and quickly.

I tried to bruteforce a WPA network and left it running for about 2 days and still nothing so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s even possible to crack them using a bruteforce method. A lot of people still use WEP though so you can just drive around on a laptop and crack one using Backtrack to do all of your illegal bidding&nbsp; ;)
