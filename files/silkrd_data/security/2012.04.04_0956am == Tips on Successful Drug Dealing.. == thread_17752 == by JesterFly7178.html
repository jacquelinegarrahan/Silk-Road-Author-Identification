				Hello SR, when I was younger I used to deal yayo here and there but really didn&#039;t care too much about laying low or the law. I&#039;ve always felt the need and was addicted to the rush of dealing.&nbsp; Now as I&#039;m older and have a sanction like this with I&#039;m sure very seasoned players of the game would you care to share some tips that have kept you in the clear. Or share mistakes you&#039;ve made. I&#039;ve only been dealing weed. Thank you in advance.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				dealing IRL? a few rules i wouldn&#039;t break when i dealt. most are obvious but still doesn&#039;t hurt pointing them out. i used to sell coke and weed:<br /><br />1. don&#039;t deal from your house, car or your local pub/hangout - always get out of your hood. customers homes is usually best if you know them. if you don&#039;t know them take a big mate with you.<br />2. don&#039;t deal with idiots - any loud mouth muppet with a total disregard to subtlety is near enough certain to get you pinched<br />3. get a throwaway mobile phone for your customers. change it every 6 months or so. NEVER take 2 phones out with you - you get caught with 2 phones while you&#039;re carrying and you are fucked. throw away the whole phone as well, don&#039;t just get a new sim and use the same handset - you can get caught out on the IMEI number. turn your phone off when you can&#039;t be bothered to sell anything. this is especially true if you are selling coke.<br />4. once you have a customer base you are happy with do not take on any more customers unless they can be vouched for by 2 people you know well<br />5. don&#039;t arrange to meet 2 different customers at the same time and same place.<br />6. don&#039;t go on deals stoned - paranoia is a bitch that being stoned does not help.<br />7. when getting to meets park up at least a block away and walk the last bit - you don&#039;t need your car getting recognised.<br />8. don&#039;t tic. to ANYONE. mates are more of a pain in the arse to get cash off than customers.<br />9. if you have been given a bad batch by your supplier take it back as soon as you find out - you don&#039;t need your product being given a bad name.<br />10. when going to a strange place for a meet turn up early and case the place to make sure you aren&#039;t walking into a robbery/sting. stay out of sight until your meet turns up to make sure they don&#039;t have a couple of heavies with them to do you over. also keep an eye in the sky for CCTV<br />11. don&#039;t underestimate the &#039;enemy&#039; - it&#039;s only arrogant idiots that think the police don&#039;t know what to look out for<br />12. don&#039;t keep anything at your house - i used to pay a mate to keep my stash in a locked box round their house.<br />13. don&#039;t sell short weights<br />14. don&#039;t be late to meets. if you are going to be late send your customer a message as soon as you know you aren&#039;t going to be on time<br />15. make up a nickname for yourself just for your customers, just in case any of them take it upon themselves to start asking around after you<br />16. probably most important - if you go to a meet and something doesn&#039;t feel right GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE.<br /><br />and by the way - it&#039;s normal after dealing for a few months to shit yourself every time you see the polizei ;)<br /><br />i never broke any of the above rules and i managed to deal for a good 8 or 9 years. never seen the inside of a police cell :)

				Peace to all of the advice.<br />No matter how much temptation you have to &quot;sample&quot; your product, don&#039;t.<br />When I used to deal in college, I learned to buy from a completely different person for yourself or well, temptation can be a bitch.<br />

				I guess the real way to get rich quick is be a mega shareholder in all the big firms selling the usual prescription drugs that even feel like they were designed to get you stoned and addicted.<br /><br />I would ditch the dealing from a house part and hand your customers a a usb stick with all the info and software they need to buy online. Tell them your retired but there is this guy comes recommended. Tell them to learn how to use bitcoins. <br /><br />You meet nobody face to face. No neighbors wondering why 20 people have knocked before 6.00pm. No chance of customers getting arrested and offering up the dealer for a deal. No chance of masked men bursting in demanding the money and drugs with a warrant or without!<br /><br />I&#039;d say just sell online exclusively. That way your just a flag saluting average community member who only has a few friends around.<br /><br />Think of this way. Any dealer who has ten customers must have 500 who know or have heard of this venture. People talk and brag about drug use. But selling online people can wear tshirts with your name yet they do not know you and that is for the best really. <br /><br />You cannot sell drugs without people knowing and talking.<br /><br />The first thing you do when you know a drug is good is sing its praises and sing the praises of the dealer.<br /><br />And if the drugs are no good your name is offered up as untrustworthy. People get violent over bad deals and there is no resolve button in the real world - sometimes its just an irate customer who wants to kill you!<br /><br />Start up here is a lot cheaper than doing deals with people to use their homes.<br /><br />Neighbors would not know anything if you had your little production line with vacuum sealed bags and so on. You drive to different post offices or get someone to do that for you. Its still a risk but you have reduced the risk considerably.<br /><br />Go online.&nbsp; :)

				Both times I got popped was being in the car with weed. Even had it vacuum-sealed the second time; cop just lied his ass off. No one around my town have I ever heard of getting their door kicked in and shit for just selling buds, unless it was some major weight. Both my dudes got popped same way as me- driving around with weed. Though one of em had a key of yayo in the car and dipped on the cop when he tried pulling him over lol. Started flinging half bows out the window and he lost the cop. He got away and hid the key at his cousins. obv still got arrested for the weed. caught felony possession w/ intent to sell + fleeing and eluding @ high speeds. but he dodged a minimum mandatory sentence of like 7 years. Dipping on the cops ain&#039;t always a bad idea

				I believe a lot of good advice has been given. i would reccomend not stashing anything in your car or even driving around with it. If you do drive with anything, any weight just dont break 2 laws at once. your holding drugs so thats 1. keep the speed limit, be sober, be alert. i fucked up one&nbsp; time and it was a good lesson. not to say ive been perfect since that fuck up but id say i keep these things in mind much more.

				The first response to the post was GREAT! I would like to offer one a bit different.<br /><br />1. Do not drink alcohol or smoke weed or use your product PERIOD.<br />2. When meeting your connect, make it during the day as much as possible, if not make sure it is a place the two of you agree on.<br />3. For every customer you pick up, they must be a referral that they have known at least 5 years, preferably ten.<br />4. As Raoul Duke stated, be sure to have a phone for customers only, replace it between 3 and 6 months in case someone talked.<br />5. Meet customers at their home. If you can&#039;t meet them at their home clubs and lounges and restaurants are fine. Why?<br />6. I strongly suggest renting a car EVERY WEEK! If you are not smoking, drinking, or speeding THIS part makes you virtually invisible.

Dealing is not just something you can start and become a millionaire overnight. If you don&#039;t have good connections and can&#039;t compete with the other prices on SR then your best bet is to grow weed. You could make 2 thousand a month by having like 10 plants in your basement if you grow high quality weed and do your research.

				u should be good on security. honestly just just take a molly and run around be on the constant move thats all u have to worry about and just say molly to people and nothing else trust me the people that need it will understand and tell u to come back. and the main thing is once u have confirmed how much he wants just tell him to get his money ready and u will come back and just kinda walk off and then come back and do the deal really quickly its better than standing there and them counting there money people are stupid and will get u caught especially if there drunk but yea man 100 should be cake to sell. but i would cap them out at .125 instead of .100 because the area that festival is in theres gonna be alot of people there selling mints so u need to put more and just sell them for 20-25.

				another tip: get a fake id, which u can then take out insurance on, register a car under - rent hotels and pay for apartments with. if u need proof of a working history, u can have ticket stubs forged. Do all your dealings through an Alias of an alias, when shit hits the fan, you can remove your self and leave behind this old and rotten identity. Do this is another state than where you reside.

				IMO, selling 100mg caps of molly for 20 bucks is common, but unethical and greedy.&nbsp; I would cap at .120 and sell 2-for-$30.&nbsp; if ur gonna sell for 20 a pop, i think you need at least&nbsp; .160 in there so that the consumer actually rolls off their 20 bucks.<br /><br />again, i always hear people selling 100mg for 20, but come on....thats way over double your investment and won&#039;t get anyone over 110 lbs rolling

				How about Dead Drops<br /><br />Leave drugs in a one location<br />Get call from vendor telling you were they&#039;ve left money, or meet vendor. Tell them were the drugs are.<br />That way your not handling the drugs and if your keen you can do this without them even knowing what you look like.

				For big events, don&#039;t deal alone. Go with a team and come up with a system. I won&#039;t go into detail as to what kind of system but use your imagination, play it like oceans 11 with your focus on misdirection and damage control.<br /><br />There have been times where shit almost hit the fan and I get to watch it go down as a passive observer. It&#039;s a beautiful thing.
