				Hi I want to verify myself on mt gox because it would just make it easier to not have to wait every 24 hrs to send more BTC to SR. Is it safe to give them my real info? or is there a diff way to get around this.<br />Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Td

				Hi TD,<br />&nbsp;It depends what you mean by &#039;safe.&#039; You are no longer anoynmous if you give Mt. Gox your documentation. However, this will not even matter if you properly launder and shuffle your BTC.<br /><br />There are a few posts/threads regarding different methods of doing this. IMO, if you plan on transacting large amounts of BTC, use Intersango (less prone to following AML requirements) or use Bitcoin-OTC.<br /><br />Best,<br />Zeus.

To do this, you send random amounts of BTC to each wallet from your SR account.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bitcoin fog is a little more complex but does a superb job of mixing your coins.

				I&#039;d recommend shuffling your coins between a few wallets you&#039;ve created yourself then using Bitcoin Fog - it&#039;s quite easy to track coins across the network if you deposit and withdraw identical amounts so you might want to distribute the coins across the wallets, move them around a little then move them gradually into your Bitgcoinfog account - note that Bitcoinfog lets you withdraw the money in smaller amounts at random intervals, even when it&#039;s laundered your funds - this is the safest method of withdrawal in my humble opinion. Their commission varies between 1% and 3% (it&#039;s randomised so people can&#039;t work out you&#039;re using them).<br /><br />V.
