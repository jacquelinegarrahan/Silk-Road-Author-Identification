				My advice would be to buy now, and don&#039;t wait for the price to drop, cause it may not ever drop again! Also, look into Litecoins if you&#039;re looking for something more affordable. They have more than doubled since yesterday at this time, and with the rumor that Mt.Gox is adding them, they will skyrocket if it&#039;s true! <br /><br />Just me .02 BTC/LTC

				Best thing to do is buy now, because it&#039;s a fact the price is still going up today.<br />It&#039;s not at all a fact though that the price will ever go up again once it starts going down (assuming it would go down).

				Bitcoin prices are going up because people are holding them as a speculation they will go up. They will drop when new speculators stop coming and the first wave of old speculators sell, signalling all other speculators to leave the market.<br /><br />Probably be a while yet, follow the news, when all the news is bad new speculators might stop coming. And fuck the mass media, nobody cares about it.

				When I first joined SR in May 2011 one Bitcoin was worth less than USD 7 - let&#039;s make sure that we all invest in whatever cryptocurrency replaces BTC! Anyone have any thoughts on this?

If the U.S. Government takes a stab at bitcoin, the price increase will be so tremendous that gold will be meaningless. Speaking of gold, you could compare bitcoin to a lump of gold.<br /><br />Both bitcoin and gold are a limited commodity. What would make either one devalue? Inflate? It would take either a meteor of gold--or a spaceship of computers--to devalue either one, irrespectively. Gold will never go down in value. Why? Because it is a finite resource with mandatory technological value: it is a superb conductor--gold, silver, platinum... Other precious metals: every metal in nature is, in fact, a finite resource, and as our human intelligence and knowledge databases grow, we can computer and manufacture ever-improving electronics--for both security and philosophical enrichment: more math problems are being solved with supercomputers; weather predictions are getting better; The Weather Channel (TWC) is regular advertising for its End of Times series about &quot;it&#039;s not iff, it&#039;s wwwhen&quot;; Nostradamus is always hailed as a saint by speculators--because his shit is still being deciphered and interpreted... kind of like the Mayans... Incans... Aztecs... Sumerians... Romans... Greek... etc... <br /><br />..meaning the BOTTOM LINE is that EVERY CIVILIZATION HAS FACED SOME SORT OF NEAR-EXTINCTION EVENT. Their knowledge has survived, although incomplete and imperfect. The lesson here is obvious: we need to work with every culture and every idea to make it the idea that stopped Japan and Germany from being absolute world powers--and instead, mutual allies. Symbiosis is so much more effective than outright war.<br /><br />Warfare is wasteful. How do we stop the war on drugs? SR is the first step. How do we predict the bitcoin&#039;s future: by observing and making rational and educated guesses about it&#039;s current state and compare that with historical examples and analogies, until we get a model that fits the picture...<br /><br />Bitcoin will drop in price when bitcoins get scammed. When it becomes possible for bitcoins to be stolen, they are no longer secure. The other possibility is if we go to war, a cyberwar, and all our computers are destroyed. That would not necessarily devalue the bitcoin, not without wiping it out of existence, because its exponential growth in computer hardware AND value will not stop until it faces an extinction event.<br /><br />That is the purpose of money and economics. That is the purpose of physics, chemistry, politics, sociology, architecture, engineering, law enforcement, governmernment. To survive. To continue to exist, and prepare every subsequent generation--our genetic heritage, cultural traditions, and ideas--to pass on to the next generation our ever-improving security and survival techniques and methods. Our technology.

				I personally dont think they will drop. They make less and less every year so the price will only rise. I can actually bet that investing now in BTC, even for the short term would most likely yield some decent profit depending on how much you spend.

They may roll back a little, but they will never return to under 10 dollars. If they do, I will gladly pay YOU 10 dollars.<br /><br />Litecoin is being eyed off as an investment. It can be an investment, sure. But realize that your next holiday paid for by Litecoin profit will be to Florida and not Cancun.<br /><br />@ SS. That is &#039;my&#039; line.
