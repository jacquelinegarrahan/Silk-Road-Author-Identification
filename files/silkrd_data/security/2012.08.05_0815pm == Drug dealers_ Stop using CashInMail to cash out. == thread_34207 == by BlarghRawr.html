				If there is one big-red-target you can paint across yourself, it is cash in mail. CiM is absolutely the easiest way to get the attention of LE, and the easiest way to get caught by LE.<br /><br />Let me walk you through the process;<br />LEO requests a cash in mail deal.<br />Vendor accepts, gives address.<br />LEO sends appropriate amount of cash.<br />Vendor sends bitcoins.<br />LEO uses bitcoins with vendor to buy drugs.<br />LEO posts positive review.<br />LEO requests another cash in mail deal.<br />Vendor accepts, gives same (or different, doesn&#039;t matter at this stage) address.<br />LEO sends appropriate amount of cash.<br />LEO also sends a sting.<br />Vendor(or mule) goes to pick up cash, gets arrested.<br />If mule, mule turns on vendor.<br />If vendor, vendor is now fucked.<br />LEO search vendor&#039;s residence and computer.<br />LEO gets ALL kinds of evidence.<br /><br /><br />So again, drug dealers. Stop using cash in mail. Please, for your own safety. At a bare minimum, you should be making another vendor account that has 0% connectedness to your drug dealing account.

				I&#039;ve known some Tony Montanas back in my day and the one piece of advice they always were sure of is that LE cannot and I mean whatever the circumstances were, cannot let go of money so I don&#039;t know if your post is actually accurate but then again I said back in my day so that policy could have change.

				It is a shame we can&#039;t clone ourselves. Set up clones in different countries, one for CiM, one for procuring, one for packing, one for shipping.<br /><br />With a cyanide capsule in their teeth too. Radio controlled of course.

				Thankfully I dont live in America, but for this to work for LE where I am from, they would have to prove that the cash was connected to drugs.......<br /><br />If you are using cash in mail, and someone who is not connected to you or your drugs to collect then there is really jack shit they can do?

				Pretty sure bitcoins completely legal, as long as the CIM vendor is not selling drugs there should be no problems.

				I take more cash in the mail orders than probably anyone on here. My system accounts for this exact process and is very secure against it. every system has pro s and cons. BTC are very anonymous and unsiezable and have a bunch of other strengths however to buy large amounts of BTC and Cash out large amounts of BTC anonymously is very hard. It is almost impossible to do without using a bank somewhere along the way. I know of lots of people who send stuff through the mail. The only people I know of that have been busted had large amounts of cash going through there bank accounts. If we as a community could be more organized in helping buyers buy btc easily and anonymously and helping vendors cash out btc easily and anonymously the community as a whole would do better.

Do you have tips you&#039;d be willing to share?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I offer this service myself to vendors and do point out that the address to which the money is to be sent needn&#039;t be their home address. It can be a Post Office, PO Box or even that of a trusted friend.<br /><br />The idea that I would give up that kind of information strains the point of credibility (indeed after examining last night&#039;s threads you&#039;ll see even the threat of an automatic weapon failed to move me to give up the personal details of one such client!) It would amount to confessing to concealing the proceeds of crime. <br /><br />If the cash is monitored moving through the postal network this could prove problematic but the burden of proof would still be on LE to show that it was profits from an illegal activity, which of course it isn&#039;t as selling Bitcoins is perfectly lawful. <br /><br />The alternatives are withdrawing to your bank account or buying up precious metals from sites like Coinabul&nbsp; -working in a bank as I do I can tell you that large sums moving regularly through your account would raise a number of flags. In addition, while precious metals are a sound investment you may find liquidating them rather difficult. Cash is by far your best option IMHO.<br /><br />V. <br /><br />
