				I&#039;ve been sleuthing around lately and have read and heard claims of insiders in the DPRK and how they&#039;ve allowed some of us to access North Korea&#039;s private intranet. My question is wether or not anybody has any intel that they would be willing to share? If anybody can give info mainly on how to access the Kwangmyong in general it would be immensely appreciated.

				I wasn&#039;t aware this was possible but I will be watching this thread as I am highly interested to see what the results are. Do you speak or read Korean? <br /><br />Dude, I am a DPRK freak! I started studying Kim Il Sung about two years ago and have been fascinated with the whole nation ever since. I even want to take a trip out there but right now the general with the Chinese waiter&#039;s haircut is making things a little uncertain for me, plus its like $5500 entrance fee just to get into the country. I can think of a lot of better ways to spend that money right now.<br /><br />I hope you can find something, I would be very interested in getting into their intranet and looking around even though I hear its a lot of scientific (outdated) papers and stuff praising the leaders. How did you hear about this by the way?

				I&#039;m trying to find the article I had just read the other night. It had explained that somehow insiders in the DPRK were using wifi, and if I&#039;m correct, some sort of transmitters which hadn&#039;t yet been discovered; and using landlines also to gain access (wether it said bridging the connections together I can&#039;t remember). As soon as I find it I&#039;ll post it on here. I&#039;m reading articles now that are rebuffing the claims that people have access but I feel that&#039;s just ignorance.

				Ok here&#039;s a statement from one sect of hackers that claim how they&#039;ve penetrated DPRK&#039;s intranet. <br /><br />Statement is from pastebin: http://pastebin.com/4g44jfNF<br /><br />Trying to find the article which provided more light on the subject but I&#039;m afraid it was an underground news source which makes it more difficult.
