You are mistaken. Also, this is a very common misconception.<br /><br />Not only is ATA Secure Erase a proper way of securely wiping out the data on the HDD, it is also faster than any other method. I can tell you straight out that all of the above mentioned 3rd party tools are basically pointless, as you will achieve almost the same end result - only with a substantially longer execution time (actually it&#039;s going to be even slightly worse, not in their favor, for the reason mentioned below). There is absolutely no sensible way of restoring the data off a magnetic surface, once it has been zeroed out (overwritten with 0x00 - NUL bytes). The only way you could possibly &quot;try&quot; to do so - is with an atomic microscope and it will take months just to restore a few lucky bytes. So, you can consider this impossible, especially with the density, at which modern hard drives write data onto the platter surface. All what those tools do - is create an illusion, that you need to write random data over the current one, in order to be &quot;secure&quot; / &quot;protected&quot;. It&#039;s a gimmick based on hoax. Their obvious shortcomings are, of course, very long execution time and they are also NOT capable of erasing (wiping) things like &quot;bad sectors&quot; (blocks) - sectors, that have been remapped (replaced for the sectors in the reserved area). ATA Secure Erase can do that, on the contrary.<br /><br />There are 2 types of ATA SE: standard and enhanced. The latter is mostly found in the more or less recent ATA command set (after y. 2004). This is a hardware-based operation - thus being obviously faster, than anything software. However, it will not work on drives connected through USB.<br /><br />You can either activate this feature through a tool called `hdparm` on an unix-like OS or with a DOS app. called `MHDD`. <br />Overall, start your journey from here: http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/SecureErase.shtml<br /><br />On a side note: `shred` is only good for erasing files, not the whole disk. Also, if you do not plan on using ATA SE for whatever reason - then just using a tool called `dd` in a way of `dd if=/dev/zero out=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=noerror` is sufficient (but a bit slower than SE): its only disadvantage is going to be reallocated bad sectors (if there are any).<br /><br />

				+1 to everything 0x00 said. Also DoD 5220.22-M compliance doesn&#039;t really mean anything, it doesn&#039;t discuss any specific data sanitization methods... it doesn&#039;t even really cover data sanitization at all! DSS handles data sanitization for the DoD and they recommend overwriting followed by degaussing then killing the drive with either fire or a belt sander. But OP said that they&#039;re not in a position to do this so ATA SE will work great.

				From my understanding Secure erase does just mark the cells as empty.&nbsp; I also believe Secure Erase is recognized by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), as a way to meet legal data sanitization requirements against attacks up to laboratory level. <br /><br />I believe most Vendors on here would like something that would be a little better than this.

You are making an invalid assumption which leads you to building incorrect decisions / recommendations about the whole matter. SE does not just &quot;mark the cells empty&quot; - it physically overwrites every bit of data on the hard drive. Not only does it do so irrecoverably (by todays means), it also does more for security, than the aforementioned 3rd party utilities (as it also wipes bad sectors). This is a completely reliable, convenient way of securely erasing (wiping) the HDD clean. Trust me, when I tell you, that this is an established and highly recognizable way of data shredding in the field of professional data recovery and forensics. This is a standard that works and works well. There is nothing a laboratory can do, after this operation has been successfully executed. The only extreme way of possibly trying to recover tiny pieces of random data - is with an atomic microscope, but absolutely useless, as it will take a tremendous amount of time recovering a few bytes of data that you won&#039;t even be able to make sense of. No forensics lab is going to even attempt to do this, as the error rate is just ridiculously enormous. <br /><br />&quot;I believe most vendors on here would like something that would be a little better than this&quot; - that makes no sense in the given context, taking the said above into account. There has never been a documented case, where this type of recovery has proven to be feasible. They are already as safe as it basically gets, if they use SE.<br /><br />Here are some quotes from the &quot;Center of Magnetic Recording Research&quot; to back up the story:<br /><br />&quot;Q:&nbsp; What is secure erase?<br /><br />A:&nbsp; The ANSI T-13 committee which oversees the ATA (also known as IDE) interface specification and the ANSI T-10 committee which governs the SCSI interface specification have incorporated into their standards a command feature known as Secure Erase (SE).&nbsp; Secure erase is a positive easy-to-use data destroy command, amounting to “electronic data shredding.”&nbsp; It completely erases all possible user data areas by overwriting, including the so-called g-lists that contain data in reallocated disk sectors (sectors that the drive no longer uses because they have hard errors in them).&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Q:&nbsp; Is secure erase approved for government security?<br /><br />A:&nbsp; Secure erase has been approved by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Security Center1.&nbsp; In general data erasure techniques when used alone are approved by NIST for lower security sanitization (less than secret) since the data can be recovered at least in theory&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Q:&nbsp; Is any data left after a secure erase?<br /><br />A:&nbsp; Investigations at CMRR at UCSD have shown that a single pass secure erase at lower frequencies results in no remaining data signals and a second erase reduces this signal only slightly more.&nbsp; The resulting data signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the magnetic drive head is below that required to recover data using a disk drive channel1.&nbsp; The only recorded signal left in these experiments is a small amount of highly distorted track edge recording which is extremely difficult to recover data from even if the disk is removed from the drive and tested on a spin-stand.&quot;

Of course, current DOD standards no longer accept the over write technique for classified information. <br /><br />However, the 1995 and 1997 editions of NISPOM did.&nbsp; It included a table from the Defense Security Service&nbsp; titled &quot;Clearing and Sanitization Matrix&quot; which did specify numerous ways of handling all sorts of media to including hard disks. But, as of the June 28, 2007 edition, &quot;Overwriting is no longer acceptable for sanitization of magnetic media. Only degaussing or physical destruction.<br /><br />If I remember correctly it was the 1997 edition where the &quot;seven pass&quot; specification came from. <br /><br />I&#039;ll admit that I may be a little outdated on this.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s been about 12-15 Years since I&#039;ve worked in the field.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is an interesting read:&nbsp; http://www.infodelete.com/data_remanence/encyclopedia.htm#Feasibility_of_recovering_overwritten_data

This means, that there is NO REASON to do anything else, but a single pass with ATA-SE.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When it comes to ATA disks, however, I believe BEWTs pretty much have played out their role</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Obviously.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m not ignoring the established facts.&nbsp; But, all too often what is fact today is not tomorrow.&nbsp; Especially in the area of security.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then why on earth would you rely on something as vague and obsolete as the technology from 1996??? I urge you not to seed any more confusion and to give up the straw man argumentation. We are sharing knowledge here and I&#039;m sharing (for the benefit of others) what I have researched and therefore can definitely back up (and have done so). Let&#039;s settle on this, as it&#039;s just too obvious now where the truth lies. If you still have doubts - I will provide a few finishing paragraphs:<br /><br />(taken from http://www.anti-forensics.com/disk-wiping-one-pass-is-enough-part-2-this-time-with-screenshots)<br /><br />Sans Computer Forensics on Magnetic Force Microscopy<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">“The basis of this belief that data can be recovered from a wiped drive is based on a presupposition that when a one (1) is written to disk the actual effect is closer to obtaining a 0.95 when a zero (0) is overwritten with one (1), and a 1.05 when one (1) is overwritten with one (1).<br /><br />This can be demonstrated to be false.”<br /><br />“In many instances, using a MFM (magnetic force microscope) to determine the prior value written to the hard drive was less successful than a simple coin toss.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory by Peter Gutmann (35 pass wipe originated from Mr. Gutmann)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">“Any modern drive will most likely be a hopeless task, what with ultra-high densities and use of perpendicular recording I don’t see how MFM would even get a usable image, and then the use of EPRML will mean that even if you could magically transfer some sort of image into a file, the ability to decode that to recover the original data would be quite challenging.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, yes, this is an urban legend in our times. The person responsible even takes it for one.<br /><br />More links:<br /><br />http://grot.com/wordpress/?p=154<br />http://www.springerlink.com/content/408263ql11460147/<br />http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5749/how-can-i-reliably-erase-all-information-on-a-hard-drive
