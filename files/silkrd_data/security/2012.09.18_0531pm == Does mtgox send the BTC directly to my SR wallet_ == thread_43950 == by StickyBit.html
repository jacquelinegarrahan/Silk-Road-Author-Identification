				Just a question. I want to buy some bitcoins. When i use mtgox and transfer money to them via BAnk transfer, do they send the BTC directly to my SR Wallet or do i have to send it to another place before? Is there any other option to get BTC but mtgox?<br /><br />Thanks in advance

				Normally i used to buy UKASH and exchange it then butr the fees became too high (15%) So i am looking for a way to makae it via Bank TRansfer.<br />Can anyone recommend me such a &quot;mixing service&quot; to not transfer it from mtgox directly to SR( PM maybe).<br />Or just another service to buy BTC using bank transfer,

				This is what I do:<br />1) In the clearnet, get bitcoins from mtgox, no need to take any precautions. Always use mt.gox without tor.<br />2) Through tor, make an e-wallet at http://blockchain.info/. Always access this using tor.<br />3) Create an anonymous bitcoin address in blockchain.info, and send the bitcoins to this address from mt.gox. This will pass the coins through blockchain&#039;s tumbler before depositing them into your e-wallet, leaving no trail.<br />5) Send them from e-wallet to silk road account.

If you&#039;ve clicked the option to fund your account with a bank transfer and it didn&#039;t ask you to verify, then you don&#039;t need to verify.&nbsp; It won&#039;t give you that funding option if you need to verify first.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Dammit, if i want to make an Euro Bank transfer i need to be verified or trusted at least. Otherwise i can omly make a transfer to a japanese Bank and the tell me this:<br /><br />If you plan to do a EUR transfer from Europe, we strongly encourage you to send money via the Euro Bank Transfer deposit option. It is a much cheaper way to deposit, however it is only available to accounts that have a &quot;verified&quot; or &quot;trusted&quot; status.<br /><br />I also have the option to use OKPAY, CASHU or Liqpay....does these need to be verified? Damn man this really sucks.<br /><br />Does anybody knows another option to get BTC into his SR wallet without to need to verify?

				If you are in the EU, I would search the forums on how to do what you are asking.&nbsp; But in the US, I went to BitInstant.com and selected cash transfer and just put in my SR wallet address as the address to send the Bitcoin to (they will also send just to an Email addy) and then took the receipt to my local Walmart and paid with cash.&nbsp; This sent the money to BitINstant which converted the money into Bitcoin automatically and then the Bitcoins were forwarded to my SR wallet.<br /><br />Now that I know the process a little better, I would go through Coinapult ot Blockchain as someone has suggested to further anonymize the transaction rather than having Bitcoin going straight into SR wallet.<br /><br />I was going to do a bank transfer to; but the more I read about it, the less attractive it seemed and the less anonymous it appeared than other methods.&nbsp; There might be some quick and easy way to do a bank transfer, but I have not come across them yet.<br /><br />Good luck-
