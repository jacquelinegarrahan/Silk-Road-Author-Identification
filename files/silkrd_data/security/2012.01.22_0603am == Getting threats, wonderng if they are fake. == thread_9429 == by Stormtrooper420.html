				I got a message from a user stating<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;this will be your only warning<br /><br />I have a bot that will post your name and address here on the forums everyday, it can register new names by itself and change its Tor identitiy by itself.<br /><br />Your name and address will be posted daily here and on the hidden wiki and also cp sites on the clearnet.<br /><br />I have your name and address from my auction that you purchased from.<br /><br />This goes into effect in 3 days unless you delete all your posts and never post under stormtrooper again.&quot;<br /><br />I was calling out a vendor as a scammer and I feel thats who it is and I am not really too worried about it (especially because I didn&#039;t use my name or address} I have only purchased from 3 different very trusted vendors. What I am wondering is if it is even possible to do this??&nbsp; ??? thanks!<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

I&#039;d post their username here too.<br /><br />I&#039;d call bullshit on having your name/etc (if they really did and wanted their threat to hold any water they&#039;d mention exactly what they are when they contacted you rather than just alluding to knowing it), but it&#039;s easy to make judgement calls when you have no personal stake in something so at the end of the day you have to go with your own gut.

				This person is shoveling BS by the ton.&nbsp; Let&#039;s break it down.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;I have a bot that will post your name and address here on the forums everyday, it can register new names by itself and change its Tor identitiy by itself.&quot;<br />&nbsp;-- So you&#039;re telling me that this person has cracked the CAPTCHA for SimpleMachine&#039;s bulletin board, most likely for all other CAPTCHA algorithms in use today, and they are hoarding this solution for themselves?<br /><br />&quot;Your name and address will be posted daily here and on the hidden wiki and also cp sites on the clearnet.&quot;<br />--I&#039;m pretty sure that if I start posting a random person&#039;s address on the clearnet, that random person will have the authorities find me, and then I could probably be sued me for libel and/or harassment.&nbsp; As long as the threatened posting remains on SR-related sites, you probably don&#039;t want to go down the legal route.<br /><br />&quot;I have your name and address from my auction that you purchased from.&quot;<br />--They have *a* name and address.&nbsp; So do I; phone book&#039;s full of &#039;em.
