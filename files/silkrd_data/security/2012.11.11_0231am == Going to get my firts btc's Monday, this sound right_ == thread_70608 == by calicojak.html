				So I&#039;m a newb to all of this but I have been researching over the past few days and understand how to obtain my HTC..Here&#039;s my plan......I have already set up a mt. Gox account, so Monday I will use bitinstant to fund my mt. Gox account by going to 7-11 and basically funding the bitinstant account?? Then purchase coins on mt Gox and move them to my Sr wallet........Sound about right?<br />Thanks for taking the time

				Just make sure the 7-eleven takes cash and its not a money gram where you have to use a debit card.&nbsp; Some people would say to filter your coins through other sites first, depends on your level of paranoia and how much you ultimately are sending.&nbsp; Also, you may want to wait for the site to actually come back up before doing it..

				My favorite way is walmart to bitcoin fog to...... No id required at all. Just go to the service desk fill out the blue moneygram form and pay with exact cash. so far has worked flawlessly

				Another way of doing a cash deposit with bitinstant is at CVS. thats how i&#039;ve always done all mine, just go to any cvs and there is a red money gram phone near the cash registers somewhere and just pick up the phone and follow the instructions and pay at the counter. the first time requires you to talk to an operator but after that its a breeze.. by the time I get to the parking lot i get an email about the transaction&nbsp; &nbsp;;D
