				I&#039;m sorry if this isn&#039;t the right place to post this question.. I am new to Silkroad, but I have yet to set up a bitcoin account.. I am wondering if someone can direct me to one that is reputable? I was looking into using Dwolla, is that a good option? I am so confused by the whole bitcoin process, and it seems like every site I look at needs my bank account number, and I am always a little nervous about giving that information out.. Any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; :)

				Yeah, fuck that.<br /><br />You see, you want to make this whole process as anonymous as possible brother. That means none of your bank account info, no ID, no personal info, etc etc<br /><br />If shit hits the fan and you&#039;re using Dwolla, you&#039;re going to be up shits&nbsp; creek without a paddle.&nbsp; Not to mention; Dwolla is fucking SLOW! Way faster (and safer) ways to obtain BTC while keeping your identity anonymous. <br /><br />Try GB:&nbsp; get-bitcoin.com&nbsp; if you&#039;re looking for amounts smaller than 1k... Over 1k, they want identification (for fraud prevention purposes obviously).<br /><br />Fill out the information on that main page and select your method of payment. I use cash deposit at Bank of America; no ID required. Create a fake email account (if you haven&#039;t already) and use that email address to fulfill your GetBTC order. Once you deposit the cash to their account at whatever bank, send em a picture of your deposit slip and voila!, within 24 hours (usually 6-12 or less) you&#039;ll have BTC in your wallet. <br /><br />When you send the picture of the deposit slip; look around the forums for a tutorial on removing meta-data from images. Make sure you scrub the picture clean before sending it to anyone. Most cameras write meta-data to the file that can help identify who owns it, copyright information, camera model, tracking image use etc. This data will be written to all the files from the camera, so be sure you scrub that to ensure that there is NO way they can trace it back to you, should anything go awry. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve used Get-BTC for over 3,500$ total and have been impressed every time. If you&#039;re new and don&#039;t want to get hustled by the MoneyPak traders charging 10%, I recommend GB for a good first experience.<br /><br />Be cautious, stay safe. <br /><br />Much love

				How do you send cash using that method fumanchu? Just walk into a bank asking to deposit cash to a certain account? They won&#039;t ask for ID at bank of america/Do you need an account there?

				I&#039;ve done several transactions through Boa. <br />You don&#039;t have to show any id.<br /><br />under name put getbitcoin llc<br />and enter their account number<br /><br />Thats it.&nbsp; Just save the receipt and take a picture of it and then take a screen shot of the picture and send it in.&nbsp; <br />Getbitcoin then sends the funds to your wallet.&nbsp; <br />

				Thank you for the replies, but I don&#039;t live anywhere near either of those banks.. Are the other methods of payment on that site just as reliable as going into the bank? Like buying a prepaid visa gift card?
