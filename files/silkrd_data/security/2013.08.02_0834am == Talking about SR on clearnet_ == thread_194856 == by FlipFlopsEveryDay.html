				I&#039;m curious.&nbsp; I see all these people on 4chan/reddit openly discussing SR, talking about about what they have bought or plan on buying.&nbsp; How much danger are they in?<br /><br />When I&#039;m on reddit, if the poster is outside of the SR sub, sometimes I&#039;ll check out of curiosity if they&#039;re using a main account or a throwaway.&nbsp; I try to warn people not to do that with main accts/clearnet, but they get all cunty with me so I leave it now.&nbsp; Some I would suspect are using accounts that are never accessed through tor, so nothing linking them to sessions with SR use. <br /><br />Recently started getting on 4chan again.&nbsp; Normal SR comments are vague, not incriminating.&nbsp; Saw one guy post about &quot;lol i get shit tons sent to my house,&quot; then saw it deleted a few minutes later.&nbsp; I know if you say shit on there about shooting or suicide, you&#039;re pretty much gonna get a knock on the door.<br /><br />So what&#039;s the deal with all these knobs I see? I can&#039;t even bring myself to make simple comments on the SR sub with my main account, even if the comments had nothing to do with drugs.&nbsp; I just wouldn&#039;t want my account on any SR users/vendors radar.&nbsp; How much danger are they in?&nbsp; I have no earthly idea where the line is that can&#039;t be crossed if you wanna still use the road.&nbsp; I try and keep myself so far from that line, well, I don&#039;t even know where it is heh.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I guess i should clarify. How much danger are people in when they simply discuss purchases from SR over regular connections, not tor.&nbsp; I&#039;m just trying to figure out if I&#039;m in the right when I warn these people or not.&nbsp; Last time I did, the dude just went off on me about him not being an idiot.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think that they would be fine unless they had accessed an account through both tor and clearnet.

				Using drugs is not a criminal offense in every country. In my country, dealing drugs is a crime, but you will not get into trouble for personal use or detention of small amounts for personal consumption. Decriminalisation, while not being legalisation, is a step further that several European countries did (i know of it for Portugal, Belgium and Holland, but there are other ones). Real problem is that states cannot decide for themselves anymore and if one attempts to legalize then he will get kicked in the balls by US world dictators who think they know better than everybody what&#039;s good for all countries. If drugs were legalized they would harm a lot less but althrought US government understood it, US decided users must suffer because US needs funds for their secret operations and to take over other countries by arming rebels. <br /><br />When the most powerful country becomes the biggest cocaine dealer, there is no big chance for legalisation : conflict of interest is evident.<br /><br />All that to say that i can freely speak about my psychedelic experiences and my SR orders without legal risks. Some governments are less close-minded than others...<br />

				titicacanari makes a good point but decriminalization (even legalization) of using drugs is a different legal term than decriminalization of possesion.<br /><br />If a person is bragging about buying drugs of SR on his man reddit account he is an idiot, plain and simple. It takes just one Redditor who is a cop in that area.

				If you&#039;re at all concerned about security (which it sounds like OP is), then it would be wise to maintain separation between your clearnet presence and your underworld activities. <br /><br />Don&#039;t talk about SR on Reddit from any account that you&#039;ve ever accesed over clearnet. If you want to post on Reddit about SR, create an account over Tor specifically for that purpose, and choose a username that cannot be traced back to you. Same goes for any other clearnet site. If you must discuss SR on clearnet, just make sure the account you&#039;re posting from cannot be traced back to you.<br /><br />You&#039;re doing a good deed by warning others of their insecure practices. If they want to be douchebags about, that&#039;s their problem. They must not be concerned about their freedom

				People who talk about their SR activities on clearnet are not playing with a full deck; OR are very young and inexperienced in life. <br /><br />These people will be the first to go when &quot;authorities&quot; decide to crack down on our kind of thinking/commerce that transpires here.
