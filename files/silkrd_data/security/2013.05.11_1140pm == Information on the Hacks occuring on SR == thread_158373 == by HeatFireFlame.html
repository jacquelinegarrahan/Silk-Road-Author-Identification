				Hi all. Look i know this may have been said before but some people obviously were not reading the posts as attacks and stealing accounts are still happening. <br /><br />Im sure everybody knows that over the last few weeks a massive Ddos has been occurring on SR. Im also sure a lot of you are worried about the getting logged out for no reason troubles etc. Now i asked a mod about the getting logged out screen and i was told that it was a security measure. However i still would not enter my password for any login that has only a verification code of 3 letters. I advise you to do the same.<br /><br />Just to bring this to all of your attention as well. I have seen in the last day 5 or so vendor accounts that have been hacked. Who knows how widespread this is so please use extra caution when ordering , Search your vendors name into the forums and check if there is anything posted etc ;ANY login screen that asks for you pin as well Do not enter it as it is a phishing site, Most of you will be saying DUH but I&#039;m telling you there have been a good few long time vendors who have fallen for this so exercise extreme caution. <br /><br />These attacks have been changing and re-occurring in different forms ever since the original massive Ddos a week or two back. I have no idea if it&#039;s A government agency or a group of hackers, but either way something needs to be done. It&#039;s starting to get out of control here. I mean how much power do we and the mod&#039;s have over it? If we want to keep our community, we will need to do something. <br /><br />Look there&#039;s plenty of threads on how to stop the attacks blah blah, But seriously Watch who you order from, Watch where you login, Watch everything, You cant trust anything now. <br />Please feel free to list any accounts compromised already.

				Thanks for clearing that up scout.<br />Yes I have seen 2 vendors who willingly supplied their PIN&#039;s at the login page. Scout i have seen the 2 you&#039;re reffering to, But i think it&#039;s more , I saw another thread with a further 2 vendors that were hacked as well. (or provided their pins to phishing pages) <br /><br /><br />The religious things, Was that the ones about im not selling poison anymore, And then something about biting their own wrists and throwing them self into a secluded river then saying a hail mary?&nbsp; people do some weird shit. <br /><br />Cheers for clearing it up scout.

				Yeah, none of us know what the hell those two vendor pages are about or why they have such strange messages on them.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what happened there, but it wouldn&#039;t make sense for scammers to do that because scammers are here for money, and simply changing vendor profiles to read weird shit is not going to make them any richer.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is really no excuse for vendors providing their passwords and PINs to phishing sites, but I want to make clear that it was not a &quot;hack&quot; - passwords and PINs weren&#039;t hacked or guessed or brute forced, they were entered into a phishing site.&nbsp; Everyone should know better than to login to a page that is not at the following correct url:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />If there is ever a legitimate message from DPR to vendors, it will be signed with his PGP key.&nbsp; All other messages from SR claiming to ask for donations, offer investment opportunities, or offer some kind of &quot;upgrade&quot; to a user&#039;s account are scams.&nbsp; All a person needs to do to be absolutely sure of this (if the horrible grammar of the message wasn&#039;t enough to raise flags) is to know how to check the validity of a PGP signature.

I kept logging in and trying to change my password until I got it changed.<br />I did not get logged out even 1 time after that. It was like someone was logging in so it was booting me out. <br />Now i never entered my password anywhere else, and I use the same link on the same comp every time. Ever since I have not entered my password if the logging screen has only a small ammount<br />of letter or numbers. <br />In this time one of my customers sent his address to me in a private note link, when I went to check the link it had been read already. I also had some domestic mail go missing <br />these where the one&#039;s that the address where not encrypted. This Is very strange because I pack everything well and vac seal everything as well. <br />There is a defeated hack going on and it is likely cops because of the missing mail.I refunded all orders 100% so don&#039;t go calling me a scammer This is real. <br />I am a vendor it would be a bad move for me to just spread FUD.<br />I think there is an operation going on and they are just sitting on a fair few account without changing anything so they can gather info like address and your bitcoin address. <br />In my opinion every SilkRoad user should change their passwords now and only use their vendors original pgp public key to encrypt all comm&#039;s and all address. If the account has been compremised <br />then the hijacker wont be able to read your messages or address.

				I can never seem to login when the captcha is only 3 numbers... at first I thought it was my fat fingers, but now I&#039;m not so sure. not a big deal though... I just refresh and the normal one comes up.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying the 3 captcha is insecure etc etc.. just it doesn&#039;t seem to like me :(
