				Hey there!<br /><br />I have the luck to have two tickets for Tomorrowland 2012 in Boom, Belgium.<br /><br />A friend of mine and I are going, and we would love to do some MDMA up there. Now my question is, what you think about taking the MDMA from somewhere in the EU to Belgium (we&#039;re going by car). As responsible drug users, we would take 1 dose for each, that means 2 doses (2x140mg=280mg).<br /><br />And buying MDMA from a unknown dealer near/at the festival is not an option for us. We don&#039;t want to spend much money for getting (probably) crap or low (or even over) doses.<br /><br />Is it worth it? I mean the risk? It&#039;s not a quantity you could call &quot;for selling purpose&quot; or something. And we would not take any drugs weeks before the festival (in case of police controls).<br /><br />Do you think there are controlls at/near the festival?<br /><br />Thanks for the help!

				One thing is to get INTO the festival, and another thing is to come from somewhere in the EU to Belgium. :)
