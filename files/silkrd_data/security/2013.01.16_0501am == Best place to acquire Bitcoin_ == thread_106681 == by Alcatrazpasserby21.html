				Hey everyone! So I recently got sent here by a friend who has used this website a few times and I downloaded Tor and the PGP and all that good stuff to be able to use the site. I&#039;m just wondering, what is the best site for me to get Bitcoin? I&#039;ve never bought them before and getting caught into a scam really is not what I&#039;m trying to do. Also, how much does a Bitcoin cost in USD? <br /><br />Apologies if this question has been answered before, but I haven&#039;t been able to find my answer anywhere on the forum.

				Hello, mtgox is the biggest bitcoin exchange.&nbsp; Most places depend on them for the most current exchange rate.<br /><br />To purchase BTC you could use localbitcoins which will locate a seller in your area.&nbsp; You can also purchase BTC using Western Union from my vendor page (see the link in my signature).&nbsp; Good luck.

				Dude, seriously, read around the site a little and get some info. Different people will have different opinions and it varies largely by which country you&#039;re in.<br /><br />Are you in the U.S I&#039;m guessing?<br /><br />Anyway, you can use an exchange, such as MtGox or various others (anyone know if Intersango is still around?) but they obviously charge a fee and can take a little while. <br /><br />You can purchase direct from people on SR who sell BTC for various types of other currency (paypal, money orders, cash in the mail, etc).<br /><br />There&#039;s BTC-OTC (over the counter) where you deal directly with another person directly, cutting out exchange fees. This way you&#039;re sending money to an individual so I suggest reading about the correct way to authenticate and verify etc. and how to check status etc. before diving in. There was a guide somewhere in the forums on doing this (it&#039;s sticky-ed so should be easy to find).<br /><br />It really depends on the level of anonymity/security you want, how you want to buy them (cash/bank transfer/paypal/western union, etc) but there&#039;s lots of info around on it.<br /><br />Good luck :)
