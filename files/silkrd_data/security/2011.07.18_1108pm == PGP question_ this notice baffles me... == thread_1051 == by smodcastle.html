				About every other person I attempt to send an encrypted message to, PGP gives me this message:<br /><br />It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named<br />in the user ID.&nbsp; If you *really* know what you are doing,<br />you may answer the next question with yes.<br /><br />I always give em the okay, but I thought I&#039;d ask some peeps that understand the system better, what exactly does this mean? And is it that big of a deal? Thanks! ~smod

				It means you haven&#039;t signed their public key with your private key so it&#039;s not sure if it has been tampered with or not.

				hmm ok, i apologize. i actually kinda knew that much, only i thought each person was solely responsible for signing their own key. i know HOW to sign a key, in as much as i know the steps- im just not sure what it means once its done. i guess what im saying is i dont know what that really MEANS to me. so to clarify: a.) i sign THEIR key to make sure it hasnt been tampered with? what would that mean that it is tampered with? and b.) how important is it that i sign their key and why? thanks. ~smod

				Someone knowledgeable correct me if I&#039;m wrong but: the whole signature issue regarding PGP keys is only pertinent if you are getting the person&#039;s key from a public place where you&#039;re not sure THAT PERSON put it there or not?&nbsp; So, for example, if you download a seller&#039;s PGP key from SR, you KNOW that&#039;s the right one, because it&#039;s on their account.&nbsp; As long as you don&#039;t *change* that key, the seller can always read your messages and you have 100% confidence it&#039;s them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Signatures and verification come in when I might go to the Tor project and want to talk to a programmer and their key is up on some blog out in the nether regions.&nbsp; I download it, it has their name on it, but I don&#039;t have any idea who put it out there.&nbsp; So, I have to get them to verify it the first time I use it with them.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I&#039;ve always understood since 1998 or so when we first used PGP.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that correct?

				The warning is not a big deal, just mean you have not marked that you are sure you know them.<br /><br />signatures are useful if you want to prove you sent something. Webpages and accounts can get hacked, getting someone else&#039;s private pgp key is much harder.
