				interesting concept and just hitting the news now<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1c62gw/zerocoin_is_a_new_cryptographic_extension_to/<br /><br />http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/04/12/zerocoin-add-on-for-bitcoin-could-make-it-truly-anonymous-and-untraceable/<br /><br />Many users of the crypto-currency Bitcoin see it as the first fully anonymous and untraceable currency. It’s not. But with the addition of a clever piece of code called Zerocoin, it could still fulfill that dream of truly private payments.<br /><br />Zerocoin, the work of a a group of cryptographers at John Hopkins University who plan to present their system at next month’s IEEE Security and Privacy conference in San Francisco, offers an extension to Bitcoin that would make the task of identifying Bitcoin users or tracing their transactions nearly impossible. If adopted by enough of the Bitcoin network, Zerocoin’s inventors believe it could become a fundamental upgrade to Bitcoin’s code, integrating itself into the currency and solving what many see as privacy flaws in Bitcoin’s current implementation.<br /><br />“A lot of people have tried to make systems of anonymous digital cash over the years, and they’ve failed. Bitcoin has almost made it, but it’s come just a little short,” says Matthew Green, the computer science professor who designed Zerocoin along with graduate students Ian Miers and Christina Garman. “How do we get it that last 10% of the way? It’s taken us nearly two years to come up with the answer, and this is what we’ve got.”<br /><br />To understand Zerocoin’s significance, consider Bitcoin’s strange properties as both one of the most private and most public payment systems ever invented; Bitcoin is private because it doesn’t need to be issued or stored by banks, and can be spent on the Internet with cash-like advantages, such as never requiring the user to reveal his or her name or register an account. But Bitcoin is also public, because every transaction is documented by everyone who uses Bitcoin and can be traced to the user’s digital address, part of the function of the currency that prevents fraudulent transactions.<br /><br />“You can feel like you’re private using Bitcoin, but there are going to be companies like Google and Facebook and [Google-owned ad firm] DoubleClick looking at the data and pulling personal information out of it. There may be already,” says Green. “It’s not wrong to be paranoid about privacy when it comes to Bitcoin.”<br /><br />Plenty of Bitcoin users seem to believe that the currency offers enough privacy even for illegal activities–It’s accepted by drug sites like Silk Road, as well as criminal hackers and even some who claim to offer Bitcoin-based contract killings. But for a Bitcoin user to prevent transactions from being tied to his or her identity–particularly at the dicey moment when he or she turns Bitcoins back into dollars, yen or euros–requires extra steps such as sending Bitcoins through a “laundry” service that mixes their “dirty” Bitcoins with lots of other users’ coins and issues them random, “clean” ones. Using those laundry services, such as Bitlaundry, Bitmix or Bitcoinlaundry, means trusting the service to sufficiently randomize the coins they’re giving out, and not to track the coins or steal them.<br /><br />Zerocoin is designed to offer the same privacy and untraceability properties as one of those laundry services, but without the need to trust any potentially shady entity; As with Bitcoin, the user would only have to trust the currency system itself.<br /><br />The Johns Hopkins’ team’s system would work by allowing any Bitcoin user to convert a Bitcoin into an anonymous token–a Zerocoin. Zerocoins would theoretically mesh seamlessly with the Bitcoin network, could be traded and spent in the same way as Bitcoins, and could be redeemed for a Bitcoin at any time. But thanks to some mathematical tricks, a Zerocoin would be both unique–it couldn’t be forged or duplicated–and yet also be impossible for an observer to identify as the same Zerocoin between the moment it substituted for a Bitcoin and the moment it was traded back for one. (For the technical details of how that’s possible, see the Johns Hopkins team’s full paper here or embedded below.)<br /><br />The result would be that Bitcoin would essentially have its own, built-in laundry system. “In fact, you can think of Zerocoin like the world’s biggest laundry — one that can handle millions of users, has no trusted party, and can’t be compromised,” Green writes in a blog post explaining Zerocoin posted Thursday. “Once a user converts her bitcoins into zerocoins, it’s very hard to determine where she took them back out. Their funds are mixed up with all of the other users who also created zerocoins. And that’s a pretty powerful guarantee.”<br /><br />Getting Bitcoin users to adopt Zerocoin may not be easy. To have its intended effects, nearly all Bitcoin users would have to add the Zerocoin code, which the Johns Hopkins researchers are releasing next month, to their Bitcoin client software. In the mean time, the system could be adopted incrementally, Green says. But until it’s integrated into the Bitcoin protocol, Zerocoin would require third-party services to act as issuers of its anonymizing tokens, introducing some of the same trust problems that currently exist with laundry services.<br /><br />Zerocoin also takes about 50 times more computational power than Bitcoin, which could cause delays and glitches in the system. But on that front, Green argues that the code only needs to be honed by the Bitcoin community to increase its efficiency.<br /><br />Green is realistic about the difficulty of getting users to trust a new, complex cryptographic system, but believes that adoption of Zerocoin is possible. “It will take time to convince people that these new techniques are safe,” he writes in his blog post. “We hope to be there when it happens.”<br /><br />If Zerocoin is implemented, it could lead to questions about the ethical and societal implications of truly untraceable digital payments. Anarchists and libertarians have long dreamed of perfect payment privacy as a means to avoid taxes, thwart laws and even destroy the government. As I wrote in my book on the cypherpunks and WikiLeaks, This Machine Kills Secrets, the anonymous payment concepts created decades ago by inventor David Chaum led to proposals by “crypto-anarchists” such as Tim May and Jim Bell for systems that would untraceably buy and sell national security secrets or fund political assassinations.<br /><br />Green says that creating the tools for crypto-anarchy isn’t his intention. He tells me that one of his graduate students, Ian Miers, even hesitated for a time to work on the Zerocoin research for fear of its political implications.<br /><br />But ultimately, the current version of Bitcoin has serious privacy flaws that Green and his fellow researchers believe need fixing. Without the use of Zerocoin or less trustworthy laundry services, all payments made with Bitcoin are in some sense entirely exposed. “This isn’t about hiding transactions from governments,” says Green. “It’s about the idea that if I buy something at the drug store, that used to be between me and possibly my credit card company. With Bitcoin it’s between me and the whole world.”<br /><br />“Everyone’s going to look at this as trying to facilitate the trade of weapons or drugs,” he adds. “But privacy is important. And people have a right to it.”<br /><br />
