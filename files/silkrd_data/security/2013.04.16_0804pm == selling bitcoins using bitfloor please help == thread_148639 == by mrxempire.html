				hey guys. Since the BTC prices have dropped considerably within the last week, I think i&#039;m going to try my luck and invest about 1000 in bitcoins. I am going to buy them using bitfloor and keep them in my bitfloor account so that it is completely legal. I know you can sell your BTC using bitfloor, but how do you turn it into actual money afterwards? Is there an option to click somewhere and fill out a slip that you take to the bank? I&#039;m sure there has to be a way, since there would be no option to sell your BTC using bitfloor if you couldn&#039;t take the money in your account to the bank afterwards. Please help. +1 and many virtual kisses to whoever gives me the best answer

				The only option I know of to get cash is to have Bitfloor do a direct deposit USD to your bank (perhaps this only works in the US??). This requires that you set up ACH with Bitfloor and send them a copy of a picture ID. The option to do this is on the &#039;Withdrawal&#039; page.&nbsp; When I set up with Bitfloor, I could not find this option, but then discovered that there are two buttons toward the top of the Withdrawal page. The default is BTC, which is why you don&#039;t see any $ option. Just click the USD button, and all of the process is laid out.<br /><br />This will take a while while Bitfloor sets up your automatic bank transfer but once you have it set, I&#039;d expect that it would be pretty efficient. I&#039;m curious abotu what fees Bitfloor charges. One of my issues with the whole bitcoin system is that, right now, eveyrone grabs a piece of your coin everytime you transfer anywhere.&nbsp; Bitfloor would at least be only one step each direction. This assumes you don&#039;t mind sending ID - if you are just speculating, then why not? Even for Silf Road use, a pass or two through Bitfog should suffice as long as you&#039;re just a casual user.&nbsp;

				hmmm. If I have to give a photo I.D to bitfloor, perhaps I should make a new account just for trading, since I use bitfloor to transfer BTC into my SR account as well. It probably doesnt help that my bitfloor username is Mr.X either hahah. thank you sir or madam for this useful information I am giving you many kisses right now

				Once in your bitfloor account go to withdraw. It took me awhile to find it, but there are two buttons at the top USD and BTC. If you click the USD it takes you to the ACH form.<br /><br />Looks simple enough, I&#039;ll have more to say after I do it. I&#039;ve never bought off of SR so I could probably use my existing accounts. I&#039;ll still make new ones anyway.

				for the record, my bitfloor username isn&#039;t really &quot;mr.x&quot;, but it is something suspicious along those lines. I just created a different account to do my legal trading anyway, just to be on the safe side. let&#039;s hope bitcoins quinuple in value now

				Well.. I guess we&#039;ll have to find another way to get bitcoins now that bitfloor is gone. It&#039;s pretty funny it went down right after I talked you into it.

I&#039;ve argued in other threads that I see no potential for LE to expend the resources necessary to trace casual users through complex bitcoin transfers - others may have differing views, but that&#039;s mine. I feel safer and less exposed to LE scrutiny by using standard and perfectly legal bank transfer than I do by running around with wads of cash making anonymous deposits at WalMart. Just my opinion.
