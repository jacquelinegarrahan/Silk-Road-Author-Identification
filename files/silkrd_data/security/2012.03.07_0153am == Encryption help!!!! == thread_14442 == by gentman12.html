				hello everybody. I&#039;m reasonably new to the silk road. Ive found about it from a close friend.&nbsp; My question is do really need an encryption keys. My friend said he started to use encryption when first started but phased out of it as he found that it wasnt needed. I know it is recommended with messages and personal information between the buyers and sellers but i feel maybe that it is redundant. Any thoughts and personal opinions.

				you are doing something that is likely illegal where you are, so you should only use encryption if you want your info to remain private. Always assume that someone is trying to take down SR, because they probably are. Also assume that everything you do here is stored in their db unencrypted. I know they say the address form is encrypted and deleted as soon as sellers marks in transit, but my dad told me I would grow up to be president too, and I am starting to think he just wanted me to feel better about myself.

				The address isn&#039;t stored on SR encrypted its stored in plaintext on a mounted encrypted drive, which has a remote chance of being helpful, if LE decide to power down the machine after seizing it without first dumping the RAM into a forensics laptop.
