				Sorry if this is a repeat topic, but ... hard to search for.&nbsp; So why do you buy bitcoins?&nbsp; Not the real reason of course.&nbsp; I realized I don&#039;t have reason lined up, would be great to get some ideas flowing, maybe some links where you could use them on legal stuffs.

				You won&#039;t need to explain it to anyone unless explaining your purchase of bitcoins is the least of your concerns (as in you get charged with possession)... but in 6 months, they&#039;ve increased in value by ~600%.<br /><br />You&#039;re investing.&nbsp; Anyone who doesn&#039;t think that&#039;s reasonable is fucking insane.<br />

				Nice to see you still around, Toby :)&nbsp; At least you don&#039;t have to feel bad about going through hundreds of bitcoins and never making any money from them because you&#039;re always buying drugs with them... lemme tell you, there&#039;s nothing like that to make you feel like a dirty addict, lol.

				Hey, SS. :)&nbsp; You, too.<br /><br />I dunno, man. At least when you&#039;re buying, the coins go up, the prices come down. You pay the same. I&#039;d throw in if there was a coin crash, but this doesn&#039;t look like some spike to me. And doubling from $15 was completely do-able (obviously). Doubling to $70? Doubtful.<br /><br />Now watch me eat my words. Yum.<br /><br />

				Hey, just google frigging bitcoin.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a legitimate business or two struggling to make a profit with this new-fangled currency.&nbsp; I think I read this in Wired.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I finally get arrested for all the shit I&#039;ve learned how to do since discovering Tor, I hope the fuck to at least make that prosecutor work for his money.&nbsp; Buying bitcoins isn&#039;t a crime, and it isn&#039;t even circumstantial evidence that a crime was even committed.&nbsp; Maybe it will take one of us getting busted and tried for that to come out (and believe you me, I&#039;m not stepping up for that one!), but buying rolling papers is more incriminating than buying bitcoins.&nbsp; And, that ain&#039;t sayin&#039; much.

				In December 2012 I&#039;ve bought about 5 BTC from some dutch website for 50€ and there was a bug in their system which made the transaction get through multiple times so I ended up with 35BTC. <br />Still new with the BTC thing I politely emailed the owners about this and what to do and their immediate response was something in the line of return the BTC right NOW scumbag, you don&#039;t know who you&#039;re dealing with, we&#039;re all pro-hackers, we&#039;ll find you. <br />My initial intention was indeed to return the BTC (hence, I&#039;d emailed them) but after such a response I decided to keep the BTC. Keep on looking guys, keep on looking.<br /><br />I wish I&#039;d saved those. Those 50€ would have been worth 900+€ right now but of course I&#039;ve spent it all lol.
