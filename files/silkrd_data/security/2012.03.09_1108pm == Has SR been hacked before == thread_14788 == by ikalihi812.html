				You need to use virtualization to isolate your tor server from your http server, etc. that way even if one is compromised it won&#039;t be able to disclose your real IP.

Offer a variety of prizes for the various levels of disruption and penetration that you are worried about. Increase the value of the prize over time. A group with a lab and a private [Tor] network would be ideal if you really want to explore the possibilities.<br /><br />You may also want to consider the possible HUMINT operations through normal access to your site.<br />
