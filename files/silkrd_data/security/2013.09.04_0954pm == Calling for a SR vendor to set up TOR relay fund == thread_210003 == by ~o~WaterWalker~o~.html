				To make life easy for a lot of people to support the TOR network, what about a savvy security chap sets up as a vendor and takes orders of donations to set up more and more TOR relays?<br /><br />I know there are some nice posts on it, and I am half tempted to just run some servers as relays in my home (not sure it that is a great idea), but I think it would be very popular from buyers/vendors/admins to throw some bitcoin at someone who focuses on setting up relays either in their home or on hosted services.<br /><br />They don&#039;t have to give big details for security sake, but just a running total in their vendor page of how many relays they have running, ballpark costs, and of course they get a fee for their trouble.<br /><br />Hell I might even do this if I read up on it... I have the starting capital and the time and technically this isn&#039;t illegal but people don&#039;t really want shout to the world they are doing this<br /><br />thoughts?&nbsp; would 10 or 20 relays even make a difference?&nbsp; What would that cost a month?&nbsp; How popular do you think this could get? 100 relays?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Intersting idea. How would the &quot;savvy security chap&quot; prove that he set up a relay using the money that the other person provided?

				The relay list is public. Everyone can just look it up.<br />Taking donations for this via SR would be pretty stupid though as it would make the legal act of receiving donations to run tor relays an illegal thing because SR gets its share of every donation and by that one is knowingly supporting a criminal organization.

				Suck me off and I&#039;ll give you a server... lol<br /><br />On a serious note, read up on torproject.org, some &#039;sponsors&#039; are running hundreds of servers.<br /><br />I think your idea could work though. I&#039;ve already thought about it in the past. One way could be to charge a subscription to access a bridge relay. These addresses are kept private if you want.

				And you think TOR is actually anonymous? By using it you&#039;ve successfully narrowed yourself down to about 1% of drug deals and 0.01% of internet traffic.

				I was thinking of doing this too as I&#039;m pretty ok with all things linux and have a bit of experience in that area. <br /><br />I was thinking more of making a listing for &quot;Buy TOR relay for 1 year with free setup&quot; kind of thing.<br />I buy a vps for&nbsp; 1 year with&nbsp; BTC, setup the relay and pass on the credentials after it&#039;s setup and running. <br /><br />Could be expensive however, 1 year vps up front could be at least $120 for decent spec.

				Thanks all for the discussion..&nbsp; &nbsp;it really is a brainstorming of sorts<br /><br />the torservers.net donations I will check out..&nbsp; <br /><br />but- what if DPR used some of the vendor fees to either set up more relays or donate to torservers.net?&nbsp; Even if he added a new fee for it would that bother everyone?&nbsp; (I know the fees are high already from what I hear, just brainstorming)<br /><br />also, there are SOME legal items on SR so just because something is sold on SR doesn&#039;t mean it is illegal besides skirting sales tax, etc..&nbsp; but donations are free of sales tax anyway so it would be a legit anonymous way of contributing<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Torservers.net actually spread the donations amongst other non-profit organisation so they are not running all the servers themselves<br /><br />How about we call on some vendors to make a percentage % donation of sales to torservers or some other relay group?? Even to tor project itself!

				The Chaos Computer Club also runs Tor relays and will take donations for it. They&#039;re based in Germany and run relays in several European countries. They&#039;re a large group of whitehat hackers and very trustworthy.<br />If you want to donate for their relays you first have to write a mail to anonymizer@ccc.de however.

				Well if DPR + team are already running relays, they&#039;re not exactly going to tell everyone now are they?<br /><br />Besides they would definitely be running a VPN and private bridge network of some sort just to access SR server assuming they don&#039;t have physical access.

				I&#039;m going to go a bit against the stream here, but I think the very first person that should donate is DPR.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the users&#039; or the vendors&#039; task to provide for a working infrastructure.&nbsp; That&#039;s exactly what Silk Road is charging commission for!<br /><br />Now, don&#039;t get me wrong. I think DPR is great, but sometimes people here forget that he&#039;s making millions of your drug purchases. Which is legit. But Silk Road is not delivering the service, it&#039;s getting paid for.<br /><br /><br />Thing is, I can very well imagine that DPR is taking measures to help TOR&#039;s network. Would be nice though to hear about it...

IMO they provide a valuable service. Your traffic and activities are encrypted while on SR which seems to be true. A built in tumbler when transfering in and transfering out coins.&nbsp; Although from recent studies and research in regards to Bitcoin tracing that tumbler is not enough to keep your coins anonymous nonetheless it&#039;s still a feature of the site. Also the enormous task of keeping this hidden service hidden if you will. That in itself could easily take up 50% of the DPR or the other developers time up. Could SR do some things better? Sure just like anything else but let&#039;s keep in mind what we&#039;re doing here. It&#039;s not exactly Ebay even though with the ease of purchasing drugs and the overall friendless amongst ppl here SR almost resembles it.

				LOL supermarket analogy, yeah I see your point but unless the door is closed or the long entry queue is too unberable then you still go in.<br /><br />Even if police are out the front investigating a broken window - you still might enter but you might slow and turn to look first.
