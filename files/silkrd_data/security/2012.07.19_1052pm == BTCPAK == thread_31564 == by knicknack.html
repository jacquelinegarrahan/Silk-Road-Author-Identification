				Has anyone used this service to exchange BTC&#039;s onto a green dot money pak card?<br />Doesn&#039;t appear to be safe on the surface.<br />Anyone tried it?

				Not sure if this is very useful as I haven&#039;t personally tried it yet (but plan to very soon). Here&#039;s my 2cents:<br /><br />It does seem legit to me for two reasons:<br /><br />1) its referenced as the main method of bitcoin -&gt; moneypak on the bitcoin wiki. Not sure how safe that page is, but it seems legit in that its for legal use of bitcoins.<br /><br />2) the guy running it has a great rep within the bitcoin community. Just like here, I&#039;m sure scammers can make themselves appear reputable when they&#039;re not. But what else can you expect?<br /><br />I plan on using the service with the smallest amount first, then making bigger transactions if everything goes smoothly.<br /><br />Anyone know of similar services? There&#039;s a lot of trading on the bitcoin forum which will probably be what I end up doing also. Best to diversify your withdrawals, IMHO.

				Thanks Ted.<br />I did some background on the service and though I agree it does sound legit my concern is that you need a green dot card to load the USD onto once you&#039;ve cashed out the BTC&#039;s<br />To do this green dot need all your shit.<br />Name, addy, ssn. The works.<br />That&#039;s the part I don&#039;t like.<br />If your a bitcoin miner it seems you&#039;re unlikely to have 2c a day to cash out certainly not 2k not even $200.<br />Couldn&#039;t LE be running this, get your info and stop by for a warm friendly chat?

				Ahh, now I see your concern.<br /><br />That&#039;s a problem inherent in using MoneyPak (the idea of needing SSN, addy, etc) to cash out. Even if you get a reloadable card somehow without your info ;), you still gotta go to an ATM to get the cash. Even if the guy running&nbsp; BTCPAK is legit and not LE, that third step is susceptible to de-anonymize you.<br /><br />Been racking my brain trying to figure that one out. I got a method, but its by no means elegant. In fact, its kinda a pain in the ass. Makes me think BTC-&gt;MP-&gt;cash is not the best route.<br /><br />Any thoughts from some experienced members? Or should we keep this to ourselves so we&#039;re not doing &quot;their&quot; job for them?<br /><br />Also (not trying to hijack your thread - but sorry) but could someone, ANYONE, give me their thoughts on my question of posting free stuff (no strings attached - no shipping/etc) on the offers forum without having a vendor account yet (plan on getting one real soon). I want to generate some buzz first but don&#039;t want to piss anyone off/get banned.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8436.msg350793#msg350793
