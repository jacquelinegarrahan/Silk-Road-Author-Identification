				Good stuff.&nbsp; Never talk to cops is always rule one to staying out of a cage.&nbsp; Talking to the cops can only incriminate you.&nbsp; They know this and this is why when pulling you over they ask all kinds of questions you are not to answer like:&nbsp; Where are you headed, where are you coming from, did you know you ______________.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also never let cops in your house or open the door for them.&nbsp; If they had enough to arrest you, they will come in with a warrant and arrest you.&nbsp; If they need enough to get a warrant they will knock on your door and ask questions until you give them enough information.

				Have you ever watched 48 hours? the detectives are always saying &quot;this is your only chance to come clean and for us to help you&quot; then they spill their guts hoping for their help, instead, they just handed the detectives their case on a silver platter. Watch that show, its a perfect example on what NOT to do..<br /><br />I think i&#039;ve only seen one or two people keep their mouths shut. and one of them totally walked.(even though they pretty much knew he did it, just couldn&#039;t prove it)

				Bump... The more you talk, the less you&#039;ll walk. Unfortunately when the pressure&#039;s on it&#039;s easy to crack. I got told once when I was young and being drilled by a cop about being in a stolen car, &#039; you can lie to me but if you lie in court it&#039;s perjury&#039;. It worked and I admitted to driving it. I&#039;m a lot older and wiser now.

				the only reason cops ever want to talk is to get enough info to arrest someone. they dont want to help you, or anyone else, all they want to do is make an arrest. never forget this. <br /><br />if they are asking you questions, its because they dont have enough information yet. the second they get enough information, they slap on the handcuffs. and dont think they wont make up information they need as they go along. want to see a cop lie? go to court. they lie on the stand all the fucking time.<br /><br />talking about exercising your civil rights in a situation like this is one thing, but having seen far too many civil rights violated by the police, i can tell you that it rarely works out in your favor. cops do what the fuck they want. stay out of their way if you want to stay safe and free.

				If you are contacted by law enforcement of any kind, and you did not initiate the contact yourself (or maybe you did, sometimes), say the following (or a variation thereof):<br /><br />&quot;If I am under arrest, please tell me on what charges, and if I am not, I wish to go freely on my way.&nbsp; I refuse to consent to a search of my person, property, vehicle, or effects without a valid search warrant.&nbsp; I wish to remain silent, and to have my attorney present during any questioning.&nbsp; I wish to speak to my attorney before I refuse or consent to a breath, blood, or urine test.&quot;<br /><br />Please know that simply remaining silent is not enough (here in the USA) due to new Supreme Court precedent.&nbsp; Yes, you must speak and communicate your desire to remain silent, remaining silent alone will not cease questioning.<br /><br />Law enforcement can and will legally lie to your face.&nbsp; Lawyers for the state are technically barred from lying to defendants, but as you know, that probably won&#039;t stop them.<br />

				They use routine questions to trip you up as a &quot;foot in the door&quot; if you will.&nbsp; It starts with &quot;where you headed&quot; and ends with &quot;can you step outta the car&quot;.&nbsp; This is not everyone&#039;s experience I&#039;m sure, but if you are a young white male, a black man, or brown; they want to put hand cuffs on you generally.&nbsp;

				1. Wait&nbsp; :( if we are posting on a public forum, then we are not keeping our mouths shut.<br /><br />Security analysts, whether CIA or Homeland Security or FBI or IRS or &lt;endless string of authority&gt;, are required by both their job description and their ideology to read these posts. Prosecuting attorneys probably spend some of their time trolling for rare thoughts to gain better profiles or each and every one of us. Do you see the level of PsyWar in which we&#039;re now competing? Open your eyes to what&#039;s really going on... but don&#039;t stop opening them. Just as Tor has many layers of routing encryption, life has infinitely more complex layers.<br /><br />2. Security Analysts and Analysis<br /><br />A lot of what we say and do is input for intelligent computer programs. The output depends on the human aspect of programming. It is much easier to search for explosives--and the list of nitrogen compounds or chemical terms essential for securing and manufacturing--and drugs and destabilization (threats to national security). Before the computer program can perform an intelligent search, a human has to read these messages. They have to understand how we think and perform in forums. <br /><br />If you compare this forum with that of a woodworking forum or gardening forum, you will see that the dynamics do not vary much. There is always a social group that will develop a kind of leadership. The more knowledgeable members stand out, earning respect for their wisdom, and demonstrating leadership. What is different about this forum, is it contains members of organized crime--although through Rothbardism&nbsp; and not through blood rites or cultural traditions. The crime organization is Anonymous: anonymous criminals that are evading taxes and conducting illegal businesses. For certain authorities, we are enemies of the state. When you realize the level of complexity you are dealing with when you operate on the Silk Road, then you will realize what is at stake. <br /><br />There is much more than profits or personal freedom at stake. It is liberty for one and justice for all. I am speaking not only to Americans, but to every red blooded human alive and well--able to think and do for those less fortunate than ourselves.<br /><br />3. Human Learning<br /><br />I have stirred up a lot shit and come off as a bottom feeder to some intelligent members here, community members, long-timers. The point I have been trying to make is about how we learn. We learn from mistakes. Mistakes are what teach us the most about a situation. &quot;Don&#039;t talk to the Cops&quot; tells us not to divulge information beyond who we are (personal identification) so that there will not be any incriminating evidence against our individual identity. If you cannot be linked back to this website, then there is certainly more freedom in what we say and do here.<br /><br />So, one thing I might suggest is to begin thinking more like a prosecutor, more like an investigator. What would it take to stop Silk Road? What would it take to put every bad mother fucking vendor in prison? In a cage? Dank and dark, so spoiled with disease that no one will ever survive....<br /><br />4. Enemies of the State<br /><br />If we are all portrayed as enemies of the state, somehow different from a law abiding human demographic, then it will be easier for Silk Road to be taken down in the inevitable event of capture... Remember, however, that even if the servers are captured, or even a single vendor, that through the pirate lifestyle of the Silk Road--deleting messages, using GPG for EVERY COMMUNICATION that might reveal personal identity, and generally staying on top of the game (THIS Human-Computer-Human GAME)--there are limits to authoritarian power. We have invested time into securing our personal identity and personal liberty, but there are deeper mechanisms at work here. When you realize that, then you will see how revolutionary the Silk Road and BTC is becoming.<br /><br />Enemies of the State, like bin Laden... That&#039;s a scary classification. To clever investigators and politicians, that is an accurate and legal title to hand out to anyone on the Silk Road. The title is also very accurate in light of our technological advancements in criminal techniques--and it will remain criminal until Americans (or any culture) get educated about how crime works... because it is either too profitable for LE to change the current model of ignorance and enforcement or it is too expensive (personally or organizationally) to get over the learning curve. Open Source never sounded so dangerous, but that&#039;s what it is. It has created a stumbling block for national security.<br /><br />America now faces a possible war with North Korea. One thing America is good at when it comes to war is propaganda. Imagine the possibility of the Obama Administration, and/or the next administration(s), begin to cash in on the black market that is the Silk Road. I&#039;ve mentioned in another post about the price of cocaine and its relation to security with regard to the War on Drugs. It is too profitable for the outright and immediate legalization of drugs for politicians and LE commissioners to adopt and amend. Crime warlord of Mexico and Colombia exist because America keeps the price so high... a 5000% increase in value due to trafficking risk as compared to production and actual fuel costs.... sometimes more.<br /><br />Do you see how the true enemies of the state are revealed when we observe more and more information? This is the information that prosecutors and investigators are not paid to think about. Their only mission and task is to catch bad guys, not think about Right and Wrong. They are foot soldiers in a War on Drugs, fodder for the machine that is Corruption.<br /><br />If you want to sidestep the label of Enemy of the State, then you need to invest your time and money in education and personal security. That is the first step in changing America for the best. The second critical step to surviving in a hostile market is to avoid being physically hostile. ALWAYS use nonviolent means to acquire your personal wealth.

				Never talk the more you say the more you are likely to trip yourself up. You don&#039;t have to be nasty or combative either. Refuse politely. <br /><br />Also, never consent to a search of your person or property. It amazes me how many people consent to a search when they contraband and then it is dam hard to challenge a search. When you do refuse politely be clear that they may not search.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they come to your door don&#039;t answer it but if for some reason you do talk through the door. Don&#039;t let them in. They will use plain site and for their safety loopholes to search as much as they can.<br /><br />Likewise don&#039;t step outside your house either. <br /><br />

I always turn my interior lights on<br /><br />As soon as I see those red and blues light up, my hand goes up to make sure every inch of the inside of my car is illuminated I&#039;ve always heard cops appreciate this gesture as it makes it that much easier to see who and what is in the vehicle, it also puts them at ease and lets them know you at least care about what they may be thinking or feeling during a traffic stop. It also shows you&#039;ve got nothing to hide, which leads me to...<br /><br />2. I always keep the visible interior of my car as spotless as possible<br /><br />No wrappers, no packages, no clothes, no loose change, no loose cds (if anyone even still listens to those), no fast food bags, no bags from Wal-Mart or Target, no backpacks. If I have any of those things on me, I throw them in the truck. Now my trunk is an absolute mess from the 9th level of hell but no one has bothered to look in the trunk in 12 years. I think it was SleepyEyes (can&#039;t remember his exact user name, the fellow that is the ex-cop who was also in Afghanistan) that said something to the effect of &quot;The police feel that if your car is messed up, the rest of your life is probably messed up too&quot;. I agree 100%. I also make sure not to keep anything suspicious visible in an area I know I will need to reach during a traffic stop, like the glove compartment.<br /><br />&nbsp;I worked for a manager that would hire candidates based on what the interior of their cars looked like, no kidding. And what was funny is he was usually right, the people with the messed up cars or dirty car interiors didn&#039;t last longer than a few months on the job (because they either stopped showing up or were too incompetent) while the people that made an effort to keep their car clean, even if their car was older, were a better breed of worker.<br /><br />3. I don&#039;t make a move and I don&#039;t speak unless spoken too<br /><br />I keep my hands on the wheel, I look forward until he approaches my door and I don&#039;t try to get my insurance ready or DL ready before hand, I wait to do those things until they come up to me and ask for them. No sense in needlessly moving around and making them falsely think I&#039;m hiding something or put them on edge. I also don&#039;t volunteer information, I agree with the poster who said earlier &quot;keep your answers short and vague&quot;....there is no need to blabber on about whatever. They don&#039;t care. And everything I say starts with Sir.<br /><br />Its amazing but a little common sense goes a long way. Since I&#039;ve implemented the above I&#039;ve been pulled over plenty of times at night but only received 1 ticket in a 9 year time span and not once in those 9 years has the conversation even remotely drifted to &quot;you mind stepping out of the vehicle&quot; or &quot;do you mind if I look around your vehicle&quot;. I know my advice is no guarantee of results but my thinking is if I do everything I can to make the officer think I&#039;m an average Joe and not a threat, who loses in this scenario? Nobody.<br /><br />And I do have a question, why is it people think they have to open the door to their home when someone knocks on it? I&#039;m always amazed at the controlled delivery questions because there exists a basic assumption that no matter what else happens, you&#039;re going to be opening the door....to me it would be far better to not answer the door than to take your chance with a potential controlled delivery.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Number 1) is a good tip. That could def prevent a number of things. I have never been asked to get out of my car either. Nor has an officer ever asked to search my car.<br /><br />Keeping your car clean probably helps like you said. People are influenced by first appearances. LE is no different.<br /><br />I have no idea why people feel a knocked door must be answered. No one comes to my home without calling first and I don&#039;t answer the door if I an not expecting anyone. Not because there is anything illegal in my house (there isn&#039;t) I just value my privacy. But anyway, I think people are debating what to do in the worst case scenario.

Also, every cop I&#039;ve met know how to use a slim jim--and often has one in their car. It&#039;s a public safety issue if there&#039;s a baby trapped in a locked car. That sort of scenario. So, I don&#039;t think this is a great way to go.<br /><br />The advice from karensupreme is pretty awesome. It&#039;s solid information, anyway. The closer you look to a successful member of society, the less scrutiny you receive. Watch Cops, and it&#039;s obvious why people get preferential treatment--meth and crack heads, dope dealers, and fuck ups are usually easy to spot.

				It&#039;s usually not actually illegal to lie to a local law enforcement officer (if it is, it&#039;s a misdeameaner) but if you&#039;re talking to the Feds, you can get a 10 year sentence for lieing to them. If they are at your door, and you haven&#039;t opened it yet (buy a peephole) I wouldn&#039;t open it. They can bang on it all day long and I wouldn&#039;t open it. <br />Cops also ask you questions that they can easily check out, once they know that you&#039;re lying, they know you&#039;re lieing over SOMETHING, which just makes them MORE curious. <br />Cops can do a &#039;safety&#039; pat down for weapons, but they are not supposed to be able to go through your wallet, your cigarette pack, etc. although they WILL DO EXACTLY that if you are in a &#039;sketchy&#039; neighborhood. Also if you are a white guy in a black neighborhood, or a black and a white guy driving around. They know you&#039;re there to SCORE. <br />Be polite, say as little as possible. Sometimes it&#039;s better to insist on your rights (when you stand to lose by giving them up) other times they&#039;ll let you go. I don&#039;t like to let the cops search my car, because even if I&#039;m &#039;clean&#039;, it takes so damn long. So just tell them, politely, that you don&#039;t consent (they usually ask, or are supposed to) to a search and try to &#039;wind up&#039; the interview. They&#039;ll give you some bullshit like &#039;we saw a car that was involved in a burglury that is similar to your car&#039; but that&#039;s just to hold you while they ask a bunch of questions, try to get you to lie to them, and then try to figure out WHY you are lying. <br />Oh, and if you are arrested for a warrant, don&#039;t think that they won&#039;t search your car, including the truck.

				And of course it really helps to look clean, young, you&#039;ve got a job, you&#039;re not just &#039;cruising&#039; etc. If you&#039;re in a neighborhood to score, and you got somebody in your car (who will probably give you up the minute he is asked) better at least know his name, where you all are going etc. <br />It&#039;s really hard to prepare somebody for a significant &#039;encounter&#039; with the cops. Remember that you&#039;re breaking the law (with your friends, partying, it&#039;s easy to be confident you won&#039;t be stopped going to or from&nbsp; party/rave, etc) It&#039;s only after you&#039;ve spent some time in jail that you believe that things can OFTEN go wrong, and try to have &#039;redundant&#039; security. Like NOT drinking a beer while driving (or open container in car) NOT having the dope under the seat or in your pocket. There is UNLIMITED number of things that can go wrong, and only a few ways that things can turn out &#039;right&#039; if you get a cop on &#039;your tail&#039;. YOU CAN&#039;T FORGET you&#039;re breaking the law. The cops can make 5 mistakes and still go home at the end of his day, but if you make ONE mistake, you won&#039;t be going home that day. <br />And the shit that goes with a arrest-towing and storing your car, getting your car out of storage, police release of car, getting a lawyer (they&#039;ll ask for MINIMUM $5,000 right off the top, and still have you plead guilty) You&#039;ll have to drug test for fucking YEARS, you&#039;ll be on PROBATION for years (first two times I went to the pen was for &#039;violating probation&#039;)<br />You get to eat boloney &#039;sandwiches&#039; (mystery meat) and shit you wouldn&#039;t feed your dog,&nbsp; you&#039;ll have to associate with crude talking tattooed (usually shitty tattoo&#039;s too) people who have too many muscles to have a job, people who want to see what you&#039;re &#039;good&#039; for-money, to intimidate, etc. And you&#039;ll probably be locked up with minorities (if you are minority, everything I mentioned still applies) At least you&#039;ll be able to understand novels like &#039;Crime and Punishment&#039; that might have seemed exaggarated before, and maybe you&#039;ll come out with some minor artistic skills (especially Micky Mouse pictures seem popular) You&#039;ll watch your cell mate take 2-3 days writing a letter, with pictures and artwork to his girlfriend, and get to hear how bad he was on the outside. Seriously, it will change somebody from a happy go lucky person who likes to get high, doesn&#039;t want to hurt anybody into a bitter and quiet person, who no longer has much empathy for other people. A year in jail WILL change you, and not in a better way. <br />After a few weeks or months behind bars, you can start to look at public situations differently. You&#039;re usually ok in a house, even if the neighbors are complaining about noise, it&#039;s on the street that&#039;s dangerous.

				And with the SR, you can avoid ALL the scoring problems (which is where I always got popped) and stay off the street. The SR changes EVERYTHING.
