				I guess the point is:&nbsp; <br /><br />You can use Tor Mail or some other anonymous email.<br />You don&#039;t need to give them your real MtGox account name (since they email you a MtGox voucher code anyway, which can be used on any MtGox account).<br />You don&#039;t need to give them any phone number at all.&nbsp; The SMS thing is optional.&nbsp; Just use the email method.<br />He likely walked to the bank since he is in Manhattan.<br /><br />So the only identity anyone would get is your face on camera walking into a bank.<br /><br />But that&#039;s true no matter whether you go to a store to buy a MoneyPak, or an ATM to get cash.&nbsp; Cameras are everywhere.<br /><br />But there&#039;s nothing illegal about buying Bitcoin anyway.&nbsp; Plenty of people are buying Bitcoin as an investment.<br />

				True.&nbsp; So for buying only bitcoins, in amounts less than $1000 at a time, and with the funds sent to an anonymous MtGox account, I think there&#039;s an extremely low probability that anyone on Earth would care.&nbsp; Much less use bank surveillance cameras to track the buyer of $250 worth of bitcoins.&nbsp; Even then, the bank only knows you are paying &quot;TrustCash&quot;.&nbsp; TrustCash only knows you are paying BitInstant.&nbsp; BitInstant only knows you are putting US dollars into MtGox.&nbsp; You don&#039;t actually buy the bitcoins until you do that on MtGox itself.&nbsp; As I said, keep in mind that bitcoins are legal, and people use them for millions of things every day.&nbsp; It&#039;s just like cash.&nbsp; No one cares if you buy 250 US dollars from someone for 195 Euros.&nbsp; Dollars are legal, Euros are legal, and bitcoins are legal. <br />
