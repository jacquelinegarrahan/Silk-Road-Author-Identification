				Does anyone know of or think that an LEO on Craigslist would post an ad looking for &#039;420 friendly&#039; people to hang out, date, or whatever?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been thinking of looking for IRL customers by responding to ads like that with offers to sell but I&#039;m also wondering if I&#039;m likely to email an extremely bored cop looking for stoners to bust or recruit as CIs.

				In my formerly badge-carrying opinion, I think it&#039;s more likely you&#039;d become the victim of a robbery.&nbsp; But, as a way to meet new customers, I cannot think of a worse idea (except maybe FB or topix).&nbsp; Most undercover cops are actually basic law enforcement students who are hired by an agency, but whose face is not yet &quot;burned.&quot;&nbsp; Contrary to what you see in the movies, many undercover assignments don&#039;t last longer than it takes to buy a dime bag (well, an afternoon, anyway).&nbsp; The probability that you would run into one of these kids as a result of a CL is dangerously high.<br /><br />

				They assume if your worth busting you wouldn&#039;t be looking for customers on CL.&nbsp; No offense.&nbsp; It could work though imo to meet customers.&nbsp; I had a friend that put must be 420 friendly in ads when he rented rooms and it worked.&nbsp; I garnered customers through dating though I usually started that by asking if they could help me and then slowly brought it around to me helping them or their friends because you never knew who&#039;s been busted.&nbsp; The best way to do it is be organic.&nbsp; Go out with people you know and slowly meet people they know.&nbsp; That way you can get the skinny on everybody first, and don&#039;t mess with people who&#039;ve been busted.

				No, just no. Don&#039;t use CL to find customers. I don&#039;t think cops really waste their tjme on there, but a whole lot of scumbags and theifs do. Do yourself a favor and don&#039;t even consider CL. Find people IRL
