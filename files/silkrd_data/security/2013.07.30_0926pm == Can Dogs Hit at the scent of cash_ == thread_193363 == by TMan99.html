				If I recieve cash in the mail for cashing out, are dogs able to hit at the scent of the cash? I heard somewhere that dogs could hit at it. If this is true it seems risky to recieve thousands of dollars into a mailbox every month.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Dogs are trained to detect cash just as easy as they are trained to detect drugs, people carrying food across airports, it all pretty much comes down to what you train them for, they will do their best to find :) But how do they detect cash? Most currencies in the world are printed on certain and regulated paper, and also the ink they use to print on the paper is highly regulated and more then likely their uses/purchases are monitored very closely by the correct authorities, in US for example its the Secret Service, in UK the Royal Mint and so on. Cash lets off scent just like anything, have you ever smelt cash money? Yeah boy, I bet you can even smell it blindfolded and each time get it right!<br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				I&#039;ve seen numbers that about 70% of USD bills are tainted with heroin and over 90% of euro bills are tainted with coke. Seeing as there&#039;s just north of $24,000 per inch of stacked $100 USD bills the dogs can easily detect the money from the amount of drug residue on them. So you&#039;ll have to seal them like you would any drug to prevent the scent from getting out. Of course, that won&#039;t conceal the bills from the metal detectors&nbsp; ;)

				YES.<br /><br />Most drug dogs will hit on large sums of cash. They are specifically trained to detect stacks of bills regardless of any drug residue, although that certainly doesn&#039;t help either.

				All this begs the question why would a dog be in a position to sniff a package? There are literally tens of millions of packages going through the mails in he US alone every day; how can they possibly pick out a package to get a dog to smell it? I mean, it&#039;s all highly automated. Unless of course ther&#039;s something very suspicious about the package to begin with, then they&#039;d isolate it, study it, etc.<br /><br />But if not, why worry?<br /><br />goblin

				I have herd rumors that there are RFID tags in larger USD bills. This may or may not be true. Honestly, I haven&#039;t completed any serious research into the matter but it wouldn&#039;t surprise me at all.

				Make sure to keep any cash in the mail under $10,000, like $9,900. Just to make sure you&#039;re not breaking any reporting requirements. If a package of cash is seized, have a good story for why you&#039;re sending/receiving the cash, and get a lawyer to help you get it back and clear your name. The DHS seems to be very actively going after cash in the mail that seems suspicious.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Keeping the cash amount below the $10K reporting requirement won&#039;t work in America. You can still be charged with structuring, which is a serious felony. And the money will be seized regardless. No charge, no trial. You&#039;ll never get it back unless you can prove that it&#039;s yours, meaning that it was made legally. When money is concerned you&#039;re guilty until proven innocent. I&#039;ve said it a few times before.
