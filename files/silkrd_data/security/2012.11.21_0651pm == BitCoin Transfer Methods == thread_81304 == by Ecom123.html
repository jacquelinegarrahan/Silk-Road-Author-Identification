				Sup guys, i&#039;ve been trying to search the forums for a solid answer and cant really find one that I feel is concrete. <br /><br />When buying Bitcoins and sending directly to a btc address is it &quot;unwise&quot; to use your SR address as the destination?<br />Now one would think this isnt smart but ive read in a few places here that some users do this and claim that SR itself does a bit of a fog and tumble before it enters your account. Can anyone confirm this? And is it sufficient enough?<br /><br />Also if anyone can link me to a post where it describes new safety tips for buying BTC since all this new bs that is going on with bitinstant, last i knew i was able to just got to any bank as joe sherlock and there ya go.<br /><br />pe@ce

				This is not as easy to answer as you might think because everyone has different degrees of paranoia and the best way to deal with it.<br />First about SR - yes it does tumble your coins, you can (or could) read about it in the &quot;Buyers Guide&quot;., or may be it is now in the SR Wiki. But many people - myself included - think that to go from BitInstant(for example) direct to SR is stretching&nbsp; the plausible denialability to breaking point, i.e. it is too easy to follow the BTC transaction via the blockchain info and so make it easier for LE to make a case against you (or whatever), especially if the SR server itself got compromised.<br />So to break the chain of evidence most&nbsp; people like to use an online wallet or two(e.g. Instawallet, Blockchain.Info) or have their own wallet using a BTC client. Regarding Bitinstant you might find this thread helpful:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38633.0<br />Hope this helps :)

Worked just fine, and probably a very low risk of being prosecuted on purchasing .5g of molly or some shit like that.<br /><br />If I was regularly making purchases of several hundred dollars, I believe I would start taking more extreme measures to conceal any possible traces of identity/location, but I&#039;m not very paranoid given my current level of activity.<br /><br />To answer your question more on point, it does seem that SR does a good enough job, because I bet way more people than we&#039;d like to think send coins right in there.&nbsp; The more tumbling you put between the purchasing and delivery to SR, the less likely that you&#039;d be easily traced based on the bitcoin transaction.

				Like so much on here, there&#039;s no one good answer: I&#039;ve sent money straight to here, and never worried about it...when I&#039;m thinking clearly, I&#039;ll make sure btc get at least one bounce somewhere before arrival, but I tend to be a bit careless, doubt LE is hiding in closet if you know what I mean...but like so much in this area, you have to make your decisions on how careful *you* want to be.<br /><br />Like using Tails or just using Tor browser?&nbsp; Or going out on your home wifi, or wandering over to a coffee shop?&nbsp; Or using a virtual machine?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how others are, but I started out *real* careful, but as in all things human, I get kind of complacent as time goes by....for be, get an instawallet and make sure btc goes thru there, and then it&#039;s cool...

				Thanks for the help guys i appreciate it.<br /><br />Im probly just ganna stick to sending it right to my SR account. I am studing law in college and honestly myself i am only a user, though i do transfer money regularly onto my account, i highly doubt*based on my knowledge) me a non-violent user will ever be initially targeted by LE for fueling my own desires even if i was discovered as doing so, the resources the go into investigations are mind blowing to the point of almost being irrational. Even myself, today if i was to present a case to my class based on what im doing, i would be the laughing stock of the class. <br /><br />Furthermore, I may not be correctly up to speed on this whole TOR legality but even xfering BTCs to a SR wallet i don;t initially see anything illegal being done. Sure most of SR&#039;s listings are illegal. while some aren&#039;t. Whose to say your aren&#039;t purchasing legal goods?(I could be wrong on certain stipulations with SR here but i will research this further)

				I like this. Last line of defence: &quot;Officer, I have a HORRIBLE internet porn addiction and I can&#039;t let my wife find out about it. That&#039;s why I buy it anonymously via the internet. Yes, $5750 worth of internet porn. I swear.&quot;
