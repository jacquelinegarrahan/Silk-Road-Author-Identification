				Bitcoin technical analysis blogger Sergio Lerner has uncovered a million btc hoard from block chain 1 that has never been sold; an estimated $150 million fortune. <br /><br />His detailed analysis concludes this one-million block of bitcoins belongs to founder Satoshi Nakamoto.<br /><br />His evidence is detailed and he has several follow-up posts that go into even further detail.<br /><br />(clearnet link)<br /><br />https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/#comment-811<br /><br />

				Old news.&nbsp; It&#039;s been posted here a few times.&nbsp; Once by me.&nbsp; By the way, it&#039;s strong speculation.&nbsp; Whoever it is has been mining since the beginning yes, and hasn&#039;t moved any coins.&nbsp; Old news regardless.

				Jesus, that article was written like two days ago. Bunch of ninjas in here I guess.<br /><br />The press made such a big deal about that $11 million btc fortune from the Winkelvoss twins and someone is sitting on a fortune ten times that.<br /><br />Either way it&#039;s not a good sign. Stocks that contain a heavy short interest are considered bullish because they have to cover at some point. Someone sitting on 10% of the entire bitcoin float means that at some point selling pressure could tamper any long-term rise in btc.

				Would governments try to lock him up or assassinate him for creating bitcoin? I&#039;m shore the bankers would have a crack at him. maybe being anonymous is the only way to survive. Bitcoin is still a baby and he knows this, this can be seen in the structure of bitcoin. Why would he sell his coins when he values them so much more than the market value. <br />Satoshi Nakamoto had a vision to change the world, $150million will not go far if you are trying to change the world. Imagine the entire world is using bitcoins day to day, now imagine the creator of this monetary freedom had 5% of the entire bitcoin economy. This person/group would be in a position to change the world.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				this was a great thread to read. learned some interesting stuff.<br /><br />think the 150million could have just been a testing machine to mine and then was discarded with no thought of the wallet :/ thats what im kind of leaning towards

Insignificant, yes. Carnegie Mellon researchers did a comprehensive analysis of Silk Road over 8 months in late 2011-2012, and estimated Silk Road sales to comprise roughly 5% of bitcoin trading. This was back when bitcoins were ~$15. Silk Road has grown immensely since then, but bitcoin has grown explosively. My guess is that Silk Road sales now account for less than 1% of bitcoin transactions.<br /><br />Here is the Carnegie Mellon analysis, btw. <br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING<br />http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/techreports/2012/tr_cylab12018.html

It has been the only underground market never to cause a stink like Italian, Irish, French, African (American), Asian criminal organizations. It seems to be the only pure marketplace left, even amidst CEO and banking conspiracies. Japan already went through their Housing Crisis in the 80s/90s. They are 30 years ahead of Americans and eons beyond Europe. Satoshi has enough economic influence over BTC to control the narcotic economy.<br /><br />Predictions:<br /><br />Mt. Gox will survive for more than century.<br /><br />BTC will never fall behind the production costs (which have been immaculately designed), and can only increase beyond mining costs.... which is over $60 already. This is like African ivory: the less of a resource, the more precious it becomes. Malthus was half right: as a commodity disappears, it increases in market price. What else needs to be considered is that the more hostility and repression BTC faces, the more precious it becomes. Miners hold the key to its value... which simultaneously depends on technological advancements--Moore&#039;s Law.<br /><br />Get the fuck with the program. Buy BTC. Hold it. And pay your respects to the most modest society on the planet.<br /><br />Peace, love, and Thank Nippon.

Furthermore, even if 90% of the global markets relied on BTC, all that means is that banks will begin offering services for BTC, which essentially removes any cryptocurrency protection BTC truly offers.<br /><br />People will ALWAYS get scammed, identity stolen, bank accounts stolen, etc., etc. Just because there is a currency that performs with more integrity and reliability than any bank will ever offer does not mean that banks will be threatened. Even people who use BTC have been scammed, so when there is a human element, there is a security flaw....<br /><br />Banks, corporations, and governments have to deal with the existence of BTC, but that in no way implies that this trinity of human corruption will ever be separated from controlling and managing the resources of the masses. <br /><br />In other words, BTC is best suited for intelligent, tech savvy individuals who are able to learn and adapt to the dynamic landscape of financial turmoil.
