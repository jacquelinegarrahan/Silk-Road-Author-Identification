				This is a question that I think only those veteran bitcoiners out there would be able to answer. Is it possible for someone who is monitoring the blockchain, to find out if a certain address is generated by a certain website or bitcoin service? Is there something in the string of characters which compose the BTC address which gives away its origin?<br /><br />Suppose I have a registered bitcoin fog url; it comes with a BTC address automatically of course. Suppose I use it to send BTC to another address. Can a monitor know that the originatiing address is from bitcoin fog? Ditto if I generate a new bitcoin fog address: will they know where it&#039;s from? <br /><br />Same for ANY BTC address. Can someone find its origins, whether instawallet, or mt. gox, or whatever? I always wonder about this.<br /><br />Thanks all!<br /><br />More to the point, can this compromise my anonymity in any way?

				I have just been reminded that SR vendors do have a mixer built into their accounts to stop their withdrawals being traced through block chain analysis. If I were in their place I would use Bitcoinfog too to be on the safe side but I&#039;ll leave it to our resident drug dealers to speak for themselves! :-D<br /><br />V.

You and other users walk up to him with your box of coins and he then hands each you a token with the right number of coins written on it. He then takes your box and flings your coins into the vault onto the large pile of coins already in there.<br /><br />The big pile of coins is then churned around a number of times (maybe using a large stick, I don&#039;t have much imagination!)<br /><br />The big man then inspects your token and randomly takes that number of coins from the big pile. These could belong to anyone of course and will almost certainly not belong to the same person. He then places them in a new box which you can then collect anonymously.<br /><br />The new box i.e the new Bitcoin address to which your coins are sent is crucial in that it breaks the easy to follow chain of transactions between your previous Bitcoin address and this one. As I mentioned before, Bitcoins must be sent from the same address at which they&#039;re received.

It&#039;s by no means perfect as it may still be possible to trace the transaction through examining Bitcoin transfers for similar amounts around the same time but if you have no choice but to obtain your Bitcoins in a traceable way e.g through bank transfer then I would say using a mixing service is essential.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Wonderful to have someone like you around.<br /><br />But do yo have an explanation that is more computerese (without going overboard as I am not a real techie)? It just seems that you have explained it in terms if a metaphor, rather than the nuts and bolts of how it actually works. Also, how exactly do we know that such a mixer is really there, without fallling into the trap of &quot;trusting&quot; DPR? After all, anyone can say anythihg they want about their service, but without verifying it, how do we really know? I hated Reagan, but his &quot;trust but verify&quot; routine is right on the mark.
