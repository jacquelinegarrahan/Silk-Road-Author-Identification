				Apparently Australian customs workers have been turning a blind eye to .....something/anything coming through our airports.(Except for those Idiots and actors you see on &#039;Customs&#039;). Entire shifts at a time, they say(the media&nbsp; only, at this stage) have been taking kickbacks to ..um..not see that pallet of tiles from Mexico City, or forget to let the dogs out on the Netherlands shipment.<br />&nbsp;Maybe if they were paid more, like they asked for ages, they wouldn&#039;t be striking now. That&#039;s right , open day at Aussie airports, with them striking over Xmas, hurry up guys, its almost open slather. Wish I was somewhere else right now, and coming home thru xmas.. :P<br /><br />***THIS POST DOES NOT SUGGEST ANYTHING, i hope. ::)***

				My steroid hookup always claimed he had a contact at Sydney airport who would make sure his packages got through, but I always assumed he was talking shit like 95% of people in the drugs game.<br /><br />I guess he could have been telling the truth.

				I feel like now would be a pretty bad time for this actually, there&#039;s going to be some bigtime crackdowns and firings all throughout and they&#039;re going to try to get as many busts as they can to try and show they have control of it. Idk that&#039;s my .02 at least.

				So ultimately, this will be bad in the sense that all new customs officials will be drafted and actually start checking packages thoroughly.<br /><br />That&#039;s worse possible outcome...

				There will always be a few dirty customs officials &amp; I don&#039;t see how they could possibly do a crackdown while their funding &amp; staffing has been massively cut already &amp; there is no way that even the pay rises they ask for will stop officials accepting cutbacks.

				anyone read/heard/know how long the strike could last for? with the weekend plus christmas and public holidays coming up it would be harder to check more parcels/crackdown cause of the volume coming in plus striking staff and staff that have been fired and charged. so in saying all this wouldnt it be better to buy now?
