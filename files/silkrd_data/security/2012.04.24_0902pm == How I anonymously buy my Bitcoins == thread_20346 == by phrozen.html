				I thought I&#039;d take a minute to write down how I now buy Bitcoins after Dwolla became unreliable. I think this is a pretty safe way since it never ties my own identity to any given step, including the payment process.<br /><br />1. Go to BitInstant and place an order for $100 (or however much) to do a cash deposit<br />2. Walk into a bank, hand the teller the cash and the account number<br />3. Receive a confirmation within the hour from BitInstant<br />4. Move all the bitcoins through BitCoin247 temporarily (I can use Tor to login to this site, unlike Mt Gox, but it&#039;s picky about your location so you may need to choose a new identity until the login works). Also, I use a fake gmail account when signing up with any service, and I only login to that from Tor.<br />5. Move the money from Bitcoin247 to Silk Road<br /><br />I believe this is fairly secure, as my identity is not linked at any point. Feel free to comment if you have your own methods you use that make it easy and secure to do the payment process.

				I like your method, it sounds more secure since technically I could be traced back to the bank surveillance, and the tumbling is missing from my method. Thanks for posting your response.

				Is SR&#039;s automatic tumbler not good enough?

				I have found that its very difficult to obtain BTC &quot;anonymously&quot; at the front end. I&#039;d rather get the coins into my wallet whichever way is the fastest/cheapest/most convenient and then tumble and move the coins before getting them to SR. I have less faith in the anonymity of the acquisition anyway.<br /><br />So far what I&#039;ve done to get the coins:<br />1. Cash deposit to Get-Bitcoin<br />2. Cash deposit to MtGox<br />3. Cash deposit to Liberty Reserve, then OTC.<br />3. OTC - Moneypack<br />4. Paypal, otc<br /><br />In each case the initial transfer was to an Instawallet, then moved in installments to other wallets, then to my personal wallet for &quot;storage.&quot;<br /><br />From there I move into Bitcoin Fog, and pay out into more one time use wallets, then into SR.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a cloudy enough chain, especially with Bitcoin Fog, to avoid detection.<br /><br />What&#039;s the URL for Bitcoin247? Bitcoin247.com just says &quot;under construction.&quot;

				Sup guys it&#039;s my first post. I am just now learning the bitcoin process. I was wondering though, when you go to buy them could you use a Walmart prepaid visa the temporary card loaded with $100 and take that to the bank? <br /><br />

				If you move your coins through a few one time use wallets, even if the trail could be followed, how could it be proven that you were in control of all of those wallets beyond the first one? Just a thought.
