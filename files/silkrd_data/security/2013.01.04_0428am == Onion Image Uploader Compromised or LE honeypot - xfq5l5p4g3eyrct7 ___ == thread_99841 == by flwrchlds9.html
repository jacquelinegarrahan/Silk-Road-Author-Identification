				Others should know by now, but did not see forum topic on it.<br /><br />Either OnionImageUploader was always run by Dutch police, or it was captured/compromised by Dutch police.<br /><br />All old images are now in possession of Dutch police.&nbsp; <br /><br />xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion<br /><br />Any other have more info on this?

				They didn&#039;t capture it. Onion Image Uploader is hosted on Freedom Hosting and all the other sites are fine. FH is still up and hasn&#039;t been seized or compromised. Either Dutch LE hacked OIU or a random hacker did and uploaded those pics for the lulz.<br /><br />By the way, this is like last year&#039;s news.

				Hey astor, I saw your link that you posted in the other thread in the off topic section.&nbsp; Wondering which image hosting site you recommend from that list?

				If the police hack a site where people are doing illegal things - they do not tell you.<br /><br />Why the fuck would they let you know? To give you time to burn your laptop, so that they can&#039;t charge you with jack shit.<br /><br />It is silly to think it was LE, and if it was LE they have fucking gone full retard here.<br /><br />It was probably just some hacker who wanted some lulz.

				Once a hidden service is hacked the private key for the hidden service can be captured.<br /><br />Once you have this private key you can essentially steal the domain and point it to any server.<br /><br />It is possible that the site was compromised by another channel and then the private key was taken and used to serve different images.

It depends on the type of hack. It&#039;s possible to hack a web server through a PHP exploit (which is what the OIU hack appears to be) without rooting the box. The attacker would never have privileges beyond that of the web server and could not read directories that are inaccessible to the web server.<br /><br />Hidden service private keys are kept in /var/lib/tor, which is read protected and thus limited to root and the tor user (debian-tor on Debian and Ubuntu). The web server user (usually www-data) can&#039;t read that folder.
