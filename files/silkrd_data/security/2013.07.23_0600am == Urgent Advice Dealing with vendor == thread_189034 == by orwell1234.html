				Hi all! I&#039;m curious for the forum&#039;s opinion on my predicament. I have a order processing with a vendor who has been on the road for 5 months with 300+ transactions with 100% feedback..I placed my order like usual with pgp and what not. The vendor then sends a message asking that I resend my address in privenote because they have misplaced their usb for their pgp key? I really am bothered by this in the forum its stated that privnote is incredibly insecure for sensitive information. A small side issue as well. I may have not seen but I vetted this vendor pretty well before placing the order. He has an UPDATE on his page that FE is required I didn&#039;t see this when I placed the order I FE for no one just samples when under 20$. I sent a polite message to the vendor explaining my issues with using privenote and the FE thing. I&#039;ve yet to hear a response and my order is still in processing. I&#039;ve come to the forum in hopes someone has had a similar experience or is knowledgeable in resolving this thanks again SR!

				Considering the facts contained within your post, such as the fake that the vendor says they misplaced their pgp key and they now require FE, I would hold off before even placing an order. Those to things combine may indicate that the original owner of the account has lost control.

				It was a little suspicious, vendor could always change his pgp if he lost his key? I&#039;ve done it with mine? How do I get him/her to release my funds back to me? What makes it even more bizzare is the vendor&#039;s page specifically says PGP is for people who are safe and that he doesn&#039;t use privenote. How the hell aside from the cops could someone else get control of a vendor account?

Choose another vendor. A 300+ vendor &quot;loosing his PGP Key&quot; is most likely bullshit, then add the new FE policy. Go the other way and don&#039;t look back. Safety is number one.<br /><br />Care to share the vendor so it can be looked into?

				yep the original vendor has lost control of the acct. if you&nbsp; disagree, id just wait a few a days and see if he finds his pgp, and just refuse to FE ...always
