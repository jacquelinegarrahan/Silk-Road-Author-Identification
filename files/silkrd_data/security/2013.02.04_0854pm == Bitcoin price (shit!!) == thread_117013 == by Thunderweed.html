				The majority of listings on SilkRoad are pegged to the US dollar which means at this moment in time each Bitcoin is worth $22.92 weighted average (clearwebalert) https://mtgox.com/ when the price of Bitcoin rises the price of the listing falls meaning your still receiving&nbsp; the same value for your Bitcoin. The reason why Bitcoin has increased so rapidly over the past month is because the mined blocks have halved from 50 to 25, which is making the miners work twice as hard for the same amount of coin plus the rise in electricity costs to generate the coin, with the added increase in supply and demand. What&#039;s the most important thing to remember here is not the value of the coin but is your listing pegged to the US dollar meaning you&#039;ll receive the right value for your Bitcoin. Bitcoin has risen approx $2.22 in the past week, whether or not this trend will continue time will tell.

				I tend to agree, SS.&nbsp; While there have been a number of alternative currencies to crop up over the years, none seem to have been as successful as the BTC, and the contenders are few and far between.&nbsp; The LTC is still around, and is popular I think mainly because it isn&#039;t as difficult to solve as BTC; it is therefore easier to mine.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that means the LTC will replace the BTC, though; everyone I know who mines or trades in LTC does so as a shortcut to BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />I won&#039;t take that wager.&nbsp; In fact, I think that we&#039;ll see the day when we won&#039;t be measuring the prices of things in whole BTCs, but in parts, because the value of a single bitcoin will be so great.&nbsp;

				Part of this goes to your overall financial picture.&nbsp; If you have a little money you can invest, then just think of it that way - as an investment.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m kind of thinking that most people are just buying BTCs according to need.&nbsp; The pills you want are 4 BTCs, so you do a Bitinstant transfer for $120, etc... I think the people with hundreds in the BTC &quot;bank&quot; are probably the minority.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just gotten to the point where I&#039;m keeping USD in an exchange service (bitfloor), and buying BTC when I need it.&nbsp; The more the BTC climbs, though, the more dumb that strategy feels to me.
