				I have moved btcs to a address x amount of times&nbsp; but recently I have tried to withdraw btcs from&nbsp; my mt gox account to another address and get this message. &quot;Your account is currently pending review, please visit https://mtgox.com/forms/verification&quot; They are asking for my gov issued id to verify my identity.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions? <br />

				I am in the IT field so I&#039;m tech savy but I know one thing, mt gox is by far confusing as hell for myself. They just got too many rules, like when you send money the name you send with needs to be same as mt gox, just too many rules to even wanna follow em all. I sure someone will think that the rules /terms of service are simple, but seriously why is that an immiscible arguement, we&#039;re all disobeying rules on here

				Sorry bro, I stopped using them months ago. Ever since they started that AML bull shit I bailed. I still have a small amount of BTC tied up there with the same problem you have.&nbsp; They&#039;re&nbsp; trying to lock down BTC and reduce the anonymity that it made it what it is. If anyone knows another way with Mt. Gox I&#039;d love to hear it also.

				I&#039;m showing my noobies here, but a month ago, when I knew LESS than the nothing I know now, Mt. Gox was one of the first places I went to try to get BTCs.&nbsp; They wanted a scan of a govt. ID from the get-go.&nbsp; And, like a fool, I complied with the Borg&#039;s request.&nbsp; Of course, it took almost two weeks to verify me, and in that time I figured out how to browse anonymously, and how better to get BTCs, so now my Mt. Gox account is collecting dust.&nbsp; But, before you know it, the only thing standing between you and your BTC privacy will be your wits and the SR randomizer.

				would you mind sharing some knowledge Sleepyeyes ?<br />i could be wrong but its my current understanding to try and stay away from mt.gox<br /><br />just figured out i should use a bitcoin client ,new BTC address every transaction for security ,<br />how ever i still dont know where to purchase bitcoins,(as in what exchange is best,secure and anonymous)<br />i was told bit-instant is good (better than mt.gox) <br />but after doing some research on them ,i see some people are having issues issues with their services <br />as of the recent couple of weeks,<br /><br />If you ,or anyone else ,could recommend us a bitcoin exchange with numerous forms of payment<br />&amp; a client it would be very cool and im sure alot of us could benefit from it <br /><br />i wonder what forms of payment are most secure/anonymous<br />ive heard some people prefer to make bank deposits that dont require any ID <br />

				I still like bitinstant. You stay anonymous, the Exchange rate is reasonable, it is fast. I know that their service was down and some people were delayed in getting coins. As far as I know nobody lost coins. <br /><br />Mtgox wants way too much personal info for my taste. Not worried about LE since bitcoins are legal to own. But I am concerned about identity theft and giving personal info. Plus it takes 5 or 6 days to get your coins. <br /><br />There are private vendors who will sell you coins at a high price. U either send them money through western union or money packs then ( fingers and toes crossed ) hope you didn&#039;t just get scammed. With luck, maybe your coins will end up in your wallet.<br /><br />I think ill stick with bitinstant. Hasn&#039;t let me down yet. The longest I had to wait was 21/2 hours ( once ) for coins. Most went into my wallet before I got home. <br />

It took a business day, but all you need to get an account is an email addy, and you can make cash deposits at any Bank of America (you don&#039;t need a bank account).&nbsp; I&#039;m kind of excited about cryptocurrent.com.&nbsp; A lot of SR users have dealt with its founder and had really positive transactions.&nbsp; On the website, you can plug in your email to get notified when they&#039;re up and running.&nbsp; Oh, one other thing about bitinstant.&nbsp; They run a customer support thread on bitcointalk.org, which is kind of cool because their CEO actively posts there, and you can get issues solved if they occur.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had about 6 flawless transactions with them, and just 1 that had to wait 2 days.<br /><br />If you need a clean BTC address in a quick fast hurry, there&#039;s instawallet.&nbsp; Don&#039;t lose the URL it gives you, though, because you&#039;ll never get it back.&nbsp; And, I guess you know that you can go to blockchain.info for some things.&nbsp; It&#039;s mostly just great for seeing whether your transactions posted to your BTC addresses, but you can also get a wallet there, too.<br /><br />Basically, stay away from Dwolla, Mt. Gox, any service that demands photo ID or proof of residence.&nbsp; I&#039;d stay away from the private vendors who deal through western union, too, unless you actually develop a relationship with a vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Those are just a few things I learned by just feeling my way around, traveling the Road, and listening in on the Forum.&nbsp; But, I&#039;m nobody, dude.&nbsp; So, if anyone has anything to add, please feel free.

				Verification is supposed to take up to 7 business days.&nbsp; Mine took 2 weeks.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m lately the new walking advertisement for bitfloor.&nbsp; Within the space of two hours I deposited my cash and Bank of America (for a $1.84 fee), purchased BTCs on the bitfloor exchange (at the market rate for a $0.13 fee), and my BTCs appeared in my SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was dealing with small amounts, so the fees would be larger for larger amounts, but still way more reasonable than any other service I&#039;ve used.&nbsp; And, all you need to use bitfloor is an email address.

				Awesome! Thanks for the heads up on bitfloor. I had been away for a few months and went to do my usual bitinstant deposit and was unpleasantly surprised with all the new Moneygram Zip Zap crapola. I did it because I had no other choice but I did not like it and I promised myself I would find another way. Looks like I just did. I created my acct and have my first bitfloor deposit going in BoA tomorrow. Thanks a bunch!!! SR is back for me in a big way.

				Damn that sucks. I thought freakin bank of America was ubiquitous.&nbsp; Maybe you could snail mail the scratch and bitfloor deposit ticket to a trusted friend near the bank? It would prob only take one day if the BOA is within 2 hours distance. They don&#039;t ask for ID and the USD just shows up in your bitfloor acct without even having to call them and verify the deposit like with the old bitinstant. I just made my first deposit with bitfloor today. Thank God I&#039;m back to old anonymous bank deposit. I feel so much better!

				@Omnadren I just read elsewhere on the forum that you can send cash in the mail to cryptocurrent. They charge 5% tho, and they&#039;ll send you a Fedex label to use for your shit overnight. It&#039;s not ideal, but hey, it&#039;s better than no coins at all.

				@omnadren- you can also use ziggap.com to do a cash deposit at chase banks if that helps. The lame part is that this feature is temporarily suspended according to their website. Keep trying back. You can also fund with them using MG and WU, but that sucks in a lot of ways.

				Medicine has a good idea there. I just ordered a fake from Havemeier and it&#039;s bad ASS. He&#039;s also the cheapest one going- just over a C note. Just over a week from order till it was in hand. He&#039;s definitely worth it if that helps the sitch get resolved. Depending on how many coins you have, I guess. But a good fake ID is a good thing to have, in the event of an emergency.

I&#039;ve used mtgox a few times without any problems. I guess they are changing how they operate now.

				I&#039;m not really reading this thread.<br />Im just stopping by to say<br />WHO CARES ABOUT AN ID?<br /><br />You can simply wash your coins by Depositing them into a Blockchain wallet then withdrawing them<br />Do that a couple times and your Coins just became mixed with 10000 other people&#039;s coins.<br /><br />Using fake IDs or trying to hide your Identity for Purchasing bitcoin is RETARDED!<br />The only thing you&#039;re doing is Increasing the risk of losing it.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not illegal to buy.<br />Put 1 penny into a jar of 10000 pennies.... shake and now try to remove that same penny..... have fun finding it<br />Now go do this with your bitcoin and a BlockChain wallet or two.

				MtGox has had a long and open relationship with the DEA and other policing agencies.&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably have to give your real ID to MtGox if you do business with them..&nbsp; It&#039;s happened to so many people there was, and may still be, a thread on their website from customers angered to find out that as soon as they tried to withdraw the Bitcoins they&#039;d bought, they had to wait for &quot;verification.&quot; <br />As Hash has mentioned, you can &quot;wash&quot; your coins after MtGox decides you can withdraw them. I think the people at MtGox are scam artists, but once they have your cash, what are you going to do? <br />Avoid dealing with MtGox if you can. <br />

				I finally got my coins out of Mtgox. I had to use my real ID. I don&#039;t have a fake ID. But i moved them to my wallet. Then up to SR. I think in the future, I&#039;ll put them in my wallet, and then wash them with some other service. I don&#039;t know how which one yet. I&#039;ll have to look around. Can anyone suggest something? PM if it&#039;s more secure.

				Does anyone know if mt gox is requiring the verification with ALL users or just people who have logged on to their account over TOR or something? Because if they are doing that with everyone I&#039;m about to open up a BitFloor account.

				I used Mt.Gox when I first started with Bitcoin close to two years ago. I haven&#039;t used the account in almost as long but took part in a promotion where BTC was deposited into my account there. When I went and logged back in to move the coin it said I had to complete the AML forms and be verified first.&nbsp; I have never logged in through TOR and sure as hell didn&#039;t ask to be verified so I would have to think it&#039;s for anyone who wants to deal there.&nbsp; I could be wrong though, but that&#039;s what happened to me. Either way FUCK MT.GOX. There are better options for you.

				FUUUUUUUCKKKK!!!! i wish i saw this post before i made a second account, just got burned with the verification process.<br /><br />This cries out to me as a TERRIBLE idea...i mean isn&#039;t the point of BTC&#039;s to be anonymous?<br /><br />I wont give them the satisfaction of stealing my money, so I&#039;m gonna get verified and use the BTC to buy legit things else where....<br /><br />I guess my question here is, how can i get anonymous BTC&#039;s now?&nbsp; I wanted to use BitFloor but they folded right?<br /><br />Also...if i give MTfuckHeads my info, is there ANY way they can back track my past orders and see where my BTC&#039;s went?<br /><br />I&#039;m not a huge buyer, but i&#039;ve been around for a while and it&#039;s kinda all started to add up lol....<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br /><br />IMO Fuck MT Gox.... they are fucking con artists.... i mean what kind of business lets you purchase their merchandise, then tells you you can&#039;t use it until you give them my ID<br /><br />It even says in their own clauses that a level 0 user doesn&#039;t need to be verified, but alass... the small print says they can make u verify at anytime....still buck shit letting you buy first then ask for id after while holding your BTC&#039;s hostage!!!<br /><br /><br />FUUUUUCK MTGOX!!!!!!!!!!!

				The point is just making sure you don&#039;t make a link with MTGox and SR of ANY kind. So get a virtual/software wallet. then use one of those bitcoin washing services. I&#039;m sure many people who have sent them their info, will continue using MtGox. If you send from MtGox straight into SR, You&#039;re just asking for trouble.

				I may be a new forum member, but I&#039;ve been on SR for over a year now. - One of my earliest lessons was Mt Gox is completely unnecessary.&nbsp; Wasted two months dealing with them. - BitInstant was just coming on the scene, and to this day I still use them. They&#039;ve had they&#039;re own ups and downs just like SR and the attacks, not to mention US Gov&#039;t agencies breathing down their necks to &quot;make sure no laundering is going on&quot;. More Gov&#039;t waste. They should be checking the House, Senate, and White House, for the real money laundering. <br /><br />I stand by BitInstant (US only ATM). I&#039;ve only had a problem once, and it was due to my own error, yet they were able to solve it for me. <br /><br />Also BlueSkyTraders<br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />Hope this helps!
