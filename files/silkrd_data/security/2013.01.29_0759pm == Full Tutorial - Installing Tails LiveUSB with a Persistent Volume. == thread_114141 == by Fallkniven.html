				READ ME!!! I&#039;M IMPORTANT!!! ***&gt;&gt;&gt; Pendrivelinux Universal USB Installer has a new &quot;persistence&quot; feature in the latest version (1.9.3.6). I have not tried this with Tails yet, as such I will not entertain any questions on how to go about using it until I am satisfied my own knowledge of it is sound. Thanks for your patience and understanding, also, If you have successfully used this &quot;persistence&quot; feature in UUI while installing Tails, let us know what happened. &lt;&lt;&lt;***<br /><br /><br /><br />Tutorial Part 1 - How to install Tails onto a USB drive.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />Tails stands for &quot;The Amnesiac Incognito Live System&quot;. Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer&#039;s original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux. <br /><br />Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked. <br /><br />Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - &quot;It&#039;s very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis.&quot; <br /><br />You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere. <br /><br /><br />*** Update: Meatgrinder has posted steps on how to install Tails to a DVD first, then onto a USB from there. Thanks! ***<br />*** Update #2: Vegeta has offered a way to install Tails to USB with the use of a virtual machine. Thanks! *** <br />*** If any of the links do not work, please PM me and I will update them for you! *** <br />*** All of the following links can and should be downloaded through the Tor network! *** <br /><br />1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -<br />https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html <br /><br />1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -<br />https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key <br /><br />2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -<br />http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ <br /><br />3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3a - Read and &#039;agree to&#039; the disclaimer <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3b - Select &quot;Tails&quot; from the first drop-down list, it&#039;s towards the end of the list (step 1) <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2) <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3) <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3e - Click &#039;Create&#039; button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least. <br /><br />4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)<br /><br />**** (Steps continue in the next post!) ****<br /><br /><br />Booting from a USB drive: <br />-------------------------------------<br />If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.&nbsp; You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for &#039;removable drive&#039; or &#039;USB media&#039;. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue. <br /><br />Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar). <br />(Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version) http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/ <br /><br />For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read<br />http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm<br /><br />If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read this<br />http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/ <br /><br />Any other questions, ask away. or PM.&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails...<br />https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en<br />https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin<br /><br />Next up: Installing a Persistent Volume alongside a LiveUSB copy of Tails (this is why you need TWO USB drives)

				Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />You may want to print this text out on paper for easier reference. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />*** (Continued from first post!) ***<br />&nbsp;<br />5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo &#039;skin&#039; to make Tails look more like XP if you&#039;re in a public place for example, this is also optional.<br />&nbsp;<br />7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the &#039;Applications/Accessories&#039; menu, then highlight &#039;Tails&#039;, then click &#039;Tails USB Installer&#039;. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 7a - Click the 1st option &quot;Clone &amp; Install&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 7c - Click &#039;Next&#039;, then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don&#039;t forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required. <br />&nbsp;<br />9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the &#039;Applications&#039; menu, then highlight the &#039;System Tools&#039; sub-menu, then click on &quot;Configure Persistent Volume&quot;. (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 &amp; &quot;$p3c|4!&quot; characters&nbsp; ;) )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 9b - Click &quot;Create&quot; and wait for it to finish.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the &#039;System&#039; menu, then highlight the &#039;Preferences&#039; submenu, then click on &#039;Network Connections&#039;. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called &#039;IceWeasel&#039;. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the &#039;IceWeasel&#039; browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)<br />&nbsp;<br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion - remember it! <br />&nbsp;<br />You are now finished! Feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications, log into the SR forum and let us know you&#039;re using Tails.<br /><br />You can also head over to this excellent thread by Just Chipper - &quot;HOWTO: Install Electrum Bitcoin Wallet on Tails LiveUSB&quot;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94939.0<br /><br /><br />Any comments, questions or criticisms are welcome&nbsp; ;) 8) <br />

				Hi Fallkniven,<br /><br />I did not need 2 USB sticks to make a persistent tails, only 1.<br /><br />I downloaded the tails ISO, burned it to a blank DVD, left it in the DVD tray and rebooted.<br /><br />Booted into tails, hit Applications&#039; menu, then highlight &#039;Tails&#039;, then click &#039;Tails USB Installer&#039; then clone and install (as directed above)<br /><br />It made the USB stick into a tails bootloader.<br /><br />Once finished, I plugged the USB into my laptop (the above was done on my gaming/media computer) once booted into tails on my laptop, I went back to &quot;Applications -&gt; Tails -&gt; Configure persistent volume, chose what I wanted, rebooted and it was done (encryption keys, password hashes etc all saved) tried it on my 3 laptops and my brothers too, all working fine with my tails USB as a persistent volume with files I made as a test. Must have done 30 or so reboots to test it :)<br /><br />

Thanks for also mentioning the DVD/USB method of installing Tails - a valid option for many people.<br /><br />Remember to check the tails website regularly for updates and security fixes. This OS is still very young, bugs and backdoors are bound to be found out eventually and need patching. Kinda like Windows, it&#039;s always being picked apart by hackers looking for another way in, so microshit are constantly releasing updates to patch the holes.

				Thanks for posting this Fallkniven.<br />I have managed to get tails set up on a usb stick, but without the persistent volume.<br /><br />Once I get my hands on another usb stick (or a dvd that works with my burner)I will go through it all again and set one up with persistent volume.<br />Can&#039;t hurt to practice since I will be forced to redo it every time an update comes out anyway.<br /><br />So, once you have persistent volume you can just copy pgp keys etc onto the usb stick?<br />Am I correctly assuming, that I need to re-copy the keys everytime I update because all data on the stick is lost every time one makes an update?<br /><br />I was hoping to leave no trace of tor or encryption on my computer once I have tails all figured out.<br />Where do you keep your keys?<br /><br />Thanks so much for your help.

				yes, the persistent volume is like a normal folder, you can copy anything you want inside it, create other folders, even install programs inside this persistent folder. <br /><br />And i think the persistent folder will remain even after an update (although a back up would not be a bad idea), but i am not 100% sure about this as there was no update yet since i installed my tails on an usb stick

				Fallkniven, Mezzomixtor,<br />thanks for the info. I&#039;m not the most technologically adept, so a lot of this shit goes right over my head.<br />I&#039;ve made it this far not really by understanding but by trial and error, which has then resulted in understanding (sometimes).<br />Your replies have filled quite a few gaps in my knowledge and understanding of how to work with tails.<br />People like you play no small part in keeping me safe on the road and it is much appreciated.

				If you don&#039;t have a DVD drive or burner or DVD&#039;s to burn, but have access to a virtual machine, you could also install tails to USB using the virtual machine.<br />It would go something like this:<br />1) Download latest tails iso from: https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html <br />2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file<br />3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso<br />4) Insert a USB flash drive<br />5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead<br />6) Go to Applications -&gt; Tails -&gt; Tails USB Installer<br />7) Click &quot;Clone &amp; Install&quot;<br />8) Verify that the correct &quot;Target Device&quot; is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written<br />9) Click &quot;Create Live USB&quot;<br />10) Click &quot;Next&quot;<br />11) Once installation is completed, click &quot;OK&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s it! Now you can shut off the virtual machine, and your USB flash drive can boot tails on any computer capable of booting from USB<br />If you want to configure a persistent volume on a virtual machine, that&#039;s also possible! Though I doubt anyone wants to do it once they have the bootable USB with tails on it. If there&#039;s any interest, I can post how to do that as well. It&#039;s a bit more involved<br />

				Up until yesterday I scorned this thread, but now I have been forced to com crawling back! The ignominy!<br /><br />I am looking to set up tails with a persistent volume BUT (and this is the tricky bit) I want to run a VM within tails (specifically whonix). I have been browsing both the tails and whonix documentation and this is my question: If I run whonix on a VM on a tails live USB will it leave a trace? The whonix documentation says that whonix shares swap space with the host OS, which in this case would be a USB = wear leveling issues.<br /><br />Does tails even have swap space in the traditional sense? I&#039;m hoping this is a non-issue that my tiny monkey brain has failed to grasp but google has failed me in this instance.<br /><br />All help appriciated!

Truecrypt ships with tails but is disabled by default - at the boot screen press tab and add a space then type truecrypt, once tails starts it will be available under accessories IIRC.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in installing a VM via virtualbox in tails its actually not that hard BUT be warned that you need to update the kernel headers! I can&#039;t say for sure this is all that is needed but it works enough to let me install whonix (but I haven&#039;t tried an actual OS). Once I get a USB stick big enough to hold the whole thing I&#039;ll update this.<br /><br />I think that using persistence in read-only mode should stop any potential security problems but if anyone can make downloaded packages persist I would be interested to know, I cannot get virtualbox to persist!

				SSBD - Sorry for the late reply mate, I was having trouble trying to install the latest Tails - ended up in bed at about 3 this morning fucking around with it :P <br /><br />First, the line that says &quot;OS Boot Manager&quot;, is that an entry you can select? Select it if you can, then let me know what options you are given, or just try them if you think they will work.<br /><br />Make sure your BIOS settings regarding Boot Load Priorities are something like the following, <br /><br />1st: USB<br />&nbsp;2nd: CD/DVD-ROM<br />&nbsp;3rd: HDD<br />&nbsp;4th: anything else<br /><br />also make sure Legacy USB options are enabled.<br /><br />this link has some excellent, well worded information:<br />http://www.pendrivelinux.com/usb-bios-boot-options/<br /><br />quotes from link:<br /><br />Newer BIOS Boot Menu:<br />Many newer computers detect the USB device as a hard drive (USB-HDD0). In which case, you can press a specific key (F2, F10, F11 or ESC) during system post to access the &quot;Boot Menu&quot;. Select your USB DISK from the Boot Menu and resume startup.<br />Older BIOS Setup method:<br />If your system is a bit older or uses a simplified BIOS, you may not have a Boot Menu option. In this case you will need to make the system detect and boot your USB device by changing the settings in the BIOS.<br /><br /><br />So maybe if you have a newer computer (2009+), try changing the boot order in the BIOS settings back to what it was (typically: HDD then CD/DVD then USB) and just use only the Boot Menu to select your USB (without going into BIOS settings)<br /><br /><br />also, these links could help if still having troubles:<br /><br />http://www.pendrivelinux.com/testing-your-system-for-usb-boot-compatibility/<br />http://www.pendrivelinux.com/recommended-usb-flash-drives/<br />http://www.pendrivelinux.com/booting-linux-from-usb-zip-on-older-systems/<br />

				Iv never really looked into Tails much, Is it just for Linux OS? <br /><br />On my Laptop with my vital info i use Truecrypt, I LOVE IT..<br /><br />ON another laptop iv been playing with (DESCKCRYPTOR&quot;)&lt;&lt;&lt; WHAT do you all feel about that? is it secure? Only thing i dont like about it is, u have to mount it on the comp that the program is on, its not like you can take the usb youv encrypted with it to another person house.. Only downfall i see. What if any do u feel about that program&gt;?<br /><br />Good? semi good? No Good.. I feel its semi good for the reason i stated above. Trucrypt would have to be my Fav at this point..

Liberte is locked down, you can only act as root for 2 minutes after booting and then only if you enable root login at the boot menu. If you want to put anything else on liberte you would have to make your own build. Liberte (used to at least) randomize your MAC address every time you booted it (though tails does have a MAC changer I think) though I vaguely remember their being some debate about how useful this feature was.<br /><br /><br />Tails allows you to add anything that can be used with debian and allows you root access for an entire session.<br /><br />There are many developers for tails but only 1 for liberte - whether you think that is an issue or not I don&#039;t know but tails is certainly more widely used and presumably this means problems will be noticed and fixed quicker (hence the endless new releases).<br /><br />So really it depends on what you need from the distro. I used to use Liberte but I changed to tails as it allowed me more options to try different software/tor options and so forth.<br /><br />Naturally and as usual the final choice is one you have to make yourself.

				To add to the Ro-Jaws&#039; nice list, Tails uses TorBrowser, which is used by the entire Tor community and undergoes a lot of security auditing, while Liberte rolls its own torified browser, which has comparatively little testing. How do you know it isn&#039;t leaking info about your browsing activity? I trust it a lot less.<br />

				The whole point with Tails is that you have to trust the tails dev...<br /><br />If the goal is to use it as a persistent USB system, add apps and the like, I feel like it might be better to install debian (encrypted with luks) on a USB key, with the TBB &amp; the proper firewall rules - and take a few ideas from tails, wiping the RAM for example an getting rid of the bash history and stuff like that. You get something that&#039;s easy/safe to upgrade - and you start with the debian packages themselves, that have been audited by the community.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I like with Liberte, it&#039;s that you can create your own easily. Though I didn&#039;t really like it when I did test it, and would rather use Tails (but not sure about whether I trust em or not) or good old debian...

				i notice that the latest version of tails offers obfsproxy which in theory i believe prevent isp from seeing you are even using tor? i hope i got that right.so can anyone who is tech savvy as i certainly arent answer this for me please.<br /><br />so if my above statement is correct would this work in preventing my isp from seeing my tor activity? <br /><br />press tab on bootup, press space write bridge at the end of the text and press enter.<br /><br />this would then prompt me to set up bridge mode in tails. i got 2 obfs2 addresses off torproject. i saved them to text in my persistence file following the tutorial above which was awesome by the way. <br /><br />So every time i boot into tails i press tab type bridge on boot up i enter the two obfs2 address into my network settings and off i go.<br /><br />is this correct?

First problem was that upon booting up the virtualmachine it saw the ova files which were saved in truecrypt although would not load them. so in essence if my system was comprised they could still see the ova files.<br /><br />secondly once in the whonix station i could not save any files on it from outside the virtual machine.<br /><br />then there was all the hassle of trying to get kgpg working in it, plus trying to get obfsproxy and a bitcoin wallet installed on it. i still have it saved on my laptop so i am going to keep playing around with it.<br /><br />imo and as i mention i am shit with computers, it would have been a good set up but i just couldn&#039;t get it to work to my satisfaction without having to use other programmes as well,for me it all got too messy.<br /><br />someone who is more clued up will probably have more success and i see some do use it.so i am in no way suggesting peeps dont use it if they know what they are doing.<br /><br />tbh unless i am missing something with this tails setup, by using the truecrypt option,by adding bridges and by installing electrum onto it, i hope i have a pretty save setup that prevents peeps seeing i am using tor and keeps my bitcoin save.<br /><br />i have added a link about gpg in tails, in case you havent seen it.<br /><br />CLEARNET---https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/index.en.html<br /><br />I havent found any obfs3 bridges yet either.

				That&#039;s interesting about the bridges not persisting. Its not something I have ever noticed since I use a non-persistent version of tails so re-entering the bridges is par for the course. I had forgotten about it going straight into tor, which of course means you have to enter the bridges then shut down and restart vidalia to go throught them (perhaps simply switching to a new circuit would work but as you said - better safe than sorry).<br /><br />Thanks for the info about whonix, especially the truecrypt thing, something to watch out for.<br />I think your problem with the whonix workstation was simply part of the way it is designed. Its designed to run on an unsafe machine and thus does not allow communication between the VM and the host. I expect you could override that and change the NAT settings or set a shared folder or summat but if you don&#039;t know what your doing (like me) you would likely defeat the whole point of running whonix in the first place.<br />On a side note I think whonix does support obfsproxy but you have to edit torcc directly.<br /><br />Thanks for the link but its not that I can&#039;t use gpgapplet, just that I don&#039;t like it. Mostly because you can&#039;t see what you have encrypted - it just takes whats on the clipboard and for me the clipboard is somewhat unreliable in acknowledging what I have copied. so I might well send someone a message containing my password, a chunk of text I was interested in or the gpg commands I append to gpg.conf. Terminal lets me see both the message I started with and the finished product plus it lets me armor it at the same time. Easier all round (for me at least).<br /><br />That set-up sounds pretty good to me. Seems like a good balance between security and usability for your use of SR and related activities.

				sure<br /><br />the basic structure for commands is always:<br /><br />gpg [options][commands][filename] - you can combine various options but only 1 commands at a time<br /><br />There are a couple of ways to encrypt to a given public key but I usually start with<br /><br />gpg --list-keys<br /><br />then<br /><br />gpg --encrypt notarealfile<br /><br />and then type in the name associated with the correct key<br /><br />Of course there are a million extra options you can append to these commands but I have taken to adding these lines to my gpg.conf before use thanks to an extremely informative discussion about identification via ciphertext analysis elsewhere in the security forum:<br /><br />throw-keyids<br />trust-model always<br />utf8-strings<br />no-greeting<br />no-emit-version<br />no-comments<br />no-mdc-warning<br />armor<br /><br />Here is a list of the more usual commands&nbsp; - http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Operational-GPG-Commands.html#Operational-GPG-Commands but for use on here most of them are entirely unneeded. <br /><br />This does not cover importing, exporting or generating keys in the terminal because the key manager in tails is similar enough to gpa that its not worth using the terminal.<br /><br />Hope that helps<br /><br />

By the way, watch out with throw-keyids can cause issues if the recipient doesn&#039;t know whats going on as they get prompted over and over again for their password. Its also a little redundant for normal SR use though its certainly not without its uses for particularly sensitive messages.

				Thanks so much for this tutorial Fallkniven!<br /><br />I am currently accessing tor through my Tails USB! I&#039;m running into a few problems/confusions however. If there is any advice anyone can offer, please, I would greatly appreciate the help!<br />Here are my questions:<br /><br />1. I went through the steps to configure my usb for persistent volume. Upon rebooting, I was able to start tails with my persistent volume (via my passphrase) and it opened up rather quickly with no problem. However, with every subsequent reboot, I enter my passphrase to run tails with the persistent volume, and it loads for a long time at the log-in page and never opens up tails. I&#039;ve only waited about 5 minutes total, but the first time&nbsp; I rebooted it took only several seconds. I went ahead and deleted the persistent volume. I will reconfigure, but is it normal to wait several minutes to get through the log-in when starting tails up with the persistent volume?<br /><br />2. I&#039;m a bit confused how I can copy files into my persistent volume. When I configured, there were general choices to save things like pgp keys, network configurations, etc. I selected everything as per the Fallkniven&#039;s tutorial recommendation, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be anything saved onto the volume. How do I copy files to the volume? Can I copy anything I want, say like a word document or pictures that are on my HDD? How so?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

Try formatting and re-installing Tails is the only thing I could recommend as I have not had this problem before. I believe that the settings files and other information stored in the persistent volume by Tails are hidden by default, you can open up the volume just like Windows Explorer from the &#039;Locations&#039; menu at the top of the screen.

				i have got also a problem, my obfs2 bridges wont be saved, i have to put them in every time i reboot, and this is kind of annoying, isnt there a way that all your preferred bridges will be saved too? In my persistent volume configuration i have marked &quot;Network Connections&quot;, i thought this would be what i was looking for, but it still wont save them :/ <br /><br />and although i have marked &quot;network connections&quot; i have to put in my network password every time i reboot, is this normal? <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think Vidalia is set up to save its settings in the persistent volume - this could be a general oversight by Tails authors, or it could be a security issue. You can check the Tails Forums to see if there are any threads on the subject. Unless someone else has found a way of making the Vidalia settings persistent, you will have to enter them manually every time :( <br />https://tails.boum.org/forum/<br /><br />The password you mention is a temporary session administration password, allowing you access to system functions and other admin stuff, including access to addon Disks. It is reset each session for security, it is normal to have to enter it in on every boot. Try logging in to Tails without the password and go about your business, if you run into any problems you can always re-boot and use the session admin password, it is not necessary unless you specifically need admin access.

If a user wants to use only bridges to connect to the Tor network it makes sense to be able to store their bridges as a persistence option.

The ciphers are ordered by strength (ie, safety), and as you can see, CAST5 is pretty far down the list. The advantage of using CAST5 is en/decryption speed and compatibility with many encryption programs. I err on the side of safety.<br /><br />Of course, as always, your encryption scheme is only as good as your password.<br />

				Tails v. 0.18 is out today!<br /><br />I burned the new iso to a dvd and booted it. I then inserted the same usb stick that I had the previous version of tails copied on. Upon running the Tails usb installer, I choose the Clone and Upgrade option this time instead of the Clone and Install option, because I already had Tails installed on the usb. My persistent volume was maintained, just checked, all files that I copied are still there, no problems!<br /><br />Was this the correct way of going about updating Tails on my usb, choosing Clone and Upgrade, or should I have choosen a different option? I notice the last option when running the Tails usb installer says: Upgrade from ISO.<br /><br />It seems like with this option you would not need to burn the new version of tails onto a dvd. Couldn&#039;t you just boot the old verion of Tails from the original burned dvd that you used (or extra usb that you used), proceed to applications--&gt; system tools --&gt; Tails usb installer --&gt; Upgrade from ISO --&gt; browse --&gt; access the downloaded new version (0.18) iso image from your hardrive --&gt; then upgrade your usb.<br /><br />One thing I notice is that if you boot into tails with the main usb that you are using and then try to &#039;Upgrade from ISO&#039; with the same main usb device, you cannot choose the same usb you are running tails with as your targeted device in the tails liveusb creator window. So, to upgrade you will need two devices either way. However, is there any reason you shouldn&#039;t use the original dvd or usb that you burned with an old version of tails to boot into in order to &#039;Upgrade from ISO&#039; when updating your main usb with a new version of tails. I guess this wouldn&#039;t matter much if you are using two usbs, but this would save on having to use a new dvd every time to first burn the new version onto when updating your usb.<br /><br />Anyways, the new version of tails is running great! Lots of little bugs are fixed from the last version.<br /><br />-entreterra<br /><br /><br /><br />

				part of the tutorial they should show silkroaders how to use macchanger on tails. i used to use liberte linux becuase all mac&#039;s were changer as soon as you loaded it. <br /><br />qucik question does anybody know if tails go thru any alternate routes i.e. if isp blocks tor? or if the goverment blocks tor? on regular tor you can give alternate routes if it is bloacked but wonder if tails does it automatically.

				part of the tutorial they should show silkroaders how to use macchanger on tails. i used to use liberte linux becuase all mac&#039;s were changer as soon as you loaded it. <br /><br />qucik question does anybody know if tails go thru any alternate routes/bridges i.e. if isp blocks tor? or if the goverment blocks tor? on regular tor you can give alternate/bridges routes if it is blocked but wonder if tails does it automatically.

				Fallkniven,<br /><br />So is the general idea here an unencrypted USB which contains an OS that has an encrypted volume in it? Or is it possible to encrypt the whole USB itself? I would prefer the latter, but I think that would complicate things as far as booting goes. Plus you didn&#039;t suggest it. I&#039;m just not sure if it was understood that the USB should be encrypted with TC beforehand. I would very much like to know about this, since I&#039;d prefer to have all my storage systems, even if they don&#039;t house sensitive data, encrypted either way.

				I&#039;ve never tried to encrypt the entire Tails USB drive before, personally I don&#039;t see the point when using a separate encrypted volume/partition.<br /><br />There may come a time though when one must try to hide the fact that Tails is installed on the USB in question, in which case it would be very pertinent to encrypt the entire drive. I am unsure how to go about this for Tails specifically, although I have used TrueCrypt on a Windows system and it functioned extremely well.

				It would be an extra layer of security. You could do a hidden volume with it on Tor; no one would ever know you had anything to hide if they DID obtain the drive and you had to give them &quot;a&quot; password. Owning tails definitely implies you&#039;ve got something to hide, and if attackers could enter into your tails OS and see you have an encrypted volume (I&#039;m not sure how this works. Whether you first login to tails, then the encrypted volume, or if your tails password is just the password to the encrypted volume? And there is just no password to enter into normal tails like a hidden volume?), then there could be problems. Although, I don&#039;t know how it works, like I said. If it is like a hidden volume where you have no pass (or a dummy pass) for your regular tails OS, and then another pass for your persistent volume when you&#039;re prompted for a pass after the tails boot, then that&#039;s a different story. But either way I would prefer someone didn&#039;t know I had tails in the first place (implies hidden files that no you don&#039;t want people to see), not to mention it&#039;s an extra layer of security. You protect all of these things with strong passes and you&#039;ve got a layered security system that would take ages to crack brute force style, no?<br /><br /><br />What I&#039;m interested to know tho is whether or not you could still boot from your USB if it was encrypted, but still had tails and everything on it. Basically, your system, but with an encrypted USB stick. I don&#039;t know if the comp would even recognize the usb at boot, though, given this model, or if it will but can&#039;t boot, or if it would just be a matter of entering the passphrase to decrypt the USB (although I doubt this last one very much). And I don&#039;t think it could boot off an encrypted USB, because that would defeat the purpose of encryption (you&#039;d get straight to tails anyway). So is this practical, or no? It sounds like no, but I just wanted to ask more experienced users of tails what they thought could be done, if anything.<br />

				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I wanted to thank Fallkniven and all of the other smart people who have contributed to this thread. I have been running TAILS and now I have just gotten set up to connect via obfs2 bridges. My understanding was that my before adding bridges, my ISP could pretty readily determine that I was using tor, especially since I live in a sparsely populated area. Not that they would be tracking that, but I don&#039;t trust them. From what I have read about obfuscated bridges, I am feeling more protected now. <br /><br />Someone mentioned in this thread the existence of next level obfs3 obfuscated bridges. I am not a technical expert, so I have no real understanding about what that means, or where to obtain obfs3 addresses (I got 4 obfs2 addresses from the tor project website). Additional info about obfs3 would be appreciated.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks again everyone.

				I haven&#039;t read all seven pages but I am wondering if anybody has had much success running TAILS with persistent volume on an Intel based iMac?<br /><br />I have but quite accidently and only after hours of fucking around.<br /><br />1. I made a bootable USB drive with TAILS and a persistent volume. (Tested on non mac and works perfectly)<br />2. Installed reFit boot loader on iMac ((or reFind, one or the other) Can already boot into OSX or Ubuntu)<br /><br />Will not boot into TAILS from USB despite the bootloader recognising it. Tried over and over. Will not work! <br /><br />3. Burned TAILS to a DVD and booted iMac from the DVD (The above USB drive was left in iMac). This worked and TAILS booted! <br /><br />HERE&#039;S WHERE IT GETS GOOD.<br /><br />4. It asks for my pass to access the persistent volume and successfully loads it.<br /><br />So, for all those who cannot get Intel based iMacs to boot TAILS with a persistent volume from a USB drive just set up the persistent volume on a &#039;regular&#039; computer THEN leave it in you Mac as you boot TAILS from a DVD.

				Bridges can be hit or miss. I&#039;ve grabbed bridge IPs that didn&#039;t work, then I grabbed some more and they worked. If they don&#039;t work for you the first time, you can try new ones.<br /><br />Will regular bridges mask your Tor use from your ISP?&nbsp; Yes, if they are only looking at IPs. If they are using deep packet inspection to examine the stream, then probably no. But if you&#039;re in a western country, chances are very high they&#039;re not looking at your Tor use in the first place.<br />

				It&#039;s not possible. TrueCrypt only supports system encryption of Windows operating systems. See here:<br /><br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/sys-encryption-supported-os#Y0<br /><br />The way to do it on Linux is with LUKS/dm-crypt, but it&#039;s more complicated than encrypting the volume. The boot partition has to be unencrypted in order to boot the kernel to decrypt the rest of the disk / volume, and currently the boot folder&nbsp; is part of the unwritable Tails system image.<br /><br />The Tails developers would have to modify the default Tails configuration to support it.

				I have a quick question on bridges:<br /><br />If these are public, and anyone can start one, could certain bureaucracies not start one? It seems way less secure than a VPN would be. A VPN is a trusted company. in an entirely different country. A bridge is just some random IP address from someone who you do not know. This is a very shoddy way to do tor&#039;s so-called &quot;circumventing&quot; of the powers that be.<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to think, as far as flying under the radar and staying low profile goes, that a non-tails setup would be far superior. Yes, it has it&#039;s disadvantages, but so does tails itself. I believe tails is useful for those who believe that it is inevitable they will face LE at some point. I do not believe this to be the case for myself (unless using tor becomes a crime, which, given the current system, doesn&#039;t seem too unlikely).<br /><br />Hiding tor use from the &quot;big picture&quot; that these bureaucracies hold in their databases is absolutely essential. You can and will be placed on a list; if not now, you will eventually, for using tor. This hugely narrows down the search, as astor explained in another thread. However, I am not comfortable with astor&#039;s suggestion of using bridges. It seems far too easy to me for people with malicious intent to set up a bridge (entry node?) and at least know you&#039;re using Tor, if not for them to be able to monitor the connections you are making (silkroadvb5piz3r.onion? Yes, let&#039;s put him/her on the list). I am not sure about the latter, though, as I am no tor expert. Maybe someone else could weigh in.

				I&#039;m no Tor expert either but I can take a stab. As far as I know even if a bridge was malicious (or an entry node) they cannot see the content of your traffic. The traffic is encrypted before it gets to the network so a bridge/VPN would see only encrypted traffic, not the content, otherwise malicious entry nodes/ guards/bridges would be a massive potential problem (actually they are but not because they can read all your messages straight out of the connection).<br /><br />Why do you assume a VPN is going to be more trustworthy? Sure a bridge could be bad, but so could a VPN. Just because they charge you money and promise not to log anything certainly doesn&#039;t make it so. For all you know they break as fast&nbsp; as Microsoft and throw your data at any LEA that comes near them (they are hardly going to brag about it).<br /><br />Staying off the radar is a good idea but I&#039;m not sure why you think tails puts you on it? If you can secure another system to your satisfaction then go ahead but tails does most of it for you if you lack the know how and does it well considering its threat model.<br /><br />Actually if you want to stop ever ending up on the radar you should be using something like whonix or your own annonymizing middlebox, so even if you an exploit gains access they can&#039;t get your IP, just the box&#039;s.

				hello all,<br /><br />1st.)&nbsp; Thanks to the OP for posting a good piece on what I consider to be one of if not the safest method(Tails), but I&#039;m no cryptologist. <br /><br />&nbsp;There has been something thats has bothered me since skimming through the first pages a couple days ago and I&#039;m sorry if it has already been addressed.<br />I noticed a question about plug-ins and desktop customization and other ways to make your tails pretty and the OP responded by saying if the person found a way to keep these changes persistant over reboot&#039;s to let him know.<br /><br />**OP&nbsp; PLEASE DO NOT TAKE OFFENSE AS NONE IS INTENDED, I would hate to see someone make fingerprinting of themselves that much easier because they like specific fonts or backgrounds/colours etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />BAD ADVICE:&nbsp; NEVER CUSTOMIZE YOUR TAILS DISTRO!!&nbsp; unless of course you want to weaken its core purpose, keeping you SAFE.&nbsp; <br /><br />*Use the default settings other than JS, which should be the first thing you do as Iceweasel opens after you connect. In Iceweasel, open preferences &gt; Content and&nbsp; un-check &quot;enable Javascript&quot;<br /><br />**&nbsp; these are settings and recommendations are by people with much more knowledge than me or the OP &amp; they are there for a reason.<br /><br />&nbsp;I like to customize my personal OS a bit like most, but!&nbsp; to do so, or feel the need to on tails means you&#039;re missing the point.&nbsp; Do not make yourself unique.&nbsp; No font changes, no unique terminal profiles, be careful about add-ons and such.&nbsp; I hate the default background colour but I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d hate the colour of my prison cell worse so I deal with it.&nbsp; just my .02btc

				A few people have cited issues starting tails from Apple products, including Macbooks.<br /><br />Simply insert the tails disc before shutting down. Hold down the &#039;c&#039; button as the computer turns on, and it will automatically boot from the disc.<br /><br />Pretty simple, really.

				Hey,<br /><br />So I&#039;ve been trying to set up a Persistent LiveUSB for Mac for what feels like forever now.&nbsp; I have heard many people bring this up here in the forums, but not many people have very much information on it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been able to boot up a Tails LiveCD, but it is not persistent. <br /><br />So I&#039;ve made a LiveUSB using a Sandisk Cruzer 4GB, using Tail&#039;s built in Live USB Creater (while using my LiveCD).&nbsp; I turn my computer off, plug in this LiveUSB, and then turn the computer back on while holding the option key (with reEFIt installed on a macbook pro). Then I see a menu and select the penguin with a label &quot;Tails from Linux&quot;.&nbsp; Once that is selected a penguin appears and begins to load, but then my screen goes black with the message &quot;Missing Operating System&quot;.<br /><br />This has happened every time and it&#039;s so frustrated, I&#039;ve tried recreating the LiveUSB, Redownloading the Tails iso file, and trying reEFIt and reEFInd, but I always get the Missing Operating System message.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated...I&#039;m sure i&#039;m not the only one with a Mac who is trying to set this type of system up.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Oxidizer&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been told TAILS is the most secure method for browsing SR/Darkweb.... but how is having an USB with an obvious Hidden/encrypted partition laying around safer than a simpler truecrypt file container with multiple key-files which are all disguised as legitimate files, including the container.<br /><br />-Both can be bruteforced, with the password length/complexity being the time-length estimate.<br />-The truecrypt file container with multiple unidentifiable keyfiles combined with an extremely complicated password would be a million times harder to crack. Not to mention they have to identify and find the file that is encrypted in the first place!<br /><br />The only downside with the truecrypt container is that you may as well have to delete and readd your keys to your keyring and store them somewhere secure each time you need to use them so they&#039;re not found in your keyring... even though I&#039;m pretty sure certain GPG/PGP keyring applications can be set to load the keyrings from specific locations.<br /><br />So what am I missing here? I have read all 11 pages and understand how tails works and how to install it, yet I fail to see why it is so much superior. Having tails on a usb proves that you have something to hide. Having a Linux-OS with truecrypt and an empty key-ring says nothing other than the fact that you&#039;re using linux that has some security-based programs on it that may as well have been default on the installation.<br /><br />I am not trying to defend my method of security here, but rather I am trying to understand what I am not understanding that makes tails so much more secure than the aforementioned methods.

Having a Linux-OS with truecrypt and an empty key-ring says nothing other than the fact that you&#039;re using linux that has some security-based programs on it that may as well have been default on the installation.<br /><br />I am not trying to defend my method of security here, but rather I am trying to understand what I am not understanding that makes tails so much more secure than the aforementioned methods.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey, same argument being made at the Tails Forum...<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/forum/Persistent_Truecrypt_+_encrypt_entire_system_drive/

For example, if you open a document that is stored in the encrypted file, it may be added to a Recent Documents or Recent Files list in whatever program. <br /><br />Take a look at the traces that the browser bundle leaves behind on Windows:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148291.msg1152452#msg1152452<br /><br />Presumably some of those traces are left behind when it is run from an encrypted file too. Full disk / volume encryption, where there is no unencrypted area to leak data to, is much safer.<br /><br />But Tails isn&#039;t really about the encrypted persistent volume. That&#039;s just one feature. Even if Truecrypt volumes were just as good or safer, the reasons to use Tails include:<br /><br />-- it&#039;s Linux, so there&#039;s effectively no malware to worry about &lt;-- this is the main reason it&#039;s safer<br />-- it transparently torifies network connections&nbsp; &lt;-- the second biggest reason<br />-- it comes with many apps that are configured to use Tor<br />-- it implements new Tor features early, such as obfsproxy bridge support and stream isolation<br />-- it never touches the main hard drive, so there is absolutely no data leakage<br />-- it&#039;s run from media (DVD, USB) that is easy to get rid of<br /><br />Tails is definitely safer than running TBB from a Truecrypt file on Windows.<br />

				I have been using tails today and configuring it to my liking, though the one thing I cannot get over is it&#039;s obviousness. I just wish they would make it not like......&quot;Hey lookie here intruder, this here is an encrypted drive. Do you want to try to guess the password to the encrypted part or log into the decoy part?<br /><br />Seems kinda like the first thing the creators of tails would have done is make it so it doesn&#039;t look suspect when booted?

				Fallkniven - okay, reset the preferences and checked the browser under confirgure persistent volume and it saved my bookmarks<br /><br />now for the last assist request (bear in mind, i&#039;m an idiot on this stuff - what i&#039;ve done so far not only took me 12-15 hours over 3 days, but at least one bottle of bayer aspirin - <br /><br />loading gpg4usb - i tried downloading directly to persistent volume via iceweasel (ie saving file), and then opening it while downloading, and the only selection was to use &quot;archive manager&quot; to open with. In either case when i hit the &quot;start_windows.exe&quot; file, it opens what looks the debian version of the text editor in gpg4usb with a choice of 3 files,&nbsp; but no &quot;encrypt&quot; or decrypt options on the task bar<br /><br />????? is there another way i should be installing gpg4usb on tails usb?<br /><br />thanks in advance

				GPG4USB is designed to be used in Windows, Tails is a Linux based operating system, it wont work &amp; you don&#039;t need it anyway...<br /><br />Tails comes with an encryption/decryption applet, it&#039;s the clipboard icon in the task bar, it works differently to gpg4usb but it is no harder to use once learnt.

				Yeah, why not just use the built in PGP app in Tails?<br /><br />But if you really want to use GPG4USB, you need to double click the file start_linux, not start_windows.exe.<br /><br />First it has to be made executable by right-clicking on it and Properties -&gt; Permissions and checking &quot;Allow executing file as program.&quot;<br />

				one more question - i&#039;ve looked everywhere on how to make an adjustment on display size on my desktop and can&#039;t find anything - the display screen image is short on the right side by about an inch (black border on right side) but i can live with that. The actual screen image is &quot;taller&quot; than the screen by a considerable amount, so that when i minimize iceweasel or electrum, it disappears at the bottom , ie below the viewable area <br /><br />it&#039;s been something of an issue when, for example, i&#039;m scrolling bookmarks, open a folder and can&#039;t get to the bookmarks below the bottom screen&#039;s edge<br />or when there&#039;s a choice i need to click on whatever screen, where the choice is at the bottom<br /><br />i can pull the scroll bar on the right down all the way, and even though i&#039;ve got it stuffed to the bottom, there&#039;s part of the display hidden<br /><br />is there anyway to correct this?

				went to system&gt;preferences&gt;monitors and at least found what it might be - resolution was up at the highest 1024 X xxx, - i tried setting it to 640 x 480 and it made the problem much worse. iirc, this screen is a 1680 x 1200 or somewhere in that region, resolution wise but there were only 3 choice in &quot;monitors&quot; with 1024 being the highest<br /><br />best way to explain it, in windows when you minimize a program, it drops down to a small icon on the lower left, i guess what you&#039;d call the lower task bar - well, whether in normal debian or windows camoflage, there is no lower task bar and there&#039;s part of what should be displayed on the screen below the lower edge of the monitor - so if i want to maximize iceweasel back to full screen, i can&#039;t - i have to hit the icon at the top and sometimes it brings the page i had up, before minimizing, and sometimes it reopens iceweasel back to the home page.<br /><br />&nbsp;it&#039;s kind of like having a 16&quot; tall picture and you&#039;ve overlaid a mask that has an opening only 14&quot; tall -<br />so that you can&#039;t see the bottom 2&quot; of the picture

				I finally did it! This is a dream come true for me! I have an important question though- Tails has a built in PGP encryption tool. How do I use it? I read there&#039;s absolutely no reason to get another PGP program outside of the Tails one. Okay cool but now where is it and what do I do with it? Also, I kept getting pop-ups saying webpages aren&#039;t encrypted and that anybody could easily see my activity or something like that. Is this something I should be worried about? I just clicked the &quot;do not warn me again [or whatever]&quot; box.

				The part with the webpages being unencrypted is fine.. I&#039;ve talked to several people, and they all said they encounter the same thing when browsing Tor via Tails...<br /><br />As for using PGP on Tails, your going to need to...<br /><br />1.) Create a password for your secret key, and setting up a secret key by clicking on the little tablet that is to the left of where you click to connect to Wi-fi. In there, you will find a glossary of sort describing to you how you set up your own personal key..<br /><br />2.)&nbsp; After you do that, your going to want to find other peoples&#039; public key and paste them into the third tab in the encryption applet labeled &quot;other keys&quot;. You will need to sign there key, which will prompt you to enter a password again.<br /><br />3.) In order to encrypt messages open G-edit under applications&gt;accessories- third one down... type in your message, go to edit at the top and go down to Encrypt. It will then ask you who to send it to... once you decide who to send it to it will prompt you to enter your password you set up earlier.<br /><br />4.) Decrypting is done in the same way as encyrpting, basically. All you need to to is paste the encrypted message you are trying to decrypting into G-edit and click on edit up at the top and this time click on decrypt instead of encrypt. I think it will prompt you to enter the password you set up earlier.<br /><br />5.) And last step would be to send others your public key so that way they can communicate with you. This is accomplished by clicking the second tab in the encryption applet, going to the second tab labeled &quot;my personal keys&quot; copy&nbsp; and then paste it into G-edit and it will generate your public key for you... then copy and paste your new public key to whomever you are trying to communicate with.... and Voila, should be good to go!

				helpmywife, the most likely reason is that you are not putting &quot;obfs2&quot; or &quot;obfs3&quot; before the IP address.<br /><br />Normally when you add bridges, you enter something like this:<br /><br />12.34.56.78:433<br /><br />But for an obfs2 bridge, you enter:<br /><br />obfs2 12.34.56.78:433<br /><br />Also note when you go to bridges.torproject.org that the obfs2 and obfs3 bridges are listed separately from normal bridges. Not all bridges support the version 2 and 3 protocols.<br />

Of course, an thumb drive is relatively easy to get rid of, flush it down the toilet, throw it out the window. You could have time to get rid of it even in a raid.

				Nice tutorial Falkniven. So far, everything works like a charm. Thanks a lot for that.<br /><br />I just tried to input a obfs3 bridge to Tor. For that, i thought to shut down Tor / Vidalia. So i right click on the Tor icon on the top and choose &quot;exit&quot;. Then i recnogized, that in the background(?) Tor must still running, because i am still able to access this forum. What should be the correct way to do that?<br /><br />I dont use a wireless network. I connected to a LAN wire. After Tails has started, i have to connect to the LAN manually. If i would use WiFi, Tor would connect automaticially and would start Tor, before i could enter the bridge. <br /><br />So i am wonder, how is the correct way.

				I believe you hit &quot;tab&quot; while Tails is in the section where it just loaded and you have to choose between two options 1. I think is starting Tails normally 2. Is starting tails in a safefail. When you at that screen hit &quot;tab&quot;.

				Ahh ya I heard that you have to update the bridges every time you run Tails again. But I&#039;m not a computer tech so there might be a way to upload bridges while it is running. But I really don&#039;t see it likely considering you would want to open the bridges before connecting to Tor, not while it is running. <br /><br />Thanks for the link&nbsp; :D

				Hi all.<br /><br />I have run into a bit of a problem in my efforts to set up a Tails Usb.<br /><br />I consider myself as an advanced Windows user, and whenever i experience problems of any kind, a bit of research and logical sense will almost always provide a solution.<br /><br />I started out by creating a Tails Usb, from windows and it worked like a charm on several machines. However i wanted to have the persistent volume feature, and went on to acquire another usb i could set up from inside Tails. Once this was done i formatted the first usb, and also set that one up with persistent volume.<br /><br />So far so good.<br /><br />But now my laptop (Which was originally intended to run all my Tor activities from now on), is refusing to boot from either of the usb&#039;s! (It had no problem before the persistent volume feature).<br /><br />I am beginning to feel like i have tried everything short of formatting the entire Pc, but I still can&#039;t get it to boot up!<br />As a last resort i tried to make a Tails dvd, and again that seems to work like a charm. I then proceeded to create another Tails Usb from the laptop itself, while running Tails (To see if this could get it to accept it), but that wont work either!<br /><br />Whenever i try to boot from the usb, the laptop will just ignore the boot order and boot into Windows anyway! This seems to be the case no matter what i do, accept if i make the hdd first boot priority, and then, when booting, hit F12 and manually select the usb (so I am bypassing the hdd entirely in the boot order?). In this case it will just say that there are no operating system found!<br /><br />In my attempt at fault finding, i have discovered that windows seem to create an error message whenever i try to boot from usb but it boots windows instead. This error message goes something along the lines of &quot;ACPI BIOS Is Attempting to Create an Illegal Memory OpRegion starting at 0x0&quot;, and while i have been trying to seek for solutions, I cant seem to find any that is applicable for my situation (most recommend updating BIOS, but i am already at the newest version).<br /><br />I have also been looking at advice in this thread, but after working with this for ~ the last 26 hours, I must admit that I could easily have missed something.<br /><br />Hoping someone can provide some kind of advice, or guide me towards anything that might work.<br /><br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; ???

				Relays and bridges are run by volunteers, not by the Tor Project developers. Any of them could theoretically be run by malicious operators. There&#039;s a lot of research analyzing potential attacks based on this assumption. You&#039;re not 100% safe using Tor, you&#039;re just a lot safer than when you connect over clearnet or other anonymity networks (while still getting certain functionality). The whole point of entry guards is to minimize the threat of picking malicious nodes. The reason I strongly suggest using bridges as persistent entry guards with Tails rather than rotating guards with each session is to minimize the threat of picking malicious nodes. Using 2 bridges instead of 10, when 2 is all you need anyway, also minimizes the threat of picking malicious nodes.<br />

When you surf clearnet sites, your connection comes from a Tor exit node, and there are public lists of those relays. In fact, they are added to some block lists, which many web sites use, which is why you might be blocked from accessing some sites when using Tor.<br /><br />Tails isn&#039;t &quot;announcing&quot; that you&#039;re anonymous, it&#039;s just known by the fact that your connection is coming from an exit node. You can&#039;t hide the fact that you are using Tor from the destination site unless you point the Tor Browser at a web proxy, which would stand between the exit node and the destination site. But none of that matters. You are still anonymous within the set of all Tor users, which is millions of people. The destination site knows you&#039;re browsing anonymously, but it doesn&#039;t know your identity, which is the only thing Tor claims to protect.<br /><br />The Tor Project is actually against obfuscating the fact that you are using Tor. They believe you have a right to surf anonymously, but site operators have a right to block whoever they want from accessing their site, and you shouldn&#039;t be hiding the fact that you are using Tor from them.<br />

Sometimes when I&#039;m trying to change my settings around and shit I get a message saying &quot;System policy prevents modification of system settings [...]&quot; Then it asks for the &quot;Password for root&quot;. What the fuck is this &quot;root&quot; business?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Root is the Linux term for administrator or super user. It&#039;s telling you that when you are logged in as a regular user, you don&#039;t have administrator privileges, so you can&#039;t change system settings. In order to do that, you have to click the option at the login prompt to set an administrator (root) password.<br /><br />But you shouldn&#039;t be using Tails as the administrator. You should do normal activities as the regular user. The fact that root has no password set when you log in as a regular user is a security feature, because an attacker can&#039;t get root privileges on Tails by guessing a password. He would have to exploit a privilege escalation bug, which may be considerably harder.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I&#039;m normally connected to autoetho, then it disconnects and I haven&#039;t figured out how to connect again.

				Here&#039;s what helped me when I inquired about PGP for TAILS<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.msg1363189#msg1363189">Quote from: hielonite on July 21, 2013, 04:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The part with the webpages being unencrypted is fine.. I&#039;ve talked to several people, and they all said they encounter the same thing when browsing Tor via Tails...<br /><br />As for using PGP on Tails, your going to need to...<br /><br />1.) Create a password for your secret key, and setting up a secret key by clicking on the little tablet that is to the left of where you click to connect to Wi-fi. In there, you will find a glossary of sort describing to you how you set up your own personal key..<br /><br />2.)&nbsp; After you do that, your going to want to find other peoples&#039; public key and paste them into the third tab in the encryption applet labeled &quot;other keys&quot;. You will need to sign there key, which will prompt you to enter a password again.<br /><br />3.) In order to encrypt messages open G-edit under applications&gt;accessories- third one down... type in your message, go to edit at the top and go down to Encrypt. It will then ask you who to send it to... once you decide who to send it to it will prompt you to enter your password you set up earlier.<br /><br />4.) Decrypting is done in the same way as encyrpting, basically. All you need to to is paste the encrypted message you are trying to decrypting into G-edit and click on edit up at the top and this time click on decrypt instead of encrypt. I think it will prompt you to enter the password you set up earlier.<br /><br />5.) And last step would be to send others your public key so that way they can communicate with you. This is accomplished by clicking the second tab in the encryption applet, going to the second tab labeled &quot;my personal keys&quot; copy&nbsp; and then paste it into G-edit and it will generate your public key for you... then copy and paste your new public key to whomever you are trying to communicate with.... and Voila, should be good to go!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.msg1366760#msg1366760">Quote from: hielonite on July 23, 2013, 03:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think the way to get your public key is to open the PGP applet.

				Hi all, been on the Road for a while but just recently decided to go through with it.&nbsp; (I think) I got my persistent drive all set up and ready to go.&nbsp; Just have a couple n00by questions.&nbsp; Whenever I click to submit a piece of information, for instance my log-in info to get on the SR, or when I click the post button on the forums, it comes up with a notification telling me that I am sending information over an unencrypted server and it could easily be read by a third party.&nbsp; Is this indicative of a bad installation or is this just the nature of me submitting anything using my internet and happens to pretty much everyone?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I should probably be asking this in the Electrum tutorial thread, but the issue is more related to tails i think.&nbsp; When I try to configure my persistent volume to add the /home/amnesia/.electrum to my persistent volume, I don&#039;t have the option to add anything new, it only allows me to select or unselect what type of files I want to be saved into my encrypted partition(Personal data, GnuPG, SSH client, etc.).&nbsp; <br /><br />Just yesterday I installed tails for the first time, so I am running on the new 0.20 update.&nbsp; I apologize in advance for the noobie questions.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty lame when it comes to computers and I really appreciate what all of you guys do here in this forum.&nbsp; Without you guys I&#039;d practically be a sitting duck for uncle sammy to make an example of.

				Thanks to livestrongs nice little pm iv got my head around pgp with tails seemed pretty straight forward once i gave it a try.<br /><br />Now for my next question :s..I&#039;m using tails through a DVD and every time i switch it off and restart i have to set everything on it up again. For example i made a pgp key and saved it as a file sent a message then shutdown, once i restarted the file saved was gone and i need to make a new key. Theres no way that i will have to do that every time i go on tails is there? Is there a way to permanently save files?<br /><br />Any guidance will be appreciated :)

				So i downloaded Tails and the USB installer, and booted from the USB but it always gets stuck at the same point.<br /><br />It gives me the option of Fail Safe Tails and regular tails for a second or two and then boots, and a black screen with a loading bar and &quot;debian&quot; in the bottom right comes up. The bar loads, but then freezes once it is fully loaded. <br /><br />Any ideas? <br /><br />I used the latest version of Tails and the installer, should i be using an older one?

After i click create, the computer just freezes and nothing seems to happen. Is this a problem with not having enough system memory? I&#039;m using 512MB on a disposable laptop. Thanks for any help.

Will i always need to keep the disc in as well to use the usb or I&#039;m i missing something?<br /><br />If this is explained at the start i allow you all to cyber-slap me

				Can somebody help me out with a fairly simple Tails issue?<br /><br />Have been having some trouble figuring out how to get an address encrypted, then output in the ASCII character mode in the LiveUSB Tails. Installed and followed every instruction to the dot, the problem is that I am fairly unfamiliar with the Linux/Tails OS and need help figuring this last piece of information out. <br /><br />Thanks to all Community members! Have a good day you guys<br /><br />Found my answer guys: To all future users here is the information<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography/index.en.html<br /><br />Hope this helps out!

				This worked so well for me for so long on my Windows 8 computer using the following method, but now it&#039;s broken, any advice?<br /><br />1. Set boot mode to legacy and change boot order to USB stick as the first one.<br /><br />2. Download universal USB installer and the most recent TAILS.iso. Install onto USb stick after formatting.<br /><br />3. Restart computer and hold shift while restarting to enter the UEFI Boot mode. Choose to boot from the disk.<br /><br />Now here&#039;s where things get weird, usually I get one &quot;boot device not recognized&quot; error, followed by me selecting the USb stick as the boot device again on a different screen, and then TAILS will load. BUT NOW when I follow all of these instructions with the newest version of TAILS on a diff USB stick I get a &quot;No boot device error&quot; and then am unable to go any further.... any advice?

				About 3 boots or so after upgrading TAILS, my drive has stopped working. I get all the way to the white and blue (two shades of blue) loading bar then the bar just gets all white and doesn&#039;t move on. That&#039;s my stick with a persistent volume. I&#039;m on my stick without it right now. I din&#039;t have anything too important on it so I&#039;m okay if I lose the info on it but what do I do? I&#039;ve tried cloning and installing as well and cloning and upgrading from the no persistent volume stick to the persistent volume. At this point, I think my best option it to just format it and start over. My normal OS doesn&#039;t recognize the TAILS USB when plugged in though so how do I do this? Any other appropriate suggestions are welcome.

				@livestr0ng<br />Maybe your USB stick is crap. Try booting it more often. Also stick it into another USB port. <br />Anyway, the information on the persistent volume may not be lost. It&#039;s probably possible to copy it to another USB stick. Don&#039;t ask me how though, I don&#039;t use Tails.

				This worked so well for me for so long on my Windows 8 computer using the following method, but now it&#039;s broken, any advice?<br /><br />1. Set boot mode to legacy and change boot order to USB stick as the first one.<br /><br />2. Download universal USB installer and the most recent TAILS.iso. Install onto USb stick after formatting.<br /><br />3. Restart computer and hold shift while restarting to enter the UEFI Boot mode. Choose to boot from the disk.<br /><br />Now here&#039;s where things get weird, When things are working properly I get one &quot;boot device not recognized&quot; error, followed by me selecting the USB stick as the boot device again on a different screen, and then TAILS will load. BUT NOW when I follow all of these instructions with the newest version of TAILS on a diff USB stick I get a &quot;Missing operating system&quot; error and then am unable to go any further.... any advice?

				So the whole point of using the &quot;Tails USB Installer&quot; from a bootable DVD is to set up persistence, right?<br /><br />OS X seems to be having trouble identifying the USB device with the cloned TAILS, so would it be okay to just use the &quot;first TAILS&quot; and keep all my keys in another USB?<br /><br />Anyone who had success with OS X, any help is much appreciated :)
