				Hi,<br />As MTgox is not accepting cash deposits now in the UK, has any tried https://blockchain.info/wallet/deposit-pingit it looks like a reasonable alternative, just seeing if anyone has tried/tested it. Only other problem is a paper trail is there any extra security methods that we can use?

				I&#039;m very interested to hear about this service too, will probably test it out myself in the next few days and report here.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know of any extra security measures for staying anonymous while using that service but for me the paper trail of sorts isn&#039;t necessarily a deal breaker since I don&#039;t really see how someone could prove what you&#039;re using the bitcoins for and it&#039;s not illegal to get bitcoins.&nbsp; Even if questioned I&#039;d just say it&#039;s for online gambling.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t use that for large orders though or get too comfortable with it.&nbsp; The £250 a week limit wouldn&#039;t affect me much personally but I can see how that&#039;d be problematic for those who regularly buy bulk.&nbsp; I just hope that MtGox get their act back together soon and this will just be a temporary or alternative service that isn&#039;t too costly.

				Having gone through the process of registering with Pingit, it would appear to be a dubious option.<br /><br />Having entered all your personal, they then request that you take one form of photographic ID and a proof of address before you can use the service.<br /><br />Don&#039;t waste your time.

				Im going to try the ping-it/blockchain method soon, Ive also been BTC-blocked by mtgox.

				I wasn&#039;t asked to present any ID or proof of address either, at least not yet.&nbsp; It did say though that I&#039;d have to perform some additional verification if I spend over £2000 or after a year has gone by.&nbsp; I made my first BTC purchase with this method today and it worked out great.&nbsp; I was surprised with how fast this method works.&nbsp; Literally within a minute or two of using the app I had the bitcoins in the wallet, and got a decent deal on them too.&nbsp; In the end I only paid a few pennies more than I would have on MtGox with the GBP bank transfer method.&nbsp; I will definitely stick with this service while it works until MtGox or Intersango get their act together in the UK.<br /><br />I am pretty upset with MtGox as they lost track of quite a bit of my money that I sent them before they stopped taking UK bank transfers.&nbsp; I contacted them about it politely in several emails and they replied saying they would trace it and credit me with it or send it back, so on and so forth, but now several days/almost a week has passed and I haven&#039;t heard anything from them or received any money either in my MtGox account or as a refund to my bank account.&nbsp; They haven&#039;t responded anymore to my emails about it either which is slighlty worrying, I&#039;m starting to think they&#039;ve lost my money for good.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll use them again if I don&#039;t get the money back one way or another.&nbsp; Has anyone here had this happen, but gotten the money back or credited to their MtGox account?&nbsp; Can an organization as established as MtGox legally just rip people off?

				Hey new user here. Joined the site a few days ago and went nuts trying to get bitcoins, which was apparently impossible in the UK. In the end I used ping it- it took a few hours to process there and a few more to get transferred here, but in the end everything went smoothly. Cost about £7/BC, and they didn&#039;t require any ID. Seems to be the best option for UK users at the moment.

				Yep, it works....<br /><br />Have a Barclays Current Account, with online banking, and a registered, current mobile number with them. During install/ payments using the app, I was not asked for any verification or ID. <br />Made a payment of £250 (yes, all the way) but wasn&#039;t until almost 18 hours before I saw the coins in my account. Apparently it was a glitch in their system. <br /><br />If anyone is worried about anonymity and privacy, they should send the coins, once in their BlockChain Wallet, to &quot;BitCoinFog Company&quot; - as that adds an extra cloak of security. They take a small percentage and a few hours of your time, but its worth it if you&#039;re slightly paranoid. <br /><br />

				@japan mine took 24hrs to show the ref but some people were lucky and it showed within minutes. @optical not sure about cash deposits but I wouldn&#039;t risk it. I tried an online banking payment and it got bounced back to me so was fine but obviously a cash deposit can&#039;t do that if there are any problems and it could take awhile to show in you mtgox account. Best thing to do is email them and ask.

				Strange thing&#039;s happened with my Mtgox...<br /><br />Yesterday I tried to transfer a certain amount of money to them - it bounced straight back. 10 minutes later I tried again, with a slightly different sum of money - once again it bounced back. Now I&#039;ve just checked my online banking and both amounts have been taken out my bank by Mtgox......<br /><br />I wonder why they took both amounts without informing me after both amounts bouncing back? I wonder if I&#039;ll get my BTC&#039;s or I&#039;ll end up with a few hundred quid floating around in cyber space until they sort their shit out?<br /><br />Bit of an odd one - not sure if I&#039;m pleased or pissed off.

To be totally honest, I wouldn&#039;t risk it. What I&#039;ve heard is that Intersango and MTGOX are both having/ had problems with taking UK, GBP deposits. To my mind, this means online, walk-in, whatever, I&#039;d rather not risk it, especially not with the amounts I purchase in one go! <br /><br />And Japan1980... I wouldn&#039;t worry. It&#039;s currently the weekend. The funds may have been taken out of your current a/c, but MTGOX will likely be returning them (with the difficulty being it&#039;s currently the weekend). I&#039;d say if funds aren&#039;t in your current a/c by Wednesday, then that&#039;s reason to have concern. Good luck

				@Japan1980&nbsp; MtGox has a lot of my money too that I transferred to them a few days before they announced they are no longer accepting deposits to their UK bank account.&nbsp; I am worried it&#039;s lost because it&#039;s been well over a week since it left my account, and they stopped responding to my email/support desk questions last week.&nbsp; I can only hope I get it back eventually but so far it&#039;s really not looking good.&nbsp; Please let me know if you get yours back.&nbsp; I am definitely quite annoyed at them, the least they could do is give some kind of explanation as to why they&#039;re not giving it back, or when they might be able to do so.&nbsp; Very unprofessional for such a service, if you ask me.&nbsp; I had a similar thing occur with a different ecurrency exchanger years ago and they kept me posted and reassured, and I got my money back when they promised.<br /><br />@optical1 They&#039;re no longer accepting UK bank transfers, meaning that if you want to send them money from a UK bank account you have to send it to one of their international accounts which costs a lot more than it did to send to their former UK account.

				I&#039;m giving this a go, just waiting for my REF to show up.<br />I presume everyone sends the coins from Blockchain to SR using the anonymous feature? It costs 1.5% but IMO that&#039;s worth it..<br />(Use Send Anonymously to guarantee the transaction cannot be traced between sender and receiver).

				Just had an email from blockchain support and they admitted there&#039;s a software problem on integration between pingit and blockchain. They said though the majority of transactions are going through ok there are three other people in the same boat as me. They said the owner is back on the 5th and asked me to be patient till then. To be honest i&#039;ll be royally pissed off if they think this is ok. If my money isn&#039;t there or returned in the morning then i&#039;ll take action<br /><br />I really wanted to order something tomorrow and won&#039;t get paid till friday so it will leave me without&nbsp; :-\

				Have just set up the pingit service with barclays to my phone. The only process i had to do to verify who i was was go to an atm with my card, and follow the prompts for the pingit service. Fairly easy really. Anyway iv set up the blockchain account, gonna purchase a few bitcoins tomorrow during bank hours to avoid delays. Looks promising however and pretty much as convenient as mtgox once its all set up as long as you dont need high purchases which is an obvious problem with the £250 limit.

				^ This<br /><br />I seem to be the only person who hasnt had problems verifying myself on the ping it service. I was given options on the phone app, one of which was visit my nearest barclays atm and quote a code showing on the app and my phone number. Easy really. If i was asked to show photographic proof i would of still gone ahead, its a service to your bank account. Its not solely for bitcoins...

				Ok so I entered the REF and it&#039;s asked me to hand over some ID, to be fair I won&#039;t be using this app just for bitcoins, it seems pretty useful for other things so I&#039;m going to go ahead and do it I think.<br />When I send over the bitcoins I&#039;ll use the anonymous service though and send it to bitoinfog before I send them to SR.
