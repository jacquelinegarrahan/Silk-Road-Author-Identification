Also, as long as you&#039;re padding your mail box with dozens of other uninteresting packages, a few deliveries a week from SR won&#039;t stand out. <br /><br />Imo the safest route is to stay small, and make sure your mail always has at least a package or two (or more) waiting. If you&#039;re constantly receiving small items from eBay or Etsy or whatever anyway, any illicit packages won&#039;t stand out so much. <br />

Just think, what if the 1st package gets caught? You wouldn&#039;t want to have any more coming to the same address.

				I agree with Rastaman, it is not worth the risk in my books, all though it&#039;s hard you just have to be patient sometimes.

				I think the question is how much are we talking? People get a lot of packages delivered all the time. I&#039;m not saying to not be safe of course and that is a good point; if one gets found out, you&#039;ve got a real problem on your hands. However, if you&#039;re ordering safely from vendors you have trust in, they usually are wrapped with more care than some legal parcels. I just got a package last week from a foreign country and one from Amazon on the same day and the package from overseas was boxed and clean cut. Amazon must utilize first graders to wrap their shit sometimes...
