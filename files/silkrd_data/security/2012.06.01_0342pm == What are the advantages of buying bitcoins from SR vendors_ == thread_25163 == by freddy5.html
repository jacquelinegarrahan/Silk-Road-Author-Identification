				I&#039;ve been reading lots of info on bitcoins and obtaining them, etc as I haven&#039;t yet made a purchase and really just want to absorb as much information as I can before I do. Recently I&#039;ve noticed that there are plenty of bitcoin vendors here at SR and it seems like lotsa people decide to do buisness with them in turn, but why? What do the SR vendors offer that other alternatives don&#039;t?<br /><br />If you buy bitcoins from a vendor do the bitcoins show up directly in your SR account? <br /><br />Better yet, because I&#039;m still seemingly confused about much of the bitcoin nature, exactly how do you buy from a silk road vendor?

				Some immediate benefits that come to mind are anonymity and speeding up the process. It would be a good idea, if you haven’t already, to read the relevant forum traffic on the matter--it will make you informed. Most any vendor, I think, would prefer an informed buyer vs. the obvious alternative.<br /><br />SR Administration seems to consider the bitcoin exchangers here on the Road as just above law enforcement on the scale of respect. I’m basing this statement on their published posts.<br /><br />When evaluating a bitcoin provider, it boils down to risk assessment. Established commercial exchangers will usually cost more, and there are lots of active threads on the recent trend of those vendors requesting personal ID.<br /><br />Commercial sites like GetBitcoin and BitInstant are two examples that use the model of an anonymous bank deposit in exchange for bitcoins. There are some SR vendors that use that model as well. The commercial routes will sometimes cost more in fees and time than SR vendors, not always. Moneypaks in exchange for bitcoins is another popular route, but check the fees. Cash-in-mail, and all the rest? It’s all here in the forums, waiting to be perused.<br /><br />Good luck in your shopping!<br />

				The biggest benefit I&#039;ve seen is speed and the fact that it actually happens.<br /><br />MtGox/Dwolla have stolen almost $3000 from me. They just keep passing the blame. Meanwhile, I have no money.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather just get an MP Code from BTCPal or some such. No bullshit. Done in hours. Far more trustworthy than any of the &#039;official&#039; methods/services.
