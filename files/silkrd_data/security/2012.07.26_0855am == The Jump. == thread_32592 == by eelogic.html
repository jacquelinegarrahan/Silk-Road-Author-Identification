Tor is legal to use and so is SR if you are only buying/selling legal items. You can always take on more drastic security measures, but don`t think that is necessary in your case. I`m going to be selling some art too, so I hope to see yours up soon. <br /><br />If you will be buying drugs or other items, its best to be secure.

				Stating the obvious for potential buyers, if you&#039;re buying legal goods from the same account as illegal goods you should be just as secure as you would for the illegals to avoid compromising security overall. Or better yet get a separate account that can&#039;t be linked to your first account to minimise risk. Or even better, do both of these.<br /><br />Good luck to both of you selling your art :)
