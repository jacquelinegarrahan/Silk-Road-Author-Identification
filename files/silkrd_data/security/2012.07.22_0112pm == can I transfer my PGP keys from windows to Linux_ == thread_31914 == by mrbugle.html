				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve just made myself a Liberte on a USB but I still have GPG4USB running on windows. Its supposedly a linux version as well but i can&#039;t get it to load.<br /><br />Is there a way to export my keyring to a different program or directly into Liberte or get gpg4usb to run in Linux?<br /><br />and also, do you guys encrypt your address for the address box in SR when you place an order?<br /><br />I like to work things out but these two have me stumped. Never can be too safe hey?

				Definitely. You need to export your private keys. Then on the other computer, you need to import those private keys. Then you can use them, providing you know the passphrase.<br /><br />Note that the private key is considered sensitive information. Don&#039;t just email it to yourself. Either put it on an encrypted volume and transfer that. Or create a new key pair on the computer where you want to use the keys, then email the public key to yourself and import it on the other pc (the one that contains the keychain). Then email it to yourself encrypted with your public key.<br /><br />And yes, always encrypt your address using GPG. If there is a leak in TOR security (not likely, but not impossible either), then you&#039;re address won&#039;t be out in the open.

				thanks for the help guys, I spent ages buggering around trying to get different programs working when I discovered GPA pre-installed on it. It was corrupt so I reinstalled my whole liberte, but now everything is working perfectly.<br /><br />my windows install is so fucking corrupt its not funny and this runs much better.. I will reinstall soon but meh, you know what reinstalling is like, its a pain in the ass.<br /><br /><br />I feel very very anonymous on SR now, thanks for your help.
