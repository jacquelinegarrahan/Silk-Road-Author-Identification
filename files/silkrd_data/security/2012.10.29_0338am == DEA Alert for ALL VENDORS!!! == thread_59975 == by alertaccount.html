				Hello SR,<br /><br />I am a vendor on the site but am making this alert under a throwaway account as it&#039;s likely DEA will see this post, and I&#039;d prefer not to stand out from the pack... I have heard from another top vendor on the Road who recently ceased his business due to an order that was placed - from Army Navy drive in Arlington, VA, an address he later realized is the headquarters of the DEA - ordered directly to their headquarters.<br /><br />Please be advised that the DEA is actively placing orders, and particularly beware of orders outbound to Arlington.

				The DEA uses undercover PO boxes registered to fake identities when they place orders....surprisingly this is also what you should be doing! This can be seen from operation raw deal if anyone needs verification read up on that.

				this doesnt matter, pay no attention to this person just trying to incite drama and fear<br /><br />every vendor should always approach every single order as if it was placed by LE... <br /><br />so what if the DEA ordered from you? if you are doing things correctly that is completely inconsequential<br /><br />standard packaging procedures dictate there being absolutely no way for them to connect the package to the person who sent it <br /><br />if there is a way for the delivery to be tied to the vendor, then they are not conducting business properly <br /><br />wear gloves to prevent fingerprints, dont use a traceable printer, dont lick the envelope, make sure you arent leaving hair in the package... obviously they dont use their own return address, etc and there is absolutely nothing to worry about <br /><br />just say thank you for their money... hope they enjoy the drugs, you know the DEA uses drugs too - everyone does... even if they think waking up and consuming a socially accepted stimulant in a beverage that some poor south american toiled for basically nothing to produce and then later having a legal alcoholic beverage and then going home to beat their wives and kids from their frustration over their pointless hypocritical job wasting their lives away is more acceptable than the non violent users of drugs the government said we cant use for ill informed racially intolerant reasons

				glad you found it humorous :)<br /><br />i just have a problem how bud is schedule 1 with its proven medical uses, and was outlawed by some racist lying politician trying to deter stereotyped hispanics from immigrating to the US... which now means when i need to smoke some bud for my nausea and increase my appetite from my GI condition, i am a criminal that risks being imprisoned amongst murderers, rapists, and violent pedophile kidnappers. what kind of fucking bullshit gov agency wastes valuable taxpayer money infringing upon a states rights to make their own laws and steal the states potential revenue from taxing the bud by seizing a natural plant&nbsp;

				I expect it was somebody who found it funny to have drugs delivered to the DEA headquarters. It is quite a statement. As a vendor, you have three options:<br /><br />- send it to them&nbsp; (if you are confident about your shipping not tracing back to you)<br />- take the money and don&#039;t send drugs (don&#039;t ever do this with a regular customer, but this prank puts you at risk, and the drugs will get destroyed anyway)<br />- refuse the order and give the customer his money back (the honest thing to do)

				I don&#039;t see what the problem is just ship the order?<br /><br />If your worried about your shipping methods being traced back to you then your in the wrong game and shouldn&#039;t be selling to anyone period.
