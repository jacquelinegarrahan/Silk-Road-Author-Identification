				Does anyone know of an anonymous paid VPN service that doesn&#039;t require details? I want an additional layer of security so that my ISP does not know that I am using TOR.

				privateinternetaccess.com<br /><br />No traffic logging. Has endpoints all over USA, EU, and Asia. Accepts payment in bitcoin with nothing required more than an email for the receipt. Supports OpenVPN, IPSEC, L2TP, and PPTP VPN protocols. Uses dynamic IPs instead of static that rotate at randomly decided intervals to further anonymize your traffic. Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iPhone. Full Gigabit Bandwidth through VPN ports. Optional Socks5 Only Proxy (to keep regular traffic unencrypted). Cost is currently $40/year.

Just trying to clarify this before someone misinterprets it and begins spreading FUD.
