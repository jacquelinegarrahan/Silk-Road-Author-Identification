				Define &quot;safe&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />So here&#039;s what I do (just to give you a good starting point)....<br /><br />I go to BitInstant.com and input the amount in $$ that I want to use to purchase (don&#039;t forget there are fees and commissions involved....so have enough to cover EVERYTHING, including shipping from the vendor).<br /><br />I choose to have my BTC delivered via email.&nbsp; Once I go to WalMart, fill out the blue express form for MoneyGram, giving false name/address/phone.&nbsp; Use a different phone # each time, they keep a database and can see your previous transactions each time you return.&nbsp; With a new number, they have to enter your &quot;name&quot; and info each time.&nbsp; If it&#039;s under $900 (in my state at least) they don&#039;t have to verify ID.&nbsp; On the back of the blue MoneyGram it tells you the limits for this, for your state.&nbsp; Some are $1000....<br /><br />If they ask you for ID, tell them you don&#039;t have ID on you, and point to the back of the form where it clearly states you don&#039;t need to provide ID under that amount.<br /><br />You don&#039;t get charged for the MoneyGram from WalMart, the $3.95 that BitInstant charges covers that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Within about 5 minutes (normally less), you receive a link in your email that you can click, and then enter your payment address.<br /><br />I personally use a Bitcoin Wallet (from bitcoin.org) to transfer to, which washes the coins 6 times.&nbsp; I then transfer from that wallet into my SR account, which again....washes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have done it like this more than 5 but less than 20 times.

I have always got my coin this way and can vouch for Sugar Mama, btc buddy, and BTCpal. They do this all day long every day of the week, and I have never heard of them accused of ripping anyone off.<br /><br />and yeah, unless you think your caught up in a federal conspiracy no one is tracking down your Moneypak purchases.

I don&#039;t believe moneypak is traceable, but essentially the moneypak and BTC can&#039;t be linked so yes it&#039;s completely safe.
