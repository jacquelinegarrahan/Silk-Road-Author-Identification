				Where can you keep large amounts of product but still have easy access to it?<br /><br />Digging hole&#039;s, ripping hole&#039;s in walls, storing at a friends house are all out of the question.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of doing the storage unit but I don&#039;t have a fake ID to use.<br /><br />Any tips?

				Well you could always GET a fake id and proceed with the storage unit plan, but seeing as you already mentioned it and discarded that idea I&#039;m assuming you won&#039;t do it.<br /><br />One idea is you get get a waterproof lockbox of some sort and store anything illegal in there, and toss it into a nearby pond. Maybe even put a GPS chip just in case some one takes it (probably not worth it unless we&#039;re talking really high volumes here). Of course, I&#039;d recommend that you make sure that neither the lockbox nor anything inside it can be traced back to you (fingerprints, buying history, etc).<br /><br />I mean, your location is really important here. If you live in a city, the above is more or less out of the question. In that case I&#039;d go with getting a fake id for a storage unit, because there&#039;s no other plausible way to store it outside your house (which you really really want to do) in a way that won&#039;t get caught.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Storage unit in the U.S. is a BIG NO NO!<br /><br />They can be searched by management at most locations with no rhyme or reason. They see you coming and going &quot;too much&quot; OR NEVER see you...they will look. <br /><br />Remember, you are only renting. The unit is THEIR property! They can do whatever the hell they want, and one thing they will do is call some guy that care once they find some shady shit in there.<br /><br />The only POTENTIAL exception is if you actually have a storage unit full of crap. House crap. Then have a &quot;big trunk&quot; buried at the bottom of the pile that you actually go through the effort of digging out to get to. and PUTTING BACK when done. Can&#039;t get lazy, even once.<br /><br />A lot of modern &quot;24 hour access&quot; storage places now have electronics gates that you are given an &quot;access card&quot; (RFID if im not mistaken). that means every in and out is being recorded. Do they check those records regularly? I wouldn&#039;t want to find out. <br /><br />If they DO and the &quot;usual person&quot; is in and out during daylight hours..say once a month (avg).&nbsp; Then there is you who is in and out always at night and more then once a week. once a week even is way too often to visit a place that you essentially rented because &quot;you got too much crap in your house and this is all the crap I don&#039;t need that often.&quot;<br />How much (weight) are you talking about? 1kg? or 20 or 300kg?
