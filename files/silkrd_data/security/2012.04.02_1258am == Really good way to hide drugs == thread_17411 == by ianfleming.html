				I just realized a great place to hide drugs.<br />This will not work with things dogs alert on easily, but should be perfect for some types of speed, RCs and things like LSD.<br />Get a vibrator that takes AAs, hollow out a double AA and put the drugs in it. Most police will not want to mess to much with a sex toy. (this is great for travailing).<br /><br />also, did you know that most batteries are the same voltage (1.5volts) this means you can have a flash-lite that takes Cs or Ds, but with a hollowed out battery with a AA or AAA in the center. The flash-lite will still work (though not for too long) yet you can put a nice amount of drugs in the hollow space inside the D or C battery.

				Those batteries are full of tar and their fuel cells, not pretty or fun. Get a can safe. like a fanta or something. they sell them in the same shop as dildoes usually<br />

				Well, someone made it work. Also, you don&#039;t need to put another battery in a bigger battery; as long as the power of the next/previous battery in your flashlight/whatever can conduct *through* the stash batt, it&#039;ll still work. Kinda like bridging a fuse with some wire...<br /><br />EDIT, forgot the link:<br />hxxp://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/hstrrtfcts/rtfcts/trdrtfcts005-eng.asp

				I don&#039;t think the stash would actually need to even conduct, a hollow battery should act like a faraday cage, were all the electrons move to the outermost layer of the outer most layer of the battery and flow across the surface.

				Or you could just wrap drugs in aluminum foil I bought some weed once and just stuck it in my flashlight which I was carrying on me.

				1. In my admittedly-not-vast experience, LE could care less if an object is a sex toy. Maybe would avoid it if it were... funky... or something. On the other hand, that&#039;s why they wear gloves.<br />but. otherwise?&nbsp; It&#039;s just another iPod to them. <br />Please also remember the high % of female LE who are comfortable with sex toys.&nbsp; I really, really wouldn&#039;t count on avoidance there, based on some of the interactions I&#039;ve seen/had. More like an encounter group.<br />If this were attempted, though, your best bet might be a Fleshlight or similar, strikes me as most likely to result in avoidance by both sexes in that context... I&#039;ve never taken one of them apart and I don&#039;t know what they look like on XR (science fair project for the month!), but there are obvious spaces in between the lining and shell, for example. The density of the filler is the problem. Would want to line the shell evenly, in the case of a powder, probably with another hard shell.<br />/household tips<br /><br />2. I recall batteries being considered a common deception method, sometimes with another battery inside when used as a single battery. Look in old Micrograms, etc., I don&#039;t recall reference. Will scare it up later and edit in. But it&#039;s a standard dog sniff - in scent challenge for dogs, the battery smells were some that the doggies had to get used to. (I don&#039;t know about police dogs, I just have had a series of smart pet dogs who have been scent trained to combat boredom, and the K9 officers sometimes lead groups for that when asked.)<br />

				We used to make these in the 80&#039;s :)<br />Panasonic brand batteries used to be the easiest because they had a metal sheaf that was easily removable, they were great for acid and pills but you couldn&#039;t fit much in the AA size. I recently got a box of stash batteries online and they are useless, totally unrealistic looking. Here&#039;s a link to them, they look ok on the web.<br />http://www.cleoltd.net/stash-battery-shape-dsize-with-point-of-sale-display-12pcs-p-11480.html

				for in-home storage, I removed the center hinge from a closet door, and used a dremel to route out the door frame under the top hole all the way to the bottom of the hinge area a couple of inches deep. I then cut the heads off of two of the screws and soldered them to the hinge on the back. then I cut the 3rd screw down to only have a couple of threads left. put drugs in hollowed area, fold hinge back into place, and re-install the now shorter top screw into it&#039;s original hole. it is easy to get to, and easy to hide.

Unless you use tactical psyops like the other guy in a different thread suggested by covering your apartment in minute quantities of drug dust and bits of weed to throw off the dog hitting on everything<br /><br />edit.. I had my apartment searched for drugs by cops when I was living in a dorm and the guy I lived with was dealing. They went through everything, spent a lot of time on the fridge and bulky electronics like TVs, checked all the vents, checked the windows for the old hanging stuff by a thread out them prison trick, and checked the toilet/behind it and in the top area.<br /><br />Opened up every can and box I had and book. The only thing they didn&#039;t search was me, I had a bag of shrooms crotched in a panic lol.

				well, most of what I am interested in, dogs aren&#039;t. but YES, vac seal anything that dogs could smell. I can&#039;t seem to keep anything that dogs are trained for around long enough for the dogs to even show up...lol

				Get one of these instead of trying to hollow out a battery yourself:<br /><br />http://www.bewild.com/amaabamoandr.html<br /><br />Besides, lithium batteries are dangerous because lithium will ignite quickly when exposed to oxygen.
