				So, I&#039;m not sure what you mean?&nbsp; Are you saying that the download was replaced with another one, but the version number is the same?

				Well goddamn SS if you want to be technical about it. :) Guess it depends on the time zone of their server and your time zone. All the comments are on the 7th though, so it was probably late on the 6th.

				Yes, there were two updated versions released pretty close together, 2.3.25-1 and then 2.3.25-2. The latter was due to the TURKTRUST CA issue (two of the certificates in Firefox)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-0247-alpha-packages-available<br />New Tor Browser Bundles and Tor 0.2.4.7-alpha packages available<br /><br />All of the Tor Browser Bundles have been updated to Firefox 10.0.12esr in order to address the recent problems with TurkTrust certificates. From Mozilla&#039;s post:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TURKTRUST, a certificate authority in Mozillaâ€™s root program, mis-issued two intermediate certificates to customers. TURKTRUST has scanned their certificate database and log files and confirmed that the mistake was made for only two certificates.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not a Firefox-specific issue. Nevertheless, we are concerned that at least one of the mis-issued intermediate certificates was used for man-in-the-middle (MITM) traffic management of domain names that the customer did not legitimately own or control. We are also concerned that the private keys for these certificates were not kept as secure as would be expected for intermediate certificates.<br /><br />All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.<br /><br />There was also a new Tor 0.2.4.7-alpha release and all alpha packages have been updated with that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				LOL!&nbsp; Well I just don&#039;t know where you got the date of the d/l being the 7th, but when somebody starts putting conspiracy ideas in my head, I start looking for inconsistencies.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t mean anything by it :)

I checked my download history and I got the 2.3.25-1 on 12/25 (but it&#039;s possible I was just late upgrading it). I remember ignoring the &quot;New Update Available&quot; message for a while... maybe I wasn&#039;t worried about it yet because I hadn&#039;t been *ahem* perusing the &#039;Road much before then&nbsp; ;D
