				OK so BTC hit $49 dollars briefly this morning. This is way hyper inflated based on speculation in my opinion and its making me afraid to pull the trigger on buying more.&nbsp; If I do I want to get that shit turned into product ASAP.&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid its going to crash soon and I dont want to be holding BTC that I payed over 30$ for.&nbsp; The bear is going to come out the window of this four story building.&nbsp; What do you guys think about this bubble?&nbsp; I wish I was more liquid back at $10-$12 I was gonna buy a hundred then.&nbsp;

				You are not alone in wondering what will happen, the price of BTC is climbing at unprecedented rates, the last few days alone has seen incredible rises, I am literally watching the balance in my SR account grow by the minute.<br /><br />Right now I can only speculate that demand is driving the increase and a lot of people are holding onto their coins as the price sky rockets. For the &#039;bubble&#039; to burst if indeed it is a bubble there would need to be some sort of significant event to precipitate a crash e.g. a major successful hack of coins thus causing panic and the flooding of the market as buyers sell off their coins.<br /><br />Markets globally are often influenced just by perception as people speculate on what they think &#039;might&#039; happen, right now the only direction seems to be up though and I can&#039;t see it slowing down anytime soon to be honest as more people clue into the potential gains to be had and hoard coins, something I admit I am now doing myself.<br /><br />This is of course just my opinion and I don&#039;t have any real facts to back any of that up so anyone with a competing view feel free to shoot me down in flames&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The only issue with volatility is that SR doesnt keep up with MTGOX 24hr avg, so you will see losses/gains in the difference. Im for one glad to see so much support for this new currency.

				likewise, I get a big grin when i see the figure in my account magically climbing every time i log in to SR. A lot of the increase has to do with global inflation driven by major economies expanding their money supplies to either meet debt obligations or maintain parity with the US dollar which is undergoing another round of QE. So while dollar values are pretty constant compared to the other main trading currencies, All currencies are falling in value at the same dramatic rate. People with any sense or spare cash are investing in real assets or items of fixed supply such as stocks, art, land, collectibles etc. Bitcoins are one of those items that fall into that category because there will only ever be x number of coins. People have seen the price of BTC triple over the last few months and this will only spur demand. I could easily imagine BTC hitting 200 by the end of the year

				My comment about the bear...Its been said that the bulls come up the stairs, the bears go out the window...or something like that.&nbsp; Although this recent BTC rally has been more like the bulls coming up the elevator, and I hope the bear doesn&#039;t show his teeth and drop the price of coins &quot;out the window.&quot; <br /><br />I just saw the first plunge on a candlestick chart since the $40 price point dropping from near 50 to 38.&nbsp; My prediction is that big players are going to take some chips off the table.&nbsp; Think about it this way, if you just made $100K in BTC, would you keep all your eggs in that basket?<br /><br />In case anyone was wondering why I started a thread in the &quot;security&quot; forum vs. the rumor mill was just because I for one don&#039;t feel &quot;secure&quot; buying or holding coins at these levels.&nbsp; If coin makes it back under 20 I&#039;m going all in.&nbsp; In the mean time, I&#039;m converting coins as fast as possible into less volatile things like drugs!

Lots of people are waiting on the sidelines to buy up coins if/when the price crashes under $30.

Either way I would have some cash set aside to buy in just in case the price does crash.

				I had posted some of this in another thread, and I&#039;d like input from you fellers on what you think about it.<br /><br />There will only be 21 million coins when they&#039;re all available, right? I figure the more people use bitcoin, that is the more it is accepted in the marketplace in general (far beyond drugs), then the larger proportion of the world economy will be taken up by bitcoin.<br /><br />Say it gets to 0.1% of the total world trade; supposing total world trade, including people&#039;s expenses, buying sprees, company expenditures, trade between countries comes to say, 20 trillion dollars (?). Then bitcoin will account for 20 billion dollars of world trade. 21 million coins, 20 billion dollars, gives some 952 us dollars per bitcoin. (I just modified my post as I had made a dumb math mistake.)<br /><br />If it were to get to 1% of world trade, that would put bitcoin at close to $10,000 dollars per coin! Course I don&#039;t know the value of total world trade, so this is highly approximate. If somebody knows the real number, please jump in.<br /><br />Does my logic seem flawed in any way? Does this make any sense? I invite criticism, by all means.<br /><br />But what if fiat money will become worthless (it will crash, all currencies, not just the dollar) in the not too distant future? This will make the attractiveness of bitcoin all the greater, and make it even more valuable as compared to all currencies, although probably not compared to precious metals like gold and silver. These two will increase incredibly in value as these things play out.<br /><br />goblin

If the current rise in demand and limited supply goes on for a few years then it could happen.<br />But there are many factors that you have to take under consideration. First of all you re talking about the far future, new coins will be generated for at least a century ahead, although to be honest in a few years the reward will be decreased a lot and its generation will be really slow. But in the meantime a lot of things could happen that could damage btc&#039;s value, some of those we can&#039;t even predict since we re talking about the far future. <br /><br />A new technology/currency putting btc in its shadow,&nbsp; a ban from big governments like US (they can&#039;t make it disappear but they can ban exchange sites/markets and killing its clearnet potential) and many other that we can&#039;t predict. There is also a speculation that big stackers that early adopted it are sitting on huge amounts and could hurt the market if they decide to sell, but imo if the demand is strong that wouldn&#039;t be enough to kill the value. <br /><br />The biggest factor is how people use and think of it. If&nbsp; btc usage spreads in many aspects of worldwide market and millions of people adopt it as a currency as it is intended to be then nothing can stop it. But right now it is mostly treated as a stock market meaning a good hit on it could turn people away and abandon the ship killing its value and forcing the rest to follow.

				BTC went past $50 today.&nbsp; So nice seeing that SR balance go up - what a great feeling!&nbsp; But definitely something to be wary of.&nbsp; As the great Warren Buffet said, &quot;be optimistic when everyone is pessimistic, and be wary when everyone is optimistic&quot; - or something along those lines.&nbsp; Reminds me of the time when I started buying tech and financial stock such as Apple (AAPL), Google, (GOOG), Visa (V), Bank of America (BAC), and Citibank (C), back in 2007 - 2008 when shit hit the fan; but, held on to them ever since and watched the numbers grow even as everyone else was freaking out about the recession.&nbsp; However, now being extra wary as folks are getting overly optimistic.<br /><br />Good luck investing everyone!&nbsp; Long live BTC and SR for eternity :)

				For my part, I seem to be mostly broke in the real world.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the folks at bitcointalk and other places devoted to the currency have been saying for awhile that the goal was that one day we wouldn&#039;t state prices in terms of how many bitcoins they cost, but in how many tenths of bitcoins they cost.&nbsp; I like the idea of remembering that the BTC is still tied to the USD, lending perspective to how much things should and do cost.&nbsp; So, while it&#039;s nice to see a little more cash in the SR wallet, there isn&#039;t this great run-up of prices on the Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can probably tell I&#039;m by no means an economist.&nbsp; It just seems to me that the more highly valued the bitcoin, the better for sales on the Road, BMR, and the exchanges which support the process.&nbsp; Yay!

				My opinion is that there is no bubble<br /><br />The btc stayed stable from September till the end of December last year.<br />I blame this on Pirate@40 who sold to many bitcoins and others who did see a drop in price coming did do the same<br />There were to many bitcoins on the market for the demand.<br />At the end of December it was done, no more rich guys willing to sell their bitcoins, so the demand stayed the same or in line as the demand is always rising.<br />And imporant the miners got no more 50 btc for 1 block but the reward was cut in half to 25 btc.<br />It will be cut in half every 4 years, to prevent that the supply becomes greater then the demand<br /><br />Many had set their hopes on the asic bfl of butterfly.<br />But they keep on delaying,<br />Promises are not kept, again and again<br />At the beginning of 2013 becomes second half of February.<br />They promised to deliver before the first of March, but could not deliver and the date became 15th of March which they could not for-fill too.<br />Now they had set the date that they would deliver their asic bfl rigs before the first of April.<br />Brokers bet that that date is not possible.<br /><br />So Butterfly labs seems to be a bunch of cowboys with a big mouth.<br />A lot of pre orders are paid already, often in bitcoins too.<br />All who have paid are pulling their hair out , and ask themselves why they didn&#039;t buy a asic from Avalon.<br /><br />Certainly those who paid after the twelft of January when it became clear that Avalon was able to deliver and did deliver.<br />Gamble on a wannabe like butterfly labs is just plain stupid.<br /><br />Sorry for those who spend their money the second half of January on a pre order by Butterfly labs, but it is one thing if you don&#039;t know, but an other thing if you do know.<br /><br />When Avalon asks 1299 dollar for a proven 68 ghps you are not that smart to give $1250 to Butterfly labs of which the delivery stays unsure.<br />I say plain stupid, but that is my modest opinion.<br /><br />Most likely this date will not be the date that they will start to ship out either, so everybody bet on the wrong horse, butterfly labs.<br />They are willing, but just can&#039;t get the job done<br /><br />While avalon (two chinese guys) deliver the one after an other and they promised their asic would work at 60 ghps, but their asic&nbsp; even works at a rate of 68ghps.<br />Even the price is the same or even lower, but their add campaign sucks.<br />As Avalon has produced almost 300 asic&#039;s, butterfly labs has still to deliver.<br /><br />The raise up was delayed as the bfl asic&#039;s of butterfly labs were expected to overflow the market with bitcoins again.<br />But as it became clear that butterfly labs could not deliver and kept delaying and set their shipping date on a later date again and again and probably again the overflow of bitcoins did not came.<br /><br />The demand keeps on rising, so the worth of the bitcoin has to raise.<br />Supply and demand<br /><br />In June 2011 the bitcoin was almost $30,- .<br />Now the rewards are cut in half December 2012 from 50 btc for mining 1 block to 25 btc that $30 dollars of two years ago (june 2011) has to double.<br />And back then not that much people knew about silkroad BMR pokersites and the bitcoin as such.<br /><br />Demand has tripled in those two years, since June 2011 when the btc was $30, so the price of $60 is not even fair.<br />It should be almost be $200,- if the law of demand and supply was implemented here.<br />But where high demand and low supply normally does do prces raise, it seems that only the reward change from 50 btc for 1 block to 25 btc for 1 block has been compensated.<br /><br />If the law of supply and demand was in place the btc would be now $200<br />If butterfly labs and other fpga asic companys fail to deliver the btc has to rise to $200 or more this year.<br />Only if the markets are getting more and more asic fpga&#039;s the rise of the bitcoin will then slow down.<br />But I doubt it and expect the bitcoin to be on a level of $200 soon.<br />Even with the delivery&#039;s of more and more asic fpga&#039;s will the bitcoin become $200 worth.<br />But then at the very end of this year.<br />If those asic fpga&#039;s are not sold soon a price of $300 , $400 or even $500 for 1 bitcoin becomes realistic at the end of 2013.<br />Once the supply of those asic fpga&#039;s is started will supply keep up with the demand and slow down this rise in worth.<br /><br />People are starting to save their bitcoins. If everybody start to spend their bitcoins the supply will keep up with the demand.<br />Money has to go around, the same goes for the bitcoin.<br />Once a few million btc&#039;s are coming on the market there will be enough supply for the demand, and that would bring the price down.<br />But never for the long time. If the btc drops, it will be only for the short time.<br /><br />The promised supply of bitcoins didn&#039;t came so the rise of the bitcoin is legit.<br />No bubble at all.<br /><br />Once Butterfly labs starts to deliver the price will not climb no more, at least not that fast.<br />There are just not enough people who are able to produce a asic bitcoin mining device to keep up with the demand.<br /><br />Only when some bitcoin millionaires start to dumb their bitcoins the price will drop.<br />Only and always for a short period of time.<br />Eventually the demand will catch up and exceeds the supply again <br /><br />As long this not the case the bitcoin will remain at a rate that is even more likely to go up.<br /><br />Money issues with the euro makes the demand even growing beyond expectation.<br />The more the bitcoin is known to the ordinary public like those Russian tycoons with their black or even stolen (mob) money, the more the demand will be and the more the bitcoin will rise.<br />People are losing their trust that their money on the bank is covered by the government.<br />Those governments claim that the money is safe at the banks, but that promise is hollow and they will not be able to keep that/their promise that the money is guaranteed.<br /><br />The euro is crumbling already and rich people can not carry their money if they change it in to gold.<br />Gold is to heavy.<br />Next best thing is a usb-stick with a koppel of hundred million of dollars or euro&#039;s, and that is only possible with bitcoins.<br /><br />Every other so called paper money, stocks or what ever can be adjust by printing more money and stock emissions.<br /><br />Money is owned by governments and banks.<br /><br />It happened in Roman times.<br />Emperors started to put less and less gold in their coins each time again and again, then the gold becomes silver and even paper.<br />Every two hundred years or so the money has to start all over again and there will be a new coin of pure gold, and soon there will be less end less gold in those coins.<br />Changed from gold in to silver and then the same thing happens to the silver and the silver becomes nickel or something.<br /><br />This story is thousands of years old and happens again and again.<br />Government try to hold on to their currency, so tax can be demanded.<br />Army&#039;s have to be payed and all those who work for the government.<br /><br />Only the bitcoin is free of what governments demand and easy to travel with.<br />To be used online and even stored there.<br />Or on a usb-stick or even a sd=card.<br /><br />Gold is to heavy and you can not push it trough the wires of the internet.<br />Bitcoins are so much better then gold is.<br />Gold can be mined and big country&#039;s can bring big amounts of gold on the market.<br /><br />There will be only 21 million bitcoins and after that they start getting lost, so there will be less and less of it.<br />Those governments will try to hang on to the euro but if the people decide to use bitcoins, that money can not be traced, so there is no way you can tax the bitcoin or as government demand something what is not there.<br />It may be there but nobody knows.<br /><br />If Cyprus and Greece find Spain , Italy and eventually most country&#039;s in the same position as they are now&nbsp; in the bitcoin will be more and more popular.<br /><br />It looks strange to have 8 zero&#039;s behind your 1 bitcoin, but when 1 bitcoin is worth a few thousand dollar or euro, you have to be able to give some change.<br />That&#039;s why there is not only a millibitcoin (one promille of 1 bitcoin, but there is already a microbitcoin.<br /><br />No bubble at all, I say.<br /><br />If history does what it always does and money does what it always have been done, there is a great future for the bitcoin.<br />Remind me in 20 years from know.<br />When the world is populated with the internet generation, and they will pulling the strings.<br /><br />Satoshi has to be a smart one.<br />Gold is for the old generation, I say over 20 years gold is history.<br />Bitcoin will be the currency.<br />No more yuan, rupee, yen dollar or euro but bitcoin will be the world standard. <br /><br />Flowing over the internet and no differences like gold has in the price in London, Hong-Kong or New york.<br />No need of banks to wire your money around the world.<br />No need of western union in every outback or bush bush.<br /><br />Bubble?<br /><br />There is no bubble.<br /><br />A new chapter in history has begun.<br />Internet is becoming increasingly more important by the day and now has its own standard.<br />Bitcoin is the new gold.<br />Its not just a currency.<br />It is the new gold standard. <br />No more tricks from governments that changed the gold-standard in the golDEN standard.<br />No more I owe u&#039;s, printed paper with a few zero&#039;s more or less when the governments pleases and decides to do so.<br /><br />Power to the people, there is a new dawn and the future looks bright with the bitcoin in charge!<br /><br />A revolution is unfolding,<br />No more money-trails. But anonymous untraceable new money.<br />The euro will be gone over 10 years, or will play a far more smaller role.<br />As all the money in the world will do.<br />The domination of gold as money will lose the battle against the bitcoin.<br />The advantages of the bitcoin is far to great over gold.<br /><br />Bubble?<br /><br />The bitcoin is here to stay.<br />Demand and supply is all there is, no bubble in sight.<br />The bitcoin has hardly begun.<br />Of the 21 million only 11 million btc&#039;s have been made and will become more difficult to make as the mined blocks are every 4 years rewarded with only half what the miners used to get.<br /><br />At the end of November last year you got 50 btc when 1 block was mined.<br />One month later you got only 25 btc for that same block.<br /><br />So if the demand is growing by the day and the makers all over the world are becoming only haf what they used to get, supply and demand will make the bitcoin twice the price it used to be and more.<br />It is a law. Supply and demand is a law.<br />If you reward the miners with half the money they used to get and the demand keeps on growing the price has to double.<br />And double it will each time the reward is cut in half and the demand stays the same or keeps on rising, the bitcoin will double its worth.<br /><br />But I dont know shit. Left school before I was fourteen and learned my English in 9 days and to listen to the radio and watch television.<br />I am just a un-educated average person with a opinion

Avalon was the first to the market because they rushed and sell in small batches. I give them props for being first, but they won&#039;t be the best (only) option forever.

				What caused the &#039;crash&#039; of last year? <br />Wasta is convincing me, but there are no guarantees. However, scarcity and demand (and the invisible hand of the market) can&#039;t be legistated (effectively) against, and it also seems to me (a magnitude less of education compared to wasta!) that the BTC has no where to go but up. <br />But I swore I&#039;d never buy into the stock market again. I never made money and lost a bunch in 2000 when the tech boom seemed to be going on forever. Everything was supposed to change then too, but the tech stocks still crashed. <br />But it seems the BTC has gone up about $15 overnight, for the last several weeks hasn&#039;t really retreated at all. <br />Exiting times!<br /><br />How many BTC do these established servers (the $1299 ones) hope to make-does it make sense to buy one? I need another computer anyway, my computer is 8-10 years old, but I only use it for internet, word processing etc. <br /><br />Maybe the vendors will fulfill my orders quicker, since they want to get them finalized!! I bought stuff a week ago.

				I see four threats to the long-term appreciation of Bitcoins vs [insert your favorite fiat currency here]:<br /><br />As goblin stated previously, only 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist.&nbsp; Right now we are just shy of 11 million, and the rate at which new coins are produced is slowing, so that we will reach 21 million in about 130 years.&nbsp; At that time, transaction fees for moving money become important or else all the people &quot;mining&quot; or verifying transactions (who currently receive bits of the uncirculated coins) will find something else to do with their computing power.&nbsp; That&#039;s the first threat to the Bitcoin currency.<br /><br />The second is that the government decides to justify shutting down BitInstant, ZipZap, Bitfloor transactions, etc. by saying that alternative currency somehow interferes with our economy.&nbsp; The real reason, of course, would be the &quot;war&quot; on drugs and fear of losing control.&nbsp; The currency would still exist, but the barrier to getting money in and out would be so high that its use would drop off dramatically.<br /><br />The third threat is that something happens to SR.&nbsp; In August of 2012,&nbsp; $87 million USD worth of Bitcoin was in circulation and a Carnegie Mellon study found that SR did revenue of about $2 million USD (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/study-estimates-2-million-a-month-in-bitcoin-drug-sales/).&nbsp; Considering the data that came from a study two months later that found that 78% of Bitcoins aren&#039;t being actively traded (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/78-percent-of-bitcoin-currency-stashed-under-digital-mattress-study-finds/), SR accounts for 10% of Bitcoin activity.&nbsp; I would suspect it might even be higher than that.&nbsp; Point is, SR is probably currently the single most influential factor to the value of Bitcoins.&nbsp; If SR continues to have something of a monopoly on this business, then one day the administrators go rogue, the BTC may suffer a hit it cannot recover from if vendors and customers don&#039;t find somewhere else to congregate quickly.&nbsp; If other sites pop up, the administrators keep making good decisions, and the site remains impossible to shut down, then the BTC retains its value.<br /><br />The last threat is the scariest and I believe the most likely.&nbsp; It is that the government starts to make examples out of the people who get caught buying.&nbsp; They ramp up inspections of packages; turn &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; (legal term in America that defines proof necessary to detain a person, seize a package, or get a warrant) into &quot;a thought,&quot; making it routine to falsify claims of odors or leaks in order to fight the &quot;war&quot;; and start tracking packages and addresses more carefully.&nbsp; The vendors who use the same return addresses (which will show up in their database as having shipped to hundreds of different locations) each time will eventually be found out watching the blue box that they drop packages into week after week, but worse, the customers, whose most intimate knowledge of their vendors is only what their packaging looks like and perhaps what zip code it was shipped from, will be caught with their pants down.&nbsp; They will have no leverage in making a deal and will be prosecuted (unlike those who buy off the street) to the fullest extent.&nbsp; Police chiefs across the nation will appear on local TV news speaking to college kids, warning them that they will be caught and will get fucked.&nbsp; It will simply scare people away from buying online and the Bitcoin, along with being irrelevant to all of us, will tank.<br /><br />I think we&#039;re fine though.&nbsp; We&#039;ll find a way, no matter what the adversary.&nbsp; And the Bitcoin will keep gaining value.... :)

				I have dreams that in 5 years time - BitCoin has become mainstream, and my few hundred coins are worth millions :)<br />Seriously though, unless LE works out a way of shutting down TOR or ALL of the governments of the world get together and ban cashing out Bitcoins (virtually impossible), limited availability and investment potential continues to gain traction, we will see BTC continue to rise 300%-500% annually.<br /><br />Now if we can get Bitcoins on the commodity market - The Sky&#039;s the limit. <br /><br />

				Amazing. Each day I keep thinking it must finally be the day the price stops climbing, but it keeps on creeping up.&nbsp; Invest more, and get more people to invest and the price just goes up...<br /><br />I keep reading real banks are forming relationships with bitcoin vendors and as the currency gains legitimacy, more people are purchasing and using them...

August 2012 data is quite old in this rapidly evolving economy. USD exchange volume has gone up 10 fold since then:<br /><br />https://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume<br /><br />and will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. Of course there&#039;s no way to be sure, but I doubt more than a small fraction of that is from an increased SR userbase. The number of legitimate uses of bitcoin is expanding and diversifying. The FinCEN report that came out a few days ago and affirmed the legality of bitcoin will give many large and mainstream businesses the confidence to integrate it as a payment option.<br /><br />Bitcoin isn&#039;t dependent on any single merchant anymore, if it ever was.<br /><br /><br />(It&#039;s also noteworthy that when SR suffered an extended downtime in November 2012 because of a huge increase in users, there&#039;s no noticeable blip in the exchange trade volume. There were bigger spikes in October.)

There are indirect ways to measure relative growth in SR&#039;s userbase.<br /><br />Look at some forum stats:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12-08&nbsp; &nbsp;13-02<br />New members&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4066&nbsp; &nbsp; 3831<br />New topics&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5417&nbsp; &nbsp; 10146<br />New posts&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;62348&nbsp; &nbsp;87007<br /></code><br />For whatever reason, there were anomalously high user registrations last August. In July and September there were 3428 and 3665. So ignoring that, there seems to be a 40-100% increase in forum activity based on topics and posts.<br /><br />I also remember about 5000 listings on the market back then and 8000 today.<br /><br />So we can estimate that SR&#039;s growth has been between 50-100% since August.<br /><br />Still, the exchange trade volume has increased 10 fold and most of that was in the last 2 months, which is why BTC price has skyrocketd. If SR accounted for 10% of exchange trade volume back then, then it might be 2% today.<br /><br />

				Good news! It&#039;s isn&#039;t, and won&#039;t ever be. <br /><br />Governments will exercise control at the margins, where bitcoins bump into fiat currency. Governments print fiat currency and will always control it, so buying bitcoins with fiat currency will be regulated.

				If you&#039;re interested in the rise or fall of bitcoin you need to research the Theory of Speculation. <br /><br />Prices in markets move randomly. This strikes people as peculiar, as *clearly* there must be patterns, there are booms and busts after all, don&#039;t prices follow a rational logic of their own? But actually it&#039;s basically correct, asset prices do move randomly because investors/speculators change the price to fit the real circumstances. The result is that only new information (the future) affects prices, which implies you need supernatural abilities to continually predict prices. Patterns do exist in the stock market and currency markets, but you cannot consistently make profits from them because of this. Even if you don&#039;t believe it, the market behaves as if it were true.<br /><br />The most practical advice I can give you on buying and selling bitcoin is two words: Limit Orders. <br /><br />Most people appear to be using market orders, which means they are saying they want X bitcoins at any price in USD, or any number of bitcoins for X quantity of USD, which is the same thing. This ensures you get your bitcoin ASAP. <br /><br />The majority of market participants are inexperienced. No experienced market participant uses market orders in a volatile market, let alone one as volatile as bitcoin. This contributes to the volatility, increasing the propensity of bubble or bust like behavior.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to be out of pocket then use limit orders.<br /><br />A limit order, unlike a market order, isn&#039;t necessarily always filled. If prices suddenly jump and stay high then you simply don&#039;t get any bitcoins.<br /><br />The result is that you can specify a price for which you will not buy. So potential losses are fixed to what you can bear, which seems logical in a volatile market. The same concept applies for selling.

				EarlyCuylerTOR, MtGox and Bitfloor have equally functional trading tools.&nbsp; It&#039;s simple market orders and limit orders.&nbsp; CampBX offers more control with stop-loss options, margin buying, short selling, and a few other features.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a 0.55% commission compared to MtGox&#039;s 0.6% base commission.<br /><br />ICBIT lets you invest in oil, gold, and the S&amp;P in addition to BTC/USD.&nbsp; It&#039;s fees vary.

				I&#039;ve got accounts with all of them... I like CampBX the most because its the most flexible and its US based.&nbsp; You know who has your money and you&#039;ve got (relatively) easy recourse in the case something goes wrong.&nbsp; Same deal with Bitfloor: US based.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t tie a bank account to anything that isn&#039;t US based.<br /><br />ICBIT, on the other hand, is almost a hidden service when it comes to accountability.&nbsp; No one really knows who operates the site.&nbsp; A WHOIS lookup, if I remember correctly, doesn&#039;t turn up anything.&nbsp; And, you&#039;re potentially exposed to fraudulent (or poor) counterparties who fill orders for you.&nbsp; That is, the site does not back any of their transactions or verify any parties for the sake of anonymity.&nbsp; This could result in losses, specifically lost profit.&nbsp; I would stay away from ICBIT, unless you really do you homework and like it a lot.&nbsp; (I didn&#039;t mention before but ICBIT has a 0.5% commission)<br /><br />Another service, BTC-e has 0.2% fees.&nbsp; It&#039;s based in Russia and has a good reputation, I&#039;d trust it just as much as Mt. Gox, the Japanese site that seems to be the gold standard when it comes to exchanging BTC/USD.<br /><br />So, your options vary depending on what kind of trading you want to do (day trading or long-term), but Bitcoins keep things very flexible and you can always send $100 to each of these services and see which ones you like the best.&nbsp; If you want to look at even more, somebody made a list of all of them: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Financial<br /><br />Always keep in mind that many of these services come and go (Google Tradehill), and diversifying or only going with one reputable US based service is vital for long-term security.

				3 Weeks ago in reply 30 I said that there was no bubble multiple times.<br />That 60 dollar was not a fair price, it should be closer near the 200 dollar<br /><br />The bitcoin was 30 dollar in 2011 all charts rise every year at least 500%<br /><br />Look at the transactions of 2012 and 2011, the amount of money, the number of wallets, the number of users of bitcoins.<br />All are indicators that the bitcoin had to rise al least ten times against the euro and dollar.<br /><br />All indicators pointed it out, this was no no bubble<br /><br />http://blockchain.info/nl/charts<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to Einstein to see that the bitcoin could go only one way...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ....UP ! ....

				I do think BTC is still way to volatile to be considered a good investment. What we see is the behavior of penny markets, other than SR there are very few legit places you can use BTC, I think a crash is imminent. And when it does come, no one will see it coming, SR will be hit hardest. Call me paranoid, but I think this hype might actually be a complex pump and dump scheme orchestrated by LE to destroy SR.

				Just stop and think about it for a second. SR is the only popular market place where payment is made ONLY in btc. Most other places use BTC as a secondary form of payment. The bitcoin economy is very very far from it&#039;s market cap. It&#039;s all about speculators. Think of the early adopters. A guy investing 1000 bucks in BTC in 2010 at $.10/BTC is now a milionaire. Don&#039;t you think he&#039;d be thinking of cashing out his 1.4 million bucks? The early adopters now have 1000s of coins sitting in their wallets, this is like a fucking lottery ticket for them.

I do think there will be some organic growth after the crash but it is going to be painful, especially for SR, as I&#039;m sure there are more than a few vendors holding onto their coins.

LE is well aware of SR and especially after the Gawker article they are surely spending nights investigating it. You may think SR is of little interest compared to the big drug cartels, but with SR it&#039;s different. The drug cartels operate under the radar, SR is a lot more blatant much more likely to cause public outrage.<br />Also think about the fact that BTC is not even remotely appealing to governments and LE as they don&#039;t have any control over it so it makes a lot of sense for LE to attack bitcoin (kill two rabbits in one shot). Don&#039;t think LE is surfing the forums all day trying to find personal info of users, they working really hard to shut down the whole operation and they might have gone for the bitcoins.

				Here&#039;s what bugs me: We have to take conversion at the current rate, but SR seems to follow the MTgox weighted average (currently 170 vs 195 per BTC)<br /><br />This means that to &quot;get&quot; our value, we have to wait for SR to catch up, risking losing the coins in the event of a crash. Even then, if a vendor sits on an order a few days before shipping, they have the opportunity to make far more money if they don&#039;t hedge the orders; an incentive to take longer to ship.

Deciding whether or not to buy more, going to do some more research into economic theory. The thing that concerns me is the national news coverage of the bitcoin and its meteoric rise....this always comes shortly before the fall.

				Calm down people. It&#039;s not losing steam. Up and down a few dollars does not mean shit against the trend. Every day it drops and rises throughout the day. Its back at 184. Will probably dip again, then rise, then dip. Stop staring at MTGOX. You will be richer tonight then you were yesterday night, and you will be richer in the morning then you&#039;re going to be tonight. And so on and so forth. It&#039;s going to keep going up towards infinity. I&#039;m gonna be a billionaire in one month. Just kidding.. But yeah, calm down. The &quot;correction&quot; isn&#039;t gonna happen for a while.

But when just ONE of the Big Money Shotcallers move in under investor pressure because of the media frenzy.. we&#039;re gonna remember 200 like it was peanuts. I&#039;m not fucking around.. 1k WILL happen within a few months. Yes, you read that right. Now go feed the beast and buy some more BTC fuckers! Woohoooo

				I&#039;m betting on it crashing at least once before the end of the year, by which I mean a drop of 50% or more of its value in less than 24 hours.<br /><br />It almost looks like it&#039;d recover immediately, though, because so many people (myself included) would be all over that in an instant.

				Why? If you believe it will continue going up, then now is the best time to buy. :)<br /><br />Think of it this way. You can buy at $225 right now. Your theory of a crash might come true, but it might happen when BTC is at $600 and it will drop to $300. That&#039;s a worse deal than if you bought now and there was no crash.<br />

				If there is a sudden crash (of say 50%) is it correct to say that the SR system will be slow to recognise it and so the price on SR won&#039;t reflect the true price for a few minutes, meaning one could cash out in the form of buying drugs without suffering from a financial hit?

I&#039;m sure some early adopters will dump their coins onto the market at some stage in the not too distant future, if you bought several thousand at a dollar each the temptation to cash out must be huge but even that will only result in a very short term fluctuation in value.<br /><br />I&#039;m with you on this one lorax, we will be looking at $300 before you know it.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been trying to buy and sell in the same market. Turn your cash into BTC and BTC into an SR order in the shortest space of time. That will limit your exposure to fluctuations. For those holding onto coins for goodness sake don&#039;t dump them on mass every time you shit yourself the bottom is going to drop out of the market. All that does is accelerate the fluctuations and encourage the big traders to screw with the volumes. Perhaps some of us are losing a bit here or gaining a bit there, but those guys rake it in when we panic.

				This is the main problem, of the many, of having one exchange handling 80% of the trading volume of the BTC market. <br /><br />Especially a website/dev team that was ill equipped to handle this kind of magnitude<br /><br />I would suspect there is going to be another panic sell once MtGox reopens - If you plan to scoop up these coins for the cheap (Which I plan on doing) wait until then.<br />

				If it&#039;s really events like Cypress that bring the value of the Bitcoin up and not SR then it should continue to rise - rise again - because the global financial situation doesn&#039;t have itself figured out yet.&nbsp; This may be where the Litecoin and other crytpocurrenices really come in too.&nbsp; If there are stories of the people in Cyprus buying at $200 and then losing half of it then Litecoin and other coins will look more attractive.&nbsp; The people that are looking to protect their money aren&#039;t necessarily looking to double their money; they just want to protect it.

In 12 hours, with the MtGox price stuck at $120, it will be close to $120. When trading resumes, who knows what will happen, but even if the BTC price plummets, the 24 hour average will drop much more slowly.<br /><br />See, everybody was complaining about how the SR price lagged behind the actual price when it was booming, but now you can understand the advantage of it. Even if BTC price will be $50 tomorrow, your coins will be worth over $100 on SR.<br />

				If vendors are cancelling orders then I think its very bad form and they should be named and shamed. They don&#039;t know when you topped up, it might have been at $200+ a btc. <br /><br />The massive gains that have happened of late has meant in some instances you could place an order, go to bed and wake up to find you can now buy twice as much for the same amount of coins but your order hasn&#039;t even been processed...Did the vendor adjust the order in relation to the fluctuation?

				Certainly will be interesting to see.<br /><br />You&#039;re all free to do as you wish, but I really think selling off in a panic is a bad idea. It just becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People are panicking because people are panicking because people are panicking...<br /><br />

				That&#039;s what I was wondering. MtGox is at $124, the other exchanges are at about $80. Will MtGox drop to $80, or will the other exchanges jump to $120, or will they all meet around $100? I suspect there will be some arbitrage. People have been buying at the functioning exchanges in order to sell on MtGox, so either dropping to $80 or meeting at $100 seem more likely to me.<br /><br />No matter what happens, that should be a temporary, initial pattern.<br />

				BTC aren&#039;t really a smart investment choice especially if you can&#039;t afford to lose what your investing. Really its just a false sense of value. Investing money in another form of money is never a great choice. Thats why people buy gold and real estate. I&#039;m not saying you can&#039;t make decent coin off sitting on BTC but its just not predictable and as we&#039;ve all seen in the past couple days it&#039;s certainly not stable. I went from having $2000 worth of BTC down to $500... Safe to say I will have to sit on them a little longer to make my money back.

				Beyond just investing, I&#039;m bummed I have &quot;less money&quot; to use on the SR than I did before. I truly enjoy spending BTC and getting them in circulation as a true form of currency. Especially when, let&#039;s face it, you&#039;re getting top quality drugs. :D

If you&#039;re a buyer, you should buy a week or two before you want to spend on drugs (if you did that during the recent climb, you&#039;d get twice as much drugs for your money). If you&#039;re a seller, you should wait one or two weeks before cashing out (if you did that during the recent climb, you&#039;d get twice as much money for your drugs).<br /><br />When bitcoins are going down, or they are unstable and unpredictable, you&#039;re better off getting rid them as soon as possible, so at least you get close to the value you paid for them.<br />

				well this is sweet. me and my buddy went in on some bitcoins today through bitfloor and spent ~$400. Between the time we deposited the money and the next time I tried to log onto bitfloor, the site was down. needless to say i was nervous i might lose my money but the site came back a couple hours later with the funds in my account so i bought my coins and sent them to my SR acct..

				What a difference a day makes! 2 days ago I had $2000 that was worth $6000, so I bought another $1100 at $211. I thought I was a genius!<br />Yesterday, when it was going down I tried to sell at about $180, but BitFloor wouldn&#039;t recognize me, they ignored. Last night it was back up to about $190, so I thought it would come back. Now I&#039;m seeing it in the 80&#039;s and when I finish the message it&#039;s back to $114. <br />This was classic market manipulation. They made some large sales, the BTC came down, then they hit MtGox with a massive DDOS, which paniced the market and totally screwed people investing in BTC (like me)<br />I feel pretty stupid right now, although as I finish the sentence it&#039;s back at #125. <br />If I had any money, I&#039;d think of buying some if it went back down to $80, but I&#039;m really not sure of SHIT right now. <br />I could kill some of these manipulators (if I thought I&#039;d get away with it, and I knew who it was)<br />Somebody made millions of dollars and they are certainly happy to screw me and others-guess we are just stupid compared to those people.

				mtgox is down again (probably due to the surge when they restarted trading), and bitcoincharts shows all exchanges dropping value. I feel like something happened over the past few days that we haven&#039;t seen all the details of... <br /><br />ddos group manipulating price for their own gain? They saw it hyper inflating and realized it was the perfect time to spook new investors? Plenty of theories being thrown around.<br /><br />To be honest, I&#039;m happy to see it go. I like playing with bitcoin fluctuation of +/- 10% over the course of a day or week, but seeing it go to 260 in more or less 1 sustained rush was a little unnerving. Felt like my skies were getting too crowded...<br /><br />After it recovers, this will have shaken out a lot of people who thought it was their chance to score big and just got into the game; I anticipate it settling to its &quot;true value&quot; that the silk road gives it,( by being the biggest actual use of it as a currency for trade)- somewhere between 30 and 80 dollars, where it&#039;ll stay for a few months, beginning a slow climb like we saw from October to January&nbsp; until the big money sees dollar signs in another catastrophic climb, and we repeat the cycle. <br /><br />We know some people made fucking bank in this circus, which means many more people lost money in it - those who bought during its incredible climb, and so the pool of willing investors to bitcoin needs to replenish both its number and their available funds

				Today was a big adjustment, still think they will recover, maybe not to the giddy heights of last week but the demand for bitcoins grows everyday as they are adopted as payment method for goods and services and given their limited supply the only way the price can go as time goes by is up. <br /><br />I wish I had cashed out at $230 but I didn&#039;t pay anyway near those prices for mine so not too upset, I feel sad for those who jumped in when it broke $200 though, I was guilty as the next man of thinking they would just keep on rising.<br /><br />Time will tell...

Simple&nbsp; :)<br />&nbsp; The products &#039;cost&#039; is then placed in escrow by the buyer, and the&nbsp; product is delivered by mail, with the funds being released from escrow upon receipt of the package and confirmation the &#039;goods&#039; are &#039;as expected&#039;&nbsp; ....... bottom line! Sweet ... (n.b. dont FE ;))<br /><br />Yes, unfortunately it doesn&#039;t always work perfectly, BUT, it works fucking well MOST of the time ... or it wouldn&#039;t still exist&nbsp; :o<br /><br />&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; &nbsp;IF Btc (or whatever currency being used to buy x) remains fairly stable, BOTH&nbsp; buyers and vendors benefit, as they ARE able to &#039;trade&#039; within the &#039;concept guidelines&#039; of a place like TSR)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;However,&nbsp; the current Btc fluctuations (for whatever reasons they&#039;re happening) are giving people with Btcs in their wallets, INSTANT benefits recently, which IMO has brought out the greed in a lot&nbsp; of us,&nbsp; and we are forgetting the MAIN REASON WE ARE HERE, is to get good drugs at a fair price, NOT MAKE $&#039;s WITH BTC&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />&nbsp;OR, for that matter, to try and make our favorite vendors miserable by TAKING ADVANTAGE of them NOT &#039;raising their prices according to the Btc to $ index...Oh No!&nbsp; But to say that if they &quot;stop trading/go on vacation&quot;&nbsp; rather than change all the listings, IS COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE <br /><br />IMO it&#039;s very sensible decision to take, in the middle of this current Btcmayhem!&nbsp; 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />&nbsp;We, their TRUSTED CUSTOMERS...SHOULD be very understanding of the mindfuck this MUST be causing MANY VENDORS!&nbsp; :(<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />So....what to DO?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Motek recommends sending your vendor a pm BEFORE MAKING ANY PURCHASE and &#039;check&#039; to see how they&#039;re doing, and what&#039;s the deal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***&nbsp; They dont WANT to lose business/customers on purpose&nbsp; :o , they&#039;re just trying to stay afloat (and dont think the HUGE vendors didn&#039;t cop a hard hit...they did!)&nbsp; ***<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget. Bitcoin IS MUCH BIGGER than just TSR! remember ...e-currency IS a major game changer ... the biggest thing since the Internet&nbsp; :o 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />BUT ...if we ALL stay cool, and treat each other with respect, and Not &quot;try and benefit&quot; from Btc&#039;s and &quot;make the most of&quot; the vendors who haven&#039;t changed their prices &gt;:(<br /><br />FFS ... IF this was RL and the dollars &quot;value&quot; had doubled in the last week, do you think the dude you call on the ph for drugs IS going to have the same prices as yesterday?&quot;<br /><br />BUT ... here we have these vendors, who are in a tight spot ... and as a member of The Road, You HAVE a Responsibility to be as fair and honest as you expect your vendors to Be&nbsp; 8)
