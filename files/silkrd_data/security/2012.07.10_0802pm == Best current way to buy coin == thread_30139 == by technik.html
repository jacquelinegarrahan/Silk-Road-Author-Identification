				I know this thread has probably been asked often. I&#039;ve used moneypak trades for bitcoin in the past but that has a price. Is there any way to anonymously buy coin that would be as quick as going to the store for a moneypak?

				well I ended up doing a moneygram through RXking. He was very informative and obviously wanted to inform me so I could be smarter about future SR dealings.

				Hi everyone. First post here. Since I discovered SR, I have been very excited. After perusing the site and forums for a few days, I am just about ready for my first purchase. But then I started looking into how exactly I pay, and OMG I&#039;m a bit overwhelmed by all the BitCoin/Wallets/Coinapult/Tormail/Bitinstant/mtGox/etc. talk. <br /><br />For example, I know we should always conduct all actions through the Tor browser, yet I&#039;ve read that we can&#039;t do that with MtGox. Sooo, does this mean there are other steps that also can&#039;t be done through Tor, such as using the &quot;wallets&quot; or Bitinstant. And, how do I know when to use my real email address? Never I would assume, so what do you all do? Is that where Tormail comes into play? What about mailinator.com?<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t sure what I thought the process of buying goods anonymously would entail, but I didn&#039;t realize that you pretty much have to go in person somewhere (bank/CVS/etc) and interact with humans! That ratchets up my discomfort factor by about 10x. I was hoping for an all online-digital process. But I guess that was naive of me. <br /><br />Anyway, it looks like my purchase is going to be indefinitely postponed, much to my dismay, until I can wrap my head around all the various permutations and steps of acquiring some BitCoins using the most commonly agreed upon as being &quot;the best&quot; services/brands, safely.<br /><br />Sorry for my first post being such a long rant. :&#039;(<br />

				^ I&#039;m right there with you MittDog. It&#039;s all so overwhelming. But, I think it&#039;s a better idea to wait a month or so to understand the whole process fully before you just jump in head first and possibly do something wrong or unsecured.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read the tutorials that I&#039;ve found, and have been going through all of the relevant seeming threads trying to put together the pieces of how to go about this. I also feel like a lot of the stuff people suggest is for larger orders because it&#039;s unlikely that you&#039;ll get busted for personal orders, but I still would feel more comfortable being as safe as possible.<br /><br />I feel like the only tutorials here are for people who already have a pretty solid knowledge of this whole process. Or maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;ve never made purchases like this over the internet. Seems like there are quite a few different options that different people think are the best method, too.

				Hey OtterBalls. Have you ever done so much reading and researching and a short amount of time, that when you take a break, you feel just as lost as when you begin, or perhaps more-so? Well, maybe that&#039;s just me. But it&#039;s funny, after only a day after that post I made, I suddenly realize I have grasped a lot more than I thought I did. A good nights sleep really helped. And as far as waiting a month, man, I don&#039;t think I have the patience discipline for that! lol. I&#039;ve already been waiting my whole life for a site like this, so I&#039;m going to cram as much info into my head as I can, and go for it.<br /><br />I found the extremely condensed explanation of the process on another post that helped give me clarity on the big picture. I copied the text, but don&#039;t remember the post, so credit to whomever wrote it. Here it is:<br /><br />1. Open tor<br />2. Go to bitinstant.com and setup a Bank Of America cash deposit.<br />3. Use a fake tormail throwaway account and bitinstant will email your coins cia a coinapult.<br /><br />The worst part is definitely having to walk into a bank and talk to someone. That&#039;s when I&#039;m going to feel the heat the most. Most people say they don&#039;t ask questions or require your name and info, but I&#039;m still afraid. And if they do ask, then it&#039;ll pretty much be game over for me because I&#039;ll have to give them my real info just in case they then ask for ID. I can&#039;t tell them I&#039;m John Doe and then hand them my ID.<br /><br />So, godspeed to the both of us!<br />

				Find BlueSkyTraders on silk road. They&#039;re currently selling BTC for 7.50 dollars/coin. Tell them the amount of $$$ you want to turn into coins, they will send you some bank account info. All you do is take that info with your cash to Bank of America, deposit it (no name required!!), get home and VOILA your coins are already in your SR wallet. No fucking with other ewallets like instawallet or blockchain and the deposit to your SR account should be there when you get home from the bank!!! Don&#039;t be nervous going into the bank, they don&#039;t ask questions about who/why you&#039;re depositing money. Hell, I have the people at BoA fill out the deposit slip for me! You don&#039;t have to do anything. They do not ask for ID, and even if they did, you could just say I wasn&#039;t aware that it requires ID, I got a ride here and don&#039;t have one on me.

				Thank you sl1pknot. I did consider buying bitcoin from someone on SR, like BlueSkyTraders, but kinda abandoned that idea because despite the good track record, I fear a ripoff, whether intentional, or if something happens by accident somehow and he doesn&#039;t receive my money. Plus, I looked at BST&#039;s page and the process wasn&#039;t very clear to me. I like excessive details involved. How is the money I deposit at the bank anonymously get safely in my SR wallet? Like &quot;751a696c24d97009&quot; asked, nice user name btw o_o, I also would like to know: Can you deposit the slip through a drive thru? And who exactly does that deposit go to? What&#039;s the name on the account? Not something too suspicious I hope.

				My apologies. I just realized after looking at BlueSkyTraders page, it is in fact well explained with helpful details. I must have confused his page with someone else&#039;s who I thought was not clear and lacking any details. But still, I fear being the one guy in the world who gets put on the spot and asked for my name, and I say John Doe, and then they want to see my ID, then I run out of the bank! lol <br /><br />So, at least if I go the BitInstant method and go into a BoA and have the same scenario where I have to give ID, I haven&#039;t yet committed to anything shady or illegal, whereas if I use my name and send to BlueSkyTraders, there is a direct connection between his account and me. If the shit hits the fan, I wouldn&#039;t be able to tell LE that &quot;hey I&#039;m only buying bitcoins for buying rare Barbie Dolls&quot;.<br /><br />Another thing I don&#039;t get. Why isn&#039;t it sufficient to do this: <br /><br />Say I go to the bank, or even use bank transfer online to get BitCoins, with my real name and everything. Then, I just start laundering, maybe once, twice or three times, like first I send the BitCoins to a BlockChain wallet using Tor browser, and after that, send those Bitcoins to a different Tormail account via Coinapult, and finally from Coinapult to SR wallet. Doesn&#039;t the first step of sending the bitcoins to a BlockChain wallet address I created while in Tor browser pretty much cover my tracks enough? I haven&#039;t seen any posts saying this is ok. I understand wanting to take every possible precaution imaginable, primarily by using cash. But once I transfer the BitCoins to a BlockChain wallet or another anon service, those coins are gone right? I wouldn&#039;t ever have to tell LE who I sent those coins to, and if I did I could just say &quot;I was going to buy a used wahwah pedal for my guitar from some guy, but darn it I lost his contact info&quot;. Am I right???<br /><br />TL;DR - Why isn&#039;t is ok to buy bitcoins while freely revealing my real name and info, then launder it a few times via BlockChain, Coinapult, etc.? BTW I&#039;m not talking about huge sums of money. Maybe $200 to $400 maximum.

And they didn&#039;t ask for ID, so it&#039;s all good. But I&#039;ll still be nervous every time I do it. Different tellers at different banks may ask.<br /><br />BTW, I was hoping someone would comment on my previous post.
