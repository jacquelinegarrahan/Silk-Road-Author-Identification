				Title: <strong>UK BTC through mt.gox - real or fake registration details?</strong><br />

				Can anyone advise me on whether I should be entering real or fake registration details on mt.gox with a view to buying bitcoins?<br /><br />I&#039;ve previously used Vlad1m1r for BTC purchases and like a number of others I&#039;m now having to look for alternatives. <br /><br />I&#039;ve read most of the other posts that I can find on buying bitcoins in the UK and have come to the conclusion that paying cash into an mt.gox account via the self service machines at Barclays then using bitcoin fog is probably my best option, but I&#039;ve read conflicting opinions on whether real or fake mt.gox details are the way to go. <br /><br />How likely is it that mt.gox will ask me to verify the details given by asking for I.D.or a utility bill to confirm the address?<br /><br />I also read that the option to pay into mt.gox via Barclays will be closed shortly - does anyone know whether this is the case?<br /><br />Any help, opinions or alternative suggestions would be much appreciated.<br /><br />

				depends on what you are going to be doing with the account.<br /><br />If you are going to use the account to only buy coins to spend on SR sign up with fake data. There is no point using real details and then making cash deposits to the automatic deposit machine, if you use real details you might as well do a bank transfer direct from your account. If you are just a casual buyer, i.e. buying for personal consumption and not buying too much then you could use real details and buy coins and send them to SR directly without too much concern. LE are not going to be tracking your coins from mt gox to SR and then intercepting your post to make an arrest. But for extra security use fake details and anon deposits.<br /><br />Mt gox will ask you to prove your ID if you want to withdraw large sums or if you access the service through Tor. Whatever you do do not access your mt gox account through Tor, that way lies trouble,<br /><br />I have heard mention of the removal of a cash deposit service but no evidence of it.

Why use Mt. Gox these days there are many alternatives, just as good or better than them.

				Thanks for the replies. <br /><br />UKMG - I see what you mean about using real details and that it would then be pointless using the automatic Barclays machines. <br /><br />I suppose what I should have said is that I want to use fake details but wasn&#039;t sure if this would cause problems in terms of account verification i.e. how common is it for mt.gox to ask for verficiation and under what circumstances does it tend to occur? is it just if you withdraw large sums or does it sometimes happen routinely?

				What did happen to Vlad1m1r? You sure he hasn&#039;t just gone into hiding temporarily? I literally ordered from him mid way through last week and everything turned out fine - got my coins no problems at all...
