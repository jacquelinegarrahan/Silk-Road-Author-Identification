				So, I&#039;m trying to add funds to my wallet via Bitinstant by way of local cash deposit...<br /><br />Routine procedure.<br /><br />Everything goes smoothly on the Bitinstant end... So, as I am transferred to ZipZap to create the payment slip, and after entering my zip code to find the deposit location, I notice that there are no MoneyGram options or locations available.<br /><br />Has something changed with the partnership of Bitinstant/ZipZap/MoneyGram?<br /><br />Anybody with similar experiences?<br /><br />

				I noticed the same thing today.&nbsp; No moneygram option at all.&nbsp; Zipzap is not an option for me personally (none within an hr drive.)&nbsp; does anyone have any alternatives?&nbsp; Ive used coinbase before, but would love something faster...

				I&#039;d say try it again in an hour or two.&nbsp; It happened to me the first time I bought coins a few months ago.&nbsp; A few days later I found out that it wouldn&#039;t show any locations until about 4pm for me, and I have no idea why.&nbsp; <br /><br />So is bitinstant up and working again like before?&nbsp; I need to find out how I can get coins quickly and easily again since the value drop.&nbsp; I was about to go try localbitcoins since everyone has been talking about BI not working and taking away anonymity.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been using it steadily since they revamped the site... I was unable to create a slip as a guest initially, so I decided to make an account. I used the name of an old boozer I used to know.. name/addy/other pertinent information came in handy when going thru the identification verification questionnaire.<br /><br />usually operates on point and without incident. Always receive my coins within an hour.

				I just made an account using my personal info on BI.&nbsp; It&#039;s scary how fast they can pull up info on myself and my family.&nbsp; Asking about ages, birth dates, and addresses.&nbsp; I wish I had another person&#039;s info to use, but I&#039;ve had no problems with using my real info in the past.

				After all, it IS legal to purchase bitcoins... Using proper tumbling methods and taking a serious approach to your measures of anonymity after the fact, is essential.

				Are there no Walmarts near you?&nbsp; As far as I know every Walmart has does MoneyGram in their Money Center.&nbsp; It closes early though, not open 24/7 like the rest of Walmart... found that one out the hard way.&nbsp; I think most (maybe all) CVS Pharmacys also do MoneyGram.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m fairly certain it doesn&#039;t really matter which location you actually select from the ZipZap page.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a convenience thing just to let you know where you can go.&nbsp; The account number and receive code on your receipt should work at any MoneyGram regardless of which one you select (not 100% sure on this but... maybe&nbsp; 90% sure lol)

				How are you guys doing it?<br /><br />I successfully created and verified a bitinstant account but I am still unable to start a new transaction.<br /><br />Each time I attempt I get this message: &quot;We apologize for the inconvenience, but we are unable to process your transaction at this time. Please contact support@bitinstant.com if you have questions.&quot;<br /><br />I wonder if it&#039;s because I created an account using TorBrowser? <br /><br />I know MT.Gox will axe you if they notice you using Tor...but what about bitinstant? <br /><br />UPDATE: looks like certain locations are in freeze mode because I was able to do a transaction with a different account I came up and verified...<br /><br />I was able to set up a walmart moneygram cash deposit using zipzap service so I am not sure if people above still have this problem because it just worked for me. Can&#039;t wait to order some drugs for the weekend.
