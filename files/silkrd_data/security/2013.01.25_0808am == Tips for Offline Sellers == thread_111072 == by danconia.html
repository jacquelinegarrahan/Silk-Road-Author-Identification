				I know I&#039;m not the only person on SR who re-sells to people in their local area.&nbsp; I feel pretty safe about online activity (BTC, SR, and even delivery) but sometimes feel like the weak link in my chain is when I sell to people in my area.&nbsp; For reference I live in the USA.<br /><br />After a few months of selling I think there are a few tips that I can give up front:<br /><br />1.) Try to have a stable job so that selling is only an &quot;on the side&quot; thing, so that you don&#039;t get desperate if something happens and you can&#039;t sell for a few months or more<br />2.) Try not to sell to people that you don&#039;t know well.&nbsp; If you sell to people that you don&#039;t know well, then perhaps it&#039;s best to not sell out of your residence or wherever you keep your stash.<br />3.) Consider using an extra &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; phone to do business and possibly a pseudonym for selling to people that you don&#039;t know that well.<br />4.) Obviously never volunteer any information to law enforcement.&nbsp; If they want info out of you, then don&#039;t ever do it without a lawyer (and try not to talk to LE at all).&nbsp; If they want to come into your place, tell them they need a warrant.<br /><br />I have a question and would like to here some of your guys&#039; tips:<br />1.) How hard is it typically for law enforcement to get a warrant to come into your residence?<br /><br />PS For those of you who don&#039;t sell offline, please don&#039;t come into this thread bashing us for what we do.&nbsp; Everyone has their different preferences and circumstances, and most offline sellers don&#039;t take the risks lightly.

				I would like to add that one should stay far away from the end user. Even if you are just dealing on the side, don&#039;t sell 1/8ths of pot, don&#039;t sell grams of blow et cetera. Sell in larger deals to your fellow dealers and let the extra wide margins go.. it will preserve you in the long run. And of course, always be discreet. <br />Good topic danconia<br />

				Nice topic,<br />firstly in order to get a warrant they need probable cause, Evidence or an emergency situation (eg screams from inside) <br />But if they have a friendly judge all they have to say is that they smelled Pot walking past your house and bam, warrant issued. they wouldn&#039;t even get fucked for this if you did bring it up and it was proved because in the long run, They found shit in your house so it was a good turnout. <br /><br />It really is that easy, There&#039;s also something else they do, and they&#039;l chap your door, Once it is opened the property is technically &quot;unsecured&quot; and they say, i heard something in the house and was refused entry which made me suspicious, (probable cause) , I smelled pot and asked to come in i was refused and the odour was strong. <br /><br />watch How to never get busted. it is fucking useless crap mostly, and the police know all that Bullshit, But there is one bit where he describes about these rap and taps or whatever the fuck they call them. And he shows you some of the busts he managed from doing them, Some 200Kg+. <br />Bottom line is, If they want in badly enough, They can get in legally, So if you dont want busted have nothing for them to find and make the bastards pay for you door that they kicked in, Do not say ANYTHING to them not even one word apart from, I want my lawyer.&nbsp; <br />coming from someone who has had to say that countless times, <br />Hope this helps.

				Also, it&#039;s been said on the forums here a lot.. but it&#039;s still true in rl. Never ever ever ever confess to anything... no mattter how red-handed they say they caught you.. I&#039;ve lost my share of compatriots due to panic in the face of police intimidation. Always make them put a case together.. because they often can&#039;t&nbsp; ::)<br />&nbsp;Also, don&#039;t live with your gear, change your patterns every few weeks, don&#039;t be shy when checking if a guy is a snitch, keep your phone number fresh and tightly regulated, and trust nobody. By nobody, I mean nobody.. other serious people will only respect your suspicion. If they don&#039;t then you don&#039;t want to be involved anyway.<br />Oh and above all, remember to have fun! ;D

				If you know anyone outside of your locale, say an old friend that moved cross country, try to reach out to them. I bought a vac seal and regularly send shit to a few friends that live a thousand miles away from me. Very hard for cops to reach out to you this way.<br /><br />&nbsp;I know how easy it is for cops to pull phone records and ping your phone to find your exact location. They get a lot of dirt on you from this type of shit. Any phone carrier has a specific phone department for cops to call and literally purchase your phone history. It&#039;s disgusting.&nbsp; What I do for my local shit is I bought a smartphone from Metro PCS. I made a fake facebook account and logged into it through my Metro phone. If people want to hit me up for shit, I just tell them to message my facebook account and do all my comms from there. No identity, no trace back to you. No phone number displayed on FB so the piggies can&#039;t track you with a phone. Most of my clientele also have smartphones so it&#039;s easy for them to hit me up away from their computers. <br /><br />I have bulk clientele. I order bulk. I don&#039;t sell little shit anymore. I have two handfuls of people who know I have bomb ass product and that I sell to. And I cycle through them. So client # 1,2,3,4,5 will get shit one month, and during that one month, client # 6,7,8,9,10 will be informed that I&#039;m taking a break from the game or that my dudes on vacation for a month or that I&#039;m not selling anymore. If I hit them up a month later saying I have a zip of moon rock for 1400, they&#039;re still gonna buy that shit despite the bullshit I told them.<br /><br />Don&#039;t keep shit at your house. Get a storage unit in a friend&#039;s name. Store shit there and grab it as needed. <br /><br />Make awesome fucking stashes for your car and otherwise. Personally, I wrap shit up into letters and make it look like I&#039;m going to the post office. Another one I like doing is hiding shit inside of chip bags, then resealing the chip bags with a vacuum sealer.<br /><br />I&#039;ll drop some more knowledge here later

				I mean a lot of selling drugs is common sense.<br /><br />1.)Cut down on your customers.&nbsp; Selling more for less is always better if it means you wont go to jail<br /><br />2.)Keep in good contact with people you sell too.&nbsp; The easiest way to tell if someone got caught and is in jail if they dont talk to you.<br /><br />3.)Never invest more than 50% of your drug money into any one thing<br /><br />4.)Cars are a terrible idea<br /><br />5.)Don&#039;t use guns.&nbsp; If you feel the need to use a gun you need to reconsider your clientele.&nbsp; Most people when they go down end up getting more time for their guns than their drugs.<br /><br />6.)I think the don&#039;t even talk to the police thing is a major misconception.&nbsp; I mean there are certain instances where it is best to just shutup but there is other times where cooperating and I mean talking to them a bit may save you some trouble.&nbsp; In the end though if you aren&#039;t smart and will fall for their ABC traps or are going to be nervous just shutup and know your rights.&nbsp; The only 2 phrases you need to know are I dont consent to searches and I want to see my lawyer.<br /><br />

				I read on a thread somewhere here that le will strip the buyer before they&#039;re about to set a dealer up giving them only the &quot;buy money&quot; in their possession and often times encouraging the buyer not to use any drugs and to make up some excuse as to why you can&#039;t smoke or use at the moment. Making it quick as possible as if you were in a rush or something.. I&#039;m not to sure on how accurate all this info really is but I would definitely think something&#039;s up if dude didn&#039;t have his wallet or phone on him at the time. Just something to look out for.

				If a custy ever asks, &quot;how much can you get?&quot; they intend to rob you. Treat this individual as a LE or worse.<br /><br />Don&#039;t tell the custys, even trusted ones, how much the product costs. They will hold it against you when hard up. (If they&#039;ve been profitable, help them out. They will remember... At least until the next time they can&#039;t afford the fix). <br /><br />Don&#039;t sell addictive shit if you can&#039;t handle calls at odd hours. Actually... Just don&#039;t sell addictive shit. Let the hood handle what it handles best.<br /><br />Don&#039;t carry a scale. A scale is an automatic felony with ANY amount of anything... That said, a good scale is an excellent investment. Keep it safe, keep it hidden.<br /><br />ALWAYS carry a deadly weapon. Preferably not a gun. The moment you&#039;re not packing, shit will hit the fan.<br /><br /><br />The best custys are the ones that will hang out with you for a while. Sell to your social circle and nobody else and you&#039;ve won the game.<br /><br />I suggest mentally tracking who is the most profitable customer, and do not hesitate to let the problematic customers ago. You are doing them a fucking SERVICE. Never forget that. Not only are you selling an illicit substance, you are selling a little bit of yourself.

Might as well put a sign on your auto saying &#039;im a drug dealer&#039;.<br /><br />In addition to your point, before anyone moves drugs in a vehical, do a basic walk around of the car. If its not capabable of passing inspection, dont use it! No broken tail lights, missing mirrors, spare tires, etc.&nbsp; Also, only drive with 1 person in the car. The more heads, the more likely someones doing something illegal in a&nbsp; pigs eyes.<br /><br />Give them no reason to pull you over.

I bought a vac seal and regularly send shit to a few friends that live a thousand miles away from me. Very hard for cops to reach out to you this way.<br /><br />&nbsp;I know how easy it is for cops to pull phone records and ping your phone to find your exact location. They get a lot of dirt on you from this type of shit. Any phone carrier has a specific phone department for cops to call and literally purchase your phone history. It&#039;s disgusting.&nbsp; What I do for my local shit is I bought a smartphone from Metro PCS. I made a fake facebook account and logged into it through my Metro phone. If people want to hit me up for shit, I just tell them to message my facebook account and do all my comms from there. No identity, no trace back to you. No phone number displayed on FB so the piggies can&#039;t track you with a phone. Most of my clientele also have smartphones so it&#039;s easy for them to hit me up away from their computers. <br /><br />I have bulk clientele. I order bulk. I don&#039;t sell little shit anymore. I have two handfuls of people who know I have bomb ass product and that I sell to. And I cycle through them. So client # 1,2,3,4,5 will get shit one month, and during that one month, client # 6,7,8,9,10 will be informed that I&#039;m taking a break from the game or that my dudes on vacation for a month or that I&#039;m not selling anymore. If I hit them up a month later saying I have a zip of moon rock for 1400, they&#039;re still gonna buy that shit despite the bullshit I told them.<br /><br />Don&#039;t keep shit at your house. Get a storage unit in a friend&#039;s name. Store shit there and grab it as needed. <br /><br />Make awesome fucking stashes for your car and otherwise. Personally, I wrap shit up into letters and make it look like I&#039;m going to the post office. Another one I like doing is hiding shit inside of chip bags, then resealing the chip bags with a vacuum sealer.<br /><br />I&#039;ll drop some more knowledge here later<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I really like your methods.

				My only advice would be to sell bulk, and only sell bulk to people who you know and trust. Because when you start selling to stupid/scared people, if the LE pressure them, they will snitch on you. Find yourself a base of loyal dealers who know the &#039;street code&#039; and wont rat on you if they get caught.

				Definitely keep it within a circle of friends to sell bulk to. Make sure those friends only have a number to your prepaid cell though. Even though you already know them, you cant really trust anyone. It would also be best if no one knew where you lived.&nbsp; Definitely do not become flashy, especially if you weren&#039;t always that way. Come off as harmless as possible to the everyday patron that doesn&#039;t know you.

				Start by selling really low to a few people, the fewer the better. They will come back for more. Slowly, at first, then quickly. <br /><br />The best way to do it is to reup once or twice a month, make 2-3 phone calls, and your done. <br /><br />Blend in, look plain. Polos and khakis, no jewelry or fancy rims (or anything you&#039;ve seen in a rap video). <br /><br />Keep it simple, and never break two laws at the same time (eg headlight out and drugs under seat). <br /><br />If you have to drive with drugs (try not to, seriously, it raises your risk like a million percent), do it sober, with the stash vac sealed and hidden somewhere that is a pain in the ass to get to (lots of those plastic panels pull out). <br /><br />Make sure the car is otherwise squeaky clean, inconspicuous (no sports cars)- the more common and boring, the better.<br /><br />Riding your bike is much more anonymous.

				It&#039;s possible to sell IRL anonymously if you use bitcoins. <br />The difference is that you don&#039;t use the internet to advertise yourself (like here on SR), and don&#039;t have to use the mail.<br /><br />Go to bars, partys and look for local dealers, find a way to contact them anonymously (ask for a phone number/e-mail while pretending to be a simple buyer, or find out where they live, or pay a bum to give them a package etc).&nbsp; The dealer gets a package with a sample along with your e-mail address. If you must use a phone change it frequently, or use smstoemail services so the dealer can use his phone to send you an SMS, but you get it as an email without having to have a phone. If the dealer is interested describe bitcoin and how it works. You can use dead drops, after the dealer pays you drop the package and let the dealer know where he can find it.<br />If you already know some local dealer and you consider him serious enough,&nbsp; you can give the first package for free. The dealer will be more willing to pay in advance for the next packages, and if he&#039;s indeed serious you can have an ongoing business for the price of that first package. At the end you can get out of the business with no loss if you simply don&#039;t deliver the last order before ending the business with him, but you can do the same after a couple of transactions. It shouldn&#039;t be a huge lost anyway you gain more with the business itself.<br /><br />Dealing with users works almost the same, find whoever is likely to buy your product, approach them anonymously,&nbsp; deliver by doing dead drops or mail. Leaving samples with your contact address around head shops, bars etc might also work but risky and it&#039;s quite a long shot.<br />It might be hard to find the first 5 buyers if you don&#039;t know anyone around, but after that they will either become a dealer and move your product or hand out your address for other users.<br />If you are really clueless look around on forums, music forums, club&#039;s websites etc, find eligible customers, approach them online etc. <br /><br />Using Tor, avoiding security cameras, leaving your phone at home when doing the drops, and sticking to BTC and it&#039;s almost as safe as dealing on SR.<br />If BTC is a problem find someone who&#039;s willing to accept payments and convert it to BTC but you can loose some of your money this way.<br />

				Former LEO here.&nbsp; Just wanted to add a couple of things.&nbsp; So many good points have already been made. <br /><br />1.&nbsp; Don&#039;t sell out of your house.&nbsp; In most states, that is a whole separate felony, and opens your whole home to search and seizure.&nbsp; If you own a gun, the gun becomes part of the drug felony.&nbsp; If you pay rent, the rent was paid to maintain a drug business.&nbsp; If you sell out of your home, eventually, the police will arrest one of your buyers, who will give you up to stay out of jail.&nbsp; They will give him money, he will go buy from you, and the SWAT team will follow him.&nbsp; Cops aren&#039;t smart, and narcs are even less so.&nbsp; The buy/bust routine is the only string on their banjo.&nbsp; But, keeping your home (any home, any building you maintain) out of the equation will insulate you from a host of felonies.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Driving with drugs has already been covered, but never, and this sounds obvious, but never consent to a search.&nbsp; In the quiet corner of your home you might say, &quot;I would *never* allow LE to search my car&quot;, but on the side of the road, I dunno what it is, but people do.&nbsp; If LE has to ask, it means they don&#039;t have legal cause.&nbsp; So, always say no, and stick to your guns.&nbsp; Be aware that they may come back with, &quot;okay, it&#039;ll just be a minute,&quot; while they&#039;re calling for a drug dog.&nbsp; At that point, let the money roll.&nbsp; Making you wait may not be legal, if the point is just to get the dog, and the dog might not be available.&nbsp; Depending on what you&#039;re carrying, a dog might be useless.&nbsp; Just do not freak out.&nbsp; Whatever happens, you&#039;re going to get through this, and if things go badly, your lawyer will challenge the wait, he&#039;ll challenge the dog, and he&#039;ll challenge the stop.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; Guns are a tricky issue.&nbsp; The Supreme Court ruled that where there are drugs, LE can assume there are also guns.&nbsp; That is problematic for a number of obvious reasons.&nbsp; A number of different opinions have been offered here, and you will have to decide for yourself what course to take.&nbsp; I would simply add this:&nbsp; Gunfighting is no simple thing.&nbsp; If you decide to carry a gun, I would encourage you to put the time and effort into knowing how to use it.&nbsp; The average gunfight last 2.5 seconds and expends 1.5 rounds, at an average distance of less than 3 feet.&nbsp; That&#039;s not a lot of time or space to put your life into, so you&#039;d better know what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost never a good idea to shoot at the cops.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ever shoot yourself, because it&#039;s never, ever that bad.&nbsp; Enough about guns.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Keep your stashes small.&nbsp; Or, at the very least, keep your large stashes of drugs and money hidden very well.&nbsp; The worst thing that can happen to you, from a legal standpoint, is for local authorities to give up your case to the feds.&nbsp; They will only do that if the feds care, and they will only do that if you are either well-connected or a big player.&nbsp; They will decide the former based on their intelligence or your rolodex, and they will decide the latter based on your stash.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be the guy with half a million dollars stuffed in his mattress.&nbsp; It will not go well for you.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be the guy with 20 kilos of white in what serves for the backseat of the Lamborghini parked in the garage.&nbsp; Those cases will go federal, and those defendants will go to prison.&nbsp; Hide your money, and drive a Nissan.<br /><br />Hope that adds and doesn&#039;t detract.

				Buy bulk, do not sell to kids at all, unless they know how to play the game. If mom or dad find the drugs ,maybe they will tell him not to do it anymore and will just throw them away, but worst case scenario they could force him to tell who did he adquire the drugs from, and then go to the authorities, i wouldnt risk it at all.<br />Try to meet the dealers that have brain, your objective is to sell to them and let them do the dirty work, you might not get as much money as by selling everything byyourself, but you will be making money and not doing much, just make sure your dealers know how to play and find like 5-7 of them and eventually you will just deal with them and you wont get your hands THAT dirty . Do not talk about the Road, the less they know you the best.<br />Always go to public places, such as shopping malls mcdonalds/subway/wendys etc, do not forget to dress nice, and you must not have a routine, always pick different spots, do not let anyone know that you live close by..<br /><br />just my 2 cents.<br />

				Definitely some good advice in the last few posts.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a question.&nbsp; If I am buying in bulk and selling decently large quantities to 5-7 re-sellers, I may want an excellent place to hide my stash between their visits.&nbsp; The best place I can think of is burying the larger stash and re-digging it up every so often to sell to these people.&nbsp; Is this an okay idea?&nbsp; If I don&#039;t have a good place to dig (like a lawn) then what about something like a medium-sized potted plant (with lots of dirt in the planter) in my back yard?<br /><br />Also when someone comes in your house looking for drugs, what are the changes that they bring a K9 to sniff the house?

				If they come with a warrant, the chances are excellent that they are not only coming with a dog, they are coming with more than one.&nbsp; Almost always, a search warrant for a home covers the curtilege, which is a term which includes the area around the home, so that would include your backyard.&nbsp; If it&#039;s weed that you&#039;re trying to hide, you are going to get a lot of advice on how to hide the scent, but it all comes down to the dog, and if all you have to work with is a planter, my money&#039;s on the dog.&nbsp; Vacuum-seal it, line it with dryer sheets, dip it in bleach.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a good dog with a good handler find shit that I&#039;m sure the owners put a lot of effort into hiding.&nbsp; Hiding weed from a dog is like playing slots in Vegas.&nbsp; You might win, but...<br /><br />I think the planter&#039;s a good idea vis a vis hiding the drug from your customers, but not from cops with a warrant.&nbsp; You could look at off-site storage.&nbsp; Not big-box places that require 3 forms of ID, etc., but searching the papers to find private property that someone is looking to rent NQA.&nbsp; Depending on the size of your area, that may be an option.&nbsp; The downside is that you&#039;d have to drive with the stash in the car, but the upside is that if one of your customers turned snitch and one of your buys became a buy-bust, you&#039;d only be charged for the amount you were selling to that customer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d like to revisit an earlier point I made:&nbsp; Don&#039;t sell out of your house.&nbsp; Figure out a dead drop scenario or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I have many, many friends that I can trust with lots of shit. These are my local customers that i resell purchases to. They know me well and I know them well. They wouldn&#039;t rat me out for at least half a mill (minimum). They know that if they were to fuck with me they would regret it immensely. Then theres the FOAF&#039;s who I make a shitload from because Ill sell 30% of a large order to a good friend of mine at a markup and them he marks it up for the same amount, which is a quick $200 profit each month just for counting or weighing some shit for 5mins while good music is playing in the background. <br /><br />As a vendor now, this is my first-line of tax evasion. I run a legal business but I dont charge taxes on SR sales nor claim income tax. What I do here is sell bitcoins (rather, I purchase items for people) for cash. This can clear about $300-500 a month so if I hit that ceiling I&#039;ll have some other shit to do. <br /><br />So since Im selling to people I trust and I know I&#039;m not taking risk, I call this &quot;transferring&quot;. I used to do this a lot in college and high school, where I&#039;d hook someone up with a dealer and take a nice cut. These days I just charge a convenience fee thats quite low to cover a few&nbsp; small costs. I don&#039;t ask for profit from friends, but they round up to the nearest $20, so I get a nice tip anyway.

				Oh!&nbsp; Well, that changes things immensely.&nbsp; Now, it&#039;s more like playing poker while sober with your drunk buddies.&nbsp; I&#039;m betting on YOU, now.&nbsp; Generally, drug dogs suck at finding MDMA, or X, or pills, or pretty much anything that isn&#039;t weed, cocaine, or heroine.&nbsp; Or dead.&nbsp; That&#039;s because local departments don&#039;t have the budget to specialize.&nbsp; I guess that might vary depending on your area, so don&#039;t be too complacent.&nbsp; So, if the DEA comes after you, you might be buggered, but I&#039;d say your planter idea should do the trick nicely.&nbsp; Just vacuum seal it, and call it good.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, don&#039;t sell out of your house.&nbsp; It&#039;s bad mojo.&nbsp; And, I know that guy said that his buds wouldn&#039;t turn on him for half a mil, but it&#039;s funny what people will do when they think they&#039;re looking at serious jail time.&nbsp; And, people think cops won&#039;t lie to them in the interrogation room, but that&#039;s not true at all.&nbsp; Cops can lie all they want; not a single rule or law against it, and it solves cases, so they do it all the time.&nbsp; That&#039;s why you never, ever, ever, ever talk to a cop in custody without a lawyer.&nbsp; And, if he&#039;s a good lawyer he&#039;ll tell you to shut the hell up. <br /><br />We should do, like, virtual fourth amendment classes here.&nbsp; :)

				Sleepyeyes, great info you shared there. I always like to hear how shit goes down, south of my border. Here in Canada most people who move enough to pull in $5K+ revenue a week carry guns. They&#039;re quite easy to get if you know the right people, but I get reminded every few months how most people don&#039;t really know how the drug trade operates in their area. Generally here in Canada all the large deals are pretty clean and seldom erupt into violence. A few biker gangs, predominantly HA traffic the vast majority of stuff other than weed, since weed production in Canada is more common than growing tomatoes, and the fine and penalty maximums for weed are low. Toronto is out biggest city, and yet remains safe (except for the occasional gang-related shooting, which makes headlines and shocks people simply because these poor black gangs here buy guns and they have such bad aim. People get shocked because the innocent are often the victims. Rule of thumb: if you visit TO and witness a gunfight, if you can spot the target either get akwardly close to him or stay 100ft away or u be hit by a stray.<br /><br />The thing about Canada that most Americans probably don&#039;t know is that Canada actually builds $1mil condos 2 minutes from what are our projects. The rich live close to the middle class and the poor. This works great in preventing violence, as you don&#039;t just have crackheads walking around an entire 5 blocks... You have grocery shoppers, students, commuters, crackheads, old people, all co-existing in the same neighbourhoods. Housing projects and zone setting based on income is disastrous for society and costs a lot of money to enforce because of the danger and prevalence of crime in those areas. Bringing this topic up reminds me of the failed Pruitt–Igoe architectural project that was planned with a strong focus on creating a community. It was a tragic failure, and now serves (hopefully recycled in other buildings, since it was basically just cement, clay and metal beams and rebar.), us as one of the greatest videos of mass urban demolition, which was orchestrated in a&nbsp; a tragic but beautiful kind of way.&nbsp; Watch it!<br /><br />To end my post with relevance to the topic, if the place your looking to sell illegal shit at looks like Pruitt–Igoe, then stay the fuck away, as I&#039;m sure you will meet your competition in such a large impoverished area.

				Ya in my personal opinion if I&#039;m having to carry a gun then I&#039;m in too deep.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a pretty night suburban area so it&#039;s not likely especially when it&#039;s just MDMA (cocaine, opiates,&nbsp; and meth might be a different question) but the chance of someone &quot;sticking me up&quot; is still there.&nbsp; If that were to happen I&#039;d just give them what they want (which would only be what I was willing to sell them at that transaction anyway) and let them be on their way.&nbsp; News travels fast and if someone did something like that then everyone in town would know.&nbsp; Still I&#039;m not about to lose my life or get the heat on me for a sale of 100 pills or something like that.

				Here&#039;s one thing some dudes and I were kicking around talking about how to profit IRL from SR - leave a small quantity of cards in a bathroom on the night of some big rave or party.&nbsp; We figured the odds of them being picked up by interested people would be very high relative to the odds some narc or club employee would pick them up first, even if they did, might not consider it enough to start an investigation depending on how bored/desperate the local cops are.&nbsp; After all the cops don&#039;t open prostitution investigations when someone writes for a good time call ###-#### on the bathroom wall.&nbsp; (or do they?&nbsp; that&#039;d be serious lol)

				Okay, for starters, watch the movie Scarface and Blow and learn everything they have to offer.<br /><br />Secondly, you will need the following before becoming a high-flying granny bashing drug dealer in the seedy underworld:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Gun<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; One or more Crack Whores<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Drug House<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Black SUV with huge ass chrome rims with tinted windows<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Jacket with a lot of pockets<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bling<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Subwoofers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Startup funds (or be willing to offer sexual favours)<br /><br />Now, you will need a reputation of being a hard man. So pick out the weakest person in your neighborhood and give them the beating of their lives. They will tell everybody and you will soon be on your way of having the reputation of being a hard man who takes no shit from nobody.<br /><br />After this people will not want to fuck with you. If you ever do come across somebody who wants to fuck with you, scream out at the top of your lungs and ask them if they know who they&#039;re fucking with. This will scare them and make you look crazy. Also, every now and again, try flaring your nostrils. It makes you look intimidating. <br /><br />Now, about the Black SUV with Big Rims<br /><br />People often say its best to be inconspicuous. This is absolute fucking garbage, you hearin&#039; me nigga? Police are smarter than ever now, and its likely that they will pass over the nice cars, because they assume that no drug dealer is dumb enough to have such a flashy ride. Nowadays, they&#039;ll just assume you&#039;re a rap star or some shit.<br /><br />Another benefit to the SUV is the windows are so high off the ground nobody can look in and see the drugs on your backseat. For people who are &#039;down&#039;, the nice ride will tell them you&#039;re a successful drug dealer. This is like free advertising for you! Finally, big SUVs look cool.<br /><br />Last, but not least, ONLY ever sell to children. Why? The police don&#039;t bother them. And even if they do, they can&#039;t get locked up and go to jail, so they have no reason to rat on you. Make sure the child is staunch though and agrees not to tell the police where they got their drugs if they get caught.<br /><br />OH! I nearly forgot. If you&#039;re EVER involved in a gun fight with one of your customers, just lay on the floor and pretend you&#039;re already dead. Children are naive and will probably believe this.<br /><br />Good luck and I expect to see you as a successful drug dealer after reading this guide.

It would be cool if I could shoot the occasional pm to you with an intelligent question for review..<br />As for stashing one&#039;s large stash, I like renting out storage lockers and things like that, burying isn&#039;t really my thing. Also, I prefer two large stashes over one super large stash. Backup your backups. Whatever you choose to hide your gear in make sure you change it up on a semi-regular basis.. patterns are to be avoided like the plague imo.

				Anybody who is stupid enough to come to Silk Road to try and learn how to deal in real life deserves nothing better than the above guide.<br /><br />Although just a few things I&#039;d like to point out:<br /><br />1.

If you ever do come across any issues, do not fucking talk to the police. Ever. It is impossible for it to help your cause, it can ONLY work against you. Your lawyer is the only person who can defend you.<br />3. For Christ sake, DO NOT FUCKING TELL PEOPLE YOU BUY SHIT OFF SILK ROAD! Not only are you admitting to a federal crime, but you also just gave your customers info on who your hook up is. People who do this deserve death for their stupidity.<br /><br />I have been dealing full time in the real world for a good 3 years now, and it feels like I have accumulated a lifetime of knowledge, and yet I still learn something new every day.

I have never been busted with anything and the only knock on the door I&#039;ve ever received has been recently from a seized package from Silk Road.

				Well, looks like this conversation degenerated quickly.&nbsp; If you guys want to relegate your argument to the PM system it would be appreciated.&nbsp; This thread was created with the intention of offline sellers sharing some of the more intricate experiences and wisdom that they have acquired over their time of selling.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to reduce the risk to SR users and when less people from SR get busted then it leaves the integrity of the community stronger.

As for jail time, if you get caught with a couple ounces you can expect to spend at least a year in jail, and if they can prove you have done a decent amount of trafficking you will spend a lot more time. I know a guy who did 18 months inside for 66 pills because he had a bunch of text messages and a tick-list on his phone that they were able to make a trafficking charge out of. The police also have a lot of power in Australia, if they search you illegally but still find drugs, you will still get charged in court.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=111072.msg886753#msg886753">Quote from: Sinner on March 06, 2013, 09:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That&#039;s a completely different scenario though danconia.

You do get protection when they like you, however one wrong move and all of a sudden you have to leave town. <br /><br />A guy I know was at a clubhouse and his girlfriend made the mistake of wearing one of their jumpers and leaving with it. When the club found out they came after him to kill him, but he got a heads-up from a friend and left the city that night for good. No ones heard from him since and one of the Bikies I know checks his house on a weekly basis in-case he comes back. They are fans of &#039;fining&#039; people who take a day or two extra to pay, and make a habit of robbing other dealers for no reason. Also, they are cop magnets with special task-forces dedicated to tracking them down, profiling them and putting them in jail which means that if you hang out with them you bring yourself police attention, and last-but-not-least they are engaged in violent feuds with rival gangs on a regular basis, and you can easily find yourself caught in the crossfire if they think you are the associate of a rival group.<br /><br />Because of these various reasons, I&#039;ve kept my association with outlaw motorcycle gangs to a minimum. I have a childhood friend who&#039;s been patched in, so I visit him when he goes to jail and send him money, and have dinner with his family occasionally when he&#039;s out, but apart from that I avoid business dealings with them and only approach them when a debt someone has with me goes extremely bad, which has not happened in quite a while. In this way I avoid ever being targeted by them, and avoid the police attention at the same time. Bikies when you meet them on a friendly level can be very nice and treat you with respect, but use a method of business very vulnerable to law enforcement efforts that relies heavily on violence, both implied and carried out, that&#039;s just not the way I operate.

Trusting people, secure dead drops, etc. It is why I gave up my investigation into carding as a viable method of making money and instead swapped to importing drugs ;)<br />It is a lot easier with drugs, as you do not have to worry as much about the package being tracked from its source, like they would if you ordered a package of amazon they actually know that the package is linked to illegal activity.

				I hope daconia does not mind but I have some related questions to offline selling. Mainly about security and the such.<br /><br />Basically i fucked up the first time around the block. I was young, wild, and overly inspired by the quick money Boston George made. I made a bunch of money very fast, and after several stupid decisions my house was raided. Nothing but an old roach under the couch was found. I pretty much got lucky and through my few months crime spree I only ended up with a small possession&nbsp; charge, and an intoxicated and disruptive charge.<br /><br />Here are the questions I have, and hopefully the answers can be turned into tips.<br /><br /><br />I had a tracfone. It was never bugged or anything. I changed the numbers on it several times. Had two different phones throughout my time selling. One mistake I made was not having two phones. I used the same one for business and friends. Now most people know I have quit selling and only friends text/call me. Is it okay for me to switch my number from my current phone to a new one and not have to worry about incriminating text messages? Basically the number will be the same, just a new phone.<br /><br />Also, if you do not sell out of your house and no drug activity goes on there is it still possible for them to search your house? I assume it is. By the way they fucking trash all of your shit and its hell cleaning up. Clothes everywhere, panels pried off the mini fridge, glass broke, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />And as a tip. When your selling large amounts to people you trust things are way less sketchy. I was only selling quarter lbs and half lbs. I didn&#039;t fuck up at all until greed pulled me into the coke game selling small sacks to kids I had never met. Moving a qp of coke in 2 days in my small town was a big deal and it caught a bunch of eyes. Other mistake was getting wild in the place of business. Cops came for a noise complaint, said they smelled pot, and asked to search. I denied and they didn&#039;t return for another 3 months. Second time showed up looking for a missing girl. Smelt pot, denied search, 2 hours later door rammed in. Luckily in the time it took them to get a warrant everything left the house.

				Division of Labour<br />Everyone has his own special skills,like hooking up with people,making them want to buy.Or the man with the greenthumb,or the raver who really is into partying and helping out other people.Watch people and evaluate their skills and loyality,start slow with them and see how it develops.<br />Always be fair to them,you expect them to be fair too.<br />And communication is important,state your opinion,so there are no missunderstandings AND only let them kow what they need to know.<br /><br /><br /><br />

DUMB MOVE BRO..<br /><br />to ur second question.. <br /><br />yes they can search ur house even if nothing is conducted in there.. BUT local cops cannot.. it would be DEA agents OR FEDS.. <br /><br />they are the only ones that cuz raid u even if u dont sell out of there or do anything out of there.. they can do this because once they have enough people telling on u <br />and sayin where u live.. they get a grand jury to indict your ass then ur free game for feds or DEA .. <br /><br />so pretty much.. stay small .. use 2 phones.. and DONT TXT.. <br />if you stay small selling maybe a pound or 2 every now and then .. feds wont even bother it will be a state crime.. <br /><br />anyways..
