				This is my first time.<br />But I went through the whole process in bitinstant. I chose what location I was going to pay cash to and when I clicked on produce ticket my computer froze. I had to reload and after I did it said that ticket was already produced. <br />I searched for the ticket with the email I used and it found the info but no link to click so I can print out.<br />I did this as a guest. Can I get print out still or do I produce another transaction and disregard my first attempt. If I do disregard will this affect me in any way?

				I had this happen to me a lot, but this was before their &quot;upgrade&quot;.&nbsp; ChemCat is right though, as long as you have the transaction number and all that jazz you&#039;re set.
