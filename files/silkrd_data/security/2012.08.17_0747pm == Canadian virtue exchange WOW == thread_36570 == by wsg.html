				This is a site that I had been directed to thru a faq on this site and I just went to go there and got this message<br /><br />To activate your browser, please click on the following link:<br /><br />https://www.cavirtex.com/activate?username=****&amp;request=**************<br /><br />Once activated, you may then log in and use the system.<br /><br />This just doesn&#039;t seem right. needless to say I be doing alot of homework before transfering any bitcoins from this vendor<br />

				Just want to report that I had my first transaction with Cavirtex today and it was flawless on all accounts. Don&#039;t worry about the browser activation, it&#039;s necessary if you&#039;re using tor.

ITS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD I KNOW ABOUT THAT DOES CASH VIA MAIL!!!!!!<br /><br />You should try to be safer dude... first you gave out your address to who knows who, then you came on here and told the world you cash out with BC and there is no way to say for sure that LE aren&#039;t checking the outgoing mail.<br /><br />stop being a naive 22 year old,&nbsp; man up and take charge!<br /><br />MAKE SHIT HAPPEN AND STOP RELYING ON OTHER PPL TO GET YOUR CASH!!!
