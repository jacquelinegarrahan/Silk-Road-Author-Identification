				I&#039;m sure the more knowledgeable people here are sick of answering questions like this...but even after reading through threads on here, I can&#039;t find definitive answers to these, so hoping someone will take the time to help.<br /><br />1)&nbsp; I&#039;ve been previously using the Dwolla -&gt; MtGox method.&nbsp; This may have been stupid, but when they instituted their policy of requiring a SS# to verify your account, I did provide it (and then transferred all the funds in my account to bitinstant, so I have no funds in Dwolla now).&nbsp; I figured I already had my legitimate bank account linked to Dwolla, so I wasn&#039;t anonymous in the first place, and I&#039;m not doing anything illegal through Dwolla, just buying coins.&nbsp; My question is if it&#039;s still safe to use Dwolla for occasional transactions - I&#039;m just buying small amounts of stuff, not selling anything or transferring funds back to my Dwolla account.&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; I&#039;ve read a lot about the option to use BoA or Chase with Bitinstant to obtain coins in a more anonymous fashion (and not have to deal with the 3-day wait it takes funds to reach Dwolla from a bank acct).&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda sketched out about the idea of actually doing that in person though...and wondering how exactly the process works.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a printer, so wouldn&#039;t be able to print the information out, what exactly do you need to bring to the bank with you (besides the cash), and what do you ask them to do?&nbsp; I think I understand the rest of the process, just not the part of actually going into the bank.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the run-down, seems pretty simple.&nbsp; Might give this a try next time I need coins...kinda seems best to avoid dwolla at this point, and waiting for the funds to transfer is a pain in the ass anyhow.<br />
