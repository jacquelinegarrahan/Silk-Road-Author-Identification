				Someone in another thread mentioned that privnote is an additional layer of trust with no purpose. I think this statement deserves a full thread. Privnote decreases your security versus sending your address in plaintext. The entire design is flawed from the bottom up. Now your sensitive information is on the privnote server. They can access it. You send the link to it on the SR server. Anyone who pwns the SR server can intercept the non-encrypted privnote url and do a MITM attack, being the first person to read the original message they can then make a new message that copies it and forward THAT url on. You have added absolutely no security and have reduced your security by sharing your address and order with privnote for fuck knows what reason, because they have a catchy name and people want to play spy with &quot;self destructing&quot; notes I guess.<br /><br />If you want to play spy you should use real tools like GPG that actually work for their intended purpose when used correctly. Failing that, you should just send your address in the clear because at least then only someone who pwns SR can intercept it, and SR is a hidden service drug forum running on an at least semi-secured server.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Oh and just so you know if privnote&nbsp; cooperates with the feds, it wont be illegal for them to view your allegedly self destructed communications with no warrant 180 days after you send them if they argue that they are essentially E-mails. E-mails require no warrant for interception if they are on a server for longer than 180 days, and there is no law saying an E-mail provider needs to delete E-mails entirely after you select to delete them.&nbsp; Another little &quot;a wiretap, but not a wiretap&quot; loophole in the USA law.<br /><br />

				I would rate its security somewhere between sending a plain text e-mail and sending a GPG encrypted e-mail, leaning heavily towards the plain text side! <br /><br />I have to confess though I do use Privnote to protect the mailing addresses I use for my customers to send cash in exchange for Bitcoins as many of them are new to cryptography and haven&#039;t yet mastered GPG - as such I do worry more about the information remaining on their hard drives if sent in an e-mail as opposed to being removed from the site after a certain amount of time.<br /><br />As you say this doesn&#039;t protect you from man in the middle attacks, even though Privnote do use SSL and also there&#039;s a risk that after the note is deleted it could still be recovered by Privnote themselves and handed to LEO.<br /><br />Of course you would still need the corresponding message containing the Privnote link to demonstrate context e.g that a person had uploaded their address specifically to receive illegal drugs, and not just to receive a CD but I agree it&#039;s something of a risk and could in itself prompt further investigation.<br /><br />In an ideal world, everyone would master GPG and we&#039;d have no need of such sites!<br /><br />V.<br />

				I think GPG should be mandatory for sending all addresses as a security measure for us all.&nbsp; I consider myself fairly computer savvy, and it took a bit for me to learn encryption through GPG.&nbsp; That being said I learned it and in hindsight, it really wasn&#039;t that hard.&nbsp; <br /><br />The way SR is setup, already weeds out those either too lazy or not intelligent enough to access the site.&nbsp; Learning how to encrypt is another security &quot;clearance&quot; to eliminate users that may be detrimental to our community.<br /><br />Hell, most of the better vendors require PGP already for sensitive shit.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t that hard, if somebody can&#039;t follow step by step instructions with screen shots, I don&#039;t think they&#039;re fit for SR.<br />

				I have seen a lot of vendors who don&#039;t set up PGP. There is literally no reason why someone can get shit to sell, buy packing materials, buy a vendor account and not use PGP. That is fucking absurd, and a vendor account should not even be able to be purchased if you don&#039;t include a key with it.<br /><br />It takes literally five to ten minutes or less to set this up.

So unless the private key generator was trash, privnote shouldnt be able to view the notes unless they can break AES.<br /><br />Browsing the source seems like it may do this, but i&#039;ve honestly not watched the traffic that goes back/forth or looked at the algorithm that closely.

				So just out of curiosity I had to test this... using a packet sniffer and Firefox I watched and observed traffic going anywhere during an encryption/decryption.<br /><br />Encrypt &quot;this is a test note&quot;<br /><br />Client encrypts the note, and sends the encrypted note to the server/<br />Client sends POST to privnote.com with &quot;body=U2FsdGVkX182xK%2BVqBr47divr9JukLU%2Fcn%2FE7wbZSX%2BD7SqYQ9m2D%2BBxZOfjxX8J%0A&amp;sender_email=&amp;reference=&quot;<br /><br />Server Responds With &quot;https://privnote.com/n/ejejizoiebcxdruh/&quot;<br />Client appends locally generated key and displays<br />&nbsp; &quot;https://privnote.com/n/ejejizoiebcxdruh/#dxxbyvvhxxhistjy&quot;<br /><br />Viewing https://privnote.com/n/ejejizoiebcxdruh/#dxxbyvvhxxhistjy<br /><br />Client sends a request to privnote.com at &quot;/n/ejejizoiebcxdruh/&quot;<br />Privnote sends back HTML that redirects to /n/destroyed/#dxxbyvvhxxhistjy<br /><br />Client sends request to privnote.com at &quot;/n/destroyed/&quot; with referer set to /n/ejejizoiebcxdruh/<br />Privnote sends back HTML with &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; id=&quot;noteinput&quot; value=&quot;U2FsdGVkX182xK+VqBr47divr9JukLU/cn/E7wbZSX+D7SqYQ9m2D+BxZOfjxX8J<br />&quot;/&gt;<br /><br />Client decrypts locally with the hashtag as the key, no further communication is done with the server.<br /><br />Google Analytics is used, but only the URL, the hash tag is not sent (the hashtag is the key).<br /><br />So it really comes down to the encryption algorithm which is here:<br /><br />https://github.com/mdp/gibberish-aes/blob/a693e7ebcfa10c8bb7973d90682fb2927ecc8302/src/gibberish-aes.js<br /><br />The weakest point is going to be the key, which is generated client side.. by..<br /><br />function random_string(C) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if (C === null) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C = 16<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; var B = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; var D = &quot;&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; for (var A = 0; A &lt; C; A++) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pos = Math.floor(Math.random() * B.length);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D += B.charAt(pos)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; return D<br />}<br /><br />I think it&#039;d be a pretty far leap to actually guess the client key due to even tiny amounts of latency that cannot be easily accounted for (what JS&#039;s random is seeded on)<br /><br />UPDATE: Thinking more about it, without the PRNG being a bit stronger, it is fairly weak. Although it is AES-256, they need to improve their key generation to use a real PRNG

				I wonder who even started the whole using privnote as an alternative to PGP. It&#039;s weird that site comes out of nowhere and states that it&#039;s a great way to send &quot;secret&quot; messages because they delete it right after it&#039;s read but no one can prove whether they keep logs or not for the feds to extract.

				Raven,<br /><br />One question to ease my mind:<br /><br />When you say you used a packet sniffer, do you mean a &quot;real&quot; packet sniffer like Wireshark or just Chrome/Firebug&#039;s XHR viewer?<br /><br />I ask because if the site was using flash to do the communication it does not want you to see, these requests would not show up in Chrome/Firebug.&nbsp; If you were using Wireshark or similar, you&#039;d still see them.

So private, you only need to reveal an IP address and the contents of your communications. How is that even award worthy? That is true for any conceivable messaging system. What else are they going to do, I guess they could make you register with a credit card or show photo ID. So private of them to not make you do that !!

				Unfortunately, and despite a lot of effort towards achieving it over several years actually, a secure forum system created by/for and funded by people from the drug scene is something that will probably never exist. Two people who were paid to program it fucked off and accomplished nothing. Additionally, despite a lot of effort towards design, it is pretty apparent that professional grade security designs must come from true professionals and not security hobbyists or illegal forum security Gurus (even the best ;) ) ...&nbsp; (not mentioning Guru, who may be a professional cryptographer for all I know). I am not convinced that anyone in the drug scene has the skills required to make such designs, myself included, and any attempts to do so may very well end up being counter productive and giving a false sense of security when in fact they could harm security.&nbsp; Furthermore, it is not at all smart to have security software made by illegal groups specifically for protecting illegal activity from law enforcement, merely using such software would cast strong suspicion on any users. Also, only criminals will audit it, and as I said before I am not convinced that the drug scene has the talent required to audit or create such a product in the first place, multiple attempts have failed and a lot of money and time has been wasted. Also, only criminals will use it and that is simply not secure, especially in contexts where security directly correlates with crowd sizes and diversity of crowd sizes. <br /><br />However I do have some good news. I have been closely following developments of a fairly similar in goal although substantially different in implementation and design and entirely unrelated in association project, and it is nearing completion of the first Beta. It will not be very well suited for a very large forum like SR, because the security comes with a large performance price and this in turn limits the amount of people who can receive a single outgoing message to approx one thousand. Unfortunately, the more messages a person sends through the system the less the security guarantees can be, so simply scaling the number of outgoing messages for every 1,000 members will not be the best idea and sending 20 copies of every message to support a 20,000 member forum will result in substantially worse security versus restricting your group sizes (really better thought of as &quot;message recipient size&quot; since the concept of a group is entirely defined by the sender of a message) to 1,000 members. <br /><br />I have been spending a *very* large amount of my time learning the language this is being written in so that I can audit the code, and I believe I have achieved proficiency enough to properly assess the correctness and security of the implementation of the algorithms used, as well as the over all design (which is in fact a composite of various algorithms from various academic papers written by true security experts) . I think the end result will at the very least be a much more secure and anonymous alternative to GPG, Tor (although it still uses Tor, it adds mixing on top of it) and E-mail / private messages, with a substantially lower learning curve required to make use of it as compared to GPG (more similar to sending a PM on a forum, or using a forum, with the crypto and anonymity stuff taken care of in the background outside of user awareness). it is also well suited for forumesque structured group communications, for groups consisting of one thousand members or less. It does technically support larger groupings, although it rapidly and linearly-per-extra-thousand-recipients becomes less suitable for secure/anonymous group communications after a message recipient size of 1,000 is reached. I expect a beta as well as the entire source code and some free to use servers running the server component will be publicly available within two months, the message forwarding, mixing, a provably secure cryptographic packet format, other base encryption systems and a lot of other required components are finished (I have gone over it and it looks fine to me, although earlier prototypes had&nbsp; poor code quality) and now the developers are working on message retrieval, which requires the implementation of a private information retrieval system. After that is accomplished the system will be ready for Beta, although of course it will be unwise to use it until it is audited by as many people as possible, I will give it my seal of approval though (of course pending my review of the rest of the code whenever they are done with it, and as long as my confidence in my proficiency in the language / auditing abilities remains stable for some period of time, I have surprised myself two or three times but generally I am fast learner and spend over a dozen hours every day focusing on learning this ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;) <br /><br />It is also nice to note that it uses established cryptographic libraries and only wraps them or composites them together into larger systems, implementation of crypto primitives is best left to very very very skilled people and of course only after an implementation has been publicly audited by many professionals can it be trusted.

				it&#039;s a shame that you&#039;re so pessimistic about this especially when i think that you&#039;re one of the people with the skillz to get it done but i must agree with you, it must be done by pros. after all the first thing they teach you in a security engineering class is to leave crypto to cryptographers, and the first thing they teach you in a crypto class is to not try this shit at home. :P<br /><br />i don&#039;t think scalability is a problem. the vast majority of customers on sr couldn&#039;t be fucked to run something like se, this would be more for private groups where there&#039;s like 50 people max. even the big places like cca or df wouldn&#039;t come close to creating a scalability issue.<br /><br />i knew the ruby people had fucked off but i didn&#039;t know they were being paid. that&#039;s a shame too. i&#039;m optimistic that with the combination of decentralization and online scene blowing up that there&#039;ll be security professionals getting involved in projects like this with the online drug trade in the forefront of their mind. (i guess that on the internet, nobody knows that you&#039;re a dog but security engineering is one thing where it&#039;s not *that* hard to figure out if somebody knows what they&#039;re talking if you yourself know what you&#039;re doing.) i mean, i&#039;m a really boring person online, and one of my irl drug friends is a cryptographer whose name ends in &quot;ph.d.&quot; i&#039;m sure there are more people like me or people like my friend lurking and ready to dive in, just waiting for somebody to rescue them from the public scene or a noob board.

The weakest link in any security system is the end-user. If you&#039;re dealing with unsophisticated end-users.... Like the old saying goes: &quot;Build an idiot-proof system, and nature will come up with a better idiot.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m old enough to remember the crypto wars of the 1990s. Then FBI-Director Louis Freeh was crying to all and sundry that the end of the world was nigh. Criminals would soon be using robust crypto, and without a backdoor law enforcement investigations would simply grind to a halt. <br /><br />The Cypherpunks, for their part, believed that the public would adopt crypto en-masse -- their unofficial (unspoken) motto was, &quot;Build it and they will come.&quot; <br /><br />Both of them were wrong, and for the very same reason -- both camps did not account for human nature, in particular, end-user sloth. In the case of the operators of The Farmers&#039; Market, I have read comments by people who knew them in real life, and they stated that they were told repeatedly what they were doing wasn&#039;t safe. Doing things properly would likely have taken them outside their comfort zone, and they preferred to stay with what they were comfortable with.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see the same thing on here, with people asking: &quot;Do I really have to learn to use GPG?&quot;<br /><br />The FBI found that criminals were not adopting strong crypto, for the most part, as it was hard to use. The Cypherpunks found that the general public were not embracing crypto for the same reason. Furthermore, in general, the public simply did not (and goes not) perceive a need for it. They simply rationalize that the state would never be interested in them or their activities. You&#039;ll even see such sentiments expressed here -- the government isn&#039;t interested in small time buyers/dealers.<br /><br />Frankly, very few people have the knowledge (nevermind the discipline) to use the tools appropriately. As you said, people just want to be able to click on a button, and not have to think about what they are doing.&nbsp; You make a system for these types of people, and you end up with something like Hushmail. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think the issue with a lot of the groups making security software is largely one of usability, as you allude to as well. For all of the great security technology they have made they completely neglect a shiny and simple user interface. They are so technically advanced that what they see as a very simple to use system is for others something that is immensely difficult to master, or even if it only requires an hour for the average user to learn to use they do not have an hour to spend on learning it. Instead of &#039;build it and they will come&#039; the cypherpunks motto should have been &#039;build it and then make an awesome intuitive GUI for it, and cleverly &#039;abstract&#039; away the low level details into simpler concepts, and they will come&#039;. For example, I think that the idea of calling public keys &#039;open locks&#039; and private keys &#039;keys&#039; would be far more beneficial to the average users ability to understand how public key crypto works, even though to someone even slightly versed in cryptography it sounds stupid. The major hurdle to getting people using security technology is to spend far more time and effort on user interfaces and simplified terminology than has been spent thus far. <br /><br />A system like Hushmail for idiot-proof encrypted E-mail can very well be secure, it just can not be entirely server side. If there is an application that simply allows a user to double click an icon, select a pseudonym to send a message to, type their message and hit send....the goal of Hushmail is accomplished without the major security flaws. The problem with Hushmail was not the simplicity of using the system, it was the inherently flawed design of the system. <br /><br />The best security applications are those that do not even appear to be security applications, but rather appear to be applications that the user would use for their non-security features. If you do not have a product that people want to use, it will not be used by anyone other than enthusiasts and smart people in certain situations who know that they need security to protect themselves. This is not to say that usability should come before security,&nbsp; but where it can be allowed for the most usable security systems should be implemented (IE: User selected delay on messages through a mix, rather than firing cycles of ten hours set by the mixes on the path), and a ton of time needs to be spent on user interfaces. Also a lot of thought needs to go into abstraction / simplification of any underlying security concepts that users are absolutely required to be exposed to, and as much as possible should happen in the background without the user being exposed to it at all.&nbsp;

				Seems like it wouldn&#039;t be that difficult to get GPG built into the SR PM system.&nbsp; Vendors enter their public key on a profile page, and then any messages to that vendor would automatically get encrypted before being saved to the SR db.&nbsp; Then it is up to the vendor to decrypt on their end.&nbsp; Even better, why not make this functionality available to buyers as well.<br /><br />I know some vendors complain about the hassle of decrypting messages, so ask that only sensitive stuff get encrypted.&nbsp; So maybe there could be a checkbox on the PM page like &quot;encrypt this message&quot;.

				I propose that anyone signing up for SR (vendor, buyer, anyone) has to go through a tutorial where they have to encrypt, decrypt messages to a fake bot of some sort - if they don&#039;t respond properly to an encrypted message (because they didn&#039;t properly decrypt it) then they won&#039;t get an account...<br /><br />At the very least, I have been pushing for a way to disseminate public keys easier - there should be a way for vendors to look up buyers&#039; public keys easily... As it is now, you have to have a conversation beforehand in order to ask for the public key... This is just retarded.&nbsp; <br /><br />Same for the forum - there should be a field in users&#039; profiles that includes their public key.&nbsp; I&#039;m even told that this functionality already exists in the SimpleMachinesForum backend.... Please just turn it on!

				Please all have a look at pidder.de !<br /><br />They seem to have created a really great implentation of an encrypted social network which is also non readable by the server side.<br /><br />Now integrate BTC and GPS dropshipping and we are ready to go..<br /><br />hopefully they will open source it sometimes soon ....this really seems very very promising.

				About clientside javascript encryption...<br />if feds bust SR server they can change the javascript code so it&#039;s as bad as sending plaintext over SR.<br /><br />PGP isn&#039;t that hard to learn with the tutorials on the forums, SR should put links to those threads on the signup page or send them to new people in a private message.

				Fuck Privnote, go to PGP Club instead.<br /><br />The way to make everybody use PGP, is if you change the buyer&#039;s frame of reference. Right now it&#039;s usually seen as major drag, a annoying thing that gets in the way of what you want. <br /><br />But, it is easy to make PGP cool! I mean, it&#039;s military grade encryption for fuck&#039;s sake, how many civilians get to play with military grade anything? There&#039;s the spooky mystique aspect to it. Look at how many people love the Mission Impossible movies, books about secret agents etc. Everyone!<br /><br />So... PGP is one of those things James Bond would have in his intellectual toolbox surely.<br /><br />I am convinced that the majority of people who don&#039;t use PGP can use PGP, but they are either ignorant of what it means, or they are procrastinating about learning it because it initially seems taxing. But deep down they all know they should learn PGP and become better people as a result etc.<br /><br />It&#039;s not enough to have walk-throughs, you need marketing spin, jazz, drama, all that stuff. And peer pressure from your cool SR friends who can&#039;t believe you&#039;re stuck in the 90s with freaking plaintext... You&#039;ll see more PGP Club propaganda in future.<br /><br />PGP Club is relatively successful. With the help of Guru, Louis and a few others we&#039;re well on track to teaching the PGP handshake to 100 SR users, about 3/4 of the way there now, only counting those who contacted me directly. If those 100 SR users show just 1 other fellow the operation, then that&#039;s 200. In this way you can slowly and organically grow awareness over time in a community. It&#039;s not like slotting coins to receive soda, there is no instantaneous change, learning is more like gardening, sometimes a thaw kills your stuff, other times there&#039;s a leap forward in growth everywhere. There&#039;s no other way to achieve it, this is how learning with groups works. Eventually we&#039;ll reach a tipping point, where 51% or so of SR are PGP fluent, and then it&#039;ll simply become a defacto standard and our work will be done forever, it&#039;ll unfold without prompting.<br /><br />I somewhat fantastically compared this PGP-less situation to how in the Battle of Stalingrad relatively few soldiers were given a rifle, while the others were simply given 1 ammunition clip or nothing at all in the charge against the enemy. However, it&#039;s not quite as fantastic a metaphor as it sounds at first. People with PGP fluency are like that solider with the rifle, if it doesn&#039;t get passed on, then is not entire enterprise is called into question in the long run? Network resiliency is determined by soft things, like knowing PGP, so I encourage other PGP geeks to leap from the laurels and spring into coming up with creative ways of pushing newbs into PGP threads and such. In particular, at source, where a buyer or vendor is using plaintext.<br /><br />For the Greater Good comrade! An army moves as fast as its slowest solider.

They will, if they haven&#039;t already, perform a bait and switch on the script. It is possible to use Javascript to deanonymize people on the Tor network. For example, and this is a really really crude example, it is possible to instantly crash the TBB firefox browser using Javascript. Then you most likely would likely restart Tor to get the TBB up and running again. If you do that enough times, then you can be deanonymized by an enemy watching for connections to the Tor network and using the timing information. It&#039;s just the fundamental principal of counting at work.<br /><br />And that&#039;s probably not the attack vector, but there are more intelligent ways of using a script to achieve the same goal.<br /><br />Stop recommending that *anybody* uses privnote. I&#039;d rather, like kmfkewn, that newbies used plaintext messages to SR rather than using privnote (and that&#039;s not a sound recommendation either, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s better than your idea).<br /><br />Again, you&#039;re heading to the PGP Wall of Shame right now. But Pine will forgive you and all your sins if you repent :)

				I&#039;m not an advocate of Privnote, and I&#039;m not American. Can we drop the assumptions? <br /><br />I agree with you that law enforcement priorities etc aren&#039;t the same in every location. But it&#039;s about resources. It&#039;s not an efficient use of resources to use high tech computer hacking techniques to bust someone over personal quantities because the punishments are relatively minor. In places where laws ARE harsh enough to make it worthwhile, generally speaking those countries are less developed and therefore lack the technical knowledge or ability and probably have a corrupt legal system and wouldn&#039;t need the extra proof anyway (Singapore would be the big exception, I&#039;d definitely use every form of security available if I was crazy enough to order anything in the first place).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And who determines when it is necessary?&nbsp; You?&nbsp; If that were the case all domestic purchases below a given threshold would be handled in plain text, regardless of jurisdiction.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t decide, the people decide.

Everyone who was part of private forums called it out as a federal honey pot from the day it opened, because nobody knew the group of people who ran it and their cover story was that they came from a mixed martial arts forum that had a drug section and just so happened to decide to branch out into the dedicated drug forum scene out of the blue. They encouraged people to not use Tor, and said it was for scammers to hide themselves. Then they blocked Tor because they claimed it was being used to DDOS the server. For the forums entire lifespan it was called a federal forum. We called them Drug Zone Feds, instead of Drug Zone Forum. Their admins name was LEOnidas.<br /><br />The girl who got busted used no security at all. She gave customers her phone number. She got payment to a donation site for some relative of hers with a medical disorder, when she wasn&#039;t taking cash in the mail or western union. She was probably the least secure person to ever sell drugs online. If the DZF sting is the best the cock suckers at the FBI have, then I seriously feel a mixture of relief in knowing that they are never going to be able to bust me and a strange sense of fear in thinking of how easy it must be for seriously bad people to run circles around them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OMG I cannot stop laughing :D

Reading the cypherpunks mailing list back in the day, many of them were absolutely convinced that crypto-anarchy was not only inevitable, but that it was even imminent! <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, I am not saying it&#039;s happening tomorrow in my comment, only that I do think it is inevitable. You have lost a little faith Guru, you need a little fire in your blood, you need to be hooked into a marvelous coca, a good fireplace and a comfortable chair like pine frequently is (:<br /><br />This is not exactly religion, but sometimes there are big questions that cannot be definitively answered by analysis because they are too huge to calculate. But, we must still make decisions in this complex world, so sometimes we need a little faith, some intuitions to guide our path. Science is a very slow process after all. Motivation is important too.<br /><br />The Truth is that Revolutions are not really Revolutions. They are the summation of perfectly logical incremental evolutionary steps which take the public by surprise. Take the most famous revolution, the French one. The thing about it is that there was no 1 revolution, there were many attempts at revolutions. Most were failures, and one of them changed the world permanently. Emily Dickinson has a nice quote from a poem about something else entirely that I think applies to revolutions: &#039;and then sense broke through&#039;. That is how I see this subject. The solutions hammer away at our brains, and we see the shape of them generally, but eventually they break through. Efficiency is a natural law when both motivation and competition are there.<br /><br />Why did it take until now for these separate technologies to exist?<br /><br />Onion routing has existed in concept form at least for a long time. So has public key cryptography. So have ideas like Digicash and Bitcoin. In fact, I&#039;d say all these ideas existed in 1980 or before. 30 years have pasted.<br /><br />Why then, does the Silk Road exist today and not 4 or 5 years ago? The answer is simply that the black marketeers like myself were ignorant of them until recently. Sometimes it takes a while for things to crystallize, and then once they do they are off to the races. After all, the number of people knowledgeable of both high technology and the black market are relatively rare mammals. The Silk Road has changed that, now thousands of geeks see the money making potential here.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24799.msg387322#msg387322">Quote from: Guru on August 04, 2012, 07:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Needless to say, it didn&#039;t pan-out. David Chaum had some brilliant ideas for truly anonymous digital cash, even having it issued from a bank in the U.S. -- the Mark Twain Bank. Needless to say, governments today are even _less_ enamored with the idea, if anything, than they were then. Back in the day, the authorities were only concerned with drugs/money laundering. Now, of course, terrorism and its&#039; funding have been thrown into the mix, meaning that there is going to be even more official (not to mention unofficial) resistance than we have ever seen previously. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, with all due respect, that is hardly surprising. You were fundamentally dependent on getting permission from the State to carry out your objectives. DigiCash, good idea, yes. But reliant on the government&#039;s tacit approval and the existing financial services industry (credit card companies in particular) with which it was actually competing! wat!<br /><br />This is not a problem anymore. Bitcoins themselves will probably eventually become declared illegal or counterfeit by some dumbass bureaucrat in the United States, and then we&#039;ll get going proper without the clearnet exchanges.<br /><br />BitTorrent has shown the way that it is possible to adopt a technology that is almost impossible to eradicate. The approach of DigiCash was closer to Napster than P2P in the way it relied on existing infrastructure and support from existing entities like Visa and the Mark Twain Bank. B$ relies on you having a computer and an internet connection, period.<br /><br />The same thing with E-Gold. The guy who did it was great, had a brain and his heart in the right place. But he was also relying on the approval of the State for it to work. It didn&#039;t approve. And they tried to bang him up without any evidence.<br /><br />Side Note: I believe David Chaum is the most likely candidate for being Satoshi, not sure why nobody else has mentioned this, it seems obvious. It pretty much all fits together like a hand to a glove.<br /><br />In short. Don&#039;t rely on the enemy when you&#039;re working against his interests. That does not make any sense. Break the law instead. There&#039;s a lot geeks can and should learn from black market operatives, since we essentially are both of the same hacker ethos.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24799.msg387322#msg387322">Quote from: Guru on August 04, 2012, 07:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24799.msg387183#msg387183">Quote from: pine on August 04, 2012, 05:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The rules of the game have completely changed suddenly, it&#039;s just going to take the scene and LE a while to realize the full implications of an independent financial network, strong cryptography and real anonymity.

Strong cryptography is nothing new, relatively speaking. It was available two decades ago, in the form of PGP, cypherpunk and mixmaster remailers, to name a few of the tools developed then. There was even a form of anonymous digital cash by the name of &quot;magic money&quot;. <br /><br />See: http://koeln.ccc.de/archiv/cyphernomicon/chapter12/12.12.html<br /><br />Bitcoins are, in a sense, almost the opposite of magic money, in that they were NEVER designed to be anonymous, unlike Chaumian digital cash. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with you on the facts completely! I just draw different conclusions because I am pine and a little mad. I also think you are underestimating two things.<br /><br />1. The *actual*, *practical* existence of easily applied tools to use those technologies we are talking about. Onion routing may have existed for a long time, but in whitepapers and elite comp sci circles on usenet or mailing lists. Only since the Tor Project has onion routing become available for the masses. The same thing with Bitcoin software. PGP has been around for a long time and has had tools for it for a long time, but it&#039;s only in the last 12 months that the online black market has begun to seriously start using it like Shannon has said before.<br /><br />It would have been practically impossible to obtain publicly and popularly available useable software to complete pine&#039;s &#039;holy trinity&#039; ten years ago, even five years ago. The cypherpunks were merely a decade or three ahead of their time, that is all. What is easy for them, was extremely difficult for everybody else.<br /><br />2. The black market. You didn&#039;t have the (awesome) likes of pine, shannon, kmfkewn, dpr &amp; co&nbsp; :) <br /><br />See. all the points about &#039;tools&#039; above are irrelevant without motivation. We got oodles of motivation. You need that kind of energy! <br /><br />Have you any idea of how much money I can make off this place? Even bringing my most trivially simple black market business plans to market here gives me a yield of 100 - 1,000 percent returns on investment. The arbitrage possibilities are absolutely fucking intense, there&#039;s no other way of putting it. It all practically runs itself, it&#039;s great. I mean, I&#039;d tell you more details but I don&#039;t want people working out how I operate and cutting into my margins lol.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24799.msg387322#msg387322">Quote from: Guru on August 04, 2012, 07:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24799.msg387183#msg387183">Quote from: pine on August 04, 2012, 05:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">This is the industrial revolution of the black market.

Rather than a statement of fact, I believe this is to be a statement of what you would _wish_ to be fact. <br />To quote Yogi Berra: &quot;It&#039;s deja vu all over again.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;ll freely admit that things are different now than they were 20 years ago. Computers, networks, bandwidth are all better than they were then. I will also grant you that there is much less trust in the &#039;traditional&#039; economic system, since the banksters crashed the economy in 2008. <br /><br />Once again, this is nothing new. However, all of these are _not_ enough to bring about the changes that you envisage. In order for an alternative financial structure to be adopted, the older, more established system must be perceived -- by a clear majority of the public -- to be broken enough, corrupt enough, and painful enough to retain, so as to allow for the adoption of a new system. Correspondingly, the advantages of any new system must not only be clearly obvious to the public, but be overwhelming enough to spur its widespread adoption, even in the absence of government opposition. <br /><br />One of my elderly relatives lived through the crash of &#039;29, and the Great Depression that followed. She had NO use for the banks -- the worst word in her mouth was too good for the &#039;damn bankers&#039;. After she died, we found money squirreled-away everywhere in her house. The difference between then and now, is that in her day, it was possible to deal almost primarily in cash. <br /><br />What I believe is most important factor governing the adoption of any new socio-economic system, however, is human nature -- that has most certainly NOT changed. I believe we have become blinded by the speed of technological change and, as a result, have forgotten that people (and societies) change far, far more slowly. I will grant that the rate at which change appears to be taking place is accelerating, no doubt due to the velocity at which information travels today, but substantive changes are still going to take years, even decades. <br /><br />I don&#039;t believe I am going to live long enough to see such a transformation as you envisage; depending on your age, you may not, either. <br /><br />What is important to remember, is that money is, when you boil it down, essentially a social convention. Anything can be money. When the French originally populated what is now Eastern Canada in the 1600s, at one point there was a currency shortage. As a stop-gap measure, playing cards signed by the Governor, became the accepted currency. <br /><br />Beads were considered valuable by the Indians; to the Europeans, beads were of little value, as they could be cheaply manufactured. To the Indians, however, they were a treasure as beads were made by hand, and required an enormous amount of labour to produce. The Europeans traded what they perceived as having little value, beads, to the Indians for what the Indians considered valuable -- beads. Furs were plentiful, and the Indians were quite happy to hand over the plentiful furs for the beads. <br /><br />One only has to look back at history, and look at the resistance of the population to the adoption of paper money. For thousands of years, people had used coinage, usually made out of some proportion or other of precious metals. Paper money took a few generations to become established. Even as late as the mid-1940s, there were populations that were still leery of paper currency. <br /><br />Fast-forward to today, where credit cards and electronic transactions are commonplace. I&#039;m old enough to remember when they weren&#039;t, when all transactions were done on paper. I remember the first banking machines, and the first credit cards. <br /><br />The first credit cards were not issued by banks, but by department stores. They were little metal plates, not plastic, and they were called, at least in this country, &quot;Charge-a-plates&quot;.&nbsp; In my parents&#039; day, there was little or no credit -- any credit that you might have had, was with individual merchants. The idea that one could have a plastic card that could allow one to walk into virtually any store and walk out with merchandise without having to lay down any coin or bills was quite literally the stuff of fancy. <br /><br />It took several decades for credit cards to become entrenched, I would be extremely surprised if Bitcoins did not take a similar amount of time to become generally-accepted, if ever. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>[/quote]<br /><br />What you say is very interesting, and a great history lesson thank-you. I wouldn&#039;t think the &quot;recession&quot; is over yet. Far from it, I think it&#039;s going to get much worse before it gets better. You&#039;ll get your disenfranchised civilians alright. I think London and New York will be on fire in the next five years, riots up the wazoo. I mean how unlikely is a mass bank run today? Not that unlikely. People are shifting capital ASAP in the Eurozone right now I can tell you that for nothing, particularly in Greece, and the banking sector there is essentially doing a case of STFU everybody in case the entire market panics.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think Bitcoin is the solution by the way, it&#039;s just the first one for us, we&#039;ll leapfrog onto something else ASAP when something better comes along with internal blind signature mixes etc. That would also greatly enhance anonymity and security for mass adoption. Bitcoin is the Netscape Browser of anonymous digital cash. It&#039;s crap at what it does. But it&#039;s the first one, so let&#039;s hold the horses.<br /><br />I do think that network level changes will occur far faster in future than you envisage, essentially because &quot;The Internet&quot;.<br /><br />Anyway, enough talk. Let&#039;s simply wait and watch it unfold. I&#039;ll be busy turning the wheels of my various projects in the meantime. You could be right, or I could be right, there is no way to prove it in either case.<br /><br /><br />

Wikipedia also says Tor is an implementation of onion routing. So one of us is just wrong. True you can use Bitcoin without a computer in theory, but I doubt we&#039;ll be mining bitcoins with our brains any time soon. srslyyouguise.jpg<br /><br />As for your last point, well, that was in the private scene so it doesn&#039;t really count.<br /><br />And anyway, none of this is really relevant. It is still the case that you need an independent financial network to catalyze all of the rest i.e. good anonymity/strong crypto into a force to be reckoned with. It&#039;s like a stool, you take away a leg and it doesn&#039;t operate as a stool.<br /><br />In summation as my counter argument: :P :P :P
