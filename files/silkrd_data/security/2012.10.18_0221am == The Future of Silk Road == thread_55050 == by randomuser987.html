				Hello everybody!<br /><br />I&#039;m new here and I have question. To be honest, I didn&#039;t really search through all the threads, but I searched a little and couldn&#039;t find what I wanted, so I thought I start my own topic.<br /><br />My question is in general what future Silk Road has. I have to say that I&#039;m not too much of an computer expert, that&#039;s why I don&#039;t know how save this whole onion-net really is (from outside attacks).<br />Is it in any way possible to take SR down? And if so, will it return?<br /><br />I&#039;m asking this because I&#039;m a seller for some weeks now, but because of personal issues I probably won&#039;t be able to vend for several months. That really bugs me, because I have barely compensated the expenses to become a seller (not only the vendor-account but also equipment and stuff). <br />I would be very happy to start vending again in a year or so (and then permanent), but somehow I have the feeling that SR and onion-net get more and more public attention and that&#039;s where I start to think that someone will take it down sooner or later.<br /><br /><br />So I would be very happy if someone could explain to me if there is hope for me :)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />a random user.

				I dont know how possible it would be but the thing is, if SR is taken down 5 more sites like it will pop up. The only way to stop .onion drug buying is to take down the tor network.

				When I first began shopping here I would lose sleep thinking about this, I would come on at least twice a day simply to make sure it was still here and would shit a brick whenever it wouldn&#039;t load. Eventually you need to just stop stressing it. Nobody knows for sure what the future holds but there is no sense panicking over it. Whatever happens I really do believe the internet is the future when it comes to buying drugs

				My hope is the cat is out of the bag - the technology, user base, drive and interest to run an operation like SR are all now a proven thing and if some authorities whack SR, clampdown on controlling/monitoring/regulating the bitcoin economy, and even if they make it impossible to use tor for these sort of activities, it won&#039;t be long before another SR type operation using similar technologies pops up.&nbsp; I like to view SR as the next phase of evolution in what is essentially an unstoppable economic force - the human drive to alter consciousness - the recreational drug trade.<br /><br />That&#039;s just a hope though, in reality I&#039;ve no idea if SR &amp; SR clones will become a constant fixture that the drug warriors cannot cut off or if some enforcement agency will find a way to destroy it.&nbsp; I am however confident that drug prohibition will only continue to stoke a trade than cannot be stopped.

				Oh the cat is out of the bag.&nbsp; As long as TOR or I2P or some of the other anoynmous networks are out there, SR-like sites will live on forever.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe this hasn&#039;t been posted here yet, but there&#039;s an open source project called bitwasp which is specially designed to an anonymous on-line market place any half-tech savvy person can use. <br /><br />Pandora is out of the box!&nbsp; ;D

Is it still being developed? Any website with news on it?<br /><br />A mature open source app like this really will change things. The only reason there aren&#039;t more sites like SR is because of the barrier of development. Plenty of people can set up a webserver, do some basic config and coding, but building from scratch is the big hurdle<br /><br />Viva la revolution
