				Sometimes some transactions take longer. They may have thought it was the same transaction and fucked up in realizing they are different. It&#039;s only been 5 hours. Grueling, I know, but not long. I&#039;ve had about 400 dollars go missing for a month. <br />Did you deposit into mtgox first or what deposit method from bitinstant did you use?<br />Wait until it&#039;s been 24 hours, then contact bitinstant if you haven&#039;t used a 3rd party like mtgox. Contact both companies if you used both. But don&#039;t write in all caps. I feel like I&#039;m being screamed at and there&#039;s no reason for that.<br /><br />Edit: grammar, contradiction. And their service works 24/7 (unless they have site issues-not often at all) but their support hours are on their page. I think there&#039;s even a live chat.
