				Hi<br />I&#039;m a new vendor on SR and I&#039;m having an issue with some encrypted messages being sent. After I import a user&#039;s publick key but copying and paste into Kleooptra by going right clicking on the task bar icon - Clipboard - Certificate Import then trying to decrypt the message by right clicking on the task bar icon again - Decrypt/Verfiry I sometimes get the verification data failed message.<br /><br />Ideally I&#039;d let to get this sorted today and will check out the pgp thread in the newbie section but if anyone can help I&#039;d throw a little free acid or a couple of pills they&#039;re way (Yes I am a vendor).<br /><br />Felix

				Felix, I have PM&#039;d you.&nbsp; I just wanted to reiterate; you do not need someone&#039;s PGP Key in order to decrypt a message from them.&nbsp; If they have YOUR public key, they will be able to encrypt a message to your Private Key, which only YOU have, therefore only YOU can decrypt(and you CAN decrypt) their message.<br /><br />Importing THEIR Public Key(Certification) is only so that you can ENCRYPT messages TO them.<br /><br />Make sense?

				FelixUK, Praetorian is absolutely correct.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Here is a basic guide I wrote if you want to use GPA.<br /><br />1. Copy the Public Key of the person you want to send a message to.<br /><br />2. Open a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the Public Key. Name the file and save it to your desired location on your PC.<br /><br />3. Open GPA (Gpg4win), click IMPORT, locate the file you just saved with the Public Key in it, and double click it. It will then show up in KEY MANAGER where it is stored for future use along with any other Public Keys you wish to keep.<br /><br />4. Then click on CLIPBOARD, the 2nd icon in from the right at the top of the page. Type the message you wish to send to the recipient and then click ENCRYPT. Click on the Public Key of the person your sending the message to (should now be highlighted), then click OK at the bottom.<br /><br />5. Then copy the encrypted message and paste it in a PM to the recipient and send it.<br /><br />6. REMEMBER - Include your Own Public Key in this message if you wish to receive an encrypted response from the recipient. You can find this by RIGHT-CLICKING your key in KEY MANAGER, then copy/pasting it. :)<br /><br />Hope that helps you out. :) :)

				Just to second Praetorian&#039;s statement, by listing your public key, you will allow others to encrypt their messages in your &quot;secret language.&quot; After you receive said message, you will be able to decrypt it with your decryption passkey and read it normally. As Praetorian said, you would only need their public key in order to send them an encrypted message that only they could decrypt. In my experience, placing your public key on your vendor page is the normal procedure for vendors like yourself. That would allow others to send you messages that only you would be able to decrypt. Hope this is helpful.
