				either mtgox or for real anonymity I suggest sending vlad1m1r a PM, he is pretty active on the forums but has a listing on SR also, you can basically send him cash in the post, he will then credit your wallet with BTC once the cash is received and converted to BTC.

				Intersango is the main UK site for bitcoins. It is an exchange, takes a hour to maybe work it out so you bid on a lower price than the asking price.<br /><br />They used to accept payment via bank order which was good.<br /><br />Now its a case of most having to buy via bank accounts which some would be suspicious of but BTC are not proof of anything. People invest in them. I buy off a guy who openly buys BTC and maybe if we all done that it would make BTC more stable and more difficult to use purchases as proof of anything untoward!<br /><br />Sending cash to buy BTC, the vendor is likely using a smart way to get a good return on BTC earned elsewhere.<br /><br />The person mentioned does have a good rep.<br /><br />I just hate paying fees when we pay fees for BTC and fees here.<br /><br />But its fair to charge a fee of course so good luck if you go that route.<br /><br />Also, had anyone here invested in 1000 BTC a few months back they would be looking at a massive return considering the small time scale. When I first saw BTC it was £2 something, now its almost £5. Think about it, legally speaking, the people selling BTC can not be touched unless they are also vendors reselling BTC.<br /><br />I even asked my boss for a bonus we are crying for to be paid 50% BTC.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />No shit.<br /><br />Boss likes recreational things. Snorting coke and flying s model airplane. <br /><br />Laters.

				If you&#039;re in the UK,&nbsp; vlad1m1r is probably your best bet; no dealing with banks or any buildings with security cameras. Of course, buying bitcoins is perfectly legal, but it never hurts to add as many layers of protection as obscuration as possible. Wish there was somebody like&nbsp; vlad1m1r in the US, but I haven&#039;t heard of anyone.

Your only defence is to make sure you use cash to buy your coins or sell goods/services in exchange for BTC via an online marketplace.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

Snorting coke and flying s model airplane. <br /><br />Laters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Red,<br /><br />Thanks for your thoughts.<br /><br />As it said in the last issue of Bitcoin Magazine, it would be wonderful to see Bitcoins being accepted more into the mainstream community. For instance Chinese&nbsp; Citizens who are forced to plough their savings into below par state run savings schemes could use BTC to play the stock market in order to raise capital for their families&nbsp; - I really hope this takes off!<br /><br />In the mean time, I&#039;m afraid we&#039;re left in a situation, particularly in the UK where guilt can be inferred from a person&#039;s silence and in the scenario I outlined below where someone accepts a package into their home in all innocence it would be down to them to construct a defence that they didn&#039;t know it contained anything illegal.<br /><br />If the recent scandals with Barclays and HSBC (I work for another UK High Street Bank) have taught us anything it is that the British are very much a blame-centric culture. Banks are desperate to avoid scandals and as I mentioned in another thread earlier today, this has resulted in a practice where at the very least my own bank is sharing routine financial information with the Police on a daily basis.<br /><br />This in itself shouldn&#039;t come as a surprise as naturally we file reports for suspicious account activity for follow up by various Financial Crimes Units but I&#039;m sure none of you are naive enough to think that an Investigating Officer needs a warrant every time he or she wants a peek at a person&#039;s bank records - When I was actually present when a Police Officer came to see footage of a 15 year old defendant paying in a few £50 notes into his account that he&#039;d stolen from a relative (I think it was his mother or gran).<br /><br />I do use several bank accounts to purchase my Bitcoins but they are structured and used in such a way they cannot be traced back to me. I don&#039;t say that no one else could do this but I was taught the technique I use by a colleague who&#039;s been working in Finance for nearly 30 years. Of course what I&#039;m doing is perfectly legal but I&#039;d rather not have the kind of attention that comes from buying BTC.<br /><br />I agree it might rankle slightly to pay a commission on obtaining your coins but paying £5 extra for £35 worth of Bitcoins for instance is a very small price indeed to pay for the peace of mind a service like mine offers, in my humble opinion. <br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Does anyone know if there are reliable BTC traders on SR in the USA? That&#039;s a lot of acronyms. Anyway I feel like that&#039;s the safest route.
