				Is anyone willing to trade bitcoin for voucher codes? I&#039;d just rather not have the hassle getting bitcoins through the bank system at the moment. So say I buy a £100 voucher i would scratch off the code and email it to you, then you would transfer the market equivalent in bitcoins to me. Obviously trust is essential, could be done in parts e.g. sent in multiples of 10. I think its a good idea, there are lots of other sites you can get voucher codes for too in the shops.

I see Zdollaz has offered to help you, although I believe he&#039;s American and you&#039;re in the UK?<br /><br />I offer a service selling Bitcoins in exchange for cash in the mail (please see link below) for people in UK/Europe. This is the most anonymous method of obtaining Bitcoins along with selling goods/services in exchange for BTC.<br /><br />If you want to change a small amount, please feel free to do so, I do any amount from £1 up!<br /><br />Are you set up with PGP/GPG? If not feel free to ask for help.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />V.

				Hey vlad1m1r! I remember seeing a post you made mentioning the service you offer. My only concern would be that the cash could get lost somehow in the postal service.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Are there any other viable options for doing a transaction like this with you? I mean electronically as opposed to putting trust in the Royal Mail? I&#039;m sorry if you get asked that question alot, but I&#039;m new to anonymity regarding Bitcoins and general Bitcoin transactions. Just exploring all possible avenues&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />

I was actually thinking along the same lines as OP. I could buy a bunch of $10 gift cards and have someone send me bitcoins $9 worth at a time, each transfer followed by one gift card code. Whoever has to go first could be determined randomly somehow.<br /><br />So yeah, you or anyone has bitcoins to sell in exchange for codes I can buy at a store and email you let me know!
