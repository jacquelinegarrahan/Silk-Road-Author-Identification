				Word of warning especially to vendors, sometimes using just latex gloves ISN&#039;T enough to hide your prints. <br /><br />Fingerprints are left due to natural oils secreted from our skin, wearing gloves might prevent direct oil deposits, but what can happen is - if the latex is thin enough, your fingerprint groves of the glove can pick up powders/solvents/oils/chemicals/drugs and leave them deposited as prints. Try it, put on some gloves on, touch something even slightly oily and watch yourself leave your prints everywhere. (especially if your grip is firm enough).<br /><br />Use thicker latex non-powdered where possible; or better yet in combination with a glove made of cotton or leather. When ready to ship, wipe everything down. Be careful with stamps, there&#039;s no point going through all that only to leave a print on the back of a stamp.

				Agreed.&nbsp; A pair of single-use latex gloves is ineffective.&nbsp; Hell I even tried two pairs and found it to be inadequate.&nbsp; My test is to press my finger against the sticky part of packing tape.&nbsp; With a single glove my fingerprint is perfect for investigators.<br /><br />They are a pain in the ass to work with but I use thick gloves made of things like nitrile and vinyl and that have their own texture to them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used cotton in the past but don&#039;t like leaving fibers in the packages.<br /><br />I doubt many vendors bother to ensure their packages are without fingerprints.&nbsp; It definitely makes things a lot more tedious but to me it is essential.

				good post. <br />i always remind my vendors to care about fingerprints..<br /><br />cotton gloves are nice if you put a pair of latex or PE gloves on top of them. <br /><br />kitchen (elbow high) gloves are ok too. <br /><br /><br />mates, what is the best way to wipe envelopes and plastic packaging? (i know that oil and grease are good on metal, guns, etc).
