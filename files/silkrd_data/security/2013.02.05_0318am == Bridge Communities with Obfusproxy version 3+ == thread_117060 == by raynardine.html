				Some features that are being considered among Tor developers are greatly expanding the concept of bridges, which are used to hide the fact that you are using tor to hostile networks you may be forced to use (for lack of better options).<br /><br />Currently, bridge relays do not do much. Bridges are still published to a centralized &quot;Bridge Authority&quot; controlled by the core developers, who are known to fraternize with various national governments, especially the USA, and are semi-cautiously published with a captcha used to make it slightly more difficult to innumerate all of the bridge relays.<br /><br />In response to overwhelming criticism over the centralized nature and vulnerability of the bridge authority server and possible (read: pretty much 100% certain) exploitation by national governments, especially the USA, of this centralized infrastructure.<br /><br />The new concept of a Bridge Community changes all of that.<br /><br />You run your own bridge authority, and possibly a pool of bridge relays, then publish the IP:port pairs to that bridge authority. Your community members can then use a few IP:port pairs you give them directly to connect to the bridge community. These bridges then relay all traffic for that community into the wider public relay pool.<br /><br />This is a lot more stealthy than the current system, and a lot harder to block or even detect, with things like protocol obfuscation.<br /><br />This is a steganographic technique which embeds tor protocol within a cover protocol, which is designed to look normal and routine.<br /><br />This is used with bridge relays which have the feature enabled.<br /><br />To keep up with the inevitable arms race that will ensue when obfusproxy becomes more common among normal tor users, obfusproxy version 3 uses &quot;pluggable transports&quot; where you can easily design a new module for exploiting unintended features in underlying cover protocols.<br /><br />So, as a tor bridge community administrator, you can give your users a couple of IP:port addresses and a few very recent pluggable transport modules in order to hide the fact that they are even using tor in the first place, much less allowing adversaries to observe your traffic and discern whom is communicating with whom.<br /><br />This is the future of tor, if the core tor developers have any brains.

Also although Tor project developers very frequently meet up with law enforcement and such, they are to the best of my ability to tell not in cooperation with law enforcement at all. Mostly they just tell them the basics of how Tor works, shit that all of us already know. Also Tor project very frequently gives the same information to a wide range of people, if I recall correctly they helped Wikileaks with their hidden service configuration as well. So they are pretty impartial about who they will talk about Tor with, but they are quite dedicated to Tor itself and keeping it as anonymous as they can for all who use it, and I do not think for one second that they will compromise Tor for anyone unless they are absolutely forced to (and even still there isn&#039;t much they can do , although they could be forced to give up bridge IP addresses perhaps. EFF lawyers back them up for free, so they have access to a pretty powerful group of lawyers to help defend them from legal attacks). <br /><br />I would also like to point out that although from an active internal perspective, the distribution of Tor nodes makes it unlikely for such an attacker to correlate traffic, but from a passive external point of view it is quite likely that the US government can correlate large amounts of Tor traffic. NSA has access to multiple Narus Insight super computers with direct access to major IX&#039;s in the USA, so it is very likely that they can externally monitor a lot of Tor traffic passing through nodes they don&#039;t own. Thankfully NSA is prohibited by law from using this intelligence against Americans who are not in contact with terrorist or foreign intelligence agencies, and I think they are actually restricted to only targeting terrorists and foreign intelligence agencies in the first place. Of course they do whatever the fuck they want, but they don&#039;t want to fuck with us.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bridge enumeration is mainly a problem in China and other places that actively block connections to the Tor network.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Mostly, although it can also be a problem for people trying to find bridge users to do other attacks, particularly known rough geolocation + Tor client enumeration &amp; geolocation to narrow in on shippers. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, it seems to introduce a new problem: the bridge authority operator is linked to the users.

				My problem with bridges is that it&#039;s still possible to prove that I was connected to the Tor network at a given time, even if I used bridges, because my ISP has the list of IPs I was connected to, and LEA can check the IP&#039;s by trying to use them as a bridge in Tor.<br /><br />So if LEA knows that someone was blogging some shit&nbsp; through Tor, and somehow they find me, then they check the the IP addresses I was connected to when those blog posts were made. Then they try to use those IPs as a bridge in Tor, if it works then they know I was using Tor at every single time when those posts were made, this is more than enough to put me in jail here where I live.<br /><br />Maybe if the bridge IPs would be distributed along with a password, and without the password the bridge would not reveal itself as a bridge would solve this problem.

				That&#039;s true, it&#039;s different for shippers. They should be taking added security measures. It is easy to get a list of the public relays, and there are only about 800 entry guards, so LE could contact the main ISPs of that city and ask for all users who connect to those IP addresses. The density of Tor users is fairly low, so it would be a short list. Getting all the bridges is a lot harder, but not impossible. Bridges could still be useful by making LE&#039;s job harder. A VPN also might help in that situation, but you would want to get one outside of your country.<br /><br />A private, unpublished bridge with obfuscation would be the safest. Rent some VPSes in Iceland or Malaysia and set up bridges, LE won&#039;t know to look at those. I mean, connections to those IPs will be lost in the tens of thousands of other IP addresses that users in that city connect to on a daily basis.<br />

				For clearnet I use a quite good VPN service. It&#039;s located in countries that respect privacy, freedom and don&#039;t keep logs and it&#039;s an IP shared with thousand of clients. Can I use it as a bridge for TOR?

				No, but you could use it to connect to a bridge.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see the point of that, though. If you are confident that your VPN doesn&#039;t keep logs, you might as well connect to public relays through it.
