				The only way, that I would know how to do this, would be to go to a jewelery store, or even a webuygold place, and have them weigh it out for you. You can either have them buy it for you, or if you have patience sell it privately to a trusted person for cash. <br /><br />I would honestly save your gold though. If you&nbsp; really have pure gold bullions, their price can only go up; at the moment at least.

				Swap meets.&nbsp; There is a lot of gold being bought and sold at those.&nbsp; My local swap meet I can sell gold for cash at $50 under spot.&nbsp; No questions asked.&nbsp;

				If you&#039;re comfortable in the setting, you can also find out where your local Mises/Austrian economics/Libertarian group is. There will be plenty of people there willing to trade cash for gold, no documents necessary.

If you don&#039;t need the USD at the moment, hold on to it. Gold is a great secure investment at the moment. I don&#039;t believe some analysts saying Gold will be $3,000 by the end 2014, but I think $2,500 will be closer to the mark. <br />Otherwise if you wanted to take a bit more of a risk, buy BTC with the gold. I think you can only make money investing in BTC. If U.S. finds a way of banning it in the U.S, prices will sky rocket.....If they find a way to shut it down everywhere........FUCK
