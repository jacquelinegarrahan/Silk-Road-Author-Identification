				I&#039;ve been reading everything I can find, but there&#039;s so much conflicting advice. I haven&#039;t bought any Bitcoins yet, but before I&#039;d read much I went ahead and opened accounts at Dwolla and Mt.Gox using my real ID, bank info, etc. Would it really be way too risky to just transfer money from my bank to Dwolla, use it to buy Bitcoins at Mt.Gox, and move them to Silk Road?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Here&#039;s what I have always done.<br />Make an acct at mtgox and use the cash bank deposit option. It will redirect you &quot;BitInstant.com&quot;, then to a site called &quot;TrustCash&quot; to complete your deposit invoice. You can chose from any Chase or Bank of America close to you. Go to the bank with your cash and you will be given instructions from mtgox on how to correctly fill out the deposit slip. No ID or personal information is needed! Make your deposit and usually by the time you get home you will have the dollars in your mtgox acct. From there, using mtgox, you convert your dollars into bitcoins. Then, send your btc to a wallet (I use instawallet), and from there send them to your SR acct. After you do it once you&#039;ll get the procedure down pat and you&#039;ll have your btc withing an hour or two, start to finish. Just make sure you NEVER access mtgox.com through TOR. Each time you need to access mtgox just use your regular internet explorer. Its a pain in the ass to switch back and forth but Mtgox will block and report you if they detect that you access their site through TOR.<br />Good luck!

				Thanks very much to you both! Buying Bitcoins from SR seems the least scary to me, so I may try that first.<br /><br />Cacoethes, you said to buy a &quot;Green Dot&quot; Moneypak, but Sugar Mama says &quot;Buy a moneypak reload card and put money on it at the register. Do NOT buy a prepaid greendot debit card.&quot; Can you make sense of that for me? Thanks! (BTCBuddy&#039;s account is inactive.)

The whole thing is made of cardboard.&nbsp; On the back of the Moneypak, at the bottom, is a scratch-off coating that underneath reveals the Moneypak code.<br /><br />The Green Dot Pre-paid debit card is exactly that- A pre-paid debit card like one from Visa or Mastercard.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy enough to tell the difference, and you get them at the checkout register amongst all the other impulse-buy stuff.<br /><br />Be very careful here... NOT BTCBUDDY.&nbsp; It&#039;s BTC Buddy, and he&#039;s just in stealth mode.&nbsp; Go here to see his vendor page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3ade97b152<br /><br />HTH!
