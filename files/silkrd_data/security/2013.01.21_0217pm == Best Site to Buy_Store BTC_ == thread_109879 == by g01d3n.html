				Hey there everyone, I was just wondering what sites you recommend buying/storing your valuable BTC. I was using coinbase, but due to an anomaly in my funds, i think it&#039;s best for me to move on.<br />Thank you very much for your time.

				My opinion is that buying and storing are sort of 2 separate things, granted they can be the same depending on your comfort level...<br /><br />Buying...&nbsp; Seems like you are not interested in more &quot;legit&quot; methods of getting coin (coinbase, MtGox etc).&nbsp; Here are some cash to BTC services...<br /><br />- Blue Sky Traders (http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion.to/index.htm) : Bank of America direct deposit<br /><br />- Bitcopia (https://bitcopia.com/index.php):&nbsp; Wells Fargo direct deposit - I just used this service the other day, fast but WF did mess up with info and for faster service I had to email pic of receipt.<br /><br />- Bitinstant.com (Bitinstant.com):&nbsp; Big boy on the block, many options (btc to wallet or email)... common is moneygram from almost any walmart.&nbsp; Charges % and a flat rate on top for moneygram vendor (for sure flat rate not sure how much %).<br /><br />- Local Bitcoins (https://localbitcoins.com/): Buy bitcoins in your area in person via cash.&nbsp; Pretty much open market for people to sell BTC locally via meet up and other methods.&nbsp; In my area deals didn&#039;t seem that good, but maybe you would have better luck.<br /><br /><br />Wallets and storing BTC<br /><br />First thing, ewallets provided by websites/exchanges are only as secure as the vendor trust.&nbsp; MtGox was hacked even a few years back which resulted in some loss of coin.&nbsp; These are not backed by the government so deposits are not insured except by the provider (if that).&nbsp; These should imo only be used for small amounts of BTC that you can afford to loose given worst case scenarios.&nbsp; If you want more secure storage, you can look into creating a local wallet using a BTC client.&nbsp; This way you can even store/back up BTC on a flash drive (I think some ewallet services have import/export btc features too!).<br /><br />Common e-wallets (there are tons these I just see mentioned the most)<br /><br />- Blockchain.info : Probably the most commonly mentioned, can even send anonymously (mix coins before send) for 1.5% flat rate.&nbsp; Uses account login.<br /><br />- instawallet.org :&nbsp; Popular temp wallet, just go to site and it will assign a random wallet/address.&nbsp; No fees, no logins.&nbsp; Only way to get to wallet is by url given on that page, lose url,&nbsp; BTC are gone.&nbsp; Lots of people send BTC to these this service and then send to SR.&nbsp; Rumor is that service will mix coins but the one time I used it, it didn&#039;t (to be fair they had issue where transactions weren&#039;t being completed, once fixed they all went through ok just no mixing).

				Blockchain.info as a wallet service (for common use). For long term saving use paper wallets (cold storage) with offline generated bitcoin addresses.

				Get your personal wallet on http://electrum.org/<br /><br />I am not going to explain it to you. All the info you need is on that link. Needless to say, that is what I use.
