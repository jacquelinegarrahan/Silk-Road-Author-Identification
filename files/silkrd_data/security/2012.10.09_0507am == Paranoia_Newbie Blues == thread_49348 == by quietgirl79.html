				Okay, so I ordered from a vendor four days ago and finally four days later the vendor replies back to me, apologizing that they were out of town.&nbsp; Not just that, but they said there is a problem with their PGP key and the will have to use one.&nbsp; (The vendor did ask me to use Privnote, and after some research I&#039;ve decided against that.)<br /><br />So how paranoid should I be that this vendor could be compromised, and that LE hasn&#039;t been able to decrypt the vendor&#039;s key so they so they can generate a new one?&nbsp; Should I only trust the old key from before the vendor was &#039;out of town&#039;?&nbsp; Or is it a common problem that people need new PGP keys from time to time?<br /><br />The vendor is two months old.&nbsp; I can name the vendor, but I don&#039;t want to breach etiquette.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please help, I&#039;m very scared, should I just walk away?&nbsp; (though if the vendor can be trusted I would like to continue, as I&#039;ve noticed prices have increased as MtGox values decrease..maybe no relationship?)&nbsp; :-[

				Okay...this girl IS being paranoid.&nbsp; The vendor canceled the order because it was about to expire or something like that.&nbsp; They said to order, if I wanted to.&nbsp; Just sucks because the price changed by over a BTC since I ordered :\

I suggest you email the vendor and tell them to get their ship in order. That way you can give them feedback on lost custom.<br /><br />If they don&#039;t change their ways, don&#039;t let it bother you. Better to have superior operational security. You&#039;ll be feel a whole lot better if it turns out SR server&#039;s are compromised by LE hackers.<br /><br />The entire op should run as if hacking the SR servers doesn&#039;t matter. If you use PGP, that is completely true. If you don&#039;t, you&#039;re fucked. That&#039;s putting it in the most pleasant manner I can.<br /><br />Vendors should get professional or go home. There&#039;s no room for amateurs on here. Or rather, there is room, but they have to learn, or they will get busted ASAP. Maybe not now, but like you&#039;re saying, if a vendor doesn&#039;t take PGP seriously, there&#039;s every chance they don&#039;t get other elementary precautions seriously either.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Pine<br /><br />

				Let me try a short answer here ....Private note is a 3rd party server that destroys the note from the sender or recipient from being able to view the note again, nobody can guarantee that the server does not have a record of this transaction or could be<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.<br />&nbsp;Benjamin Franklin<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t use privnote period. It&#039;s unsecure.<br />2nd there is more than one vendor for virtually anything you might want to buy on SR so if the vendor can&#039;t get their act together on PGP etc MOVE ON and order from another vendor.

				I&#039;m just curious. I swear by PGP.

It should be really simple to uninstall gpa completely, remove any files that have to do with it and re-install, make a new key. Bam. Done.

				I agree totally.&nbsp; And no, not for that particular item, but a lot of sellers I ask these days say they&#039;ll have a PGP, but then let ou know later its not working.<br /><br />The only thing that makes me paranoid about the new key bit is that you don&#039;t know if the new key creator is the same person as the person who had the old key (ie., compromised).&nbsp; Because from a safety point of view, only the person using the PGP would have the proper key to encrypt or decrypt communications, so someone who can recover their old key is hopefully more reliable and hasn&#039;t been turned into sa a honeypot<br /><br />But as consumers I encourage everyone to encourage their vendors to step up and require PGP.&nbsp; After all, in my head, someone who has PGP is hopefully more educated, more careful, more stealthy, and basically has their shit together better than someone who might now; just theoretically speaking..<br /><br />Play smart, and play safe yall.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;3

				honestly speaking IMO nothing is THAT wrong with privnote<br /><br />It is fine to be uber cautious and avoid it, perhaps the admins of privnote have turned and are keeping a log of everything that the feds are voraciously reading however note that the feds would ALSO have to have hacked SR and thus be connecting orders to privnotes.

They don&#039;t need to hack into the Silk Road specifically, they just need to arrange for an &quot;alternative&quot; code module to be run when accessed via a node from the Tor network. The exit nodes are publicly known. Uninteresting notes would be filtered from those which are from &#039;persons of interest&#039;. Stop thinking of it as a &#039;targeting system&#039; specifically created for the sole purpose of destroying SR, it&#039;s more like part of a &#039;trawling system&#039;.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think of Privnote being used as a source of evidence all by itself per se, but as a source of intelligence gathering. Privnote itself is merely an obvious *archetype* of something that could be a honeypot, there are many potential similar suspect services, such as Tormail, Anonfiles or Freedom Hosting. The majority of these services must be honeypots, or it is pragmatic to assume such. We are not believing that they are all DEA honeypots, that would be quite remarkable even though the DEA undoubtedly must have a significant presence judging from its bizarre geographical distribution (it&#039;s... not exactly a drug enforcement agency, reports from wikileaks say it is actually part of an intelligence network for a larger concern). In fact we live in a digital jungle we need to navigate, where the DEA&#039;s and SOCA&#039;s e-crime divisions are merely some of the smaller minnows darting about. This world has literally thousands of private and public intelligence agencies with different agendas, who would be willing to trade data for data.<br /><br />In fact, LEO does not need to intercept communications to a particular gathering place for information directly (unless it&#039;s part of the exploit), they just need to compromise the ISP.<br /><br />In such a jungle, there is only 1 real defense, and that is public key cryptography. Bitcoin, Tor and PGP come from this.<br /><br />You have to remember that the ethos of SR is the following:<br /><br />1. Everybody on SR is an agent.<br />2.

That way when LE bust you, they only have thin client, no digital footprint.

It is an abstraction where there are different &#039;layers&#039; to the network. At the top is the Application layer, things like Firefox, Apache. Regular programs people and servers run. At the bottom there is the Physical layer, which literally is the 1s and 0s zooming over the copper wires or fiber optic cable. <br /><br />Tor provides network security, which is sandwiched in the middle of those two layers. It prevents your IP address being known. It does not anonymize the Physical layer (probably impossible) or the Application layer (the programs being used). Well, actually it does try to standardize the Application layer so everybody&#039;s &#039;browser fingerprint&#039; is similar, which is a case for not adjusting the settings on your Tor Browser Bundle very much or at all. But the core thing is that it prevents somebody else obtaining your real IP address, that is the main thing Tor does.<br /><br />Where people get confused, is that their Internet traffic going into and traversing the Tor network is encrypted, but not at the Application layer because that&#039;s impossible. The programs you are running on Tor and the communications they are making are not encrypted in of themselves. I mean if you request a webpage such as this one on Tor, then the program handling the webpage at your end can&#039;t be encrypted. You computer would have no idea how to interpret the webpage. First the webpage must be decrypted, then it is sent to your browser to display.<br /><br />A related issue of confusion over encryption is that if your application like the browser sends your real IP address as part of the data it is sending out at the Application layer. e.g. &quot;e.g. Hello webserver, I am web browser and this is my IP address&quot;, then Tor doesn&#039;t do anything to stop that because it can&#039;t. Notably BitTorrent software does something like this which is why it&#039;s not advisable to use BitTorrent with Tor.<br /><br />Again, Tor only prevents your IP address getting out at the Network Level. Not at the level of Software deciding to give your IP address away. Most of the time this is not malicious on the part of the software, the big problem is DNS leaks, where the software thinks it needs to obtain an IP address of another computer and resolve it to a domain name.<br /><br />Finally another related issue is that people think Tor encrypts all their stuff. I think this is an extreme example of &#039;technomagic&#039;, a fallacy in the comprehension of how encryption or frankly even logic works. Tor does not encrypt your emails from end to end. Tor does not encrypt your PMs from end to end on a forum such as this. Take this message I am writing for example. As it passes through the Tor network, it will be encrypted multiple times to achieve anonymity. But it when if &#039;surfaces&#039;, or is decrypted, it is plaintext. The fact you are reading it means it&#039;s plaintext! Again: application layer is not encrypted, that goes on at the network layer.<br /><br />Similarly on SR when you send your address to a vendor, it is in plaintext. There is not technomagic wizardry that somehow encrypts it such that only the vendor can read it in plaintext. It has to be stored as plaintext in order for the vendor to read it at all! Anybody, and I do mean anybody, with access can read that message. Hence PGP Club.<br /><br />The solutions to all those misunderstandings are simple.<br /><br />A: Always use PGP when doing incriminating things like sending your address to a vendor of illicit contraband!<br />B: Ensure you don&#039;t do exotic (e.g. &quot;To speed up Tor&quot;) things to the Tor Browser Bundle or however you&#039;re using Tor. You&#039;ll stand out if you do. Anonymity is all about being a member of a crowd. Run with the shoals! Swim with the zebras! You get the idea.<br />C: Assume everything you&#039;re writing is being logged and examined by LE agents wasting the public&#039;s tax dollars, and behave accordingly.<br /><br />C means;<br /><br />No &quot;Wow! What a great TV show last night!&quot;.<br />No &quot;It&#039;s a nice morning&quot;.<br />No. &quot;LOL, I was on reddit and...&quot;<br />No. &quot;Take a look at this youtube video!&quot;<br />No &quot;I just bought this book/movie/music/software&quot;<br /><br />No. No. No. No. No. But yes, perhaps you should drop breadcrumbs for your own canary, but don&#039;t get too clever either or you&#039;ll wind up being more stupid than clever. Millions of people think of nothing but releasing fabulously detailed TMI about the minutiae of their daily lives, it&#039;s not difficult to create a believable alt.<br /><br />A, B are essential, C is for the lulz and wearing down the adversary. I assure you you have enemies and they are very real indeed. This fact cannot ever be forgotten. You are arrayed against the forces of our respective police states. DPR is correct. Merely being on this hidden service is a revolutionary act, whether you all believe it or not. One day they will come with us and we shall wield all the power of the world to create a new social and political order but until then remember we are allied against a powerful adversary. We shall play to our strengths and use the market against them. For the most experienced members of this forum this was never about the money. This is about revenge. Of peers locked in cages and death for some, of being helpless against the absurdity of the Drug War for others.They have never met an enemy like us. In all my life I have never once seen such a powerful force for social and political change as the Darknet.

Tor does not encrypt your PMs from end to end on a forum such as this. Take this message I am writing for example. As it passes through the Tor network, it will be encrypted multiple times to achieve anonymity. But it when if &#039;surfaces&#039;, or is decrypted, it is plaintext. The fact you are reading it means it&#039;s plaintext! Again: application layer is not encrypted, that goes on at the network layer.<br /><br />Similarly on SR when you send your address to a vendor, it is in plaintext. There is not technomagic wizardry that somehow encrypts it such that only the vendor can read it in plaintext. It has to be stored as plaintext in order for the vendor to read it at all! Anybody, and I do mean anybody, with access can read that message. Hence PGP Club.<br /><br />The solutions to all those misunderstandings are simple.<br /><br />A: Always use PGP when doing incriminating things like sending your address to a vendor of illicit contraband!<br />B: Ensure you don&#039;t do exotic (e.g. &quot;To speed up Tor&quot;) things to the Tor Browser Bundle or however you&#039;re using Tor. You&#039;ll stand out if you do. Anonymity is all about being a member of a crowd. Run with the shoals! Swim with the zebras! You get the idea.<br />C: Assume everything you&#039;re writing is being logged and examined by LE agents wasting the public&#039;s tax dollars, and behave accordingly.<br /><br />C means;<br /><br />No &quot;Wow! What a great TV show last night!&quot;.<br />No &quot;It&#039;s a nice morning&quot;.<br />No. &quot;LOL, I was on reddit and...&quot;<br />No. &quot;Take a look at this youtube video!&quot;<br />No &quot;I just bought this book/movie/music/software&quot;<br /><br />No. No. No. No. No. But yes, perhaps you should drop breadcrumbs for your own canary, but don&#039;t get too clever either or you&#039;ll wind up being more stupid than clever. Millions of people think of nothing but releasing fabulously detailed TMI about the minutiae of their daily lives, it&#039;s not difficult to create a believable alt.<br /><br />A, B are essential, C is for the lulz and wearing down the adversary. I assure you you have enemies and they are very real indeed. This fact cannot ever be forgotten. You are arrayed against the forces of our respective police states. DPR is correct. Merely being on this hidden service is a revolutionary act, whether you all believe it or not. One day they will come with us and we shall wield all the power of the world to create a new social and political order but until then remember we are allied against a powerful adversary. We shall play to our strengths and use the market against them. For the most experienced members of this forum this was never about the money. This is about revenge. Of peers locked in cages and death for some, of being helpless against the absurdity of the Drug War for others.They have never met an enemy like us. In all my life I have never once seen such a powerful force for social and political change as the Darknet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Awesome tips Pine!&nbsp; Any info I give is misinformation.&nbsp; Just kidding, I always tell the truth.&nbsp; Sometimes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for your explanations too.&nbsp; Without true understanding of how all this technology people do seem to fall back on superstitious behaviors.&nbsp; Like that change identity button.&nbsp; Does that do anything?&nbsp; Or does hitting that more often make me more visible?&nbsp; The problem for me is that all these computers and things all exist in like an imaginary world.&nbsp; And sometimes its hard to grasp all this abstract stuff.&nbsp; And that highlights the problem of &quot;technomagic&quot;, where I still meet users that think they are &quot;fully covered&quot; because they are using TOR (on their main machine...).&nbsp; Or don&#039;t want to discuss things in PGP.&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder how some of these people haven&#039;t been caught.<br /><br />I like the idea of an alt, though.&nbsp; They are useful in case of a good forensic psychologist.&nbsp; I had a colleague who could tell you some interesting stories.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I see it less as a war (though I do agree with the spirit and it certainly could be seen as a war in terms of battle, ideology, etc) and more as getting goods and services that I require that not only does not harm others, but has health benefits.&nbsp; In addition, And I agree, the War on Drugs is a big failure.&nbsp; Funny thing is I was one of their poster childs.&nbsp; I was really hurt when I realized the authority was lying&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />In any case, its almost morning here, and I need to get to bed for a night shift.&nbsp; Be safe, ya&#039;ll<br />
