				On the BST website it says they can no longer send email conformations to Tor Mail.... My question is what are some other deep-net e-mail sites? Cuz I know of none besides Tor mail&nbsp; :o <br /><br />

				There are none. You can use a clearnet site over Tor, like safe-mail.net. Disable IP checking in the preferences so it doesn&#039;t log you out when you switch exit nodes every 10 minutes.<br />

				LOL, I teach myself something new every day too. :)<br /><br />Safe Mail was the de facto standard for a time in between Hushmail and Tormail.<br /><br />Remember to PGP encrypt all sensitive emails if you decide to use it.

				is safe-mail hosted on the clearnet? if it is hosted on clearnet, then if LE finds them and seizes their severs, won&#039;t they have access to sensitive information? But I guess that using PGP would encrypt all sensitive info so we&#039;re still good there. and since you use safe-mail through tor, LE can&#039;t track the IP address back to you?

				Right, Safe Mail is clearnet, which comes with certain risks that you are protected against with Tormail. The trade off is that Safe Mail has been around for at least a decade and has reliable uptime. They also provide POP access, so you can use Thunderbird + Enigmail + Torbirdy.<br /><br />Torbirdy will automatically configure Thunderbird to use Tor, plus it does some other things to protect your anonymity, such as changing the time zone to GMT and scrubbing metadata from the email header. Enigmail integrates PGP, so you can do transparent de/encryption of your emails. Most importantly, with POP mail, you can download your mail and store it locally, so if LE asked for your account info (the operators are in Israel or some place anyway), they would find nothing, not even encrypted emails (assuming the Safe Mail operators don&#039;t keep your email).<br /><br />And of course, the server logs would only show that exit nodes accessed the account.<br />

				so would it be true that if you used Tor and PGP you can use even gmail and you would still stay anonymous?

				Technically, yes.<br /><br />However, it&#039;s much harder to create a Google account over Tor. You will most likely have to get a burner phone to SMS verify your account and there may be other difficulties and blocks when accessing the account from many different IPs triggers their security mechanisms.<br />

				yes. gmail would never be feasible because of the whole phone verification. I think yahoo doesn&#039;t phone verify. and is the IP problem would be the same as the facebook via TOR I asked about a few weeks back?

				Yahoo, Hotmail both can be setup and accessed via Tor with no problem. I wonder why BST killed their Tormail support though. Strange days we are experiencing..

				He killed support for it because it was not reliable, at least thats my understanding.&nbsp; He needs to have reliable communication with his buyers in order to have prompt, professional service.

				So now that BST no longer excepts tormail or safe-mail what e-mail services are people using to stay anonymous with BST now??<br /><br /><br />I read you could use yahoo-mail through tor and turn off IP checking so it doesn&#039;t keep logging you out through tor. But is this the safest route?? And how do yo turn off IP checking???? cant find it nowhere right now..<br /><br />
