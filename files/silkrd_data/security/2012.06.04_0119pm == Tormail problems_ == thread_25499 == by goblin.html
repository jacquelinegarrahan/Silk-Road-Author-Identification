				Me personally would be suspect of anything Tor related at the present time. I am one who tries to think of every eventuality and have it covered best I can.<br /><br />Personally I do not even feel secure using Tor now that the media has started it&#039;s whirlwind. It is when things are calm and seem the most secure that &quot;surprises &quot; and unexpected problems occur&nbsp; and in scenarios such as these or involving the Government&nbsp; surprises and problems seldom if ever happen out of coincidence or bad luck. Even the most fail safe plan will fail if the logic tools and resources used to&nbsp; devise the plan was tainted/tarnished and not what they appeared to be when you put them into place.<br /><br />I use Tor cause I have to use Tor to be here. But my personal recommendation as far as placing orders through venders and or chatting on these forums is if you are 99.% sure that you are secure from your end&nbsp; would be to war drive and place orders on someones open network. You would be on there 5-ten minutes tops. Depending on what you take the time to do and make sure your lap top is encrypted and mac address cloned of all things. Mac address can tie that computer used directly to you if ever&nbsp; searched and found and LEA has records and details of orders and where they originated from. Better to assume they do than assume they do not.<br /><br />Just my two cents. Take care and be safe everyone.

				My doubts in Tore come from the fact the United Stated Government was involved in it&#039;s writing, No Government creates and distributes with out having it&#039;s own backdoor&nbsp; as too do so would go against the ver principles they have in place. Give the public just enough&nbsp; intelligence to flap their lips awhile&nbsp; that no knows about&nbsp; No&nbsp; intelligent Gov just gives software of this kind out to the public&nbsp; . without first having a means and tool to take it back over when and if the time arrives.. TOR is already compromised I assure you of that.&nbsp; and if we are still here&nbsp; it is because&nbsp; 1. They are taking the time to gather intel and carefully lay the foundation to a massive amount of arrest or 2. The Gov is some how gaining from tor and silk roads existent. To allow it to remain up&nbsp; when they have no cause or reason to&nbsp; &nbsp;is the reason it&#039;s self. <br /><br />Remember this as well. The FBI the CIA&nbsp; and even the President&nbsp; do things that makes no sense to use. What we hear on the news&nbsp; about what is happening is nothing more than what the Gov made up to leak out so the press has something to bitch about.<br /><br />Anything the press&nbsp; receives from the Gov&nbsp; is simply&nbsp; what they want to hand you and what they want the public to believe and many&nbsp; times for good reason. You can not operate with success if the public&nbsp; at large knows all you are doing and planning.<br />

These are really super intelligent people at the Tor project. Do you really think any such trap wiouldn&#039;t have been completely cleansed/erased by them by now? They don&#039;t serve the entreched power structure, they want the people to have feww and opwn communicarion.<br /><br />On the other hand, it does bother me that they trumpet the fact on their home page that the military and law enforcement use Tor themselves, as if that was some wonderful selling point! Actually, that attitude is absilutely wrongheaded. These are instruments of repression and state advancement. One of these days I&#039;m gonna write them to complain about using that fact as a propaganda tool. Why doesn&#039;t everyone here too?<br /><br />goblin

				Well to me the problem it we base our security parameters around our intelligence&nbsp; and assuming they ever and are using every known tool&nbsp; to accomplish their job but the problem is Governments have tools and science and software that the public is not even aware exist much less put in place. <br /><br />Secrecy and stealth is their right hand&nbsp; to gather intelligence for their left hand.&nbsp; I never put anything out of the realm of possibilities.&nbsp;

				Guru you make xcellent points but my suggestion for wi-fi and your response to it&nbsp; &nbsp; I give only this answer. I said this in another thread <br /><br />This is one reason why I so encourage war-driving when making orders and&nbsp; signing on to finalize and I do not mean your local mcdonalds or&nbsp; coffee or&nbsp; any other business. Stay away from populated places cause of cameras EVERY where and what most fail to understand is&nbsp; cameras can be used to trace a person or car straight back home&nbsp; NOT ALWAYS&nbsp; but in many cases cause if they see you doing an illegal activity at point A&nbsp; and it&#039;s videos&nbsp; they will check the every camera at others stores&nbsp; to the north south east and west to see where you approached from&nbsp; then&nbsp; just follow that to another camera. hell if you live in a house or apt in a buissness district you could drive or walk 5 miles&nbsp; rob a place&nbsp; and just have your steppes traced right to your door by checking your steps from camera to camera.<br /><br />So always&nbsp; try and go to remote areas&nbsp; with subdivisions&nbsp; and war-drive and find an open network but BE CERTAIN&nbsp; you are secure on your end&nbsp; and clone your mac for sure at all times for anything not just thins. you are in and out of a danger zone made your order and drive on home
