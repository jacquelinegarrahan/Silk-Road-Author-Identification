				I was speaking to a person on the underground market board who told me they were posting listings for drugs shipped to your door step on craigslist.<br /><br />He would get an email from someone and he would tell them to buy a moneypak, which he would then trade to vendor on the road for coins, then he would purchase the product from a vendor on here. He acted as a middleman. Never actually touching product.<br /><br />What I wanted to know is how did he set up a Craigslist account over tor without being flagged, or craigslist asking for phone verification as it often does.<br /><br />Does this make sence? Make an account through torrified browser, put in tormail, when requested for verifcation buy a throw away phone. How would you ever get caught?<br />If you tried uploading a picture would that blow your security?<br /><br />

				Who knows, maybe he didn&#039;t use Tor at all. He could be an arrest waiting to happen.<br /><br />Or he could have used a VPN, or pointed his Tor Browser at a web proxy and used a phone purchased in cash for the verification. But my money is on the first option.<br />

				So then, would tor + VPN do it?<br />Not VPN+tor because craigslist wouldn&#039;t allow me
