				Hello, community! This is my first post here. I&#039;m new to silk road, but not the products!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways, I&#039;m looking for a way to use a credit/debit card, to safely obtain BC. In my search, I&#039;ve run across quite a bit of rubbish, and so I figured to come straight to the community for assistance. Can anyone point me in the direction of my needs? Like I said, I&#039;m new to the bit coin stuff, and I&#039;m kind of nervous, about being duped. I&#039;m not even sure I completely understand how it works. I get a tag like &quot;alsnd980232jmk;ndmsakl;84e&quot; and that series of characters is my BC account?

				https://btc-e.com/ offers CC as payment through interkassa, never tried myself but people on this forum has. It has a fee between 10% and 20%. Anyway, the cheapest way to get bitcoins is through bank transfers, almost no fee at all.<br /><br />That tag thing you said, it&#039;s your bitcoin address, just copy it when you do the withdrawal.<br /><br />GL in your order.

				Welcome to silk road!!! there are not two many credit card sites because its to easy to scam the site by charge backs. and if a site offers that be very wary of them.<br /><br />btcking or many of the sellers on this site under money will be happy to take your order though btcking at least will charge 10% which is not 2 bad if you get 200 worth thats only 20 dollars.<br /><br />also otcexchange execpts paypal but are invite only right now but keep your eye out because they will probebly open it up soon.<br /><br />lots of venders on here under money will do moneygram western union ect and there some where you can buy moneypak cards and give them the codes inexchange for bitcoin<br /><br />also theres one site that uses paypal but you have to buy other ecurrencys then tranfer it 2 bitcoin. it starts with a v maybe someone else can think of it

				Also, it&#039;s my understanding that the value of BC varies on the market? So I could say, exchange 100 USD for (I don&#039;t know the rate yet) 30 BC today, but tomorrow, I might get 40 BC, for the 100 USD?
