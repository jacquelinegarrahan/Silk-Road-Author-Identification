				Hi all!&nbsp; :) <br />Just started using truecrypt for tor-bundle and gpg4usb on a usb and its working great as an ecrypted file/partition, so Im thinking on using it for the hole system and creating a hidden volume, has anybody done that before and can tell how well it works? I&#039;m thinking mostly on system speed, i use my computer for Photoshop and music editing, so speed is a big issue for me. Is there anything else to think about, any tips?

				dont mix normal computer usage with illegal stuff, use tails for SR stuff.

				I have my entire PC&#039;s hard drive encrypted. I don&#039;t have any SR related things on it though. Just as a secondary measure. I use the option on my external passport &#039;use a hidden file container&#039; pretty easy to do. Truecrypt can seem intimidating at first *-*

				@ Masterblaseter, I dont use it on the pc, not anymore. The set up is exactly as jailbirdslanger described in a usb with fingerprint access only +truecrypt security. There are no files beeing created on the pc, everything is in the rom and cleared. And yesterday I did a 32 pass clearing of my free space area so there is no trace of anything left there. But I am looking into linux&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />jailbirdslanger, do you have you hardrive encrypted with truecrypt? Do you notice any speed loss when working with heavy softwares?

				You know man I bought a new HD when I started this SR ISH and yes I encrypted it entirely (not just the OS volume). I also have a passport for portability encrypted totally with the Hidden File Container. So going in knowing that, I actually still have seen some problems. Like my display adapter (geforce gtx465) sometimes will say (after a quick freeze) that it had an error but recovered. I also notice programs such as ccleaner having problems going at its normal speed. I will finish saying this, I was experiencing some of this stuff before I started SR/got this new HD. Except for the display adapter of course thats new.

				I agree with a comment above keep your personal computer clean - USB drives and encryption to be used for SR related matters as they are portable and easily destroyable<br /><br />Yes, they claim encryption on your personal computer if done right works - why take unnecessary risk?<br /><br />C8

				What would be the advantages to using Tails VS. using Truecrypt with a hidden volume on a USB drive thats contains TOR Browser Bundle, gpg4usb, and bitcoin-qt?&nbsp; If Any?&nbsp; &nbsp;Would using Tails on a Truecrypt hidden volume on a USB stick be a better option?&nbsp; &nbsp;Basically, will Tails provide me better security than using the regular TorBrowserBundle installed on a truecrpyt hidden volume?<br />

So the solution is to use a live OS like tails/libertie, which are suited for security purposes (they dont leave traces or leak, as everything is routed through tor). The problem you will run into however, is that while these live usbs allow you to open truecrypt containers fine and dandy, they dont store system settings or installed programs unless you setup persistence, which doesnt offer any sort of hidden volume, so if you want to really hide your stuff then put it in a safe place.

				&nbsp;I find the TC encryption decreases the performance speed by more than 6%. More like 20-30%.<br /><br />&nbsp;For any doubters out there who think that Truecrypt can be easily cracked read the story of the Brazilian banker &quot;Danial Dantas&quot; and &quot;Operation Satyagraha&quot;. <br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dantas
