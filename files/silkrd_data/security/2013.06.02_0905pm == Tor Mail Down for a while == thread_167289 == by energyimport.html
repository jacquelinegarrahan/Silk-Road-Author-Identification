Can I use that for BST? I see they are no longer accepting emails from Tormail or something?

				Squirrel mail is just tormail. You have a few options you can use to view your tormails though. One of those is squirrel mail. I have not heard BST requires an email that is not tormail. It would seem weird since they are on the dark web themselves.

We&#039;re now experiencing similar issues with the safe-mail.net domain. To be clear--we are not doing the blocking. We&#039;re just not getting your emails. Please use another email provider to place trading requests. <br /><br />That&#039;s the quote from their website. So now I&#039;m wondering what email service to use with them?

				If not tormail then I would not even use that service. Sounds like they may be starting to be compromised. I have i2p mail. You can probably use that. Just forensic analysis is cheaper and easier to find out where you are from if you use the i2p mail. I don&#039;t trust any darknet service that would advise you from using tormail. I never missed an email yet. I do all my transactions with bitinstant through tormail.
