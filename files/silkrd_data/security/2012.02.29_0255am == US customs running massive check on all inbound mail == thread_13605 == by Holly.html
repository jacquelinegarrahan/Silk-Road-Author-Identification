				Just got this PM on the Farmers Market forum.... they seem to know what&#039;s good most of the time.<br /><br />&quot;Per direct Cross Pond shipping will be unavailable.<br /><br />Reason for this; US customs is running a massive total check on all inbound mail.<br /><br />Irish customs is active as well, Irish customers are strongly advised to use insurance.<br /><br />Fortunately we have learned lessons from the past so we are having not to much trouble and are able to revert you to our local vendors who still bet 100%.<br /><br />outbound mail is untouched so Europeans can still order with stateside vendors although not advised.<br /><br /><br />If you are a stateside customer and have a pending order or resend with a European vendor please contact Keysh with your order# to work out a credit to use with our stateside vendors.<br /><br />Until further notice no cross pond shipping.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Adam<br /><br />&quot;

				I&#039;m sure they will be focusing what ever efforts they have on parcels, anyway.&nbsp; If vendors are shipping lettermail spec I wouldn&#039;t think much will be affected.&nbsp; Good luck with those 2.2 billion packages a year, guys ;)

				As of when is this effective? I just received an order yesterday from the EU with no problem, just took a little longer than a week. Clever and discreet shipping methods however. <br /><br />Edit: Question, do you think this applies to CAN as well or just across the pond?

				It&#039;s pretty obvious they have been doing this for a while... Considering that they mainly deal with weed products its pretty dumb to try to import that through customs. Other shit can still pass though no problem.

				The US has 50 million pieces of inbound international mail per day.<br /><br />PER DAY.<br /><br />They can&#039;t/won&#039;t ever be able to check it all.<br /><br />I worked in shipping in the UK and we get nearly as much as the US, they simply don&#039;t have the manpower to check it all here or in the US<br /><br />Australia is the only place that nuts, because 1) they have a small population and 2) shipping there is so expensive they only have a tiny fraction of what the UK and US do.

				probably operation pangea four or five or whatever number they are on now. Every now and then customs goes into over drive for a few days, usually international with interpol coordination. I think they have been doing it once or twice a year for the past few years. It is primarily aimed at counterfeit pharmaceuticals, but they always end up intercepting all kinds of crazy shit. No idea if this is what is happening, but Pangea operations usually coincide with a major increase in customs and USPI mail checking that lasts for about a week. <br /><br />http://www.ukmedix.com/impotence/interpol_operation_pangea_iv_leads_to_arrests_and_seizures6153.cfm<br /><br />

				Ive received a couple of packages from across the pond in the last two weeks. What i did notice is that they punched a tiny hole at the top. I assume that this is to help with their digital sniffers. I saw a thing on tv about how customs are using digital sniffers instead of dogs. they said that they are much more reliable and dont have to take them poop.. <br /><br />Seriously though. if its packaged well and is vacuum sealed I would manage it would be ok (as long as its not a smelly substance like pot)..

				The original idea of interception detection chips came from a vendor on OVDB. These chips would have RFID UARTs, RAM, ROM/NVRAM, and at a minimum a photoresistor/photovoltaic cell. When a vendor&#039;s making their pack, they&#039;d throw this chip under the outermost layer, seal up the package, then program it wirelessly with an integer of their choice which they&#039;d then send to the customer. The chip would use the secret integer and the value of epoch at the current time in combination with some hash algorithm to generate a string with a predictable value which would then be broadcast in response to an interrogation with another preprogrammed secret string (kind of like port knocking). If LE intercepts the package and opens it up, the chip (sensing this via the photoresistor) would wipe the secret integer from its memory, throwing off the value of the string that it&#039;s transmitting. When the customer receives the pack via mail or GPS dead drop or whatever, they can simply aim their RFID gun at the pack and send the interrogation string. If the response is an expected value depending on the time of day the pack hasn&#039;t been opened, if not the pack has been intercepted and can be either abandoned at the drop or have the delivery refused. You can add stuff like oxygen/NMR/x-ray sensors in addition to the light sensor for maximum measurement intelligence.<br /><br />I should add this probably wouldn&#039;t be used for SR as the chip would cost $10 or so to fab plus $20 (?) in parts. It&#039;s more for the vendors who vend to the vendors, and are slanging stuff like keys of molly/cocaine as opposed to LSD crystals. ;-)<br /><br />I feel we&#039;re really on the brink of using technology and cryptoanarchy to blow the arms race between us and the feds wide open, somebody needs to do this soon so why not me?

I thought about using lambda sensors since ene had tossed around that idea but they&#039;re very expensive (go to mouser.com and search for part number 785-GMS10RVS). Barometers were the next idea I came up with, you can throw them inside the outermost layer of sealing and when the pressure goes above say 7.5 kPa, you have a confirmed interception. Unfortunately the cheapest barometers (like http://cache.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/data_sheet/MPL115A1.pdf which is $1.50 ish) are SMD chips and since the plan is to have vendors build these themselves I don&#039;t think that&#039;ll work since most vendors won&#039;t have reflow ovens lying around. :-P The through hole chips I was looking at cost $15 or so. wrt x-rays I&#039;m gonna have to find out how much things like http://jp.hamamatsu.com/products/x-ray/pd181/index_en.html cost but &quot;contact us for pricing&quot; is never a good sign.

				QTC what are the issues with measuring electrical resistance of the package? I really know little about this. I told them photovoltaic cells are the suggested technique but they seem pretty sure that electrical resistance is a better technique since it avoids the risk of dark rooms. I will pass on any flaws with using electrical resistance and see what they have to say about it.

				Also allow me to make some suggestions from an area I do have a limited amount of expertise in (measuring electrical resistance not being one of these areas). Also will post some &#039;open research&#039; questions.<br /><br />First, is RFID the best transmission technology? Battery powered RFID can transmit up to 100 feet away I believe. It is certainly not going to work if we use RFID that is not battery powered as transmission distance will not be far enough to get a reading. Let&#039;s think of other transmission technologies that we could use. One idea I just had is using GSM chips. I know some leet carders use skimmers that text the card data to a phone, so they only need to worry about installation of the skimmer and not pick up. Perhaps we could also use GSM chips and have the state signal sent to a predetermined phone number. This would allow for detection of interception from a tremendous distance, but would also require the package to be in an area with reception. Could even have it send the signal via cellular network to a VOIP number that is accessed anonymously or something. This also has the added advantage of the vendor and customer both being able to check for interception, as a physical presence near the package will not be required. <br /><br />Second, what sensors can we use? The first suggestion by Enelysion was to use photovoltaic cells that trigger when light hits them (thus when the package is opened, we would assume). A limitation of this is the potential for packages to be opened in dark rooms. Things we need to take into consideration include ease of creating the product, ease of anonymously obtaining the required components, size of the components (we want these to be as small as possible), cost of the components (the cheaper the better, although for huge bulk orders cost will be less of a consideration), etc. One potential technique someone who is working on a design for these mentioned is measuring the electrical resistance of the packaging material, you seem to think this is a bad idea and I would love to hear why so I can forward the information on. Other potential sensors include x-ray, infra-red, etc. These would offer the advantage of being able to determine if a package was scanned at all, although the primary thing we are concerned with is if the package was opened. Another potential thing that has been mentioned is the use of oxygen detectors with the chip being vac sealed with the drug shipment.<br /><br />As far as what is broadcast, I propose that we use a PRNG with a secret seed that is set by the sender after the package is created (wirelessly set). The chip then begins to run the PRNG and broadcasts its current state every certain amount of time, after a timer runs out. The output of the PRNG will either be a 1 or a 0, and this is determined by the seed. Someone who knows the seed will be able to determine the state of the PRNG out to an arbitary bit length. Someone who does not know the seed will have a fifty fifty chance of being able to mimic its resulting output for a given broadcast (either 1 or 0). The person the pack is sent to can measure the output of the PRNG (via the transmission system we go with) and compare it to what the output of the PRNG should be (which they can determine since the sender of the pack sends them the seed via asymmetric encryption). If it matches up for enough broadcasts, it can be determined that the seed is still present in the volatile memory. If it doesn&#039;t broadcast or the broadcast does not match up with what the seed should produce, interception (or malfunction) can safely be assumed. <br /><br />I propose that the person getting the pack is not required to broadcast to it, as they could very well compromise their position by doing so. The chip should instead be on a timer and set to broadcast after a set amount of time (when it is assumed to be in the box waiting for pick up). The chip can not broadcast while it is in transit or else the attacker can start to look for broadcasting packages and the chip will turn into a beacon. However, I am fairly certain that there are broadcasting mechanisms that attempt to hide the signal that is broadcast from someone who does not have knowledge about the parameters of the broadcast, I am not an expert on wireless transmission but I have friends who are I will ask them more about this. It may be feasible to have a hidden broadcast that is difficult for a third party to detect even if they are looking for it, although again I am not certain if we will be able to implement such a sophisticated system with our chips. LPI is one such system for signal transmission with low risk of detection, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_probability_of_intercept_radar . <br /><br />Then we need a mechanism in place to quickly wipe the volatile memory after one of the sensors is triggered, or else customs may be able to flash freeze it and obtain the seed. Cutting power after one of the sensors is triggered may not be enough.<br /><br />Design goals should be to make the chip as fully features as possible while also making it as cheap and easy to produce as possible, and perhaps most important as small and discreet as possible. <br /><br />Please weigh in everyone who has any expertise relating to any of the areas involved with this, or anyone who has comments opinions questions or suggestions. Let&#039;s get this shit done! Using these in addition to fake ID boxes will make importing large bulk far safer, as we will always be able to determine when an interception has taken place prior to attempting pick up.

				Hmm, let me tell you that I&#039;m not an authority on the US postal or legal systems, just have a hard time envisioning the practical application of such an RFID thing...<br />Haven&#039;t we established that...?<br />a) small amounts of drugs should not warrant a controlled delivery and thus the chip isn&#039;t worthwile<br />b) bulk shipments (wherever the line is drawn) that end up being seized have a high chance for an orchestrated controlled delivery including warrants obtained beforehand (I believe that&#039;s what the postal intern had to say in his thread). Too many people will go apeshit about a possible incoming CD and how to deny but will forget about the few grams of weed stashed in the house (strong circumstantial evidence) or worse, unencrypted PCs (please everybody, encrypt asap, it&#039;s so easy yet powerful!). <br />Anyway, assuming everything is clean and no search warrant granted, you must expect them to have uncovered your device and be on the lookout for ANY suspicious activity. Pointing an RFID gun at your parcel (as someone suggested above) will not exactly be to your advantage ^^. <br />Perhaps it&#039;s doable in a practical way and I&#039;m just completely missing it so...

				For one it is dumb to assume you wont be raided and sent to pound me in the ass prison for a small personal use interception, people go to prison for personal use amounts of drugs on a regular basis and you are not special just because you get your drugs shipped to you.<br /><br />Second of all, it would be primarily for importers.

				wouldn&#039;t allowing such a device to connect to a cellular network or some other form of long distance communication be an absolute necessity? an otherwise limited range of 100 ft wouldn&#039;t do that much good if the package gets intercepted at customs, where it could be removed. although if that were to happen, the shear lack of a signal broadcasting could itself be the red flag? <br /><br />if it were intercepted you&#039;d also have to assume they would very quickly possibly modify and use the technology to their advantage, no? like making it broadcast a false signal to fool the otherwise brave soul? or am i missing something here? absolutely love the concept tho! ;)

I really know little about this. I told them photovoltaic cells are the suggested technique but they seem pretty sure that electrical resistance is a better technique since it avoids the risk of dark rooms. I will pass on any flaws with using electrical resistance and see what they have to say about it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First of all you&#039;d need to measure the resistance across various points of the inside of the package since it may be ripped open at an arbitrary location. This means you&#039;d have leads and wires lying all over the inside of the pack, this would be very easy to dislodge during shipping and would make actually packing the pack a pain in the ass. More thoughts... smd/through hole ohmmeters aren&#039;t exactly cheap... and the biggest obstacle is that cardboard has an insanely high resistivity! It&#039;s rho value is approximately ten million to one hundred million ohms * centimeters, which means that cardboard is basically an open circuit. I see no possible way to measure the resistance of the box and get a meaningful value in return.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13605.msg134190#msg134190">Quote from: kmfkewm on March 02, 2012, 10:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First, is RFID the best transmission technology?

The chip then begins to run the PRNG and broadcasts its current state every certain amount of time, after a timer runs out. The output of the PRNG will either be a 1 or a 0, and this is determined by the seed. Someone who knows the seed will be able to determine the state of the PRNG out to an arbitary bit length. Someone who does not know the seed will have a fifty fifty chance of being able to mimic its resulting output for a given broadcast (either 1 or 0). The person the pack is sent to can measure the output of the PRNG (via the transmission system we go with) and compare it to what the output of the PRNG should be (which they can determine since the sender of the pack sends them the seed via asymmetric encryption). If it matches up for enough broadcasts, it can be determined that the seed is still present in the volatile memory. If it doesn&#039;t broadcast or the broadcast does not match up with what the seed should produce, interception (or malfunction) can safely be assumed.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I like this idea better than mine<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I propose that the person getting the pack is not required to broadcast to it, as they could very well compromise their position by doing so.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you worried about LE waiting at the drop point with radio analysis equipment?

It could start broadcasting when it&#039;s hung up in customs or something... this would be easily detectable and could possibly lead to staking out the delivery location with radio analysis equipment. I think this presents a lot of dangers compared with requiring a secret interrogation to return a broadcast. Maybe an idea to consider is that one interrogation will result in 20 outputs of the PRNG or something, instead of just one. This would result in a (1/2)^20 chance that the transmission could be replicated which is... astronomically low. :-p<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Then we need a mechanism in place to quickly wipe the volatile memory after one of the sensors is triggered, or else customs may be able to flash freeze it and obtain the seed.

				If someone is using an RFID with &quot;resistance&quot; then I&#039;d bet they&#039;re using a simple continuity sensor.&nbsp; They&#039;re simply looking for a trace or a small wire across the seam of the box to break.&nbsp; This is the simplest and easiest implementation of a wireless means of detecting the opening of a package.<br /><br />There&#039;s a couple vendors already producing these.&nbsp; Google &quot;RFID Crack Detector&quot; and you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; There are passive options out there that are easy to conceal.<br /><br />Wires across the seams will show up on X-ray and might set off some red flags.....
