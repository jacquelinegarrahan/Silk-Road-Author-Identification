				Hey Everybody!<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be making my first purchase on SR soon.&nbsp; I have not made a purchase before so I wanted to run my set-up past a few people before I go ahead and do this.<br /><br />Firstly, I will be getting my BTC by using Mt Gox and BitInstant.&nbsp; I have borrowed and reformatted a laptop with which to make the purchase.&nbsp; I will be spoofing the MAC and hopping onto someone&#039;s unsecured wireless network.&nbsp; I will then create a disposable email account and register for Mt Gox.&nbsp; At this point I will hop back on Tor and use a Tormail to set up a BitInstant invoice for the amount of BTC.&nbsp; I&#039;m having a friend take the BitInstant invoice into a bank and will make the deposit.&nbsp; After the BTCs are in my Mt Gox I will just transfer them through a few insta-wallets and possibly BitLaundry before transferring to SR.&nbsp; Is there a safer way for me to acquire BTC?<br /><br />My main concern is with receiving the package.&nbsp; I will be ordering very small amounts (under 5gs) and the only place I have to ship is my own residence.&nbsp; I am trying to decide whether I should ship to my real name or if I should use the name of a previous resident.&nbsp; I still receive regular mail from 2 or 3 previous residents and am considering using the exact spelling and formatting as one of these letters.&nbsp; Is there a reason why shipping to my real name would be better or should I just use the name of the previous resident?<br /><br />I appreciate the feedback very much!<br /><br />tl;dr Would it be better to ship using my real name or the exact spelling and formatting of mail from a previous resident that still comes regularly?

				The first part of you reasoning sounds good.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about the mac spoofing with MtGox but I don&#039;t think it will be a problem.&nbsp; Another way would be getting moneypak and getting them from a vendor on here (MAKE SURE TO READ THE FORUM first to make sure they aren&#039;t scammers).<br /><br />If you are still receiving mail with other peoples names on it you could take the chance but I wouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; There could be a chance they have their mail forwarded and the mail you are getting isn&#039;t for some reason.&nbsp; You wouldn&#039;t want to waste your coin.&nbsp; Most of the posts here on the forums say to use your real name so the parcel doesn&#039;t get flagged.&nbsp; I usually use a shortened version but that is just my preference.&nbsp;
