				I am currently renting a PO Box in my city under my name to ship stuff to. I bought from Farmer&#039;s Market shortly before it was busted, has already been several months. I ordered some hash and acid, the hash got here but the acid was seized. Just Recently I checked my box and there was a letter from the department of justice, with the official post markings and everything... I was like hmmm I wonder what this is... because it&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve ordered from here. That LSD I never got stuck out in my mind. The letter reads like this<br /><br />Dear X XXXX: (this was the name I used to ship. not x&#039;s)<br /><br />You are receiving this letter because your name and/or address has been identified with the purchases of controlled substances online, which may be punishable by imprisonment under Federal law Title 21 U.S.C. 841 and 21 U.S.C. 844. These controlled substances were often shipped from foreign countries. With limited exception, it is a felony to import controlled substances into the United States under Title 21 U.S.C. 952. The Drug Enforcement Administration is actively and aggressively targeting these online illicit websites for prosecution.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this letter or have information to provide about illegal online websites, please call the Drug Enforcement Administration at (###) ###-####.<br /><br />Very Truly yours,<br /><br />ANDRE BIROTTE JR.<br />United States Attorney<br /><br />KEVIN S. ROSENBERG<br />Assistant United States Attorney&quot;<br /><br />should I be worried at all? I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be a good idea to ship any more contraband to that particular address. The letter didn&#039;t actually say they were going to do anything, probably just to serve as a warning.

				Sounds similar to the many letters I got from my Internet Service Provider within the past 6 years in reference to the downloading of certain hit movies such as Prometheus, Bourne Supremacy, and The Matrix.&nbsp; There was some mention about copyright infringement, prosecution, federal this and that, blah blah blah... But where are these allegedly downloaded movies now?&nbsp; As in your case, where are the goodies now?&nbsp; That&#039;s the question that must be answered before they can lock you up with all of those other dangerous people.&nbsp; Those letters make great packaging material after you run it through the shredder or they can be useful in sparking up that fireplace for a nice toasty afternoon nap.
