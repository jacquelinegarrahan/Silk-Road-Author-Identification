				Read the disclaimer!<br /><br />Safenet, is a safe way for the agency&#039;s to keep a eye on you.<br /><br />They will read the content of your mail and inform the agency&#039;s.<br /><br />What else can you expect from Israel...<br /><br />Hide my ass can only receave, and anonymouse can only send email.<br /><br />When you are behind a tornetwork and use proxy&#039;s you can make anonymous some accounts.<br /><br />Never enter these secret mailaccounts without tor, so when your real ipaddress is showing.<br /><br />Using gpg will let the agency left in the dark, about the content.<br /><br />When you use hidemyass, use the account just for the time you will need it.<br /><br />So the account and message will be destroyed, after 1 day or 7 days.<br /><br />Big files can be uploaded with the same safety features, or even more.<br /><br />You can exclude every country, except the country of the receiver.<br /><br />Fill in the amount of times the file can be downloaded (just once) so it will selfdestruct after the download.<br /><br />A site as privnote will share the same destiny as tormail, and will be copromised some day too.<br />Revealing every ones address, who did not use gpg.<br /><br />Hide my ass or anonymouse will give data too, if they have it and can, but with a court order.<br />They will have to, or they will be shutt down completely.<br /><br />That&#039;s why a change of private keys is a must. If L.E. has your gpg- encrypted mail, they will try discover the ipaddress. Hack the computer to try to find the private key.<br />Bruteforce cracking the private key is no option for the agency&#039;s.<br /><br />The list the Topic Starter gave, is just bullocks.<br />Not safe.<br />Nothing safer then a ordinary gmail-account of Sarah Palin.<br /><br />No email site is safe, not one! Not ever!<br />Always use gpg<br />Always use TOR.<br />Always TAILS.<br /><br />Nothing more you could have done if something goes wrong.<br /><br />Without the use of TOR and gpg, the use of the email of HMA and anonymouse is NOT safe either.

				Don&#039;t use any email service that is based in the US, even if they claim privacy. Just look at what happened to LavaBit.<br /><br />Use an email service in a foreign country, that offers web-mail that doesn&#039;t require javascript (some email providers use the squirrel mail interface for webmail which doesn&#039;t use javascript. Always use TOR to access the email account, and use GPG/PGP to encrypt everything.<br /><br />Your actually probably better off setting up TorChat, or using the private message features on SR or the forums *WITH* PGP.<br /><br />The Silk Road chat room is also a good place to meet, it&#039;s an IRC server on the onion network so it&#039;s anonymous and encrypted, plus you can add OTR for private chats to add an extra layer of encryption/security.
