				I hear the you can get them by giving blow-jobs in public toilets with the BTC logo on..... :P<br /><br />Joking man, just having fun with you. <br /><br />If you want to pay cash then you should speak to V1ad1mir who does a CIM-for-BTC service. :)<br /><br />And no LE don&#039;t monitor Sang per se but Sang will alert them if your account is considered to have any irregularities that you can&#039;t confirm with them. Your best bet is to use Sang maybe once-twice a month. Exactly how many do you actually want to buy?

				Intersango definitely. I use them all the time and they&#039;re great. <br /><br />I had one single issue a few weeks back and the director of the company emailed me and fixed it in about 30 mins at something stupid like half 4 in the morning which impressed me. (My bank transfer wasn&#039;t showing, which turned out to be Metro Bank&#039;s fault anyway).<br /><br />There are a few credit card to BTC sites around, but so far I&#039;ve found them all to be unreliable or scams. I was considering making one myself but the card handlers (Visa / Mastercard) don&#039;t want anything to do with you as soon as they find out what you&#039;re doing.
