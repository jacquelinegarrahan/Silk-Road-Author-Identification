				Was thinking about setting up a safe drop at a PO box.<br />Do they scan your ID<br />What do they keep on file<br />what happens if the package is too big for the box?

				if its too big they will hold it. I use the biggest one. dont think they scan ids. 24 hour access is best and so is having them sign for you.

				I&#039;ve gotten private mail boxes before and they have always scanned my identification information to keep in a file. There are ways to make this not a big deal but you can probably brainstorm those for yourself.

				When I had a PO box at the UPS store they scanned and kept my signature on file for having them sing for boxes for me. Unless you kinda know the clerk operating the desk at the time it is kind of an issue due to the fact they can loose their job over now scanning the ID for UPS. I knew the person at UPS and didn&#039;t have a scanned ID for a week. Yeah you can use houses for sell but that always increases failure rate.
