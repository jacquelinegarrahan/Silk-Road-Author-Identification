				Hey,<br /><br />I used it once. Even though the transaction itself was easy and fast, it&#039;s total bullshit, because from VirWox you can only buy whole Bitcoins (at least it was like that a year ago).<br />So if you let&#039;s say buy 10k linden dollars for your money, and 1 btc is worth 4k linden dollars, you can only buy 2 bitcoins and you are going to sit on the rest of your linden dollars. (The numbers are probably totally wrong, but you should get the problem).<br /><br />cheers

				its ok!<br /><br />they no longer require to transfer into whole BTC!<br /><br />the main issue is the fees and restricted deposits **BUT** these do relax and get much better the more you use the service.<br /><br />also the best way to make a transfer is to use the &#039;limit price&#039; rather then &#039;market price&#039; in order to get preferable exchange rates.

				i also forgot to mention - the first transaction or two will need to be authorised manually, so expect to wait 48 hours before you get your BTC! after that though its a very fast and efficient service that gets cheaper the longer you use it.

				The transactions fees are a pain in the ass....you get dinged 4 times I think:&nbsp; 1. Fee from Depositing Paypal $$ into your Virwox account 2. Transaction fee exchanging $$ into Linden Dollars&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Transaction fee exchanging Linden Dollars into BTC&nbsp; 4. Finally, a .01 BTC fee to Virwox when you withdraw your Bitcoins to your SR wallet<br /><br />I haven&#039;t added up all of that yet, but I should...it&#039;s probably 10-12%&nbsp; <br /><br />Your first two Virwox withdrawals are subject to a 48 hour manual verification hold which is really annoying so plan ahead before ordering .....<br /><br />Other than those annoyances, I find it very fast...very convenient, and it has been the only BTC exchange I&#039;ve used.....(the convenience factor may justify the high transaction fees.)<br /><br />Cheers...... 8)

				I know it&#039;s ridiculous.&nbsp; &nbsp;-Supposedly- Linden dollars are used in some virtual &quot;Sim-City&quot; like video game for people with too much time on their hands.&nbsp; Allegedly Linden Dollars predated the Bitcoin as currency in some virtual world these people live in b/c their own lives are pathetically banal.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know........&quot;Second Life&quot; they call it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond my scope, I guess.&nbsp; Whatever it is, the creators of &quot;Second Life&quot; figured out a way to make some extra money off people needing Bitcoins to get to their own separate, virtual world here on Silk Road .......heh.&nbsp; I guess they are the smart ones....&nbsp; &nbsp;::)
