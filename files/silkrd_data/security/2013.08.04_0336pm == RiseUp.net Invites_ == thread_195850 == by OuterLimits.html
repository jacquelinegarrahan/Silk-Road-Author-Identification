				Don&#039;t use riseup, it&#039;s a US server that&#039;s already been seized a few times and is heavily watched by FBI looking for eco terriblists. It also puts activists at risks when drug dealers are using it. If they find out you&#039;re using it for anything that doesn&#039;t agree with their politics they will cancel your account too.<br /><br />Plenty of other options exist, hell even privatdemail.net in Egypt would be better.

It&#039;s also policed by Riseup activists who will nuke your account the moment somebody snitches you&#039;re using it for the dope game.

				At least the FBI returned it! https://mayfirst.org/fbi-returns-server (hilarious surveillance video included)<br /><br />The FBI obtained a warrant for that server specifically because a bomb threat email exited through the email mixer on that server. Nothing about that tells me that Riseup was specifically targeted. Hell, Riseup wasn&#039;t even running anything on that server themselves, they were just providing a colo. AFAIK, no other Riseup servers have ever been seized.<br /><br />Riseup does provide tech services for political dissident types, including a donation-based VPN service that provides public IP addresses and doesn&#039;t keep connection/traffic logs. Of course, the NSA keeps all traffic logs so every VPN service is a somewhat thin layer of protection from them. I personally trust Riseup far more than the average random VPN service (like the HideMyAss debacle - http://falkvinge.net/2011/09/27/never-trust-a-vpn-provider-that-doesnt-accept-bitcoin/).<br /><br />As far as email goes, all emails are swept up no matter whether they&#039;re sent from your basement server or Riseup. Use strong encryption if you want to keep it private.

				So we can&#039;t use tormail, riseup, hushmail, I have been told safemail is owned by the people who own riseup wouldn&#039;t that make it no go as well?, countermail.&nbsp; &nbsp; So what else does that leave to try?&nbsp; personal vps paid in bitcoin with a private email?
