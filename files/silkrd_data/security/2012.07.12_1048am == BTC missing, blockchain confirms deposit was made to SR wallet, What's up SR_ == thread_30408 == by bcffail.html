				OK, so far I never had an issue when I tumbled my btc through bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion). <br />But now it&#039;s been FAR too long for the transfer. I double checked the btc address I sent to, it&#039;s correct. <br /><br />Can anyone maybe tell me how I can check what has gone wrong? I&#039;m quite pisssed at myself atm because I&#039;ve never read up on the btc system as I never had any problems. <br />Some help would be much appreciated!

				I&#039;m sorry that I can&#039;t help you out at all. But I can offer you a *bit* of consolation...lots of people in the past day or so have been having difficulties getting their BTCs into their SR wallet. I made a transaction yesterday at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, and it still hasn&#039;t arrived in my account. I&#039;m hoping that it&#039;s just a hiccup in the system and can be fixed by SR support (hopefully). I know they are probably being flooded with emails about this right now, so I&#039;m not sure if it will be handled in a timely manner. <br /><br />Best of luck to you though! Hopefully we will all be getting our BTCs soon!

				To see whether it&#039;s bitcoin fog&#039;s fault or something else, go to blockchain.info and put in your SR address in the space in the upper right hand corner (search). If nothing has gone through, it will say 0 transactions, and you can be fairly sure it&#039;s bitcoin fog&#039;s doing. If however it says so many BTCs and the size of each deposit and the number of confirmations, then you will know it&#039;s SR&#039;s problem (and YOURS, too).<br /><br />Darkwave

				Thank you for the hint at the blockchain. It says my btc were deposited into my SR wallet. So it&#039;s NOT bitcoinfog&#039;s fault. I hope SR fixes this, a lot of people are waiting for a lot of money here :( No reply from support after the generic &quot;wait&quot; message, either. How worried should we be?&nbsp; :-\

				Sorry to hear about your guys transactions. On a positive note, I was able to deposit a few btc into my account in about 2 hours. Good luck<br />
