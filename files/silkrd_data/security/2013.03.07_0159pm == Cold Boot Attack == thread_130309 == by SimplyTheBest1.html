				WTF... &quot;a useful tool for law enforcement?&quot;&nbsp; Are they insane?&nbsp; Law enforcement buy devices that rip the entire contents of the phone in like, 5 minutes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think a fucking PIN lock is going to keep them out.<br /><br />This entire article confuses me.&nbsp; It confuses me because this is going to vary wildly by manufacturer, Android version, ROM installed, etc., etc., etc..

				One thing is for sure, the local police department doesn&#039;t have the resources to do this.&nbsp; Maybe if its like Bin Laden or something . .. <br /><br />This could work two ways, you could also load a phone with fake data and get &#039;caught&#039; with it.&nbsp; They would yank the fake data and start red herring their way to nowhere... Its a good thing actually ..&nbsp; If they go through all that work to get in, they will surely think the data is legit on it.&nbsp; They could incriminate themselves and botch an investigation with this fake data leading them to innocent people muuhooohhaaa&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Jeese, the last few busts around my place were all taken from one asshole&#039;s cel phone records.&nbsp; They nabbed about 7 people all from one cel phone.&nbsp; Previous txt messages did them in.&nbsp; Warrants were issued based on that data alone.

Why bother with coldboot attack ?<br /><br />There is softwares, toolkits and other simple tools that can do deeps forensics analysis of any given standard android devices. Probably just as easy on Apple devices too.<br /><br />The cold boot attack is for me like a &quot;last resort&quot; way to gather some useful data. Most of the time the SD/card flash memory will already provides tons of information on it&#039;s own.

				Cold booting is dumb. If anyone has access to your phone/computer for the time that a CBA takes, you might as well considered yourself fucked no matter what

What&#039;s your opinion?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I actually asked a forensics expert about this. He said that CBA doesn&#039;t work against DDR3 unless the memory is frozen. Unlike DDR2 etc DDR3 has its state decay very rapidly, so you cannot quickly restart the machine and boot up into a forensics live OS, or remove the RAM and put it into a forensics laptop. But the rate of its state decay is still slowed by freezing it, so provided you freeze it the attack is still feasible. CBA doesn&#039;t always inherently involve freezing the RAM, but in cases where the RAM is frozen it is still applicable to DDR3.
