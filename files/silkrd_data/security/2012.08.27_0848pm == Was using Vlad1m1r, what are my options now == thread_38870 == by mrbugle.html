				Can&#039;t you just buy bitoins on Mt. Gox using your real account and pass them through a few wallets?

				Buy BTC through intersango or MTGOX (it looks like intersango arent going to be taking GBP soon; I have used them a while, and when they worked (nearly always)they were great&nbsp; but when they had their problems your money would be held up weeks!) MtGOX take a day or two to register deposits but are otherwise reliable ( I believe if you send them photo and utility bills they process more or less instantly. Even though I intellectually know this is no more an exposure than giving them my bank details, I just don&#039;t want to!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Transfer bitcoins to a tumbler such as bitcoin fog. I don&#039;t think simply using a chain of wallets, even accessed through Tor, makes you theoretically untraceable.<br />If you do this then all you are guilty of is buying BTC.<br /><br />My thoughts on this have always been, if I get caught it&nbsp; will be through discovery of a package at customs or in mail. I cant see LE wasting their valuble intelligence infrastructure on tracing my smalltime drug deals through cyberspace. I hope and assume that small amounts I buy wouldnt cause any further action than&nbsp; confiscation. Even if they access my financial records and my IP shows I <br />used Tor? It&#039;s still insufficint to charge I think. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The only way LE will get enough evidence to charge is if you incriminate yourself when talking to them.<br />I personally have felt comfortable using my Bank to pay exchanges for BTC as I just can&#039;t see LE going into this much trouble over finding a small personal amount. They might attempt to interview me and see if they could trick or scare me into revealing too much. Which is why I would say nothing except &quot; Am I under arrest? where is my legal representative&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also feel like it would be overkill to try and be super secure at that end, as when I receive my package I don&#039;t do the &quot;return to sender&quot; and leave untouched shit. I tear open the package like a rabid dog and shove fistfuls of drugs into my face. If the police were to knock at this point they would find me looking like Rik Mayall attempting suicide in the young ones ( &quot;all the punks and skins and dreads will say the people&#039;s poet is dead&quot;)<br />This will render my clever security precautions irrelevant!<br /><br />Well, anyway, that&#039;s my somewhat reckless advice. <br /><br /><br />HOWEVER I do have a large caveat. I and lots of other small time buyers tend to rely on being to small for LE to bother with. This is probably true, drug police usually want to move UP the chain of supply. But if they come under pressure from media and/or government to do something about SR, and are unable to get a finger hold on vendors ( due to the complexity of setting up an attack on a vendor; staking out mailboxes etc) I could see them deciding to sweep up the low hanging fruit of careless buyers. Probably the easiest way to do this would be harvesting addresses through fake vendor accounts, then intercepting packages sent to those addresses.<br />Call in recipients and lean on them, hoping that they can be intimidated into incriminating themselves.<br /><br />Well, that&#039;s why I don&#039;t worry too much about using my bank account. I am in the UK and I already have a criminal record so I don&#039;t feel the stakes are too high. You have to decide for yourself really.<br /><br /><br />By the wasy, whats gone on with Vlad? Hope things haven&#039;t gone tits up for him

				Bitcoin OTC looks interesting.... A little daunting to the non techy; but I guess with a bit of investigation it&#039;s simpler than it looks. <br />Not read Vlad thread yet....I&#039;ll have a look.

				MtGox for me, just need to plan ahead. Sure as eggs are eggs come Thursday night I&#039;ll be wanting to buy for the weekend so always top up Tuesday morning regardless of whether I think I will need them or not. Nor in the least parandoid about sending from my account to Barclays, I konw the government wants to screw us as much as possible but if it was going after SR I imagine they&#039;&#039;d aim at the top or at least the vendors. Although it is possible they take the attitude we make people too parandoid to use but then mtrgox or intersango would allow some over the counter cash method to pay. I know Liberty Reserve used to do this (possibly still do) where you pay money UKCash or something send them a long number and they give you LR currency. Or Moneygram or WU,<br /><br />That&#039;s why I think government won&#039;t go after me (touch wood&nbsp; a million times) cause I&#039;m a tiny fish and it won&#039;t achieve anything. Shit, now I&#039;m panicking, wasteful crap that leads nowhere sounds just like the thing this government would do.<br /><br />EDIT: Should have read hungry ghost few posts up first, explains it far better than I do. My excuse if ever got caught with package would always be &#039;anyone could send that, ex-wife, someone sacked at work, who knows. If I send one to 10 Downing St would you treat him the same?;<br /><br />Doubt it would work but I can&#039;t really see firm evidence, need to open up, put a little camera in, then watch me, and again I&#039;m far too small a fish, not even a tadpole&#039; to warrant that.

				How safe is this method?<br /><br />Western union&nbsp; to liberty reserve to bitcoin.<br />The bitcoin then sent to bitfog and then on to silk road.

				Just want to reiterate I&#039;m a reckless idiot and don&#039;t hasve any expertise; I don&#039;t want anyone getting into trouble cause of my advice! Also if you do get caught don&#039;t make excuses inviolving your ex wife sacked employees etc. The police will mither and ask and pull at your story until you slip up. Say fuck all. Ask to speak to solicitor. I know in the UK there&#039;s this &quot; anything you fail to mention now you later rely on in court&quot; shit but in nearly all cases it&#039;s not going to harm you. If all the police have is a package with your name on and some evidence you bought bitcoins, I doubt they can charge. But whether they can or not, nothing you say can improve things.Remember the police already KNOW you did it. They seriously don&#039;t think this packagerr of drugs is a malicious attempt to harm your reputastion! They just want you to slip up in a lie then they can pressure you into confession.<br />Note once again I am not a lawyer and this is just my thoughts on the matter

				Good advice again hungry ghost, no comment is always the way to go. I&#039;ve been looking at couple sites you can use paypal to buy liberty reserve (If you verify which may put a lot of people off) and then from mtgox / intersango it&#039;s instant transfer&nbsp; from LR to BTC. Still just looking into it.<br /><br />BY the way, how are the WU fees now? NOtice a few offer that option in place of Paypal and probably not have be verified. Remember when I used it before it was very expensive to use , like $20 to send $200.
