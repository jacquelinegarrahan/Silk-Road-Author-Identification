				I just did a trans through Bit Instant at a 7-11.<br /><br />I got the email saying that my transaction was completed successfully.&nbsp; I have downloaded Bit Coin Wallet from the weusecoins site as I saw in a FAQ here on these forums.<br /><br />When I did the thing with Bit Instant I selected the option transfer to a Bit Coin address and I checked ten times that I used the correct one that is listed under &quot;receive coins&quot; on my Bit coin wallet app.<br /><br />But my Bit Coins are not there yet?&nbsp; It still says 0 and there is nothing under trans history still.<br /><br />this may not matter but at the bottom of the Bit coin wallet app it has a green bar that says Synchronizing with network 10*** blocks remaining.&nbsp; Do I have to wait for this to finish?<br /><br />Any help you guys can provide is greatly appreciated.<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				On it&#039;s first run, a bitcoin wallet will download every single block on the chain from oldest to newest, so your coins won&#039;t appear until your wallet is 99.99% synchronized. Future transactions will appear much quicker since your wallet will only need to download the blocks added since your last synchronization.

				You could use something like multibit software, at multibit.org. Or an online wallet like blockchain.info so you don&#039;t have to download the entire blockchain. <br /><br />Multibit is smart enough to only download the chain from your first bitcoin address date. <br />And blockchain.info offers an entirely javascript based wallet.<br />

At least it works here, if your wallet is ancient then it&#039;d need to download the full thing.&nbsp; Or if you force it to reset from the start of time, it will. But it does allow partial block chains, which is nice to not have to store the block-chain from the age of dawn.
