				TorMail -- jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion -- might be something to check into.&nbsp; (Remeber to encrypt your messages if you&#039;d rather they not be readable by anyone other than the recipient.)

				+1 for TorMail. They even have instructions on how to set up Thunderbird with it using Tor as proxy.<br /><br />Also, get Enigmail for Thunderbird after you install GnuPG and you&#039;re golden :)

				thanks for those links Gall.&nbsp; Ok though so I think i set up a tormail and the thunderbird thing accordingly. but i changed the settings for thunderbird according to the directions after I created my account. Would that mess anything up? or should it still all work correctly? Is there any way I can find out? Almost there then I gotta get enigma set up.

When you were adding the account, you did see the IMAP option and the servers both IMAP and SMTP were gibrish right, aka: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion<br /><br />I tell you what, I&#039;ll PM you me tormail and PGP key and you shoot me an encrypted email with your key attached. this way you can test :) btw configured enigmail to include your PGP public key in outgoing emails.<br /><br />Gall

				I am new to tormail as well. I was hoping you could help me get this working as well.<br />My tormail address is boss@tormail.net i followed the tutorial with thunderbird but it says my username or password is incorrect. However i have logged into my account several times now and have sent and received messages so i&#039;m not sure what i&#039;m doing wrong. <br />I also would like help figuring out what my public key is, as well as how to use other peoples keys successfully as i don&#039;t understand where i actually use them.
