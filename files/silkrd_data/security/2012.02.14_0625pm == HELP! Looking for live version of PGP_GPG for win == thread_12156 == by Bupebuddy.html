				I am looking for a live version of PGP for windows that I can run from my flash drive just like everything else I use for SR.&nbsp; I prefer it to have a GUI but don&#039;t mind command line only.&nbsp; I appologize if this has been addressed in the passed.&nbsp; Even if it has please help in this thread or at least link me to a previous thread.&nbsp; I have used the search function with no luck.&nbsp; At this point I am downloading a portable version I think may work but until I actually install I am unable to comment.<br /><br />Here is the link to what I am currently downloading:<br /><br />http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/<br /><br />Any input is much appreciated!

				Portable PGP is a piece of shit because it uses the buggy bouncy castle implementation of PGP. gpg4usb (http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de) is much better.

				QTC - Thank you so much!&nbsp; You are a very intelligent person and I try to read as many threads as you make regarding security.&nbsp; It&#039;s no joke you know your shit and it is better to be safe than sorry.&nbsp; I like to think I have been up to date on my security but I had to have my whole system drive locked down with trucrypt and I don&#039;t like having to do that.&nbsp; At the moment my only access to the interwebz is through a phone tether only with windows without routing my phone.&nbsp; Problem is, it&#039;s a business phone and if I fuck up the rooting I don&#039;t know how I would explain it. <br /><br />My next step is to just run a VMware of Fedora or Ubuntu, haven&#039;t decided yet.&nbsp; Connect through windows and tunnel connection to the VM.&nbsp; But until I can get the downloads complete, I am just trying to make everything I need &quot;Live&quot; through windows.<br /><br />Thanks for the recommendation QTC.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t mind me PM&#039;ing you I will do so with a quick question here and there.

				You are welcome although I believe I have never started any threads on here. :) Feel free to PM me but I prefer to keep non-private stuff out in the open so somebody else may benefit.
