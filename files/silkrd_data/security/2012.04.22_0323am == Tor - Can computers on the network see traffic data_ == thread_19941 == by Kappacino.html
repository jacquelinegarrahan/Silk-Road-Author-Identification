				Can computers on the network see traffic data?<br />Well, with a WLAN network, you can see the data using wireshark, but TOR would be obfuscated I&#039;m guessing.<br />I haven&#039;t really researched it.

				because SR is a hidden service, your network traffic w/it never exits TOR network. It never hits an exit node. The exit node is the only node that processes non-obfuscated data. <br /><br />Sorry, I digress (tweaking a little bit). The answer to your most recent post is &quot;No. No one can see that you are browsing any site that ends in .onion.&quot;<br /><br />If you were using TOR to browse xhamster.com, then the machine that is operating as the exit node for that session would be able to determine that someone, somewhere, is browsing xhamster.com.

				Tor:<br /><br />sorry if this is not close enough to OP. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering, has Tor ever actually been &quot;Cracked&quot;? As in, has anyone, person, group gotten snagged, popped or whatever through solely the Tor network... has anyone been actually routed from being on Tor and being found to have participated in something less than legal, through tor, and been caught? <br /><br />Or is this yet to have happened? Or is this unknown? <br /><br />I know most here use multiple separations and programs and aids for evasion but what if someone used their home, PC, basically everything personal but only used them through tor? And I&#039;m not saying using easy usernames or identifying characters... <br /><br />Any knowledge or Tor breakdown?

				The Tor network is susceptible to many different attacks, this is especially true for location hidden services like SR. arma, the lead developer of Tor, will tell anybody willing to listen that hidden services are totally fucked. But at the same time I know of nobody who&#039;s been pwnt because Tor was pwnt, in every CP or carder bust I&#039;ve read discovery info for for example, people who used VPNs were caught but people who used Tor got away.

However, could the NSA completely fuck TOR and SSL encryption if they directed major resources to it? Of course.&nbsp;
