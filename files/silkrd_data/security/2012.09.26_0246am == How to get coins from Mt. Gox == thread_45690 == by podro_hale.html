However, as they are asking you to verify your identity it&#039;s likely you accessed Mt.Gox via TOR, which immediately flags your account and sets off their Anti Money Laundering / Know Your Customer procedures.<br /><br />Do not access your Mt.Gox account using TOR.<br /><br />If they&#039;re asking you for verification then the only way you&#039;re going to be able to get your money out is by verifying your identity. It may be possible to do this with fake documents, but I personally wouldn&#039;t go that route. If it were me, I would provide the required documents then launder the Bitcoin for an appropriate amount of time before spending them here, or else sell them to someone else via localbitcoins.com and buy more Bitcoin anonymously using a new account, ensuring never to access it via TOR or take any action that would cause the AML / KYC procedures to come into play. You need to research what these are; the information is available both here and on the clearnet.<br /><br />You can read about how to obtain Bitcoin anonymously here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.msg234943#msg234943<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				If I recall correctly, Mt. Gox has announced that they will cooperate with any law enforcement effort if they request it. They will give your shit up in a heartbeat if the right people ask for it (anyone please feel free to correct me if I&#039;m wrong). I&#039;m not trying to make you paranoid, Mt. Gox should work perfectly fine,&nbsp; but if you&#039;re interested in anonymity, I would suggest using bitinstant, with a cash deposit through moneygram. You have a variety of options as to how to input and withdraw (as bitcoins) funds, after which the coins can be put through the proper rites (laundering, moving around, transferred to Silk road) You can give fake information, no ID is required. Works like a charm.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link to a fairly comprehensive thread, should be enough to give you a general idea, should you be interested<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26058.0<br /><br />-Schmuck

However, there is nothing illegal about buying or selling Bitcoin, and there is also no need for Mt.Gox to have &quot;your shit&quot; in the first place. As I stated it is completely possible to use Mt.Gox without verifying your identity once you do it correctly. Even if you do have an account with which you move amounts of Bitcoin where identity verification becomes a necessity, once the Bitcoin is laundered sufficiently there is absolutely no problem with Mt.Gox handing your information to the authorities. What are they going to do, arrest you for trading Bitcoin?!&nbsp; ??? Once you cover your bases you&#039;re absolutely fine. Mt.Gox, just like Bitcoin itself, can be as anonymously as you make it.<br /><br />However, the BitInstant method is definitely a cut above the Mt.Gox method for users who are unfamiliar with how Mt.Gox operates, and how the Bitcoin network itself operates, so that would be a better idea for the OP in future. He needs to get his Bitcoin out of Mt.Gox though, and as such, verifying his identity and laundering his coins would be the best course of action in this situation.<br /><br />@ podro_hale:<br /><br />It would do no harm to read through the threads that both Schmuckk and I have linked you to. If you want to purchase anything on the road securely, they should be your first ports of call.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Thank you all for helpful suggestions! The link of security is very informative and I read it before posting here, but after Mt. Gox wanted my identity&nbsp; :(. PGP seems important. I have not made any purchase on the Road yet so I am still learning through the wiki and forum. Sorry for being newbie.
