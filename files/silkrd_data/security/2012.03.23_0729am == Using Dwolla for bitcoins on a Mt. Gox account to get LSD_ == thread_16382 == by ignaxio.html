				Does anyone have experience in knowing if this is secure or not? I want to order some LSD for me and a friend, only like 10 doses on a blotter will do. If it&#039;s not really secure what&#039;s a better way you&#039;d go about doing it? Dwolla is basically like paypal I&#039;ve read, and I have one set up with my bank account for sending money to my gox account. I&#039;m then going to transfer from my mt. gox account to silkroad, and am using made up information for the mt. gox account. I know it wouldn&#039;t be that hard to trace such a simple trade but I&#039;m only trying to get a small amount of LSD and I&#039;m just wondering if this seems like a safe enough method to you guys to go about doing it. I&#039;ve read that LSD is one of the safest drugs to order because of it&#039;s small volume and similarity to paper in scanning, as well as the fact that it&#039;s odorless and such. <br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Alright great thanks for the reply, how much did you purchase from this method if you don&#039;t mind me asking? And how did you have it shipped, like to your home address? I don&#039;t think blotters would be too hard to remain inconspicuous in shipping to people looking through stuff. <br /><br />Basically what I want to do is dwolla &gt; mt. gox account &gt; silkroad, and figure the rest out from there.

				I&#039;m sure a lot of people have used that exact method for that exact product!&nbsp; I think its a more secure like some people have said to have some extra step between Mtgox and SR (i use a bitcoin wallet) - but i didn&#039;t even know that when i did my first order.&nbsp; and got doses from a few different countries, as well as domestic (even safer).&nbsp; Also, learn how to use PGP encryption so only the vendor will be able to see your shipping address.<br /><br />LSD is very hard to detect, and established sellers here can be pretty creative with shipping methods , so I wouldn&#039;t worry about that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried him myself, but seems like &quot;envious&quot; is a good seller w/ good lsd, and is in the us.<br /><br />

				Yeah, envious is exactly the vendor I&#039;m hoping to buy from. I&#039;m just waiting on some stuff in my bank to settle and to get all my bridging accounts set up and I&#039;m set. I sent him a message regarding a final question I had, but perhaps you guys might also know the answer. <br /><br />I see some vendors saying they don&#039;t accept escrow payments from new buyers like myself. But I was under the impression that every time I transfer coins from one wallet to the silk road that it was instantly put in my escrow? If that&#039;s the case, how else could I possibly pay a vendor if not out of my silkroad escrow?<br /><br />Thanks again for all the help so far, seems like a really helpful community.

				When sellers say they don&#039;t accept escrow, they are basically asking you to &quot;Finalize Early&quot;.&nbsp; Usually when you purchase an item here - the funds are taken out of your account, and put into escrow - then there is a button marked &quot;Finalize&quot; to click once you receive your order.&nbsp; Once you finalize, the transaction is done - you can&#039;t file a complaint/ask for a refund/etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you finalize early, you finalize before the seller ships your item.&nbsp; So if it never shows up, you dont have any recourse.&nbsp; Overall, you want to avoid it if at all possible, but for your first buy or two, that might be tough. (Sellers are hesistant with new buyers - because some buyers will also try to scam by claiming to not have received product.)<br /><br />i dont know envious&#039; policy on that, but his seller page probably will let you know.&nbsp; If you do finalize early with any seller, make sure to research them a bit here in the forums first

				ah yeah I understand now. He says he wants 0/0 customers to finalize early, which I&#039;m assuming means brand new users like myself. That&#039;s reasonable enough, I can see why he&#039;d do that and the feedback on him seems totally positive after a long time and he has lots of fans so I&#039;ll go ahead and take the jump. Thanks again for all the assistance. Can&#039;t wait!

				No problem, i was in the same position 9 months or so ago, so good to spread the word on how things work.&nbsp; for a while, there were a lot of people scamming people with acid, but you should be fine as long as you do a bit of research (coming to the forum before buying is the best way to go).&nbsp; <br /><br />it&#039;s a hell of a feeling the first time you get something in your hands from here, hard to believe it actually works!
