				Please, take the time to read the forums.&nbsp; &nbsp; Do not send a large amount of money to a vendor that promises bitcoins unless you research them and from what I understand there are only a few trusted to do that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am shocked at the amount of money people lose by sending random vendor&#039;s moneypaks or finalizing early.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Keep in mind you do not need to FE,&nbsp; the escrow is for your protection.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bitcoins are&nbsp; a tad over complicated for new people to buy, but trust me those couple extra steps are well worth it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You wouldn&#039;t hand a large amount of money to a stranger on the street and trust that they will come back.&nbsp; &nbsp;So why do it online?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Its not that BTCs are complicated its just its getting harder and harder to get them anon for cheap.. Also these few trusted vendors charge so much in fees! 12-15%! Since vendors need to exchange their BTCs I dont understand why it is so hard to get some cheaply without the astronomical fees! And therefore people make huge mistakes trusting shady vendors who offer low rates and fast service... There is a huge demand yet the fees and the processing times are not going down. :(

				I agree with you the fee&#039;s are a pain.&nbsp; &nbsp; But when compared to losing a huge amount of money it is worth it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The bitinstant walmart way is fairly easy and does not require an id.&nbsp; <br /><br />Off the top of my head 500 gets you around 480, which isn&#039;t to horrible.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are a few great thread&#039;s on how to go about this.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I know it! I have been reading these posts and people are taking huge risks. <br /><br />I think some people are not willing to take the time to figure out how bitcoins work. Or don&#039;t get there is nothing illegal about buying coins. <br />&nbsp;<br />If you never owned a coin before don&#039;t jump in blind. Buy just 2 or 3 coins first and watch and learn how it works first. <br /><br />No matter how many vendors and senior members say don&#039;t FE people do it anyway. Giving up the only protection they have. <br /><br />Wish I could give you + 1 karma.

				The person that scammed me was a vendor who had a lot of positive feedback and average history. So how was I suppose to know he was about to scam me? It happens, we move on, we learn, we use Money Grams. The only thing about Money Grams is they ask for your ID when you are placing the order.

The only time they should ask for ID is when you receive money from someone else. Did you go to a Walmart or CVS? <br /><br />Seems that CVS seems to have an attitude. Or they just don&#039;t know what they are doing and think that people need ID. <br /><br />If anyone asks, which they shouldn&#039;t as its none of their business. Just say you are paying a bill. People pay bills or this way all the time. <br /><br />Sorry to hear things are going rough for you. You will figure out a way to use the sits that is safe for you. Like you said you live and learn. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				He/she&nbsp; scammed a customer of mine who I sold btc&#039;s too earlier due to the recent influx I sold out..&nbsp; I bet (DRUGS) has hit many more on SR&nbsp; than we know <br /><br />My buyer asked me to look into and - BANG - that shitbag was a current topic on the forum<br /><br />There are still reputable people to exchange with&nbsp; but - comb the forum first <br /><br />too bad things are no longer like before.. meaning smaller tight knit and the btc price was a 4 btc - even at 4btc when I was a buyer 1 year ago they were trolling for quick hits I alway bought from reputable sellers looking to wash their btc&#039;s<br />

				Like I posted in another scam thread the low life &quot;The Drugs&quot; had the nerve to send me these two messages today: <br /><br /><br />The Drugs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS if u want 2 brag and clown on me mayb i would post how i tricked u and green dot even after you called and said you had the receipts for your MPs?<br /><br />I am so smart I can steal your money while you have the receipts and the physical MPs and this is after you bragged publicly............ Sometimes I want to brag but I know<br /><br />that my most impressive feats are rather unbelievable so there is no point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />The Drugs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shunyata,<br /><br />So I hope your makin bank and of course smart choices.<br /><br />So I read the forums and I learned that you like to talk shit. But now let me offer you a deal ... u explain why I should allow you 2 keep your money and mayb I MIGHT let you.<br /><br />I am good at what I do and as you have of course realized despite anything anyone has told you I have your funds not green dot.<br /><br />So after all the shit you spoke tell me, why do you deserve this $ more then me?

Be polite and remember green dot did not steal from you. You need them to want to help you. You also need to make them understand that you aren&#039;t going away easy. <br /><br />If you can endure a lot of phone calls and frustration you might be successful. Just be prepared for the fact that they won&#039;t give in easy either. But in the end they might reimburse you even at their expense.<br /><br />Hope it works out for you.
