				Hi guys and girls,<br /><br />I will flip someone a coin for solving a pretty major problem I have.<br /><br />I bought a new laptop because my previous one is old and has a big gash in the screen so I can only see half of what is going on.<br /><br />I installed Tor on the new laptop (latest Tor software). However it isn&#039;t loading the SR. It just time&#039;s out all the time. This means I have to run my business off my old laptop with my old PGP key and worse of all I can only see half the screen.<br /><br />On the new laptop, I load Tor up, it says I&#039;m connected but when I try and get onto the SR site and the SR forums it just constantly times out. I have the URL&#039;s in correct, it won&#039;t load the Hidden Wiki or OVDB either.<br /><br />Anyone know what is going on? I think all my firewall settings are all ok. It&#039;s fucking annoying, I want to run my business from my new shiny laptop but it won&#039;t let me.<br /><br />If anyone can fix my problem, leave your BTC address so I can forward you a coin.<br /><br />Regards.

				It&#039;s any issue most of us go thru on a daily basis.<br />It answer4s to these issues for can be fixed my trying to change your Tor identites serveral times and if that doesn&#039;t work usually reboot the entire Tor OS will, it just takes a few tries of either method.<br /><br />nomad bloodbath

				hey mate,<br />make sure your clocks are working correctly. I.E., that the system time of your&nbsp; new laptop is precise.<br />Maybe that does help... but I am pretty high right now so maybe its BS.<br />Much love<br />M

				If it&#039;s not a clock skew (or timezone) issue you might look in your Tor message log, paying particular attention for entries marked &quot;Warning&quot; or &quot;Error&quot;.&nbsp; UPnP has caused weird problems before, in case you&#039;re using that.&nbsp; Do regular (non-.onion) websites exhibit the same problem?

				A few points here: Firstly, SR has just been slow as molasses the last few days, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on but I can&#039;t even get the password reset feature to work.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying off and on for about 24 hours. <br />Secondly, by &quot;latest Tor bundle&quot; I assume you mean the Windows one with the Aurora browser.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t have a high degree of confidence in that one -- seems like too many new additions and not enough bug checking before it was released. <br />Finally, running the Tor browser from a laptop or any PC where temporary files may be stored and then deleted opens you up to the danger of computer forensics experts searching your hard drive if your PC is ever confiscated.&nbsp; You&#039;d be amazed at what they can find. Liberte Linux is a very safe version of Linux that runs entirely from a USB drive.&nbsp; It incorporates strong encryption of all parts of the disk where personal data is kept, and a number of features that make it very useful for people demanding a higher level of anonymity than the standard Tor bundle gives.&nbsp; <br />Good luck &amp; I hope you find a resolution to your Tor problems.

				have you tried switching to linux? Free, stable, more secure, I have never had a problem.<br /><br />+1 captainsensable beat me to it while i was typing. <br />Listen to the captain<br /><br />The new aurroa browser has issues, I know. When I first tried it was going through tor2web by default.

				To properly resolve this issue remotely,<br />you would prob have to give out some information which you might not wonna share,<br />aka:<br />Which operating system are you running ( and yes, HUUGE differences)<br />Which sort of Firewall (personal Local installed firewall, cheap ass NAT firewall in the router, <br />proper Linux/unix based hardware firewall)<br />Are you running additonal security software like Virusscanners,Spyware Scanners, etc&nbsp; which<br />have a real time agent running while you run stuff.<br />Tor version.<br />and so on..<br />Consider wisely if you want to share such information as it could fall back on you...<br /><br />@ I installed Tor on the new laptop (latest Tor software). However it isn&#039;t loading the SR. It just time&#039;s out all the time. This means I have to run my business off my old laptop with my old PGP key and worse of all I can only see half the screen.<br /><br />my #1 would be, did you use the &quot;preinstalled&quot; operating system you got with the laptop,<br />or did you format the disk and installed a clean fresh OS ??<br />Preinstalled OS can come with tons of random crap software installed( google toolbars and shit like that) and all sorts of settings which you wonna stay away from as far as possible.<br />Never use a &quot;preinstalled&quot; OS if you buy a computer and you plan on doing serious stuff.<br /><br />I agree with captainsensible on the part of running TOR/SR directly on your<br />Laptop is pretty dangerous thing.<br />Using some sort of Linux is often said to be &quot;saver&quot; and more &quot;secure&quot;,<br />BUT if you dont have a good idear how linux works and how it does stuff<br />its not really save as you have to blindly trust on whatever the <br />Source of the linux provides as information,&nbsp; double checking soemthing you dont<br />understand can be quite a time demanding and complicated thing todo.<br />A Proper done WIN system can be as save as a Linux distribution.<br /><br />Either way, Linux/win/whatever,<br />for professional Use i do recommend<br />using Virtualization Software and<br />store your VM on encrypted harddisks and furthermore encrypt the OS<br />of the VM itsself.<br />The Level of control you can force apon a VM is much better<br />then on a real PC...(rootkits etc).<br />Not to meantion the fact, if you change hardware your VM<br />can be copied and your ready to rumble without having to setup everything fresh.<br /><br />TLDR:<br />IF you got your laptop with a preinstalled OS, Format and&nbsp; install a fresh clean OS,<br />add antivirus,firewall,true crypt and important security updates,<br />install tor/tor bundle<br />(If tor runs properly for additional security: )<br />install some vm software,<br />setup a VM with Tor/bitcoin/pgp<br />run your shit from within the VM.<br /><br /><br />TW

				find your torrc and add the following bits...might help some...might not...<br /><br /># Try for at most NUM seconds when building circuits. If the circuit isn&#039;t<br /># open in that time, give up on it. (Default: 1 minute.)<br />CircuitBuildTimeout 5<br /># Send a padding cell every N seconds to keep firewalls from closing our<br /># connections while Tor is not in use.<br />KeepalivePeriod 60<br /># Force Tor to consider whether to build a new circuit every NUM seconds.<br />NewCircuitPeriod 15<br /># How many entry guards should we keep at a time?<br />NumEntryGuards 8<br />

				I was having the same problem as you and this solved it, assuming you are on Linux it might help you too. Open a terminal and run: <br /><br />sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata<br /><br />This will allow you to set your time zone again, mine was wrong for some reason and I could not access any .onion sites, after running this I can. Its worth a try mate.

				I had the same issue. I uninstalled Tor and Firefox Portable. Then I reinstalled Vadalia only first( Not the Tor Bundle) and then Firefox 7 by itself and &quot;Walla&quot; issue solved.<br />I did it on my Win 7 PC and on my XP laptop. And it sped everything up. And yes I also make sure that the clock is correct on both units.&nbsp; This worked for me. Good Luck and no need for a coin. Just get back to business.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bikerbum
