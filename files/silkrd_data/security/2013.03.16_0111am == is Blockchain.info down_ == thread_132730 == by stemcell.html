				12 hrs later still no reply from techs, still cant take funds out of my account yet it shows them in there. It keeps saying insufficent funds when I transfer my BTC yet it shows them sitting there available for use. Probably the last time I will use this company.

				I noticed something &quot;squirrelly&quot; a couple of days ago - I kept trying to sent BTC to another address ant it would say &quot;Insufficient Funds&quot; when there clearly was enough. It also didn&#039;t have the &quot;Anonymizing&quot; feature available. I&#039; didn&#039;t contact the support folk, as I eventually got it to send most of my BTC to where I wanted it to go. Hell, I was just happy Bitinstant worked this time without ripping me off, damn them...

				you went through the same thing we are going through. did you go through any special steps to get it to work you could recommend? Im gonna have to stop using blockchain. can anyone else recommend a service similalr to blockchain to store money in off site and have funds sent to that seems to work properly and safely?

				The same thing just happened to me. I attempted to use Blockchain to send money to an address just to see if I would get results similar to people here and I did. It kept telling me I had insufficient funds. Are there any other wallets that will let you transfer anonymously? That is the only reason I&#039;ve used blockchain, I&#039;m pretty sure this will be fixed before the next time that I actually decide to send coins but I would rather have an alternative for situations like these.

				I used blockchain yesterday without any problems. Using tor too.<br />They have enabled send/receive with mixing again. It was disabled for a while.<br />You have to calculate the fees by yourself (0,5%) so if you have 1 coin in your account you have to put ~0,995 in the form.

Their tumbler is more expensive than, blockchain, but is much more thorough. Afterall, 2% on a thousand dollars is only $20. It&#039;s worth it to me.

				Blockchain.info was very unreliable this month. I had several issues with them (broken API, anonymous payment glitches). Also the support is horrible (1 week delays, etc).
