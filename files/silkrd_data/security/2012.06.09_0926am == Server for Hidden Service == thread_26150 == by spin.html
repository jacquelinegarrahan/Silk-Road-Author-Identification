				Just keep backups of your site, and never do anything with it from your real IP, always via tor (e.g. ssh).<br />I have carded several servers, sooner or later the owner finds out and the service gets suspended, but I can still open the same<br />service on a completely different one and keep the onion address at the same time,<br /><br />So: regular backups, buying with some untraceable currency or just carding, no contact to the official IP.

Of course technically speaking there&#039;s no reason you couldn&#039;t host such a service from your own home but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it! How do you plan to differ from the Silk Road?

				The host is very unlikely to find illegal content on the server, most of them will not even glance at what you are hosting unless they get abuse complaints, so unless someone finds the IP to file an abuse complaint there is a near zero chance of illegal things on your server being discovered. At least this has been my experience with hosting providers. I always host offshore on dedicated server though.

				I doubt you will find much lower than $100 a month. $500 a year is more like a high end VPS than a low end dedicated server. Prices for not offshore not anonymous servers are substantially lower but $500 a year is still pretty low for dedicated.
