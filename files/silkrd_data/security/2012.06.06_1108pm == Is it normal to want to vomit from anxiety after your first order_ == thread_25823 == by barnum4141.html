Actually, you&#039;re a stupid pussy if you just leave the fucking package hanging out like, &quot;Hey -- look at me officers! I&#039;m probably the item scribbled down on your search warrant.

				I spent a good few months researching everything I could think of involved with making an SR purchase (Tor, Bitcoin, and different encryption methods), then piecing the knowledge together into what I felt was a complete picture, from order to reception, with ways to handle issues in every step of the process.<br /><br />I was still a little anxious after the first order. Was definitely MORE anxious after the 420 sale, since I place several orders at once.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about it; a little bit of fear will keep you on your toes about security.<br /><br />Keep in mind your security process should be a set of rational, predetermined steps, carried out calmly.

				After u consumed it, yes.<br />&nbsp;Or rather you will vomit.<br />&nbsp;If it is brown, for sure, coke maybe.<br />&nbsp;But only the first few times of heroin use.<br />&nbsp;But no vomit tendencies before consumption.<br />Just ordering doesn&#039;t do that trick. <br /><br />Ordering is not on the top list of the police, selling is worse.<br /><br />And if the police arrives in the same time as package, there must have been made a very big mistake then...is it not?

				If you&#039;re really paranoid, as soon as you get the package, take it inside and write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on it. Then leave it and wait a while. That way if you get busted you&#039;ve got plausible deniability.

Nevertheless, nervously, I remember to lock the door. Wouldn&#039;t want to get caught engaging in something so taboo.<br /><br />Inspecting the product quality I see that I got what I expected to get. I am simply dumbfounded that this experiment seems to have prevailed. But I can&#039;t shake the feeling of paranoia that comes when something too good to be true, actually seems to be true. Like a lemming being led off a cliff, I can&#039;t help but feel as though I&#039;m walking into a trap.<br /><br />But the potential rewards are too much to ignore...

				OP does bring back a very memorable time.&nbsp; My first was a gram of molly that was basically two crystals......I had never (And haven&#039;t since) seen anything like it.<br />I would suggest developing your own personal protocol/code and stick with it.&nbsp; Having a rational thought process of risk vs. benefit, a few scenarios with contingency plans tends to help my anxiety.&nbsp; Also, keeping the amphetamine and coke a&nbsp; minimum. <br /><br />Fight the urge to tell your friends.&nbsp; If any happen to sample&nbsp; your treasure, I guarantee you will be getting a lot of questions.

And I stand up again, a little dizzy, not realizing I had even sat down. This is the hardest I&#039;ve ever tripped in my life. I have now completely forgotten about the paranoia from a minute ago. It&#039;s been a half hour since I opened the package but I swear to god it has felt like 3 hours so far. I can&#039;t even remember dosing. Is it possible to trip from touching the bag?<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s a magical bag. Maybe this drug is a way to talk to god. Maybe me not being able to remember there ever being drugs in this bag is god&#039;s way of telling me my life can be fulfilling even if it seems like I have nothing. It doesn&#039;t sound like much, but at the time this was a real epiphany for me. It moved me to tears, and as I&#039;m crying I start to burst out laughing simultaneously. I am completely unsure of what emotions I&#039;m feeling. I think this is what it would feel like if you were somehow able to chemically combine emotions into new emotions, instead of experiencing them concurrently.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As I glance away from the bag, Voldemort approaches. Sullied and soiled by the toils of war, my heart racing, the lascivious beat of death and doom echoing in its cacophonous rapture through my soul and all that I am... I reach for my wand. A glimmer of light tugs at my awareness, as I glance over to see the moon pass sweetly behind a veil of clouds, as if by some divine irony and poetic justice, the universe knows my fate and decrees that my light must too decrease. &quot;AVADA KEDAVRA!!!!&quot; I hear in serpent like tones, emanating from behind me. I am struck by this final, fatal reality, the apotheoses of my life, dawned into this single moment, as I begin to fade away. As the light dims, and my senses wilt, I catch a final gaze upon the night sky, as I drift into the unconscious realms...<br /><br />As I open my eyes the room around me begins to present itself, my vision clears, my identity returns.. as I look down at the bowl of vaporized DMT currently sitting in my lap. To my right.. the hastily opened packaging from minutes before, shouts at me as though a relic from the past, yet a reminder of who I always was. I think back to my trip.. how I began to fade.. how I felt the pangs of death and my call for answers, decay with their demise, and softly wane to nil.. As I look out of the window and stare towards the night sky.. the majesty of the moment hits me, as the moon.. in a movement worthy of Chaucer, in almost Shamanic justice, retreats again behind the veil of clouds.<br /><br />And later.. as time passed.. and I lived on and breathed and bled the air, that pale white disc forever etched into my mind&#039;s eye, it&#039;s true dimensions betrayed by the lie of perspective, and the void in which it rests, warped by its mass and density.. I summoned my final breath.. That image recurring, forever meaningful, forever poetic, resonating somehow with the story of my life, the visions I created, and the ones I could not, I am lastly detained by my final, unerring thought... as out from behind the veil of clouds I finally drift, a life of shifting sand and darkness, for into the light I depart and weep, what oceans and dreams I am about to leave, forever resting behind the veil.. As finally.. that pale white disc presents itself again, valiant, defiant, glaring in the eye of my inner mind.. Only to realise.. the moon never moved, it was only the cloud.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				ooooooooh? it was DMT we were talking about???<br /><br />I was imagining an as yet undiscovered wonder-drug that&#039;s perfect in every way because it adapts itself to the way you prefer to get high, because the mind can metabolize it.<br /><br />coincidentally, I&#039;m getting some DMT soon to try for the first time ever, so now you guys have got me super pumped.
