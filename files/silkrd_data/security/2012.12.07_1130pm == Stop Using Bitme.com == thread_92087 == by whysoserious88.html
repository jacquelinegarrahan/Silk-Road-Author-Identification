				So as many have mentioned on this forum recently, and from my own struggles bitme.com has taken a turn for the worse in the last week.&nbsp; Their market has become incredibly weak to anyone buying BTC.&nbsp; It is impossible to find any coins being sold for anything remotely close to mtgox weighted avg, or even its high marking.&nbsp; What compounds this problem is that even after you pay an ungodly high amount for your BTC you will still be charged a fee.<br /><br />This site use to do me wonders, but as of now it is literally screwing me out of money.&nbsp; Bitcopia, looks nice but I&#039;m almost never able to buy from them because they are only selling for a couple hours each day.&nbsp; Blue Sky sounds nice but thats only if you have a Bank of America near you.<br /><br />Closing comments, I wouldn&#039;t use bitme.com anymore until they can make a more reasonable market for buyers.

				I&#039;d agree that bitme has got a bitcoin supply problem, and those with bitcoins to sell (like SR vendors) might think about taking advantage of that.<br /><br />As I write this, there are reasonable sell orders on bitme for about 5-6% above the mtGox rate.&nbsp; You can move your cash deposits from BitMe to mtGox with an AurumXchange voucher, which costs 4% including both ends.&nbsp; With mtGox taking a %0.6 trading fee when you convert to bitcoins, it&#039;s about the same rate.<br /><br />The other method I have used to buy bitcoins, using bitinstant for moneygram to mtGox, I pay about 6% over the mtGox rate when it&#039;s all done.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I just deposited some money in BitMe, hoping to buy some Bitcoins, but it looks like I&#039;m going to have to either overpay or hope that there&#039;s a dip in value sometime in the near future. Nobody is selling for anything near the market rate. It looked like a good way to avoid all the ridiculous fees and cuts that every other service charges, and it still might be, but what good does it do me if I can&#039;t buy any BTCs?
