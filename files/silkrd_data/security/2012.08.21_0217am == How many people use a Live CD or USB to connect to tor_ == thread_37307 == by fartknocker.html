				Just curious as to what level of security everyone accepts when connecting to SR.<br /><br />Is the Tor Bundle sufficient? How does it erase the cache it creates when visiting SR permanently, or does it?<br /><br />

				I do not, though I am not ordering anything really &quot;high risk&quot;.<br /><br />If I were dealing, I&#039;d get my computer nerd back on and hamper down.

				I solely use Liberte to access Tor. I personally think it adds a lot of security compared to the amount of effort it takes. Honestly it&#039;s very easy to setup and doesn&#039;t leave a trace of any deep web access on your computer (except in your RAM which is of course destroyed soon after shut-down), and is heavily encrypted so only you can access it, the list goes on.<br /><br />You may not NEED the security if you&#039;re only making small orders, but it can&#039;t hurt, and it&#039;s really easy. My advice is to look into it.

				I&#039;d love to see a step by step guide to making a USB (with windows, yeah I know linux is better, but I know windows better :P).<br /><br />Unless there already is one and i&#039;m just an idiot.

				I use a USB to connect (Usually Liberte, although it&#039;s started having problems). I just prefer the extra security.

				Tails on USB here. I tried Liberte first, but it isn&#039;t compatible with&nbsp; my hardware. Tails is extremely user-friendly, though, and I think I prefer using something that&#039;s so professionally developed (yet still open source) anyways.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking I might even switch to using an SD card with a lock switch so that I can have that little bit of extra security by making my whole unit read-only when I want, but still keep the option of switching it off and making it writable.
