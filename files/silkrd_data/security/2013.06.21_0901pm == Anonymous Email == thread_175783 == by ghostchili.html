				Ok, let me preface this by saying I&#039;m using Tails via DVD.&nbsp; I have an encrypted USB for storing private files/bookmarks.&nbsp; Besides the encryption, it&#039;s physically encrypted with my own jargon that makes sense to me (meaning if anybody knew my password or hacked it, they&#039;d still be confused as to usernames/passwords etc...).<br /><br />What&#039;s the most reliable anonymous email?&nbsp; I have a tormail account - I just don&#039;t know if it&#039;s working 100% of the time.&nbsp; Sometimes I get email, sometimes I don&#039;t.<br /><br />I originally signed up for another gmail account, but because I login with a new IP address everytime it keeps locking it and wanting to verify with my phone (something I&#039;m NOT going to do even if they SAY they don&#039;t keep a record of it).<br /><br />With that said, what email accounts does everybody use to stay anonymous?

				There&#039;s also MailTor: bdom5vcb53z5hqz5.onion<br /><br />Like Tormail, no one knows anything about it or who runs it, so PGP encrypt all sensitive emails.<br /><br />It might be more reliable for sending to clearnet addresses though, since it has fewer users who may be abusing it.<br />

				I was able to sign up for an anonymous Yahoo account recently over Tor. It was a giant pain in the ass, and I did it for fun mostly. I only access it over Tor and it can&#039;t be traced back to me in any way. I would still use PGP if I ever had to send sensitive info though (haven&#039;t yet) as I&#039;m extra paranoid

I heard that BlueSky doesn&#039;t deal with tormail addresses so TOR&#039;d to yahoo. Of course, it was all in german or whatever IP addy I was at that time, and I swear I was doing everything right, and it took me like 10 tries for it to go through.
