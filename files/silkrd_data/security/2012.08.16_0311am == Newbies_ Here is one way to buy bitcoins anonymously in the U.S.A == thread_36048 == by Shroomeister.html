				I just got done helping a guy in PM do something like this and I thought that since I laid it out pretty easily to him I would post it here for any new person looking to get anon coins.<br /><br />This is by NO MEANS THE ONLY WAY. This is just one way that works.<br /><br />You will need:<br /><br />A) Create a new Tormail email address for this purpose. http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion I use to recommend mailinator, but it appears as though mailinator may be blocked because it is a known &quot;disposable email domain&quot;<br /><br />B) A bitcoin address to send your coins to (instawallet is my pick)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">HOWTO:<br /><br />1) Go to bitinstant - choose &quot;Major Bank Branch&quot; ---&gt;&gt; &quot;Bitcoin address&quot;<br /><br />2) Get your self an instawallet or something similar. And BOOK MARK IT. you lose the link. you lose your $<br /><br />3) Create some RANDOM ASS Tormail email.<br /><br />4) Go back to bitinstant and walk through the process. You will need your instawallet bitcoin address. Use your random Tormail email address.<br /><br />5) Follow the site through to the &quot;trustcash&quot; site and continue. Use your real localish zipcode. you are going to have to actually drive to the bank.<br /><br />6) Do NOT put a real name when the Trust Cash website asks, but dont put anything silly either. (The paper work you are going to take the bank will not have ANY name on it anyway)<br /><br />7) Drive to the closest branch that Trust Cash points you to. No reason to drive a 1000 miles to a bank. Remember - you aren&#039;t doing anything illegal. Buying bitcoins is totally legit. (Yes I am sorry, you have to leave the house today)<br /><br />&nbsp;8) I would choose to go through the drive-thru at the bank personally myself. Make sure you print out the &quot;invoice&quot; that TrustCash prompted you to. (notice no personal info on the invoice.)<br /><br />9) Shoot the printed invoice and the cash over to the teller. (No ID!!!!!! It is not needed) <br /><br />10) Come home and check your Instawallet URL. Coins get there pretty quickly.<br /><br />11) Check the Tormail email address for any crap you may have gotten sent. Delete it.<br /><br />12) You now have your coins. You can do whatever you want with them. I personally would feel comfortable sending them directly to my SR wallet. The only &quot;connection&quot; you have to those bitcoins at this point is your face being recorded at the bank drive-thru (Go on a sunny day and wear a hat and sunglasses if you are that paranoid) Also you are just moving coins from one address to another. There is no Super Secret FBI Database of &quot;Black List&quot; Bitcoin addresses. Point being no one knows that this is a SR wallet. While all transactions are transparently viewable, there is nothing that looks suspicious to this very moment. IF you end up getting yourself in some type of trouble and one of your bitcoin addesses is &quot;looked into&quot; THEN the trail of breadcrumbs comes between you and SR.<br /><br />13) If you do not want to send your coins directly to SR at this point, then you can now choose to fog or launder them, and then send them to your SR wallet. (This will cost you between 1%-4% of your total)<br /><br />14)Profit!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again. To all you vets - save the flames. This is again ONLY 1 WAY TO DO IT.

				I just use get-bitcoin.com&nbsp; I&#039;ve used them several times and they&#039;ve never failed me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just goto get-bitcoin.com ---&gt; select a major bank branch (BofA Chase, Wells Fargo) ----&gt; Enter bitcoin address (instawallet works great!) -----&gt; and then getbitcoin sends you an e-mail with an account number to deposit your money to. <br /><br />They charge a 5% fee which isn&#039;t shit really. You goto a bank and deposit money if you don&#039;t want it tied to you, have a friend or someone deposit the money for you, switch it up to keep it fresh! <br /><br />Once it&#039;s in your instawallet you obviously can do what you want with it. It&#039;s not tied to your identity in anyways besides a possible face shot on camera. And even then this could be avoided with different people depositing money all the time. ;)&nbsp;

				Thanks guys this really clears some things up.<br /><br />Quick question. Insta wallet, i went there and i just book mark the link or save it? what if people start messing around with the link to the wallet and stumble upon one that contains bitcoins and just transfers them to there own account?

Yes just bookmark it. <br /><br /><br />Stumbling upon a instawallet URL is like randomly guessing a bitcoin address. Not impossible, but highly improbably. <br /><br /><br />There are other options instead of instawallet. I don&#039;t have all my links in front of me, but I just heard of one on the forums here. Brain wallet?<br /><br /><br />Where you can create your own bitcoin address based on a pass phrase or random numbers or whatever you want!!

Hell it is SR.<br /><br /><br />Now - does instawallet to SR addy change anything? <br />No not at all. So I guess it is really just a matter of old habits die hard.<br /><br />(For newbies who do not know the ins-outs of BTC it is important to understand that any transaction between 2 (or more) bitcoin addresses is fully open, viewable and traceable by the public. This is the nature of bitcoins. This is what keeps them honest.)<br /><br />http://blockchain.info - go there and put in any bitcoin address you have used. Or even better. Create 10 addresses (instawallets) and then move a coin between them. Let it all confirm to the chain - then go to http://blockchain.info and input any one of the addresses you used. You can then very easily see the public and open nature that is bitcoin transactions. Understanding this I think will help you understand the reason that people take &quot;steps&quot; to get coins in/out (almost more importantly out) of SR.<br /><br />I personally have used instawallet as my &quot;go-to&quot; for quick coin storage. So When I first wanted to move coins to SR - that is the way I did it.<br /><br />For the total paranoid - you could fog the coins into SR at a cost of 1-3% of total BTC. <br /><br />But again I have always been of the thought that buying bitcoins is totally legal and a SR address looks just like any other BTC addy. Meaning that none of it means anything as long as you keep moving forward. <br /><br />If you do something illegal and get caught up, then it is a matter of how clear is the trail of breadcrumbs behind you.<br /><br />You raised a perfectly good point that I overlooked simply based on &quot;reflex&quot;<br /><br />Thanks!

Moving coins back &quot;home&quot; off of SR. <br /><br />I want to take the liberty and assume you mean that you move them off of SR, to a online wallet/exchange. <br /><br />Someone running the native bitcoin client off of a PC at their location, runs into a whole new set of security risks (which can all be over come mind you) that could then turn that potentially never looked at trail of bread crumbs we had been discussing into a forward pointing neon sign outside your front door.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But is SR illegal. does SR only sell drugs? no... just because i have BTCs in SR doesn&#039;t mean i buy drugs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I did not intend to imply that SR is illegal. <br /><br />You could very well be buying.....well actually...

(maybe not the best analogy, but cut me a little slack = 5am)<br /><br />You offer some very good points. It is in my nature to try to counter point you (or anyone else) to a degree of looking at all angles. <br /><br />PS - it is also worth noting that my default perspective on all of this anymore if from that of a vendor. We have a different set of security risks, generally speaking.

Should I transfer them to a non-SR wallet when I&#039;m not planning on making any purchases for a while?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Everything destine for an &quot;anon market&quot; is better of if you can remain anon right? So yes, unless you really (mt.gox) use tor.<br /><br />I do not know if the buyer have the option, but as a vendor under account settings you can add a backup address. the description is something like &quot;If SR ever goes down, then we will dump your coins to this address&quot;<br /><br />Needless to say....you cant lose that address.<br /><br />Also you are putting blind faith into SR Admins that they will send it to you if the road were to ever close. With that said I know some vendors carry &quot;rather large&quot; balances in their SR account. It is just the nature of the beast. <br /><br />I personally have a instawallet that I have never touched (moved coins in or out of) sitting there waiting for the day I hope never comes. I have the instawallet address physically printed and stored in a different location. I could not tell you the address even if I wanted to.<br /><br />Should I ever need it, I would still be blindly counting on SR Admins to do the right thing and dump my coins there. I have no reason to think that they wouldn&#039;t, but who knows what would be going down if that day ever came. :(<br /><br />For all we REALLY know, that &quot;back up addy&quot; could be nothing at all! Just a way of making me sleep good at night.<br /><br />Always have orders coming in &gt;&gt; Escrow &gt;&gt;&gt; Always have coins &quot;clearing&quot; escrow to your SR BTC fund. Then move them from there.<br /><br />Bottom line (and I&#039;m sorry, its late for me) is Always take everystep that you can/want to/understand how to. No such thing as being &quot;too secure&quot; right?<br /><br />

I finally created a mailinator email. Now where im running into a problem is when i went back to bitinstant and filled out the bitcoin address.the mailinator email and put in amount to send as $45 USD, i enter in the information and bitinstant says something is wrong.So i ask the forum what could be the problem? remember im new at this and just trying to learn and be safe instead of just doing things unsafely!

				Well with out the details of what its saying is wrong. I have no idea. <br /><br />It COULD BE that bitinstant knows mailinator.com addresses are disposable.<br /><br />Try this - Create a tormail email address and try the process again. If it works, then my hunch is correct and I will update the original post.<br /><br />Tormail - http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/&nbsp; &nbsp; (you need to be on Tor to access any .onion address. If you are reading this, just open another tab)<br /><br /><br />If you are still getting an error we would need more info, because it sounds like you are doing everything else correctly.<br /><br /><br />Good Luck!<br />

				1) Login to SR<br />2)Under Account you will see a &quot;deposit address&quot;<br />3) copy your SR address and goto intsawallet.<br />4)Once you are at your instawallet address that is hold your coins, you will see a &quot;sent to&quot; field at the bottom.<br />5)Insert your SR deposit address there. add all the coins and hit send!<br />6)WAIT for a WHILE. SR sometimes takes a bit to get the coins, but as long as you filled out the right address from SR and the coins have left Instawallet...then just relax they are on their way.<br />7)Coins will show up in your SR accnt.<br />8)Profit<br />

Hell it is SR.<br /><br /><br />Now - does instawallet to SR addy change anything? <br />No not at all. So I guess it is really just a matter of old habits die hard.<br /><br />(For newbies who do not know the ins-outs of BTC it is important to understand that any transaction between 2 (or more) bitcoin addresses is fully open, viewable and traceable by the public. This is the nature of bitcoins. This is what keeps them honest.)<br /><br />http://blockchain.info - go there and put in any bitcoin address you have used. Or even better. Create 10 addresses (instawallets) and then move a coin between them. Let it all confirm to the chain - then go to http://blockchain.info and input any one of the addresses you used. You can then very easily see the public and open nature that is bitcoin transactions. Understanding this I think will help you understand the reason that people take &quot;steps&quot; to get coins in/out (almost more importantly out) of SR.<br /><br />I personally have used instawallet as my &quot;go-to&quot; for quick coin storage. So When I first wanted to move coins to SR - that is the way I did it.<br /><br />For the total paranoid - you could fog the coins into SR at a cost of 1-3% of total BTC. <br /><br />But again I have always been of the thought that buying bitcoins is totally legal and a SR address looks just like any other BTC addy. Meaning that none of it means anything as long as you keep moving forward. <br /><br />If you do something illegal and get caught up, then it is a matter of how clear is the trail of breadcrumbs behind you.<br /><br />You raised a perfectly good point that I overlooked simply based on &quot;reflex&quot;<br /><br />Thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well: after reading that SR addies are not specific to SR nor are any BTC addresses specific to a site, I decided to go to bitinstant and buy BTC using the option to send directly to a bitcoin acct: a new SR account that I set up in order to transfer BTC to a series of SR accnts. Of course, one of which might be the acct that I order books and jewelry from.:&gt;) I went to a different computer than I usually use and did the bitinstant order. Made up a fake email for Bitinstant.com to send my notification to. Then I had to choose an option of where to pay. Chose a local option then went there with the printed ZipZap form. I gave that to the teller who was convinced I was going to be the victim of a scam and had to call someone to see if this was a problem. I was asked what I was trying to do so I made up a story about why I needed to send money to this acct. I had made up a fake name/ph #/Address and knew that if an ID was asked for, I would say I didn&#039;t have one with me and then leave if they said they needed to see it. Had to fill out a Money Gram form which did need the made up stuff. Then paid cash while the newbie cashier just shook her head knowing I was going to be the next person to be scammed. Got a receipt and did some errands. A few hours later, checked my SR &quot;wallet&quot; acct and there was my BTC! No Instawallet, no Mt Gox, No banks, No MoneyPak-waiting-to-see-if-the-vendor-took-my-money-nervousness! (use sugarmama if you want to still do MP, by the way). I then bounced my coins around to different SR accts by using the option of going to the &quot;account&quot; setting at the top of my opening page then using the &quot;send to another member&quot; option. I think this &quot;fogs&quot; the bitcoins through the SR tumbler and eliminates the issues of losing one&#039;s Instawallet codes/passwords. I don&#039;t plan on leaving much money in my SR accounts and only will put money in there when a nice new book is offered by one of my favorite vendors of legal products on SR so I&#039;m not worried about losing a large amt of bitcoin if SR went belly up. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Great to hear another success story!<br /><br />I recall now the reason that I use to use instawallet instead of shooting BTC directly to SR.<br /><br />Its because at that time (I don&#039;t know anymore) SR was taking a LONG time to show the funds. So once I could confirm the BTC in the instawallet then I could rest easy and shoot it to SR from there, then SR could take its time getting me the BTC.<br /><br />Glad to hear your legal spices and herbs are now able to be bought.

Again the reason I researched and recommended Wells Fargo is because there is nothing to fill out other then a deposit slip. No forms, no IDs. none of it.<br /><br />3)This was addressed up thread. I prefer instawallet to a direct SR address because sometimes it can take hours until you see the coins in SR. With the instawallet, you see them and have control of them rather fast. Then you can move them to SR or a laundry/fog service. <br /><br /><br />....these are all pretty much just about accessing the risks as you see them and planning action appropriately. I (nor anyone else_ can give you black and white answers to these questions)

				Worked a treat for me, thanks for the guide.

				I&#039;m a total noob and suck at this.&nbsp; I found out about SR yesterday so this whole process has blown my little suburban mind!&nbsp; Managed to get TOR installed.&nbsp; Then figured out how to use it.&nbsp; Then waited forever for SR to load as I wanted to see everything in this great new place.&nbsp; Got my instawallet.&nbsp; Got my tormail.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t have my story straight.&nbsp; I learned that if you use the word &#039;bitcoin&#039; anywhere you will suddenly be looked at as if you grew another head.&nbsp; I totally choked at Wells Fargo.&nbsp; Teller took one look at my piece of paper and didn&#039;t have a clue what I was trying to do.&nbsp; He then called his manager over who also had no idea what was going on.&nbsp; I said I was just trying to get some bitcoins for gaming for my college kid who obviously didn&#039;t instruct me correctly.&nbsp; I took my paper back and told them I was sorry and would find out more.&nbsp; That was try #1.&nbsp; Try #2 went a little better but I choked again.&nbsp; Decided to use CVS.&nbsp; Got the paper from bitinstant printed.&nbsp; I was trying $400 usd. Total came to 403.95 so there was that fee added in.&nbsp; I had used my tormail address.&nbsp; I was asked for a phone number so I used a fake one.&nbsp; Went to CVS and handed the paper over to the cashier who took one look at it and said he had never done one of those and he then proceeded to call a manager over.&nbsp; Crap... I obviously grew another head the way they looked at me.&nbsp; The manager said she had never seen it and I needed to go to the red phone.&nbsp; Red phone to me means red alert.... run fast.&nbsp; Thought running would look suspicious so I took my paper back and walked calmly to the red phone and got a lady at moneygram who then wanted the phone number I used to look up the transaction.&nbsp; Well I forgot that so couldn&#039;t give it to her.&nbsp; She said no problem we will just do it on the phone.&nbsp; She said the fee was going to be $24.95.&nbsp; I declined and said I would do this another time.&nbsp; I will try again tomorrow.&nbsp; I obviously should have memorized my fake phone number.&nbsp; Why did I get such a high quote from moneygram?&nbsp; The 2 lessons I learned today were #1 Never say the word bitcoin and #2 have your story straight.&nbsp; I thought I would share my 1st day as I&#039;m sure others will relate.

				Despite how YOU feel, there is nothing illegal about Bitcoins or getting some. If this thread has taught me anything it is that tellers and cvs/walmart workers are as untrained and generally uninformed as any newbie trying to get coin.<br /><br />Rule number 1 of this thread should be study your method an exert some fucking confidence. <br /><br />...nothing against you personally.<br /><br /><br />Go back to Wells Fargo ( or even better another branch location) and TELL THEM &quot;I want to make a deposit.&quot;<br /><br />...that is all you are doing, nothing illegal and certainly nothing that requires ID.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				Just to add, I recommend using a remailer when you&#039;re receiving emails to a Tormail (a service which will forward your emails) instead of giving out a Tormail email address. This way you get to use your Tormail email, but without giving out a possible &#039;Tormail&#039; red flag.

				I&#039;ll make a tutorial on anonymous remailers (for sending and receiving mail anonymously beyond just using a service like Tormail) eventually, but I can&#039;t do everything at once with all the hats I&#039;m currently attired with.<br /><br />At the moment you&#039;ll have to use web based remailers which are largely pseduoanonymous. However it&#039;s much better than nothing at all. <br /><br />I know our friend Dr Pepper has posted an example of a remailer, but I would caution you all to google all kinds of different remailers, you don&#039;t want a situation in which all we climb in one remailer boat and it capsizes when LE produce a search warrant and the remailer rolls over. That is kind of why I am loathe to be that specific sometimes, it is not that I do not want to help.<br /><br />You could come up with your own tutorial Shroomeister!<br /><br />This is a bit delicate area, since geographical information about people can be inferred, at least in theory, so it is an important area. In a worse case scenario, where Tormail + your web remailer give up their records/copies of emails, such a thing would protect you completely. You need to trust nobody, ideal situation. (because received information can be encrypted to your public key by the nym servers)<br /><br />Best situation for non cipherpunks without a tutorial is to use web based remailers to their Tormail. Like Shroomeister has been saying, these should be &quot;one time&quot; accounts used solely for this purpose, and this transaction. You change up every time. Likelihood of interception is extremely small 99.9%, since they have to prove it is you and also that you used these to acquire product. Albeit it&#039;s nice to have 100% for peace of mind and less paperwork with continually changing addresses.<br /><br />Actually Guru knows a great deal about this, you can ask him about them if you&#039;re interested in obtaining completely anonymous email send/receive.<br /><br />

				Woooo HOO! <br /><br />For Real. I didnt respond to it on this thread, wanted to just let it blow by I must admit! ;)<br /><br />Thank You. This thread started with a PM I had sent to a newbie and then 10secs after I was done helping him I saw someone posted a thread asking the same thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />... I clearly do not know what it takes to get a sticky around here, but I&#039;ll take a couple coins anyday!<br /><br />Thank you very much for the graditude FearTheReaper!!! You are a man among men (or woman) :\<br /><br />Pine: I totally agree (again!) There should be a &quot;bounty&quot; section on the forum.....a sub section of the BTC Beggar forum (another meister original) ...a person can dream can&#039;t they? :)<br /><br />FearTheReaper - I&#039;ll hit you up!<br />

Thanks again.<br /><br />Yes there is a limit. I do not recall what it is, but if you say its $500 im going to go with that. I feel this limit is more then likely to limit bitinstants exposure to issues etc. The most they could lose in a huge mess up is $500.<br /><br />I think I did address this up thread a bit. You can either wait a day and go again, or make multiple addresses or multiple branches, and do it all in one day. ;) <br /><br />My recommendation to the anxious is to goto bitinstant &gt;&gt;Wells Fargo, then stop somewhere for lunch with wifi, set up another Bitinstant transaction &gt; go do that one &gt; get some wifi and just repeat.<br /><br />I would also recommend that you go to different Wells Fargo branches every time for fear of looking suspicious.<br />&nbsp;

				Hey Shroomeister, if things haven&#039;t changed since I last looked at BitInstant...<br /><br />Their bank-deposit limitations are actually $500 per, and 4 times per day. So you can actually hit 2K in a day. :)<br /><br />Unless they changed that.

				Great thread Shroomeister! <br /><br />Do you guys and girls think it&#039;s a bad idea for me to be using my home computer and clear net for Bitinstant, rather than finding a computer somewhere else? No laptop.<br />Thanks

Bitinstant stopped doing bank deposits in late 2012. No need to follow this thread. If you need to buy some btc, you can use bitinstant&#039;s other methods or check out other sites like bitcopia.com.

				it&#039;s all falling apart and the real way to stay anonymous is to buy from a SR vendor<br /><br />bitcopia only accepts wells fargo and there&#039;s no wells fargo with in 100 miles of me
