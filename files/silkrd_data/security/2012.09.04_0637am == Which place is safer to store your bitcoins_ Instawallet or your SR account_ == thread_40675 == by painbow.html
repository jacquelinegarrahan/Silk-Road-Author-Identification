				I&#039;m new and all but I feel like it&#039;s kind of hard to determine..<br /><br />Instawallet is nice because it&#039;s a randomized generated link that you only know.. Until you bookmark/save it somewhere accessible and someone can easily go in and transfer your BTC.<br />And SR is very nice as well because not only you actually have an account to login too with a username/password, but you also need to use your PIN you firstly made when signing up to withdraw/buy.<br /><br />Overall, I&#039;d say my vote would be SR considering you have to login and also enter a PIN before utilizing your BTC.<br /><br />Regards,<br />EtherealAura

				Deviding your coins on to several accounts, seems to be the best option to me.<br />Don &#039;t just bet on one horse!

				I try to never have spare coins (market could fuck you over by fluctuating) but if I did I would definitely not keep them in my SR account! Just think about it... bitcoins = legal. SR = probably illegal where you live. If SR were to ever shut down or go offline even for a week wouldn&#039;t you want to know your bitcoins are safe in a instawallet, or even better a good ol&#039; plain bitcoin wallet on your computer. That way even if instawallet goes down at least you can attempt to contact someone or even ask for outside assistance. By storing coins on your SR account I wouldn&#039;t think you would want to ask anyone for help or even find anyone who could help you.<br /><br />I&#039;d say do instawallet or bitcoin wallet

				I do like blockchain.info&#039;s e-wallet service and of course the best option is right on my encrypted hard drive with bitcoin-qt.

				Ya im looking to figure out more about BTC seeing that I&#039;ve never liked the idea of exchanging USD for e-currency like BTC or LR.<br /><br />I&#039;m wanting to figure out how to keep my coins safe as well if I have spares
