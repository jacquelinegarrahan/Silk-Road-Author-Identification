				Unless there is some authorized pentesting going on, this probably needs some attention. I didn&#039;t want to take the time to post screenshots but I can produce that if this listing disappears before some admin get to take a look. So, here&#039;s what has me a bit freaked out:<br /><br />When the Cannabis category is sorted by &#039;bestselling&#039;, this listing appears on page 5 of the listings (at the time of writing this post) -- http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/category/1/140<br /><br />From left to right, the columns read: Test listing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;à¸¿0.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truenull&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&#039;; DROP TABLE members; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add to cart<br /><br />That &quot;x&quot; is a broken image link in the &quot;ships to&quot; field of the listing... And there in the &#039;ships from&#039; field looks like a naughty lil bit of SQL.<br /><br />The actual listing is just filler. -- http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/9033<br /><br />And the seller is ranked last, with no transactions. Member for a month, active today. -- http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/36937<br /><br />So, can somebody please tell me that they know this truenull character and that he&#039;s one of the good guys? As I mentioned, this has me kinda freaked, even though it looks like he&#039;s failing.

				Bad guy trying an SQL injection. I doubt it&#039;s SR staff testing the system for vulnerabilities, why would they be &quot;testing&quot; with queries aimed at deleting all users in the database :o<br /><br />Perhaps LE? Why else would somebody bother to shell out for a sellers account solely for the purpose of (attempting to) take out SR?

				Sorry for double-posting. Like I said at the start, I didn&#039;t want to waste time with the usual formalities when I saw something that might have been serious and ongoing. So I just logged in here and made a thread ASAP. I guess I&#039;ll search out that other thread now and maybe take something for my anxiety.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-.<br /><br />Thanks to you all for replying fast. :-)<br />

				&nbsp;::)<br /><br />Just filler. My pentesting isn&#039;t publicly visible.<br /><br />Besides, it would be drop table users, not members, as evidenced by various SQL errors &lt;&lt;<br />

				&nbsp;???<br /><br />So, what&#039;s going on, lookbehindyou?<br /><br />I found the thread that you started about the problems in the search box, but still nothing about this listing. Obviously I can&#039;t diagnose this, but it&#039;s clear to me that it&#039;s not Cannabis. That much I know.

				Hehe... alright... so, in the future, could you maybe do that shit in the benzo or opioid sections... putting it in Cannabis is a bit like yelling &quot;FIRE&quot; in a crowded theatre. Folks get paranoid enough already.
