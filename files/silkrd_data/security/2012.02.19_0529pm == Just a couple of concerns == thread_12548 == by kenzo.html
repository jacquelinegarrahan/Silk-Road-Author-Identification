				Frirstly, yesterday I accidentally transferred some bitcoins straight from the exchange (which is directly tied to my bank account) to Silk Road - I usually go to Instawallet first, will this cause potential security issues?<br /><br />Secondly, If I use a previous tenants name for the address and I get busted for whatever reason, would I be done for &#039;framing&#039; someone legally? <br /><br />Thanks.

				I&#039;d be worried about using a previous tenants name.<br /><br />Mail forwarding is an awesome service... I don&#039;t know anyone that doesn&#039;t setup mail forwarding after they move.

				Ive been getting mail from the ex home owner for over a year, considered this idea and thought sure enough he will decide to refer his mail the day i do lol.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard it talked about but are mail sorters actually this sophisticated to know if a foreign name is getting parcels at said address.<br />I know here a relative is a postal sorter and is definately not trained to identify unusual names at any given address. <br />Kenzo I believe it&#039;ll be ok if u do
