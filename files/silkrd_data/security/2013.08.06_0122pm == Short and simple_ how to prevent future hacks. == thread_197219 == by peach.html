				1st) It is not really javascript the problem (actually javascript is quite harmless) , it was a browser&#039;s bug handling javascript that allowed this exploitation. Still, considering the potential risks, disable javascript in the browser AND enable NoScript to block everything.<br /><br />2nd) In the same fashion images (jpegs, gifs, pngs, etc...) can be used to to create similar exploits, if a bug is discovered in Firefox&#039;s graphics rendering engine. Yes, imagine opening a cat&#039;s image, and bam, you are owned. It happened in the past, it can happen today, and it could be tomorrow&#039;s headline. If you want to prevent potential hackings, disable images. I know that it sounds extreme, but this type of exploitation is as possible as the javascript exploitation that has affected tor users. Both are not common, but both are doable.<br /><br />3rd) Third-party browser plugins and addons are common attack vectors. Forget about flash, Java (which is NOT the same as javascript, Java is EVIL, javascript is OKAY... but still disable it just in case), ADOBE (Adobe is also a common way to hack-in: pdf, png, psd, etc... have been actively exploited to penetrate systems), and other streaming codecs, and default players. All of them are extremely common way of exploiting your browser. Get rid all of them, and never ever install them.<br /><br />4rd) If possible, get rid of Windows. But Mac users, you guys are the next in line, so don&#039;t be smug and don&#039;t feel secure. Mac users and Linux users are also vulnerable, the *ONLY* reason that this time they weren&#039;t affected is simply because THEY WEREN&#039;T TARGETED.<br />Whatever is the OS you are using, always use a sandbox or a VM for browsing.<br />If you must use windows, ALWAYS use Sandboxie for your browser. SANDBOXIE IS YOUR INTERNET CONDOM.<br />Otherwise, use Whonix as recommended by Astor (https://whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page)<br /><br />5th) I was traditionally against using VPN+TOR but considering the nature of these attacks, I think that the tradeoff is worth it.<br />Only hire VPNs WITHOUT jurisdiction in the US (read their terms and conditions), PAY IN BITCOINS ONLY, and be sure they don&#039;t keep logs (pay attention to see who are managing the companies, use VPNs managed by libertarians/anarchists/hacktivists).<br />Use OpenVPN, never PPTP. You can know that a company is serious about security when they offer OpenVPN. <br /><br />6th) Always keep your browser updated. ALWAYS. If Tor homepage shows that there is a new bundle, don&#039;t procrastinate.<br /><br />7th) I strongly recommend to use Tor only for hidden services (.onion sites), don&#039;t browse the clearnet from Tor. <br />For Clearnet browsing, use a normal browser without tor, especially for non-criminal activities. Keep both activities separate, compartmentalized. There is a rationale behind this, but I don&#039;t want to bore you with the details... but potentially it will prevent many sophisticated attacks in the future.<br /><br />Edit: Added Whonix

				I agree with all of your points other than 7. Use Tor for everything that can not be linked to your real identity (ie: don&#039;t use it for facebook). I also would kind of say that javascript is the problem. I know people like to argue that javascript is fine and dandy and the browser or whatever is at fault, and technically that is true, but it is also true that not having javascript enabled makes you way less vulnerable to hacking attacks like this. Javascript should always be disabled, it is required for a lot of browser hacks to work, disabling it automatically protects you from a lot of potential 0-day attacks.

I actually have a copy of it that I took from that thread and that I used to create mine. It is very simple to do, no matter how un-techie you are. Moreover it has the great advantage that you can then use a VM with the OS you prefer, so this is actually in favor of non-techie people because they can use Windows with it without many problems (differently from usually).<br /><br />Maybe astor can tell us why that thread has been deleted.

				With Whonix, you run two virtual machines on any operating system on any computer. You don&#039;t have to use Tails, and it&#039;s more secure than Tails.<br /><br />However, the reason I took the tutorial down is because I decided newbies shouldn&#039;t be running any random OS in the Workstation VM. Yes, it&#039;s safer at the network layer in that Tor can&#039;t be bypassed, but that&#039;s like 20% of what can deanonymize you. Your behavior online can deanonymize you. Leaving unencrypted emails on a server that is seized by LE can deanonymize you. An operating system update that sends your license to Microsoft can deanonymize you.

				Buy a hardware firewall using pfsense or m0n0wall or openbsd. http://www.pfsense.org/index.php@option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=50.html<br /><br />Now your computer is behind NAT, with useless local IP much like a VM. If your entire computer box is compromised the hardware firewall saves your ass by locking out any traffic phoning home outside of your VPN or Tor. You can now alter your eth0 ethernet mac safely too. <br /><br />Speaking of VPNs...<br /><br />This guy seems intent on finding a Tor covert channel http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/l/Ling:Zhen which means they would stamp your traffic from a compromised host like the FH bust, then look for it at the ISP level after it passes the other hops. Since we live in a fully Orwellian surveillance state now this is entirely feasible. <br /><br />Consider tunneling your Tor traffic through Jondonym mixmaster servers. They accept bitcoins, and it&#039;s much more resistant than a single VPN operator to intimidation from US feds as the Pirate political party in Germany runs a mixmaster. Your Tor traffic then originates encrypted on your computer, then is tunneled through a second encrypted padding (Jondonym encryption) which would then be passed through those mixmasters and encrypted Tor traffic comes out the other side looking for a first hop in Germany or Austria. A covert channel would be impossible to follow unless they could gain cooperation of all the servers in 3 different countries. Your ISP would see a VPN connection to Germany not any Tor traffic. <br /><br />https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/operators.html they have a Live CD too.<br /><br />Benefits:<br /><br />- local archiving of traffic useless due to double encryption <br />- extra obfuscation to prevent Tor traffic analysis<br />- covert channels useless<br />- your ISP doesn&#039;t see any direct Tor connections when they grep the logs for the DEA<br />- disable Tor, use the mixmaster for clearnet applications that don&#039;t accept Tor exit relay IPs like bitcoin exchanges

At last with a Whonix VM you can be sure that many attacks cannot take place, differently from normal and it is more user-friendly than Tails (that for newbies can be a great motivation to update to this form a ToR bundle instead than Tails).<br /><br />I personally would like that tutorial to be uploaded again, and if you are really paranoid about a possible bad use write a caveat at beginning, but imo it&#039;s not good that newbies have not an easy step by step tutorial on how to setup a Whonix VM here, because it is a good step up in their security from using only the ToR bundle (for example inside an hidden container on Windows that leaks traces everywhere for LE to find and exposes you to a lot of attacks) and a newbie is much more prone to want to do this to upgrade his security instead than jumping both feet on Tails just because they can keep using their Windows OS they are so accustomed used with just some precautions.<br /><br />At last think about it.

				I trust that most VPNs who say they don&#039;t keep logs in fact don&#039;t keep logs.&nbsp; Most. <br /><br />It&#039;s what ensures 90% of their revenue I&#039;m sure, so if it leaked that they did keep logs, their business would be toast.&nbsp; <br /><br />But that&#039;s not the biggest issue IMO since Tor is primarily being used on top of the VPN.&nbsp; What is more likely to deanonymize you is your behavior.&nbsp; What time you come online, what time you do this or that, when you&#039;re home, where you go, (all stuff from cell phone), etc..&nbsp; This stuff isn&#039;t really strong statistically until a lot of time has passed.&nbsp; Which is why I plan to track my own behavior, and change things up with surgical precision every so often.<br /><br />

				I made another two posts about this, but I made a mistake and then took a lot of time to explain it and kind of messed my thread up, so let me give this one more shot. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This guy seems intent on finding a Tor covert channel http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/l/Ling:Zhen which means they would stamp your traffic from a compromised host like the FH bust, then look for it at the ISP level after it passes the other hops.

In any case, watermarking attacks are not particularly worrying because the attacker still needs to see the watermarked traffic at entry and exit. On the Tor network, and most other low latency networks (all implemented ones afaik), passive traffic correlation attacks can be used to accomplish everything that active traffic watermarking attacks accomplish. In the past Tor Project officials have expressed the belief that people focusing on watermarking attacks against Tor are often confused, as they are not really adding new capabilities to attack Tor (since all watermarking attacks are no more effective than passive correlation attacks against Tor traffic). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Consider tunneling your Tor traffic through Jondonym mixmaster servers. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are a bit confused, mixmaster is a high latency E-mail specific network.

The attacker does not need to follow the traffic flow, if they had to follow the traffic flow through all hops there would be no real point to a watermarking attack. Watermarking attacks are so that in a scenario such as this:<br /><br />Alice - Node 1 - Node 2 - Node 3 - Node 4 - Node 5 - Node 6 - Node 7 - Destination<br /><br />Node 1 can watermark the traffic, and then when it gets to node 7 the watermark can be extracted. This allows the attacker who owns node 1 and 7 to link Alice to her destination without having to observe the traffic as it passes from node 2 to node 6. The watermark can be seen as being sent through a covert channel from node 1 to node 7, which is why I now see that it isn&#039;t really incorrect to call these covert channel attacks (but I don&#039;t think I have ever heard them that before, almost always watermarking attacks). The thing is though that if the same attacker owns node 1 and 7, they don&#039;t even need to insert a watermark at node 1, because all of the low latency anonymity networks are already weak to passive traffic timing correlation attacks.

With the NSA, DEA and even local law enforcement lines totally blurred I don&#039;t trust my ISP at all to not be recording literally all my traffic and archiving it, plus with the NSA docs leaked how they tapped ocean fiber cables I&#039;d rather protect my local Tor traffic to prevent snooping and potential archival then decloaking 6 years from now if a major crypto engineering flaw is found in the protocol. Lately I&#039;ve been going through NSA recommendations for securing consumer devices on their mailing lists and design documents. They insist a secure tunnel must always be used regardless if the traffic being tunneled through it is already encrypted, and said tunnel must be a different algorithm. They&#039;re telling us something by recommending that and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s just whitehat paranoia. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in crypto engineering side channels these guy&#039;s offer a free challenge which is a good learning tool http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/ obviously you would sign up anonymously, through a non traceable email account and not ever reveal you are from these forums. Answers can be submitted in Lisp or any language you want. You will start to question the reliability of OTR afterwards. I don&#039;t blindly trust OTR anymore, everytime I use it I end up just pasting in PGP so hardly use it at all now. I cringe at all the convos I had years ago over clearnet with it before I discovered how fatally flawed a lot of open source crypto engineering truly is. If you don&#039;t know any languages just pickup the SICP book or watch some coursera.org courses.&nbsp;

On Tails, an attacker has to find a privilege escalation exploit to gain administrator privileges. Privilege escalation bugs for Linux are more common than VM escape bugs for VirtualBox. If you read through security announcements, you&#039;ll see multiple privilege escalation bugs over the last few years, but I haven&#039;t heard of any bugs that allow someone to escape a VirtualBox VM.<br /><br />Both are far more secure than running TBB on Windows or even a regular Linux distribution. The only thing more secure than Whonix is running Tor on a physically separate computer than sits between your main computer and the internet, which we call an anonymizing middle box.<br /><br />Also, you can configure the Whonix Gateway to use bridges just like with Tails.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, on what OS are you able to have the whonix VM?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Whonix is a pair of VM images that you import into an application called VirtualBox, which runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux. So you can get better security than Tails without leaving your favorite operating system for non-Tor things. Best of all, you don&#039;t have to reboot to switch between the two activities.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Could one pad tails with whonix?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You could &quot;pad&quot; Tails by running it as the Workstation VM and routing its connections through the Gateway VM&nbsp; but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, because you run into the &quot;Tor over Tor&quot; problem, where one Tor doesn&#039;t know what the other is doing, and you might end up with the same relay for your entry guard and exit node, which would kill your anonymity.<br />

These techniques are the current cutting edge of computer security IMO. Some people will disagree, but thing is even if you had javascript enabled on a vulnerable version of the browser in a Windows VM, feds wouldn&#039;t have been able to pwn you if you had it isolated properly. Isolation is the final strong layer of security that keeps you safe when all else has failed, and not having it means that when all else fails you are fucked.
