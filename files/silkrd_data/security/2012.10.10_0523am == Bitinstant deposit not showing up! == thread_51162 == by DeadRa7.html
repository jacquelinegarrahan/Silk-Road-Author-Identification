				Greetings, and thank you for opening this thread-<br /><br />Today, I deposited two moderately sized deposits into an account in order to fund my bitinstant account that would in turn fund my SR account (and skip over mt.gox, which I usually use but am sick of paying their fee&#039;s).&nbsp; One out of two of those deposits haven&#039;t shown up yet, and blockchain is showing that one never even was registered in their system.&nbsp; I called bitinstant, which told me to e-mail them about the matter.&nbsp; I am hesitant to do this for obvious reasons, so I&#039;m wondering what recourse I have here.&nbsp; I am `150% sure I made the accurate deposits at the right locations, but again, something seems to have one of them fuckin&#039; up.<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am sure that they&#039;d fix the error, but I do not want to give up my anonymity in the process.<br /><br />Thank you so much...automatic +1 to whoever helps me, as well as maybe a half a coin or so&nbsp; ;D

				Hey DR7,<br /><br />Do you have your bitinstant transaction # and the invoice copy?<br /><br />I&#039;d send that information and the deposit receipt information to bitinstant&#039;s support email via a tormail.org acct if you&#039;re concerned about privacy.<br /><br />Bitinstant has been solid for a long while, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a transactional issue they can clear up.&nbsp; that deposit is floating in their accounts, they just need to track it down with your help.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Yes, the last time I had to email them about a transaction not showing up, they responded so fast...within an hour or two, and it was resolved in under 4 hours. I &lt;3 Bitinstant!
