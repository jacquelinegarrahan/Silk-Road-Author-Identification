				with all the talk of setting this up and dumping this email im left rather confused. Is there a step by step guide as to what should be done in order of operations to ensure safety?&nbsp; Am I on the right track with:<br />Setup Tor email<br />Setup bit coin account<br />figure out how to fund account anonymously<br /><br />I have read so many peoples different ways of doing things im just head spun now. Or if there is an article that is the simplest in regards to direction could someone point me in that direction? I have been using the search tool, reading, researching, and I think im probably just making this more difficult than it actually is.<br /><br />also, im a bit lost as to why my tor program needs to be on a flashdrive? <br /><br />Thanks so much for any help

				In terms of getting BTC there is a ton of good info on the Security forum.&nbsp; Easiest/fastest way to get BTC on SR for someone new is to utilize Sugar Mama.&nbsp; She will sell you BTC for MP or even Western Union and Moneygram.&nbsp; She&#039;s always fast and reliable you can search her name on the forums and you&#039;ll find a lot of positive feedback.<br /><br />If you choose not to go that route, bitinstant is the best place to start for funding.&nbsp; After that it&#039;s a matter of making sure your coins are clean before transferring them to SR.<br /><br />I don&#039;t use TOR on a flashdrive, it&#039;s not necessary to really because TOR in and of itself is a perfectly legal program.

				Ron,<br />Thank you very much for your reply. I have already searched out Sugar Mama. Do you know how much she taxes? i understand nothing in life is free, im just curious.<br /><br />Here is the part were I get lost. I go through with SM say for $250.00 she transfers me the coins. I clean them and then I dont get where I transfer them to on SR. meaning I setup my account under this user name but I dont have the slightest clue how to create my own wallet I think people call it on here? <br /><br />I already have my Tor email setup and am running off the Tor program. Im just trying not to put the carriage before the horse and either lose my coins or jeopardize my safety/anonymity. <br /><br />

				Again Ron thank you for your help. I read the link and messaged SM. <br /><br />Sometimes I see a link similar to the one you provided me in a vendors signature. when I try to open it im asked for user name, p-word, and captcha. once i fill it in correctly im still denied access. does that vendor have to approve me? or am i doing something wrong?<br /><br />Also, I see under some peoples names how many transactions and how much money they have spent? is there a way to keep that out of the public eye? It seems like a blatant way to draw un wanted attention from LE.<br /><br />I also read in a thread you could make any purchases till you bought some online books or something like that. It was a newbies starter thread stating go somewhere on here and just buy like 5 and then you will be allowed to start making orders. I have searched for this with no luck. Do you know what it is im supposed to be looking for?<br /><br />Thanks

Sugar Mama is who I would recomend, I have used her several times and will use her in the future. She drops the coins right into your SR account. They never hit your btc wallet. You will just give her your MP info and wait a few hours.

				Does anyone know why i keep getting this message when I try to login into a vendors pages? the name and pass word and captcha are all correct but this keeps popping up &quot;Login failed, please try again&quot; Do I need some kind of approval or change a setting or something? I have tried about 6-8x now

I think these are the only possibilities unless multiple users start having the same problems. I&#039;m no tech whiz though...

				Bitcopia also seems to be a popular highly anon way of getting BTC.&nbsp; Seems the big BTC players are making ppl give more info to buy BTC through them.
