I am a newb, please forgive my irrationality at the moment. <br />So, this poses the question: If you are selling your wares online for BTC, are you only supposed to use them to purchase more drugs to sell? Because most people selling drugs are in it for the money. Bottom line. And they take some risks no matter what. <br />I would think some of those people would need some greenbacks to re-up, so you can keep buying drugs with BTC.<br />Still would like to see some more posts on his validity.
