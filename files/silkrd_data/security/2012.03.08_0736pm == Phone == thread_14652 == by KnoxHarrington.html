				Indeed, using your phone as an AP is equivalent to surfing directly on the device, unless you have your phone bugged with CarrierIQ or malware. It definitely does not increase your security compared to a landline, unless it is anonymous prepaid, and even then you would have to connect from different locations and replace the phone from time to time.<br /><br />Also, not all phones have CarrierIQ on them.

				CarrierIQ is installed on a vast majority of phones . but you are right, its not *all* of them.&nbsp; Just many many millions of them.&nbsp; &nbsp; And even the ones that its not installed upon, you can bet your ass the companies involved have installed equivalent backdoor software, such as it&#039;s main competitor , TerrierHaiku.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				if you are concerned about anonymity, use a tracfone, or other similar disposable, pre-paid phone. many of which have internet these days. some of which even have potentially anonymous wi-fi hotspots you could use to..anonymously do ur dirty work.. ;)

				I am not a fan of phones and consider them likely to be insecure in many cases. That said, Androids are pretty cool, and support encrypted voice, encrypted text messages, full encryption of contact lists etc, encrypted instant messages via OTR and they can have their internet traffic routed through Tor. I wouldn&#039;t even consider using anything other than an Android but I would avoid phones in general.

				in addition to what kewm said I would go with an android device that was created with an open source process, like the android ports for the htc touch pro 2/hd2 and run iptables (droidwall) with nazi restrictions.

				Any security agency can find out what you are talking about over texting/over the phone, thanks to the Patriot Act.&nbsp; However if you are small fish you will not likely be tapped, have an investigation team up your ass.&nbsp; Text messages are safe to the extent to the person you are sending them to is also a liability.&nbsp; What if they get nailed and LE looks at everything in their phone and they don&#039;t clear your conversations?&nbsp; Texting is just another means of spreading the liability.

				Protips:<br /><br />1. Pay greenbacks for your phone.<br />2. Use prepaid credit.<br />3. Take out the battery before and after making a call.<br />4. Throw it away after a couple of uses, ideally take it apart and drop into a water filled sink or river/sea etc<br />5. Repeat 1 - 4, but not at the same shop.<br /><br />This is literally the only way to ensure anonymity on phones. The FBI can and do track suspect phones, even when they are supposedly turned off. Your phone can also be used as the equivalent of a long distance microphone by the FBI. This is not some conspiracy theory, take this advice seriously. There are so many caveats to using phones that you are forced to go to this level if you want anonymity.<br /><br />Fortunately, you can get all of the above for about $10-20 a pop if you look around. So, disposables are the future.<br /><br />

				use &quot;burner&quot; cellphones like pine said. Pay 20 bucks for a prepaid phone (with cash money of course...), activate it, use it once or twice, destroy the sim card, throw the battery in a bin and the phone in a river.<br /><br />
