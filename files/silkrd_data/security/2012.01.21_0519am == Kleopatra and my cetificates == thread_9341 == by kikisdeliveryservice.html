				Hi,<br /><br />I am in the middle of updating all my security measures at the moment, and while using Kleopatra to decrypt a message last night, I had a paranoid moment.<br />OK, so my Kleopatra certificate is titled &quot;kikisdeliveryservice&quot;. If the cops seized my computer, opened up Kleopatra and saw this as as my certificate, would that be enough for them to link me to a vendors account?<br />I have deleted everything off Kleopatra at the moment until I can feel safe using PGP again.<br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Kiki<br />

				Thanks CrunchyFrog, that was what I was suspected. <br />So, running Kleopatra off a USB drive would probably be the safest way if I don&#039;t want any record on my PC?

				I have never used Kleopatra and am not sure if it&#039;s portable, but none of the other tools in the gpg4win bundle are, so I wouldn&#039;t bet on it. You may want to look into solutions that are definitely portable, such as Portable PGP (although that uses the crappy Bouncy Castle implementation of PGP), or gpg4usb.
