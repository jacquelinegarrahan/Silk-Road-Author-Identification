				I deleted my previous post as it didn&#039;t explain anything and it is too general... (note to mod, we really need a locked sticky on this subject so all future posts asking for the same info can just be deleted immediately)<br /><br />Ok, how to buy bitcoins.<br /><br />The answer to your questions is.... I can&#039;t answer your question.<br /><br />The reason is no matter what I post in response will be wrong to someone else either from a security standpoint or from an ease of purchase standpoint. The fact is there are tons of ways to buy bitcoins... google &#039;bitcoin exchange&#039; and look at all the exchanges where you can buy BTC. You can even buy BTC on Ebay... granted at about $3 - $5 more per coin but it is do-able.<br />I guess if I were a buyer and just need $30 - $50 to buy some bud I would open a Dwolla account and put some money in, then move that money over to MtGox and buy BTC at the current market price. Then transfer the coins over to SR... then buy my weed...&nbsp; with that said there are many people on here who would be like &quot;ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY!!!&quot; (in fact someone just posted over in the security thread about Dwolla requiring ID... something to think about)<br /><br />The point is there is no 100% correct way since there are too many ways to do it... just figure out what works best for you and try and be safe when you do it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />TJ
