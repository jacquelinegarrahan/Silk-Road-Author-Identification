				Im looking for info on what the rates are to launder 1m+ USD through the bitcoin network and how to get it in and out of the network. I brought this up as a possible way to get his drug money out of the US, but i havent found any workaround for the 10k limit.

				I was under the impression the whole idea behind bitcoin and SR in general is it would allow you to openly do whatever you want without fear of reprisal, yet you all act as if there&#039;s some risk in discussing it none the less. Normally i&#039;d suspect there was real information being withheld, but its quite apparent im dealing with small time pushers here.

Now If I was to disclose my methods on how to launder your money I wouldn&#039;t just be potentially jeopardizing what I do here, but also what I do on the streets. Now why the fuck would I help some guinea, who without a shred of proof comes to me saying he&#039;s got a &quot;friend&quot; with one million bucks that he wants to launder. You know what I say to people like that? Go eat a dick. ;D<br /><br />Want to know how to launder money? do some fuckin half assed research online or find you a fuckin lawyer. ;D

				OP, if your friend wants to launder that amount of money, both of you should have at least some idea of how this sort of thing works. Surely you realise that nobody is going to do this for you without some kind of amicable working relationship, and in the unlikely case that you are actually legit, acting a fucking mong on the forums is definitely not the best approach... mate.

				For an order that large you&#039;re going to need to go to the Bitcoin Headquaters. Not many people know about it but there is in fact a centralized system for BTC&#039;s. First, go to New York and walk down the roads until you see a man lying on the ground looking straight up in the air wearing a yellow raincoat, that&#039;s the KeyMan. Go to him and say &quot;Australia has some annoying Customs, eh?&quot; he will give you a blue keycard. Take the Keycard to the closest Mcdonalds from KM and order a happy meal with no salt on the fries, and give the cashier the keycard. He will give you a nod and pull a lever, go back out and go down into the basement through the ally that has just opened up. There you will find Frim Gandango, the Bitcoin manager. Tell him your wishes and he will launder the 1 Mil for you if you can sing him a poem without the word &quot;and&quot; in it.<br /><br />Good luck.
