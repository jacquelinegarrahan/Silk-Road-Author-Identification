				Hi everyone<br />I&#039;m obviously a virgin here, but would like to say how decent everybody seems. If only people like us were running the world ( or maybe we are, you never know)<br />Just want to share my newbie experiances, in case they may help some one .<br />&nbsp;Bitcoins, few what a pain in the bum for us uk guys.... <br />1st....virwox works but you may have to wait up to 48 hours for your first transaction to show. pounds to virtual life currency, then i waited 24 hr for it to be converted to bitcoins and deposited to blockchain ( they say it can be upto 48 hr for first time customers) which is usual for your first time users, after that it&#039;s instant. I used daily limit of Â£32 which ended up as about 2.8bitcoins - you can only convert to whole numbers, so conversion rate left me with some virtual life currency in virox<br />2nd...Barklay pingit does app work to blockchain... my first payment failed, it turned out because blockchain ran over there daily limit!!! (shows how many people use it!)<br />soooo.&nbsp; &nbsp;For uk I would recomend Either virwox or pingit, you have to enter your card details for both, so it&#039;s up to you how many times you &#039;launder it&#039;...I understand how important it is we keep the anonamous side of it, but hey despite how large your drug induced paranoia is, there is not a copper monitoring the small time buyer is- they can&#039;t cover police on the beat let alone every online purchase<br />p.p.ps I have read that they generate bitcoins through mining, solving algorithums!!is it me or does this sound too much like die hard 4.0
