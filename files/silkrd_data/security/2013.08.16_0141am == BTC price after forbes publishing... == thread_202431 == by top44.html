				brothers and sisters of Silk Road,<br /><br />Do you think that we ourselves can create a bubble on BTC price just because we believe that many people will come on SR after publishing DPR&#039;s interview?<br />my vote goes to option 5, for the simple reason that i think that people with no criminal record will always be afraid of jail. (and the above reason of course - just because we believe , it does not necessarily mean that they will come as massively as expected..)<br />from personal experience, trying to convince friends of using Silk Road.. it is not the easiest thing. . They do enjoy the products via me though, but.. i almost hate them for being such pussies. <br />So no matter the mainstream publicity, i think that MANY people already know of Silk Road, and many have given up on Roading, because of the NSA spy scandal.<br />Also, we at forums have seen plenty threads of Controlled Deliveries attempted and some vendor busted (afterhours). Yes these CD attempts could well be LE, or Atlantis trying to break down the popularity of SR, but some must be real, and a lot of shit has happened since the &quot;biggest competitor of Silkroad&quot; has come in the scene. These guys are LE , or snitches..&nbsp; please be aware Vendors. Its not worth it. <br /><br />Sure there will be a new wave of buyers, but (at least for me) it is that simple: You need to have BALLS to use&nbsp; Silk Road. And even bigger balls to use it for as long it is alive.<br /><br />People are really addicted to being slaves to fiat currencies, television, and capitalism.<br /><br />I made this poll for fun it is my first one, but please it is just a click! give your vote to what you believe.<br /><br />sorry for my bad English - poll will be running for 10 days. one vote, and no change. Thank you all!<br /><br />

				i feel that people will start to realize how safe it is once a major magazine publishes a major article about an online drug market. I get what you&#039;re saying about people being too scared to use SR. I get so hyped up when I talk about SR. I&#039;ve offered all my friends free computer lessons to learn how to do it, yet almost none of them take me up on it. I showed one guy how to download tor and access the site, but he never hit me back up to learn how to buy BTC. I think he got cold feet. I think that the average persons impression of SR is that it is some shady ass site set up by some fat computer nerd living in his mom&#039;s basement, but we all know this is not true. As for the price of BTC, I believe it will start to steadily rise. I&#039;m still on the fence as to whether or not i&#039;m going to invest. Nothing is set in stone yet. I guess it could be possible that the price of BTC could fall as a result of the article as well. Perhaps world governments attempt to ban the use of BTC, or darknet technologies such as TOR. I&#039;m sure something like this would have an adverse effect on the bitcoin market, although I believe that online drug markets can never be outright destroyed

				I really don&#039;t think there will be a huge influx of people because of the Forbes interview. Most readers of Forbes have too much to lose to even begin to consider ordering anything illegal in the mail. I think SR demographic is more into Rolling Stone magazine than Forbes.<br /><br />&nbsp;I think it was last March, the Free Beer and Hot Wings radio show spent an hour or more talking about SR and bitcoin. They did a lot of joking about dropping acid in the 70s and smoking weed. They basically did an hour long commercial for SR. That show is nationally syndicated and has millions of listeners. About a month later bitcoin prices were at an all time high.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t think being afraid of getting arrested has anything to do with it. If you buy drugs, you could get arrested. It doesn&#039;t matter where they came from... now I will say that I agree with the idea that first-time users are paranoid, I know I was. But it&#039;s also a lot harder to get a good deal with a brand new account, don&#039;t forget that. You can&#039;t get some Christy Nugs BD or some fire concentrates from j4u, you have to take a chance on a small order. And if you&#039;re afraid of getting arrested for drugs, I doub&#039;t you&#039;re going to randomly take the risk of having the Silk Road partyvan show up for a gram of bud.<br /><br />I say all these things, but I honestly couldn&#039;t tell you what made me start using SR. I had an account for 8 months before I used it, but you can see that it didn&#039;t take me long to put my trust in the market (see stats below). I bet I couldn&#039;t find any weed and had some money burning a hole in my pocket, and even then I probably held off for a week before I tried it. But I also never had anyone tell me about it, I was completely on my own in my first experiences with SR (not even gonna lie, Gawker article). But fuck all that, it doesn&#039;t matter how you got here. You just have to try and make the market better, ya know? I don&#039;t have any quality drugs to sell or I would, but I buy my shit and I post honest, accurate reviews as often as I can (or feel like it).

				Two things are going to happen<br /><br />1) BTC price is going to go up. As someone mentioned in another thread, theres nearly 1 million units of Forbes that get published for the Sept 2 edition. Think about that for a second.. then people show the article to their friends, relatives, so on and so forth. And those magazines will stay on the coffee tables and doctors office lobbies for months as well. That, coupled with all the mainstream press BTC is getting nowadays.. doesn&#039;t take a genius to figure out that people are going to want IN. And it will happen over the course of weeks/months, not overnight, as buying bitcoins is the biggest barrier to entry.<br /><br />2) The influx of users to the site will be wild. Look what happened after Gawker. This is fucking FORBES dude. The kind of demographic that reads forbes, are the kind that CAN afford to pay a small premium to be able to purchase their DOC anonymously and safely. Your boss, who previously was too shy (yet contemplated in his mind several times over) to ask the office janitor &quot;hey..uh..you know where I could score an 8ball?&quot; will register a SR accountt and realize his dreams have come true. And not just wealthy people.. but anyone who sees the ease of how Greenburg ordered that weed delivered right into his hands, is going to give it a shot. Once this piece prints, it wont SCARE people away from SR. No sir. I predict the site going back to the slow days because of the the influx of users.

				I think you all grossly overestimate the impact of a SR user influx on the price of BTC, but I could be wrong. Problems with the site might cause transaction volume to spike in one direction, which could cause some short term volatility, but additive demand for BTC based on SR publicity is not going to push prices around.&nbsp; &nbsp;SR transactions should account for a small fraction of a percent of bitcoin tranactions happening on exchanges.&nbsp; I think the majority of the demand for BTC is now coming from investment interst.<br /><br />

				I doubt the price will rocket up, I remember when I first learn&#039;t about SR a couple of years ago. It took me months of research before I was confident enough to buy BTC and place and order.<br /><br />I think a similar thing will happen here, that being said I would predict BTC to rise slowly and then more rapidly maybe in a month or 2 time, when the people who learn about SR for the first time are confident enough to make their first purchase<br /><br />S&amp;S

				More people using SR doesn&#039;t drive up the price, unless vendors don&#039;t cash out their profits into local currencies.<br /><br />Increased usage of SR does drive up liquidity though, which is a good thing as it makes the market stabler.<br />

I had joined up almost a year ago and browsed the site in amazement. I then joined the forums and read a bunch. Never ordered and drifted away from the site. Then, right around the new year, my local sources of personal amounts of weed dried up like whoa. I talked to a couple friends that had ordered pain pills or ritalin from here and decided to look into it again. About a week later I had my first two orders in hand and the rest is history. I remember I was so nervous until that first pack showed up...afterwards I think I invited my buddy over and we celebrated how AWESOME this whole thing was going to be...since we got each other weed locally. I&#039;d ask what he wanted and he&#039;d say &quot;just a bag of weed, man, I don&#039;t give a shit.&quot; I&#039;m like you have no idea the menu of choices I have on this place...give me something. Now, I&#039;m WAY into psychedelics that I never could find locally(or never heard of, like 2c-b) and never even considered trying. I fucking LOVE SR.

				SR almost has zero effect on btc price.<br /><br />When SR went down for over a week, many thought that btc price was going to crash. It actually went up like $3 by the end of the downtime. Go figure
