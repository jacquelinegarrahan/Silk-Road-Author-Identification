				A previous thread prompted this one &quot;How would LEO Attack SR?&quot;<br /><br />If you&#039;re permanently on the defensive, it encourages the aggressor. Historically the majority of soldiers who die in battle do so when they are fleeing attack.<br /><br />Discuss!

				This a good question, but I think we must also be on the defensive. Being defensive and offensive simultaneously isn&#039;t a contradiction.<br /><br />LEO resources vastly out match whatever SR could muster. I think being a little more defensive than offensive is our best bet. Also, if our attack is too strong (e.g., killing LEO), this could provoke an even stronger backlash than what we were prepared for.

				On a completely separate note, I&#039;m finding the forum&#039;s software to be really something.<br /><br />It&#039;s simple, yet elegant and functional at the same time. I&#039;ve been on a whole lot of web forums and this is one of the best I&#039;ve seen, which surprises me given that it&#039;s on TOR and there is significant design constraints. SR or whoever made the choice of forum software hit a home run here.

				lots of drugs here carry a life sentence for production or distribution and i believe that anyone trying to take my life is a threat that requires self defense of same nature. you are allowed to defend yourself in a life threatening situation... if i got busted with a joint id take the fine... if a cop stumbled on to me cooking an ungodly amount of meth, mdma, or anything of the sort i would defend my life as he tried to take it from me... so LEO reading this... youll never find me in either situation as it does not pertain to me. but think long and hard before trying to take someones life from them. we are here because we dont want to be dealing with armed scammers ready to kill for a couple of bucks and the people who manufacture the items here are helping keep the streets safe from these people. ruin this... and the streets will be littered with the filth we escape by coming here.

				I wonder what law enforcement agencies would do if someone made an assassination market. Similar to SR really, Tor hidden service and all that but instead of buying drugs you place bets on the last day a person will be alive. So you can place a bet that the lead agent of the DEA for example will not be alive on a certain date. The person who picks the correct date wins the entire jackpot, payable in anonymized bitcoins of course. It shouldn&#039;t be a Tor hidden service though, NSA might attack a site like that. <br /><br />The most scary thing about assassinations is how anonymous they can be. Look how hard it is for them to trace drug packages it is probably no easier for them to trace bombs. Hell it took them ages to get the Unabomber and they only got him via a writeprint analysis attack done by his brother. This technique is often very frequently used by special operations teams for the assassination of targets, so they seem to think it is very effective. <br /><br />Don&#039;t over estimate the powers of law enforcement. They are generally a step behind. We could pwn them. However the military would pwn us. <br /><br />Another good idea is the use of self made UAVs. There are open source software solutions for flying them. And open source designs for making little flying helicopters even. Plus you can even buy them, but that might not be a good idea. There is really no reason why you couldn&#039;t use a laptop in one part of the country to control a mini helicopter on the other side, just use a cellular phone network and a VPN. There are mini UAVs with cool features, you can lock them onto vehicles etc and they can carry multi kilo loads. Some sophisticated smugglers use things similar to this to fly drugs over borders, but they could also be weaponized easily. <br /><br />Booby trapped homes that you get raided could probably wipe out SWAT teams fairly effectively.

				I&#039;d avoid violence. We don&#039;t need a strong backlash from the military or intelligence agencies. I&#039;m also extremely uncomfortable about taking people&#039;s lives.<br /><br />Instead, how about we set up a site containing address and name information of law enforcement officers. Vendors can then cross reference this info with the addresses given to them by buyers to check that they&#039;re not selling to law enforcement.<br /><br />If it turns out they are, vendors could release incriminating details.<br /><br />SR could also offer bitcoin rewards for potentially damaging info on LEO individuals.

Positions of power are symbols, and MUST be assassinated in any revolution, but note i said the symbols must be assassinated. We are not in monarchich times anymore, the only method of removal of a sovereign&#039;s power isn&#039;t decapitation anymore. Though there may be cases were more than the symbol, the person holding the power is a dangerous and bloodthirsty sociopath, in which case, it&#039;s paying justice for the lost lives of the citizens, which is another matter entirely, and ideally would be post facto, if they shuold survive a coup or civil war, and with a proper trial, a la Saddam Hussein (not saying the war was a good idea... just saying he did deserve execution, but i think they should have sent him to one of those black prisons first, just him and his sons, not any of the ones that were taken. Oh, and Qaddafi. MAYBE carlos the jackal. That guy said he was fighting for revolution but he was really just a terrorist for hire who made millions from his murder of innocents.

				Hey random, i see your point there but yeah; wrong thread man. I do not suggest, plan to or encourage the assassination of journalists. The (unbiased) media are our friends :) In the gawker article thread i merely expressed my dissatisfaction as i would to a friend who&#039;d just screwed up royally. <br />No murder necessary. <br /><br />LEO on the other hand i have a serious, mother-humping, brontosaurus bone to pick with. I don&#039;t know about where you are but over where i am people are killed by LEO&#039;s every damn day over drugs. Every day.<br /><br />Friends, family? It doesn&#039;t matter. Just a delivery boy? It doesn&#039;t matter. You get caught, your life is over unless you can scrape together a half mil to bribe your charge down to life in prison. Yeah man, its like that.<br /><br />Needless to say, i have strong feelings about this. I&#039;ve seen the lives LEA&#039;s ruin, and the wrecked families they leave behind. The worst is when they brainwash a victim into thinking its all his fault, that if he just followed along like a good little drone the world would&#039;ve been all peaches and cream. Well fuck NO!! Its tough out there and there is something deeply, disturbingly wrong with the world. <br /><br />All we have are our loved ones and a fistful of perspective. Everything else is maya.<br /><br />So chill man, no need to be all &#039;shocked and awe and appalled&#039; with me. ;)<br /><br />I respect that you stood up in this matter believing the cause you had was worthwhile. Now, lets get back to the revolution; i&#039;m seriously concerned about this gawker thing...

				Right now SR is just an annoyance to LE and Government Officials.&nbsp; If you start plotting against, or threatening them, it becomes personal.&nbsp; Then you&#039;re inviting attacks on several fronts from organized groups that are greatly funded, highly resourced, and have more experience in these matters.&nbsp; That against a group of anonymous and loosely organized people who are in no way as well funded as the other side. <br /><br />The best things to do are: <br /><br />1. keep on your shit, stay anonymous, don&#039;t talk and finally, DENY! DENY! DENY!&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t speak for other countries, but in the States one has the right to remain silent.&nbsp; Take full advantage of this right.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Propaganda and lobbying is the best place to fight against prohibition.&nbsp; Its undeniable that prohibition has been an extreme fail in contrast to countries who have decriminalized drugs.&nbsp;

				I think some people here need to take a serious step back and think about what they&#039;re saying. <br /><br />We are not an organization with anywhere near a fraction of the resources and power that any government could bring to bear against the SR. People are comparing us fighting LE to some guerrilla fight, where even though we have less power, we can harry them and harass them. While we may be able to carry that on for a short while (best case scenario), they would quickly crush us as the public opinion turns towards them.<br /><br />For now, many of you are correct that we have an odd sort of moral high ground. I think that enough people recognize this to diffuse public opinion about SR. However, the minute we even start to talk about taking offensive action against them, especially violent action, we not only sacrifice all public opinion, giving their war against us that much more momentum, but we sacrifice any possible moral high ground.<br /><br />Even if you&#039;re joking about retaliatory action here, this is more or less a public forum, and there are people who can see this who won&#039;t take it as a joke, and that&#039;s a surefire way to bad press, and it would be hard to say that we don&#039;t deserve it.<br /><br />Frankly if you are advocating any sort of violence against LEO on this forum, or arguably any offensive action against LEO, you are more harmful to SR than LE is.

				If anything SR is doing LE a favor by reducing the amount of Drug related violence happening on the streets of many communities and cites. <br /><br />FUCK THE POLICE THEY&#039;RE OUT NUMBERED ANYWAYS<br /><br />There are more people (and a growing number each day) out here searching for new, better, and improved ways to get around this so called &quot;system&quot; than ones getting paid (LE) a cheap salary to brainstorm up ways on how to stop or block people from getting around it. It&#039;s like bringing brass knuckles to a gun fight. Your hit with the completely unexpected (whips out gun) then left with that dick look on your face and don&#039;t know what to do (unless you are a mixed martial arts master) which 9/10 your not. <br /><br />One thing that SR brings to the table&nbsp; is the power of communities intellect. I would have never though that as many people that are actively participating in this growing community of illegal &quot;quote on quote&quot; trade would be coming together collaborating with each other on a positive note ( mostly just want to either make some cash, offer other people around the world legitimate and real products, trip balls on some acid or smoke some actually good and REAL weed...etc) to do business while eliminating as much risk and violence as possible. Whats the point in spending months or years working your way up to doing multi-kilo transactions when you can&#039;t even sleep well at night because you don&#039;t know if someone is going to try to fuck you over on some dumb high shit or whatever. SR provides that opportunity to many dealers that gives them that piece of mind at the end of the day. (for the most part) <br /><br />However i must thank LE for keeping us on out toes about our shit as well as being that incentive to think of new ways around you mother-fuckers.....FUCK THE POLICE (alot of them are crooked anyways) <br /><br />Now as of what SR can do to combat LE... (My opinion)<br /><br />1.Continue our discussions and informing our community on changes, new ideas, concepts, ways to tell if LE or not to help strengthen our community and make our transactions even more secure. (Because i can honestly say that I would not be thinking about or paying attention to a lot of the small(er) shit that&#039;s actually important in this trade if it went for fellow members &quot;asking questions&quot; and getting informative responses. <br /><br />2.&nbsp; Improve our ways of weeding out LE from actual buyers/sellers (Non-LE) creating a system where only certain members are eligible to access a certain post not based on how many posts you have but from other factors that rates you based on things like: Relevance, consistency, thumbs up/down, useful information,ad im pretty sure there are more other complex shit that can go in there that&#039;s only accessible to DPR or staff or something idk.<br /><br />3. Work together informing new users on risks/things to look for <br /><br />It&#039;s one thing to be &quot;yourself&quot; than to try to think and be like&nbsp; &quot;someone else&quot;.&nbsp; Were just being ourselves doing what we do best and those hired pigs are trying to solve us like a math problem. Only prob is that LE will forever be &#039;Behind&quot; the curve. So lets search for more ways to make that gap wider and our trade more safer for EVERYONE! Like i said this community is doing LE a favor in a logical manner than the reactive &quot;Bang Bang&quot; method :)<br /><br />P.s FUCK THE POLICE! idt that could be stretched enough.!&nbsp; <br /><br />Let me know if this makes sense im pretty high right now typing this :p&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />&nbsp;

We want to hear different thoughts on this, that&#039;s what a poll is for. Just pisses me off that some people here think that cops are human, when they are scum. The good people always give bad people the benefit of the doubt, which is why they get away with it in the first place. Too many spyneless good people turn the blind eye. In this way, I can really back up your analogy on the jungle gym. It&#039;s correct.<br /><br />Last time I checked, only ONE poll option suggested &quot;aggressive retaliation&quot;. pine didn&#039;t actually say you should all DO it. What about the other options? Can&#039;t we be a little craftier than that? What about hacking? That seems to deliver more impact than just killing a cop here and there, fun as that sounds. And in this way I concur with ascent5154 and astor, because head-on fighting -- killing -- would not work and even if did work would not be effective. Changing the world one dead cop at a time is really limited in planning. There is no self-perpetuating motion that generates over time; if people stop everything stops. Too simple, too stupid.<br /><br />Carbonic&#039;s post is obvious common sense, but I don&#039;t think anyone here is advocating all-out war with LE. This is a more of a think-tank. Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. (And no that wasn&#039;t originally from Assassin&#039;s Creed for godsake. It borrowed it.) [Shit I&#039;m angry today.]<br /><br />The Nervax, dude, I like you but, I don&#039;t think SR is doing LEs a favour, or at least not the corrupt ones, which is most of them, because SR returning to the drug world OWNERSHIP. In the SR world, you make the drugs you sell the drugs you keep the money. In the real world, you make the drugs you sell the drugs you keep the money................ until you&#039;re busted, have them stolen from you, then watch from your cell as the honourable PoPo resell them back on the street, minus the set up, making, distribution, and peddlar fees. <br /><br />You STILL think cops are saving the community you fucking backward grandmas and grandpas out there? (Shouldn&#039;t you be in a morgue or something?) <br /><br />(Rest of your points are good though).<br /><br />Tools to fight LE would include educating people. The broadcasting of police abuse is one of the most important tools we have. However, where one can, the more information regarding identity the better. Hacking. Why chase snakes in the grass when with a bit of a concerted effort, LE moneypots are out there unmolested? Crooked cops personal bank accounts should really be a priority, especially as a bank investigation will uncover some unexplainable inconsistencies.<br /><br />This is just me musing. I&#039;m allowed to. It&#039;s a think-tank thread. I&#039;m no hacker. I&#039;m no journalist. Sometimes it&#039;s good just to get a mix of ideas on an issue, so thanks to everyone who contributed. <br /><br />Piece out (unless you&#039;re a cop, in which case I hope you get shot or stabbed or something). Drive safely.&nbsp; ;)

I think you&#039;ll find yourself shitoutaluck with that one.<br /><br />The police will only ever act AFTER a citizen or a citizens property has been harmed. I.E they will investigate the burglary.<br />The public simply has an illusion that they are protected by police whereas the only possible way that any level of police<br />protection comes about is indirectly from the small deterrent factor (which studies show is virtually not a factor at all to criminals committing crimes)<br /><br />In contrast to this, police are routinely/daily proactively physically protecting government officials all over the country.<br />So, yeah, it&#039;s common sense and plain to see who the police are set up to protect.<br /><br />Regarding the topic subject, my opinion is that violence is not an option both morally and in terms of effectiveness and that the only way, in reality that things will change, and it is glaringly inevitable that things will invert, is when more and more of the younger generation reach voting age and also gain positions of power/influence.... public opinion is already beginning to turn against prohibition and that, in my opinion is the result mostly from, again younger people getting older and having a meaningful say. So, one day the tables WILL turn and people like kmfkewm may well have their day.<br /><br />Does anyone know if at the end of alcohol prohibition, there was any pushback/aggression against the authorities that were behind the prohibition ?<br /><br />

In the SR world, you make the drugs you sell the drugs you keep the money. In the real world, you make the drugs you sell the drugs you keep the money................ until you&#039;re busted, have them stolen from you, then watch from your cell as the honourable PoPo resell them back on the street, minus the set up, making, distribution, and peddlar fees. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />True that Carbonic.<br />&nbsp;However, when I say SR is doing LE a favor, I mean on the basis that SR provides a peaceful place to conduct business, informing buyers, seller, and hell even users on the product(s) in which they sell ,consumer and are interested about. This eliminates a great deal of violence that occurs on the street weather police or civilian as well as believe it or not, decrease their payroll for hiring new LE. SR has a great stake in helping boost the development of creating STEALTH(ier) shipping by giving a place to share our ideas publicly and privately, meaning that it&#039;s not just a matter of them staking out some place they suspect and then going in for a bust. First they&#039;d have to find out who&#039;s dealing and SR makes that more and more difficult for them each day by making both the buyer &amp; seller more anonymous. This allows a lot of BIG transactions to take place much safer smoother than if you went the traditional dead-drop or f2f method which &quot;protection&quot; in some cases is a must (Weight).&nbsp; Trust me if your buying 1kilo of something, most likely that&#039;s not the only one your going to ever purchase. On the street, LE has ways of monitoring areas to pick out people involved with such sales as these, which in turn heightens the risk in getting busted down the line. <br /><br />Now as far as the corrupted motherfuckers on here, they&#039;re pretty much wasting their time. They&#039;re already brainwashed, fuck-ups (that goes for most LE)&nbsp; in life already and will eventually meet their fate down the line regardless (simply because they sold their soul for a 45k salary, the ability to run red lights/speed and a dozen jelly doughnuts oh and also the ability to feel like a tough guy with their badge only when they&#039;re ON DUTY). Eventually, someones going to say &quot;fuck you&quot; back to them and not in a so nice way if you know what I mean. <br /><br />Of course SR is accessible to everyone in a sense so LE is partially in the door, but again they&#039;re people who take orders (don&#039;t have control over their own minds) to bring down people who control their own minds and are collectively working together to make themselves and SR as a whole more secure. Were the fishermen they&#039;re the fish (dumb)<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t think extremely hard think about what i do, for the most part i just do &quot;it&quot; and &quot;it&quot; happens. That distinguishes the real from the fake.<br /><br />LE is stuck on &quot;it&quot; because they &quot;don&#039;t&quot; know, and they probably never will, because by the time they catch up it&#039;s already obsolete. That explains a lot of why SR is still standing strong till this day! <br /><br />

				There was one quote where it was not clear that it was not you writing. That, I should have picked up on before quoting, but I didn&#039;t. Sorry if it came across in a way that you feel misquoted you, it does look that way on one of the quotes; I&#039;ve gone through it and the rest appears clear. I wondered at that point if it might have looked clearer with auto quotes and not manual ones? <br /><br />We both concur on the same thing though -- systematic killing of cops, at least small time cops, won&#039;t solve a lot. It&#039;d be okay if it was one here or there, made to look like an accident. If you somehow manage to strip all the leaves from a tree, it would be a lot of effort, and worthless. I believe the best mantra is exposure, and more importantly, hacking. Knowing every move the LE make before they make it is in my opinion, merely a preliminary step. Trojans and other surveillance should really be more than considered.<br /><br />Still don&#039;t agree with % of LE who are assholes. I believe that the systematic way they are trained makes every cop a threat, and equally a target. Don&#039;t think I&#039;m an absolutist. Also, naive people who say something can&#039;t be black and white are like people who say not all fish must live in the sea, some must live on land. Course they live in the water. That&#039;s why they&#039;re fish. :-\ Hope that was clear. Some cops are worse than others, but if someone&#039;s holding a badge, they&#039;ve been trained by the same methods. Only female cops seem to have a brain, and even then.......<br /><br />+1 for taking this well. btw auto quotes are really handy to use. And I don&#039;t have hostility issues. I have ethical issues. When I see something wrong, I point it out. Piece out.

				As viscerally satisfying as violence can sound I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be able to effect change about drug prohibition.&nbsp; Look at how many people have been killed in Mexico since they stepped up their drug war at the behest of the US, I don&#039;t see the president of Mexico saying &quot;eh fuck you El Norte, we&#039;re legalizing everything to stop the violence&quot;&nbsp; Even if anti-prohibition violence could be directed towards the top political leaders who fap hardest to the war on drugs, that&#039;d just bump enforcing prohibition up in priority for every agency that has their hands in it, plus turn public opinion against you and give the prohibition propagandists perfect fodder.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not a winable fight.<br /><br />Stealth, education and bribery are the best things to focus on.&nbsp; Organized lobbying is a good idea, after all that&#039;s just bribery at the highest levels, but that takes a lot more money &amp; organization than paying off low level LE workers.&nbsp; I am reminded of hearing about how Frank Lucas&#039; organization used to pay off beat cops with 10-40 times what they make in a year.&nbsp; Everyone has a price.&nbsp; I wonder if it came to it how much SR management could swing for a bribes budget.&nbsp; May already have one going now that I think about it.

				I can think of one option that could be quite effective.<br /><br />It would be to steal incriminating or sensitive data from people that work for the DEA (it should be focused on individuals that are a special threat against SR) by hacking computers, emails etc. Most people have some racket going on, porn, drugs, infidelity, corruption, breaking regulations etc etc. When you find the information you make it public and thereby hurt the person, alternatively it can be used to even greater damage to blackmail them. The best that can happen is that they lose their job. This will cause the DEA to lose manpower with know-how and it will be demoralizing for those working there and make the DEA seem like a bunch of criminals and hypocrites.<br /><br />This should be done without making it obvious who carried out the attack, it will appear as the work of just anonymous hackers. They will also not be able to defend themselves because that would mean actively trying to protect their own workers from the law.

I think stoner junkies refer to it as a bong.<br /><br />I gave him a warning and did not inform the police of what I knew. I gave that son of a bitch the benefit of the doubt when he promised me that he would turn his life around. (he was still young mid 20&#039;s).<br />Anyway, while out walking my dog in the morning down the woods, what did I see?<br />Well I smelled it before I saw him! I thought that it was just another junkie waiting to pounce on me and mug me.<br />Oh no! it was that young fellow who I had tried to save, smoking a bloody joint. grrr! The furious anger built up inside of me and I went ape shit.<br />How could someone be so two faced as to throw back in my face the helping hand that I had offered to him to quit while he was ahead?<br /><br />I did not even wait for a reply, I just made my anger known, smiled, turned around and walked off. Off to the nearest phone so I could report his wrong doings.<br /><br />One appointment later at the local police office a statement was made. Though the officer at the station said that they would be unlikely to get a search warrant on just that statement, I could rest easy knowing that I had done the right thing.<br />What do you know next week sometime he was lifted for a random stop and search on the street! He was found with nearly 2 grams of mary jane for christ sake. This was just the tip of the iceberg though and when they searched his home based on this new evidence along with my statement they found other things. H was found to have more than 1 ounce along with a set of ultra high precision scales and drugs bags.<br />He was a dealer, the shame of being in a family with criminals was great but the evil little shit got his just deserts for lying to me.<br />The prison sentence was only 1 month which was suspended for 6 because it was a first offense. I thought that this was weak but was pleased to here when he lost his job, his car and his family.<br />Pity he did not have a house to lose but he did get thrown out of his current address and wound up living in a bad neighborhood along side his own ilk.<br />Now I hear that he is jobless and in the gutter shooting heroin. All because he would not quit the weed when I had advised him to.<br />I gave him a chance but in the end I had to get righteous on his ass. haha!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU HAVE BEEN ALL OVER YOUTUBE GOING ON WITH THIS SAME NONSENSICAL PREJUDICIAL GARBAGE ON PRO-DRUG LEGALIZATION VIDEOS.<br /><br />WE SUGGEST YOU LEAVE NOW YOU NARC TROLL...<br /><br />YOU ARE WARNED!

				Not sure how much impact it would have even if every single SR user did it.&nbsp; But one way to attack would be to slow the mail service by every time you have legitimate mail to send (not containing any drugs) make sure that mail has as many red flags as possible.&nbsp; Theoretically if there was enough packages backed up for the postal inspector to look at it could make that portion of the LE system non functional.<br /><br />I have always wondered if there was an easily obtainable chemical that reacts when exposed to oxygen or light by changing color.&nbsp; Then one could send packages to oneself or others and know if your mail was being inspected by looking for sings of the reaction.

				id take a steak knife and slowly push it into the pigs stomach. Making him sequel like a fat slob. I would spit into his mouth while I felt his warm blood drip down my hand. I would then begin to slowly twist the knife counter clock wise, and close my eyes, enjoying the wet sounds of his stomach being cut open. I would drag my hand left and cut a nice long incision so that his intestines could begin to fall out. As i heard the gushing sound of them falling on the floor, I would begin to ejaculate. <br /><br />I would quickly pull down my pants and shake my dick so that the cum could be flung all over the pigs shivering body. When I was done, I would pull the knife out and wipe my dick off on the pigs lips. If he was still alive I would plunge the knife in him again, this time in his neck. Cutting it open and listening to the sounds of it gurgle and bubble while my dick goes soft. When it was done and the pig was dead, I would kneel at his head and gently lower my balls in and out of his twitching lips. Making sure to let my ball slime get all over his face.&nbsp;

				As great as this online market is, the drugs aren&#039;t the problem.

This is serious money that the Govt cannot control. Samething with BTC, if you &quot;invest&quot; in BTC at 13.3 and the price jumps to 13.7, you profit $0.40/bitcoin you hold, TAX FREE.<br /><br />The LEO&#039;s major problem here maybe the drugs, but the system&#039;s problem is that this is an unregulated economy, and they HATE not having their fingers in the pot.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------<br /><br />Back on topic: <br /><br />The best way to &quot;deal&quot; with the LEO is to avoid them.

This has brought to my attention just how sick and depraved you are BiB. Your time will come. To even begin to compare the brutal rape of children, their innocence forever lost due to the actions of this low life bastard. Any child who has endured such pain will be both physically and emotionally scarred for life and one could safely say that they will never be the same again, their childhood effectively ripped away by a creature. God, my blood boils when this pathetic excuse for a human being is allowed to live amongst us knowing full well he has destroyed the life of an innocent child. Sorry, I was being carried away in the emotion of an adult hurting a child. BiB, I truly hope you suffer in your life and fall victim to an act of violence which leaves you permanently scarred for life. Only then will you have an inkling towards the level of devastation you were responsible for.To compare a Pedophile to a person who works hard, pays his taxes and has never stolen a thing from anybody or hurt someone throughout his life is just ludicrous!! Pedophiles and cunts like yourself who protect them, will eventually feel the force of an unprecedented all out attack, which will leave you in pain you have never before experienced and will never forget! BiB, forever tainted as a protector of Pedophiles! One sick bastard.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				We have no moral reason to not assassinate LE. We have no obligation to allow ourselves to be subjected to the unjust rules of a brainwashed society. It is quite apparent that those who are in favor of drug laws are either brainwashed or slave traders. It is okay for us to have pity on those who are brainwashed, but it is wrong for us to suffer for their mental weakness. Slave traders deserve to die. Look at the people who are most in favor of continuing the war on drugs, police, &#039;addiction specialists&#039;, people in the prison industry, people at drug testing companies, etc. Of course they give as many reasons as they can for why they would like to continue the war on drugs, always they say that their goal is to help people. But it only takes the smallest amount of common sense to see that their goal is to make a profit. Their goal is to make a profit off of our unjust imprisonment and this is nothing other than slavery. These people do not deserve to live and if killing them is in any way beneficial to us then they should be killed. Maybe people just need to see that they have a choice, they can let us be free or they can live in a war zone. They already live in a war zone but the only people who are feeling that in a significant way are us. The people who are dying preventable deaths from impure drugs and drugs like PMA marketed as MDMA? They are casualties to the chemical warfare of the DEA. The people dying in prisons for drug charges are nothing other than slaves, people whose lives have been sacrificed so some fucking DEA agent can have a job. The people getting HIV from dirty needles are the victims of biological warfare. It is unconventional warfare against us and slavery against us, only extreme pacifists could wish anything on them other than the same exact death and misery they dish out onto us. Fuck them, as long as they want to kill us let them be killed.

				Well I guess the first step would be identification of targets. Who are some big name people supporting the prohibitionist agenda? Karen Tandy comes to mind, &#039;Karen Tandy is senior vice president of Public Affairs and Communications for Motorola&#039; is her current position but she used to be head of the DEA. I wonder how good her security is? I mean does her limo take a predictable route on her way from her mansion to her place of business? How hard is it to make a mini UAV rigged up with some plastic explosives? <br /><br />That would be one strategy anyway. Assuming that she (or any other person in her position) has adequate security, you can always move down the list until you find one that doesn&#039;t. The best thing about prohibitionists is that they tend to work for these really centralized agencies with headquarter buildings and such. I mean , wiping out an entire building is certainly possible although it does carry the potential for a lot of collateral damage and that is something more fit of our enemies to accept than us. <br /><br />If enough small targets are identified a simultaneous attack against all of them would be of equal if not greater significance than an attack on a more highly protected bigger name target. For example, once identified a thousand law enforcement mailing addresses, dropping enough bomb packs to hit all of them is in the realm of possibility. Still brings up the issue of possible collateral damage though, we really shouldn&#039;t let anymore innocent people die from the war on drugs than already have. Wouldn&#039;t want DEA agents daughter to open up a bomb packet meant for her cockroach father, not that her cockroach father cares about the daughters who are dying from impure drugs. <br /><br />The best bet would of course be to maintain anonymity , you can have all the guns in the world and you can&#039;t match an army , but you can make a thousand bomb packets and anonymously mail them out in one go. Thinking in terms of traditional symmetric warfare would mean that we don&#039;t even do anything because we will be completely annihilated, but reality has shown that combatants who fully utilize certain strategies can successfully oppose much larger attackers. I guess one mans terrorist is the next mans freedom fighter would never be a more applicable statement.

I gave that son of a bitch the benefit of the doubt when he promised me that he would turn his life around. (he was still young mid 20&#039;s).<br />Anyway, while out walking my dog in the morning down the woods, what did I see?<br />Well I smelled it before I saw him! I thought that it was just another junkie waiting to pounce on me and mug me.<br />Oh no! it was that young fellow who I had tried to save, smoking a bloody joint. grrr! The furious anger built up inside of me and I went ape shit.<br />How could someone be so two faced as to throw back in my face the helping hand that I had offered to him to quit while he was ahead?<br /><br />I did not even wait for a reply, I just made my anger known, smiled, turned around and walked off. Off to the nearest phone so I could report his wrong doings.<br /><br />One appointment later at the local police office a statement was made. Though the officer at the station said that they would be unlikely to get a search warrant on just that statement, I could rest easy knowing that I had done the right thing.<br />What do you know next week sometime he was lifted for a random stop and search on the street! He was found with nearly 2 grams of mary jane for christ sake. This was just the tip of the iceberg though and when they searched his home based on this new evidence along with my statement they found other things. H was found to have more than 1 ounce along with a set of ultra high precision scales and drugs bags.<br />He was a dealer, the shame of being in a family with criminals was great but the evil little shit got his just deserts for lying to me.<br />The prison sentence was only 1 month which was suspended for 6 because it was a first offense. I thought that this was weak but was pleased to here when he lost his job, his car and his family.<br />Pity he did not have a house to lose but he did get thrown out of his current address and wound up living in a bad neighborhood along side his own ilk.<br />Now I hear that he is jobless and in the gutter shooting heroin.

				Wow, you read the whole 8 pages Mr Fluffles S. Hmm, if DVDs mail-dropped then it would unsolicited, which unfortunately people (like me) immediately correlate that to previous instances; like spam or Jehovah&#039;s Witnesses. But..... internet would not only be cheaper but get around the door-to-door salesman thing that people have with free information. I like the idea of WikiLeaks without the crap on the front that makes it hard to sift through. (I have visited the site twice but never read anything.) Think of how you&#039;ve been changed by a hard-hitting documentary. For the kind of money required it would be better served convincing established people in media than doing it yourself. (Talk back radio programs always generate a good deal of free publicity; some can really roll with it if they&#039;re opinionated on an issue.) <br /><br />Don&#039;t want to dampen your spirits though. A single DVD could convince somebody to flesh it out and run with it. The great thing about activists is that they&#039;re prepared to do something as a project, rather than for money. The bad thing about activists is that they&#039;re prepared to do something as a project, rather than for money. They can help with some things but certainly not bankrolling. The idea of having to personally raise capital in order to get a message out is unnecessary. And don&#039;t forget that if it&#039;s quite bad, a mere 30 second clip of police brutality sometimes has more effect than an hour-long session with Dr Sigmund Freud. That&#039;s how we know of the continuing racist brutality against blacks from the LAPD. Dumb fucks don&#039;t seem to get the message that if you go around targeting and beating ^ black people on tape, it gets broadcast in 180 languages around the world and never dies down. (Or white people.) <br /><br />If this is about an unbiased, &quot;both-sides&quot; story/doco on drugs, hmm.... when have you known broadcasting agencies to be impartial? So yes, I agree it would next to impossible to air this on a professional commercial platform.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9529.msg713282#msg713282">Quote from: Mr. Fluffles Schrodinger on January 09, 2013, 06:51 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Statistics about taxes spent on the drug war vs education etc. could also be really influential to public opinion.&nbsp; <br />Logical facts about medicine needed would strike home with a lot of people, too. <br />Use their &quot;what about the children!?&quot; attitude against them. <br />It would have to be really good though, I&#039;m sure there is someone around that&#039;s perfect for the job.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Like Alex Jones?

And he&#039;s right, it could be done. Guess the question is not if it could but if it should. I certainly don&#039;t have sympathy over a couple of pigs shot here or there when they do the exact same thing to society. Society keep forgetting that LE are criminals too, they just get away with it. Would I myself shoot a cop? Hmm, well I guess if he annoyed me while watching Simpsons...... nah I don&#039;t know unless I was actually put in that position. But rest assured I don&#039;t like the motherfuckers. I don&#039;t like bullies. I don&#039;t like hypocrites. I like girls and ice-cream and Simpsons.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely.
