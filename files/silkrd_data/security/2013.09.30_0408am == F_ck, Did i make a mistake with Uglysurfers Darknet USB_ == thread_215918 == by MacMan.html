				If you&#039;re paranoid you could simply create your own Darknet USB. The bootable Whonix tutorial in my signature does pretty much the same as the USB stick you bought. It may be even more secure as it uses Whonix for the virtual machines.<br /><br />I assume you boughts this:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1858539732

				My opinion: There are a million ways it could be full of evil shit, but I really, really doubt it&#039;s US LE.<br /><br />Think about it backwards, from their perspective.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#039;s make a USB stick, full of stuff that let&#039;s people communicate anonymously, but we&#039;ll backdoor it, so we&#039;ll know who they are and what they do.&nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, so far, this sounds great from their perspective.<br /><br />But with the constraints we can surmise from the FH malware incident a few months ago, LE can&#039;t get a judge to just let them spread malware to the world (yet) just in case it helps them catch something &quot;bad&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;In that case, they had a *clear* link that users using the FH sites&nbsp; were viewing CP.&nbsp; &nbsp;And what they apparently got the okay for was to ship very careful malware that just pinged info back to them, only on a subset of clients.&nbsp; And based on the fact that the exploit didn&#039;t even work on *current* versions of the Tor Browser, you can guess that it took them a while to get the okay.&nbsp; &nbsp;Too long to be truly effective.<br /><br />So in the case of your USB stick, their request looks like: &quot;We have no idea who&#039;s going to buy this, and we can&#039;t prove they&#039;re going to be doing bad things with it.&nbsp; We just know they&#039;re buying it from SR, which is chock full o&#039; evil shit.&nbsp; Can we backdoor it and sell it and see where it leads?&quot;&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that makes the hurdle from an oversight perspective, and I damned sure don&#039;t think any boring assed middle manager in LE is going to say, &quot;Yeah, what a great use of our resources.&nbsp; We might accidentally catch some people&quot;.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think your worry is from LE.&nbsp; Which means there are two explanations why the seller is selling &quot;Darknet USB&quot; sticks:<br />1. Jimmy Wannahack thinks he can make an super-eleet USB stick.&nbsp; He wants bitcoin.&nbsp; Presto, he&#039;s all crypto-munitions-dealer and shit now. <br />2. Somebody wants to backdoor it, and if they&#039;re not LE, they&#039;re wanting a way to monetize it.<br /><br />#1 above is mostly harmless, except Jimmy Wannahack is almost certainly not be quite as bright as he thinks he is, and I wouldn&#039;t trust a stranger with my security.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t, either.<br /><br />#2 is the one you oughta be worried about.&nbsp; The two obvious ways to make money from you using my evil USB stick would be to either skim your credentials to SR and other places, and find ways to use those to steal bitcoin, or to gather enough personal information about you to extort cash from you.&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; &quot;I know you&#039;re Person X, and you did these five Evil Things.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gimme cash.&quot;<br /><br />You should:<br />1. Go get something you can trust to use, even if only temporarily.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t feel like going through any of the decent tutorials here on how to build Whonix/etc systems, at least go get a copy of Tails and copy it to USB.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />2. Once you&#039;re not using that darknet USB craziness, go change every fucking password you have, everywhere.<br />3. Sit down, pour yourself a beer, and try to make a list of everything you did while using the darknet USB.&nbsp; See what you can do to address any other exposure you may have.<br /><br />And if you used that darknet USB on a laptop that also had *your* hard drive in it (i.e. your normal, Joe Blow everyday laptop), consider that malicious code on that USB could have dug through those files on the hard drive (unless the HD had full disk encryption), and it could have planted malware on the hard drive itself.&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;d use dban or something similar to wipe that hard drive and reinstall it.<br /><br />You&#039;re much better off with using a tutorial here, or using Tails than you are trusting a stranger to provide &quot;security&quot; for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s no magic in the world, and Jimmy Wannahack or whoever is making USB sticks on SR doesn&#039;t have any secret ninja tricks.&nbsp; He&#039;s doing the same shit you see in tutorials here, and possibly skipping a few steps.<br /><br />It does make me wanna see a copy of one of those USB sticks, though.&nbsp; If anybody has one that they&#039;ve never used, posting a &quot;dd&quot; of it somewhere would be awesome.&nbsp; If you have one that you *have* used, you&#039;d be an idiot to post it though, because there&#039;s no telling if it had your personal info already buried in it.<br />

				The moment you type in your account info and pin number to buy something, say good bye to your BTC.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen reports on multiple vendors who sell tech equipment/guides (pdf files), saying they lost all of their btc after installing/using said equipment. Bunch of malicious software you will never find with any sort of scan. These SR vendor-hackers are pretty damn smart.
