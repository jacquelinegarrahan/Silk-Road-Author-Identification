				Hello there my friends! I just had a quick question about how safe my images are.&nbsp; When I upload a picture of some nice drugs to my computer, usually I open up the picture then ill take a screen shot of the whole thing and cut out the portion of the screen shot that I need and repaste it and save it as a new file.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was just wondering if there is any further precautions I need to take before posting? I know this is a n00b ass question but I just wanted to double check my securities before I started posting photos with what could have my name written all over them, while thinking that I am 100% secure.&nbsp; Thanks for all your help my friends I greatly appreciate all of your help! :D

				I understand that one method of stripping out any data is just to open the file then save it as a .bmp in paint and use that image file.

				if u have photoshop.. Do a save for web and devises. Make sure u have NO META DATA clicked. save as u with it will be opt for the web and not contain anything that may be incriminating. If u still are concerned. Do a get info in photoshop&#039;s file menu towards the bottom of the drop down and look at all the empty tabs where data is SUPPOSED to be. U can throw some in as well like FUck u copper thanks for looking at pics of my drugs while u are at work salivating over my drugs i am at your house fucking your wife and eating your food and drinking your beer!<br /><br />HIGH!!!<br />

				As you suspected, taking a screenshot does the exact same thing. Tails has a metadata removal kit preinstalled. But like with image resizers, it&#039;s really only useful if you need to do a bunch of files at once.
