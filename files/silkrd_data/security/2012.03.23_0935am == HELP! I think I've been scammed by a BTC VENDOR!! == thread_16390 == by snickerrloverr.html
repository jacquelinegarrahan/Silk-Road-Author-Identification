				NEWBIE here and I purchased bitcoins for the very first time...I placed an order and sent my MP # to BTC PAL over 12 hours ago and I have yet to hear anything back from him! I even seen people leave feedback after I placed my order. How long does it usually take for an order to be processed? Has anybody every successfully purchased from this vendor? And i&#039;m wondering...if you can only leave feedback when you finalize your order...can&#039;t vendors just delete your order before you get to finalize to leave negative feedback?

				LOL...calm down there little buddy. Completely normal and BTCpal is VERY trusted. Unless he randomly decides to make a run for it (which is possible but not likely) and grab as much $ as he can. He is a well established BTC vendor whom I personally have given $400 MP cards before and he came through with ease and perfection. Patience young grasshopper is a virtue that comes in quite handy around here. :)

				Dealing with BTC always requires a bit of patience. As with most things on the internet, there&#039;s a lot of processing on multiple ends that takes place. 12 hours doesn&#039;t sound like a reasonable time to wait before jumping into panic mode.<br /><br />Just calm down, wait a bit longer, and keep this thread updated to let us know how it goes. Good luck!

				BTCPal is legitimate. My last trade with him took ~24hrs and the one before that took a few days, which was expected since his page explained that he was backed up with a long queue of orders. He even wrote me a message to apologize for it taking so long and said the next time would be faster--and it was. Fortunately, I wasn&#039;t in any sort of rush. <br /><br />The MP exchanges often seem to take a bit of patience. Don&#039;t worry, though. I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll come through.
