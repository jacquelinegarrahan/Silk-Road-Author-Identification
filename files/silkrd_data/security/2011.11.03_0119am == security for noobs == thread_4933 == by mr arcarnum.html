				Expert users usually don&#039;t answer this kind of lazy thread. You have to search for info.<br /><br />But, just the basic, that&#039;s all I know:<br />Don&#039;t use the hidden wiki link to came here;<br />Look for your seller feedback on SR and the forum;<br />Just send your address and personal info for your seller using GPG (encrypted message);<br />Don&#039;t send your money directly from your wallet to SR, use multiple instawallet and a new identity on Tor for each transaction to wash it (I send to an instawallet, wait a couple of hours to anonymise, send part of the money to another wallet, and other part to another one, than I sand to more 2 wallets and finally to silkroad. Also change your silkroad bitcoin account for every transfer);<br />If you will track your order on internet, don&#039;t use Tor or another anonymous proxy. Go to a cybercaff√©;<br />Don&#039;t expose any personal data that could be traceable to you at forum;<br />Don&#039;t talk about silkroad on instant messengers, phones social networks, even in private talks/rooms;<br />Use a linux liveCD/liveUSB distro or, at least, encrypt all your hard drive (clean the free space sometime, maybe you will want to delete your wallet);<br />Always keep your Tor updated.<br />Wait a couple of days before to open the package. If you are under a controlled delivery, the cops will visit you soon;<br />Search for more information about this topics, mainly GPG, controlled delivery, instawallet, Tor (on silkroad foruns and other places);<br />If the cops knock on your door, DENY ANYTHING. They have to prove you are guilty, you don&#039;t need to cooperate. It will not help you in anyway. Think about some plausible deniability and say you don&#039;t know anything about the package. Ask for a lawyer immediately.<br /><br />If you follow these recommendations, you will be much safe than the simplistic thought &quot;oh, it&#039;s Tor, so it&#039;s safe&quot;.<br /><br />But, like I said, I&#039;m not a specialist in security.

				You&#039;ll find that for many of us this is an ongoing question.&nbsp; What I suggest you do--and what I did just recently myself--is in the Security fgorum--this one--go to the beginning and read thru.&nbsp; There are different schools of thought, in all areas, some believe running a virtual machine is best, and there are good instructions on how to set this up.&nbsp; Others, like me, prefer live distros oinn a flash drive, and sometimes I&#039;ll do regular tor on a flash for forums, and Tails on flash for main stie, for reasons that should be clear to you.<br /><br />And on live distros there is much debate: lately, many prefer liberte linux and I myself have tried that, and also privatix, but I prefer Tails for different reasons, but it&#039;s all arguable.<br /><br />PGP, you need to learn how to encrypt and decrypt.&nbsp; could start by getting GnuPG4win, and there are many threads showing how to use this...<br /><br />How to receive mail: basically two schools of thought: whether it&#039;s better to hide as much as poshersible, fake i.d., and p.o. boxes, or whether should use your own name, as that is more likely to arrive, and actually less supicious...read up on shipping...<br /><br />Mostly common sense....and don&#039;t get lured into foolish behavior, like buying btc from new sellers...let them hang around a while, and prove themselves...lately there&#039;s been a run by scammers on newbies wanting quick btc...<br /><br />Yeah, lots to study: we all had to do that...

				If it&#039;s possible, use a deposit to get your bitcoins.<br /><br />Use fake data in your bitcoin exchange account, if they ask. Access the exchange by Tor or, if it&#039;s not possible, by a VPN like hotpost shield or JAP (everything related to silkroad/drugs on internet, is better use Tor or a VPN to access).
