				So, that doesn&#039;t seem to raise red flags. First class mail directed to &quot;Current Resident&quot; always gets delivered. Can anybody here argue why we should give our real name to a seller?

				AFAIK, most of the mail going to &quot;current resident&quot; is bulk junk mail or something similar. A plain looking envelope with a sample of something or some LSD tabs may get through, but I wouldn&#039;t risk a box, bubble mailer, etc being shipped to my house under &quot;current resident&quot;. Just use a believable fake name if really don&#039;t want to give yours out. If your name is John McMahon, use something like &quot;Bill Kelly&quot;. A Mark Sanchez could use &quot;James Lopez&quot; or something like that.

				If you know it&#039;s coming in a letter/small package that will be delivered to your mailbox, so anything not very big, go ahead and use a previous owners name. I get old tenants mail constantly, so many names, even after some years. However, if you use a fake name, and you get a missed delivery note, or the package is too big for your box, you&#039;ll be SOL though.

				We were once &#039;considering&#039; offering and printing some very &#039;generic&#039; looking bulk/junk mail, &quot;current resident&quot; style envelopes (the kind with the two small transparent windows that &#039;everyone&#039; gets). And at the time, thought it wouldn&#039;t be too much of an issue, unless the Postal Inspectors ever caught on. As most &#039;bulk/junk&#039; mail have registered accounts with USPS (for bulk postage, ect.).<br /><br />Just something to consider, even as a buyer. It might fool a postman...but...<br /><br />Our only concern is now that &#039;party favors by mail&#039; is becoming more &#039;mainstream&#039; (and publicly available) that they &#039;might&#039; (VERY) easily use the address scanning technology that USPS has been using for YEARS, to scan n&#039; pic (and possibly store in a massive government database which they could then proceed to use super-computers to do traffic analysis on?) [If they aren&#039;t already?]. EXACTLY like they &#039;have&#039; been doing for over 5 years with every license plate of every car that drives around Washington D.C alone (and many other sates as well), for example. And that very same technology was originally invented by USPS way before then. So just sayin;.. ;)<br /><br />It&#039;s probably best to switch up both your &quot;receiving&quot; and &quot;sending&quot; methods (whether buyer or vendor). Switch up your names, packaging/shipping style, fonts, return addresses, drops, color&#039;s, ect. Who know&#039;s what there doing with that technology? &#039;We&#039; sure as hell don&#039;t! So we tend to err on the side of caution.<br /><br />But all that aside, we&#039;ve still NEVER even had an issue with &#039;anything&#039; domestic being delivered to &#039;Current Resident, or even with &quot;no&quot; name, just an address. Although this is NOT &quot;advice&quot; WHATSOEVER, obviously. Just experience. ;)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TFC<br />

Makes sense, if they are looking for patterns then disrupt the patterns.<br /><br />Another technology that scares me is advanced facial recognition software. For the buyer, it could be done while making cash deposits for BitCoin and for sellers it could be at the post office mailing packages. If you use Google Picasa you might have seen the faces it automatically thumbnails from every photo you have. They&#039;re great for things like smartphone address books and online avatars but the potential for LE use is enormous.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s why most vendors drop (or better yet, have partners drop), not at the Post Office, but during varying times of day or night, via car, bus, taxi, bike, and bit of walking (regardless), wearing different clothes, hats, sunglasses, ect, each time, and NEVER bring ANY cellphones they may have with them when doing so, or when accessing any other &#039;sensitive&#039; sites. Then just dropping into an ever changing number of blue boxes.<br /><br />This is how I used to do it when I was shipping, and the &#039;basis&#039; of what we require of our re-shippers now. There&#039;s &#039;plenty&#039; of other &#039;add-ons/tricks though.<br /><br />There are also plenty of ways to get btc without smiling for the camera&#039;s.<br /><br />Also, please understand my comments on the USPS scanning technology are purely &#039;speculation&#039;, but still a VERY real possibility, ALL based on &#039;facts&#039; alone. Whether or not they are actually using this tech to do such things? Who knows? But I feel it&#039;s pretty safe to assume if &#039;my&#039; perma-fried mind can conceive of such a possiblity, I&#039;d imagine other &#039;authorities&#039; world-wide most likely have as well. Why &#039;wouldn&#039;t&#039; they?<br /><br />Take it or leave. We&#039;re gonna &#039;take&#039; it for now. ;)<br /><br />So ALL the more reason for vendors to switch up return addresses EVERYTIME. If you are concerned,&nbsp; perhaps you could (at least) request a specific return name/business name from your vendor? <br /><br />All it takes is one &#039;friendly&#039; buyer that just so happens to be &#039;friendly&#039; DEA. Then they have a scope on your current, &#039;general&#039; shipping location. Times that by the scanning tech + re-using return addresses&nbsp; = ...well. I hope with this PSA we&#039;ll never find out. ;)<br /><br />IF they were using this tech, then every time you re-use an address, &quot;if&quot; your flagged (and again, all it takes is ONE &#039;friendly&#039; buyer), then ALL mail using that return address &#039;could&#039; be stored at the very least. And most likely auto-tracked using a super-computer. Or 100. Regardless is most likely vendors that sell in large amounts that TRULY must to be concerned about these things. Which we don&#039;t. Yet we would just still rather not to have anything related to us or our customers be stored on ANY government database. ;)<br /><br />SnailMail for OSX is a GREAT freeware program for printing envelopes, ect, allowing one to use a rotating list of return addresses, as well as a simple ability to change fonts, sizes, ect, even...just in case I&#039;m right about the scanning theory, changing fonts/sizes as well shoudn&#039;t hurt. Again, they&#039;ve been (secretly) doing it for 5 YEARS with the plate tracking tech, all of which gets stored and analyzed daily on massive government databases. So. Yeah...<br /><br />But for most domestic buyers, receiving smallish amounts to their home address should be just fine using various fake names, &#039;Return to Sender&#039;, ect. We were truly surprised to find so much advice here suggesting (and vendors encouraging) orders to be shipped under your REAL name?!? We disagree. HIGHLY. For many reasons. All explained with a quick search. Of course on larger orders, ect, then the fake name/ID should be 100% in full effect. And beyond.<br /><br />In our opinion. And our ridiculously phun 10ish years of &#039;online-&#039; experience. And &#039;experiences&#039;... ;)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TFC<br />
