Silk Road does not, as far as I know, provide users with the option to log on using the YubiKey.

				Shabang,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This is very interesting. *ALWAYS* interested in new ways to enhance security.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/71ce6c1c96<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So this would replace a typical login?&nbsp; Or would it supplement the present login system?

				Using a Yubikey is part of a process known as &#039;Two Factor Authentication&#039; which combines two things; something you know, which would be your password, with something you have, which would be the Yubikey.<br /><br />Rather than replacing the standard login, it adds to it. You need to enter your username and passphrase as you normally would, as well as activate the Yubikey to send a &#039;One Time Pad&#039; single-use code to be verified in order to sign in. If you don&#039;t know the password, or don&#039;t have the Yubikey in your possession, you can&#039;t sign in, significantly reducing the chances of unauthorized access to your account.<br /><br />

				Yubikey is a 2 part authentication method. Easy example is let&#039;s say your password is HotSexyHoes. Not sure on yubikey, but I own a ironkey which also has same technology. It&#039;s called a one time password. When you login you would have to enter your known typed password, HotSexyHoes &amp; the yubikey will also generate a 6 digit number one time password that you have 30 seconds to use. So you would enter HotSexyHoes123456, where 123465 is your random 30 second password generated by your token key.<br /><br />I would LOVE to see SR implement this. However it is not without a downside. If you were ever in trouble with the law &amp; they did confiscate your yubikey &amp; tie it to your SR act, that would be bad news bears.<br /><br />I personally own a ironkey which has the same technology, i believe they are just licensed with verisign. It only works with verisign enabled sites, which i&#039;m sure SR would never be apart of, so I would have to have 2 keys which is kind of a pain in the ass, but I may do it as extra security is never a bad thing.<br /><br />You know what I also thought about as well is with the purchase of my new lenovo laptop is that it has a built in finger print reader. I haven&#039;t got it to mess with it yet, but you guys think that would be a good idea or bad idea to have your fingerprint tied to your SR account. I was thinking 2 factor authentication, like password + fingerscan. I think you have to support the correct libraries for it though &amp; i&#039;m not sure if SR does.

If they used the same authentication server as a number of other projects, it would be a whole other story. Another issue is that SR will have to (I believe, someone please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) send out keys to everyone that have been pre-configured to authenticate with SR&#039;s own server.
