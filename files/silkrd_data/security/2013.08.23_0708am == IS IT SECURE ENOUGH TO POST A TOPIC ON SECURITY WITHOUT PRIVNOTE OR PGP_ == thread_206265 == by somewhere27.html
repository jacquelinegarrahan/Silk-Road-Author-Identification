				I am just as paranoia as T.S.<br /><br />But let&#039;s stay with the facts.<br /><br />No it is NOT enough to use privnote only.<br />Even when privnote uses the tor onion encryption.<br /><br />When privnote shares the same destiny as tormail, you should expect that all you wrote without encryption of gpg will be read. If you have given your real address , you will be added to the list.<br /><br />The bigger amounts will have priority.<br />When it&#039;s obvious the purchase was meant to sell again.<br /><br />Only when it&#039;s for your own use, clearly, you have a chance to stay out of L.E.&#039;s hands.<br /><br />@t.s., you do not have to smash your pc.<br />&nbsp;Just click the &quot;&quot;out&quot;&quot; button on the upper right.<br /><br />It takes just a few seconds to get all data off again.<br /><br />Never use windows, always TAILS and you should be safe.<br /><br />Those who have no option, should use something as &quot;&quot;true-cript&quot;&quot; to keep their data safe.<br /><br /><br />Or with hardware, mount the hdd at the bottom and place a deGausser under the hdd.<br />In fact a electromagnet.<br /><br />You should end up with a hdd that has been used by &quot;Killdisk&quot;&quot;.

				You have to make a threat and in it tell people to PM you with their public keys so that you can encrypt the privnote message and privnote URL in order to display a thread. Otherwise they will abduct you in the night.
