				Say the police intercepted or ordered themselves a package from SR.&nbsp; Do you think they would dust the inside of package and outside envelope for fingerprints? I am in UK and i personally think thats too much hassle for them. I may be wrong though.<br /><br />For those concerned about leaving prints en route to post box....instead of using clear latex gloves try putting them and a normal plastic bag and get yourself one of those large paperclips, like the ones that are attached to clipboards.....have them all clipped together in the bag, take them outta the bag holding onto the clip and then dump them in post box holding by clip and release, walking away from post box and no prints on envelopes.

There is an old thread around here somewhere written by a former PO employee that states that is exactly what they do.

				U.S. here<br /><br />The outside of a package I think would not be able to be counted as anything once it has entered the postal system. It becomes &quot;compromised&quot;<br /><br />The inside. Couldn&#039;t tell you, but I would imagine a good lawyer could get the idea that it was &quot;compromised&quot; when it was opened. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t go putting finger prints all over your packaging tape. ;)

				Personally, i use Freshly opened Yellow latex gloves ( like the kind pussies use when cleaning ) and then roll the thin white plastic gloves over my hands ( Helps avoid any possible arm hairs falling from your fore arm into the product, or package. And is a very good way to protect your hands from cross contaminating packages. ( But always wash the outside of your Vac sealed bags once everything is sealed. Kills the microscopic particles that may have gotten on the bag from any possible contact between bag and product. ) <br /><br />But to answer your question. Im sure they would dust inside, and i dont think that once its open its &quot; compromised &quot; because unless a postal worker opened your package and didnt take what was inside, noone elses fingerprints could possibly be inside ( if there is even any at all in the first place ) But it never hurts to be too careful

That seems like about the most obvious thing in the world to me. They will dust the outside as well, there is a little something called an intersection attack. If pack one has fifty peoples prints on it and yours and pack two has fifty peoples prints on it and yours, if the fifty people are different they can intersect the crowds and narrow in on you as the person who likely shipped both of the packages.

I wasn&#039;t the one that asked. To each his own, but I feel there is a fine line between security and paranoia. <br /><br />1/2 the people here will suit up to the gills in a latex contamination suit to package their product....... and then get in their car, drive to their LOCAL post office. Show their face to a camera (hell probably a couple of them) then walk up to the counter acting like an ebayer and buy priority shipping with a DCN. <br /><br />No proof the DCNs are tracked as to who bought them, but hell of a way to link your face to a unique string of numbers. Yeah! ...lets do that twice a week.
