				Hey would like to know what the best pgp program is for Mac, I&#039;ve not been able to run anything that makes any sense to me at all. All I really need is a public key that i can send and retrieve messages on. I couldn&#039;t even find the clipboard let alone figure out what the actual key I need to post on to my profile...Had it all worked out with my PC but yeah, any experienced mac users please help, any videos/links appreciated, I don&#039;t want to spend a lot of time on this so the easier the better. Thanks.

				Please notify me as well when you have this problem resolved. I am having difficulty using PGP with a MacOS whilst all of my PC friends are basking in PGP glory.

				&nbsp;&gt;:(This dose not help ???<br />I spent allot of time getting the GPG system installed on my computer, and getting my favorite vendors saved on the the GPA system.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not want to use the igolder because I want to be able to do it on my OS system.&nbsp; I can not find any where to type a message and have it be encrypted, i.e. clipboard or TextEdit. If anyone has got the GPG to work on the MacOS system could they please help us noobs out :-\<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t really bother with MAC and PGP. <br /><br />I tried to get them working together but to no avail. I just installed parallels and installed a Windows operating system and ran PGP from there. <br /><br />It&#039;s a lot more secure through a virtual machine which is what I use day to day when visiting sites like SR and communicating via PGP.

I use PGP with my Mac and it works beautifully. Download the GPG Tools at www.gpgtools.org. There&#039;s an installer. Has a great UI for managing your keys. Integrates well with Thunderbird and Mail.app. Easy to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Then to decrypt: Command, Shift, D, and the Decryption menu comes up.<br />I must say that once I figured out how to use the GPG system on the mac I would pick it over the Windows based GPG software.
