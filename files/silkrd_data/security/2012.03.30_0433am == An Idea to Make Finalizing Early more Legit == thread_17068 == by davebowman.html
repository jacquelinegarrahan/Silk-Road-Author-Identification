				This idea just occurred to me and is no way practical yet, but I would like to see what people think. <br /><br />As of right now, finalizing early is a matter of trust and a way of building reputation, and while some people prefer to go through escrow, this can be tedious for sellers who are shipping their packages on time and have to wait to get paid. <br /><br />I was thinking that finalizing early would not be a big deal if vendors could somehow prove to their buyers that their package was actually ready to ship, and was being kept only until finalization. The only way this could be accomplished is if vendors photographed the sealed package with the buyer&#039;s address information visible, and was able to securely send that photograph to the buyer before he or she finalized. The photograph would then be destroyed just as their pgp address information is destroyed.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about image encryption but I don&#039;t see why it would be impossible to encrypt a photo with a personal key the same way text is encrypted in pgp. The main issue this would resolve is the concern that some vendors ask their buyers to finalize early and claim they will ship immediately, only they still haven&#039;t even bothered making up the package and might wait days, if not weeks before doing so. I realize that vendors could simply photograph an empty envelope with an address written on it, but I figure in some cases it may be better than nothing. Without naming names I will say that even some trustworthy vendors with good reputations do misrepresent the haste with which they ship packages after requiring some of their customers to finalize early.<br /><br />I realize this would take a lot of work and would not necessarily make that much of a difference, but if anyone thinks of anything that would improve this idea please respond.

				This idea would work in a utopian society.. however.. we wouldn&#039;t even need something like this if everyone was honest because an escrow wouldn&#039;t be necessary. <br /><br />I see one major flaw in this idea: the seller could bypass this system by simply not taking the package to the post office.<br /><br /><br />I like the thought nevertheless.<br /><br />Zeus.<br />

				I already photograph all packages in case of disputes so this would be good way to get paid on time rather than having thousands in escrow and no money to reup

				Gummy Stars posted pictures of his packing materials as proof that he was ready to ship...didn&#039;t mean anything. Just because you have a package with an address label and stamp on it, doesn&#039;t mean that you put anything in it and took it to the mailbox.

You have to put trust into the vendor when you FE. I&#039;m not a vendor but, i understand why certain vendors would prefer you to FE. (They don&#039;t wanna have their money tied up.) But, at the end of the day. Unless the vendor uses DNC. You don&#039;t know for sure if they have shipped or not. There is a lot of trust that goes into ordering drugs through the mail. Lol

				A better idea to make finalizing early more legit: Don&#039;t do it, ever :p<br /><br />There are few worse feelings than being ripped off. Not only do you lose your money and have nothing to show for it, but you have to live with the knowledge that someone is out there throwing around money that they stole from you. I&#039;ll never understand why anybody would finalize early, I will especially never understand why anybody would finalize early with a vendor that does not even ask them to. I get that people want to reward their favorite vendors but this is just a dangerous and irresponsible practice. If you want to help out a seller you like, shoot them the occasional tip and leave them great reviews. Make posts on the forums recommending them. Don&#039;t go out of escrow. It will most certainly bite you in the ass one day, and you can look forward to a great deal of depression and anger as a result.

Do not FE for any reason(s). You don&#039;t know what the fuck can happen. For instance this was just on the forum (i&#039;m new as well &amp; read this) where a vendor is/was MIA, people were saying everything from he was in a accident &amp; in the hospital recovering to busted to dead. Anyways, more than like 5 people had placed orders, i.e. money in escrow &amp; after a month never received packages. They did resolve option &amp; SR admin gave everyone FULL refund, not just a partial, because vendor wasn&#039;t even able to respond, for unknown reasons.<br /><br />You never know what can happen to an individual. Shit can &amp; does happen in real life. It&#039;s not that a vendors intention may be to ever rip anyone off. If they get busted with 50lbs of pot &amp; 30 packages ready to mail, uhh... duh ain&#039;t no one getting shit. I mean medical accidents can happen to anyone anyday &amp; it could be days, weeks, or months before hearing from that individual again, if ever, shit they could die.<br /><br />I personally am only placing large orders &amp; do not want my money or any other people&#039;s money i handle disappearing, as said by blackend, don&#039;t do it EVER!!! If you want to be nice, leave a nice detailed forum thread dedicated to them, throw them a 5% tip or something.<br /><br />But in the end it&#039;s your own damn money, do what you want/feel comfortable with. Me personally &amp; blackend, won&#039;t be FE for anyone, lol.
