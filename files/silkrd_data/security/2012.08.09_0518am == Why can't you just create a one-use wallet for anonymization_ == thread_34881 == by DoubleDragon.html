				Let&#039;s say you want to transfer bitcoins from address A to address C, and you want to make it impossible to prove that you were behind the transaction.<br />What if you create a new wallet with address B, transfer funds from A to B, then from B to C, then destroy the wallet with address B forever and erase any trace you ever had anything to do with it.<br /><br />Knowing that address A belongs to you, can anyone prove that it was you who made the transfer to address C?<br />Can&#039;t you just say you purchased a Hello Kitty badge from some random person in Second Life, you&#039;ve got no idea what he did with the money afterwards?<br /><br />Why wouldn&#039;t this method work?

				Because I assume it wouldn&#039;t work since people seem to be rather sending their coins through a laundry with a 3% commission rate before transferring to address C.<br />So I am curious why. ???

				because you can not &quot;destroy&quot; a bit coin address and all bit coin transactions are visible via the block chain.

				But those are only string sequences without any additional information, no?<br />So if you destroy the wallet associated with the address, how can someone prove you ever had anything to do with transactions initiated from that address?

You technically can&#039;t prove you owned Address B, but the correlation is pretty damn obvious. It becomes more obscure if you buy $10 in bitcoins and $5.81 goes to address B, then 2 weeks later $2.91 goes to address C, then 3 weeks later .... But in the end they can still match up all the $10. Remember every transaction is stored, the source and destination will exist forever in the blockchain.<br /><br />It&#039;s like if you go to the ATM and take out $400, then get accused of doing a $400 drug deal, you&#039;re damn stupid if you don&#039;t think the ATM records would be brought up in court as evidence against you.<br /><br />SR&#039;s storage wallets aren&#039;t that hard to trace down, so if they see $10 go from A-&gt;B-&gt;SR Wallet a week before you got some drugs in the mail, it isn&#039;t going to help you that&#039;s for sure. Proper bitcoin mixers have large amounts of funds from various users that make the trail much harder to follow, but you still need to deposit/withdraw differing amounts, don&#039;t deposit 100 BTC and withdraw 100 BTC immediately even in a mixer like bitcoinfog.

While the legality of having bitcoins in SR is legal grey area, the real problem is that it would show you did deposit enough money into the SR marketplace to make your order(s).

				I disagree with the whole paranoia. <br />What LE knows and what LE can prove are two different things. <br />Even if they know that all the addresses in the chain are yours they can do fuck all unless they can proof it. <br />So unless you buy BTC with your real name link to it then transfer it directly to some undercover LE for drugs, you should be ok.<br />Of course leaving a large BTC trail to your name could lead to more investigation&nbsp; of your person but the actual BTC transactions could not be broad up as evidence.<br />
