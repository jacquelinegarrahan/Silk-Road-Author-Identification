				Depends on what, how much, and whether they suspect you&#039;re supplying and whether they think it&#039;s small time or you&#039;re in on something big. You might get a letter or a visit from the police, just deny, deny, deny.

				I&#039;ve had an order for 1/4 gram of H that should have been here a few days ago, from Canada. I&#039;m starting to worry customs stole it from me, it&#039;s been 9 days now. I doubt it&#039;s a large enough amount for them to worry about, but still. How should i know if they took it or not?<br /><br />(Maybe it&#039;s just the old junkie in me worrying obsessively like this. But an order from CAN from the opposite side of the continent made it in 5 days.) Everytime I open my empty PO Box, I feel a sinking dread that says for certain &quot;It&#039;s not going to come, stop checking&quot;. :/

Not really sure about this.

				It&#039;s doubtful the package had any tracking for an amount that small. If customs did snag it, you&#039;ll EVENTUALLY receive a love letter but that can take a few months to process.

				&quot;Love Letter&quot;-- I hear this so often. What exactly do they say in the letter they send? (I obviously don&#039;t believe it&#039;s full of love :P )

				A &quot;love letter&quot; refers to a letter from customs stating that they have seized something of yours with reasonable cause and lets you know how to appeal it if you would like.&nbsp; Within the US, customs has not been sending out these letters nearly as often so don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t get one.&nbsp; Customs will keep your product for a certain period of time before they burn it.
