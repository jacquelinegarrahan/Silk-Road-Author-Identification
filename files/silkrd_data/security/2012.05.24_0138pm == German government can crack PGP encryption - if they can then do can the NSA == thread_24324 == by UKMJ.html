				Hi UKMJ,<br /><br />I have just read the original German article* - the important word here is &quot;teilweise&quot; - i.e partly!<br /><br />The question was framed by a German Politician in general terms and a generic answer was given that it is indeed possible to monitor encrypted communications depending on the type of encryption and encryption strength.<br /><br />The article makes for an interesting read but I don&#039;t see any reason to pack up and go home just yet. <br /><br />Firstly, this is hardly big news. We&#039;ve known for some time that older ciphers like 3DES and 1024 Bit Public Keys have been vulnerable to brute force attacks.<br /><br />Secondly, you&#039;ll see the BND have declined to comment on the exact methods used to intercept communications for fear of malicious people being able to defend against it. If a consistently viable way to crack PGP had been invented, using the evidence in a public trial would be tantamount to an admission of the same.<br /><br />As such even if the NSA have managed to find a way to break open our e-mails, do you really think they&#039;ll show their entire hand for the sake of a few kilos of drugs?<br /><br />V.<br /><br />*Deutsch ist geil! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24324.msg256493#msg256493">Quote from: UKMJ on May 24, 2012, 01:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">German article ran through google translate:<br /><br />http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.golem.de%2Fnews%2Fbundesregierung-deutsche-geheimdienste-koennen-pgp-entschluesseln-1205-92031.html<br /><br />Not sure how much of an issue this is given that SR users tend to only send addresses for delivery encrypted by PGP, it could lead to customs love letters or interceptions, potentially controlled deliveries for larger orders.<br /><br />Of course it may not be worth the processing power to crack every PGP message just to get a delivery address for a gram of cocaine or 3.5g of hash but the risk is there.<br /><br />Just a heads up for my fellow travellers on the road.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Truly cracking RSA is one of the holy grails of cryptography.

The government in my country asked Charles Babbage not to publish his solution to the Vignere Cipher (the so-called &quot;unbreakable&quot; cipher!). Similarly after the war we supplied our former colonies with captured German Enigma machines, the encryption for which we&#039;d been cheerfully breaking throughout the war.*<br /><br />As we said though, if you were in the German government&#039;s position would you risk revealing that information in an open trial for the sake of a few drug dealers or keep it a secret and spy in your country&#039;s enemies?<br /><br />V.<br />*For the purists out there, yes there was more than one type of machine and no we didn&#039;t break Nazi naval encryption.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				oh boy. dont really know where to start here :D<br /><br />first: german law enforcement is extremely incompetent in all internet/computer regards. they had a personal malware program to spy on computers of people they where investigating, which opened up backdoors any 12yo russian scriptkiddie could abuse for even worse stuff they used the program for. mostly because there was no proper encryption between the CC server and clients and you could easily attach worse payloads and code to any infected machine. when it went public, they became the laughing stock of the whole german speaking internet. not just because their terribly written malware was violating pretty much every legal basis they got for using it in the first place, but mostly because of the circumstance what a giant piece of shit software it was.<br /><br />second: golem.de is a tabloid newspaper for nerds. very bad source for information regarding computer stuff. <br /><br />conclusion: hold your phones. especially if the german goverment boasts with such circumstances in public and nobody else is really reporting it besides a nerd tabloid, its probably even mostly made up on behalf of the germans. <br /><br />if i have more time ill sum up the whole deal with their really bad malware for all you non-german-speakers, it was/is really funny :D

				Thanks everyone for your comments, I really should not have sensationalised that title by adding in the bit about the NSA by the way.<br /><br />Thanks vladimir for the translation, the google one is average at best.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t think anyone would use it against SR specifically because there is little value in buyers addresses, but security is security so I&#039;m glad I posted it.

				If you can please post the full article in this thread.<br /><br />&nbsp;as far as I know, NSA doesnt share information with any other agency. So you have to be classified as a national security rick. I&#039;m sure this applies to&nbsp; some, but not most of SR users.

				Quantum computers can pwn RSA with Shors algorithm. Quantum computers have already been used for prime factorization just against really small numbers. A quantum computers ability to pwn RSA is dependent on the size of the key versus the number of qubits the quantum computer has. Real cryptographers are worried about quantum computers though, and the number of stabilized qubits is indeed growing at a steady rate. I have heard that RSA with realistic key size is probably going to be dead within a decade or so. Bit for bit ECC is significantly stronger than RSA, although it is still weak to quantum computing attacks, it requires significantly more qubits to pwn ECC based algorithms than RSA, bit to bit. There are public key encryption algorithms that are so far immune to quantum computing, traditionally they have had very large key sizes and very large ciphertexts (measured in megabytes instead of bits) but I believe there are some other quantum resistant techniques that have more practical parameters. Merkle hash tree signatures are quantum resistant, and there are quantum resistant multi-variable quadratic PK crypto schemes&nbsp; for signatures and session key encryption, also goppa code pk schemes that are quantum resistant. NSA currently suggests using elliptic curve PK crypto, they don&#039;t even include RSA on their list of suggested algorithms, but it is still thought to be secure against all but quantum computer attacks once you get to ~2,048 bit keys.&nbsp;
