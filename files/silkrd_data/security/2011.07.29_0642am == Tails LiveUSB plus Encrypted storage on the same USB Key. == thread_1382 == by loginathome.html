				These instructions assume that you are using Linux to write the files.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t, you should be.<br />This will show you how to create a flash drive with tails, custom apps, and Encrypted Storage on the same key.<br />If you are Using Tails Live USB, these instructions will greatly simplify things. <br /><br />You&#039;ll need a USB Key (USB Flash drive...) that is greater than 2GB<br /><br />This is pretty skimp on the details, so just ask and I&#039;ll go into further detail if anyone needs help.<br /><br />1)&nbsp; &nbsp; Download unetbootin.&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; &nbsp; Use this to write the tails CD image to the flash drive.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Boot the flash drive to make sure it works.&nbsp; <br /><br />3)&nbsp; &nbsp;now, using gparted or other partition manager, shrink the partition as far as you can.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing is ever saved there, so you can shrink it all the way.<br /><br />4)&nbsp; Create another partition of 512MB or something.&nbsp; I used 512, its a good number, can&#039;t image why you&#039;d need more.<br /><br />5)&nbsp; Search the internet for portable linux apps.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember where they are, but I trust your google fu.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; find truecrypt and put it on the second partition.&nbsp; Also put whatever else you want.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; Format the third partition to be whatever you want, you are going to encrypt it with truecrypt.&nbsp; It really doesn&#039;t matter, as truecrypt is going to format it later.<br /><br />Now you can boot tails, which will never save anything within the OS.<br />You have an unencrypted place to store stupid stuff that doesn&#039;t need to be encrypted.&nbsp; Such as any apps you want as well as your wireless keys and what not.<br />and an encrypted place place to store everything that is sensitive.&nbsp; Like your PGP keys and the address of Silk road.<br /><br />Easy.&nbsp; (although you kinda have to know how)<br />I used an 8GB microcd card, and it works perfectly.&nbsp; <br />(Also it can be swallowed if necessary....)<br /><br />I (re)wrote this cause I see so many people complaining about the lack of storage in Tails, even though it is (to me) a relatively simple thing to make work.<br />I hope that this helps someone out until Tails includes storage options.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m going to have a go at doing this. Do you have a USB adapter for your microsd or do you have a card reader on your pc?

				I&#039;ve been trying very hard to get this bootable on my macbook, but have had no success at all. I tried installing refit to no avail. I also read that unetbootin works well, but can&#039;t make usb drives bootable on mac. This is driving me insane. Anyone have any insights they&#039;d care to share? Thanks.

				I now have Tails setup on my 4gb usb flash, the partitions are as follows:<br />700miB for the live image, (i shrunk it down after using unetbootin as recommended)<br />50miB ext2 for Trucrypt portable<br />3GiB for my encrypted partition. Here i store keepassx, pass database, pgp keys, etc<br /><br />The only issue I&#039;ve had is that trucrypt has to be run as root to work properly.<br />I do a sudo nautilus, browse to the directory and run it. That way there are no issues mounting the encrypted partition.<br /><br />Thanks loginathome!! Great idea!&nbsp; 8)<br />

You&#039;re right, all traffic is encrypted. However if you make a new virtual NIC, instead of NAT&#039;ing, you have that extra layer of a manipulated interface. You can make two NIC&#039;s and bond them :D<br />Proxy them out twice, BNC them somewhere...make it HARD for LE. ;)<br /><br />My thoughts are similar for Ubuntu, which I run with VMWare from time to time. I used to use it primarily for what I have my live USB key for now. OS logging as we know cannot be shut off entirely, but having it all to yourself - including control over the network interface - is a nice feeling.<br /><br />~btcf~

				@ lucymucy<br />I started off with a similar thing. I had a truecrypt file container with portable virtual box inside. I ran a VM from there (xubuntu).<br />Having experienced both:<br />Tails live is much quicker, (running a Vm is always a little sluggush I find) and it has system wide proxy so everything goes through Tor.<br />Give it a try!&nbsp; ;D
