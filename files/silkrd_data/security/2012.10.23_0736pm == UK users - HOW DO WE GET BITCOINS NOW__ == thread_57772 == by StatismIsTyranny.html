				Hi&nbsp; SR<br /><br />&nbsp;I was going to place an order today for the first time in a month or so and I noticed to my absolute horror that Mt Gox is no longer accepting UK bank transfers as their bank has stopped the account. I looked on Intersango but as I expected they still aren&#039;t accepting UK bank transfers either (since their account was closed a couple of months ago). It seems the high street banks are declaring war and boycotting bitcoin, which is a dick move IMO.<br /><br />Now I am stuck. These were the only two proper bitcoin exchanges I am aware of available to UK users. Mt Gox is still accepting bank transfers, but to a bank in Japan with a 1000&nbsp; yen (£8) fee&nbsp; + 2%. Your bank may well place an additional heavy fee when you do the transaction, I do not know. SR is already expensive enough without this added horror, so it kinda rules it out for me and probably most people as I often send small amounts of money to me BTC exchange wallet.<br /><br />I notice Mt Gox accepts money from a service called OkPay, but charges a 1% receiving fee, and OkPay charges £4 for receiving wire transfers in GBP, and as I assume they are not in the UK, so your bank may charge heavy fees when the money leaves the account that I&#039;m not aware of. If there is nothing else, it may very sadly be the only option for getting Bitcoins in the UK, but it is a real disaster as SR is already expensive enough. They also require some pesky identification and verification of identity thing before they allow you to send wire deposits.<br /><br />So, aside from this, has anyone in the UK found any alternative ways to affordably buy bitcoins? How are you getting your bitcoins at the moment, UK customers?<br /><br />Regards<br />SIT

				You can send paypal-paypal to me. Not sure about fees, but I use my paypal for other stuff so I don&#039;t care so much.<br />People ruined that. I could help out anybody without scamming, oh well: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=57716.0<br /><br />I would just do a wire transfer after the paypal has been confirmed, then wash the btcs and send it to your sr, or other account.<br />For a 1% fee by my, and if required, a 1-3% fee from another site.<br /><br />Totally up to you.
