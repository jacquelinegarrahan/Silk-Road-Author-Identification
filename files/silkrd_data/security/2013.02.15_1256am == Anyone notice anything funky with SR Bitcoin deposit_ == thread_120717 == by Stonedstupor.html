				Not so sure if i should be saying this, but i just logged onto my SR account to see 15 grand just sitting in my account. i did a deposit today for not near that much but in my account history the deposit was credited like 8 times from same address. i did a blockchain search on the address the deposit came from, and it shows nothing more than what i deposited originally. what the hell? <br /><br />hopefully this is my lucky fuckin day<br /><br />Edit: 21k now..

				Someone just got a thread started over here too:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120716.0<br /><br />Having the same exact problem. Deposited today. Have 6 times more than I should. Blockchain is telling me the same thing and saying the only deposits to that address were the ones I made.<br />Don&#039;t know whats going on but must be an SR problem. Hope for a staff update soon!<br />Maybe we got lucky?!? lol. Valentines day gift?

				No, it&#039;s no coincidence.&nbsp; I spoke with DPR and he pulled the site immediately to give himself and the staff time to fix the glitch.&nbsp;

				is it only with some vendors,&nbsp; or is it a bitcoin or SR glitch?<br /><br />How do you know if you have been affected?&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed my account &quot;creep&quot; upwards a little over the past few weeks, but only a few dollars e.g. &lt; $8 = roughly 10% of what was in my account but I&#039;, new here and still dont have a good understanding of how this bitcoind values seems to &#039;float&#039; as much as it does? <br /><br />&nbsp;Has this &quot;glitch&quot;&nbsp; affected everyone&#039;s accounts?&nbsp; I just had a deposit go through and was busting to make some purchases .... and this&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Oh well, I DO appreciate the care these guys take with the phenomenal job they do, so I wish ALL The Good Pirate Robert&#039;s team the best at getting this sorted asap<br /><br />Peace love and happy dreams&nbsp; :)<br /><br />motek <br /><br />ps. any idea how long the sites gonna be down?<br /><br />

				This issue just started this evening/tonight, and you&#039;d notice because your wallet would be multiplying every 10 minutes by the amount you deposited --- but today only.&nbsp; It&#039;s just an SR glitch, NOT a bitcoin glitch.

				The good news is that I&#039;m guessing they can kind of roll things back to a point before this glitch appeared.&nbsp; Not sure, but I do know for sure that most of what was going on did not involve actual bitcoins.&nbsp; So, everything should be fine and easy to fix.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Hopefully it&#039;ll be back up soon for everyone.&nbsp; I think DPR stated that it&#039;s coming back up for people on a rolling basis.
