				Is it secure to access Tor and SR without closing other computer programs?&nbsp; I&#039;m mainly thinking of ones that access the internet (web browsers, email, music players etc).&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering whether having another browser open would somehow compromise security.<br /><br />I have read the &quot;complete all in one guide&quot; and will try to use that in the future, at least when ordering

				So the super short answer is &quot;yes.&quot;&nbsp; The longer one is &quot;sort of, but only a little.&quot;<br /><br />For a buyer, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; The biggest risk I think is accidentally trying to log in to an account in the wrong browser and boom, sending a DNS request for silk road&#039;s address to your ISP (which doesn&#039;t sound good -- &quot;hi, where do I find illegal drugs please -- redirect me plz&quot; is just silly even if it isn&#039;t logged).<br /><br />Or trying to log in to, say, MtGox and getting your account frozen because you accessed from Tor.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; Human error that probably will happen eventually if you aren&#039;t super careful 24/7 (and nobody is, so you have to come up with a way around that -- two monitors?&nbsp; One on each monitor... that&#039;s what I do, and I haven&#039;t fucked up yet anyway).<br /><br />The longer answer is that it does make it easier for specific attacks against the Tor network to identify you.&nbsp; How much easier I can&#039;t tell you, but they&#039;d have to want to find you pretty bad to even bother trying, so as a buyer I don&#039;t see it as a risk.&nbsp; Well, it is, but it&#039;s a risk I take myself -- put it that way.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be so cavalier if I faced 30 to life if caught, though.
