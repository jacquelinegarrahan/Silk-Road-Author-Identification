				Greetings everyone, I just want to make a swift public service announcement and show you folks why your factual name and address should never be used.<br /><br />A few weeks back I ordered a certain item from a certain vendor, however I did not have it sent to my actual address. At my apartment complex we share &quot;PO&quot; type boxes. I happen to of &quot;found&quot; a copy of the master key. Having this allows me to use any name and address located in that box, just as long as I check the mail straightaway after the mail man leaves. I usually only do this on items I don&#039;t really care about. This item however, I did it because I knew not to trust the vendor ahead of time.<br /><br />The past couple of days I have received communications, on and off the forums,&nbsp; from several different brand new accounts fashioned by our resident forum hero, HEATFan. These messages contain the address and name of a particulate jackass who I know works nights at a gas station and siestas all day. I have only used this name one time on an order, with only one vendor who I shall not name. These messages are an effort to worry and intimidate me. This forum user, HEATFan has hoarded the personal information of another individual who, quiet hilariously,&nbsp; is not I, and has admitted, in another forum post, to spreading it to other forum members, vendors, and calling the DEA/USPS/POLICE on a random address they can&#039;t be sure is me, claiming he &quot;linked me&quot; to a former scammer. I chuckle every time I get a message from this idiot telling me he called the local DEA. Honestly, sometimes I sit by my window at night, hoping to catch the moment the police kick in my asshole neighbors door, and shoot his loud ass dog. A giggle at the thought of Heatfan feeling victorious that he finally caught the evil villain, only to wake up the next morning and find a message from the person he most despises. <br /><br />Letâ€™s review<br /><br />1. As a vendor you should never use your real address or name, not even on a alt account. Get a virtual business office that receives mail for you. I have had one for a few months, and its great because you can put your &quot;company&quot; name on the package instead of your real one. Not everyone has a master key.<br /><br />2. As a user you should do the above mentioned.<br /><br />3. Never tell a vendor this is a fake address. Give them enough rope to hang themselves if they please. <br /><br />Assume every person you come in contact with is a gullible idiot who will eat anything you give them, because usually, they actually are.<br /><br />Now why did this certain vendor save my information? My guess is either A. Blackmail, or B. something to fall back on if he ever got arrested. Sadly for Heatfan and himself, I&#039;m not the dumb ass I lead on to be.<br /><br />Which leads me to my last point. Act like your stupid. It&#039;s the best method I know of, to find out who will really try and fuck you over, or be a decent person.<br /><br />PS: bitches be motherfuckin crazy am I rite?

				Actually I&#039;ll post one more thing. Like I said, the only person I PMed the address to (which I had originally gotten from Coachella420) was boostintoHYPERSPACE, your new alt vendor account. No messages were ever sent to InfiniteSource or MindBlower or Coachella420. None. Only a few messages were sent to boostintoHYPERSPACE, which you read. Then you came here and posted you read those messages from the InfiniteSource account, linking you 100% to boostintoHYPERSPACE. Do you think before you act? You literally incriminate yourself like I said.

You have no HARD link to me or any other vendor for that matter. I change everything. PGP version, grammar, i even alter photo information to fuck with you real hard lookers. Baby I got this sown up. Any &quot;evidence&quot; you happen to produce would be common among other vendors. I know this playground a little more than you, lover boy. <br /><br />Hey, what do you gotta say about me, 420, and blastintoHYPERSPACE all shipping from completely different places?<br /><br />Hurr durr.

				Why the fuck is this loser still in here yapping?<br /><br />I have&nbsp; already outed this moron and liar and thief.....and his vendor account is now .....GONE! LOL<br /><br />He CLEARLY is a total liar and not one thing he says can be counted on as true. <br /><br />@Heatfan...you need to stop even trying to defend yourself. Not one person is here believes him. NOT 1.&nbsp; He has been proven to be a liar and a scammer. So every single person agrees with you. In fact the ones that believe him...are his other accounts.<br /><br />Everyone has seen how I got this piece of shit lying dirtball outed. And although he is dead...he is like a snake. You cutoff the head and they still move. That is all he is doing. I cut off his lying head...and he is still moving. But that will end soon.<br /><br />Of course he says he has multiple accounts but then again...nothing he has said has been true...so this is probably anther lie. But if this is one of the truth things he has said...then if and when he tries to scam....I will expose that vendor account too and it will be gone!<br /><br />And of course I know he has multiple forum accounts...but who gives a fuck. At this point all of us know he is a liar and a scumbag and that will come out in his other forum accounts soon enough.<br /><br />

				Can i make a few accounts and just talk to myself on the forums all day and pick fights with people? <br />Its not against the rules. <br /><br />BTW, starting a vendors acct and then when you get orders just order from other vendors and leave your customers address info is fuckin dumb and dangerous and that should be breaking the rules and if its not i think it should be.

				&nbsp;It sounds like Infinite&#039;s asshole neighbor is actually Infinite... So you have his real address, congratulations.<br /><br />&nbsp;Its pretty obvious that this fellow thinks viable lies are just aw plausible as the truth... but the pattern becomes clear. The masterkey is madeup. The tormail messages are madeup. The accusations are convoluted. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;My favorite part was when Infinite insulted Libertas for believing his bullshit...&nbsp; and then tried to tell some more lies about the functionality and viability of reshipping services.... of which I can personally attest, there are services which will reship your mail to multiple countries as needed.
