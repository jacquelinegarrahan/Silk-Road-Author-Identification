				Iâ€™d like to know as well, but the standard response here seems to be: buy from a reputable seller and start small.<br /><br />cordiali saluti

				I personally don&#039;t ship to Italy, you guys have the most corrupted postal workers only 10% of my orders made it. At first I thought Italians were sneaky little scammers but I googled it and it seems like ebay/etsy sellers have the same problem. <br /><br />I would look for someone that has a good refund rate just in case.

				It&#039;s very simple...use your address but with a different name...could be someone who is living with you at the moment and is waiting for some mail...unless you live in a condominio...then i&#039;ll go for the real name...

				Italy is an exception to one of my rules, so is Russia. They share a lot more in common than weird pro-male-bonding presidents.<br /><br />That is use Standard Mail to increase anonymity set size. But the Italian postal system is rotten, you&#039;ve more chance of theft if you use standard mail.<br /><br />Thus, two things.<br /><br />1. Use the more expensive tracked delivery. This is also because even when they&#039;re not thieving, they&#039;re very slow.<br />2. Use a virtual office (google this). This will allow you to get what you want re: anonymity legally. <br /><br />
