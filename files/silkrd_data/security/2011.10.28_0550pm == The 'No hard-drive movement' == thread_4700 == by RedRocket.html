				hey boys ;)<br /><br />ive come bearing some of my ways :D<br /><br />im anti-hard drive, as some of you know...<br /><br />my mottos is....fuck thy hard drive.<br /><br />the real answer is simple, the answer is MicroSD...<br /><br />i can do everything i want to without a hard drive, i can play youtube videos flawlessly...if not better than using windows.....i can use skype to speak to very distant relatives with not one hiccup to this day...i can go into java based chatrooms and speak shit till my heart is content....all without a stupid fucking hard drive....and this is just the basics....<br /><br />i&nbsp; can also switch distros on the single microsd card that i use when it suits me,when im good...i can chose ubuntu or linux mint or a multitude of other distros<br /><br />or when im bad...i can switch to tails/liberte/privatix etc etc....<br /><br />if shit hits the fan,i can either swallow it or hide it inside the tiniest crevice.<br /><br />the possibilities are endless<br /><br />join me....burn thy fucking hard drive, it will only fuck you up the ass....in ways you would imagine were impossible<br /><br /><br /><br />

				if you can get an operating system onto a microsd card, you are ten times more ahead of the person that only encrypts there hard drive to &#039;beyond military standard&quot;....on condition that you know how to get rid of a spec of dust.lol...IN MY OPINION...so yeah,IN MY OPINION, you are apart of the ELITE if you commit crimes via live distros on a microSD card...there is none above you ....how does that make you feel?lol...to be the best of the best???<br /><br />to encrypt your microsSD is yoda knowledge

				You do realize that the microsd is essentially a hard drive, right? You&#039;re still storing data on a non-volatile medium.<br /><br />Sure, it&#039;s a little more portable than a 2.5&quot; SSD - but it&#039;s the same damn thing except slower. Protippity - Truecrypt your shit regardless.

				yeah i realise that,becuase its the only medium i have....it sure as hell feels like a hardrive!!!&nbsp; only difference is,its only the size of my pinky nail.....<br /><br />at the end of the day, it is all about portabilty...theres no way in hell u will be able to get rid of a real hard drive if the pigs comes crashing thru.....but with a microsd...theres hope...and alot of it!!:)

				yea, i get it... you can swallow a microsd easier than you could a 2.5&quot; SSD - but I know some chicks who could swallow that too if yah know what I mean. honestly, it doesn&#039;t matter - if LE is coming after you and all they&#039;re riding on is snagging your data for a successful prosecution the judge probably won&#039;t even sign it. you&#039;re gonna be fucked regardless.<br /><br />there is a headless windows 7 install that can boot off of a 8gb (32bit) or 16gb (64bit) if one doesn&#039;t want to figure out linux. but if you&#039;ve gotten this far you&#039;re probably intelligent enough to tackle something as simple as a lightweight debian distro.<br /><br />why you think i&#039;m leo btw? because i pointed out that what you&#039;re using is just a scaled down hard drive? really tho, why do you care? not like i can do anything about you if i were.

				lol I like redrockets way of speaking lol&nbsp; I&#039;m going for the whole low profile &quot;look&quot; so took all my&nbsp; pgp and tor and all that crap off my computer wiped all my freespace with like a 7 pass wipe and stuck it all on a usb.&nbsp; Now here Red comes in with the frickin microsd card! DAMN you red, just DAMN you lol!<br /><br />what size micro are you using?&nbsp; I know I have a 16gig laying around from one of my tablets.&nbsp; The other poster mentioned a headerless windows 7 which can operate from a micro, care to explain this more?&nbsp; Like is that somesort of warez windows7?&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine ol Mr. Gates allowing his retail version of windows 7 to become portable, but hay that&#039;s just me

				Good thread! :)<br /><br />I agree that if they&#039;re after me, it&#039;ll be something I&#039;m *not* paying attention to...more than likely it&#039;ll be some beautiful young babe dea agent chatting me up in the pub, and me wanting to show off what a wise motherfucker I am, than thru tor liabilitities.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mostly I operate on theory that you shore up as much as you can: try to keep HD clean of anything to do with TO pursuits.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t use vm, tho I see the advantages of going down that road.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always liked xpud and puppylinux and such ... if anybody is familiar with google&#039;s latest: chromebooks, where Chrome is the OS...all the OS is just the browser...then to me, xpud is linux&#039;s version of the chromebook.&nbsp; <br /><br />But on here, as stated, I like using Tails or Liberte Linux or Privatix.&nbsp; I think any one of them is good enough.&nbsp; Tails just keeps me &#039;honest&#039; because everything gets erased, and I&#039;m with RedRocket, and keep most stuff of interest in the cloud.&nbsp; I like Liberte better, after I used it a while, just found the browser irritating, but I&#039;ve gotten spoiled.&nbsp; I hope some other people check out Privatix...it was more of a hassle, the way I loaded it, burn to dvd: then use dvd to load to flash drive...<br /><br />Main thing about a linux distro, is if you get in the habit, of always going to some other computer to &#039;buy&#039; on main forum, keeps stuff distant, but I&#039;m not always a safe camper, so...<br /><br />Wish all my habits were as good as these: I&#039;ve stated before, that sometimes I fear I&#039;ll be real careful in one area, and kind of slack in another...haha, slack....got me dialing out on still *another* good flash drive linux distro, with tors, is &#039;slax&#039;: http://www.slax.org/&nbsp; and look for the &#039;Tork&#039; modules.<br /><br />I try to keep changing up, but keep it to the flash or pen drive...and even there, I keep it small, to 4gb drive, all I need, and like said, u can make it disappear in all kinds of interesting places... :)

				You could also set Tails (or whatever distro you&#039;re using) up in a virtual machine and run it on top of your existing OS environment.
