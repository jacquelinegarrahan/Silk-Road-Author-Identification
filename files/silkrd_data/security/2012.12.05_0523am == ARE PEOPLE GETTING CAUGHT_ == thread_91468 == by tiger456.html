				Over the past few months, I have used a bunch of vendors but have had trouble finding people as regular sellers, though I of course do have some, but many of those I have contacted or tested out have simply fallen off the entire site. For instance, the vendor USPS sent great stuff real fast and secure. There seems to be no reason for his sudden loss because he could make plenty of and steady money. Does anyone know of arrests being made? Is the State catching up with this technology?<br /><br />Stay safe,<br />Tiger

				Alot of vendors go stealth, take breaks, rename themselves.<br /><br />This is a very public platform.

				Exactly, if i was top of the food chain so to speak, i&#039;d leave for 2-3 months, return and start again. Gives everything a chance to cool down..

				Oh good point about the changing names. I guess that&#039;s pretty smart! USPS didn&#039;t scam me, but he just disappeared.

				If I had made like $10&#039;000 in the space of two months or so, I&#039;d have a break as well - Some vendors are raking it in big time, I know SuperTrips was before he went all retarted with his orders.<br /><br />As long as the reviews are solid, then you&#039;ll always have your favourite substance only ever a couple of days away.<br /><br />

				This is a great website to check on drug related arrests/seizures all around the globe.&nbsp; I have yet to see anything related to SR but I don&#039;t check it everyday.&nbsp; <br />This is a CLEARNET site: http://drugs.globalincidentmap.com/
