				Hi,<br />SWIM created a Tormail account and emailed a bunch of people SWIM knows letting them know that SWIM could ship various substances in small quantities to them. SWIM told them to create a new email account and get in touch if they are interested. They would have to send SWIM bitcoins. SWIM even helped them figure out how to get BTC anonymously. SWIM will place orders for them on SR and charge a fee for the same. SWIM plans on using a SR account that is brand new. SWIM will require a reference from a reliable customer to take on new clients. SWIM will offer refunds and reships on a case by case basis. SWIM&#039;s country of operations has very lax customs. Basically SWIM&#039;s clientele don&#039;t know about SR and are pretty bad with tech in general. SWIM will place all orders using PGP and will only make small orders. No big deals. There is no real life contact between SWIM and the clients. SWIM will not be using encryption on SWIM&#039;s computer and SWIM uses this computer for other stuff. Can anyone think of a way SWIM could get busted?

				Fuck swim, but you should be good to go. Might as well at least encrypt a hidden volume in TrueCrypt. It doesn&#039;t take hardly anytime, doesn&#039;t hurt performance, and makes you much safer.
