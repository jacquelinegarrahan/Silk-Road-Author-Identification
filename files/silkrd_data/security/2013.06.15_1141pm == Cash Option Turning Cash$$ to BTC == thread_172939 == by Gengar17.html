				I see a lot of questions about turning CASH into BTC on the forums, I was wondering if anyone has found an anonymous/semi-anonymous way to do it. <br /><br />I used to use BitInstant, and as sorry as they are I never had a problem with them. Now with the new website and the whole verification thing, I&#039;m sure a lot of people are wondering what the easy solution is (even if it involves BitInstant). <br /><br />It can&#039;t be attached to my bank account, and I&#039;d like to use cash deposit. Bitstamp seems to be pretty successful and works even though it&#039;s slow, so if anyone has any personal experience there I&#039;d love to hear about it.<br /><br /><br />Peace and love

				I use Bitstamp, their rates are usually a dollar or so different from Gox and cash transfers to your bank take days :)<br />Still better than Gox though :)

				Not to be a pest, but bi worked flawlessly and rapidly yesterday. Sent my order over TOR, cash deposit. No problems.<br /><br />Alternatively:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172799.0<br /><br />Jack n Hoff suggests Blue Sky Traders.

				Update: <br /><br />BitInstant did NOT work for me. As of today, they changed their site around so you can&#039;t even send currency to a BTC address anymore. I had a payment slip printed out and went to Walmart like I always used to do, and it denied my account # on the slip. I guess BitInstant is finally not an option for me, I&#039;m interested to see how my Cash/WesternUnion to BTC transaction will go with White Out. Will update.
