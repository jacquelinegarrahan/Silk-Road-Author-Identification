				Unless you are in Canada, I recommend one of those &quot;IBAN reloadable prepaid debit cards&quot;, usually VISA electron from a large Poilish bank (yes, I am selling those myself, but there are other vendors here I guess who also sell them).<br /><br />You can open an intersango.com account (they don&#039;t ask any awkward questions, no ID etc.), transfer your bitcoins to your account there, change (trade) them to EUR or USD (the fees are very low), then withdraw to your debit card and then withdraw cash via ATM using your debit card. It is really quite easy and straight-forward if you read the instructions carefully and follow them ;)<br /><br />IMO this is one of the cheapest and most secure (at least against scammers) method for small amounts. (you can only withdraw 150 UR or 200 USD per day via ATM, weekly limit 750EUR/1000 USD, yearly limit 2.5 times that I think).<br /><br />Be sure to order the correct card, they are issued in EUR, USD and GBP, if you choose GBP and withdraw USD (for example) you will have to pay additional fees and it generally just is more confusing regarding limits etc.<br /><br />Or, if this is too much hassle for you (though it should only be a matter of a few hours to buy the anon card, create the intersango account and do the withdrawals), there are trusted vendors around here who offer cash in the mail for your BTC, this will be faster I guess, but probably more expensive (after all, they also have to pay some fees and want some money for their work). Of yourse there are some who speculate on the BTC exchange rates and give you a really good price, but I doubt that currently.<br /><br />cheers,<br />sb<br />

				Bitcoin love - not sure why a vendor will want them, they will already have BTC they need to transfer into USD/GBP/EUR. Your best bet is to spend it on SR, sell to vkad1m1r or sell on mtgox.<br /><br />Spend on here and you get some drugs<br /><br />Sell to vlad and you may take a small hit<br /><br />Sell to mtgox and you will take a larger hit due to fees, you could try to cover this when BTC prices rise but they are at a peak right now so you may need to wait a week or two to make enough gains to cover your fees, however any fluctuations will leave you exposed to negative returns.<br /><br />Not sure why you are concerned re:security of mtgox especially if you are going to sell them and withdraw cash immediately. BTC is not illegal and currency speculation is common.
