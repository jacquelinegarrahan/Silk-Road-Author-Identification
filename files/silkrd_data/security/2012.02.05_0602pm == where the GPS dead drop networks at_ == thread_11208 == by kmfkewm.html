				SR has so many members that imo it is the perfect platform to introduce localized GPS dead drop networks. Vendors already leak their rough geolocation when they mail. If you live in a populated city you can probably find a lot of customers on SR who live near you. They would probably love to pick up their drugs from a GPS coordinate instead of get them via the mail. GPS is particularly good for bulk orders, and of course for localized orders. Dead drop spikes and GPS equipment are pretty cheap these days. The idea of a GPS scene has long been discussed but none of the private forums ever had enough members that they could be realistically implemented by us (not enough geographic concentration of members). SR could change that. Feel free to discuss the idea and security techniques that apply to dead drop networks.

				I am aware of one in the bay area although it is way above my playing level, and I imagine that of everybody else on this board save one or two people. A big problem is countersurveillance of the drop point, I am so paranoid that I would not want to work with a team when I&#039;m picking up large amounts of drugs for various reasons (trusting others, loss of anonymity, etc.) but it is very difficult scope out a drop spot alone and impossible to perform real time perimeter monitoring.

Fear at just how many genuinely bad people could be out there that the feds can&#039;t catch, and relief because I know I&#039;m almost impossible to bust.
