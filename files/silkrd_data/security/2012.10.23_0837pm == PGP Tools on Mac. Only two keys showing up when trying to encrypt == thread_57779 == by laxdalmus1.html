				I am trying to encrypt my address but when I right click and go into the service menu and click encrypt, PGP keychain access shows up as it should, but only two keys are there.&nbsp; When I open PGP Keychain Access as an application it shows the vendor public keys that I have imported.&nbsp; I have tried to reinstall the program but the same thing happens.&nbsp; The only two keys that are available to encrypt to are my own and GPG Tools Project Team.&nbsp; Vendor keys dont show up even though they are definitely imported.&nbsp; I am running Mac OS 10.6.8 which may contribute to the problem as I saw in multiple other threads.&nbsp; Can anyone help me solve this problem?
