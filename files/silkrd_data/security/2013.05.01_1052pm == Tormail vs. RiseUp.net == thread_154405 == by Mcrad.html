				Hey guys, just wanted to do a poll on tormail vs. riseup email services, <br /><br /><br />riseup doesnt use a .onion URL. though RiseUp uses a&nbsp; setup where you must either know 2 members already using riseup, or submit a small paragraph on why you would like to be a part of the riseup community. which was brought the question into my mind...<br /><br /><br />WHICH IS ACTUALLY SAFER?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />(safety is my main concern as it should be with all my fellow roaders) <br /><br />

I recommend Tormail, especially because the location of the tormail server is unknown just like SR. So it makes it less likely to be seized for LEO to be able to view the contents. And hopefully they use full disk encryption on the server anyways. But no matter what...use PGP to encrypt any sensitive info or any information that may identify yourself.
