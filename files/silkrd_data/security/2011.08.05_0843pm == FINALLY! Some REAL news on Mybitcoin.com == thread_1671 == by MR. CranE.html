				So, just out of sheer hope, like I&#039;ve been doing several times a day since the disaster, I tried accessing mybitcoin.com today. It actually came up and not only did it load there is some pretty good news there. Here is the letter that is posted there. I just copied nd pasted it. <br /><br />&quot;Thursday, August 4th, 2011<br /><br />From the desk of Tom Williams, operator of MyBitcoin.com<br /><br />For immediate release.<br /><br />As you have probably noticed, MyBitcoin.com had been down for almost a week due to an unfortunate event.<br /><br />On Friday of last week we noticed that one of our pooled holding servers was missing a large amount of Bitcoins. After a prompt investigation we realized that the security of our SCI (Shopping Cart Interface) system had been breached by an unknown attacker.<br /><br />Our response was rash, but necessary. We simply switched the system off until we could have system-wide forensics performed. The forensics took some time, as the system is quite complex by nature.<br /><br />After weighing all of our options, we have realized that we have no option but to go into receivership. We will settle all accounts with a online claim process that we are currently in the process of working out.<br /><br />We will release more detailed information about the security breach, the claim process, and our balance sheet in the next few days.<br /><br /><br />Tom Williams&quot;<br /><br />See for yourself, just visit mybitcoin.com<br /><br />From the looks of it we may actually get some or all of our BTC back. Even though they have yet to return this news has more than made my day so I figured I&#039;d share it with you guys. Stay hopeful people. Have faith that good karma will pay off to those deserving of it :D<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				LOL, there are 3 other threads that posted the message. Try looking in the mybitcoin thread. Im glad that things are looking a lot better for those that have money tied up, but its always a good idea to search a little before making a new thread....(not trying to be&nbsp; a jerk, btw.) it doesnt make sense to have 3 threads about the same thing..
