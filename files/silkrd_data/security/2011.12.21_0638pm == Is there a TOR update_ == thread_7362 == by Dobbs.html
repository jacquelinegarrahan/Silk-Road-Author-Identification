				The privacy of Tor users could be exposed by the attack because the previous version of the software used the same Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate when connecting to different Tor network relays. An attacker who has identified the user’s client key could use the Tor network’s protocols to probe relays to see if the user’s key was connected to it. “Each client or bridge would use the same cert chain for all outgoing [Onion Router] connections until its IP address changes,” wrote Clark, “which allowed any relay that the client or bridge contacted to determine which entry guards it is using.” <br /><br />Read this here:&nbsp; http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/tor-project-patches-critical-flaw-in-its-anonymizing-network.ars<br /><br />I went to the TOR website and couldn&#039;t find any mention of an update.&nbsp; What do you think?
