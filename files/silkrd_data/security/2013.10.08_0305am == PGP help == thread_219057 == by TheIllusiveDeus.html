				hey guys i&#039;ve been using PGP for almost 6 months now but i don&#039;t understand how to decrypt messages. I&#039;m using GPG4WIN&#039;s GPA (GNU privacy assistance) and when I C&amp;P the message I received to the clip board and clicked decrypt it says: &quot;Clipboard&quot; contains no valid encrypted data. Tried to find the answer on the clear web to no avail. I&#039;m sure i&#039;m doing something stupidly obvious so can anyone help out? This is very important. Much thanks!!

As I pointed out to another poster security is NOT retroactive -- you can adopt proper procedures but you cannot make up for security lapses in the past. As I said, DPR is the poster child for this -- he made some rookie mistakes early on, and he&#039;s going to be paying for these for the rest of his life. <br /><br />I&#039;ve just spent a few minutes going over your posting history on the Forum -- you revealed your username on the SR site proper -- now the authorities can link everything you wrote here on the Forum about illegal drug use with anything you may have revealed in PMs on the main site. If you didn&#039;t encrypt your address previously, and you wouldn&#039;t be asking how to use PGP if you did, then you&#039;re already screwed. You&#039;re trying to close the barn door long after the horse has bolted. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090 <br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
