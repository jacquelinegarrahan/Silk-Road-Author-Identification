				Nothing impossible to crack. Only not been known done YET.<br /><br />Privnote is *NOT* safe because at any time government can seize it and make honeypot and you not know. Use privnote you put security trust into 3rd person hand. This not smart. :o<br /><br />Use GPG. Take 30 seconds more and keep you 30 years more free!

				I love PGP and think more people should use it more of the time. <br /><br />But, if you were at the point where classical computers were devoting an entire gigabit to an encryption key (which is pretty ridiculous) then there&#039;s no reason the quantum computers wouldn&#039;t themselves have register sizes of one gigaqubit, in which case the quantum computer will make as short work of your gigabit encryption key as it would have your 4096-bit key. <br /><br />And don&#039;t think it&#039;s impossible: http://esciencenews.com/articles/2013/06/28/large.scale.quantum.chip.validated<br /><br />However, the more people use PGP the harder it will be for systems like ECHELON to organize/filter/categorize the content that they filter.&nbsp; Many people think ECHELON simply targets &#039;keywords&#039;. However, based on patents filed by various government agencies you can assume it is *much* more sophisticated than that, for instance rudimentary &#039;language recognition&#039; patents as well as &#039;topic classification&#039; patents.<br /><br />Under construction by contractors with top-secret clearances, the blandly named Utah Data Center is being built for the National Security Agency. A project of immense secrecy, it is the final piece in a complex puzzle assembled over the past decade. Its purpose: to intercept, decipher, analyze, and store vast swaths of the world’s communications as they zap down from satellites and zip through the underground and undersea cables of international, foreign, and domestic networks. The heavily fortified $2 billion center should be up and running in September 2013. Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital “pocket litter.” It is, in some measure, the realization of the “total information awareness” program created during the first term of the Bush administration—an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans’ privacy.<br /><br />But “this is more than just a data center,” says one senior intelligence official who until recently was involved with the program. The mammoth Bluffdale center will have another important and far more secret role that until now has gone unrevealed. It is also critical, he says, for breaking codes. And code-breaking is crucial, because much of the data that the center will handle—financial information, stock transactions, business deals, foreign military and diplomatic secrets, legal documents, confidential personal communications—will be heavily encrypted. According to another top official also involved with the program, the NSA made an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users in the US. The upshot, according to this official: “Everybody’s a target; everybody with communication is a target.”<br /><br />…<br /><br />In the process—and for the first time since Watergate and the other scandals of the Nixon administration—the NSA has turned its surveillance apparatus on the US and its citizens. It has established listening posts throughout the nation to collect and sift through billions of email messages and phone calls, whether they originate within the country or overseas. It has created a supercomputer of almost unimaginable speed to look for patterns and unscramble codes. Finally, the agency has begun building a place to store all the trillions of words and thoughts and whispers captured in its electronic net. And, of course, it’s all being done in secret. To those on the inside, the old adage that NSA stands for Never Say Anything applies more than ever.<br /><br />…<br /><br />The data stored in Bluffdale will naturally go far beyond the world’s billions of public web pages. The NSA is more interested in the so-called invisible web, also known as the deep web or deepnet—data beyond the reach of the public. This includes password-protected data, US and foreign government communications, and noncommercial file-sharing between trusted peers. “The deep web contains government reports, databases, and other sources of information of high value to DOD and the intelligence community,” according to a 2010 Defense Science Board report. “Alternative tools are needed to find and index data in the deep web … Stealing the classified secrets of a potential adversary is where the [intelligence] community is most comfortable.” With its new Utah Data Center, the NSA will at last have the technical capability to store, and rummage through, all those stolen secrets. The question, of course, is how the agency defines who is, and who is not, “a potential adversary.”<br /><br />…<br /><br />According to Binney—who has maintained close contact with agency employees until a few years ago—the taps in the secret rooms dotting the country are actually powered by highly sophisticated software programs that conduct “deep packet inspection,” examining Internet traffic as it passes through the 10-gigabit-per-second cables at the speed of light.<br /><br />The software, created by a company called Narus that’s now part of Boeing, is controlled remotely from NSA headquarters at Fort Meade in Maryland and searches US sources for target addresses, locations, countries, and phone numbers, as well as watch-listed names, keywords, and phrases in email. Any communication that arouses suspicion, especially those to or from the million or so people on agency watch lists, are automatically copied or recorded and then transmitted to the NSA.<br /><br />The scope of surveillance expands from there, Binney says. Once a name is entered into the Narus database, all phone calls and other communications to and from that person are automatically routed to the NSA’s recorders. “Anybody you want, route to a recorder,” Binney says. “If your number’s in there? Routed and gets recorded.” He adds, “The Narus device allows you to take it all.” And when Bluffdale is completed, whatever is collected will be routed there for storage and analysis.<br /><br />According to Binney, one of the deepest secrets of the Stellar Wind program—again, never confirmed until now—was that the NSA gained warrantless access to AT&amp;T’s vast trove of domestic and international billing records, detailed information about who called whom in the US and around the world. As of 2007, AT&amp;T had more than 2.8 trillion records housed in a database at its Florham Park, New Jersey, complex.<br /><br />Verizon was also part of the program, Binney says, and that greatly expanded the volume of calls subject to the agency’s domestic eavesdropping. “That multiplies the call rate by at least a factor of five,” he says. “So you’re over a billion and a half calls a day.” (Spokespeople for Verizon and AT&amp;T said their companies would not comment on matters of national security.)<br /><br />After he left the NSA, Binney suggested a system for monitoring people’s communications according to how closely they are connected to an initial target. The further away from the target—say you’re just an acquaintance of a friend of the target—the less the surveillance. But the agency rejected the idea, and, given the massive new storage facility in Utah, Binney suspects that it now simply collects everything. “The whole idea was, how do you manage 20 terabytes of intercept a minute?” he says. “The way we proposed was to distinguish between things you want and things you don’t want.” Instead, he adds, “they’re storing everything they gather.” And the agency is gathering as much as it can.<br /><br />Once the communications are intercepted and stored, the data-mining begins. “You can watch everybody all the time with data- mining,” Binney says. Everything a person does becomes charted on a graph, “financial transactions or travel or anything,” he says. Thus, as data like bookstore receipts, bank statements, and commuter toll records flow in, the NSA is able to paint a more and more detailed picture of someone’s life.<br /><br />The NSA also has the ability to eavesdrop on phone calls directly and in real time. According to Adrienne J. Kinne, who worked both before and after 9/11 as a voice interceptor at the NSA facility in Georgia, in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks “basically all rules were thrown out the window, and they would use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy on Americans.” Even journalists calling home from overseas were included. “A lot of time you could tell they were calling their families,” she says, “incredibly intimate, personal conversations.” Kinne found the act of eavesdropping on innocent fellow citizens personally distressing. “It’s almost like going through and finding somebody’s diary,” she says.<br /><br />…<br /><br />Sitting in a restaurant not far from NSA headquarters, the place where he spent nearly 40 years of his life, Binney held his thumb and forefinger close together. “We are, like, that far from a turnkey totalitarian state,” he says.<br /><br />…<br /><br />Meanwhile, over in Building 5300, the NSA succeeded in building an even faster supercomputer. “They made a big breakthrough,” says another former senior intelligence official, who helped oversee the program. The NSA’s machine was likely similar to the unclassified Jaguar, but it was much faster out of the gate, modified specifically for cryptanalysis and targeted against one or more specific algorithms, like the AES. In other words, they were moving from the research and development phase to actually attacking extremely difficult encryption systems. The code-breaking effort was up and running.<br /><br />The breakthrough was enormous, says the former official, and soon afterward the agency pulled the shade down tight on the project, even within the intelligence community and Congress. “Only the chairman and vice chairman and the two staff directors of each intelligence committee were told about it,” he says. The reason? <br />“They were thinking that this computing breakthrough was going to give them the ability to crack current public encryption.”<br /><br /><br /><br />

				private note is safer then pgp because with private note while that information could be more readable then pgp, what it is being used for will never be known. it&#039;s browser based, and it&#039;s not stored on your computer. regardless of how you configure your virtual machines and computer set up someone could always go through it and find your keys. with private note, that&#039;s great you somehow can read the messages being submitted, but you cannot connect that to a certain computer. <br /><br />even if you didn&#039;t use tor with private note, your computer being seized means they won&#039;t be able to read the notes you submitted. with pgp, they could if they had to or got the password from you.

				Yeah and you might as well leave javascript enabled as well because it isn&#039;t like the police ever used javascript based exploits to deliver attack code to people viewing hidden services, for the entire life of Tor! well, other than the first time they did it. <br /><br />If you want your address sitting in plaintext on a server that can be compromised, that is your own risk to take. You want to be low hanging fruit go ahead it makes it better for everyone else because the police will target you first and if enough people are insecure like you they wont try to do more sophisticated attacks because the return on investment will be small. Just like they didn&#039;t try to pwn people using Linux or bother to use a zero day to bust the people going to freedom hosting. But at the end of the day you are taking a major risk that you don&#039;t need to take. And it is totally possible that some day that risk is going to end up with your address and what you have ordered logged in a police database. I am more happy that they just have uncrackable ciphertext, but go ahead let them get your address and orders as soon as they seize the server or penetrate it remotely.

It has been suggested that 1024 bit keys are vulnerable to cracking by an adversary with a lot of computing power, but its not a trivial task.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Add another bit and you double the number of possibilities, so a 1025 bit key will be twice as hard to crack. So a 2048 bit key will be 2^1024 times as hard to crack, which is a fucking huge number: 2x2x2x2x...(1024 times)......2x2.<br />So it is not expected that 2048 bit keys will be cracked any time soon, unless you believe that government agencies have computers 2^1024 times more powerful than those available to us.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most people here use 4096 bit keys which some might argue is overkill, but why not.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There are computers working on cracking PGP. And as members have said here many times before:<br />1024 bit keys will be crackable within the year and 4096 in about 20 years.<br />It is of coarse crackable, but takes a certain amount of time.<br /><br />Using a 4096bit key is ineffable.<br /><br />There are I believe 3 or 4 vendors who use 8000 plus bitkeys<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep true<br />But consider the future and supercomputers, and a network of combined computers.<br />Some Japanese showed who they cracked a 930 bit key in 148 days with 96 or 98 quadcore computers.<br />So I think there is no valid reason not to take the 4096 bit key.<br /><br />The keys could be revealed, if someone has access to your computer.<br /><br />The agencys have to do afford to see from who the key is, if there is no ipaddress attached.<br />Just a pity that your computer sends far to much info along with every connection it&#039;s making.<br /><br />The cpu (has a IDnumber) in cobination with your ram (brand , gb&#039;s etc) your hdd, the browser you are using, O.S. , and we have to assume that this info has been stored, next to your ip-address.<br />So even when you are not sending your IP, you still are sending other info.<br />&nbsp;Enough to get your ipaddress from a database.<br /><br />That said.<br /><br />We should never count on the encryption of just the tornetwork alone.<br />Your real home-address should be given in a 4096 bit gpg encrypted message always.<br />No matter if you leave your address on Silkroad itself, or when u are using privnote.<br /><br />You should use the gpg4usb, store your private key on your usb-stick too.<br />Use always a usb port at the front of your pc, so you can remove your gpg, incl the private-key.<br />So no acces is possible.<br /><br />Sites like privnote have the attention of the agency&#039;s.<br />Their reason for excistence is to get the info, what is not available to others.<br />If you are using privnote, you have most likely something to hide.<br /><br />Even when you are using the tornetwork, you should not be counting on the encryption on datatraffic , of the .onion-sites alone. Use GPG4usb and remove the usb after use. Thats why a usb-port at the front should be used. A port at the back can be forgotten,&nbsp; so leaving your usb for the hacker.<br /><br />A 4096 bit key, should keep your writings and files safe for many, many years.<br />Leave the default 5 years as a ultimate before the key will expire.

				I don&#039;t trust privnote.com even though it says the note is destroyed after its read that doesn&#039;t mean that the data is physically deleted from the server.

				Just pgp.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use anything else. I don&#039;t get why people treat pgp as if it&#039;s extremely complicated. I have my order encrypted within 5 seconds after I C/P the vendors key. It takes 1 command from the command line, and if you get it wrong, it aids you in the proper syntax.<br /><br />
