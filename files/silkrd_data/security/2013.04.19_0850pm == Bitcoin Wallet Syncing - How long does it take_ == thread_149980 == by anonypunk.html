				Well since a lot of the online wallets and exchanges are having problems I decided to use bitinstant with a cash to moneygram depotist to bit bitinstant to my bitcoin wallet on my computer. I checked blockchain and it was processed and is currently awaiting confirmation. I am assuiming this is because I used my bitcoin wallet on my system instead of an online wallet. My Bitcoin wallet is &quot;out of sync&quot; so how long will syncing take and will my money be deposited to my wallet after it does since it appears to be waiting in limbo. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

				Depending on your computer and network connection, it can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days.<br /><br />You can bootstrap the block chain with a torrent, which speeds the process along.<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145386.0<br />

				Thanks. I&#039;ll give it a shot because I had no idea that it would take so long to get it in my wallet and the wallet had to be synced for it to happen. Lesson learned I guess. I&#039;m just going to find another wallet service for future deposits. Does anyone use/know of a wallet that is anonymous to create, considered stable, and is secure?

				Yeah, your bitcoin-qt client won&#039;t know that it is holding coins until it downloads the block that contains the transaction where you sent them.<br />

				Or use Electrum. Takes about 10 seconds.

				So other than the first suggestion there really isn&#039;t a way to change settings to increase the speed of syncing then huh? And also I can&#039;t transfer them from my bitcoin wallet until it is synced and showing they exist right?

				You can extract the private keys from your wallet.dat, for example with pywallet, and transfer them to another wallet or service, such as blockchain.info. Look under the Import/Export tab and it will let you enter private keys, at which point that bitcoin address will be added to your blockchain.info wallet. From there you can transfer the coins somewhere else.<br /><br />http://github.com/joric/pywallet<br />
