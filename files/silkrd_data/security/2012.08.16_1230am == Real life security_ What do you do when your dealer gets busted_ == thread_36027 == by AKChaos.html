				I have made about 15-20 transactions with a meth dealer for amounts no larger than .5g at a time in about a year period. I found out he got busted recently threw public records. It shows that he is out on bail and he has called but ive been too worried to answer.<br /><br />Do you drop a deal completley if you know they are busted for a drug charge?<br />do you bring it up with them?<br />would LE even bother with someone like me?<br />should i alert friends of friends?<br /><br />Any tall tail signs and really any experiences are much appreciated. Im pretty scatter brained right now lol so sorry for the lack of organization =)<br /><br />Thanks alot!

				Depends.&nbsp; Depends on how much you know the person.&nbsp; And with the small amounts IK doubt you would be high on the list if he were to start setting people up.&nbsp; It usually goes UP the chain not DOWN the chain.&nbsp; but crazier shit has happened so YMMV.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had to change my number a couple times, they definitely go after the middle-man who has a lot of calls on record with the dealer, that&#039;s for sure.<br />Not much else you can do except lay low and be very careful.<br /><br />edit: Alert your friends, anyone who had contact with him, but do it in person and not over the phone.

				And remember, if an unmarked pulls you over and wants to bring you down to the station for a few questions: You know nothing, you ask if you&#039;re being detained (if not, you&#039;re free to go), if so get a lawyer right away and don&#039;t sign a fucking thing. That&#039;s it brother, good luck.

If they can&#039;t get to the dealer some police will settle for removing his clientele. Best to air on the side of caution my friend. In your case for all you know the police are watching him to see who he deals to.<br /><br />edit: F&#039;ed up quotes.

				Yeah I wouldn&#039;t take to the dude.&nbsp; A friend of mine was recently arrested for attempting to posses &gt;1lb of marijuana.&nbsp; Turns out his dealer got popped and set up the whole thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now if you&#039;re buying an lb you are probably going to sell some.&nbsp; If you buy a half gram of meth probably not.&nbsp; BUT better safe than sorry.
