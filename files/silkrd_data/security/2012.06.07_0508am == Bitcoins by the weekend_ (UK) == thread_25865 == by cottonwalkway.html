				I&#039;d personally try finding a vendor on SR that accepts a payment method you can use over in the UK.

If you do mtgox today they wont process it until monday.

				Hi Cottonwalkway,<br /><br />I offer a service here on SR selling Bitcoins to people in the UK in exchange for cash in the mail - one of the few ways of obtaining Bitcoins safely.<br /><br />My current turnaround time is two working days so if you do need BTC that urgently and want to obtain them safely I&#039;d suggest you either use Intersango and run your coins through a mixer like Bitcoinfog which is reasonably safe or look on your local Craigslist to see if anyone in your area sells them for cash.<br /><br />If you do need to obtain Bitcoins safely within 48 rather than 24 hours, I&#039;d be happy to work with you. Please see the link to my thread below where I explain how my service works.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25865.msg277772#msg277772">Quote from: cottonwalkway on June 07, 2012, 05:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Haven&#039;t bought Bitcoins before (though I have mined them).<br /><br />Need 150BTC by the weekend, was going to use mtgox but I&#039;ve heard they can take up to 3 days to receive your bank transfer?<br /><br />Anyone know how long http://intersango.com takes to receive your payment?<br /><br />Or am I better off using someone like googleyed on SR and paying by Westernunion or Moneygram?&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I appreciate there are probably a lot of these posts, just wanted some quick clarification.<br /><br />Cheers<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
