				Title: <strong>Secure ROM on MicroSD?</strong><br />

				I was just wondering if it is possible to run a secure ROM or just a separate one with different settings from the MicroSD on your phone. In theory it seems completely possible and it seems like it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to do. You&#039;d have to somehow make your phone boot and only operate from that MicroSD. If anyone has info on this I would love to go over it and possibly give it a shot. Maybe do a write up. I imagine the phone would need to also be rooted. Anyway thanks in advance!

				A dev called Tasssader has recently released something called Multirom for certain android devices. As you probably know a rooted phone with a custom recovery can install different ROMs (versions of Android, which is based on linux)and kernels. However this is a bit of a faff. The beauty of multirom is that it allows you to store different ROMS on your SD card and boot them at will, like a dual boot on a laptop. It will not only boot android ROMs but with a special kernel boot Linux distros (Ubuntu, bodhi, Arch so far). Most excitingly from our point of view it will boot from a USB device. ( above I was referring to internal SD card). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be amazing if someone could get liberte or tails working with this. I think many Linux distros could be ported, they just need packing in a certain way so that the multirom can unpack them. (The dev provides a template; unfortunately it is beyond my abilities!) They can even have their own kernel, as long as the main kernel on the device is the modified multiboot one. You also need a modified TWRP recovery, and obviously a rooted and unlocked bootloader.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Google multirom. It&#039;s early days but it has potential.
