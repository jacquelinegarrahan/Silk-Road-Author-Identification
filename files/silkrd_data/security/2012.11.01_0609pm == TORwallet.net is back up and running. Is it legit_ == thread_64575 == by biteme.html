				I read some posts here about TORwallet being suspected as a scam and it was temporarily offline. <br /><br />I just checked and it&#039;s back up and running now. <br /><br />Additionally, they have added mixing service (for a 3% fee) and your wallet can now be password-protected.<br /><br />I used it before with no problems. Is there any good reason not to use it again?

				Personally I have good experience with them. I forgot my password for my wallet with BTC in them, and was told to wait a month and they would be returned....after waiting i received my coins back =D.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t use them&nbsp; though just to be safe, they&#039;ve been labeled as scammers on Bitcoin forum. Theres no sense using it really when theres instawallet.

				I just tried to send my 5BTC from my torwallet address and I still receive the hot wallet error. They are still scamming like they have been. You will be able to send BTC to that wallet, but not withdraw them. If you want to know who is and isn&#039;t a BTC scammer check the bitcointalk.org forums.

				Torwallet is a 100% scam, so glad I only put .5BTC in there, I know people are out a lot more than I am.<br /><br />This thread gave me hope, but I still can&#039;t access my paltry amount of BTC.<br /><br />Instawallet still works, and SR&#039;s tumbler is good enough for my needs.

				torwallet was a scam. don&#039;t ever use any bitcoin wallet hosted on a tor hidden service. it&#039;s a horrendous idea that makes me facepalm every time anyone asks about it.

I see no issue in sending non-reversible currency to an anonymous 3rd party hosting an anonymous website. /sarcasm<br /><br />Between this, instawallet, and all the other failed webwallets, I wonder what it will take for people to learn that you and you alone are the only safe holder of your BTC.
