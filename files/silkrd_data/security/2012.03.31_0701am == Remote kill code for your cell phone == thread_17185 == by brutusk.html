				Avast has an awesome Android app I have been playing with. Among other things, it is loaded with James Bond-type stuff that allows you to control your phone remotely through sms messaging.<br /><br />It allows you to lock the screen, lock the sim card, restore to factory settings, turn on gps tracking, etc.<br /><br />I have been a bit concerned about my phone because I use Orbot and Orweb to check my SR messages when I can&#039;t get on the internet. I always make sure the data has been cleared, but I am sure if LE saw that they would have a field day. I wrote instructions down for my sister so she could send the lock and wipe commands for me if I should ever need it. I would just love to see the look on the LEO&#039;s face when my phone suddenly reboots and wipes itself while they are trying to figure out the access code hehe

				I tried out Orbot but found it to be an even bigger, slower, pain in the ass than tor on a pc. It was neat though and handy in tight spots where I was busy or on here a shitload but I removed it for safety. If something ever DID go down (knock on wood) and you had to get all your shit cleared, I&#039;d want as few steps as possible involving as few people as possible. Because when you&#039;re getting busted, time goes about 300x faster and you want as few things to worry about as possible. <br /><br />I use a desktop streaming app to browse from my phone. Plus then I can wipe the whole disk from my phone or any other phone running android or iOS.

Works great for me now. I live in an area with no internet, I have to drive a few miles to get online, so being able to get on SR from my phone is pretty handy. I can set my phone up as a hotspot, but I get throttled after 10 gb. Oh I miss the days when I had internet like regular people do!

				Can&#039;t really trust any Android OS because google has infected it with aids so everything you do is then synchd to the google cloud for easy forensic recovery. Even if you disable all gmail addresses and reset to factory it still leaks data.

Word is Charlie Miller and the other guy are going to develop it into a full security suite for free <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t trust any SAT phones, seems they have no problem locking onto signals and spying on them just ask the Syrian resistance <br /><br />

				If you use Tasker you have been able to remotely control your Android phone for ages. I have mine set up so that if it receives a specific text message it replies with a link to a google map of it&#039;s location, another message locks it, another sounds a loud siren and another remotely wipes the SD card. You can even set it to overclock the phone to the point that the MoBo overheats and the phone dies, but I thought that was overkill.

				Installing some sort of android firewall to monitor outgoing connections would stop Carrier IQ and leakage. Why risk it though, between Wikileaks sounding the alarm that every smart phone is multiple backdoored to new draconian spy laws in every country to capture traffic everywhere I wouldn&#039;t trust any phone. GPG email or chat w/OTR encryption is your only guaranteed privacy

				I haven&#039;t really researched Android, though I have one. Best advice is to use Chrome because it comes with a sandbox to prevent arbitrary root execution.. however that doesn&#039;t seem to matter because everyday we hear about new government laws being passed forcing carriers to insert spyware and backdoors into their phones. <br /><br />In every single trial I&#039;ve ever read about regarding smuggling operations or gangsters dealing drugs or terrorists using encryption it was bypassed and actively spied on by multiple agencies and used as smoking gun evidence to their guilt. Don&#039;t use them for business. If anything carry a laptop and jump on jabber+otr to talk to your suppliers or something. Use your phone to order pizza and talk to your girlfriend<br /><br />TextSecure is a great end to end encrypted app but I would still use codewords and other misdirection, no blatant &quot;Hey drugs are on the way!&quot;

				You&#039;d be surprised some of the trial evidence and court docs I read they present like Class 3 smugglers doing millions a year talking about coke and shipping guns to each other in the clear because they believe they&#039;re on an encrypted voIP line using Android/iOS, or blackberry so-called encryption which is now fully backdoored

				A very interesting thread, many thanks for sharing your thoughts all.<br /><br />I am currently conducting business on SR from a Tor web bundle installed in an encrypted home directory and am toying with the idea of buying an Android Tablet specifically for SR - I don&#039;t need to tell all of you the benefits of having a separate, secure device for all your needs.<br /><br />As far as I can tell the new OS 4.0 does allow for full device encryption, perhaps one of you can confirm?<br /><br />Tor browsing is available through Orbot as we&#039;ve already said and you can even generate and use PGP keps through the program APG as memory serves?<br /><br />The one thing which puts me off is that one of my colleagues and I often need to chat in real time about business matters. We use Psi, an XMPP client which can be run through Tor and also supports encrypted conversations through OpenPGP keys.<br /><br />It would seem however Android doesn&#039;t have this feature? If it did, I&#039;d switch over in a heartbeat - would this be something that would interest any of you? I&#039;m toying with the idea of paying a developer to create an app which does this if so?<br /><br />V.
