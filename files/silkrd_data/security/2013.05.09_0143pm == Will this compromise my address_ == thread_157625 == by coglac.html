				OK so, I accidently logged into my MT Gox account with Tor. They flagged it for suspicious activity and I can&#039;t withdraw my coins. They told me the only way to unfreeze my account is to get verified. If I do this will my address be compromised in any way? Or should I just take the loss?

				Not to sure but if it was me, to make sure i remained anon, I would probably take the loss. They could possibly use the information to link you to a certain TOR session (This is a complete guess)

				You could try to get fake documents, but yeah, if you give them real ones then obviously your address will be compromised.<br /><br />Keep in mind, that if you don&#039;t pass their verification process, you will probably lose all access to your account and the money in it.<br />

				I would suggest to get verified and withdraw your funds from Mt Gox. Then run them through Bitcoin Fog so your coins are untraceable. Then never use Mt. Gox again. (Or if you use them, repeat the bitcoin fog every time)

				Thanks for all the advice. I may just take the loss, I would like to keep getting packages at that address without having to worry, I worry enough haha. Can not put a price on peace of mind.<br />

				MTGox used to be the only place I go to in order to trade BTC, they are now on the bottom of my list for various other reasons in addition to the verification requisite.

				You should only be using exchanges if you are using a VPN through Tor. That is You -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN or similar proxy mechanism. Since the people using the exchanges are simultaneously the least likely to know how to set this up and know what they&#039;re doing, I&#039;m leery of explaining how.<br /><br />If you&#039;re using exchanges and don&#039;t know how to anonymize&nbsp; your traffic coming from an exit node in the Tor network, I suggest you stop now.<br /><br />Instead, learn how to do OTC bitcoin. There are dozens of threads and tutorials scattered throughout the forum on it.<br /><br />Unless this is a serious amount of money for you, like at least a months wages or more, I suggest you take this as a lesson. <br /><br />Otherwise you&#039;ll need to buy fake identification documents and take some risks.<br /><br />I have a post explaining how to anonymize your bitcoins if you&#039;ve bought them from an exchange, once you&#039;ve found and read it I think you&#039;ll agree it&#039;s not worth the trouble, simply don&#039;t make the same mistake twice. OTC bitcoin is the way to go.

				As for Rasta&#039;s suggestion, what would be the downside of getting a verified Mt Gox account, access it on clearnet, desposit coins into bitcoin fog, access bitcoin fog in Tor, and then tumble your coins for anonymity there. What would the risks be?

				MtGox has been known to also flag accounts and require verification if you access through a known public proxy or vpn.
