				That&#039;s what I do but with Bitcoin Fog in there, I&#039;ve never found a faster way but I&#039;d love to find a way that&#039;s just as secure and is faster :)

				If you use the bitcoin-qt client, you can set to pay a higher transaction fee... .01 btc per tx........ and you will get higher priority..... Seems faster for me.... paying a few extra cents to help the network can&#039;t hurt either :)

I realise you&#039;re not concerned about safety but naturally you understand that purchases of Bitcoins using traceable methods such as bank transfer will compromise your safety.<br /><br />If you use my service to send coins by Special Delivery at the moment I can guarantee you&#039;ll have them within 48 hours which isn&#039;t too shabby. If you insist on using MtGox &amp; Barclays at the very least pay in the money using cash and run the coins through Bitcoinfog&nbsp; - shouldn&#039;t take more than two to three days all found.<br /><br />All the best, and do send me a message if you have any questions.<br /><br />V.

				I use intersango instead of mtgox as I found the latter to be ridiculously slow (days), so slow in fact that i had to message them to hurry up. Intersango normally only takes a few hours tops IME.

				Fastest in the UK is Intersango. Same level of risk as what you&#039;re currently doing via MTGox, but from your bank to SR in no more than a couple of hours.<br /><br />

				Thanks a lot for the help and suggestions guys. I&#039;ll give Intersango instead of Mt Gox next time I make a purchase of some BitCoin.<br /><br />It&#039;d be great if there was anywhere you could just make a straight up Visa Debit Card or Prepaid Mastercard deposit. Probably asking too much at this point though&nbsp; ;D, and I can imagine there are good reasons why paying via these methods are seemingly so rare to come by.

				Blizzcoin.com <br /><br />You send money and receive bitcoins on your SR account within the hour! Awesome site if you ask me, I&#039;m getting it all there :)
