				I have been here few months now with no problems. I ordered BTCs from a vendor who had some good feedback, not a newbie or anything. I used MoneyPak, gave him the numbers and now he is gone. When I click on his name all I see are the messages and I do not see his account or profile, also I do not see the button to resolve with the admins. What should I do? It is for $1450! I am so upset, how do I proceed with this? Thanks guys!

				His user name while selling BTCs was &quot;The Drugs&quot;. He claims he has a second vendor account. I have emailed the admins as well. I didnt know vendors can have more than one account. How do I find his other account? He claimed he sold pot and aderal. Maybe he will come through. I hope so, why fuck up your vendor chance on SR?

				Vendor selling BTCs named &quot;The Drugs&quot; sent this long winded post to me: &quot;i have the coin and no matter what I will deliver tomorrow. I gave you my word and this all happened because I didnt understand the exact financial rules that green dot uses. But my main vendor accountr has a flawless reputation and so does this one and i wajt to keep it. I iknow whatr its like to wait on your drugs and I dont want to be the reason that you wait a minute longer than you have to. I will wake up extra earlyt and contact green dot immediatly. I will work something out but no matter what I wont let you down. I am a firm believer in karma and I dont want any negetivity comming my way. Now since I tried on your MPs, that wouldnt go on ANY of my cards even thougthey all had room, 1 small moneypak for $75 did go through on one of the cards that didnt accept your MP.<br /><br />I got the coin and you gave me the number I know your legit and even if green dot jerks me around, which I think they will, I think they are going to tell me that it will take like 7 days to get my payment(which I think its because THEY did something inccorrect on those MPS? or something) if I have to I will give you the coin before I actually phsysically recieve the money.<br /><br />I am going to call and ask them about the refund option, which i tried to do, The refund option would allow me to recieve the money as a check instead of a MP which is shitty considering I have cards with room and I was hoping to have them sooner than the reefund option.<br /><br />Keep in mind I dont know exactly how green dot operations or what they bas thier decisions on.<br /><br />This issue is the most important thing I have to deal with tommorrow, first and formost I dont want my reputation damaged because its SOOO hard to build and keep a good rep. But also because my business is growing rapidly. and the ONLY reason I am not selling more on SR and making more money is because its hard for me to sell the bitcoins. I have to get something worked out with green dot so I can continue to grow and expand my business.<br /><br />I just had an idea:<br /><br />how about we do this I have the coin ready to send and i already pushed the refund button option, which was really my only choice. Since I did this I dont have the money but green dot said it was printed out as a check and thats how I will recieve it.<br /><br />If you would be willing to send me a copy of the recipts, that way I know for sure these are your MPs and thier wont be any scammy stuff happeneing somehow then I will send you the coin. This will defintly prove to me that you bought it and thier your MPs so i wont have any issues with green dot when they examine them a little closer.<br /><br />I will also waive the $10 fees. If you do adderalls I can give you 5 15mg addies free. or an 1/8th of very good weed. I would be doing this from my vendor account and in part to show you that I really didnt mean for this to happen but also in part because just 1 bad feedback is going to ruin my account. You dont understand thier is so much competion and reputation is everything. I am soo sorry that green dot is giving me the running around but I am going to devote a few hours tommreow to this problem. That way no matter how long they keep me on the phone I wil,l get all the answers you deserve. Please remember that this is a huge blow for me also. I was so excited that my sales on SR are just increasing amazingly quickly and all the silk roaders are such good people I love selling on SR. But now I am stuck trying to figure out how I can sell on SR and turn all these bitcoisn in to cash. Each day I grow so its going to be an increasingly difficult problem to deal with oOo&quot;<br /><br />Who ever and where ever you are, know this: Karma is real. Post my bitcoins to avoid getting the negative effects of karma. Your promise of &quot;tomorrow&quot; did not realize. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is now gone. You have a choice, do the right thing and keep your promise or steel my money and suffer the law of nature, KARMA! I trusted you and I love SR too much to give up on it but people like you who play with others trust and money are the reason why SR may not make it. Now everything is in the hands of the law of cause and effect.

				So the vendor in question &quot;The Drugs&quot; showed up in messages today on the market and said the following after numerous messages of mine: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I will be speaking with a supervisor at green dot today. I recieved several e mails back and forth but now some progress is being maddl I am so sorry for this I went out last night 2celelbrate and now its 60am and a am really hung overl&quot; Wow! Also no one from SR support has responded to my message asking for their assistance. Is there anything else I can do? I called Green Dot today and my money has been refunded to him by check. They would not release his address to me but I could possibly get it if I press since I have the receipts. Any suggestions on that??

				It sounds like to me that he screwed you over.&nbsp; &nbsp;How did you find him?&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never seen him listed.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it makes no sense for him to have 2 accounts, they aren&#039;t cheap and any legit business could be done on just one.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sorry man.&nbsp; &nbsp; But I would not send him anything further.&nbsp; as in the stuff he was asking you to send.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are legit, he should need nothing further.

				Yes, I agree his post was outrageous! I am sweating bullets over my money and he is telling me he is celebrating! Whatever, because MP did not deposit the money in his account (god know why) he requested a refund. That takes 12 days. Well I just got off the phone with the nice people at MP and cancelled the refund. I have the cards, receipts so MP only cares about me. I am faxing over the items tomorrow and getting my money back in few days. Lesson learned! Do not use MP with shady vendors! <br />I found him in the Money section on SR just the other day selling BTC for less than an hour. His vendor name is &quot;The Drugs&quot;, very very small fee.<br />I got a message from one more person who got scammed for 400 bucks by him. It appears none of my money left the offices of MP so big chance I might get my money back! Too early to tell but one can hope! I work hard for my money and strongly believe in KARMA! Wish me luck, folks! Will update you. Meantime I am left with no BTC :( Dude gave his address to MP to get the refund. They could do all kinds of things with that if they want to....

				I hope everything works out with your MoneyPaks and you do get your money back.&nbsp; If you do, count yourself EXTREMELY lucky.&nbsp; The one time I tried doing a MP to BTC transaction on this site, I had to threaten the seller with retaliation in these forums before he would send me my coins, and this was with a VERY reputable vendor.&nbsp; The problem with a transaction like this on SR is that it is essentially the same as finalizing early on an order.&nbsp; They have your money, all you can do is cross your fingers and hope they aren&#039;t an outright scammer or even a selective scammer, as was the case in my experience.&nbsp; Anyway, my advice is to find another way to get your bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				wow i am terribly sorry to hear this. to me it sounds like he just delaying you and running you in circles. <br /><br />but one thing i dont get- why in the HELL would you trust some random person who claims to have a second vendor account with damn near $1500? there is not ONE bitcoin vendor on this website that I would trust with a $1450 moneypak. in fact, using moneypaks for bitcoins is very dangerous here period.<br /><br />if you get your money back, or for future bitcoin purchases.. i recommend blueskytraders. i am not affiliated with them in any way, i&#039;ve just done about 1k worth of business with them in a week and a half and they deliver coins in under an hour. check them out here. many people use them.<br /><br />he is a piece of shit and karma is a big bitch. he will get his.

				Let me get this straight.&nbsp; His attempt to make things right was to ask you for your home address, promising drugs in return?<br /><br />Either I&#039;m being paranoid, or it&#039;s a trojan horse.<br /><br />Ask him for his address so that you can snail mail him the receipt.

				I don&#039;t know why I gave my money to this low life. I made a mistake. But in my defense I have worked with Sugar Mama with no problem, so there must be good Money Pak vendors on here... I will stop doing that for a while, too expensive and risky. Faxed my receipts to Green Dot today, hopefully I will get my money back! To all who are messaging me about it, I don&#039;t know why Money Pak is able to help me, I think it is because my money never left them so it is possible for them to stop payment before it went to the jerk scammer.
