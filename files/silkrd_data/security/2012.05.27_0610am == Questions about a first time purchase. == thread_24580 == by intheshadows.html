				Hi Everyone!<br /><br />I will soon be making my first order on SR and I just wanted to run my set up past a few people to see what you think about it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not 100% on everything so I&#039;d appreciate any tips!<br /><br />First, We&#039;re going to be making a disposable email address and Mt Gox account on an unsecured wireless connection without tor.&nbsp; I will be using an old laptop that I received from a friend and the wireless connection is decently far from my residence.&nbsp; I will then hop on Tor and use BitInstant to transfer BitCoin into my Mt Gox account.&nbsp; I will have a friend take the BitInstant invoice to a bank, also decently far away from my residence, and make the deposit.&nbsp; I&#039;ll then use BitLaundry and probably send it through a few insta-wallets before finally transferring the BitCoin to SR.<br /><br />I&#039;m planning on shipping to my own residence with the name of a previous resident that we still regularly get mail from.&nbsp; The order is very small (under 2g) and will be shipping from US to US.<br /><br />Is my method of acquiring BitCoin safe enough and should I be worried about shipping to my own residence with such a small package?<br /><br />I appreciate any tips or feedback!<br />Thanks for the help.&nbsp; :)

				I would use my own name.<br /><br />Knowing my luck, they&#039;d finally figure out they don&#039;t live here anymore just in time for my package.

				You really think that using my own name would be safer?<br /><br />The name I will be using is a previous residence name. Although that person hasn&#039;t been a resident for over a year we still get pretty regular mail for him.&nbsp; Our postman wouldn&#039;t notice a difference because he would probably recognize the name coming to this address and If I use my own name it would be extremely easy to pin it on me, right?&nbsp; I assume that they already realize he is not a resident, but they still deliver his mail all the time.<br /><br />What do you think?

				It sounds like you&#039;ve taken every other security step possible.<br /><br />So I wouldn&#039;t really be worried about using your real name.<br /><br />It also sounds like you can afford a decent lawyer, that means in the unlikely event (given all the other precautions you&#039;ve taken) that you do get pinned, if you just keep your mouth shut you&#039;re going to be fine. Nobody can really prove you ordered it. They call it plausible deniability.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;d chance using the wrong name. I mean it&#039;s likely that the package will get through just fine, but you have no way of knowing if any of the previous tenant&#039;s mail has been denied (maybe only some gets through). It also may look funny because that name all of a sudden started ordering packages after getting nothing but spam for this long.<br /><br />If the majority of your mail comes in your name, then the postman is less likely to notice a small package coming in your name (which could be ANYTHING). And at this point, the postal service is the only thing that could POSSIBLY get you busted (short of how you use the product, or the vendor keeping your name on a list, but those are beyond your mail receiving control).<br /><br />

				Thanks for the info.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to weigh my options here for a bit, but I still feel more comfortable with the name of a previous resident.&nbsp; Not all the mail that we receiving is junk mail.&nbsp; The name we will be usng still gets some official mail here (banks, government, etc) and also some personal mail.&nbsp; He even still gets some personal emails as well.<br /><br />I appreciate the input very much! and I&#039;ll seriously take your advice into consideration.<br /><br />Would there be any safer methods of receiving the package?&nbsp; A PO Box sounds like a bad idea and I don&#039;t really have an idea of where else I would ship it to.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help!

You&#039;d still need ID to register the box. The only safer method of receiving the package is to get a trusted friend to receive it for you, and take the blame if they get pinned.<br /><br />They apparently (I am not a lawyer, and all the advice I&#039;ve been giving is hearsay gleamed from the forums), do not have enough evidence to press charges based on intercepting a package alone (in the US), they would have to do a controlled delivery.<br /><br />They are not going to fund a controlled delivery for that small of an amount (read the post from the former USPS intern, somewhere in this forum). They throw away tons of drugs everyday.<br /><br />The idea is to make your packages blend in seamlessly with your other mail. So if you get more mail from your previous tenant than you do yourself, and have for years, then that might be the way to go.
