				I have seen the video: &quot;10 Rules for Dealing with Police&quot;. <br />It&#039;s really interesting, it&#039;s incredible that you can negate your consens to almost every control by the police.<br /><br />I live in Italy, and so i searched some tips on how to deal with the police in Italy, but i found nothing. <br /><br />You know, here it&#039;s all very different. The law isn&#039;t so bad, but the police is above it. <br />For example, some years ago, a 44 years old man, Aldo Bianzino, was put in jail because he had one marijuana plant. Then he had a cerebral hemorrhage, and the guards let him die. <br /><br />There are also other cases of drug-users being brutalized in jail, if not killed.<br /><br />So it would be very important for the italian a guide on how to deal with these monsters.<br /><br />I know that we have the right to be silent, but nothing more.<br /><br />Some advice to the italian people? Maybe from other italian users?<br /><br /><br />

				Well, the main police department that fight the drug trade is &quot;Guardia di Finanza&quot;, but obviously also the other 2 department (Polizia and Carabinieri) can arrest you if you have drugs. <br />But you know, I think it&#039;s a bit different, the police almost never enter in your house to make a control, the police almost never perquisite you or control your car, they are principally bored people. They fight like in war during the demonstrations, but usually they do nothing.<br /><br />It&#039;s different than the US, and we need a guide.

				Do not use a video about how to deal with USA police as an instruction guide to deal with foreign police...... that should be common sense.
