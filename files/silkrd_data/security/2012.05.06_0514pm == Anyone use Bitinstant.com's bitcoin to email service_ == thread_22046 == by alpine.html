				1. Is there another fee on top of the 3.99%? If so how much more<br />2. How fast does the email get sent and into your wallet?<br />3. How would you transfer it to your wallet? I guess just follow a link?<br /><br />Thanks, alpine

				Ya I&#039;m actually curious about this as well... <br /><br />Like, what price are they using to convert your money to bitcoins? Is it the average MTGOX rate or something? <br />

				I&#039;ve used it several times, and been happy with their service.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. Is there another fee on top of the 3.99%? If so how much more</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m not sure. You have to go through a company called Trust Cash if you&#039;re making a cash deposit at a bank, and I can&#039;t remember if they charge something on top of that as well. I just deposit about $20 over what I want to ultimately end up in my SR account, and that&#039;s always been plenty.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How fast does the email get sent and into your wallet?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is a fairly new offering on their part, so I can&#039;t tell you exactly as I&#039;ve previously had to use CryptoXChange to do the conversion. I can tell you that from the time I make the deposit to the bank to the time I see funds in my CryptoXChange account is typically an hour or so. I&#039;d expect the bitcoin to email would be about the same, or perhaps even faster.<br /><br />

				So I did a little reshearch and through bitinstant you can get your coins sent to your email. So what happens is you select email as recieve and then they will use a free service called coinapult.com<br />Which sends you a email and then you just click the link enter your bitcoin address and the coins are sent

				Yeah. I&#039;m going to try this out today. It would be really nice to cut out CryptoXChange, since the only thing I use them for is USD to BTC conversion. The bitcoin to email service, combined with bitfog seems like it would be nice and anonymous.
