				After transferring funds from blockchain to instawallet, instawallet informs me I must wait appr. 20 min before my funds are confirmed. It has been displaying this message for over an hour now. Do I have to wait until I do not receive this message anymore, or can I send my funds to another wallet at this point?

				phubaiblues- Thanks for your response! I am realizing that I will need to have patience with these things and that there is no reason to compromise my self just to get something quicker. I was hoping to place an order today to receive my goodies before the weekend but it looks like that is not going to happen. And to answer your question, It says I have received my funds, they just will not be available for spending until they are confirmed. It says exactly: &quot;These funds are not confirmed yet, they will be spendable in approximately 20 min.&quot; and has said this statement for about 2.5+ hours. Just curious if anyone else has had this problem in the past...<br />All I know is if I can&#039;t get an order in before Dec. 21ist and then the world ends, I&#039;m gonna be pissed. Haha

And often it says 20 minutes, even when it is going to be more like an hour! If you really want to see where your BTC are use something like blockexplorer or blockchain and enter your address to see. Normally it should not take as long as two hours though. But shit happens, just keep refreshing the display, I am certain the message will go away. It always has for me :)

				In my experience instawallet has been awesome as an intermediary for getting coins then transferring to SR - bitcoinchainblock (think that&#039;s the name - apologies if it&#039;s not) is also very good

				Yeah, good point Nakorx ^^^, I forgot abouit refreshing the damn thing, but I&#039;ve had pretty good luck with moving btc around lately, actually seems faster than it used to...hell, I expected it to take 8 hours or more when I first got rolling with these things, but now seems--in general--faster...of course, now I said that, it&#039;ll be 24 hrs next time I need&#039;em ;)<br /><br />But year, just like Tor, bitcoins damn sure take patience at times...

				Has anyone gotten a &quot; Ur spending limit is 0 BTC&quot; type of message on instawallet, when sending BTC to ur SR wallet?(this message popped up right below the &quot;u must wait 20 minutes for ur transaction to confim&quot; for me) And now, my BTC aren&#039;t in my instawallet anymore. I can only assume that it&#039;s in transaction to my SR wallet, but it&#039;s been over an hour and nothing in my SR account, I&#039;m freaking out. :&#039;(

				if you keep trying it should eventually say your transaction has successfully been sent with an id number. There should be a green bar. When it says 20 minutes it usually seems more like 30. Just check blockchain.info with the instawallet address and also your sr wallet. Its easy to track where your bitcoins are, on blockchain when it gets up to 4 or 5 confirmations your btc should arrive

				I tracked my transaction on blockchain.info, and I have 24 confirmation and the arrow is still red, so I guess it didn&#039;t go thur yet. (I still have hope!) <br />Reading my transactions on blockchain: I have 2 transactions. My first transaction from blockchain wallet address to instawallet address has 25 confirmations and has a green arrow, Obviously successful transaction, since I had the BTC in my instawallet. But the 2nd transaction is on 24 confirmation and the arrow is still red. I hope it goes thur. I know I&#039;m not fucking using instawallet again.
