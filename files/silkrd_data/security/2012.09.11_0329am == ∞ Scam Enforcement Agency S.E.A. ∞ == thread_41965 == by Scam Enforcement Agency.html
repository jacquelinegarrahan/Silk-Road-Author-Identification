				Greetings Earthlings! I am the Scam Enforcement Agency (S.E.A.). As a social engineer that could easily work for the D.E.A. I also happen to be against the state - and an Anarchist at that. I became a &quot;social engineer&quot; when I became interested in business. I quickly learned all the tricks and guess what? I was disgusted by the manipulation seen in modern society today. I spent the next few years in exile pondering existence and the meaning of life. I decided to return to serve for a greater good, far beyond the good of just humanity, but all that is. Together we will work as one.<br /><br />What I am here to do is catch scammers before they scam. What I do is lurk, question, analyze scamming patterns, and I have a good sense of smell. I can smell fishy at a great distance. From the USA to England. From Germany to Canada. In addition to my service, if you suspect someone is scamming, send me a PM and I will run a thorough investigation - for free. I also urge you to take matters into your own hands and do the work yourself, or we can work together. If you wish to remain anonymous I can post the information for you (I will quote you as &quot;Anonymous&quot;). I may set up something for you to send me messages anonymously so you don&#039;t have to worry about trusting me, however I am here for the people and I will not release any usernames.<br /><br />By the end of this sentence, I am confident that I no longer am &quot;I&quot; - we are we. I am you and you are me. I believe karma will take care of scammers, and we can take care of each other by thinking on our feet and helping each other detect scammers.<br /><br />For the people, by the people! We as individuals are our own governments. We as a community are separate from the State (even though it&#039;s all connected). We are here to show the D.E.A. that we can function as active members in society without any violence. Revolution starts within, but we have to make sure we don&#039;t end up in the same place when the wheel is done turning (re-volution).<br /><br />I am here for you, in the same way that you&#039;re here for me. Each person is an intricate piece of infinity. I feel like if you could see what I see, then we as humanity could be free. I&#039;m here for you, not for any self-centered reasons, because existence is interdependent and all&#039;s related, connected as different manifestations of one single mind, you ain&#039;t isolated from the world even though it feels like that sometimes. - Eyedea<br /><br />p.s. Don&#039;t FE. Mt. Gix, we&#039;re watching you - Fear us. All those who have scammed in the past, we&#039;ve been watching you.<br />

				I smoke large amounts of marijuana on purpose so I can get paranoid and think on my feet, therefore catch scammers along with some ridiculous posts because existence is ridiculous. I also needed a cool intro, just like your favorite TV show with that awesome theme song.<br /><br />I hope this makes him and others think twice about the scam. Don&#039;t be surprised if a vendor ends up not scamming because they FE(AR) us. <br /><br />So yes, if scammer ends up not scamming after being called out then S.E.A. will look like a knob, but maybe we saved a bunch of people from getting scammed and that&#039;s what&#039;s important to me.

				HI SEA,<br /><br />What I think we really need around here is someone also investigating scamming reviewers and users. There are such conflicting reviews for the same products and vendors at times. Can you social engineer a solution for us?&nbsp; ;)

				I was away at festival acid land, but I will investigate further into the PMs that I got. Sorry, I&#039;m a real person too behind the alter-ego.<br /><br />For the person who said I&#039;m LEO. YES, please stay that paranoid. That&#039;s the kind of attitude that will not get you scammed or caught! If it ever gets in the way of your mental health then you need to be more stealthy with whatever you&#039;re doing. But no, I&#039;m not LEO. I was a buyer that got scammed once and that was the final time. However, I notice a ton of buyers still get scammed a lot. Just don&#039;t FE! That&#039;s the most important part. If you FE you&#039;re shooting yourself in the foot.<br /><br />Stay safe Earthlings.

				SEA. Scam Enforcement Agency?<br /><br />Eh? Does that mean you&#039;re enforcing scams? Shouldn&#039;t it be more like: Honest Trade Enforcement Agency? You&#039;d be H-Tea. Or get creative and it&#039;d HEAT.<br /><br />I think Scam Monitors would be a more correct name. That also abbreviates nicely. Rihanna could sing your theme song.<br /><br />Either way, I support this. Go change your world boys!<br /><br /><br /><br />
