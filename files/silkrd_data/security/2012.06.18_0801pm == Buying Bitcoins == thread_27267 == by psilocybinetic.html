				I made my Campbx.com account the other day. Today I got a 40$ money order from Rite Aid, put down the address and company I&#039;m supposed to send it to, my user name and email, everything it said to put down, and dropped it off in a USPS mail box thingy. I dont want to trade BTC with any other members or any of the other bullshit listed on the website, I just want to get my USD funds on campbx, transfer them into bitcoins, and send it to my SR BTC address. <br />Can anyone who has a campbx account tell me step by step how to do so? Im not that much of a techie, I just been trying figure this out for weeks, and Im about to explode.

				The process with MtGox and Bitinstant is very simple.<br /><br />1) Set up a Mt. Gox account (do NOT access Mt. Gox with Tor or your account will be suspended, clearnet is fine)<br />2) Under &quot;Fund&quot; options, choose &quot;Cash Deposit with Bitinstant&quot;<br />3) This will take you to Trustcash. Follow the instructions here to make a deposit invoice slip. Personally I use Bank of America, it&#039;s easy. <br />4) Assuming you did Bank of America, you simply take that invoice to your local bank and the person at the counter should give you a deposit slip that you can fill out with the right information.<br />5) Within an hour all your money in your Mt. Gox account. Now you can easily buy the bitcoins and send them to SR.<br /><br />Good luck and have fun! And always be secure. Switch up banks from time to time, never sign anything (you shouldn&#039;t need to, I never have), that sort of thing.

That sounds pretty simple. My current issue is that there is no Bank of America&#039;s around me. No Wells Fargo. Chase has been what i been using but my vendor&#039;s Chase account got shut down. So rt now i have no way of getting bitcoins. And i was also curious what the fees were?? I was curious if i could just bitinstant for everything. I deposit money into a bank account (on the from side) to bitcoin address (on the to side) and use the bitcoint address off SR to send the money. Do i even need MTGox?? <br /><br />Regardless thank you! I&#039;m looking into the MtGox rt now. Do they offer different bank other than Bank of America? <br /><br />Thanks again and i would never sign anything!! I know better :) <br /><br />

				Yeah I don&#039;t have the full list on hand, but there are other banks, as well as weird choices like Walmart, CVS, and 7-11. I&#039;ve never done anything other than Bank of America but I&#039;m sure they work just as well. The fee is fairly steep I guess. For every $150 I deposit, I lose about $8 or so, but it&#039;s worth it for the simplicity and security. I used to us Dwolla but that ship sailed a long time ago and I&#039;d rather not risk my information being tied to my bitcoins. Welcome to paradise&nbsp; 8)

				Is the notion of getting bitcoins sourced from a SR vendor just out of the question? Someone named Wakannabi, with help from a mod, has put together a guide to exchangers here on the road:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26310.0<br />

				No I used to get my bitcoins from SR vendors but nobody offers a bank in my area. If you know of any vendor that offers Chase Let me know!!! Bank of america, wells fargo, and citi r all over 100 miles away. I would Western Union the money to a reputable vendor!!! BlueSkyTraders, do you accept Western Union?

				i see no reason to use Mt. Gox if you&#039;re using bitinstant.&nbsp; just have the coin sent straight to your TOR wallet, or to a throwaway email addy via the &quot;coinapult&quot; method.<br /><br />mtgox is definitely a security breach, as they&#039;ve stated they will do whatever they can to aid law enforcement.&nbsp; you&#039;re better off if you just pretend that site doesn&#039;t exist.

It would be painfully slow for the client, but if that were the only viable option….&nbsp; PM us if you’re interested, we can figure something out.<br /><br />The client wouldn’t get a receipt, like a bank deposit receipt using our, or BitInstant’s system, for example. Minimizing risk by choosing a better-known vendor might help with the confidence factor. If you keep your transactions small in amount, same thing. A bitcoin exchanger is less likely to risk a great rep to steal relatively small amounts, notwithstanding the existence of selective scammers. <br /><br />Also, there is a new review thread (with mod support) on the forums that might be useful to you:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26310.15<br /><br />

Most of the big banks rob people like this - they take the spot price of say dollars to euros and add .10c to it but say they charge no fees. Do the math.<br /><br />Also, to be honest i am a low end drug buyer and am not as paranoid as most people about getting busted...

				Bitinstant is very easy to use, although they charge I think 3.5% or something like that.<br /><br />Some people go to a bank and make a cash deposit, others (like me) send a moneygram (with fake details), and the bitcoins show up wherever you have bitinstant send them to in about an hour or so. Very easy to use and noob friendly. But again, they charge a fee. I bought 40 dollars worth of bitcoins the other day and I believe my total bill when I sent the MG was $48. <br /><br />
