				I got to thinking last night a lot of people try to avoid getting caught selling or what not by simply not dealing with the wrong people and being careful... but what about people who take it a step further? What about somehow monitoring police radios, or some radio frequency, and hearing raid-radiochatter before you get raided, so you have somewhat of an advantage?<br /><br />General techniques like that, that might perhaps save someones ass. For instance I knew a guy who&#039;s property was far down a dirt road, and he had hidden cameras set up near the top of the road that sounded an alarm in his house. It was at that point he has about 60 seconds before that vehicle got to his house, and he was able to act quickly to clear out the house. He avoided getting caught in 3 raids this way, in spite of having to replace some of his furniture on multiple occasions, leaving the door open so it didnt get busted down, etc. <br /><br />What other techniques might be possible to be employed to be one step a head of people trying to bust you. Right now, someone who isn&#039;t me&#039;s primary weakpoint is the risk of a CD.... but that&#039;s about it. Though there&#039;s always a chance of unrelated raids and what not. Any tips? So far I&#039;ve thought of the obvious:<br /><br />Security/Surveillance<br />Police Scanners<br /><br />Everyone I know who&#039;s been caught simply was not careful, and never thought about this stuff... though there&#039;s always those tech/smart people out there that use such careful and calculated thought to stay ahead of the police. <br /><br />Lets keep in mind, since it seems to be brought up by EVERYONE here, that LE do read these forums... but lets be real, a LE person reading preventional techniques on here is not going to incite a change of raid/police procedure on a national level. If you don&#039;t feel comfortable posting, please don&#039;t fear monger, just go on your way. Nobody will be offended if you don&#039;t want to share your secrets.

				One thing I just remembered is that a person can build a super-wifi antenna by modifying a $50 Satellite dish, and mount it inside their house perhaps. WIFI signals can be picked up for 4-5 blocks through trees and houses, and if there is a clear line of sight, signals up to 30 miles can be high-jacked. I use this combined with a linux-program called air-crack and I can easily hack into any WEP protected wifi signal in about 1-5hours(tops). There are tutorials online how to do this and it&#039;s very simple.. maybe takes 5 minutes to set up and get going. It&#039;s something I suggest anyone who is serious about being anonymous online invest in. I am always switching my Wifi signal and I personally alternate between about 30 different ones. In my neighborhood such a Dish set up gives me access to nearly 70-90 wifi signals, some password protected, some not, but eitherway, I can get into them all easily.

				Love it.<br /><br />What about taking it a step further and infiltrating the postal system? Its probably not feasible at this point in the game, but as this community grows, it something to consider. If we have enough operatives in the postal system, warnings could be issued in case of an intercepted package, etc

A person already has to be careful enough about who they trust in the drug game, the last thing you need is a random person in such a position knowing.

Triangulation can very precisely pinpoint where a WiFi signal is coming from. There are devices that can instantaneously pinpoint the location of all devices connecting to a certain access point. <br /><br />http://www.flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/network-testing/AirCheck-Wi-Fi-Tester<br /><br />These days even local police agencies have such devices. People are constantly being busted using their neighbors WiFi in the mistaken belief that it is impossible to trace back to them. Assuming you regularly spoof your MAC address, It is very unlikely that you will be identified as the person who used a given wireless access point if you are no longer engaged in a pattern of using it by the time the police arrive. However, it is still possible to narrow in on people in such circumstances. For example, the FBI identified Petraeus&#039;s mistress despite the fact that she always used WiFi at hotels, due to the fact that her name was the only one registered at all the hotels during the time when communications were sent. This is a sort of intersection attack that could make it possible to deanonymize someone over time even if you don&#039;t get them with a live trace. However, live traces are trivial to do if you are in the area.

				The diamond standard of CD prevention technology is interception detection technology. Essentially with every shipment you need to include a device that has secret information in volatile memory and which is hooked up to a photovoltaic cell. It needs to be constructed such that if light hits the photovoltaic cell, the secret information is wiped. Get the package sent to a PMB registered with a fake ID, and prior to picking the package up query the included device for the secret information (it could use a zero knowledge proof of knowledge). If it has the secret information that means the photovoltaic cell was never triggered, which means the package was never opened (or it was opened in a darkroom). If it doesn&#039;t have the secret information, that means the photovoltaic cell was triggered, which means that somebody opened the package between you and the vendor. You could also have it test for pressure or for the presence of oxygen, and vacuum seal the device with the drugs.

				^^ Love it @km!<br /><br />Regarding my postal operative idea, you wouldn&#039;t really have to give them any information about packages. Their job would be to only relay information to the community about intercepted packages. But trust is still a factor... I can definitely see how this could be abused...

A better method is simply requiring no signature... and if they try to get you to sign, don&#039;t. Sometimes a signature is inevitable though, such as Canada-&gt;USA
