				Hey guys, what&#039;s going on? <br />I&#039;ve got a few questions here o-O<br /><br />Today I tried buying bitcoins using the bitinstant-mt.gox-moneygram method. When I went to pay using zipzap, the cashier who was entering my info, said that it couldn&#039;t be processed cause my mt-gox bank acn&#039;t number isn&#039;t valid or my last name wasn&#039;t working. I provided my real info so it couldn&#039;t have been my last name. However, I did use the same mt-gox acnt during my previous transaction. <br />I don&#039;t mind providing my real info, since purchasing bitcoins is legal, but is my mt-gox acnt flagged by any chance? If so, why?<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard of people mentioning the bitme method, where I just deposit money at a chase bank. I&#039;ve never made a cash deposit before. How exactly does this method work? IS it anonymous?<br /><br />Also, do people really value their anonymity when it comes to purchasing bitcoins? If so, why? I&#039;m kind of curious here.<br />I&#039;m also curious about what methods ya&#039;ll use when it comes to purchasing bitcoins.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				The Bitinstant blog says that cash deposits will be available again tomorrow (Friday) night. Hopefully that is the case.

				When I purchase bitcoins its important that I do it anonymously, mt gox wants to much info as does bitinstant. I just use moneypak for bitcoin exchangers and I always do fine and its anonymous

				Try sending to an address instead of Mtgox.&nbsp; Seems to work.&nbsp; Well, it worked when the mtgox didn&#039;t.&nbsp; And you save yourself some coin.
