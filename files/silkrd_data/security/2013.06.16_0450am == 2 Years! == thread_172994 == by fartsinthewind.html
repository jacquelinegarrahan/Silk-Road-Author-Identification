				My SR odometer just clicked over the two year mark!! I can&#039;t believe it. I remember that first order, the waiting killed me. Now here I am, two years and 120+ transactions later,and still a safe traveller of the road. I&#039;ve had two out of 120 packs not arrive, with one additional scam. I&#039;ve had the fortune of being able to relocate 4 times to entirely different regions due to work. I can say the road is safer now than it was back then. Hell, bitcoins are even easier to come by!&nbsp; <br /><br />Be well, all!

				Fartsinthewind,<br /><br />Firstly, I and my fellow officers were having a good chuckle about your username.<br />Secondly, congratulations on the longevity of your use. May you receive another thousand, problem free orders!<br />Thirdly, when selecting my own avatar I clicked on Korn to have a look, when I saw the photo, I thought it was Ron Jeremy.<br />Fourthly, thank you for sharing your own experience regarding missing orders. Many of us, myself included, have been thoroughly bothered and freaked out over missing orders but it is good to see no ill has come of it.<br />Fifthly, Keep on Truckin&#039;!
