				I&#039;m wanting to order a personal amount of some pills or psychedelics.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read about security and everything on this forum for hours, so I know the precautions to take.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if all that encrypting, Liberte, and GPG (still not sure what it is) are necessary.&nbsp; If I&#039;m only going to order a few times, have no legal record, and only personal amounts, will I be okay with just the following precautions?<br /><br />- BoA cash deposit &gt; Getbitcoins &gt; instawallet &gt; SR<br />- PGP for name/address<br />- Not signing for anything<br /><br />I also keep the Tor browser bundle and anything related to SR on a flash drive, that I keep hidden when not in use.&nbsp; Do I need to understand and implement Liberte and full-disk encryption, or should I be fine?&nbsp; Also, a question about contraband in the home.&nbsp; Some people say it&#039;s not totally necessary to clear your home.&nbsp; As long as I don&#039;t sign, can they still raid the house and find my paraphernalia and pot stash?

				im a noob like you but from what i understand there has not been a confirmed arrest from dealing online with SR, at least no one on here has heard of one.. <br /><br />im 100% positive that there are are people on SR that do not encrypt, and are ordering alot of volume.. it sounds like you are on the right track and ahead of alot of people already in terms of security. <br /><br />when i start up i will be encrypting all communication, using tormail, minimal ordering, not being dumb.. i think thats bassicly the key..

Since safety is measured by degree, none of us are *absolutely* safe.<br /><br />Add the extra layer of OS encryption is really only useful in the case that your PC is taken away as evidence.<br /><br />If Silkroad becomes a regular haunt for you, then maybe just run truecrypt on you OS.<br /><br />The main risks of not being inside an encrypted OS are:<br /><br />[-] Confiscated PC as evidence<br />[-] Some friend (or enemy) snoops on your PC when you are in the bathroom or whatever<br />[-] Accidental discovery by family or friend<br /><br />If none of those concern you, then simply continue as you are (nothing wrong with that).<br /><br />

				Thanks for the response.&nbsp; But could someone answer the last part?&nbsp; If I don&#039;t sign, they can&#039;t raid the house or get a warrant, right?&nbsp; I know I&#039;m being overly paranoid, but I just want to make sure.
