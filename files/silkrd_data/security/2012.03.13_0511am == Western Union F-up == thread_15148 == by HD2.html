				I love my bitcoins but in some of my trade I still need to use WU.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always use false information and a test question.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today I went in there and told them the same schtick, &quot;he has no ID&quot;,&quot; I need to use a test question.&quot;<br /><br />Receiver goes out, and neither are happening.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am going back there tomorrow with the carbon of the transaction because that is all I have for verification and I will ask them nicely to correct their error.<br /><br />What should I expect when going in there?&nbsp; If they ask for ID I&#039;ll just tell them that I don&#039;t have one either.&nbsp; Pretty unbelievable to not have any ID I&#039;d say but it is the only chance I got.<br /><br />I might be able to grease them?&nbsp; $20 bucks $40 bucks?<br /><br />I&#039;m just hoping that somebody will shed some light on the situation.

				Sorry, I do not understand what your saying here...please be more clear. They got the test question wrong? It should be an easily fixable problem if that is the case if you have the receipt and everything.&nbsp; Hopefully you were not sending a WU payment to any of the vendors on here because that is against the rules.

				I have heard of WU refusing test question in some cases even when it is on the form, and treating it as a sort of double authentication (require you to show ID and answer the question). Seems some people have more luck with WU than others, maybe it depends on exactly where you are or something, or maybe some of the WU agents are just retarded.
