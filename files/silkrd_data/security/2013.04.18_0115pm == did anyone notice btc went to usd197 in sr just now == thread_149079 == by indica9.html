				indica9, how do you see the SR bitcoin valuation? I never found a link to see it displayed, I guess I never looked into it that much. Or do you just go by calculating the prices of your listings? I&#039;d really like to know.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Ya, I saw it this time as my coin value tripled in my account without any new coin coming in. Was careful to watch for orders this time. Was scary.
