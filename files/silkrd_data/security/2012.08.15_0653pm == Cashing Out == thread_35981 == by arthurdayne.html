				I am extremely confused about cashing out btc. I just want to wire the USD into my bank account, but there seem to be so many places ( Dwolla, Crypto, MTGox, Aurum, ec.} that seem to crossadvertise and duplicate services. I cannot figure out exactly what each one does. Why isn&#039;t there one I can use to buy and sell both, or at least cash out in one easy step?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, when I eventually do this, am I then to become aware of some previously unmentioned delays?

				You can do it all at Mt. Gox<br /><br />I would AT LEAST make sure your coins are clean before they get to Mt. Gox<br /><br />Once there you have to prove who you are submit ID and all. and bank account info.<br /><br />After all that you can convert your BTC to USD and then wire it to your linked bank account.<br /><br /><br />I did&nbsp; this once back in the day of OG bitcoins. I recall the bank wire taking like 10 days. They were legit clean coins. I didnt see any use for BTC back then ;)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how long it takes now. :\<br /><br />Hope that helps. Be safe.<br />

				Oh yeah, and I think it is &quot;bitinstant&quot; that will let you &quot;wire&quot; directly to a paypal account.<br /><br />Again I have not done any of this since I been on the road it was all a couple years ago at least.<br />

				i would advise not using paypal, they will freeze your funds faster than you can say the word defraud for any action(s) they deem &quot;suspicious&quot;. trust me, i know from personal experience. do not deal with those effing crooks.&nbsp;
