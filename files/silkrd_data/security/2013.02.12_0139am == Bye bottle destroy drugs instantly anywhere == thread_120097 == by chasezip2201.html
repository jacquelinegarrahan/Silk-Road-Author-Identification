				I found this product its essentially a little chamber that hangs in a water bottle and when you press it, it releases acid down into the bottle destroying the contents.<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of hard to explain but check it out<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://byebottle.com/<br />CLEARNET

				I know as far as USA law goes, you can&#039;t be charged with possession if it&#039;s already in your system. Just eat your drugs and save yourself 150USD

				Claims:<br />&quot;A proprietary blend of Acids and Enzymes that eats thru anything inside the bottle&quot;<br />&quot;It will burn and irritate skin if left on skin, (wash thouroghly if contact to skin is made)&quot;<br />&quot;All contents become liquid in .02 sec&quot;<br /><br />- What kind of liquid dissolves weed, tablets and ziplock baggies in .02 sec, but not the water bottle itself? (The bottles are most likely made of PP or PE, just like ziplock baggies)<br />- Why isn&#039;t there any video that shows the dissolving process in a clear water bottle?<br />- Where is the MSDS?<br />- The cap costs 50$ but 150$ with a bottle. 100$ for a water bottle?? <br />&quot;Alert! Patent Pending&quot; - Whenever I see this claim without a number, it&#039;s never been filed because it&#039;s just some fake shit.<br /><br />Comments skimmed:<br />-Why would I pay $50 for a dissolve cap? Stupidest shit ever invinted. I doubt they even make 6 figures from this. It&#039;s a bunch of acids mixed together.<br />-making 7 already. passed sixs last week<br /><br />-THEY BOUT TO GET BIG BUCKS OFF THIS SHIT<br />-already am<br /><br />- oh its legitimate.. he just doesnt want his nobel prize.. who wants that bull..? <br />- yep screw the recognition i want the cash<br /><br />-I have seen the video but the video cuts off after zooming in on foaming inside of the bottle. it does not show the products being emptied from the bottle nor the settling of...<br />-whose got that kind of time. It would take minutes for the bubbles to settle<br /><br />- listen up Poohber.....Lol nigga u gonna have to record this again with out all the &quot;cut-away&quot; shots.....1 STEADY shot my nigga....i need to see errthing so i know its real<br />- i know but understand it is already on yootube cant post it up as it is just the video of it actually working , 1 shot no edit no cut away but if i cant put it on this site. They had to approve everything. So go search byedrugs and see it.<br /><br />- Lol guess u the 1 who invented dis bullshit?<br />-nope just social media director<br /><br />-thanks but the proper procedure is a cease and desist order which we will circumvent as we will then sell the cap and bottle with no liquid and post formula free online. We went thru this with a fine tooth comb already but great question<br /><br />-AYE YALL POOHBER IS THE DUDE TRYING TO SECRETLY PUSH HIS BOGUS PRODUCT .. HURRY UP AND DONT BUY!<br />-yes and yes, run dont walk. Yall dont need this cause there are over 200000 views already so you Prometheus I could give 2 fucks about, this is my attempt at not letting idiots sway the few that care to read these threads. Guess what it works, over 20k orders in 3 days. <br /><br />- dude ur arguing with so many ppl ur not making any sense.. sorry buddy&nbsp; try again lol<br />-whose arguing, Im explaining in the same breathe. You speak like an idiot I answer and respond in kind. thats called mirroring. Marketing 101<br /><br />-why does it not dissolve the plastic bottles? why does it not react violently when in aluminum bottles (muriatic acid explodes with aluminum)<br />-not alum, stainless steel and the plastic bottles are fluorinated on the inside (think clorox, chlorine, muriatic acid etc)<br /><br />-it was filmed in some dudes kitchen, fake<br />-no lab table<br /><br />-when acid dissolve anything...theres a cloud/smoke of toxin that comes up from whatever&nbsp; its eating away...unless this came with an air filter when he open the bottle smoke should come out<br />-not so as they have acids with no sulfur and no fumes.<br /><br />-u can&#039;t get ppl acid like that to disolve sh8...its illegal...and how many case of acid comes with this bottle....#fuck_outta_here<br />-no cases of acid, and yes the acids portion is readily available at most pool stores or hardware stores. Go walk into Home Depot and ask for odorless Muraitic Acid. Sold by the gallon for $3.00 used in pools anyone can buy. Take the jug and pour on plastic bottles and see what happens <br /><br />-I appreciate it, granted if you got a pile of stuff your screwed but this will hold a hell of alot, 8th of an ounce and up, over 100 pills etc. If you roll with the container and the cap inside then simply press down on the cap and your golden. The time it would take you to turn off your car radio.<br /><br />-no water its actually acid and it does not have traces of drugs. If the cop on the street tests it no. If they send it to a lab to be tested it might depending on time frame. The longer it sits in the liquid the more its dissolving and breaking down. It takes them hours to book you and drive to station in process etc and then they send it to lab if its at night forget it your golden.<br /><br />-Will the acid burn yo hand? And what if police smell the liquid, does it have a smell? Can they test the liquid for drugs, what will happen?<br />-no smell and will burn if left on your hand for extended period of time. I rinse my hand and its fine but it does burn but tingles first.<br /><br />-genius, youll make a killing. Who said going to college pays, look at you, only 3rd grade education and you come up with a patentable idea. Now give Patent Attorney $34,000 to test and run your patent thru and see if you get it approved? Or do you not have the cash or balls to waste on your brilliant idea? Ass go to sleep<br /><br />-thank you. i figured that aspect also but the acid is not all there is as it will melt the bags but not stick and seeds. Those are another animal all together and i have a provisional patent on the cap and dispensing concept. so it will be a long ass time before anyone can figure it out. (I hope)<br /><br />-ay hoe do that junk work with weed<br />-no hoe, he and yes it does, stick stems and seeds dissolve<br /><br />-This is real not a gimmick, We are chemical engineers, we did tests its all good. Period.<br /><br />-BS as the patent was filed in 12/02/12<br />http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhG5L16IAwg3dDzh91#disqus_thread<br /><br />Registered through: GoDaddy.com, LLC (http://www.godaddy.com)<br />Domain Name: BYEBOTTLE.COM<br />Created on: 03-Aug-12<br />Expires on: 03-Aug-13<br />Last Updated on: 03-Aug-12<br /><br />Registrant:<br />edouard joseph<br />990 stinson way<br />#212<br />West Palm Beach, Florida 33411<br />United States<br /><br />Administrative Contact:<br />joseph, edouard ejoseph@princereigns.com<br />990 stinson way<br />#212<br />West Palm Beach, Florida 33411<br />United States<br />(866) 774-6234<br /><br />Technical Contact:<br />joseph, edouard ejoseph@princereigns.com<br />990 stinson way<br />#212<br />West Palm Beach, Florida 33411<br />United States<br />(866) 774-6234<br /><br /><br />Registered in the name of edouard joseph<br />http://josephsquared.com/<br />JOSEPH2.NET<br />...<br /><br /><br />Registered through: GoDaddy.com, LLC (http://www.godaddy.com)<br />Domain Name: BYEDRUGS.COM<br />Created on: 12-Jan-12<br />Expires on: 12-Jan-15<br />Last Updated on: 13-Oct-12<br /><br />Registrant:<br />Domains By Proxy, LLC<br /><br />DomainsByProxy.com<br />14747 N Northsight Blvd Suite 111, PMB 309<br />Scottsdale, Arizona 85260<br />United States<br /><br />Administrative Contact:<br />Private, Registration BYEDRUGS.COM@domainsbyproxy.com<br />Domains By Proxy, LLC<br />DomainsByProxy.com<br />14747 N Northsight Blvd Suite 111, PMB 309<br /><br />Registered through: GoDaddy.com, LLC (http://www.godaddy.com)<br />Domain Name: PRINCEREIGNS.COM<br />Created on: 22-Feb-01<br />Expires on: 22-Feb-15<br />Last Updated on: 20-Apr-09<br /><br />Registrant:<br />marc adam<br />P.O.
