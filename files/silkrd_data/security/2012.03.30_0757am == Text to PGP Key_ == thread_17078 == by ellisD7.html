				Title: <strong>Text to PGP Key?</strong><br />

				I must admit I am an extreme noob when it comes to this PGP stuff. I downloaded the program PortablePGP for my Mac OS10.5 since the standard PGP tools won&#039;t run all the programs on lower than 10.6. I figured out how to use the program, but my question is, how do I import a seller&#039;s public key? Do I save the text as a certain type of file extension?

				I use Linux but I imagine the process is similar on OSX.<br /><br />You need to save the seller&#039;s key as a text file and then from your PGP program you should have an &quot;Import&quot; option. Just navigate to where you saved the text file and select it for import. You should then get a confirmation box pop up box and the key will appear in your keyring.

				Thank you, I&#039;ve tried doing that but maybe I am saving it as the wrong file extension? I tried .rtf and .doc and when I try to import I get the error: &quot;public key ring doesn&#039;t start with public key tag: tag 0xxfffffff

				It sounds like your keyring might be corrupted for some reason, can you reinstall it?<br />It could be worth downloading it again and starting from scratch.<br />I do not believe the filetype will affect anything, I save mine without an extension and it works just fine.

				I just tried to import it into the standard GPGTools Keychain application, (not the PGPPortable App) and it wouldn&#039;t accept file extensions of .rtf or .doc. :/

				I had the exact same problem. It was because I didn&#039;t copy the whole key (missed the BEGIN/ END).<br /><br />I can&#039;t figure out what to do after I encrypt. Do I just paste the encrypted text into the vendor&#039;s private message box?

				I did include the begin/end and no dice. My GPG Keychain Access program that comes with PGPTools won&#039;t import it unless its a certain GPG file extension because it won&#039;t even let me click it when I try to import it. My tool that I used to generate my key still gives me the error message. I think I might just give up on my old mac and use my PC. It seems a lot more straightforward than going through all this bs

				My advice to you is to set up a virtual machine on your Mac running Windows or Linux, on which you can store your PGP keys and Bitcoin info. If you need help setting one up, I can give you some links with instructions.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17078.msg170472#msg170472">Quote from: ellisD7 on March 31, 2012, 02:58 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I did include the begin/end and no dice.
