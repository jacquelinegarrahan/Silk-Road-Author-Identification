Coming soon<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @-}-,-`- -<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=========================================================================================<br /><br /><br />You&#039;ll need a USB flashdrive that has at least a 500MB capacity. I bought a 4GB USB flashdrive at a Best Buy for $7.<br />Download Liberte Linux from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/liberte/files/snapshots/liberte-snapshot-20120229.zip/download<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 1: Creating your liveUSB<br /><br />1. Format the USB<br /><br />Find the icon for your USB in Windows Explorer. Right-click on it and select the &quot;Format&quot; option. Make sure the &quot;File System&quot; option is set to &quot;FAT32&quot;.<br />Hit &quot;Start&quot; and wait a few seconds for it to finish (time depends on capacity of flashdrive).<br /><br /><br />2. Install Liberte to USB<br /><br />Extract the &quot;.zip&quot; you just downloaded to the root of your USB flashdrive. Open the &quot;liberte&quot; folder, right-click over &quot;setup.bat&quot; and select &quot;Run as <br />administrator&quot;. The batch file will do its thing and will prompt you with a &quot;Press any key to continue...&quot; message once it&#039;s done.<br /><br /><br />3. Boot from USB<br /><br />Now shut down your computer. To be able to boot from a USB flashdrive, you will have to change some settings in the BIOS. To access the BIOS, power-on<br />your computer and press whichever key is specified on your screen (usually something like &quot;Press F12 to access Boot menu...&quot;). Using the arrow keys,<br />scroll over to the &quot;Boot&quot; tab. Scroll down to the option &quot;USB HDD: YOUR USB&#039;s NAME HERE&quot; and move it to the top of the list. Save changes and exit.<br /><br /><br />4. Using Liberte<br /><br />The first time you boot Liberte will be really slow because it has to create an encrypted key for you. The loading bar will stop at about 3/4ths of the way,<br />pause for around 10 minutes, then you&#039;ll be prompted to enter a password for your system, at which point a hash will be generated for the password<br />which could also take around 10 minutes. Just sit tight, you&#039;ll be able to use your new configuration very soon. <br /><br />Once you get in, establish an internet connection by clicking on the first icon to the left of the time (lower-left corner). To access the onion network click<br />on the computer monitor icon (lower-right corner), hover over to &quot;Internet&quot; and select &quot;Midori&quot;. In this same menu you have the ability to switch your Tor <br />identity, as well as a non-Torified browser for connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots.<br /><br />Whenever you&#039;re done using Liberte, close out of all your applications and shut down by going back over to the computer icon and hitting &quot;Logout&quot;.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @-}-,-`- -<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 2: Bitcoins, GPG, Mail<br /><br />1. Getting Bitcoins<br /><br />People all have their own methods on how to get bitcoins, but here&#039;s how I do it which works great and is completely anonymous. Also this is only for the <br />United States as far as I know.<br /><br />First create a Mt Gox account. Mt Gox is a great bitcoin exchange but they now unfortunately flag anyone accessing their site through Tor. So I went to <br />my local library and made my Mt Gox there. Use a disposable e-mail to sign up for Mt Gox and make sure to only access it at a computer not associated <br />with you (such as the library). Write down your Mt Gox account number, as you&#039;ll need it in the next step.<br /><br />Now go to &quot;bitinstant.com&quot;. This is a middle-man service that lets you deposit cash at a local bank and get bitcoins in your Mt Gox account within <br />MINUTES. Select &quot;Cash Bank Deposit&quot; as the payment method, &quot;Mt. Gox&quot; as the destination, type in your account number as the destination account, <br />and lastly put an e-mail that IS NOT the e-mail you used to create your Mt Gox account (I would suggest getting a Tormail). The bottom of the page will<br />give you a quote with the amount you will receive after their fees have been subtracted.<br /><br />Hit &quot;Send Funds&quot;. Then press the big green &quot;Click to Pay Now&quot; button. You&#039;ll be redirected to the TrustCash website. Go through the steps and make sure<br />to print a copy of your invoice at the last page. You have 3 days to deposit the cash before the invoice will expire. Take the invoice to the bank you <br />chose in the steps, tell the teller you&#039;d like to deposit the money into the account detailed on the invoice, and hand him/her the exact amount specified. <br />If he/she starts asking questions, just say you&#039;re trying to get started in the forex trading market.<br /><br /><br />2. Moving Bitcoins<br /><br />By the time you get home (or back to the library), you&#039;ll get an e-mail with a Mt Gox redeemable code for your bitcoins. Again make sure you access Mt <br />Gox from a computer not in any way connected to you. At this point you should send the funds through a couple of instawallets. ABSOLUTELY MAKE <br />SURE YOU BOOKMARK THE INSTAWALLET ADDRESSES!!! EVEN WRITE THEM DOWN!!! You can also put the coins through a tumbling service like BitcoinFog, but I don&#039;t find it necessary. The fact that the coins can&#039;t be linked to you in the first place is what really matters. Whenever you&#039;re happy with the degree<br />to which your coins have been obscured, transfer your funds into your Silk Road wallet.<br /><br /><br />3. Buying on Silk Road<br /><br />No vendor will allow you to stay in escrow until you have at least 5 purchases. To solve this just go over to the digital goods section and buy 5 books. <br /><br />Once you have a history, find a product you&#039;re interested in (mmm, Mushrooms ;P) and add it to your cart. SR is a lot like Amazon so the procedure <br />shouldn&#039;t be too much of a mystery for anyone. Select a shipping option (it almost always costs extra, so keep that in mind with the price of the product),<br />enter in your information (encrypted of course! see the next section on how to use PGP) and hit buy.<br /><br />If you have over 5 purchases, do not EVER finalize early, even for trusted vendors. If a vendor tells you that you have to finalize in order to have your order<br />sent, demand them to cancel your order. The escrow system is the ONLY way for SR to protect your money and SR is not responsible if you finalize<br />early and get scammed.<br /><br /><br />4. Using GPG <br /><br />GPG stands for Gnu Privacy Guard. It is a free replacement for PGP, which was recently bought by Symantec and now costs money. Liberte comes with<br />GPG pre-configured. To use it, hit the computer icon, and under &quot;System Tools&quot; select &quot;gpa&quot;.<br /><br />The first time you open up &quot;gpa&quot; you&#039;ll have to create a keypair. Enter in your SR name, your tormail as the contact, and a strong password. Create a <br />backup copy of your private key and save it to &quot;persist&gt;security&gt;pgp&quot; for now (I highly recommend saving it on Tormail and deleting it off of your USB).<br /><br />To encrypt a message with pgp, first find the public key of the person you want to send the message to. Save that key as a file and import that to gpa<br />with the &quot;Import&quot; button. Now press the &quot;Clipboard&quot; button, type your message, and hit &quot;Encrypt&quot;. Choose the key of the person you&#039;re sending the <br />message to and your message will become encrypted. Unless you want to get an encrypted message back, you don&#039;t have to include your public key.<br /><br /><br />5. Receiving Packages<br /><br />Always use the real name of a person registered at the house you are sending to. The Post Office checks to make sure the two match up, they&#039;ll realize somethings up when they get a package to &quot;John Smith&quot; at a random street. Don&#039;t spell your name slightly wrong either as again that can raise a flag at the post office. I recommend getting a friend to pick up packages for you (always ask him/her first!).<br /><br />Once you get the package, write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; in big red letters with a marker across the package. Wait 1 day, and if the police don&#039;t come banging down your door then you should be fine. Never use your product at the house you received it at. I also recommend only buying personal amounts as local law enforcement doesn&#039;t have the time or resources to bust someone getting an 1/8th of weed in the mail. If they do catch it, they&#039;ll probably just send you a love letter. Freakonomics (a popular book) showed that most street level drug dealers make less than minimum wage, so buying ounces of stuff off of SR is really not that worth it.<br /><br />If the police does come knocking, DENY that the package is yours. Remember that anyone can send you drugs in the mail. Don&#039;t consent to any searches, don&#039;t say much at all, call your lawyer and let his expensive lips do the talking.<br /><br />To Be Continued....................<br />

				Very nice.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll be switching my method of obtaining BTC very soon.&nbsp; Fuck MoneyPaks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you think encrypting a USB with TrueCrypt, and making a dummy key is sufficient?

				what exactly do you mean by saying a portable version of true crypt doesn&#039;t let you do what you need to?<br />great tutorial by the way.<br />I&#039;m outside of USA so i cant really use that way of getting bitcoins but tell me what do you think of the following:<br />i got a friend that knows I&#039;m using SR he&#039;s trustworthy.<br />If he buys the bitcoins for me and then sends them to my wallet, afterwards i use bitcoinfog to tumble them coins and send them to sr.<br />that breaks the chain of ownership and seems pretty secure to me as the shipments arrive to My address and not his.

				Going to the library is very DUMB !!! That&#039;s the last place you want to use the computer. First, you have to be registered to use the computers. That means you have to give an ID. You also have to sign up to use the computer. Nowadys libraries have cameras. Second, All internet activity is monitored and filtered. Using the library is the worst advise someone can give you !

I actually saw BTC Buddy which is on SR &amp; he will take MP for BTC exchange at no fee USD to USD. MP is $5 to load. send him number &amp; he sends you btc quicker then mt gox would. I haven&#039;t used this method yet, is this not better? completely no connections to anyone. You pay cash for MP (assuming no id needed) then send code to no name person &amp; get btc from random act this doesn&#039;t require all the hoops of the OPs method. Only question is do money packs require id for say up to $1K? what is max you can load on one?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.msg152099#msg152099">Quote from: happyroller1234 on March 15, 2012, 06:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do you think encrypting a USB with TrueCrypt, and making a dummy key is sufficient?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think the proper way to use Truecrypt which is what i&#039;m setting up this weekend, is to completely format your harddrive with at least one zeroing or random pass. There is a great blog (anti-forensics) which states more than one pass on modern media isn&#039;t needed really, but you can to be safe. You need to install a &quot;decoy&quot; operating system &quot;A&quot;. after that&#039;s installed, do a complete system encryption from Truecrypt. After that you want to install a 2nd hidden parititon/OS. This will be your SR/Tor/Everything-you-want-hidden OS. Use decoy system to store a few fake pgp messages signed with fake keys and crap &amp; set one password. Set your 2nd hidden os with a COMPLETELY different password. Depending on what password is used during bootloader will determine what os is started either your decoy or hidden. This is the best thing in the world because if you ever did get investigated I&#039;m sure nowadays a court could force you to reveal passwords for shit like this, so you give them that password for your decoy system. Because your hidden os/2nd os is in fact hidden no one can see that it exists within your decoy system. Also refer to that blog for how to remove the words truecrypt loader from the bootloader &amp; replace with words windows booloader to make more secure.<br /><br />Then if we want to get crazy with shit, i&#039;m going to run 2 windows 7 installs, one for decoy, one for hidden. From within my hidden OS set (correct) virtualization &amp; run liberte from within your hidden os &amp; access tor/SR off that. Now if ever a trace of anything leaked or was saved from liberte it would be hidden in single, double, triple encryption (whichever you choose).<br /><br />All the portable version of Truecrypt does is let you make an encrypted container to store a text document for instance in. What makes it really shine is the hidden os that gives you plausible deniability, in that if forced for WHATEVER reason to give up your password you can w/o being compromised.<br /><br />However having liberte on a flash drive for using on random PCs when you don&#039;t have your main Truecrypt encrypted rig wether this be desktop or laptop, does make a handy tool in your arsenal.<br /><br />Edit:Just went &amp; google&#039;d it, no id needed for MP AFAIK. Again, wouldn&#039;t my method be more secure &amp; less cumbersome?

				Just to clear up a few questions people have had:<br /><br />1. Truecrypt simply doesn&#039;t work very well on a USB. Get over it people...<br />2. With the method of getting bitcoins I described, you do not have to have a bank account. You simply deposit your money. The only non-anonymous part is you&#039;ll be on the bank&#039;s cameras, so just wear a hat or something.<br />3. You don&#039;t need to be a registered user to access computers at most libraries. I always just ask for a &quot;Guest Pass&quot;. And last time I checked its not illegal to use Mt Gox at a library... or anywhere for that matter.<br />4. Again truecrypt does not work well on USBs... Liberte has solid encryption called LUKS so really believe me ya&#039;ll will be fine. As long as you don&#039;t keep any sensitive information on the USB in the first place then you don&#039;t even need to worry about having it encrypted in the first place.<br />5. I have a feeling people don&#039;t even know what truecrypt does... it only protects you if your harddrive or USB was stolen and someone tries to look at your files... it&#039;s not a firewall or anonymity device of some sort...<br />6. To use portable Truecrypt, you have to have Truecrypt fully installed on whatever machine you are booting from to decrypt the contents of the USB. If you ever have to use your USB from a machine that doesn&#039;t have Truecrypt installed... well you have yourself a slight problem.<br />7. Again I don&#039;t recommend using bitcoin fog. As long as you can&#039;t be traced to buying the bitcoins in the first place, you don&#039;t have to worry about obscuring the bitcoin trail very much. Also SR has its own bitcoin tumbler as soon as you make a purchase.<br />8. Guys, don&#039;t use Money Paks... it&#039;s SO EASY to get scammed. The vendor can just say that your code didn&#039;t work and they&#039;ll just steal your money and fuck you over. And if you don&#039;t, the rates on SR are CRAZY. Last time I checked, Suga_Mama charged like 17% for MPs under $100...

I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much, but for the West Coast of he US, there is no way to use their libraries with out photo ID.<br /><br />I lived in my van with 2 beautiful Lab sisters for a couple of years and just traversed the West Coast, north to south and then back again. This was from 2007 to 2009. Even the very small towns that had a library required ID, photo passport or other state accepted photo ID to use their computers.&nbsp; What part of the US do you live in John?<br /><br />Just wanted to clarify from personal experience and not from a post. The whole idea is to get no more contradictions, right? Even if it gets there little by little. Verified correction after verified correction. I love being able to see something I actually have personal long term experience about ANYTHING here. Quite rare I assure you all!<br /><br />Thanx for the directions John!

				Thank you again<br /><br />To recap, I went to B of A where the teller took my cash and that was it. The money went straight to Mt.

This was at a different location.<br /><br />Ideas about the &quot;out of state&quot; slip have appeared here before, in the forums. I read them over the summer.

				Hello.&nbsp; Thanks for posting this!&nbsp; This is my first forum post but I&#039;ve been lurking around SR for a little while, trying to research things before rushing into anything.&nbsp; Anyway, following your guide here I just downloaded liberte and extracted it to my USB drive, ran the setup, and booted from the USB drive. But I&#039;m having trouble connecting to the internet.&nbsp; I use a laptop pc to connect to a home wireless internet connection.&nbsp; I tried to enable wireless in liberte, but it didn&#039;t seem to do anything. The limited info I&#039;ve been able to find seems to indicate that many wireless adapters aren&#039;t compatible with linux.&nbsp; Am I just doin it wrong, or do you think it&#039;s likely a hardware issue?&nbsp; I&#039;m really not trying to waste your time, but I&#039;m not sure where to look for a basic crash course on using liberte.&nbsp; The wiki linked in the readme seems geared towards people far more advanced than myself at being shady on teh interwebs.&nbsp;

				great guide john. it was seriously helpful. now having said that i have encountered a hiccup in the process of booting liberte. <br /><br />i got up to the point where i make a password and it generates a key. then the bar fully loads up and then the screen just goes black. i let it stay like that for about an hour thinking it just needed some time but it just stayed as a black screen.<br /><br />do you have any insight on this? i am pretty confident i followed your instructions carefully and correctly. thanks for the help.

The second time, when I went to deposit money at Bank of America with the Trust Fund invoice, the nice lady at the counter asked for a out of state deposit slip.<br /><br />Knowing that its been covered, does anyone have fresh advice or point the way to what to do when asked for an &quot;out of state&quot; deposit slip?

I assume you used trustcash to make the deposit... so... when you go to bank just ask for the out of state deposit slip up front (i always do it this way). The name/address/phone and business state that you write down is the one that is on the trustcash invoice, along with the acct and routing numbers of the &#039;business acct&#039; that you are depositing into....&nbsp; It IS NOT asking for your personal information... none of your personal info is needed for this kind of deposit to get bitcoins.&nbsp; I try to go to a different bank each time I deposit, walk right in and politey ask for the out of state deposit slip, i pull up my email with the invoice info and just copy it right down, hand over the cash and make a comment about &quot;how great the weather is lately&quot;, i get my receipt for the transaction and im out the door. if i havent recieved the confirmation email in the next hour or so i just call the 1800 number to verify the deposit was made and then poof! usd is ready to trade for btc

				After you get everything up in Virtualbox or VMware you save the snapshot. Go find the .VDI file or whatever VMware saves it as and put it in a Truecrypt container. Good enough for just buying. <br /><br />If you really want crazy security can always buy an Ironkey and store your .VDI files on it inside a TC container. Double encrypted.<br />

Coming soon<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @-}-,-`- -<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=========================================================================================<br /><br /><br />You&#039;ll need a USB flashdrive that has at least a 500MB capacity. I bought a 4GB USB flashdrive at a Best Buy for $7.<br />Download Liberte Linux from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/liberte/files/snapshots/liberte-snapshot-20120229.zip/download<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 1: Creating your liveUSB<br /><br />1. Format the USB<br /><br />Find the icon for your USB in Windows Explorer. Right-click on it and select the &quot;Format&quot; option. Make sure the &quot;File System&quot; option is set to &quot;FAT32&quot;.<br />Hit &quot;Start&quot; and wait a few seconds for it to finish (time depends on capacity of flashdrive).<br /><br /><br />2. Install Liberte to USB<br /><br />Extract the &quot;.zip&quot; you just downloaded to the root of your USB flashdrive. Open the &quot;liberte&quot; folder, right-click over &quot;setup.bat&quot; and select &quot;Run as <br />administrator&quot;. The batch file will do its thing and will prompt you with a &quot;Press any key to continue...&quot; message once it&#039;s done.<br /><br /><br />3. Boot from USB<br /><br />Now shut down your computer. To be able to boot from a USB flashdrive, you will have to change some settings in the BIOS. To access the BIOS, power-on<br />your computer and press whichever key is specified on your screen (usually something like &quot;Press F12 to access Boot menu...&quot;). Using the arrow keys,<br />scroll over to the &quot;Boot&quot; tab. Scroll down to the option &quot;USB HDD: YOUR USB&#039;s NAME HERE&quot; and move it to the top of the list. Save changes and exit.<br /><br /><br />4. Using Liberte<br /><br />The first time you boot Liberte will be really slow because it has to create an encrypted key for you. The loading bar will stop at about 3/4ths of the way,<br />pause for around 10 minutes, then you&#039;ll be prompted to enter a password for your system, at which point a hash will be generated for the password<br />which could also take around 10 minutes. Just sit tight, you&#039;ll be able to use your new configuration very soon. <br /><br />Once you get in, establish an internet connection by clicking on the first icon to the left of the time (lower-left corner). To access the onion network click<br />on the computer monitor icon (lower-right corner), hover over to &quot;Internet&quot; and select &quot;Midori&quot;. In this same menu you have the ability to switch your Tor <br />identity, as well as a non-Torified browser for connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots.<br /><br />Whenever you&#039;re done using Liberte, close out of all your applications and shut down by going back over to the computer icon and hitting &quot;Logout&quot;.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @-}-,-`- -<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 2: Bitcoins, GPG, Mail<br /><br />1. Getting Bitcoins<br /><br />People all have their own methods on how to get bitcoins, but here&#039;s how I do it which works great and is completely anonymous. Also this is only for the <br />United States as far as I know.<br /><br />First create a Mt Gox account. Mt Gox is a great bitcoin exchange but they now unfortunately flag anyone accessing their site through Tor. So I went to <br />my local library and made my Mt Gox there. Use a disposable e-mail to sign up for Mt Gox and make sure to only access it at a computer not associated <br />with you (such as the library). Write down your Mt Gox account number, as you&#039;ll need it in the next step.<br /><br />Now go to &quot;bitinstant.com&quot;. This is a middle-man service that lets you deposit cash at a local bank and get bitcoins in your Mt Gox account within <br />MINUTES. Select &quot;Cash Bank Deposit&quot; as the payment method, &quot;Mt. Gox&quot; as the destination, type in your account number as the destination account, <br />and lastly put an e-mail that IS NOT the e-mail you used to create your Mt Gox account (I would suggest getting a Tormail). The bottom of the page will<br />give you a quote with the amount you will receive after their fees have been subtracted.<br /><br />Hit &quot;Send Funds&quot;. Then press the big green &quot;Click to Pay Now&quot; button. You&#039;ll be redirected to the TrustCash website. Go through the steps and make sure<br />to print a copy of your invoice at the last page. You have 3 days to deposit the cash before the invoice will expire. Take the invoice to the bank you <br />chose in the steps, tell the teller you&#039;d like to deposit the money into the account detailed on the invoice, and hand him/her the exact amount specified. <br />If he/she starts asking questions, just say you&#039;re trying to get started in the forex trading market.<br /><br /><br />2. Moving Bitcoins<br /><br />By the time you get home (or back to the library), you&#039;ll get an e-mail with a Mt Gox redeemable code for your bitcoins. Again make sure you access Mt <br />Gox from a computer not in any way connected to you. At this point you should send the funds through a couple of instawallets. ABSOLUTELY MAKE <br />SURE YOU BOOKMARK THE INSTAWALLET ADDRESSES!!! EVEN WRITE THEM DOWN!!! You can also put the coins through a tumbling service like BitcoinFog, but I don&#039;t find it necessary. The fact that the coins can&#039;t be linked to you in the first place is what really matters. Whenever you&#039;re happy with the degree<br />to which your coins have been obscured, transfer your funds into your Silk Road wallet.<br /><br /><br />3. Buying on Silk Road<br /><br />No vendor will allow you to stay in escrow until you have at least 5 purchases. To solve this just go over to the digital goods section and buy 5 books. <br /><br />Once you have a history, find a product you&#039;re interested in (mmm, Mushrooms ;P) and add it to your cart. SR is a lot like Amazon so the procedure <br />shouldn&#039;t be too much of a mystery for anyone. Select a shipping option (it almost always costs extra, so keep that in mind with the price of the product),<br />enter in your information (encrypted of course! see the next section on how to use PGP) and hit buy.<br /><br />If you have over 5 purchases, do not EVER finalize early, even for trusted vendors. If a vendor tells you that you have to finalize in order to have your order<br />sent, demand them to cancel your order. The escrow system is the ONLY way for SR to protect your money and SR is not responsible if you finalize<br />early and get scammed.<br /><br /><br />4. Using GPG <br /><br />GPG stands for Gnu Privacy Guard. It is a free replacement for PGP, which was recently bought by Symantec and now costs money. Liberte comes with<br />GPG pre-configured. To use it, hit the computer icon, and under &quot;System Tools&quot; select &quot;gpa&quot;.<br /><br />The first time you open up &quot;gpa&quot; you&#039;ll have to create a keypair. Enter in your SR name, your tormail as the contact, and a strong password. Create a <br />backup copy of your private key and save it to &quot;persist&gt;security&gt;pgp&quot; for now (I highly recommend saving it on Tormail and deleting it off of your USB).<br /><br />To encrypt a message with pgp, first find the public key of the person you want to send the message to. Save that key as a file and import that to gpa<br />with the &quot;Import&quot; button. Now press the &quot;Clipboard&quot; button, type your message, and hit &quot;Encrypt&quot;. Choose the key of the person you&#039;re sending the <br />message to and your message will become encrypted. Unless you want to get an encrypted message back, you don&#039;t have to include your public key.<br /><br /><br />5. Receiving Packages<br /><br />Always use the real name of a person registered at the house you are sending to. The Post Office checks to make sure the two match up, they&#039;ll realize somethings up when they get a package to &quot;John Smith&quot; at a random street. Don&#039;t spell your name slightly wrong either as again that can raise a flag at the post office. I recommend getting a friend to pick up packages for you (always ask him/her first!).<br /><br />Once you get the package, write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; in big red letters with a marker across the package. Wait 1 day, and if the police don&#039;t come banging down your door then you should be fine. Never use your product at the house you received it at. I also recommend only buying personal amounts as local law enforcement doesn&#039;t have the time or resources to bust someone getting an 1/8th of weed in the mail. If they do catch it, they&#039;ll probably just send you a love letter. Freakonomics (a popular book) showed that most street level drug dealers make less than minimum wage, so buying ounces of stuff off of SR is really not that worth it.<br /><br />If the police does come knocking, DENY that the package is yours. Remember that anyone can send you drugs in the mail. Don&#039;t consent to any searches, don&#039;t say much at all, call your lawyer and let his expensive lips do the talking.<br /><br />To Be Continued....................<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is there one for Mac Users?

In any case there is really no need. I access MtGox all the time from my office as I trade in Bitcoins which is perfectly legal. <br /><br />If you&#039;re feeling particularly paranoid there are other ways to keep your connection private besides using Tor (I have posted on a separate thread about using an encrypted SSH tunnel for instance) but I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you were under Police survevillance (which is very unlikely), and they were able to obtain a court order from your ISP to look at what sites you&#039;ve been visiting, which once again would be extremely unlikely. All they could tell was that you had accessed the MtGox website. Your connection is secured by SSL, so they wouldn&#039;t even be able to tell which account was in your name, let alone how many Bitcoins you&#039;re buying or where you&#039;re sending them.<br /><br />But let&#039;s say you&#039;re one unlucky guy and they manage to get a Judge to seize MtGox&#039;s servers and get hold of your account details - all they would be able to prove is that you bought some Bitcoins. Even if you have transferred them to your wallet on SR they have no way of telling the difference between BTC addresses belonging to SR from any other.<br /><br />The worst they could do if they managed to get hold of this information is trace the passage of the Bitcoins you bought through MtGox through the network but even then that proves nothing in itself. Sellers on SR have a &quot;mixer&quot; built into their accounts so that Bitcoins are shuffled around before being withdrawn, so it wouldn&#039;t be possible to know what you had bought on SR by analysing transactions, nor where your Bitcoins went after they got there. <br /><br />This is why I don&#039;t feel at all worried about buying Bitcoins with my own bank account and accessing MtGox from my office as in themselves they are perfectly legal activities - for now at least. :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				This is a great topic, it always amazes me that people buy anything from SR without using liberte (or at least a live cd/usb). Liberte has the added security advantage that it is encrypted already.<br /><br />As I see it the real weak point in this whole system is the ability of LE to link a given bank account to you as a person. Thus I&nbsp; doubt it would be a good idea to access SR from my native OS and home IP (I use my home IP at the moment while I am reading the forums &amp; will discard this username when I actually go on to get something), a public wifi couldn&#039;t hurt either. Also when transferring BTC around it might be worthwhile changing tor circuits and using the mac changer in liberte between each transaction. The number of movements and use of laundries is entirely dependent on personal preference and level of paranoia.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess even if the worst scenario occurs and your seller gets busted and stupidly has not yet wiped your info (or not wiped it securely), or has done so but gives up the password to the authorities (under threat of 5 years jail time in the uk) then all they have is your name and address. While this might bring some scrutiny onto you, if you have been careful it doesn&#039;t mean its all over (you may want to move before ordering again though :P)<br /><br />For more specific issue of getting bitcoins anonymously in the uk,&nbsp; vlad1m1r has mentioned previously that barclays bank allow cash deposits to mt. gox, this allows an end to end secure method of getting bitcoins. Now if only someone can devise a secure method of delivery we&#039;re all set.<br />

Intersango did have a Lloyds TSB account but now they use Metro bank - unfortunately there isn&#039;t one near where I live but I use my own bank account to buy BTC as I only use them for trading purposes and not to buy illegal goods - others amongst you might want to be more cautious.<br /><br />As I mentioned, you can switch your currency of choice to GBP in MtGox and receive the details for a Barclays account. It is possible to pay in cash over the counter but I should stress I did this a couple of times with Barclays in the past for paying my rent and they failed to put in the reference code on my deposit slip unless I asked them specifically.<br /><br />There are deposit points in every branch whereby you can put cash into an envelope and pay in which would be fairly anonymous but personally I&#039;d be worried they wouldn&#039;t record your unique reference no. If it would help, next week I will try to deposit a small sum (say Â£10) in this way using a deposit point rather than over the counter&nbsp; - shall I let you all know if goes through? Perhaps I just had a couple of bovine cashiers...<br /><br />At the end of the month I intend to set up a seller account - one of the services I am going to offer to UK/European SR user is BTC in exchange for cash in the mail which I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll agree would offer you the best level of protection as you wouldn&#039;t have to walk into a bank full of security cameras to get your coins. <br /><br />I&#039;m not allowed to advertise this as a specific service until I own a seller account but if anyone wants further details of how this is going to work, please send me a message. <br /><br />V.

Similarly if they&#039;re sending large amounts of cash to me to exchange for BTC I&#039;m going to suggest they send via Special Delivery (which is insured) but some people don&#039;t want to to the expense - a small price to pay for peace of mind! :-)<br /><br />The other niggling worry has to do with the BTC&#039;s volatility. I think the fairest thing to do is say that I will give buyers the BTC equivalent of the cash they send on the day it&#039;s received. <br /><br />As an alternative I was thinking instead of sending BTC, maybe sending a redeemable MtGox GBP code for a fixed amount which a buyer could cash in at their leisure and use to buy BTC when the time is right, do you think this would be a better idea? I prefer the idea of using a wallet though as it would provide proof in case a scammer tried to say they didn&#039;t get their coins.<br /><br />Obviously trust is a major issue here, I&#039;m hoping to get some good testimonials from fellow SR users during the &quot;sunrise&quot; period when I&#039;ll be offering specially discounted rates.

If you are too worried for that go get DBAN, wipe the whole drive and start again either with windows or a linux distro if you don&#039;t want to pay for another copy of windows.

For example if you use Intersango and live in the UK, you can withdraw amounts of over Â£100 to a UK bank account free of charge. BitcoinNZ in New Zealand likewise do not charge for withdrawal of NZD once you have sold BTC via their exchange. MtGox allows withdrawal by Dwolla which in turn allows you to transfer funds to your account - I don&#039;t know if they charge any withdrawal fees for this, perhaps one of our US users can confirm?<br /><br />Bear in mind that rate at which BTC are bought are less than the rate at which they are sold - and the Bitcoin can fluctuate quite a lot in value so take this into account when calculating your prices.

Or would that defeat the purpose?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi buddy,<br /><br />Yes this is perfectly feasible.<br /><br />I used to have a Windows VM on a Mac using the free program Virtualbox - and there&#039;s no reason you can&#039;t use Windows for your nefarious dealings. A few things to take into account:<br /><br />- The virtual disk image file is just as vulnerable to being seized and analysed as a regular hard disk. For this reason I&#039;d suggest using Truecrypt to perform full disk encryption on the Virtual Machine. Of course you also can (and should!) do this to your regular hard drive on your Mac too!<br />- Windows has more security holes than other Operating Systems and is more vulnerable to malware/viruses so make sure you install an effective Internet Security suite (my personal favourite is AVG free Antivirus plus the firewall Zonealarm) but my knowledge of Windows is a little dated so please anyone in the know feel free to contradict!<br />- If you decide to go ahead and do this, be careful when downloading Windows CD from torrenting websites which may have been modified to include malware. A second hand official copy of Windows XP Home Edition will set you back about $30 - a small price to pay for the peace of mind!<br /><br />Liberte Linux is also available as a virtual machine as well as a bootable USB version. It&#039;s excellent for beginners as by its very nature it&#039;s encrypted from Day 1 and all connections are immediately Torified. In addition you can&#039;t install any new programs so viruses don&#039;t get a look in. That said, the lack of Bitcoin wallet software in particular means that you&#039;ll probably want to move on from this after a while.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />

In theory an expert at digital forensics might be able to recover virtual fingerprints left by the Tor Browser to show you may have another browser running on your system but that largely depends on the Operating System you&#039;re using.<br /><br />My own set up is to use Ubuntu with an encrypted Home Folder (contains all passwords, keys, user settings etc.), inside of which there&#039;s a Truecrypt Partition. <br /><br />Just one word of caution - without using a hidden OS you won&#039;t have plausible denial when it comes to encryption so I would suggest you use Truecrypt to encode your new hard drive completely. The program will fill up the free space both with your encrypted data and random &quot;chaff&quot; data and even the most brilliant Computer Scientist wouldn&#039;t be able to tell it was encrypted by examining the data alone as many programs for wiping hard drives use a similar technique - only you, with the right password will be able to unlock it - this is only true for extenal drives though - if you encrypt your own computer&#039;s drive it will be possible to detect the Truecrypt &quot;bootloader&quot; which is necessary for entering the password. <br /><br />Since you&#039;re going to have the programs on a separate hard drive, I would also suggest that in addition to using a password to unlock the drive, have a Key File on your computer itself, which significantly increases your level of protection.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Hey, Thanks for the quick reply.<br /><br />I was reading about key files before and thinking to myself that they seem less secure? clearly I&#039;m wrong, but wouldnt having a key file on your computer be like having a password written down in the computer?<br /><br />And I was thinking because my spare hdd is 500gb and I dont need that sort of space to hold a few programs and passwords. could I just make a truecrypt container with a hidden container inside so that if I did ever get checked for it I could simply provide the wrong password and all theyll find is some porn or something? also does it matter if I have GPG4Win and my bitcoin wallet installed on the normal drives since they arent illegal programs anyway? or are they going to leave something behind?<br /><br />thanks

				Hi Sterling Archer,<br /><br />To answer your question, the key file is a layer of security to be used in addition to your password. It massively increases the security of your Truecrypt partition. If you encrypt the hard disk on your computer using Truecrypt and keep the Keyfile on there, it will mean no one can access the Truecrypt partition except you.<br /><br />By all means use a container rather than a partition but you should do as you say and have a hidden volume with some hard porn/bank details in case you&#039;re compelled to hand over the password. <br /><br />As for having GPG4WIN / Bitcoin wallet I would suggest you encrypt your hard disk with Truecrypt as I said. There&#039;s a small risk that if your computer were seized that analysing the programs would compromise your identity.<br /><br />As far as GPG is concerned an analysis of your keyring would reveal your public and private keys. At the very least it would be possible to determine who you&#039;d been in contact with. In the worst case if your private key was protected with a weak password it would be possible to decrypt e-mails to you!<br /><br />In terms of your Bitcoin client, it&#039;s true owning Bitcoins in itself isn&#039;t illegal but as the software contains the Bitcoin addresses you&#039;ve been using it would be possible to trace the passage of any coins that have passed through your wallet.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to set up a TC container, you might as well install Portable PGP / your Bitcoin wallet to there. Try to keep the size below 1GB so you can back up the container online.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.msg209022#msg209022">Quote from: SterlingArcher on April 26, 2012, 04:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hey, Thanks for the quick reply.<br /><br />I was reading about key files before and thinking to myself that they seem less secure? clearly I&#039;m wrong, but wouldnt having a key file on your computer be like having a password written down in the computer?<br /><br />And I was thinking because my spare hdd is 500gb and I dont need that sort of space to hold a few programs and passwords. could I just make a truecrypt container with a hidden container inside so that if I did ever get checked for it I could simply provide the wrong password and all theyll find is some porn or something? also does it matter if I have GPG4Win and my bitcoin wallet installed on the normal drives since they arent illegal programs anyway? or are they going to leave something behind?<br /><br />thanks<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I have successfully installed liberte onto my usb, and changed the settings so now it boots automatically when plugged into my computer. Once I get into liberte, however, and try to open midori, I get a &quot;forwarding error&quot; message and cannot access the internet. Similarly, out of curiousity, I tried to open the non-torified browser and had the same result. It says that my computer is connected to the household wifi (though a popup box asking my for the wifi password pops up every minute or so...) what am I doing wrong? I&#039;m not a particularly computer oriented person, so forgive me if I&#039;m doing something dumb.

				Ima crossposting this because I don&#039;t think the implications of it are being realized, or else it&#039;s not being read enough. Probably both. Anyway:<br /><br />SubTopic: This shows you how to anonymously use Bitcoins.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Your problem is now to disassociate yourself from the bitcoins you have purchased. You&#039;ve kinda screwed up you see unless you did what I mentioned in &#039;Future Reference&#039; below. Now you must do some work to cover your tracks. Read everything carefully.<br />--<br />For future reference:<br /><br />Ideally you should have remained anonymous right from the onset before your purchased anything. You would have to buy the bitcoins with a cash deposit at a bank *and* access the (mtgox) exchange website through a private proxy in your region of the world. You would have been using Tor to access that proxy which accesses the exchange clearnet site. I appreciate that sounds wildly complicated, but it&#039;s actually quite simple once you know how. Not only will it save you money, but it is many many times more secure. It&#039;s also less complex than what you need to do now unless you sell your coins and start over.<br />--<br /><br />Your work today:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Since you&#039;ve already bought B$ through clearnet at mtgox, you should send them to an instawallet (a one time address service offered by some B$ services online). Bookmark the instawallet URL otherwise you&#039;ll lose your money. Do not use Tor with instawallet or mtgox at this stage, that would be a red flag leading directly to you, you are assuming that both instawallet and mtgox relay all information to law enforcement and using Tor is bad news bears because mtgox will likely request a positive ID of you to release the funds citing AML requirements.<br /><br />Use Tor to find a Bitcoin laundering service, search our forums to find a reliable one. They will give you an address to send to. Don&#039;t send anything to it just yet (and note that it would take roughly a day for a mix to operate, so don&#039;t panic if it takes time, it&#039;s not instantaneous).<br /><br />Go to instawallet through clearnet and forward the coins to a Bitcoin wallet on your own computer (you need to download some bitcoin wallet software for this, you also need to torify your bitcoin wallet and download the block chain (will take a couple of hours), read this document: http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor). Now it appears that you&#039;ve paid somebody in a different country Bitcoins because your Bitcoin wallet is torified.<br /><br />Ok, now you have an option. For more security, you can use a mix (the bitcoin laundering service I mentioned, it will cost you money), or you go proceed directly to sending bitcoin from your wallet to a new instawallet which you&#039;ve accessed via Tor. Then from instawallet to the SR address you have.<br /><br />I suggest you first do this with a small amount of bitcoin to ensure this all makes sense and then you can be confident enough to do it again. At each stage you should be using a different Bitcoin address, never use the same one twice because that creates a loop, indicating that it is highly likely that any transactions in the loop are authorized by the same person.<br /><br />Yes, you could just link your mtgox a/c to your SR account. But if you read in the newspaper that the Silk Road got busted, then you&#039;re going to feel rather queasy and wish you&#039;d followed the above instructions.<br /><br />If all of this sounds like too much of a headache (albeit it would be hugely educational), then just sell the bitcoins, retrieve your money and start again. If you aren&#039;t confident enough, that would be best.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Condensed Iteration of everything above the line:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Here&#039;s the tldr; version where instructions are separated from advice:<br /><br />Future Activity:<br /><br />Cash deposit at bank to an exchange -&gt; Use Tor to access private proxy* in your country -&gt; communicate through that proxy to the exchange -&gt; convert cash to bitcoins -&gt; open an online wallet service -&gt; send bitcoins to that service -&gt; optionally put those bitcoins through a mix -&gt; send bitcoins to your SR wallet.<br /><br />--<br />If you already have bitcoins connected to your identity. e.g. used a credit card to buy, transferred from your bank account to exchange etc.<br />--<br /><br />Go onto Tor and download bitcoin wallet software -&gt;&nbsp; Printscreen http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor instructions -&gt; Turn off interweb -&gt; Install and torify your bitcoin wallet software -&gt; Turn on interweb and download the block chain to torified bitcoin wallet, now you are ready to proceed -&gt; On clearnet, access your exchange account with the bitcoins -&gt; Make an instawallet/online bitcoin wallet provider account through clearnet -&gt; transfer bitcoins from exchange to instawallet -&gt; transfer from instawallet to your torified bitcoin wallet -&gt; Open new instawallet with Tor -&gt; transfer from torified bitcoin wallet to instawallet on Tor -&gt; Optionally transfer to a bitcoin mixing service -&gt; wait a couple of hours/days -&gt; transfer from mixing service or online wallet to SR.<br /><br />Advice:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t have your clearnet browser and Tor browser open at the same time.<br />2. Never use a Bitcoin address more than once.<br />3. Search forum for bitcoin mixing services and online bitcoin wallet providers.<br />4. If you think you see flaws, you point them out. The only stupid question is one never asked.<br />5. Although the above procedures might make you more paranoid, you should really sleep a whole lot sounder since every service you&#039;ve used from the exchange to the Silk Road itself could be compromised and it wouldn&#039;t matter a whole lot.<br />6. Clearnet means being on the normal web and you&#039;re not using Tor software. Darknet is the opposite.<br />7. To torify something means that its internet traffic is being routed though the Tor network.<br />8. Don&#039;t access exchange websites with Tor, period. Unless you&#039;re doing what I described above<br />9. Don&#039;t access any website with Tor e.g. your instawallet, and then access the same web address/URL using Tor. Now instawallet knows who you are if you do.<br />10. Under no circumstances, none, forward bitcoins from A to B and then put the bitcoins back into a wallet you used earlier. This is circumstantial evidence that all bitcoin activity in that loop belongs to a single entity.<br />11. The larger the quantities being transacted, the more you want to be thinking about ferrying varying amounts of bitcoin over time with different Tor identities. I believe there is bitcoin software that can do this for you, future scheduled deposits that is, and your Tor software periodically changes identity anyway.<br /><br />* It&#039;s like the Home Cooking Channel! Here&#039;s one we made earlier!<br />

				Hey guys I&#039;m new to silk road. Just want to purchase a few small things. I had a question about this whole process though; is all this &quot;liberte&quot;,&quot;truecrypt&quot; stuff really necessary? i just want to purchase a small amount of stuff and i am not worried about my computer being stolen or anything....<br /><br />Im really just afraid of messing around with how the computer operates (saying you have to change start up options for usb and all that)

				Thank you all so much. This cleared up a lot of lil questions i had about some things. So in your guys opinion. just using Tor to access SR is not enough security wise? I plain on eventually using Liberte. and windows 7 is bad?

				Regarding covert internet access... I often just poach the available wireless networks available where ever I am, you&#039;d be surprised (or not) how many home and business networks are wide open on wireless, either default access or simply open. Multi-story office buildings are especially handy. So many networks just open to the universe....

Obviously you have to use your best judgement (hopefully good judgement) when selecting your vendors. Top 5% you can almost bet on. What I like to do is look at how many people &quot;finalized early&quot; and try to calculate how much money they are holding on to (main incentive for scamming to my knowledge). You can put this into relative perspective with Top%&#039;s and GUESS how likely they are to scam during your order.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5.

Don&#039;t spell your name slightly wrong either as again that can raise a flag at the post office. I recommend getting a friend to pick up packages for you (always ask him/her first!).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To my knowledge the USPS doesnt keep records on the current residents of the house, unlike some UK countries.<br /><br />Please let me know if i am misinformed about any of this.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Once you get the package, write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The security entitled to USPS users: unlike FedEX, UPS, etc, a special warrant is need to open up this quasi-federal mailing company&#039;s packages.

You might be able to get a refund of some sorts.<br />However, if you have the letter its a little more proof that the package got intercepted.<br /><br />Do you see how this builds trust and goes against what LE wants?<br /><br />I hope I can be disproved because this is valuable information.

When I just double-click it and it comes up though, it says that if there&#039;s an error button I should click that script and then can say to run as administrator, but that didn&#039;t happen - it just said to click any button to continue and it did its thing and that was it, so...can I still use it?

				Hi Ketchup:<br /><br />I think I had this same question when I first started. I believe you can open a new account (as we all have done when we first started) and not actually create a PIN for that account. In that case there is no pin, so you could just order by putting nothing in there. I think it would be better to create a PIN by going to your settings page and creating a PIN (since there is a space for &quot;old PIN&quot;, I guess you would leave that blank. Alternatively, and the way I remember doing it, is to create another user account with a different name and start fresh by creating a PIN from the beginning. <br />I hope this is correct and that you are on your way to having one of the most profoundly happy experiences: getting drugs in the mail :)

Probably both. Anyway:<br /><br />SubTopic: This shows you how to anonymously use Bitcoins.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Your problem is now to disassociate yourself from the bitcoins you have purchased. You&#039;ve kinda screwed up you see unless you did what I mentioned in &#039;Future Reference&#039; below. Now you must do some work to cover your tracks. Read everything carefully.<br />--<br />For future reference:<br /><br />Ideally you should have remained anonymous right from the onset before your purchased anything. You would have to buy the bitcoins with a cash deposit at a bank *and* access the (mtgox) exchange website through a private proxy in your region of the world. You would have been using Tor to access that proxy which accesses the exchange clearnet site. I appreciate that sounds wildly complicated, but it&#039;s actually quite simple once you know how. Not only will it save you money, but it is many many times more secure. It&#039;s also less complex than what you need to do now unless you sell your coins and start over.<br />--<br /><br />Your work today:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Since you&#039;ve already bought B$ through clearnet at mtgox, you should send them to an instawallet (a one time address service offered by some B$ services online). Bookmark the instawallet URL otherwise you&#039;ll lose your money. Do not use Tor with instawallet or mtgox at this stage, that would be a red flag leading directly to you, you are assuming that both instawallet and mtgox relay all information to law enforcement and using Tor is bad news bears because mtgox will likely request a positive ID of you to release the funds citing AML requirements.<br /><br />Use Tor to find a Bitcoin laundering service, search our forums to find a reliable one. They will give you an address to send to. Don&#039;t send anything to it just yet (and note that it would take roughly a day for a mix to operate, so don&#039;t panic if it takes time, it&#039;s not instantaneous).<br /><br />Go to instawallet through clearnet and forward the coins to a Bitcoin wallet on your own computer (you need to download some bitcoin wallet software for this, you also need to torify your bitcoin wallet and download the block chain (will take a couple of hours), read this document: http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor). Now it appears that you&#039;ve paid somebody in a different country Bitcoins because your Bitcoin wallet is torified.<br /><br />Ok, now you have an option. For more security, you can use a mix (the bitcoin laundering service I mentioned, it will cost you money), or you go proceed directly to sending bitcoin from your wallet to a new instawallet which you&#039;ve accessed via Tor. Then from instawallet to the SR address you have.<br /><br />I suggest you first do this with a small amount of bitcoin to ensure this all makes sense and then you can be confident enough to do it again. At each stage you should be using a different Bitcoin address, never use the same one twice because that creates a loop, indicating that it is highly likely that any transactions in the loop are authorized by the same person.<br /><br />Yes, you could just link your mtgox a/c to your SR account. But if you read in the newspaper that the Silk Road got busted, then you&#039;re going to feel rather queasy and wish you&#039;d followed the above instructions.<br /><br />If all of this sounds like too much of a headache (albeit it would be hugely educational), then just sell the bitcoins, retrieve your money and start again. If you aren&#039;t confident enough, that would be best.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Condensed Iteration of everything above the line:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Here&#039;s the tldr; version where instructions are separated from advice:<br /><br />Future Activity:<br /><br />Cash deposit at bank to an exchange -&gt; Use Tor to access private proxy* in your country -&gt; communicate through that proxy to the exchange -&gt; convert cash to bitcoins -&gt; open an online wallet service -&gt; send bitcoins to that service -&gt; optionally put those bitcoins through a mix -&gt; send bitcoins to your SR wallet.<br /><br />--<br />If you already have bitcoins connected to your identity. e.g. used a credit card to buy, transferred from your bank account to exchange etc.<br />--<br /><br />Go onto Tor and download bitcoin wallet software -&gt;&nbsp; Printscreen http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor instructions -&gt; Turn off interweb -&gt; Install and torify your bitcoin wallet software -&gt; Turn on interweb and download the block chain to torified bitcoin wallet, now you are ready to proceed -&gt; On clearnet, access your exchange account with the bitcoins -&gt; Make an instawallet/online bitcoin wallet provider account through clearnet -&gt; transfer bitcoins from exchange to instawallet -&gt; transfer from instawallet to your torified bitcoin wallet -&gt; Open new instawallet with Tor -&gt; transfer from torified bitcoin wallet to instawallet on Tor -&gt; Optionally transfer to a bitcoin mixing service -&gt; wait a couple of hours/days -&gt; transfer from mixing service or online wallet to SR.<br /><br />Advice:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t have your clearnet browser and Tor browser open at the same time.<br />2. Never use a Bitcoin address more than once.<br />3. Search forum for bitcoin mixing services and online bitcoin wallet providers.<br />4. If you think you see flaws, you point them out. The only stupid question is one never asked.<br />5. Although the above procedures might make you more paranoid, you should really sleep a whole lot sounder since every service you&#039;ve used from the exchange to the Silk Road itself could be compromised and it wouldn&#039;t matter a whole lot.<br />6. Clearnet means being on the normal web and you&#039;re not using Tor software. Darknet is the opposite.<br />7. To torify something means that its internet traffic is being routed though the Tor network.<br />8. Don&#039;t access exchange websites with Tor, period. Unless you&#039;re doing what I described above<br />9. Don&#039;t access any website with Tor e.g. your instawallet, and then access the same web address/URL using Tor. Now instawallet knows who you are if you do.<br />10. Under no circumstances, none, forward bitcoins from A to B and then put the bitcoins back into a wallet you used earlier. This is circumstantial evidence that all bitcoin activity in that loop belongs to a single entity.<br />11. The larger the quantities being transacted, the more you want to be thinking about ferrying varying amounts of bitcoin over time with different Tor identities. I believe there is bitcoin software that can do this for you, future scheduled deposits that is, and your Tor software periodically changes identity anyway.<br /><br />* It&#039;s like the Home Cooking Channel! Here&#039;s one we made earlier!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Taught me/confirmed a few things, thanks. :) <br />You get all my Karmas(not literally....of course) when I am able to give them. +&lt;3 <br /><br />Thought it deserved reposting.

				Hey guys - thanks for such an informative read. I just wanted to clarify some things around best practices for receiving. The wording used in the original post was a little sparse - is it recommended to ship to your home address with your real name? Or are we supposed to ship to someone ELSE&#039;s house and intercept the package?<br /><br />thanks!

Coming soon<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @-}-,-`- -<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=========================================================================================<br /><br /><br />You&#039;ll need a USB flashdrive that has at least a 500MB capacity. I bought a 4GB USB flashdrive at a Best Buy for $7.<br />Download Liberte Linux from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/liberte/files/snapshots/liberte-snapshot-20120229.zip/download<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 1: Creating your liveUSB<br /><br />1. Format the USB<br /><br />Find the icon for your USB in Windows Explorer. Right-click on it and select the &quot;Format&quot; option. Make sure the &quot;File System&quot; option is set to &quot;FAT32&quot;.<br />Hit &quot;Start&quot; and wait a few seconds for it to finish (time depends on capacity of flashdrive).<br /><br /><br />2. Install Liberte to USB<br /><br />Extract the &quot;.zip&quot; you just downloaded to the root of your USB flashdrive. Open the &quot;liberte&quot; folder, right-click over &quot;setup.bat&quot; and select &quot;Run as <br />administrator&quot;. The batch file will do its thing and will prompt you with a &quot;Press any key to continue...&quot; message once it&#039;s done.<br /><br /><br />3. Boot from USB<br /><br />Now shut down your computer. To be able to boot from a USB flashdrive, you will have to change some settings in the BIOS. To access the BIOS, power-on<br />your computer and press whichever key is specified on your screen (usually something like &quot;Press F12 to access Boot menu...&quot;). Using the arrow keys,<br />scroll over to the &quot;Boot&quot; tab. Scroll down to the option &quot;USB HDD: YOUR USB&#039;s NAME HERE&quot; and move it to the top of the list. Save changes and exit.<br /><br /><br />4. Using Liberte<br /><br />The first time you boot Liberte will be really slow because it has to create an encrypted key for you. The loading bar will stop at about 3/4ths of the way,<br />pause for around 10 minutes, then you&#039;ll be prompted to enter a password for your system, at which point a hash will be generated for the password<br />which could also take around 10 minutes. Just sit tight, you&#039;ll be able to use your new configuration very soon. <br /><br />Once you get in, establish an internet connection by clicking on the first icon to the left of the time (lower-left corner). To access the onion network click<br />on the computer monitor icon (lower-right corner), hover over to &quot;Internet&quot; and select &quot;Midori&quot;. In this same menu you have the ability to switch your Tor <br />identity, as well as a non-Torified browser for connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots.<br /><br />Whenever you&#039;re done using Liberte, close out of all your applications and shut down by going back over to the computer icon and hitting &quot;Logout&quot;.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @-}-,-`- -<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 2: Bitcoins, GPG, Mail<br /><br />1. Getting Bitcoins<br /><br />People all have their own methods on how to get bitcoins, but here&#039;s how I do it which works great and is completely anonymous. Also this is only for the <br />United States as far as I know.<br /><br />First create a Mt Gox account. Mt Gox is a great bitcoin exchange but they now unfortunately flag anyone accessing their site through Tor. So I went to <br />my local library and made my Mt Gox there. Use a disposable e-mail to sign up for Mt Gox and make sure to only access it at a computer not associated <br />with you (such as the library). Write down your Mt Gox account number, as you&#039;ll need it in the next step.<br /><br />Now go to &quot;bitinstant.com&quot;. This is a middle-man service that lets you deposit cash at a local bank and get bitcoins in your Mt Gox account within <br />MINUTES. Select &quot;Cash Bank Deposit&quot; as the payment method, &quot;Mt. Gox&quot; as the destination, type in your account number as the destination account, <br />and lastly put an e-mail that IS NOT the e-mail you used to create your Mt Gox account (I would suggest getting a Tormail). The bottom of the page will<br />give you a quote with the amount you will receive after their fees have been subtracted.<br /><br />Hit &quot;Send Funds&quot;. Then press the big green &quot;Click to Pay Now&quot; button. You&#039;ll be redirected to the TrustCash website. Go through the steps and make sure<br />to print a copy of your invoice at the last page. You have 3 days to deposit the cash before the invoice will expire. Take the invoice to the bank you <br />chose in the steps, tell the teller you&#039;d like to deposit the money into the account detailed on the invoice, and hand him/her the exact amount specified. <br />If he/she starts asking questions, just say you&#039;re trying to get started in the forex trading market.<br /><br /><br />2. Moving Bitcoins<br /><br />By the time you get home (or back to the library), you&#039;ll get an e-mail with a Mt Gox redeemable code for your bitcoins. Again make sure you access Mt <br />Gox from a computer not in any way connected to you. At this point you should send the funds through a couple of instawallets. ABSOLUTELY MAKE <br />SURE YOU BOOKMARK THE INSTAWALLET ADDRESSES!!! EVEN WRITE THEM DOWN!!! You can also put the coins through a tumbling service like BitcoinFog, but I don&#039;t find it necessary. The fact that the coins can&#039;t be linked to you in the first place is what really matters. Whenever you&#039;re happy with the degree<br />to which your coins have been obscured, transfer your funds into your Silk Road wallet.<br /><br /><br />3. Buying on Silk Road<br /><br />No vendor will allow you to stay in escrow until you have at least 5 purchases. To solve this just go over to the digital goods section and buy 5 books. <br /><br />Once you have a history, find a product you&#039;re interested in (mmm, Mushrooms ;P) and add it to your cart. SR is a lot like Amazon so the procedure <br />shouldn&#039;t be too much of a mystery for anyone. Select a shipping option (it almost always costs extra, so keep that in mind with the price of the product),<br />enter in your information (encrypted of course! see the next section on how to use PGP) and hit buy.<br /><br />If you have over 5 purchases, do not EVER finalize early, even for trusted vendors. If a vendor tells you that you have to finalize in order to have your order<br />sent, demand them to cancel your order. The escrow system is the ONLY way for SR to protect your money and SR is not responsible if you finalize<br />early and get scammed.<br /><br /><br />4. Using GPG <br /><br />GPG stands for Gnu Privacy Guard. It is a free replacement for PGP, which was recently bought by Symantec and now costs money. Liberte comes with<br />GPG pre-configured. To use it, hit the computer icon, and under &quot;System Tools&quot; select &quot;gpa&quot;.<br /><br />The first time you open up &quot;gpa&quot; you&#039;ll have to create a keypair. Enter in your SR name, your tormail as the contact, and a strong password. Create a <br />backup copy of your private key and save it to &quot;persist&gt;security&gt;pgp&quot; for now (I highly recommend saving it on Tormail and deleting it off of your USB).<br /><br />To encrypt a message with pgp, first find the public key of the person you want to send the message to. Save that key as a file and import that to gpa<br />with the &quot;Import&quot; button. Now press the &quot;Clipboard&quot; button, type your message, and hit &quot;Encrypt&quot;. Choose the key of the person you&#039;re sending the <br />message to and your message will become encrypted. Unless you want to get an encrypted message back, you don&#039;t have to include your public key.<br /><br /><br />5. Receiving Packages<br /><br />Always use the real name of a person registered at the house you are sending to. The Post Office checks to make sure the two match up, they&#039;ll realize somethings up when they get a package to &quot;John Smith&quot; at a random street. Don&#039;t spell your name slightly wrong either as again that can raise a flag at the post office. I recommend getting a friend to pick up packages for you (always ask him/her first!).<br /><br />Once you get the package, write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; in big red letters with a marker across the package. Wait 1 day, and if the police don&#039;t come banging down your door then you should be fine. Never use your product at the house you received it at. I also recommend only buying personal amounts as local law enforcement doesn&#039;t have the time or resources to bust someone getting an 1/8th of weed in the mail. If they do catch it, they&#039;ll probably just send you a love letter. Freakonomics (a popular book) showed that most street level drug dealers make less than minimum wage, so buying ounces of stuff off of SR is really not that worth it.<br /><br />If the police does come knocking, DENY that the package is yours. Remember that anyone can send you drugs in the mail. Don&#039;t consent to any searches, don&#039;t say much at all, call your lawyer and let his expensive lips do the talking.<br /><br />To Be Continued....................<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This was an eye opening post.&nbsp; So if someone knew nothing about security and took no steps to hide them selves while accessing Silk Roads and moving Bitcoins, should they stop what they are doing?&nbsp; Meaning not move forward with there purchase because they could be compromised. Are they placing undue risk on a seller(s) even if they have followed the delivery steps to a T?<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t want to in danger anyone with ignorance or place one&#039;s self in danger of getting caught for something small-under 1/8 of weed?

				I have this question about BTC. There is no infrastructure in my country to get anonymous BTC and only way is in the BTC market such as https://www.bitcoin.de using SEPA transfer.<br />Could anyone advise me how should I do this?<br />Right now I would:<br />Buy BTC using SEPA to instawallet then transfer them to torified wallet that wasn&#039;t accessed without Tor.<br />Then do some mixing in my Torified wallet (same wallet different address?). Should I use BTC wallet soft on my PC for this?<br />What other precautions should I take. How safe is this?<br />Mony in mail is not good, because it tends to disappear in our post offices.<br />Any advice or comment on this is highly appreciated, Thanks in advance.

				A good solution I would like to see is SR mixing incoming coins (I beleive they do for outgoing coins?).<br /><br />That would solve this whole issue.

				It is maybe a bit more secure than sending it per email, but not really.<br />Even if SR stores the address encrypted, the SW must have access to it, so anyone who can hack into SR<br />(which hopefully isn&#039;t easy ;) ), can also read your messages.<br /><br />Using GPG/PGP ensures that only the intended recipient (i.e. the person who has the private key matching the public key on the vendors profile) can decrypt the message (in theory the NSA might eb able to crack it, or if the site has already been hacked, have changed the public key, but it is certainly more secure than just sending it unencrypted).<br />Almost all vendors have PGP-keys, some only use this &quot;securenote&quot; thing (web based one-time messages), which imo doesn&#039;t really improve the security, rather it involves a 4th party you have to trust.<br />Some vendors do not use GPG at all, it&#039;s up to you to decide whether it&#039;s worth the risk to buy online from a vendor who doesn&#039;t care to learn to use GPG (a matter of hours for the purposes here).

				So apparently I fail at very simple things since John Keates laid it out so well.<br /><br />I followed his instructions exactly as written , but cannot boot off the USB stick, it just said Boot Error (thank you Liberte for being more specific lol).<br /><br />I&#039;m 100% certain it&#039;s the USB drive it&#039;s trying to boot off of cuz its called JetFlash blah blah in BIOS and it was set to the 1st priority to boot from.<br /><br />I went one step further in removing all drives (hard drive and optical drive) just to make sure, but it still&nbsp; won&#039;t boot giving that error.<br /><br />This is a new machine (well I bought it 7 months ago, i7, 6gb ram, etc. etc.) so it should boot off a USB one would think, the BIOS recognized the USB stick, but it just ... doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Does anyone have ANY idea what&#039;s wrong and how i&#039;d go about fixing it?<br /><br />Thanks.

Probably both. Anyway:<br /><br />SubTopic: This shows you how to anonymously use Bitcoins.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Your problem is now to disassociate yourself from the bitcoins you have purchased. You&#039;ve kinda screwed up you see unless you did what I mentioned in &#039;Future Reference&#039; below. Now you must do some work to cover your tracks. Read everything carefully.<br />--<br />For future reference:<br /><br />Ideally you should have remained anonymous right from the onset before your purchased anything. You would have to buy the bitcoins with a cash deposit at a bank *and* access the (mtgox) exchange website through a private proxy in your region of the world. You would have been using Tor to access that proxy which accesses the exchange clearnet site. I appreciate that sounds wildly complicated, but it&#039;s actually quite simple once you know how. Not only will it save you money, but it is many many times more secure. It&#039;s also less complex than what you need to do now unless you sell your coins and start over.<br />--<br /><br />Your work today:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Since you&#039;ve already bought B$ through clearnet at mtgox, you should send them to an instawallet (a one time address service offered by some B$ services online). Bookmark the instawallet URL otherwise you&#039;ll lose your money. Do not use Tor with instawallet or mtgox at this stage, that would be a red flag leading directly to you, you are assuming that both instawallet and mtgox relay all information to law enforcement and using Tor is bad news bears because mtgox will likely request a positive ID of you to release the funds citing AML requirements.<br /><br />Use Tor to find a Bitcoin laundering service, search our forums to find a reliable one. They will give you an address to send to. Don&#039;t send anything to it just yet (and note that it would take roughly a day for a mix to operate, so don&#039;t panic if it takes time, it&#039;s not instantaneous).<br /><br />Go to instawallet through clearnet and forward the coins to a Bitcoin wallet on your own computer (you need to download some bitcoin wallet software for this, you also need to torify your bitcoin wallet and download the block chain (will take a couple of hours), read this document: http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor). Now it appears that you&#039;ve paid somebody in a different country Bitcoins because your Bitcoin wallet is torified.<br /><br />Ok, now you have an option. For more security, you can use a mix (the bitcoin laundering service I mentioned, it will cost you money), or you go proceed directly to sending bitcoin from your wallet to a new instawallet which you&#039;ve accessed via Tor. Then from instawallet to the SR address you have.<br /><br />I suggest you first do this with a small amount of bitcoin to ensure this all makes sense and then you can be confident enough to do it again. At each stage you should be using a different Bitcoin address, never use the same one twice because that creates a loop, indicating that it is highly likely that any transactions in the loop are authorized by the same person.<br /><br />Yes, you could just link your mtgox a/c to your SR account. But if you read in the newspaper that the Silk Road got busted, then you&#039;re going to feel rather queasy and wish you&#039;d followed the above instructions.<br /><br />If all of this sounds like too much of a headache (albeit it would be hugely educational), then just sell the bitcoins, retrieve your money and start again. If you aren&#039;t confident enough, that would be best.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Condensed Iteration of everything above the line:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Here&#039;s the tldr; version where instructions are separated from advice:<br /><br />Future Activity:<br /><br />Cash deposit at bank to an exchange -&gt; Use Tor to access private proxy* in your country -&gt; communicate through that proxy to the exchange -&gt; convert cash to bitcoins -&gt; open an online wallet service -&gt; send bitcoins to that service -&gt; optionally put those bitcoins through a mix -&gt; send bitcoins to your SR wallet.<br /><br />--<br />If you already have bitcoins connected to your identity. e.g. used a credit card to buy, transferred from your bank account to exchange etc.<br />--<br /><br />Go onto Tor and download bitcoin wallet software -&gt;&nbsp; Printscreen http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor instructions -&gt; Turn off interweb -&gt; Install and torify your bitcoin wallet software -&gt; Turn on interweb and download the block chain to torified bitcoin wallet, now you are ready to proceed -&gt; On clearnet, access your exchange account with the bitcoins -&gt; Make an instawallet/online bitcoin wallet provider account through clearnet -&gt; transfer bitcoins from exchange to instawallet -&gt; transfer from instawallet to your torified bitcoin wallet -&gt; Open new instawallet with Tor -&gt; transfer from torified bitcoin wallet to instawallet on Tor -&gt; Optionally transfer to a bitcoin mixing service -&gt; wait a couple of hours/days -&gt; transfer from mixing service or online wallet to SR.<br /><br />Advice:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t have your clearnet browser and Tor browser open at the same time.<br />2. Never use a Bitcoin address more than once.<br />3. Search forum for bitcoin mixing services and online bitcoin wallet providers.<br />4. If you think you see flaws, you point them out. The only stupid question is one never asked.<br />5. Although the above procedures might make you more paranoid, you should really sleep a whole lot sounder since every service you&#039;ve used from the exchange to the Silk Road itself could be compromised and it wouldn&#039;t matter a whole lot.<br />6. Clearnet means being on the normal web and you&#039;re not using Tor software. Darknet is the opposite.<br />7. To torify something means that its internet traffic is being routed though the Tor network.<br />8. Don&#039;t access exchange websites with Tor, period. Unless you&#039;re doing what I described above<br />9. Don&#039;t access any website with Tor e.g. your instawallet, and then access the same web address/URL using Tor. Now instawallet knows who you are if you do.<br />10. Under no circumstances, none, forward bitcoins from A to B and then put the bitcoins back into a wallet you used earlier. This is circumstantial evidence that all bitcoin activity in that loop belongs to a single entity.<br />11. The larger the quantities being transacted, the more you want to be thinking about ferrying varying amounts of bitcoin over time with different Tor identities. I believe there is bitcoin software that can do this for you, future scheduled deposits that is, and your Tor software periodically changes identity anyway.<br /><br />* It&#039;s like the Home Cooking Channel! Here&#039;s one we made earlier!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks pine!

				<br />Thanks a lot for these facts, as a new member IÂ´m trying to inform about how everything here in our community goes, and what are the terms and rules. So this is very helpful, and I think the 5-transactions-rule without escrow isnÂ´t a risk when you find good vendor(s).<br />And good vendors are possible to find, of course.

				Hi I had a question about Bitinstant...I&#039;m on the cusp of buying bitcoins I&#039;ve finally got the fundamentals down as far as GPG (that was a bitch)&nbsp; and the forum. I found some reputable vendors and am ready to pop my cherry so to speak...I&#039;ve read the Bitinstant Monegram method works anonymously....My question is If I go to walmart, cvs, etc and do the moneygram to bitisnant anonymously no Id fake name etc into my Torified bitcoin wallet and then Transfer to silk road from bitcoin wallet is this safe I mean I&#039;m not tied to the transfer and tor is hiding both the bitwallet and ipaddress its coming from to SR isn&#039;t this safe? Any repsones are helpful thanks Community!!! P.S. I&#039;m not worried about CC cameras or anything My occupation allows me to use multiple walmarts all over the country so I would never use the same one!!!

				Upon further research I think everyone, including myself, are being a little paranoid....The only thing that can be traced are the addresses the bitcoins are being sent too...there is no way to see what was bought....There are legal items on SR so as far as that goes really no danger. The danger comes on the other end when you run the risk of being scammed, package intercepted, or police following package to your home....All these scenarios are easily avoidable just look in the forums there are guides upon guides that will help you utilize SR to is fullest safely and anonymously....SR is a beautiful thing and should be respected don&#039;t come here new on your first day and start making purchases and flooding the forums with questions that have already been covered spend a few days reading through the WIKI and the forums and allow the SR community to guide on your journey to bliss!!!<br />

				So, I&#039;m not sure if this is considered to be related to this topic.... but once you have said anonymous bitcoins in your wallet, what services do most of the big vendors use to then completely anonymously take those bitcoins and turn them into cash. So far I&#039;ve read about turning them into pre-paid visa cards (not sure what a reliable source to do this is). Also, I&#039;ve read that you can sell them on paypal or something like that. But what do I do if I want to anonymously sell bitcoins for cash? and not that counterfit cash nonsense I see on the hiddenwiki.... is there a post for this or a trusted place everyone uses??

				The problem is that most Windows machines are infested with trojans (advanced keyloggers that can capture your keystrokes, record everything you see on your screen, etc). Anybody who used your computer may have also installed spyware to spy on you (i.e. parents, wife, girlfriend, sibling, etc). LE can easily compromise your system remotely and see everything you do on your computer. Nowadays, even Macs and Linux systems are not safe from these trojans. All you really need to do is visit a malicious website (i.e. porn) and you are infected (or insert an infected usb, or install infected software (i.e. pirated software), the new breed of malware is made so that it is&nbsp; undetectable by antivirus programs. Chances are your system is already infested with malware as we speak, logging your keystrokes, recording your screen, and sending the info to them. Virtual boxes/machines won&#039;t help you. <br /><br />The solution is a live USB/CD, whereby even if you get infected by malware, it is gone after you shut down the system as nothing is stored.<br />Hope this answers your question.<br /><br />P.S. - Just a tip: Turn javascript off when using TOR, this will prevent 99.99% of malware from infecting your computer or live USB/CD session.

Just when i plug the LAN cable i am able to connect to the router. But on an older LG notebook, Liberte dont recognize LAN. How this comes?<br />4. There is no chance to use a Bitcoin client with Liberte. I dont feel comfortable to keep my Bitcoins on a online wallet.<br /><br />Could Tails be a better solution for me?

				Hello SR brothers and sisters!<br />First timer here on the road. <br />I have a few questions pertaining to the process of acquiring goods from silk road without being fucked by the long dick of the law.<br /><br />I went to my local library today to use Mt.Gox. I logged on using my library card ID, which is connected to me -_-, to conduct exchanges with mt.gox to instawallet. I then moved the bitcoins to another wallet. <br />I&#039;m assuming it would be unwise to access the wallet on Tor?<br />From what I&#039;ve read of Pine&#039;s post, I should use clearnet to transfer funds from the wallet to a torified bitcoin wallet, etc, before I move the funds to my SR account.<br />Which starts to make me wonder, because what Pine recommends is different from the OP&#039;s method. <br /><br /><br />quoting one of OP&#039;s steps for his method:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2. Moving Bitcoins<br /><br />By the time you get home (or back to the library), you&#039;ll get an e-mail with a Mt Gox redeemable code for your bitcoins. Again make sure you access Mt <br />Gox from a computer not in any way connected to you. At this point you should send the funds through a couple of instawallets. ABSOLUTELY MAKE <br />SURE YOU BOOKMARK THE INSTAWALLET ADDRESSES!!! EVEN WRITE THEM DOWN!!! You can also put the coins through a tumbling service like BitcoinFog, but I don&#039;t find it necessary. The fact that the coins can&#039;t be linked to you in the first place is what really matters. Whenever you&#039;re happy with the degree<br />to which your coins have been obscured, transfer your funds into your Silk Road wallet.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />what do you mean, when he says that the coins can&#039;t be linked to me is what really matters? does the exchange between mtgox and instawallets anonymize the transactions? let&#039;s say i use instawallet and move funds from one wallet to another on clearnet. and then i use tor to access that wallet so i can move the funds to SR. wouldn&#039;t LE find it odd that the funds were being transferred from one wallet to another in one fixed location in the US, and then tor comes in, and all of a sudden the wallet&#039;s being accessed from lets say, tokyo?<br />err, i don&#039;t know if i&#039;m making too much sense with all this.<br />i&#039;m probably coming off as uber paranoid, but i kinda freaked out after i read that article on that couple getting arrested for 50 tabs of LSD. <br />it doesn&#039;t help that I live in a really small town next to NYC with fucking black hawk helicopters flying around every 20 minutes. man these guys are draconian as fuck.<br />help would be greatly appreciated &lt;3

				Perhaps a stupid question, but I am only moderately computer savvy. What security or anonymity issues does booting from a liberte enabled usb drive circumvent, that the tor browser does not already? I can&#039;t imagine that there is much of a trace being left on your hard drive when visiting SR from the tor browser. Or am I way off?

				Isn&#039;t it a bit erroneous to have everybody on typical software? Sounds like a great vector to start a hack from since the member base will end up homogenized.<br /><br />I want to ask about deep packet inspection and TOR nodes on the net. Let&#039;s say DPI is being deployed against us specifically on border routers. The first 1000 bytes are fingerprinted in the encryption payload in the US and for some crappy reason the entrance and exit from the TOR network stayed in the US. Problem? Due to the fact that the user&#039;s asynchronous keys do not change what stops the entrance and exit DPI fingerprinting, nothing, IMHO. (Within the US or within any other countries domain. There are language differences which weaken TOR due to clustering.) My next question regards the internal TOR network. I assume that these TOR nodes are wildly divergent machines with very different capabilities hardware-wise. I was thinking about any leverage which could be gained from a TOR entrance node that was powerful enough to engage in DPI. In the event that the feds have placed TOR nodes in the network that are powerful enough for DPI inspection within the network could this allow for escalation to other areas within the network? Is there an internal re-wrapping mechanism that would thwart DPI within the network itself? And if so what really secures the asynchronous keys from machine to machine in relation? At this time, seeing that DPI is not overt due to legal issues, could a mapping process already be underway that could be used against our infrastructure in the future? The NSA made some pretty impressive build-outs in the last few years.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there is some type of federal presence here already. I&#039;m not uber paranoid. I just know the turf well. If there is any relevance in what I&#039;ve written here to you and you have questions or comments that are sensitive, PM me. I may be missing something that I should be aware of and need to be schooled. I have a few thoughts on encryption and it&#039;s relevancy. Due to the sensitive nature of this site why bother to decrypt the messages anyway? Just trace out the network and the users and there will be all kinds of end user holes and opportunity for physical investigation, starting with surveillance if the DPI can really leverage that over time. Defenders have to defend everything they have all the time, attackers have all the time in the world and they only need one hole. PGP was broken BTW....<br /><br />Has anybody read about Jeremy Hammond? He got busted awhile back for popping Stratfor Intel. Read up on how he got it, pretty simple shit really, wet-ware gets fucked up easily, and exits the mouth or keyboard. Once the feds trace you down they sit on you and monitor your uptime and relative nics in chats, forums, SILK ROAD, and etc. They record when you login, logout, when you leave your home, enter your home. Couple this with an informant that you think you can trust. BUSTED!!!! This happened within the anonymous network and trust me that the SR user base is nowhere near as cryptic as these folks. On the other hand, SR&#039;s majority is just a bunch of dope really, nothing like Jeremy, he ripped Strafor&#039;s user base off for $700,000 and then because of that they got hit with a $1.26 million dollar lawsuit. I think they are still pissed and putting their fucked up little palace back together. That&#039;s why the feds took the time on him. I read a post from a member that said that he was excited about SR &amp; these are &quot;interesting times&quot;. That was a mouthful!<br /><br />I have read this whole thread. There are about 6 folks who have decent encryption knowledge here. Trust is a very fickle thing. I seen quite a few threads asking for liberte wifi drivers....and I&#039;ll bet they&#039;re out there downloading all kinds of shit to there super-secret liberte dongle, hehehehe. Ala instant website with a great driver, including a nice hash of the binary with my malware already in it and they won&#039;t cross-check this shit against other sources anyway so I&#039;ll nail a lot of you. That&#039;s a theoretical black hat thinking who would love to rip off your bitcoins or a fed who would like to cool your heels for awhile.<br /><br />I&#039;m keeping my eye on this community to see what develops. That is my interest. Drugs are all over I don&#039;t see the need to expose ones self to this; especially if you&#039;re in the forums crying &quot;NEWB!!!!!&quot; iyiyi, the internet is SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS folks, trust me on this. Somehow you still need to receive whatever you&#039;re after so in the end there are physical connections and data collections out there with your fingerprint on them. The &quot;Return to Sender&quot; thing is hilarious but as a last ditch hail mary it&#039;s cool for the lawyers to play with. I think you&#039;re better off finding a few local drug dealers and keeping this shit to the sneakernet. I cannot think of anyway better than a good darkweb remailer for SOME protection; he/she can still get the screws put to them though; make cross-validated bust detectors with an email triad. (at least?) each remailer keep a laptop in an encrypted private VPN that does nothing but run cron jobs minutely detecting the presence of the others. If the door gets knocked down the laptop lid gets slammed shut to a power off mode, down go the cron jobs, the remailer triad immediately folds and all data is flushed magnetically on the other two. Cron runs a BASH script that fires up an electromagnet on the data drive in question wherever it may be. You&#039;ll need to understand some engineering and Arduinos for this type of tech-foo. The more the merrier but the cost will rise with each remailer used. The remailers will still be holding all of this shit and I would feel bad for them. If trusted computing comes to the net this is all over anyway, we&#039;ll be fucked in the long run. The facial recognition software is amazing shit too; another piece of very useful data for the savvy investigator. So before you walk in the bank put on a ski mask, lol.<br /><br />1nz74g8

				This is a very old article on Wired that is still relevant. It sums up the state of things very nicely.<br /><br />http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/09/security_matters_0920?currentPage=all<br /><br />I looked around some more and went over the TOR pages for the umpteenth time in almost as many years. I looked at the Wired article again and I still concur. The technology of the web has not stopped its light speed advance concerning the breaking of online anonymity. In fact, since I have other written works on the web under different identities, there is a project that can heuristically match my writing style up to a 95% accuracy. That is my &quot;fist&quot; in sigint speak. There is a trove of other shit out there. If you do not dedicate the most part of your waking hours reading IT material you are not up on things and can be tricked very easily.<br /><br />I think true anonymity, serious hacking really, is actually quite brutal.<br /><br />I will now tell a you a scenario that I call &quot;Ghetto Hacking&quot;.<br /><br />You find people in an area of interest that are vulnerable. This may be a vulnerability that takes many forms. Bums, drug dealers, whores, pedophiles, the gullible, and the just plain retarded. You handle yourself and others with kid gloves; you just dropped in too, are needy and irrelevant, but hey, I have some cash! Pick your mark carefully, MDMA, excessive vodka consumption, whatever, just stay away from crackheads, set up house-keeping, let things cool down and bring in your equipment. The way you procured your hardware is important. It must be untraceable. You are using people who are not good witnesses as defined by law. Your mark rented a place with a garage, right? Watch the physical security. If this doesn&#039;t flow out get lost, especially if you just stuck your .45 in someones face because of some unforeseen problem that developed.<br /><br />We have our human proxies and they are totally disposable. (The level of which depends on how much of a bastard you are.) If you are a total bastard your operation is very deep, has a lot of cash or serious benefactors, and it is clear to you that if you fuck up you get planted. You run your hacks, do your business. Get into a serious dealer for intel. In Chicago, and other major cities, they have kids running around the neighborhood with pagers; if you look out of place, someone hears about it. You can watch your mail drops like this if you need them. The cops and feds really hate getting shot and the south side is a fucking meat-grinder. Your lab is outfitted with thermite and/or electromagnetic wiping on the encrypted drives. I destroyed them, fuck you, here is the password, sorry about that grenade in the case.<br /><br />The job can be in and out; your going to take down some credit cards off a server and sell the files to seattle cc punks. Get the bum to set up internet, do your business and split. If you need more time, you can distribute your access through wireless nodes around your location. If you need low profile high bandwidth, consider your needs and multiplex the APs accordingly. If you need more bust-time. consider spreading this by linking with laser or microwave LOS connections to aggregated AP nodes with your kids watching just in case. This is done black bag or on a loosely associated set of greased hands. I would suggest befriending anarchist collectives. I would not leave any equipment behind. Good assassins wear gloves and drop a clean gun right on the marks chest and split. Your keyboard, case and peripherals are most likely filled with DNA, as is the room/house/apt that you were in. You deal with it, bleach and sulpher are your friends. At the extreme, burn the equipment thoroughly off-site after wiping, crush it, mix it into a batch of concrete and drop that block into the ocean. Really good hackers are never detected for the most part. Depending on the level you want to operate at you may need to get down like this.<br /><br />I believe that ALL data that crosses the internet in ANY way can be reconstituted at this time. The level of the infraction in relation to the cost of the operations for blackhats and the corresponding writehats is constantly weighed and adjusted accordingly. Once seriously burned the feds file the fist and watch for it actively in routers, switches, and server honeypots. 0 day is NOT a rain ticket. I have had it and I will attest to the fact that usually these things are patched very quickly, thus WATCHED. I did not come here to scare everybody away from using sr. I just beleive in the hard, honest truth about the internet. Someone mentioned a couple that got popped with fifty hits of lsd in a post on this site. Do you folks realize how totally serious-fucking-OMG-I&#039;m-fucked charges those are!? THEY ARE FUCKED HARD. I&#039;m completely positive that it utterly destroyed their lives. Use whatever savvy you have to social engineer the living shit out of your physical delivery mechanism. I think this is the most crucial step in dealing on sr. This takes into account that you have the electronic part nailed down really well. Furthermore, the sloppier you are electronically, the closer they could potentially get to you and the seller. Find your level of bastard and stick to it or in the long run, this is not for you IMHO. I stated some problems about DPI in the last post. As far as I know, in and out node connections are in the clear on TOR. Even if they were encrypted the keys would not change either.&nbsp; Sooo........in the event that the in and out nodes were under the control of a combined DPI comb the hash would be traced. This means a full end to end tie through TOR with timestamps and encryption sigs existing on the clearweb routers. If your good enough to go look at them go ahead but don&#039;t forget about network taps slick.<br /><br />Ok, I&#039;m getting sick of this topic now but I decided to be helpful when I got up. I need to finish this with a few final comments. It may be prudent to poll the site for people who got popped and try to tie the shit back to the court records; start pulling the court transcripts; key evidence files under open records. Some people are howling and I&#039;m sure some of these cases can be sniffed out for study based on weighed coincidence. (SR mentioned maybe....) The final proof will be in the transcripts of the case. It will take time; I&#039;m not up for it. Someone else may care. I don&#039;t really. The whole gig draws skills from more than just fiddling with computers. You&#039;re going to need more than that to even get close to bulletproof. The actual definition for intelligence relates directly to your knowledge of the environment; not the little fantasy environment you may be having in windoze. Go out and look at every possible avenue available to you, plan according to your needs, and your level of experience. This dude that started this thread is cool doing this but I think it comes off as so defacto when there are many different avenues to approach this with. Give a man a fish you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and he is fed for a lifetime. Final thought. Some may think I&#039;m a bit daft outing this really serious hacker post. Not really. I&#039;m not a thief, nor do I put myself in compromising situations. I don&#039;t have to send drugs through the mail. If I want them I have people who can bring them to me, usually in a few minutes. Have fun, get advice, make advice, and don&#039;t forget to sometimes take advice.<br /><br />1nz74g8<br /><br /><br />

				Oh my, do be careful....<br /><br />Anyhow, the &quot;root&quot; of any drive is basically the first thing that you would see when clicking on any typical drive from your windoze exploder. All of the folders/files in this first area are &quot;at the root of the drive&quot;. In DOS it is denoted (usually) as &quot;C://&quot; in a command prompt. (dir and cd will work in DOS but not ls, BTW, read on...) In Linux this is denoted as &quot;/&quot; (forget quotes, get used to BASH &amp; DOS if you want to get into this deeper.) You would find this in terminal. Beware though that you will most likely start terminal from the root users home directory &quot;~&quot;. a &quot;cd /&quot; will put you at the root of the terminal&#039;s focus. To go back to the root users home directory &quot;cd ~&quot;, to step back &quot;cd ..&quot;. The &quot;dir&quot; &amp; &quot;ls&quot; commands will help you see what is in the different directories. Things may also be hidden using basic convention such as &quot;./&quot; and can be seen by attempting to cd into &quot;./&quot; or using &quot;ls -a&quot;. Google is your friend dude, seriously, use that before posting. This is really really simple first steps kinda stuff.....<br /><br />1nz74g8

It sums up the state of things very nicely.<br /><br />http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/09/security_matters_0920?currentPage=all<br /><br />I looked around some more and went over the TOR pages for the umpteenth time in almost as many years. I looked at the Wired article again and I still concur. The technology of the web has not stopped its light speed advance concerning the breaking of online anonymity. In fact, since I have other written works on the web under different identities, there is a project that can heuristically match my writing style up to a 95% accuracy. That is my &quot;fist&quot; in sigint speak. There is a trove of other shit out there. If you do not dedicate the most part of your waking hours reading IT material you are not up on things and can be tricked very easily.<br /><br />I think true anonymity, serious hacking really, is actually quite brutal.<br /><br />I will now tell a you a scenario that I call &quot;Ghetto Hacking&quot;.<br /><br />You find people in an area of interest that are vulnerable. This may be a vulnerability that takes many forms. Bums, drug dealers, whores, pedophiles, the gullible, and the just plain retarded. You handle yourself and others with kid gloves; you just dropped in too, are needy and irrelevant, but hey, I have some cash! Pick your mark carefully, MDMA, excessive vodka consumption, whatever, just stay away from crackheads, set up house-keeping, let things cool down and bring in your equipment. The way you procured your hardware is important. It must be untraceable. You are using people who are not good witnesses as defined by law. Your mark rented a place with a garage, right? Watch the physical security. If this doesn&#039;t flow out get lost, especially if you just stuck your .45 in someones face because of some unforeseen problem that developed.<br /><br />We have our human proxies and they are totally disposable. (The level of which depends on how much of a bastard you are.) If you are a total bastard your operation is very deep, has a lot of cash or serious benefactors, and it is clear to you that if you fuck up you get planted. You run your hacks, do your business. Get into a serious dealer for intel. In Chicago, and other major cities, they have kids running around the neighborhood with pagers; if you look out of place, someone hears about it. You can watch your mail drops like this if you need them. The cops and feds really hate getting shot and the south side is a fucking meat-grinder. Your lab is outfitted with thermite and/or electromagnetic wiping on the encrypted drives. I destroyed them, fuck you, here is the password, sorry about that grenade in the case.<br /><br />The job can be in and out; your going to take down some credit cards off a server and sell the files to seattle cc punks. Get the bum to set up internet, do your business and split. If you need more time, you can distribute your access through wireless nodes around your location. If you need low profile high bandwidth, consider your needs and multiplex the APs accordingly. If you need more bust-time. consider spreading this by linking with laser or microwave LOS connections to aggregated AP nodes with your kids watching just in case. This is done black bag or on a loosely associated set of greased hands. I would suggest befriending anarchist collectives. I would not leave any equipment behind. Good assassins wear gloves and drop a clean gun right on the marks chest and split. Your keyboard, case and peripherals are most likely filled with DNA, as is the room/house/apt that you were in. You deal with it, bleach and sulpher are your friends. At the extreme, burn the equipment thoroughly off-site after wiping, crush it, mix it into a batch of concrete and drop that block into the ocean. Really good hackers are never detected for the most part. Depending on the level you want to operate at you may need to get down like this.<br /><br />I believe that ALL data that crosses the internet in ANY way can be reconstituted at this time. The level of the infraction in relation to the cost of the operations for blackhats and the corresponding writehats is constantly weighed and adjusted accordingly. Once seriously burned the feds file the fist and watch for it actively in routers, switches, and server honeypots. 0 day is NOT a rain ticket. I have had it and I will attest to the fact that usually these things are patched very quickly, thus WATCHED. I did not come here to scare everybody away from using sr. I just beleive in the hard, honest truth about the internet. Someone mentioned a couple that got popped with fifty hits of lsd in a post on this site. Do you folks realize how totally serious-fucking-OMG-I&#039;m-fucked charges those are!? THEY ARE FUCKED HARD. I&#039;m completely positive that it utterly destroyed their lives. Use whatever savvy you have to social engineer the living shit out of your physical delivery mechanism. I think this is the most crucial step in dealing on sr. This takes into account that you have the electronic part nailed down really well. Furthermore, the sloppier you are electronically, the closer they could potentially get to you and the seller. Find your level of bastard and stick to it or in the long run, this is not for you IMHO. I stated some problems about DPI in the last post. As far as I know, in and out node connections are in the clear on TOR. Even if they were encrypted the keys would not change either.&nbsp; Sooo........in the event that the in and out nodes were under the control of a combined DPI comb the hash would be traced. This means a full end to end tie through TOR with timestamps and encryption sigs existing on the clearweb routers. If your good enough to go look at them go ahead but don&#039;t forget about network taps slick.<br /><br />Ok, I&#039;m getting sick of this topic now but I decided to be helpful when I got up. I need to finish this with a few final comments. It may be prudent to poll the site for people who got popped and try to tie the shit back to the court records; start pulling the court transcripts; key evidence files under open records. Some people are howling and I&#039;m sure some of these cases can be sniffed out for study based on weighed coincidence. (SR mentioned maybe....) The final proof will be in the transcripts of the case. It will take time; I&#039;m not up for it. Someone else may care. I don&#039;t really. The whole gig draws skills from more than just fiddling with computers. You&#039;re going to need more than that to even get close to bulletproof. The actual definition for intelligence relates directly to your knowledge of the environment; not the little fantasy environment you may be having in windoze. Go out and look at every possible avenue available to you, plan according to your needs, and your level of experience. This dude that started this thread is cool doing this but I think it comes off as so defacto when there are many different avenues to approach this with. Give a man a fish you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and he is fed for a lifetime. Final thought. Some may think I&#039;m a bit daft outing this really serious hacker post. Not really. I&#039;m not a thief, nor do I put myself in compromising situations. I don&#039;t have to send drugs through the mail. If I want them I have people who can bring them to me, usually in a few minutes. Have fun, get advice, make advice, and don&#039;t forget to sometimes take advice.<br /><br />1nz74g8<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As far as the handwritieng thing goes.... we combat that (hopefully) by having multiple people type, and then also people type when shitty drunk, stoned, benzo&#039;d etc to get the general point across but still remain anonymous. if they figure it out, id be surpriced. hahae

				Thanks for the tips!! <br />One question, sometimes I get really bored at work especially my late shift. What&#039;s the best way to surf anonymously, and how would you do it?<br /><br />My choices are<br />1. Use 2nd machine Liberte USB boot wi-fi connection to my iphone tethering. (not connected to work netowork) <br />2. Use my main primary corporate machine with VM or Virtualbox Ubuntu install (Tor connection via work network)<br />3. Use my main primary corporate machine with VM or Virtualbox Ubuntu install (usb wi-fi and Tor connection via iphone tethering)<br /><br />The corporate laptop is Win7 with corporate image.<br />- Symantec Endpoint (always updated)<br />- VPN connection to file servers. <br /><br />I am sure IT guys have monitor the network usage and keep logs for security reasons, but I was hoping to surf the web anonymously using just my primary machine. Any tips? <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been a member and basically window shopped and searched around, and I finally found this. but i&#039;m confused a bit.. What exactly is liberte and why is it necessary? Is it just to have a secure flashdrive? I currently just have the Tor Browser Bundle installed on an external hardrive. How inadequate/dangerous is this? <br /><br />I don&#039;t plan on doing any vending whatsoever, but I do plan on making some decent molly purchases along with some other things...

				Quick questions<br />Should I use a tormail for both the mt gox and bitinstant accounts? I ask this because I read that tormail can only be accessed through tor and im not sure if i can use tor at my local library.<br /><br />Is it safe to use all accounts (emails, mt gox, bitinstant) for multiple transactions at different times or should i create new accounts each time i purchase bitcoins?<br /><br />Also thank you for all the helpful step-by-step. I now only access silk road and anything related to it via my USB. Before i was just using Tor on my browser, so do i need to wipe my computer of any past silk road history? If so, is there anything i have to do other than a basic history wipe? I have not made any transactions yet, just visited silk road and the forums.<br />

				I am very thankful for this thread, thank you very many mr. Keats :)<br /><br />I understand that now that I have a (almost, more on that later) working Liberte on a USB, I&#039;m pretty much all set to use SR with reasonable security? After a total cleanup of my comps and backups, I will not have any trace whatsoever of me visiting the shady parts of the interwebz, right? All I have is this USB drive that I just found laying on the street and picked it up, which is encrypted and doesnt even appear to have any content in it when you first take a look? <br /><br />So when the LE comes through my door (this is the scenario I think everyone should be preparing themselves to), my house is clean, my comps are clean, everything is clean - except for the parcel someone sent me that I know nothing about.<br /><br />Right?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.msg722016#msg722016">Quote from: Waterloo on January 12, 2013, 04:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can all these steps be made through a Mac computer? It&#039;s all I have at hand, I really need to get myself a windows.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I did this with a Mac.<br /><br />I downloaded the trial version of Parallels for Mac and set it up with an old copy of XP that I happened to have (I think these are readily available from the torrent site of your choice). I then dragged the Liberte.zip to the XP desktop. Next I formatted (FAT32) my USB key with XP, and exctracted the .zip to my newly formatted USB drive. &quot;Liberte&quot; -folder has to be at root level. Locate and run &quot;setup.bat&quot;, read the onscreen info, this takes a minute. You&#039;re done! Shut down the comp, and power it back on holding the &quot;alt&quot; -key.<br /><br />(After creating the USB you can get rid of XP and Parallels if you wish. I did, I have no use for them anymore.)<br /><br />I had previously installed rEFIt, to help boot from the USB (didnt work initially as I tried to make a bootable usb on OSX), and I was able to boot from Liberte. I then tried to remove rEFIt, and guess what?? It still worked, straight from the normal Mac boot chooser. Yeah!<br /><br />Only problem I now have is my wifi, which is not working in Liberte. The wireless card is recognized, and it finds all the networks near me, but cannot connect to any of them. Bummer! The Internet is working through ethernet, I presume (as read from many many forums; I haven&#039;t tried it yet, I haven&#039;t got an ethernet port in my MBAir), so if you&#039;re using a desktop mac this might not be a problem for you at all.<br /><br />I would be very happy if someone would be able to help me with the WiFi problem. I found a solution from the Liberte forums (CLEARNET WARNING!! https://forum.dee.su/topic/connection-problem), but it has its drawbacks: with this, the MAC Address could not be masked. And I think that my real MAC is probably a wise thing to hide is it not?<br /><br />Any help on this one would be very much appreciated! In the meantime, I&#039;m gonna go get me an el-cheapo -USB-wifi -dongle somewhere and hope that works better.

On shut down the system wipes your ram and leaves no trace of activity.<br /><br />The Amnesic Incognito Live System - Tails, is one of those systems that runs fine on a Macbook.<br /><br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Download the current version @ https://tails.boum.org/<br /><br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burn the ISO image onto a DVD<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert blank DVD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open &quot;Disk Utility&quot; (OSX feature)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the &quot;File&quot; Menu click on &quot;Open Disk Image...&quot; and choose the Tails ISO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ISO will now appear in the lower part of the left column<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Select the image there and click on the atomic &quot;Burn&quot; icon in the top left corner and burn to the DVD with slow speed (2x/4x)<br /><br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you restart your Macbook with the DVD inserted wait for the screen to get white and immediately press and hold the alt button until you reach the bootloader. Navigate to the DVD entry labeled &quot;Windows&quot; and press enter.<br /><br /><br />VoilÃ¡! You are now ready to go. Network drivers, Touchpad, etc. all supported by default.<br /><br />You also have the option to insert a Thumbdrive and clone the system to it via&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applications - System Tools - Tails USB Installer<br />This will give you the option to create a persistent Volume (e.g. save files, pgp keys) and will work much faster than a DVD.<br />Although booting from a USB drive is not possible with the default apple bootloader you can download and install rEFIt from you OSX, which will recognize the drive.<br />rEFIt: http://refit.sourceforge.net/<br /><br /><br />hope that helped :)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />peace<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i read something like people should not use tails, did i misread or is this method ok

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />A newbie here, working up to my first purchase on SR and trying to make sure I do it right. So the guide looks fantastic but I have a couple of quick questions.<br /><br />1. This guide is over a year old now. Is it all still pertinent information for the new guys or are there any parts of it I need to do differently.<br /><br />2. Bearing in mind I&#039;ll only be buying small amounts of class B or Cs (I&#039;m in the UK), is having the package sent to someone else&#039;s address really necessary? It seems to me that I&#039;d just be transferring the risks involved to the other person and that seems like a kinda shitty thing to do.<br /><br />Thanks guys, any help will be greatly appreciated.

I used my home address because i dont have a second address like you, and i dont want to get my friends involved in this just like you! <br />Before placing and order just make sure that there are no other drugs / drug accessories (bong and the like) at your place! And if the package arrives enjoy it until your next order ;) i think this method is as safe as ordering to another address!

It&#039;ll give you a nice starting place. I wanted to add that I had problems using Liberte&#039; and it seemed to be in the program itself. It wouldn&#039;t allow me to access file manager after I had copied files from my hard drive to paste elsewhere and you are forced to log off and back on for it to work each time. Might not be with everyone but it was a problem with me. Good Luck.
