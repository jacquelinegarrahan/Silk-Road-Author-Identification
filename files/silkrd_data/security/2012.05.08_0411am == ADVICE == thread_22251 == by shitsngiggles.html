				Stop talking like your in school or a group therapy session led by trained leaders.. <br /><br />Hear me out.. or not.. not a big deal, give me negative karma or whatever for all I care.. but here is how LEO takes places down. Intelligence. Not just intelligence, but intelligence gathering and all that implies in that subject. This forum.... its a gold mine for knowledge and info on where people are from, shipping methods, traffic information, etc. There are obvious reasons and perks for a forum for such a fantastic sight, but some of you seriously need to watch what you say and how you act online as an &#039;anonymous&#039; entity.. I&#039;ve seen (figuratively) people get mailed substances and ask the forum aloud what it is, what it looks like, and what it was sent in.. Ive seen people use the same usernames in multiple online address&#039;s. <br /><br />This is a freedom, but that doesn&#039;t mean to exercise every freedom possible. You will lose this freedom. <br />I speak with kind words<br /><br />-SnG

				I hear you, but what prevents any officer from getting this information (packaging, shipping, etc) by ordering the products? All they need is a few bitcoins and an account on SR. Hiding this information on the forums doesn&#039;t really do any good to legitimate users.<br /><br />I just hope these two things happen every time: 1) vendor treats every buyer as a potential LEO, and 2) buyer treats every vendor as a potential LEO. The only person(s) that have both buyer and vendor info is the SR admins.

Other than scouring for clues as to identities/locations of vendors, LE probably gets its jollies on here by trolling and intimidating our community.<br /><br />That being said, I echo your sentiment. At the very least, people should pick monikers completely unrelated to themselves (other online identities, IRL nicknames, etc.) when coming here. I think it&#039;s part of the fun, really. I see the same usernames everywhere I go in my online ventures, but when I come here, I see this unique one. A constant reminder that this place should be at least a little unfamiliar and unsettling at all times.

				Nice post. To add my 2 cents, a lot of crime solving is pattern recognition. Keep your mouths shut (in the forum and irl) and don&#039;t stick to a set pattern. Change up the size of your labels, the fonts you use, where you drop, where you buy postage, and for sucks sake QUIT TALKING SPECIFICS IN THE FORUMS. Buyers, change up the addresses where you receive when you can.

				I&#039;ve not made a secret of the fact I&#039;m British (one of 70 million people) or indeed I work in the Finance sector (around 5 million people in total) - and any fool knows a Police officer could have an account on one of these forums. I think it&#039;s safe to say we have got the message!<br /><br />V.
