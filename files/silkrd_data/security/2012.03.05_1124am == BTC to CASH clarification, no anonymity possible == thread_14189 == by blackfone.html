				I&#039;ve been reading this forum for literally almost 10 hours straight. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that total anonymity is not possible. The last possible stage in the seller&#039;s process is the worst at anonymity.<br /><br />Things that protect sellers/buyers:<br />-Anonymous mail with PGP<br />-Running Liberte Live USB to cover tracks<br />-Using TOR<br /><br />Which I&#039;m comfortable with, but the part where you sell your Liberty Reserve is where things get sticky. EVERY SINGLE exchange wants identifiable information, usually PHOTO ID, BANK STATEMENT, even proof of residence (some)<br /><br />I was a little excited when I saw wm-center, because it seemed I could just send the CASH to WU. Half way through the order they ask for the receiver&#039;s name and BANK. Again. The fucking bank is going to ask for IDENTIFICATION.<br /><br />Anonymity is achieved until this point.<br /><br />Help me out here because I&#039;ve only come to two conclusions. You take the risk with your own name being on an account that possibly THOUSANDS of dollars are going to be withdrawn, which isn&#039;t directly connected to the IRS or the law, but if the bank gets a subpoena and checks your account. There is an obvious paper trail.<br /><br />Either Sellers are opening accounts with FAKE credentials, which carries obvious legal concerns or they are taking the risk that all of the rest of the security measures are going to protect them.<br /><br />This is the only part of the process I&#039;m not clear on. Where is the anonymity.<br /><br />I have looked all over the forum, through this disorganized mess of shit...and it is a lot of shit. I have yet to see anyone address this issue.&nbsp; I really wish someone would help me with these concerns, I want to be a part of SR but want to make sure I&#039;ve done everything possible. It seems like such a fucking waste put all this technology to such a good use and then give your government issued slave papers to the establishment with a direct line to you.<br /><br />It&#039;s looking more and more like people are using fakes. I mean wouldn&#039;t you? That&#039;s the complete package. I&#039;m not condoning or saying I would.<br /><br />Perfect Scenario:<br />-Live USB boot <br />-coffee shop/access point<br />-tor everything<br />-head down the street to the ATM<br />-Billy Bob get&#039;s his account frozen by whomever, authorities begin investigation on Billy Bob<br />-SR Seller takes a Quaalude and grabs another identity<br /><br />At the end of the year if you have accumulated enough unclaimed income, I think this could bite me or whomever in the ass. However, people must be getting away with it. How paranoid to I need to be, if I&#039;m paranoid to the max then I make no money. If I&#039;m not I could really hurt myself, this last and final step seems crucially important.<br /><br />I really hope my post doesn&#039;t get ignored like so many others. If ANYONE thinks all of this has been addressed, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE link me so I can go read it or set me straight on what I&#039;m missing. Right now this just seems impractical/unsafe.<br />&nbsp;

				Hi blackfone,<br /><br />Not to be rude but do you really expect the sellers to reveal intricate details of their cash management procedures on a public forum?<br /><br />Trust me, there are ways to safe and secure in cashing out your hard earned BTC and we have done so successfully for 6 months and there are many other vendors out there too.<br /><br />We would never risk our identity in the process, so it can be done - you just have to think outside the box!<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />Matrix&nbsp; 8)

				Thanks bro, I guess that was the nudge I was looking for, I&#039;ll go ahead and delete this thread so as not to clutter up the place too much. I need more NERD friends seriously.<br /><br />Guess I&#039;ll see you outside the lines. Back to the thinkin&#039; Box.

				@blackfone<br /><br />There are a couple of things you mention that are wrong or not entirely true:<br /><br />&gt;EVERY SINGLE exchange wants identifiable information, usually PHOTO ID, BANK STATEMENT, even proof of residence (some)<br /><br />Not true. Many exchanges do not. It is funny how you mention in the next line wm-center, which does not need any identification information. There are tons of other ones that do not require info as well.<br /><br />And even if they do require info, they want digital copies of scanned documents, and they do not check to make sure those documents are real. Hire someone for $50 to photoshop papers for you if it is an absolute.<br /><br />&gt;Half way through the order they ask for the receiver&#039;s name and BANK. Again. The fucking bank is going to ask for IDENTIFICATION.<br /><br />You&#039;re doing it wrong. Get physical cash and then physically go into a Western Union. From there you can put in the exchanger info and if you&#039;re sending less than $1000 then they do not ask for ID, or at least here in the US. This way no documents and no paper trail is recorded.<br /><br /><br />Also, I haven&#039;t tried it or looked into it, but isn&#039;t there MOM services here where you can mail them cash in the mail and for like 10% (which is better than WU -&gt; wm-center -&gt; btc) will convert it to btc anon for you?
