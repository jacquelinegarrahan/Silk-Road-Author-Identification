				I have a bit of btc tied up with SR now and obviously cannot access as the site is down. Werent all funds supposed to be transferred to the wallet I set up if the site went down? I hope all is well and all gets back up and running, but I would have hoped this disbursement feature would have worked so I would have access to my $. Any ideas how this works? Is there a certain amount of time of SR being down before the coins get transferred to my wallet? Thanks!

				If SR needed to be shut down for good your BTC would then be transferred to the address you provided.<br /><br />Though this is not good...it will be up by Monday and that would put SR down for total of about 3 days. <br /><br /><br />Your btc will be in your account just as it was before SR went down for this period.<br /><br />I hope that answers your question as this thread is now locked.
