				Title: <strong>Questions about SR bitcoin address</strong><br />

				Hey guys, pretty new, been lurking a little for last 2 weeks and i&#039;ve been reviewing as much security information as I can however I haven&#039;t seemed to come across information about your SR bitcoin (wallet?) address. The main information i&#039;m after is 1. If I was to change my SR bitcoin address would my balance be wiped? Do i have to transfer coins to another wallet or something before i change my address to keep the remaining bitcoins?<br /><br />Also in terms of security if i was to change my SR address, on the bitcoin network do they keep any logs or anything of that sort on previous addresses ? Or does anyone for that matter? Just wondering what&#039;s to stop people changing their SR address and then it doesn&#039;t really matter if your bitcoin path (from a bitcoin seller to your account) is more direct? so long as it&#039;s anonymous anyways = even more anonymity? <br /><br />SOrry if i&#039;m a bit over the place lol. thanks

				No, you won&#039;t lose the coins in your account when you change the address. It&#039;s basically just a way to create a new unique account number for your SR wallet. <br /><br />I like to change my address both before AND after any transfers. This way, the location that the coins went to or came from no longer exists and as such can&#039;t be located by the blockchain.<br /><br />Just make sure that any Bitcoin transfers in or out are confirmed and complete before you change the address. If not, that is how you might lose coins that were in transit at the time of the change.

				Thanks for that, that&#039;s what I wanted to know, wish I could give ya some karma. As long as the address is untraceable once you release it that&#039;s perfect. If anyone knows otherwise please reply :)

				But I&#039;ve also heard that once you replace your address sometimes that it can be reassigned to another person? is this true? If so wouldn&#039;t the incriminating data lead to that person? or is there still logs on which addresses you previously owned/time stamps of change?

That&#039;s just a scenario I came up with, I don&#039;t know of any better ways they can get to you. Learn the basics of bitcoins so you can make your own scenarios&nbsp; ;D
