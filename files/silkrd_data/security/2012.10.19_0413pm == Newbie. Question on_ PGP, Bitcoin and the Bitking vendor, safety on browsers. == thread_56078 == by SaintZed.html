				Hi, I&#039;m Zed!!!!<br /><br />I was wondering if it was safe to download all of my pgp encrypter on my regular browser or should i always be installing things off the tor browser when it has to do with SR stuff. Do i make myself an email account attached to the tor browser as well? I understand i should learn bit coin knowledge, but can i just work out a deal with the bitking vendor and is that commonly feasible on the SR? <br />Safely, can i use both browsers at one time and not be in danger? i.e. can i check my hotmail account on my firefox broswer while switching between windows to my tor browser to shop on the SR? or should i just leave one thing shut down while operating the other?<br /><br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to help me out, i cant wait to make a good rep on here for myself.&nbsp; :)

				seriously? if you want a good rep spend some time reading the forums<br /><br />there is a freaking thread called &quot;using tor and another web browser&quot; on the SECOND page of this category... <br /><br />since you obviously havent spent much time and effort trying to figure it out yourself, good luck here

				Is it just me or are other people noticing a huge influx of new members who, to be frank, are lazy and impatient! There&#039;s new threads every day asking questions that have been answered again and again. For God&#039;s sake, this is not a place where you join up and place an order in the space of 10 minutes. There is a lot to get your head around for new members, but rushing into things without having the knowledge to place an order, buy bitcoins or most importantly, use SR safely and securely is potentially dangerous. Knowledge is power, and the more you read about how things work and the processes you should follow to stay safe, the more comfortable you&#039;ll feel with everything. Knowing you&#039;ve done all you can to protect your anonymity will give you some piece of mind. Rushing in and not doing some of your own research will only lead to mistakes being made that could change your life forever. Never get complacent, always use the SR Escrow system when making a purchase and visit this forum as often as possible. :)

				i totally agree, to be honest its pretty fucking annoying. i remember when i first joined over a year ago i spent literally days reading everything i possibly could... found everything i needed to know on the forums already without asking lazy adolescent mental capability questions<br /><br />and back then you couldnt just waltz into a bank, hand over cash and have your coins in an hour. it took days. then it was a next day waiting affair. now i am grateful every time i buy coins how easy and quick it is - but for some reason it seems like people cant figure out how to do it on their own - you dont even have to use an exchange anymore! <br /><br />now i even took the time to make a thread entitle NEW MEMBERS with links where to find most of the information but its like people just ignore the stickies and dont bother to see if the same question/thread was posted on the next page <br /><br />undoubtedly they are the ones giving the vendors who dont use pgp business and finalizing early so the community can continue going downhill and scammers can proliferate

They are almost exclusively focused on short-term, even immediate, gratification -- all they can think about is making a purchase! <br /><br />You&#039;ve got people on here, getting all whiney about how hard it is to become a vendor, when they can&#039;t even find the &quot;Become a Vendor&quot; link, for crying out loud! <br /><br />You&#039;ve got other people on here who are almost proud of the fact that they&#039;re virtually computer illiterate! Have they been inside for the last 20 years? Ya gotta wonder.&nbsp; You&#039;ve got other people on here, who claim to have been inside, and even tell us what institution, and for what offense. Like, WTF were they thinking?!<br /><br />There&#039;s hardly a day that goes by, that you don&#039;t see at least one of the following: <br /><br />- Someone using a clearnet email address on their PGP key: Gmail, Yahoo, even Hushmail, for fuck&#039;s sake! <br /><br />- Posting their private keys. <br /><br />- Using broken software like PortablePGP, iGolder.com and similar crap, generating broken PGP keys. <br /><br />All of the above have been warned about in multiple postings on here, yet people continue to make the same mistakes, over and over. <br /><br />From all appearances, it seems to me that the security IQ of the Forum is going in the wrong direction, and that does not augur well for the future of Silk Road. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=56078.msg533995#msg533995">Quote from: Wadozo on October 19, 2012, 11:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Rushing in and not doing some of your own research will only lead to mistakes being made that could change your life forever.

				Good to know it&#039;s not just me! Wise words microRNA. It must really piss you off when you take the time to contribute lots of helpful information for all to read, especially newer members, only to have them ask the same questions! I will admit that there are some new members who do the right thing, but they are few and far between these days.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> undoubtedly they are the ones giving the vendors who dont use pgp business and finalizing early so the community can continue going downhill and scammers can proliferate&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unfortunately, this is so true. The amount of people complaining they were scammed because they &quot;FE for a trusted vendor&quot; just blows me away! What about taking some &quot;PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY&quot;!! DPR makes it very clear on the SR Homepage to NOT finalize early and use the Escrow system. Minimize your risk!! On top of that, where is the common sense from some buyers? Not too common these days it seems. Paying an anonymous &quot;person&quot; BTC on an anonymous market place located on the Hidden Web for something with absolutely NO RECOURSE should a problem occur is just SHEER MADNESS!. Vendor&#039;s feedback pages are littered with FE comments. Some you can understand may be first time buyers, but as long as there are buyers who continue to support this practice of FE, the list of scammers will continue to grow.&nbsp; ???&nbsp;

				Excellent point Nightcrawler. There is a misconception from some people about the difficulty in using PGP, especially newbies. I think Pine and some other knowledgeable members such as Guru, have really pushed the message on using PGP. It&#039;s use is increasing, but as you say, if it&#039;s use is not compulsory, a lot of people just won&#039;t utilize it, regardless of what anyone says to them. :)

				Wouldn&#039;t be nice if people needed to learn pgp just to enter the site, vendors using it as mandatory goes against some of the founding principals of free marketplace but for people to come here and register without having to do any research just belittles all the hard work people have put into great FAQ&#039;s. I will agree that when I first read them some were alot deeper than I could comprehend as a newbie here....( lol pine and guru sure can get into some security debates :) ) but I have seen alot of simplified versions surface in that time. Most people doing the learning curve seem to help out those that are struggling but the generality of some of the posts means that we need&nbsp; a spoon feeding section. IMO it would be nice to have to Join, be allowed to have access to a section of the forum and have to obtain a forum ranking before having access to the general forum.&nbsp; This could be accomplished by having a simple test about stuff located in the Newbie section. and you would have to get a 10/10 score to obtain the rank. I am sure something like this would be able to be set in the permissions tab( but I dont do computers so could be wrong).&nbsp; These questions must not need to be hard or specific but general questions on were new information could be found on the site.<br />eg.<br />1. Are new buyers required to FE?<br />2. Is your country important when inquiring about bitcoins.<br />3. what are some acceptable pgp programs.<br />4. what is the importance of my PIN<br />5.how long can bitcoin transfers take.<br />6. what are common shipping time for domestic and international<br />7. should i use a fake name<br />8. were is the buyers guide located<br />9. how long should I wait before I accuse a reputable vendor of being a scammer<br />10 were is the search button and how does it work.<br />then have to send and recieve one PGP message to obtain the rank allowed to access the forums or questions that clearify pgp<br />what does the term&quot;******&quot; mean<br />*****substitute&nbsp; encrypt....decrypt....public key....private key....<br /><br />ok I think I have made my point or could;d just be me venting or rambling ....<br /><br /><br />
