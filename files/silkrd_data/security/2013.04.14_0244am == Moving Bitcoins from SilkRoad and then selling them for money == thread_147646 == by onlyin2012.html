				Hi All, <br /><br />What&#039;s currently the best way to move Bitcoins from Silkroad to cash money?&nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed that you can send bitcoins to your Mt.Gox address but I don&#039;t trust that and after everything I&#039;m seeing here re: Mt. Gox as of late I&#039;m going to stay away from them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m just starting to research and appreciate any feedback.&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems like <br /><br />Thanks,<br />O

				Thanks Donkeydong, <br />Sounds like I need to do some homework.&nbsp; Can you suggest some key word terms to search and where?&nbsp; I&#039;m admittedly not familiar with the fact that there are bitcoins meeting areas.

				Yes, localbitcoins works great. Don&#039;t be surprised if there are groups of people who meet up for btc outside of that, just have to find them and act like btc is your hobby too.

				So... if I attempted to send my (beautiful-drug polished) bitcoins from SR to Mt. Gox would they accept the coins and then I would simply have to move sell them for cash to Mt. Gox&#039;s site?&nbsp;

				Why wouldn&#039;t they accept the coins? I know they tried to block &quot;tainted&quot; coins for a while in 2011. Those were coins that had been reported stolen, but they gave that up pretty quick, because it&#039;s basically impossible.<br /><br />The issue here isn&#039;t whether it&#039;s possible to transfer coins from SR to MtGox, it certainly is. The issue is whether that is safe. Someone investigating transactions in the block chain, who has identified bitcoin addresses controlled by SR, could figure out that you&#039;re making money on the site, and MtGox would have no problem turning over your info in response to a proper LE request.<br />

				I hear what you mean, I&#039;ve always been doing the same thing, just get the coins, move the SR and make my buy to avoid the fluctuations and potential loss of money, espeically now since the currency is so volatile.&nbsp; <br /><br />What about just moving my SR bitcoins to my bitcoin wallet and then moving them to Mt. Gox sell them for money and then transfer the money to my bank that I have setup through Mt. Gox?&nbsp; This way, I&#039;ve changed my bitcoin address and any would be LE officials looking to track down bitcoins paths would be even more work on their hands?&nbsp; Ideally the whole process would just take place on line and I wouldn&#039;t have to really meet up with people to trade bitcoins in persons.&nbsp; In my opinion, the longer the bitcoins are bitcoins, the more likely the chances are that I could lose money.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Appreciate all the feedback from the community, this is definitely a pretty cool group of people. <br /><br />Cheers!<br />O

In general, the more address hops between SR and your cash out, the better. These could be actual wallets on your local machine that you delete afterwards, or anonymous online ewallets. There are some popular BTC &quot;mixing&quot; services that charge a small fee to mix or tumble your coins (BitFog is one, there are others). Personally, I avoid these as they are all possible LE honeypots.<br /><br />At the end of the day, you&#039;re going to have a cash deposit from a BTC exchange on your personal bank record. This isn&#039;t illegal or incriminating in itself (yet), but it will certainly look suspicious if you get in trouble for drugs/hacking/terrorism/whatever in the future. For this reason, I agree with the poster above (+1 donkeydong) that selling your coins locally for cash is the safest way to do it, even if not very fast or convenient.

If you choose to invest in btc, understand it is much easier to manipulate than the stock market. When one brokerage controls 80% of the volume? comeon guys, you know the finance industry is corrupt through and through. Why think btc is any different? With the ddos and the methods they used to do what you witnessed, it will happen again and again. And now as main stream merica thinks they can make a few bucks it will only get worse, i am glad things are closer to what they should be, i need to place some orders, i will feel better when btc gets adjusted to where it should be, it still has a way to drop imo. Good Luck&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;have fun sbmafia :)

				Lets say I doubled my money from the last BTC rally, and I sold the coins in the exchange before the drop. In my account I have a little more than double my original USD dollar amount. How can I get that back into dollars? I had to do this quickly last week, and I didn&#039;t think about how to get my money out of the exchange. It wouldn&#039;t bother me too much if I can&#039;t move it back to USD.<br /><br />thoughts......
