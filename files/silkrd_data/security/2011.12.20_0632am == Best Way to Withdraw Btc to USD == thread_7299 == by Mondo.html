				I know selling them for moneypaks and such is an option but anything automated and how fast are they and secure. Such as xfer to MtGox, doing a sale order, transferring to dwolla and then to a bank account. Is there any way to make this secure and how long would that process take? Are sales orders quick usually? Just the few hours transferring then sell before a couple days to bank account with dwolla? any way to shuffle things around to make this safer? I need to pull money quickly to keep in business and I need cash rather than prepaid credit cards. I know that this is prohibitive at larger quantities and I would have to come up with a way to justify the incoming transfers eventually and whatnot.<br /><br />Short version:<br />&nbsp;simply would they be able to trace the deposit to my bank account back through all those bit coin transactions and back to this website? And how long would it take to sell on mtgox or another site then transfer to dwolla and a bank account.

				If you want to cash out to moneypak (you can put them on prepaid debit and withdraw at atm or cash back in stores or paypal to spend online) or to western union message me on SR to discuss.

				I didn&#039;t realize you could withdraw at ATM with those cards. I did some research since and even have several ATMs within 1 mile with no fee. Do you know the atm withdraw limits on those cards per day or is it unlimited?
