				Hello Silk Roaders, and happy times. <br /><br />I was wondering does anyone know how to deal with an IP address block on Mt. Gox. I ask because I have just transferred some money to there from my Dwolla, and now I want to buy more stuff on Silk Road, BUT my IP address is blocked, apparently because I used Tor to access Mt. Gox too many times.<br /><br />For now I put in a&nbsp; support request at Mt. Gox, but they are not getting back to me very quickly.<br />From what I have read online, my ISP doesn&#039;t really give out new IP addresses very reliably. <br /><br />Is anyone able to access Mt. Gox via Tor or another anonymity (sp) network? Preferably one that wont steal my login informations and intarwebs identities.<br /><br />Thanks in advance, I will be even more grateful once I get some THC in my bloodstream again. Perhaps I should switch to tradehill....<br /><br />Peace out,<br />brickbeard

				Umm the IP issue is the IP of the Tor exit node, not your ISP&#039;s IP address.&nbsp; You can use the &quot;use new identity&quot; feature of tor to get a new IP address for future web requests.

				This happened to me too, I use a proxy to change my IP address, or use another computer if you have one..

				Every time I try to log in to MtGox with Tor I get the same message: &quot;Your IP has been blocked because of too many failed login attempts.&quot;&nbsp; Then when I try to log in via clearnet I get the same message.&nbsp; The problem is not too many failed logins, MtGox admins are probably blocking all IP connections that might be using any form of anonymization.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s a long thread on the MtGox support section started by users who are also not able to log in.&nbsp; Some of them haven&#039;t been able to log in for weeks.&nbsp; Words like &quot;thief,&quot; and &quot;scam&quot; are being used by people who apparently have quite a lot of money tied up in MtGox.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(

				Thanks for the tips!<br /><br />Eventually the issue was resolved by putting in a support request on mt. gox. <br /><br />They said it was &quot;failed login attempts&quot; that got my IP banned but that the ban only lasted for 24 hours. I gave them my IP and they cleared it quicker. In the future, I will not be using Tor to login to Mt. Gox, as even using new ID did not help.<br /><br />Peace

				...Or at least that&#039;s what I thought. I was able to log in for like a minute, and now, I cannot.<br /><br />This is suck.

				I log in to Mt Gox in the clearnet. They have my real email address, why should I create a link to my Tor ID and my real one by logging into anything that has my info?<br />I initiate transfer to my pc wallet and run Tor and then Bitcoin. And wait.....<br />Then use Bitcoin over Tor into SR. And wait, usually not too long.<br /><br />Is that screwing up?

				For those who were following, in the end I had to force my ISP to assign me a new IP address. Many ISPs, mine included, will not really do this unless you switch to a new cable modem. The key here is that your IP is assigned via DHCP using your cable modem&#039;s/router MAC address as a reference point (as I understand it). I was able to log into Mt. Gox just fine after I used my router settings to clone a new MAC address. I hope that helps anyone who has been blocked from Mt. Gox because they used Tor or other proxies...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1756.msg16152#msg16152">Quote from: bp on August 14, 2011, 01:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I log in to Mt Gox in the clearnet.

I am no expert, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s screwing up, but I may not be the best source of information on that because I do it too (now, especially after mybitcoin exploded). Maybe make a new topic specifically about Mt. Gox and clearnet to get some smarter advice than I can provide? Sorry I am relatively new at internets securitah :)

				I can usually force an IP change if I &quot;ipconfig&quot; to the modem after directly connecting a machine to it, see how long the lease on that IP will last and power down the modem for a good period of time right as the lease expires.<br />I could probably find the info going through the router or one of these great android network apps but a power off long enough for them to give your IP to someone else seems necessary.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming they hand it off to someone else while I&#039;m unreachable and I get a new one when I power back on.<br />Power outages tend to do this for my.<br /><br />It was a bitch when I used to use Window remote login&nbsp; (won&#039;t use that again) if my IP changed. It usually stays the same but I notice it changed a few days ago.<br />Might have been a service outage that caused that.
