				Thanks a lot phuba! What exactly is the difference between Mt Gox, tradehill, and get-bitcoin? Can I store the coins I buy on tradehill&#039;s site?

				Mt. Gox and Tradehill are both Bitcoin exchanges. I use Gox because they&#039;re bigger (80% of all BTC transactions have gone through them as per wikipedia and their homepage) and because they&#039;re the ones that I started with and never bothered looking at others. I&#039;ve never used get-bitcoin so I can&#039;t comment on them.&nbsp; As far as I know you should be able to store coins and dollars on tradehill just like you can on Gox.<br /><br />As for dwolla being safe, just use a fake name, address, and etc. and tumble all the coins that you buy from the money transferred from dwolla and you should be good.

				I can&#039;t seem to get to MT Gox in the Tor browser.&nbsp; It errors out, too many log ins from this IP.&nbsp; Works fine in Chrome.&nbsp; <br /><br />My first transaction with Dwolla went smoothly.

				Just know that MtGox is doing everything in it&#039;s power to cooperate with the DEA and other federal agencies.&nbsp; Don&#039;t believe me?&nbsp; Google &quot;MtGox&nbsp; money laundering&quot;&nbsp; and you&#039;ll find news articles explaining how MtGox is eagerly helping the DEA identify Bitcoin buyers.&nbsp; Dwolla is probably doing the same thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />So one advantage to using Getbitcoins is that you give away much less identifying information in the process of buying your Bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;
