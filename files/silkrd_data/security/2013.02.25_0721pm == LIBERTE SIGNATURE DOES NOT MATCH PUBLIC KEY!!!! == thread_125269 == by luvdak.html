				Hello fellow SR peeps.<br /><br />&nbsp;I verified the signature on dee.su&#039;s website for the self-bootable ISO and the signature doesn&#039;t match the PGP key. I downloaded the ISO and the ASC sig from sourceforge and the link was straight from the dee.su website.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the output from the fingerprint command :&quot;pub&nbsp; &nbsp;2048D/B37D8D87 2010-10-11 [expires: 2015-10-10]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Key fingerprint = E983 5D5C 4252 A3EB E0D2&nbsp; 2D07 FAD1 6647 B37D 8D87<br />uid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maxim Kammerer &lt;mk@dee.su&gt;<br />sub&nbsp; &nbsp;2048g/BDE7F956 2010-10-11 [expires: 2015-10-10]&quot;<br /><br />B37D8D87 is the key ID, this is verifiable on his website.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the output when trying to verify &quot;gpg --verify /home/user/liberte-2012.3.iso.asc /home/user/liberte-2012.3.iso <br />gpg: Signature made Fri 31 Aug 2012 11:42:29 PM MDT using DSA key ID 81DE1001<br />gpg: Can&#039;t check signature: public key not found&quot;<br /><br />This means the person who signed has a different key then Mr. Liberte. I&#039;d like someone else to verify, but I believe this would qualify as a bloody red flag.<br /><br />Please comment, please prove me wrong. I&#039;d really like to be wrong on this but I don&#039;t see how, I was able to verify the most recent sig and file from the tor bundle so I know I&#039;m doing it right.<br />

				Oops I got a little dyslexic ;)<br />&nbsp;It was his public key from the **Clearnet:https://zimmermann.mayfirst.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xE9835D5C4252A3EBE0D22D07FAD16647B37D8D87**<br /><br />So from my output &quot; pub&nbsp; &nbsp;2048D/B37D8D87 2010-10-11 [expires: 2015-10-10]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Key fingerprint = E983 5D5C 4252 A3EB E0D2&nbsp; 2D07 FAD1 6647 B37D 8D87<br />uid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maxim Kammerer &lt;mk@dee.su&gt;<br />sub&nbsp; &nbsp;2048g/BDE7F956 2010-10-11 [expires: 2015-10-10]&quot; The ID is B37D8D87.<br /><br />Therefor the output &quot;&quot;gpg --verify /home/user/liberte-2012.3.iso.asc /home/user/liberte-2012.3.iso<br />gpg: Signature made Fri 31 Aug 2012 11:42:29 PM MDT using DSA key ID 81DE1001<br />gpg: Can&#039;t check signature: public key not found&quot; The file was signed with ID 81DE1001 which is not the ID B37D8D87 as you mentioned was the one listed on the website.<br /><br />&nbsp;I also downloaded these files from the links on the dee.us website, which linked to the sourceforge files from the Liberte account. So the Key doesn&#039;t match the signature give on the latest ISO download.

				So problem solved, right?<br /><br />His key shouldn&#039;t match the signature on the download unless his key is specified as the one their releases are signed with. Copy/paste this into a terminal and hit enter:<br />gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 81DE1001<br /><br />This will import the 81DE1001 key to your gpg keyring. That&#039;s their software signing key. You can check the key&#039;s integrity with the command:<br />gpg --list-sigs 81DE1001<br />This shows the keys that have signed that key include Maxim Kammerer&#039;s B37D8D87 key. It looks perfectly legitimate. Now use the verify command again to check the liberte download.

The main dee.us just has his key, I think it should include both; the summary page has the signature for the liberte@dee.su instead of MK@dee.su. After clicking on the installation page I saw the other key staring me in the face LOL Derp, feel like a tard. Although I do think he should list the PGP on the summary page before or somewhere around the signatures.<br /><br />Thanks for the commands, those will come in handy :)
