				Is anyone familiar with banking rules and procedures within the USA? I&#039;m looking for information on how much and how frequently electronic deposits can be made. As well as the amount and frequency that cash can be withdrawn without tripping flags for suspicious behavior. I know banks keep records and report suspicious behavior to homeland security but I&#039;ve not really found a set amount or frequency as to what would be suspicious. Primarily I&#039;m wondering if $1,000/week being deposited and withdrawn as cash would be suspicious activity. <br /><br />I figure there are people who are forced to use automatic deposit with their jobs then turn around and withdrawal it as cash on payday. However the source of that money would be coming from a legit payroll company rather than a BTC exchange company.

				This thread is getting locked.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing you are a new Vendor Drachma? The threads about how and what to do with your funds and how to cash out BTC in large amounts are basically as bad as talking about a vendors packaging methods. You are just handing LE the keys to fucking you over. <br /><br />If you want to learn then ask a vendor for advice or ask DigitalAlchemist to be granted access to the vendor forum. Buyers do not need to be made aware of how to cash out bitcoins and it does not need to be discussed on a public forum. <br /><br />Locked
