				Hey guys, I guess this goes in the security section more than anything. This white guy dealer who i&#039;ve only seen 3 days of the past 4 months at an after hours has told me that I&#039;m gonna be taxed if I don&#039;t stop selling at the afterhours in my city. I have the best product in the place and that is threatening his sales, I believe. How should I handle this situation? He says he has guys who are around the place watching over him and what not. I never see him go up to a crew, he&#039;s usually just there by himself. I have some somalian friends coming with me tomorrow who are deep in the underground game. They want to intimidate the dealer for me. What do you guys think? Im also buddy buddy with some of the security inside and tipped one off about what this white guy said. I&#039;m not in it for the money, but I do charge more for my product because it&#039;s the only untempered with stuff inside the place. I just want people to have a safe time. Any suggestions on how to handle this punk?

				You&#039;re saying he said this, as in you&#039;re going to have to pay him? If so...&nbsp; (or was this just him theorizing and you jumped to conclusions?)<br /><br />Slip each of you buddy buddy bouncer guys a C-note and tell them to bounce this guys ass when they/you see him.&nbsp; Maybe ban this joker from getting in preemptively.&nbsp; The bouncers don&#039;t need an excuse, they can toss anyone they want... then if they feel nice, they can make some shit up.&nbsp; (But really in this case, they do have legit ground to stand on, they don&#039;t need turf wars going on in their place.)&nbsp; Dude doesn&#039;t have to know you&#039;re behind it, better that he doesn&#039;t imo... so do this without him knowing, it&#039;ll anger him less.&nbsp; Just get rid of him.<br /><br />I mean it doesn&#039;t sound like your buddy buddy bouncers were warning you off... so clearly they&#039;re not on this guy&#039;s team.&nbsp; Nor is this guy connected to the place. i.e. the owner&#039;s kid etc... the bouncers would know if that was the case and tell you.<br /><br />Bouncers want to do this kinda shit anyhow... makes them feel important or something.&nbsp; Door guys &amp; bouncers are always taking tips/bribes for shit.&nbsp; Money talks.<br /><br />

				Yoda has some good advice.&nbsp; I would let your bouncer buddies rough him up enough to where he knows that you are not one with whom to fuck with.&nbsp; Most people that use intimidation will only do it if they think you are weak.&nbsp; Prove them wrong.

				So this dude is telling you to get off his &quot;turf&quot; like he&#039;s some baller and your friends the bouncers don&#039;t even know who he is?<br /><br />If he had status like that, I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;d know about it. People who know the deal (i.e. customers, staff) would have mentioned him to you by now, especially if he came across as violent and controlling to them.<br /><br />Do some more investigating and figure out who he really is. If he&#039;s on the same level as you, just ignore him until he gets in your face or tries something. Then calmly punch him in the face as hard as you can, and get your bouncer friends to throw his ass out. I doubt a nobody will be back after getting humiliated like that. Make sure you&#039;re armed too, which is a given if you&#039;re working places like that.

				Kinda depends were&nbsp; your located. If your located somewhere in or around southern cali, then it might be true. Alot of southern cali dealers get taxed. But maybe this guy is gettin taxed himself that why he might be pissed. Just be careful before you pull any stunts

				Thank you&nbsp; guys! All he messeages in the thread have helped a lot. I&#039;m more of a calm guy, there&#039;s another asian lady who&#039;s been dealing there for years but she and I are good. She has people coming to her for stuff , I hsve my own people and I won&#039;t take her customers, she doesn&#039;t take my either. Mutual respect and we both make money. But this dude is pretty much an idiot for thinking he&#039;ll be able to boss me and let him take my money lol

				I would&#039;ve paid his tax then learned more about him. Is this guy a complete goof or is he connected. If he turned out to be goof then do something. Right now you don&#039;t know shit and could end up getting &quot;piped out&quot; which is when 20 roided out thugs show up and beat you half to death with batons for not paying a tax. Then they demand you work for them and the tax doubles. <br /><br />This guy could also snitch first if you decide to tell him to fuck himself. Welcome to the terrible world of meatspace dealing where you quickly spiral into violence. You can either choose to be a thug and progress to jail having to take care of this guy, snitch him out,&nbsp; pay his tax or find a better way to deal at that afterhours. If you already have customers who know you give them your contact and don&#039;t go back there. Bribe the bouncers to hand out your number. Delivery is much safer than clubs and word of mouth will spread instead of having to stand in a club every weekend. There will be another guy after this clown to try and shake you down for taxes too so they can move in to the club market. If your product is already out and popular who cares, you&#039;ve already bootstrapped your narco startup and can now progress into delivery with steady clientele. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t even have bothered selling there, too many cops/thugs. I would&#039;ve paid the &quot;asian lady&quot; to sell my stuff and worked out a deal to provider her wholesale.

				The best righteous thing to do is to personally confront him which is authoritative in itself thus intimating him a little bit after he threatened you, corner him with no bullshit talk and just give him a few cracks into the jaw with your fists or a steel pipe when hes off guard, then hold him close with a screwdriver or something up to his face and tell him you&#039;ll fucking blind the bastard the next time he or any of his cronies crosses your path, get furious, <br /><br />Dont wait for it to happen, make it happen asap and you&#039;l be at peace and have some credibility or face. Don&#039;t be the victim, be an equal or above most dealers but with respect for others.

				If the aggressor had it like THAT, then OP would surely know as others have pointed out.<br /><br />But, if OP had it like THAT, then the aggressor would surely know as well and wouldn&#039;t have behaved as he did...<br /><br />Which leaves us to have to decide who has how much backing exactly... Even if OP doesn&#039;t pay the aggressor, if someone publicly demanded OP give up money as a tax and that person didn&#039;t end up an example of why not to try and pull that shit with OP, that&#039;s a sign of lack of strength by OP...<br /><br />Someone could then try and force the issue of just how much backing OP actually has, and then there&#039;s violence, or snitch stuff, or other things from that category of &#039;shit businesses should avoid at all costs&#039;<br /><br />The advice to avoid such high profile and high risk transactions is good advice indeed.<br /><br />Perhaps try to collaborate with the aggressor, or at least get a better idea where they are coming from. might be a good idea to pay them a tax who knows what they offer... feel that out first.<br /><br />Of course the old latin adage applies<br /><br />si vis pacer para bellum

				You know what, fuck it. <br /><br />Catch this motherfucker by surprise with a metal pipe to the head, then take him to a conveniently abandoned warehouse and dissolve his ass in a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. Just make sure you heat the mixture and agitate it to ensure that everything is destroyed, including bone tissue and teeth. <br /><br />Why stop there though? Use these simple to steps to deal with anyone who might be getting on your nerves. I would also advise the use of PCP and mephedrone to focus your senses and, most importantly, help keep your judgement firmly grounded in reality.<br /><br />^^OK, now let&#039;s see how many negative karmas I get from neo-hippies that take new age shit way too seriously.

				^sourman, it&#039;s nice to see that you are looking for a non-violent way to solve the problem.&nbsp; This other dealer sounds like a clown but are you willing to bet your health and freedom on that?&nbsp; Plus, when violence is involved the risks of LE catching your scene goes up exponentially.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213650.msg1557130#msg1557130">Quote from: PinnacleGoods on September 23, 2013, 12:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Perhaps try to collaborate with the aggressor, or at least get a better idea where they are coming from.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />PinnacleGoods is on to something.&nbsp; Every dealer wishes they had the best product, and SR offers pretty damned competitive bulk prices.&nbsp; Your first course of action should be to consider becoming his supplier.&nbsp; Do you really always want to be selling to random people in the clubs?&nbsp; Let this clown do the heavy lifting and feel like &quot;Big Man on Campus&quot; while you rake in the cash.&nbsp; Keep in mind, of course, that he has a coercive attitude and like any other buyer can snitch on you.&nbsp; If you went down this path you&#039;d watch him slowly become your bitch.

				Read some Sun Tzu. <br /><br />The Art of War is all over the internet, or a copy can be bought on the cheap at any local bookstore, and it&#039;ll pay for itself hundreds of times over if used correctly.<br /><br />Sure, you could get your answers from everyone in this thread and elsewhere, and there are great ideas of different directions to take with this situation. But dealing with competition and conflict is nothing new to the businessman/businesswoman.<br /><br />Think like an extreme capitalist. Can you use him? Supplier, distributor, some other part of your network? If you can, there&#039;s lots to be gained from that: influence, power, a larger network, money, connections, it doesn&#039;t end. If you can keep him under your thumb.<br /><br />If not, then end his business for good. Either stop him dealing in your territory (as in move him to a different territory, through fear or incentive), or stop him dealing anywhere (see violent suggestions above).<br /><br />You don&#039;t want someone equally or more smart as you competing with you.

				Lots of great advice. Art of War is a book I wanted to read for a long time just haven&#039;t gotten to it yet. I&#039;ll grab it tomorrow and start! I think I&#039;ll try negotiating something with this guy first and see where that goes. If it&#039;s sour, then I have ways around it. I get to the place at 1am usually (when it opens) and I&#039;m there til 3:30am or 4am (when the other guy gets in or is in the place for 30 min or less) so there isn&#039;t much overlap. I make a lot of money for the 3 or 4 hours I&#039;m there, I get all the people who are looking to roll early. Thanks for everyone&#039;s advice! I&#039;ll definitely bring up the idea of keeping things calm instead of rushing into violence. I&#039;m sure he doesn&#039;t want heat on him as much as I want heat on me.

				Deal in club and after hour party by stand around and get customer is only small step above dealing on street corner. Use suggestions above. supply the people that sell in the clubs. allow them to smash each other in head.<br /><br />before any action take figure out what connection that clown real have. might be connect to violent street gang even if not look like it. your safety depend on knowing what fuck you get into before do anything.<br /><br />suggest you move away from personal dealing in that environment. try to supply others get a network going if don want to give up this place. or try to deal with smarter customer that buy rolls early in night<br /><br />

				That&#039;s actually what I do with people who I sell to. I tell them that if they like the product and bring me 3 people who are looking, I&#039;ll give them an extra cap for free. Even outside of the afterhours, the only way I deal to someone is if I sold to them at the afterhours and they&#039;re okay, or if my friends refer a friend, who have friends.

				^Good idea, that&#039;s how a lot of club dealers do it. Looks like you&#039;ve done this long enough to sort of know the deal. <br /><br />Just be careful if you try applying Art of War and objectivism to practical street dealing.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Deal in club and after hour party by stand around and get customer is only small step above dealing on street corner.

Not everyone can make their way up the chain and become the supplier, especially if they aren&#039;t willing to deal with competition that isn&#039;t cooperating. You can approach the guy trying to tax you and try to cooperate with him, but there is a good chance he&#039;ll either laugh in your face or try to get you into a deal that only benefits him. <br /><br />I hope you can work with him and eventually get him to work for you, but let&#039;s be real here. If you sell in person to people you don&#039;t really know, you need to be prepared for violence at all times. That goes double when you approach a rival dealer that already warned you that he thinks the place is &quot;his&quot; and wants to tax you. <br /><br />Without further details, no one here can predict how he&#039;ll react. Don&#039;t drop your guard because some internet users are pushing you away from violence. I&#039;m not saying to attack the guy at all, but be ready to defend yourself and POSSIBLY having to either fuck the guy up in the future, or paying his tax and working for him. <br /><br />I DO NOT LIKE VIOLENCE, but unlike some delusional man children on here I recognize that it is sometimes necessary. Not everyone is a master manipulator or traveling advocate of Laissez-faire capitalism. That&#039;s assuming a rival street dealer--a guy who may have already been in this situation before--is going to stand there and listen to you in the first place after he plainly told you to pay up or fuck off. Try to work with him, but make sure you know what to do if the plan falls apart.
