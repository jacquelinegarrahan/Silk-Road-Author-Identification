				Title: <strong>Incorrect PIN?</strong><br />

				I changed my PIN today, or at least thought I did, but when I attempted to place an order I was told that the PIN was wrong. So I tried the old PIN just in case I had not successfully changed it, but it said that was wrong too. So tried them both again in case I had made a typo, but the result was the same. A link then appeared to the wiki:<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;When you register an account on Silk Road, you must create a PIN. Your PIN is in addition to your login passphrase and is required when making a purchase, transferring funds, withdrawing funds, and when making important updates.<br /><br />If you forget your PIN, you will have 5 chances to enter it correctly before it is locked. After your 5th unsuccessful try, you will be redirected to the homepage where you will be shown a message with the time remaining before you can unlock your PIN. After waiting for the allotted time, that message will turn into a link to a page where you can create a new PIN.<br /><br />If you see this message, but you have not used your 5 PIN entry attempts, it could mean that someone else has gained access to your account and is trying to reset your PIN. If this is the case, you should change your password asap and change your PIN once the wait time is over.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />As I had only used four of my attempts, I did as instructed in the last paragraph and changed my password. Can anyone help a n00b to retrieve my PIN?<br /><br />
