				I know vendors have access to my buying history when i make an order with them, can they see what i have purchased or only final stats of my purchases?<br /><br />The reason i am asking is if i buy something from a local vendor and he happens to be LE, would they know what i have been buying and quantities?<br />I am a bit worried buying from locals because it is easier for them to find my house rather then someone on the other side of the world who will never come to AUS.<br />Call me paranoid but am i worrying to much or is this concern valid?

				Also, if i give him my Private Key, will he be able to access all my encrypted messages if he has access to them?

				All a vendor sees is this<br /><br />Total transactions: 0<br />Total spent: à¸¿0<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: X months<br /><br />They do not see what you have been buying.<br /><br />If you send them your PRIVATE key then your private key can no longer be trusted and should be revoked then you should create a new private key. If you send your public key then there is no issue. With a private key there is a chance that they could break the encryption or brute force&nbsp; the password.<br /><br />Though the easiest way to bruit force a password is to tie the person down to a chair and hit them with a hammer tell they tell you the password.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />

				Thank you for your reply, i think i accidently sent my private key and not the public one so a new Key is in order.<br />when i create the new key can i use the same details to create it or will i need completly different ones?<br /><br />I&#039;m glad i don&#039;t live in the Middle East or tying me to a chair would be the option first on their list.<br /><br />Thanks Again

				Time to revoke your Private key and delete your public key if you have posted it here, so someone else isn&#039;t able to read your mail or trying to impersonate you by being able to send messages using your private key
