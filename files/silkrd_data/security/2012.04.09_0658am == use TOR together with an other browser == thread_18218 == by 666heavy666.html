				Hello fellow members,<br /><br />I have one question about using the TOR-Firefox-Bundle. If I use it and want to look after sth with my normal browser in the same time, does it influence the security of the TOR-System?<br /><br />I read that you never have to use Bittorrent together with TOR. But when Tor runs on the one browser and you do same time torrent-download (not with TOR-browser, alone with BITCOMET or sth else), what can happen?<br /><br />Do you know what I mean?<br /><br />Risk I the security of mine or others using it both together? Or have I to use them alone without doing the other the same time?<br /><br />Thanx for help!<br /><br />heavy

				Just to confirm: if you are using bittorrent over tor and not browsing at the same time, is it ok?<br /><br />I&#039;m asking this, not making jokes.<br /><br />And what about instant messengers? Is there any lack of security use them through Tor?

				NOOOOOOOO!<br /><br />My question is can I use Firefox with TOR (SR for example) and an other browser (google chrome for ex.) together? Is my security by using google chrome in danger? Cause of diff. IP´s the 2 browsers use.<br /><br />Nothing with torrents, bla.<br /><br />Is it clear?<br /><br />greetings,<br /><br />heavy

				You could have problems if cookies get messed up, and a google cookie on your other browser somehow crosses into the Tor browser bundle. They specifically warn against this on their site.<br /><br />Two browsers at the same time if they&#039;re different (not both Iceweasel/Firefox) and you are not logged into anything in the regular browser is fine.

				IRC over Tor is dangerous if you accept a DCC chat or file transfer. It bypasses any proxies and initiates direct communications.<br />Jabber/XMPP is fine only with OTR enabled, anything else a rogue exit node can read your traffic in the clear.<br />Bittorrent is never safe, and clogs the Tor tubes with junk, endangers exit node operators, is all around bad. Rent a $5/mth VPS in Europe and torrent away totally anonymously, then just sFTP it back to yourself. There&#039;s a bitcoin torrent site now you can pay pennies to have them download anything and directly transfer to you without worrying about MPAA or RIAA spies.<br /><br />Better yet learn how to download binaries off newsgroups and switch to that for epic fast piracy, zero virus threats, and guaranteed complete anonymity.<br /><br />

				Thanx to all this good information.<br /><br />Better use one after the other and not together. <br /><br />I thought that it is so, but was not shure. Don´t want to hang out a sign, where stand up what I do, everyone can read.<br /><br />So thank u all collegas to be kindly helpful to NO-Profis.<br /><br />stay safe!

Just keep whatever you&#039;re doing on Tor separate from what you are doing off Tor, and you&#039;ll be fine.
