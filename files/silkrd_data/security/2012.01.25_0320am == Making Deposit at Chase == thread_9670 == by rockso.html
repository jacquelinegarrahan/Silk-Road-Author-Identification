				Hey guys pretty new here, have already used a mp and a sr vendor to get bitcoins on my sr account. Wanted to try a method that seemed a little bit safer than that. Planning on using website get-bitcoin and ive heard alot about using a chase bank deposit to deposit your money to this site. I was wondering how you make a deposit at chase, i dont have an account there and was just wondering what you say and what you have to do at the bank. Also at get-bitcoin it asks for an address to send the bit-coins you buy to, can you just put the address that is on your sr account page and have the bitcoins deposit directly into your sr account? I am fine with using bank of america as well doesnt matter to me. Thanks in advance guys, these forums are informative as hell!!

Walk up to a teller, or wait in line until they call you up<br />5.

				While I was typing this exodusultima made a post, but since I already typed it enjoy :)<br /><br />I used get-bitcoin the first time I bought bitcoins and was very impressed with there service; I opted for the Bank of America deposit method although I assure you the process is the same despite the different bank (which I did not have an account with btw). Basically when you place an order at get-bitcoin they send you an account number to make the deposit to when you make your trip at Chase. At Chase you fill out a despot slip, take it to the teller, hand her the money, she gives you a receipt and you walk out. Next you either scan or take a picture of the receipt the teller at the bank gave you and send it to the email address provided to you by get-bitcoin. It is incredibly simple and pain free, I should also point out that no ID is required for making a deposit.<br /><br />As for the address where you want to get the BTC sent to, go download the bitcoin wallet app and use an address you generate there.&nbsp; This method is much safer and guarantees an extra layer of security for you, ensuring you remain anonymous.&nbsp; This also ensures you have access to your BTC in case something goes wrong with your SR account.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any more question. Cheers.

				Sweet thanks guys, one last question though. at get-bitcoin they ask for a name when making purchase, is it okay to use a fake name here? and they ask for an email, i guess you have to use a legit email to be able to send them the receipt of the deposit?
