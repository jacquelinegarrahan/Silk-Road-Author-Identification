				You can trace ANY wireless signal including the signal that the network adapter of the foreign computer sends to the wireless router. You do realize that a wireless signal is sent in both directions right, or did you skip that class when you were getting your masters lol.

				Neighbors WIFI can be used as Tor membership concealment, so if the ISP harvests every IP that was connected to a Tor node, you won&#039;t be in the list. You can use a bridge to do the same, but if the ISP keep logs of your connections like here and will soon in the UK, the police can find out if your IP was connected to a bridge in a given time frame by trying to use those unknown IP as a Tor bridge. (I learned this from kmfkewm btw.) If the bridge is still alive, they can prove that you were using Tor at that time through a bridge. Of course you have to be already a suspect somehow.<br /><br />If&nbsp; I&#039;d have to choose between neighbors WIFI+Tor or my own IP+Tor, I&#039;d still go with the neighbors. Feds needs to crack Tor to get to the neighbors location, than monitor it until I connect to it again to trace me. Gives additional security layers from multiple ways of attack.<br /><br />WPA2 is considered unbreakable by the law here. Or at least in one case it was a proof in itself that the WLAN was only used by the associated client so a judge won&#039;t even considered that the AP with WPA2 could have been hacked.

The details of how the offending router is originally tracked down were not made available to the public. However, outside the van, the FDLE were using a Yagi tuner. It looks like a curved dowsing stick for locating water, but they use it to locate a particular wireless router. It looks for a specific signal strength and points toward the apartment where that router, and the porno collector can be found.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I could do this with my phone...<br /><br />Article two is just as dumb. All the have is a device like my phone which tells them if a wireless network is secure or insecure, so they can get an idea whether it&#039;s likely to be the homeowner or a neighbor piggy backing. Then they can look at where the signal is strongest and have a rough idea although this is incredibly unreliable and still not&nbsp; a magical mapping device. If for example a neighbor and the homeowner were using the wireless at the same time (not uncommon, even if the homeowner just has an iPhone that&#039;s on...) then the police device would be useless as fuck. Also what if the network is encrypted, which most are, then the police device is useless as fuck too, which is why in my original post if you learn to read you&#039;ll see I say &quot;break in&quot; to a wireless network, such as performing a Reaver attack in Backtrack against a WPA network which the police won&#039;t even believe you&#039;ll have been able to get in to and will think the homeowner is talking mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />Also here in the UK and Europe in court you, the owner, are liable for anything done over your wireless network if it is insecure, such as torrents or child porn.

You send data to wireless router. It sends data back to you. If it didn&#039;t send data back to you, then you couldn&#039;t very well surf the internet with it. If you didn&#039;t send data to it, you couldn&#039;t very well surf the internet with it. I don&#039;t understand how you can possibly think that you can locate the router without being able to locate the devices the send signals to it. Anyway I could give you links to literally dozens of news stories and technical papers about tracing wireless signals and people being traced while using neighbors WiFi, but I already gave you two and don&#039;t feel like wasting my time on an obvious troll / fed. Please by all means continue using Linux BSD with a two character password with a bridge you got from a drug forum&nbsp; using your neighbors wifi without using LE backdoored truecrypt, after all you have a masters in IT security so that must be the way to do things right!

And they did not take WPS into account. I&#039;m sure (I hope) a good expert will shed some light to these insecurities on the next trial when this issue comes up again.<br /><br />More than 40% of WPA has WPS around here.<br />11% of APs are WEP. Some of them has other security measures like MAC and IP filtering but still WEP.<br /><br />WPA can be cracked more easily if someone can get intel about the owner, like if I trace the signal or able link the SSID to a neighbor, got his name, address, type of car, look him up on the net, break into his house and install keylogger or whetever, use all that info to build a password list etc.

That is like saying you can follow a postcard around as it blows in the wind, but not a letter because it is inside an envelope. <br /><br />On the off chance that you are not fed or troll, I have some advice for you. Learn what the fuck you talk about, before you sound like total idiot. You quite apparently don&#039;t know jack shit about these things, and every time you say something it makes you sound even stupider than before.
