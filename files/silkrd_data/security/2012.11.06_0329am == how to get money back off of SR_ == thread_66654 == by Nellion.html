				to withdraw coins from SR you just go to your acct page :P<br /><br /><br />send them to an exchange and cash out, mt gox has been working fine to buy coins for nearly everyone, and some exchanges you can even buy gold or prepaid debit cards etc you can withdraw from i believe<br /><br />or buy drugs and sell them locally to cash out at a much better exchange rate

I could look for you if you&#039;d like? Modziw has a point with the card thing, as far as complexity and security, however you run risks at being scammed there, as I believe he said.<br /><br />mt.gox, for one thing, reportedly tracks that you&#039;re using Tor. Not sure on this though.<br />I&#039;ve also seen Threads here on Silk Road Forums talking about it not being reliable. Haven&#039;t opened these. I might do that today.<br /><br />You&#039;re free to use mt.gox if you&#039;d like, but there are practically as many bitcoin exchanges out there as there are bitcoins. The problem is finding a reliable one.<br /><br />Like I said, I could do some digging on reliable US Bitcoin Exchanges for you. I am The Criminal Consultant after all. :)<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />- The Consultant

				I guess my problem is- I CAN&#039;T figure out how to get my bitcoins back into let&#039;s say an instawallet AFTER TRANSFERRING THEM TO SR...<br /><br />There is an option to withdrawal from an instawallet, and there is an option to send BTC to another member, but NO OPTION to send to a wallet address.<br /><br />I can figure out what to do once I get it there, just getting it there is the problem. Could someone please explain to me how to send BTC from my SR wallet to a wallet that is not on SR? It&#039;d be greatly appreciated :).

				So... The withdraw function isn&#039;t to withdraw bitcoins FROM another account, but to send bitcoins TO another account/wallet? Semantics, eh?
