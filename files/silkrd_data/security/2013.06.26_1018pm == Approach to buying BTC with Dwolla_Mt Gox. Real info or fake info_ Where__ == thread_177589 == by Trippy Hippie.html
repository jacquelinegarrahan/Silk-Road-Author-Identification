				Until now I&#039;ve always used Bit Instant and cash deposit for SR purchases, but I&#039;m getting tired of the 4% conversion fee. Dwolla and and Mt Gox seem like the best option, but how should I go about registering my accounts??<br /><br />I&#039;ve already created a Dwolla account using my real info. They require a social security number, so it couldn&#039;t be fake. Not to mention, I&#039;d be linking Dwolla with my bank account (or should I? is there another way to do this step?) to get the money in the first place, so having a Dwolla account under a fake identity would look suspicious to my bank. I&#039;m not too worried about the real information here, because Dwolla seems like a reputable, public thing. I do still have to validate my account, though, which is going to require a phone call.<br /><br />I guess my question is, at what point should things go anonymous? Should my Mt Gox account use real of fake info? Does Dwolla or my regular bank see the account info I have on Mt Gox? If they do, fake info would look suspicious. With real info, I could always claim that I&#039;m a legitimate bitcoin investor or that I&#039;m buying for a friend. I would just be sending it to my bitcoin address with BlockChain (this is an anonymous account, as it&#039;s what I&#039;ve already used for the last step before SR). This could be anyone&#039;s bitcoin address. Does that seem reasonable? Or should my Mt Gox account have fake info?<br /><br />Also, are these steps enough: My bank ---&gt; Dwolla ---&gt; Mt Gox (BTC start here) ---&gt; BlockChain ---&gt; Silk Road? Or would you recommend me send the money/bitcoins to a few more places or through multiple BlockChains?<br /><br />As you can see, I&#039;m still fairly new to this whole process. I&#039;m interested in buying on Mt Gox, but I wanted to ask those who have some experience first. Any and all help is appreciated! Thanks :)
