				Hello members of SR, I have a question which might sound ridicolously dumb of me to ask.<br /><br />I just purchased BTC for around 500 USD and I got it into SR, I only have 231 USD.<br /><br />Why is this? Is it the rates which are not correct? Pretty sad honestly.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for serious answers.<br /><br />- JUR6&nbsp; 8)

				Do you have the same amount of BTC or a different amount than you deposited?

				The value of the bitcoin plummeted on Wednesday and has continued to fall since then. Unfortunately, it means your spending power has been reduced. If you can afford to hold onto them for a while, they will eventually start appreciating in value at some point ;)

				If you buy bitcoins you should understand why you now have less. I&#039;m sorry, but if you cannot understand why you have less money you shouldn&#039;t be using SR just yet!<br />Bitcoins were just going for 250usd per coin now its about 75usd per coin. When you buy bitcoins you take the risk of them falling to nothing when the price is high. Good side is you could also make shitons if you buy when there low, then shoot up high.

				yeah sounds like u lost some like everyone else.. <br />what coin service are u using? ive noticed bitfloor sometimes<br />will trade for your coins in separate smaller bids rather than <br />one bid for the size you want. hope that helps<br />did you have 500 in your sr wallet and then it dropped?<br />or did only 250 show up?.
