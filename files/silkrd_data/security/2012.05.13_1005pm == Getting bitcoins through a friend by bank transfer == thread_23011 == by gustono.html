				Since Intersango no longer do cash deposits and I&#039;m a bit wary about MtGox and it&#039;s lengthy process, I was wondering if I should give friend money, send that to my intersango account, bitcoinfog it and then send it to SR. <br /><br />If explained to my friend it is virtually 100% risk free (nothing sent to his house, no incriminating data on hard drive etc) would this be a good plan? I think it reduces the risk of me being caught quite a lot because bitcoinfog surely cannot be 100% foolproof and I would like to remain 100% anonymous in terms of my details and SR profile.&nbsp; However, my risk is that possibly my friend cannot be trusted under interrogation or pressure from police (most likely the latter, doubt it would get to interrogation) plus it means another person knowing exactly what kinda cash im spending on silk road and my activity.<br /><br />The only other option for me is bitinstant --&gt; mtgox/email --&gt; intersango --&gt; instawallets --&gt; Silk road<br /><br />That is a LENGTHY process, not to mention a physically draining process of having to create multiple emails, going to a wi-fi spot, using a computer that isn&#039;t related to me what so ever etc...<br /><br />britons, how do you do it?

				It would probably be better if a mod gave you an answer but buying bitcoin isn&#039;t illegal and there are other sites that use it. Get you a free wallet and have it transferred there first. SR tumbles it before it is deposited into your SR wallet so it&#039;s anonymous. Can you deposit cash into a getbitcoin.com account? Does bitinstant or getbitcoin.com have a bank in your area where you can deposit the money? They usually get the bit coin to you within 24 hrs if you can do it that way. Limitless or Bloodbath would be the better ones to ask about this but I thought I would try to help. Hope you get it worked out. Good Luck

				I&#039;ll look in to it more, might switch it up every now and then. Surely there are some british people on here who can share how they do it?
