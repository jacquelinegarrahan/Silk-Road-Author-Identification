				I&#039;m trying to be safe as possible. I&#039;m using a mac and trying to get everything onto a USB drive but also so about the tails, however I read that tails can&#039;t be burned to a disk because it&#039;s such a huge file.<br /><br />I put tor onto my usb flash drive, but it still shows at the bottom of my tool bar is it secure or is there a trace on my computer?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading all about how to be safe and the more I read the more I get confused cause there are so many things you can do. However I&#039;m hoping I can get some help which will be easiest way to do it and be secure.<br /><br />Thanks
