				WARNING: FIRST DRAFT<br /><br />First off, there is no ultimate security thread. Just like &quot;best vacation&quot; or &quot;best sex&quot;, if you believe it, then it is true. When someone comes up with a better idea, then the previous method was antiquated.<br /><br />Secondly. How secure is your network? Password protection between peers? How do you accept anonymous entities as business partners?<br /><br />How secure is your diet? Your food supply? Do you know how to grow your own food... if shit goes really, really wrong? Our species can learn to adapt to that...<br /><br />How secure is your transportation? Can you hike 3-5 miles everyday? 10 miles on a long day? If you don&#039;t suffer from a physical disability, then you are squandering your own resources. What about automotive repair?<br /><br />Nature creates a challenge that only an intelligent entity can answer. <br /><br />Food supply: Agriculture.<br /><br />Social Security: Gangs; Tribes; Landowners; Samurai; Sheriffs; Robber Barons; Carpet Baggers; Communites; Religion; Cities; Law; Firearms; Knives; Security Details.<br /><br />Consciousness: Awareness; Learning; Invention.<br /><br />Computers, as of yet, cannot answer complex human challenges. It requires a human to evaluate and program computers and their programs. Programs built on programs, do you see? EVERY security program that has been developed has been defeated... which means it was first understood. The ancient Mayan Computer (graphical interface on stone) has lasted 2000+ years. It&#039;s password is still secure, as the computer program has not been fully understood. It remains encrypted...<br /><br />Programs at the atomic level operate to create our A/V output... specialized for and by the human species, through discovery, as well as trial and error. It takes a vast amount of time and energy to create something new. Atomic theory is accelerating, and the approach to efficient photovoltaics--better than the photosynthesis in plants, but eons away from the efficiency of ecosystems.... the ocean influences the climate--agricultural and economic stability....<br /><br />Programs at the user interface (whether terminal or GUI) are specialized for human users. We have now entered into Internet Version 2.0 (I.V.2.0). Drugs and money are now intertwined with our computer networks. Users can perform anonymous tasks to accomplish physical and social goals. It took an enormous amount of resources to accomplish such a low-level of entropy: <br /><br />Law enforcement must now learn from the users of I.V.2.0. The current users have learned the techniques required to access a Free Market. If this continues, then the theses over Open and Free Markets regarding Consumer Protection is in need of immediate attention.<br /><br />Consumer protection must be upheld, but who is going to perform those duties? The Consumer. For this market to succeed without massive die-offs--as in Serial Killers and Enemies of the State who poison drugs and anonymously sell to unsuspecting teenagers and young adults--even precocious children are able to access more of the Internet than most adults--there Consumer MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS. <br /><br />Drugs are fun. Drugs are cool. However, there are a lot of people that want only money. Greed. There are other people that want only to hurt other people. Sadism. Drugs can even cause people to enter a psychological state of mind called PSYCHOSIS. Drug use is known to push people over the edge. Observe the history of CIA/Military experiments involving LSD. The evidence of risk is clear. Now imagine if that LSD was an unknown, under-researched research chemical, or RC. <br /><br />The effects on brain function are not known. However, we won&#039;t find our NZT-48 without trying new drugs, but there is a caveat. These new drugs, RCs, may alter our liver, kidneys, heart, lungs (please research non-smoking methods for consumption!!!! Every drug can be administered orally or sublingually--consider rectally if you&#039;re into that... and if you are adventurous: intravenously (IV)), pancreas, gallbladder, blood (Yeah, your blood is an organ!), duodenum, small intestine, ocular function, sinus health, nerve function (motor skills, cramps, spasms, seizures), and brain function. So there is a tremendous opportunity for multi-billion dollar companies to invest in RCs for the wonder drug NZT-48. (Have you considered that this market is not limited to domestic indoor marijuana growers and the Cartels... CIA, domestic and foreign governments... etc.)<br /><br />Consider another scenario. Take a moment to reflect how your mother or friends would respond to LSD if they were not expecting it. Now take into consideration that (almost) anything is possible. What do I mean by that? Anything is possible?<br /><br />A quick survey into geology reveals Earth&#039;s violent history. The dinosaurs didn&#039;t make it, save for a few: birds, lizards, alligators, crocodiles, etc.; turned into anthracite, bituminous coal, natural gas, and oil-shale deposits, likely buried instantly, as the recent Japanese earthquake easily and illustriously demonstrated. What lived in the ocean has since also been buried: oil deposits under Iran, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, Texas, Gulf of Mexico. <br /><br />Alternatively, to meet the question of possibility, a meteor may strike the Earth--extinction event. Volcanic activity might kickstart an Ice Age. Global Warming might create global weather disasters: tornadoes, cyclones, hurricanes, monsoons, tidal changes, thermohaline circulation disruption, yet unrecorded tectonic activities, higher temperatures, ice caps, and so on, ad infinitum. Even a fucking Gamma Ray Burst.<br /><br />Do you now see how complicated this whole matter is? Drug Wars? Are you serious?<br /><br />The consequences of I.V.2.0 will produce a highly elite class of citizens. This is nothing new to human history. These groups have existed since the beginning of the Animal Kingdom. Leaders will develop, and they will inevitably squander resources: AIG, Goldman &amp; Sachs, Bank of America, HSBC, DOW, McCormick, U.S. Government, Iran, North Korea, China.... What&#039;s the answer to this?<br /><br />How can we survive an anonymous and ubiquitous marketplace that removes all consumer protection? The same way we ALWAYS have. We must educate ourselves, our friends, our family, and avoid wasteful decisions and hostile goods through knowing how things work--and why snorting untested cocaine is NEVER a good idea. It is the cost of public health--every individual&#039;s responsibility. This perspective is supported by the Gaussian curve... the Bell Curve found throughout the education system. It is a thermodynamic certainty: Natural selection, just as in the electromagnetic spectrum, is distributed into an infinite number of wavelengths.<br /><br />Anything is possible. So when you enlist a fellow vendor into your midst, first invite them to a test. When the test is satisfied, then proceed. At least the individual that meets your challenge will have reached the mental independence from conventional wisdom, and transcended to a higher state of being. They will have become enlightened along the way, perhaps by tackling the challenges of the test.<br /><br />Challenge. Password.<br /><br />It is a way for special forces and military units to identify themselves when discovered. Otherwise it&#039;s the deep six.
