				I would really like to consolidate all my Silk Road activity onto one computer(or flash drive, I guess) running Liberte.&nbsp; I know quite a few people around here have wondered how to accomplish certain things on Liberte and the only option seems to be a custom build, which I finally decided I am going to figure out and do.&nbsp; So far, I plan to add the following:<br /><br />1. BitCoin client<br />2. Truecrypt<br />3. Printer drivers(label printing)<br /><br />These seem to be the big ones that people have wanted to have with Liberte.&nbsp; I would hopefully only like to do this once, so I don&#039;t want to leave out anything that I might want later.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

				Nice idea..<br /><br /><br />But why?<br /><br />Bitcoin Client isnt needed (maybe electrum without blockchain) as there are many good &amp; secure&nbsp; e-wallets&nbsp; &nbsp;like strongcoin &amp; blockchain.info etc etc or brainwallets.<br /><br />Why truecrypt?<br /><br />there is already the encrypted LUKS partition.<br /><br />Printer drivers are good :)&nbsp; and a program for printing labels and letters. <br /><br />You could also add a jpeg meta stripper...<br /><br />a prepared bookmark list of the top 15 site in the darknet <br /><br />And a prepared order managment tool with statistics ! (is there a SR API?)<br /><br />we would also love to see <br /><br />but in the end probably nobody will use it unless it has been peer reviewed or checked by Maxim Kammerer for example.<br /><br />But nice idea anyhow :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				Printer drivers sounds great, as does Truecrypt (for importing encrypted data into the Liberte OS, and creating backups on other OSes as you said)<br />The bitcoin client though, I don&#039;t know about. If you want it, I guess why not, but the slimmer the image is the better.<br /><br />Although I know little to nothing about creating my own Linux builds, I was under the impression that it&#039;s no small feat, and even harder to create one that&#039;s reliably secure to the degree that you want if you&#039;re going to be vending or buying on SR. So if you&#039;re going to go through the trouble of creating the image, you might as well get it peer tested and distribute it. I know that I would pay a reasonable amount for a correctly modified Liberte image.<br /><br />Good luck!
