				So i figured i&#039;d try to get some coins using the walmart moneygram thing through bitinstant that seems to be the hottest thing these days. after going through with it with a fake name and information the transaction seems to have cleared with zipzap but the coins never showed. I&#039;ve attempted contacting bitinstant via email but they never seem to reply. i hear they are a reputable source but nothing seems to be happening. I finally broke down and ended up calling their little quick help line and they told me to email again, still no reply. I&#039;m already in the hole a little bit and this just kind of shits on my day. has anyone else had issues like this? the transaction happened almost two weeks ago now and im beginning to lose hope.

				See this is the reason why I&#039;ve been saying for months now WE here at SR need to sponsor our OWN bitcoin exchange company. So we can cut out all this bullshit and make it easier for everybody. I think I&#039;m going to look more into doing this very thing. Because it shouldn&#039;t have to be a pain in the ass process to deal in a currency that suppose to be anonymous.

				I actually was looking very seriously into doing precisely this.&nbsp; The problem is that I have no way of automatic verification of Moneypak receipts -- I can automate everything else and go ahead and send somebody their bitcoins, but I can&#039;t automatically make sure the Moneypak was paid for and not stolen.&nbsp; Meaning the first day the service was live, somebody would get my account frozen by giving me a stolen moneypak :(<br /><br />If you have any ways around this... I&#039;ll really do it.
