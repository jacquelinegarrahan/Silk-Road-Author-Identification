				Hello All,<br />I have browsed some of the newer forums and, although I am sure someone has asked this before, I have not found an answer which puts me completely at ease yet. Currently I am using Mt.Gox and Dwolla to obtain BTC. For those of you who use it you know the drill. Up until recently when I received BTC I was putting them into my wallet and then once I got them, I was putting them into my SR wallet. My question is, is it safe to just eliminate the middle man and put them from MT.Gox to SR? As far as I know it seems like everything is encrypted and SR has a system of switching around BTC or something so it remains anonymous anyway, but I rather be safe then sorry. Anyone have any idea whether this can be traced back or if it is ok to do? Or am I the only one who is going from Gox to my wallet to SR? LOL. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond, it is really helpful because this would shorten the process greatly.<br /><br /><br />TulipSniper

				I also use Dwolla and sometimes MtGox.&nbsp; But, I never send directly from MtGox to SR.&nbsp; I always run &#039;em throught a mixer (BitCoinFog) before sending them to SR.&nbsp; If you trust SR to always mix your coins well enough then I guess your safe but, when it comes to my security I always play it on the safe side.

				I would continue to send them through another wallet between MtGox and SR.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t understand the technical intricacies of BTC, but I have read that if anyone were inclined to look at the block chain, they could see that the funds went from MtGox (your name attached) to SR, but wouldn&#039;t be able to tell what they&#039;re used to buy or where they go from there due to SR&#039;s tumbling feature.<br /><br />As mentioned, BitCoinFog is good, though some people find themselves too impatient for it.&nbsp; Instawallet is probably ok too.

				I don&#039;t really understand the technics of how bitcoin works, is it possible to see where a wallet is hosted? If so I&#039;d imagine mt. gox may give you some grief if your funds are shown as being transferred to SR

				Someone tell me if this is wrong, but I don&#039;t see any reason why you can&#039;t claim to have sold BTC in real life to an unknown person who you struck up a Bitcoin conversation with. You&#039;re not responsible for what the &quot;stranger&quot; does with the coins he bought from you. According to LE, he got you to send them straight to his Tor based Bitcoin wallet, but that&#039;s not your responsibility. If it&#039;s legal to buy Bitcoins, it&#039;s legal to sell them too.

				I have two online bitcoin wallets that I use.&nbsp; I pass through both of these as well as one or two Instawallets.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably overkill, but it only takes a few minutes and makes me feel more comfortable.&nbsp; I try to keep all my SR activity completely isolated from anything that links back to me.<br /><br />Mt Gox already blocks Tor users, which makes me think they aren&#039;t particularly friendly to people using their site for illegal activity.&nbsp; I don&#039;t trust that they would try to protect anyone if LE asked them for info.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Correction-&nbsp; &nbsp;I just read this on the Mt Gox website:<br /><br />&quot;We have been receiving reports that customers trying to log in via Tor and other anonymizing networks are having intermittent access to MtGox.com. The primary reason for this is more IP&#039;s are being added to our blocklist as a result of increased attempts to break into accounts since the database leak. &quot;<br /><br />So it sounds like Mt Gox doesn&#039;t intentionally block Tor users.

Is this designed to make your transactions harder to trace? Does it do anything? (I&#039;ve found several explanations of what an Open Transaction is but all of them register as &quot;herpderp&quot; in my pea brain)
