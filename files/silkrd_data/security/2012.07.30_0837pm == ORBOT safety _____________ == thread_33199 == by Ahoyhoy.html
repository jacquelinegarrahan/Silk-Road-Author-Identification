				I&#039;m using Orbot to access SR from my mobile. Is this any more secure than using my PC / broadband?

				Hey Ahoy:<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve used orbot in the past and it seems to function fine. Some things worth noting. The browser cache should be cleared often. Watch the cookies on this system too, they last an eternity. Orbot seems to break every so often, especially when switching cell network towers, sitting inactive for any length of time, or going from wifi to cellular networks. My only advice is restart the bot often. You also lose any type of PGP encryption on the android platform, so be weary of that as well.

I&#039;d say that 40 - 50% of my time on SR is via my smartphone. If I thought it was more secure, I&#039;d stop using my PC and just use my phone all the time. So I guess I&#039;m wanting to know whether there are security benefits either way.

				Other then the phone being easily concealed or quickly destroyed and not suspect of being the method use to access the darknet it is quite a bit less secure then a properly encrypted desktop / laptop / USB Key system. Data on the android is not encrypted and the file structure is shared between the mobile systems internal and external storage. If worried about your phone being confiscated it would be wise to pull out and destroy the external storage. This does leave any files internal to device there for the taking. <br />&nbsp; Running an encrypted system with proper pass phrase is bulletproof. I personally prefer to run a virtualized env with 4096 bit encryption. Sensitive files within that level of encryption are employed with an additional 2048 bit encryption scheme.
