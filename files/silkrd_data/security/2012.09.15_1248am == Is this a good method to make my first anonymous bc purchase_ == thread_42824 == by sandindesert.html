				This will all be done in liberte (can i use my home network or should i use public wifi somewhere?)<br /><br />1. Setup my purchase on bitinstant (to be sent directly to an instawallet)<br />2. Pay cash at CVS using the big red phone everyone is talking about<br />3. send the bitcoins to a few different instawallets and then to my SR.

				The purchase part looks straight forward but if you are ordering a gram using your home network would be fine IMO but,&nbsp; are you shipping it there as well.&nbsp; If yes then think of the wifi!. You have not mentioned the use of PGP for providing your shipping info. so I am only new here I am sure other more experienced people with chip in.,

Yes I will be using PGP for communications. So what part should be dont on external wifi? Buy BC, exchange BC, and pay all on wifi and then go back to my normal browsing on SR with my home network?

				I am only referring to a faq about it is best to ship to an address that is not were you are browsing the SR website.&nbsp; If possible it is recommended to ship to a clean location as an extra security measure. I am just a mere buyer and do not exercise this option just pointing out what others might say as being acceptable. Sometimes we just work at making something easy alot harder :)

				OK I am stuck. I tried accessing the internet using epiphany browser on Liberte using public wifi and it will not let me connect. I keep getting a privoxy error. Why can I connect to my home network and not a public one? How can I fix this?

				Strange if you can connect to one network but not the other&nbsp; ???<br />Try connecting to it without liberte or with your phone or something. See if it works with that.<br /><br />Also with going into CVS just for a heads up, you&#039;ll get on the phone with an operator and they ask you for a name and address.
