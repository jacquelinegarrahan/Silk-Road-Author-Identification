Don&#039;t just glance at them, read them thoroughly, and then read them again until you fully understand everything. Then come back to the forums and use the &#039;Search&#039; function in the upper right hand corner of the page. Then read the Security forum back about 10 pages until you find out the things that you need to know about security. Then learn how to use PGP properly. Then learn how to obtain Bitcoin anonymously. Then order your product of choice, kick back, relax, wait for it to arrive, finalize as necessary, enjoy your drugs and use the Search function for ANY other question you have. They&#039;ve all been answered before, and on the off-chance a particular question hasn&#039;t been answered, there are threads or posts that will give you the information you need in order to undertake your own research and be able to answer the question before you ask it.<br /><br />Apologies for being a tad unsociable, but the amount of people here that expect answers and help despite not doing any reading of their own, or trying to help themselves in any way whatsoever, really grates on me.<br /><br />Welcome to the Road, I guess.&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Unsociable? Thats a euphemism. You are lucky I am new to this, so information is what Im here for and not a attitude contest. Were we born with silk road protocol in our DNA? NOPE. we all have to learn and I love reading so thank you for guiding me to the buying guide and wiki. I have been reading about PGP and still dont understand it right. any tips on where I can read more about how to use it?<br /><br /><br />I hear what you are sayin about my question, butYes Im asking that question, maybe there is a mistake or something that somebody who just got to this site would not understand but a seasoned veteran might be able to comprehend and guide a rookie. you never know. Im hoping people buy from this vendor so we can see if its the real deal or scam.<br /><br /><br />&quot;the amount of people here that expect answers and help despite not doing any reading of their own, or trying to help themselves in any way whatsoever, really grates on me.&quot; <br />Dont let it get to you! its nothing personal. some people learn better by asking instead of reading. some people read and still need help. <br /><br />Thanks for you help. hope you are feeling more sociable. :)<br />
