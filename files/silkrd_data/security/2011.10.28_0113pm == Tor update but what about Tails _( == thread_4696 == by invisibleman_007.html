				Ok, on my usb I used the tor browser it asked me to update tor.&nbsp; No problem, so that&#039;s what I did.&nbsp; However when I use tails it tells me to update the tor browser but obviously it&#039;s Tails so that&#039;s not possible, AND there is no update (yet) for tails.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure there will be an update soon, but&nbsp; I prefer to use my tails, and now I&#039;m&nbsp; SLIGHTLY concerned.&nbsp; Thoughts?

				i also saw that pop up which told there was a new update, funny thing was that it was a pop up....anyways, i re downloaded tails(not becuase of this)....and the pop up never came and on the tor check it doesnt say anything about updates...i dunno...tails will probably come up with a new release soon,i dont think there will be much of a threat using it for now...just not sure tbh...on the forum it has been voiced so you can bet they are working on it

				i haven&#039;t used tails so i&#039;m not sure how their GUI is setup (or I&#039;d tell you where to go to start the terminal app), but if you press Ctrl-Alt-F1 that will take you to a command prompt. You can get back into x-windows (the gui) by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F7.

				Ah, you snuck an edit in there while I was posting.<br /><br />Tails uses the Debian flavor of linux, which uses what&#039;s called a package manager. Basically what this does is keeps track of what you have installed on your system.<br /><br />When you run update, it gets a list of any updates for all the packages that you have on your system. Then when you run upgrade, it goes out and fetches any updates your system needs, and installs them.<br /><br />You need to run it every time because Tails is on a CD, and so it doesn&#039;t &#039;remember&#039; the updates, so they need to be installed on the running system every time. If you don&#039;t do this, then you risk running obsolete programs.<br /><br />Is it all clear now?

				If you leave your Tor browser running during the process, it needs to update the Tor bundle, so it shuts down the service service in order to install the update, which would knock you offline.<br /><br />To make sure it all goes smoothly, you should boot up, open Terminal and run the update / upgrade command, and only once that&#039;s done should you open the browser / start Tor.<br /><br />Edit because I accidentally a word.

				the browser opens automatically when tails is launched.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp; wrote down the script,&nbsp; closed the tor browser and let it update then launched Tor seems to be ok, and that sounds very similar to what you seem to be saying.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love SR for all the information on this site..

				OK, I didn&#039;t know Tails launched the browser on boot.<br /><br />Yeah, you seem to have it now.<br /><br />For clarity, for anyone else facing the same scenario:<br /><br />Boot Tails.<br /><br />When the browser opens, close it.<br /><br />Launch a Terminal (command prompt) window by navigating to: Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal<br /><br />Type in: sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade [Enter]<br /><br />Wait for it to finish running, and close the Terminal window.<br /><br />Fire up the Tor browser.<br /><br />Party!

				I usually spend about 5 minutes upon first boot of Tails, getting everything ready, put a command line link on Desktop, open my wuala/swissDisk first, in a separate browser, and get my download ready, mostly just the bookmarks, passwords, pgp keys I&#039;ll need.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t be that hard to set up a linux package, that does all this for me auto, but it&#039;s cool to do it anyway, make sure everything&#039;s working.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, liberte linux has the persistence, but I&#039;m just used to Tails, and as the guy said, Tails has good english support at website, keep u uptodate on what&#039;s happening, what new dangers may have arisen...

				well I looked into this ap-get and there doesn&#039;t seem to be a unanimous opinion, in fact it has been said using that update can compromise your idenity?<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/todo/Temporarily_disable_Tor/<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/forum/Security_Updates:_apt-get_Sufficient__63__/<br /><br />Tails is working on a way to provide updates for there system.&nbsp; So I probably will refrain from using ap-get until then.&nbsp; Nevertheless everyones help here is greatly appreciated.

				Yeah, the discussion there about apt-get had to do with whether or not it was a good idea to use apt-get to keep Tails up to date, INSTEAD OF d/l and burning a newer version. In other words, when a new version of Tails comes out, don&#039;t bother to get it, just use the update facility. They were saying you are probably better off getting the current version, in that particular case.<br /><br />The concern was the theoretical possibility that something would change in the Debian tree that would break some Tails functionality in an old version of Tails. Note that this has never happened, it was presented in a scenario where you never upgrade your Tails ISO.<br /><br />So you should always use apt-get to keep the version of Tails you are running current, and then update to the newest version as they are released.<br /><br />Finally, after running apt-get on every boot, your first visit should always be to the page:<br />https://tails.boum.org/<br /><br />If there are any security concerns with Tails, including apt-get breaking any previous versions, that news will be on that page.<br /><br />tl;dr: You will always be more secure running apt-get every boot using the latest available version of Tails. The theoretical problem discussed with apt-get involved using it INSTEAD OF the most recent ISO.

				I decided to quit bouncing between the different distros a couple days ago, and just stick with Tails.&nbsp; I have the latest version...I think it&#039;s 8.01...the version that came out middle of October.&nbsp; It still says I&#039;m outdated, but anyway, I presume that will always be the case, since w&#039;eve no persistence.&nbsp; First thing I do is get the updates, u know, open the root terminal, then run:<br />&nbsp;apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install tor &amp;&amp; service tor start<br /><br />the I do an:<br />&nbsp;apt-get update keypassx&nbsp; <br />I keep my keypassx file (.*.kmd )&nbsp; &nbsp; stashed online, and get that right away, seems to make things go speedier, and I can put anything I need there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also put my passwords, usernames , and needed onion addresses in my keypass file, but I&#039;ve also used in the past, an html file, which I could make with the keypass (not keypassx) app, on windows, but the kmd files are fine, and it doesn&#039;t take but a few xtra seconds to install keypassx...<br /><br />I like the other distros--liberte and privatix--but I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll ever be totally sure where our efforts need to be directed, but we do what we can...also good, once you have it set up, to encrypt within encryptions, but, well, might have to study that on our own....

				As soon as it came out, removed old distro, and installed latest (8.01)<br /><br />I keep my keepassx (*.kdb ) and my pgp public keys, and my one private key, stashed online.)&nbsp; as soon as I boot Tails, I have a few things I do immediately:<br /><br />1) Open Wireless Connections, log into router.<br /><br />2) open a root terminal, then paste this in terminal: <br />apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install keepassx &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade &amp;&amp; apt-get install tor &amp;&amp; service tor start<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--While it&#039;s getting updates and such:<br />-I open and setup any linux/browser stuff I will be needing: need to go to &#039;Mouse&#039; and make sure I can use keypad, and slow down and set up cursor the way I want.<br /><br />-Go to my online storage site: recommend wuala or swissdisk,(dropbox is &#039;o.k.&#039; but too friendly to &#039;outsiders&#039;)<br />-Open the debian Passwords and encrypted files setup (forget name, I&#039;m not in linux right now) and copy/install my pgp keys.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; this file online, <br /><br />3) Takes 5-10 minutes get it all up to speed, then I exit tor, then open vidalia again.&nbsp; Set it up how I want.<br /><br />4) Now keypassx is installed, I get that kdb file (stored in same place as my pgp file) which has all my silkroad urls and pswds .... put correct bookmarks for main site and forums on my browser toolbar, as I open themr.<br /><br />5) Done.<br /><br />
