				I don&#039;t think their are any websites doing moneypak to btc. Only individuals. There are 2 reliable individuals on SR that do the conversions for you, albeit at a fee.<br /><br />I personally just used sugar mama for my conversion. Took about 3 days for her to cash them. Basically she waits until the bitcoins are ready to send to you before cashing your moneypak, so right when it&#039;s cashed you have your coins, it just takes her a few days to get to your order, as it&#039;s first come first serve basis. Above $500 MPs she has the best conversion rate. I got confused &amp; thought her rates were based off the total your converting, i.e. i cashed over $1500+ &amp; had a $500+, $500+ &amp; $200+, well the two $500+ i got a 8% rate on, then the $200+ i had to pay like a 17% fee, which kind of sucked.<br /><br />My first time buying moneypaks too. CVS/Rite Aid &amp; i guess all regular shit stores have $500 limit cards. Walmart was only place i saw that had $1000 limit cards. Keep this in mind. I would have had 8% conversion rate if i had just went to 2 wal-marts, but instead i got stuck with an extra $5 fee (from moneypak) &amp; a higher conversion fee.<br /><br />Honestly cheapest &amp; fastest way is bank xfer to certain BTC sellers who accept it. No id needed. I only not looking to do it cause i&#039;m doing $1000s at a time &amp; id or no id $1000s in cash in the usa is suspicious to anyone. Tons of people buy moneypaks evertday though.
