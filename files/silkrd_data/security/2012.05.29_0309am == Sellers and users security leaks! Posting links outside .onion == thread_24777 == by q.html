				I see a lot of sellers posting links and images of their drugs on regular image uploading sites on the www.<br />This is sites can easily be monitored by police.&nbsp; <br />They can see when IP and a lot of other info of the uploader of the image.<br />They can see IP and lots of information about everyone visiting the image.<br /><br />This is not good for security. Images should always be uploaded at a secure as possible place inside .onion.<br />No links outside should ever be visited for security reasons. The police can also place traps this ways, linking to seemingly legit stuff or whatever outside TOR and then monitoring everyone visiting it to gain information about users on SR.<br />If people visit this links by mistake without protection their identity can be compromised.

				I agree and the following current events may be enlightening.<br /><br />I have been following the Marsvolta BUSTED thread and it is interesting. He seems to be now more interested in security issues rather than drug scene.&nbsp; Seems out of character.<br /><br />If&nbsp; you look at this thread&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24282.0<br />you can see him setup the question&nbsp; about the security of going to clearnet from Tor.<br /><br />Then a new member called &quot;Replay&quot; chimes in and offers a clearnet link to check the security of your browser. It is also interesting that Replay appears on SR around the same time that Marsvolta said he was Busted.<br /><br />Replay has two posts and they both contain clearnet links.<br /><br />I hope nobody has clicked on them.<br /><br />_X_

				By checking the times of requests it may be possible to link a user to SR however they would need your originating IP address to do this. As I understand it if they have your IP address they can monitor your connection ashoal though the traffic is encrypted they could match your request time with the response time from the clearnet site. For LE to do this would take a lot of resources and they would probably need a big interet in you to undertake this work.<br /><br />Regardless keep sr stuff on .onion sites and don&#039;t expose yourself to risk.<br /><br />It may be a bit more hassle or a little slower. It essentially you will avoid LE scrutiny as they will spend their time either trying to bust big vendors or careless buyers.

				Clicking links to non .onion addresses is fine, no security risk as long as you can see the full URL and use proper judgement.<br /><br />You may have a point about pictures though, someone posting up pictures uploaded on a non .onion URL is not very smart, which is why they have .onion image services, clicking them may have the potential to give up your IP if you open them outside of Tor but I mean seriously, it&#039;s grasping at straw here.<br /><br />There are plenty of ploys LE could use to try and obtain IP addresses, but unless they can link that IP address to a vendor/buyer and a specific transaction with proof then they have nothing, which means they wouldn&#039;t waste the time and resources in the first place.<br /><br />SR&#039;s main threats are going to come from security flaws found in TOR itself, any data that SR stores on vendors/buyers and transactions (hopefully they don&#039;t, but I&#039;ve been surprised by the complete lack of intelligence/security in past carding forums as well), DPR getting busted (knocks on wood), or stepping up USPS security.

The biggest threat outside of those two things (that I&#039;ve read) is using a SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 proxy due to possible DNS leaks.&nbsp; You should use SOCKS4a as it has the lowest possibility of DNS leaks.<br /><br />The TOR website has very detailed information. Tor is like birth control, highly effective but not 100%. You can make it closer to 100% by following the directions carefully AND wearing an Internet rubber (Noscript).<br /><br />Going to clearnet links with Tor enabled is almost entirely safe unless you&#039;re stupid or very unlucky (like birth control).<br /><br />EDIT: Anonymous DNS servers are a good idea. Should I post a link to the clearnet?

				this thread is full of lols. .onion sites are safe but not clearnet sites! Uh, there is no real significant difference between the two unless you have misconfigured something and accidentally don&#039;t use Tor to follow clearnet links. DNS leaks can happen for .onion or .com. Hackers can target you from .com or .onion it makes no difference. I guess it is easier to watch a clear net end point and then try to watch peoples entry guards too, but it ain&#039;t that hard to trace hidden services so it is barely an improvement. <br /><br />Someone could hack you from a .onion just exactly the same as they could from a .com sure it is safer to stay entirely on SR because it reduces attack surface, but at the end of the day someone who can remotely pwn firefox can probably pwn SR then PWN you from SR server<br /><br />I guess what it boils down to is, it is more secure to stay only on SR because it reduces exposure, and it is very slightly more secure to only stay on .onion because it protects you from accidentally not using Tor and ending up in server logs and might protect you from an end point timing attack a little more, but the security difference between staying .onion only versus also using clearnet via Tor is very minimal and borders on non existent if you have things configured correctly

				Going to clearnet websites is fine. That&#039;s kind of the whole purpose of TOR...

				When I&#039;m on tor I keep two windows open, one is my Tor browser bundle window and one is my normal firefox. I use silkroad and this forum through the tor window and I only use the clearnet through my normal firefox window. I assume this is safe.

				Adding my two cents in on this one...&nbsp; <br /><br />Any security leaks that could happen is a direct result of the user&#039;s system setup and their personal internet habits.&nbsp; Any links outside the tor network(.onion) are not traceable because the site would get the IP address of the public proxy gateway you are using for that connection.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are not using the Tor Bundle then there are scripting exploits that could capture your cookies and various other information exposing you.&nbsp; The tor bundle uses an embedded firefox browser which is separate from your normal browser with the exploits turned off.&nbsp; Any other exploit is caused by the user accidentally installing something on their PC that would allow detection such as a trojan or add-in. <br /><br />You also need to keep in mind that anything is hackable with enough effort.&nbsp; <br /><br />My own security consists of a linux virtualbox machine inside a truecrypt dual encrypted file.&nbsp; The linux box runs tor/privoxyd on startup and i turn off as many of the exploits in firefox that i can.&nbsp; This is kind of to the extreme paranoia side but at least i know i can&#039;t be traced. :)

All traffic is under surveillance and they have epic datacenters to handle and mine all data they want.<br /><br />Don&#039;t expose yourself in any way while doing shady business.

				Clearnet sites are not less safe than onion sites -- as long as you are accessing them over Tor.<br /><br />The real problem is that a lot of people have a bad habit of copying clearnet links that they find in onionland into a regular browser. There seems to be a persistent myth, especially in this community, that Tor is only for onion sites. That&#039;s not true. It was created for the purpose of providing anonymous access to the regular internet (ie clearnet). The hidden service protocol is an experimental &quot;proof of concept&quot;, as the Tor developers themselves have described it, but not the main purpose of Tor.<br /><br />tl;dr If you find a link over Tor, you should only visit it over Tor.<br />
