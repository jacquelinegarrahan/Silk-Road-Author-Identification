				How can a name be invalid? That makes no sense at all. I myself am having problems with bitinstant. I may have lost several hundred dollars today. I&#039;ve checked all the receipts and bitinstant is claiming they sent the money to the right address. The address they listed is correct but the money never made it. So I don&#039;t know what to feel, but disappointment towards bitinstant

				I&#039;m pretty sure someone posted this a week or two ago, and their problem was that the name they gave while submitting information to bitinstant/zipzap was different from the name they gave to walmart/cvs. So if bitinstant thinks they are getting a payment from john doe, but fred johnson tries to make the payment, it wont work. <br /><br />I may be remembering incorrectly, but I&#039;m pretty sure this might be the issue.

				Yes, I contacted both ZipZap and Bitinstant. I&#039;m happy to say that they were very professional and helpful and I got my coins within 24 hrs. Still don&#039;t know what happened. Same names, but two of\us deposited to the same account because of the 500 max per transaction. Either way, I got the bitcoins and am happy with the service they gav to fix everything...
