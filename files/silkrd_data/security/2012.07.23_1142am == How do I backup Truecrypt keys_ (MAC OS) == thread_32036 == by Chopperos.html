				I&#039;ve made backups of my Truecrypt containers but how can I copy the keys so that if my HD dies, I can still access the containers but what about the keys?<br /><br />Any pointers anyone?<br /><br />thanks :)

If you&#039;re talking about the keyfiles, simply copy and paste them to another hard drive.<br /><br />Is that what you meant?

				You would back them up like any other file you have on your computer. Put them on flash drives, other HDDs, on a cloud server. I personally use dropbox for a lot of things. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how this is complicated?

				I hope you&#039;re just using TrueCrypt for a small container and not to encrypt the entire Mac harddrive because that&#039;s completely unnecessary, Mac OS X already has something better built in called FileVault.<br /><br />System Preferences --&gt; Security &amp; Privacy --&gt; FileVault --&gt; Turn FileVault On.<br /><br />Choose password and it encrypts your entire hard drive, and doesn&#039;t do stupid things that TrueCrypt does such as leaving your encryption password on the clipboard meaning it can be stolen by someone determined enough.<br /><br />It gives you nice recovery options too.

You need to be connected to the same network as them, and have already compromised their computer, and their computer has to be booted and the Truecrypt container has to be mounted. As soon as the computer goes off the attack doesn&#039;t work, but it may be too late by then because someone could already have your password and could just come and take the computer.<br /><br />This is why I always advocate using FDE as well as using a hidden container inside that.
