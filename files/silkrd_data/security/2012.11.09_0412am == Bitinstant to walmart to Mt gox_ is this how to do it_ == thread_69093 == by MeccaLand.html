				Ok so here is how I assume the process to be. <br /><br />I opened an account at Mt gox.. On mt gox I clicked on &quot;funding options&quot;<br /><br />At funding options I click &quot;cash deposit via bitinstant <br /><br />go back to bit instant<br /><br />enter mt gox account # , amount to pay, and email <br /><br />click send funds ofcourse <br /><br />OK heres what I dont know what to do yet.<br /><br />I got to walmart and look for what? the money gram area? <br /><br />Go there and hand them the payment slip?<br /><br />If all goes smoothly, then do I go to Mt Gox, click funding options again, click withdraw funds, send them to my instawallet (optional) and thats it. Send them to SR?<br /><br />Is this the correct process?&nbsp; Anybody can clarify this is correct. <br /><br />Seriously appreciate all feedback. Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				That is basically what I did but with CVS instead.&nbsp; The moneygram area wasn&#039;t very clearly marked but now that I know what it looks like I wouldn&#039;t have any problem finding it again at a cvs, not so sure about walmart but I am sure the process is at least somewhat similar.&nbsp; I just walked into CVS and asked about money gram and they showed me to this red phone.&nbsp; On the red phone I went through a few menus until I was redirected to this Indian sounding guy.&nbsp; I told him my information (fake name, street, etc.).&nbsp; Filling out a slip would probably be preferable, and is probably similar to what the guy on the phone asked me.&nbsp; Obviously if you are going to get id&#039;ed you need to give legit info or it won&#039;t work, but if you don&#039;t get id&#039;ed then fake info will work fine, at least it did for me.<br /><br />I payed the money, came back home, and my money was waiting for me at MtGox, bought my BTC, created a new wallet address, sent the btc to the address, then to SR.&nbsp; It was definitely more of a pain than a direct bank deposit to email or btc address, but it worked nonetheless.&nbsp; I would still rather choose an easier method because it seemed kind of sketchy but everything worked out in the end and I was able to get my coins pretty fast.
