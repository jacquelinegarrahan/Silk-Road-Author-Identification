				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new to SL and so far it has been a great experience for me. I mean this site fuckin blew my mind ! <br />I longer need to drive 20 k to look up the crazy fucks side of my acquaintances, trust them with my cash, and wait for them to go see some other people in order to get my product (usually ketamine) as I have to sit and chat with hardcore ravers about trucks, gasoline, stolen generators and what not ! They&#039;re cool people though and some of them are very friendly but their mad max lifestyle is sometimes just too much for me...<br />That being said, the road can be very challenging for a beginner, especially when it comes to security ! So while I didn&#039;t have any problems getting my head around PGP, this whole computer encryption stuff seems to be too much of a hassle for me. <br />As a matter of fact, I don&#039;t care about being caught for personal amounts of drugs, and I&#039;m willing to take the risk of ordering through SL while obviously keeping this risk at a minimum level is the name of the game...<br />So since I don&#039;t want to go through all this hard drive encryption stuff, what do you guys think about the suggestion in the title ? In the event of my house being raided this would ensure that thay don&#039;t find any SL/Bitcoin/Tor&nbsp; evidence...<br />Granted, the process of moving my computer to some other place every time I expect an order within a few days doesn&#039;t seem very convenient but that sounds less of a drag than say, encrypting virtual machines or such ...<br /><br />Any suggestions are welcome...<br /><br />Cheers<br />

				Making an encrypted USB stick with Liberte or Tails isn&#039;t difficult at all, using PGP to encrypt your address for orders is far more important and I wouldn&#039;t ignore that process if I were you. For dealing only with personal amounts, I&#039;d recommend taking the hour downloading and setting up Liberte/Tails on a cheap 4GB USB stick, and always using PGP to encrypt your address. Then you won&#039;t need to move your computer to your friends, you could just give your USB stick to hold on to, or hide it in your home since it&#039;s quite difficult to find something so small if hidden properly.<br /><br />Using VM&#039;s and VPN&#039;s is more about covering tracks if there were a pending investigation, not likely for personal amounts. If you connect to Tor, your actions aren&#039;t known but your ISP does know you connected to Tor. So if an investigator received this information from your ISP, your case for plausible deniability is weakened. If you connect to a VPN then Tor, your ISP can only see you connected to a VPN, and if your using Tor on an encrypted drive then you can safely claim you have no idea what Tor or SR are.

				Well thanks for your reply. In fact I already use PGP but I had the feeling that this usb stick stuff was too complex for me. If it&#039;s as simple as you say it is I guess I&#039;ll look into it ...<br />Also I&#039;m a mac user so I hope that the procedure you described also applies to OSX ...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You&#039;ll need a Windows or Linux PC to do the USB option, after you install it you won&#039;t need them though. You basically just download Liberte/Tails, put the folder directory on your USB stick after formatting it, and then in the bios of your computer make your USB the first bootable option. Then with your USB stick in, if you boot your computer up it loads into a different OS which already has Tor and PGP pre-installed for you.

				That&#039;s great info, thanks. So I can simply install these by loading windows through bootcamp...<br />One other thing : is there a way to remove all traces of SR/ TOR etc. on my mac partition without reformatting my HD&nbsp; ?<br />&nbsp;I have some pirated programs (adobe package with update crack) that were installed by the guy who sold me the computer that I don&#039;t want to delete... tried saving the apps on a stick to share with a friend and it didn&#039;t work out so I assume I can&#039;t save them because they need to be reinstalled. <br />In case there&#039;s no solution to my above question, I guess I could try to download a new pirate version off the bay but would prefer to avoid doing so ...<br /><br />Any suggestions ??

				It doesn&#039;t save any cache or anything so you shouldn&#039;t have any traces. Otherwise, other than wiping a drive the best bet is CCleaner. But in your case I think you&#039;ll be fine just deleting the Tor directory + installer, then installing Liberte onto a USB stick.

				I guess I&#039;m going to follow these steps :<br />- delete history/cookies/cache etc in firefox since I used it to download tor (already done in fact)<br />- run a search in my comp with tor as a key word and delete all associated files (including in &quot;recent&quot; folders)<br />- do the same for bitcoins and gpg tools<br />- install bitcoins and gpg tools on the usb drive partition (if possible ?)<br /><br />Does that sound like reasonable security measures ?? What do you computer specialists think about it ?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Also to add, if you wish to remove all traces of TOR ever existing on your computer follow these tips (!!only works for windows!!)<br /><br />1. Delete the Tor installer<br />2. Delete the installed Tor application<br />3. Empty your recycle bin<br />4. Run a registry cleaning software (there&#039;s many freeware out there)<br /><br />5. To make deleted data unrecoverable we need to cipher our Hard disk (very easy on windows)<br />6. Click Start (it&#039;s the windows logo in the left hand corner on your desktop) <br />-&gt;search Run and click on it, <br />-&gt;type cmd in the box that pops up, and then press ENTER.<br /><br />Type&nbsp; &nbsp;cipher /w:C:\&nbsp; &nbsp; (You can change the desired drive letter to example D if Tor had been on that drive. In many cases people will only have a drive called C)<br />Press Enter and wait for the operation to complete.<br /><br />Cipher works for specific files also. If you want to for example only cipher the ProgramFiles of your drive C, you&#039;d type<br />ciper /w:C:\ProgramFiles<br />Press Enter and wait for the operation to complete. Now only the specific folder is ciphered and not the whole drive...<br /><br />What the cipher does? It writes Zeros on top of the old blank space making the data unrecoverable. Normally when you delete a file, the information (the code of the file which is basically a bunch of 0s and 1s) still stays on the drive until the space is rewritten. Cipher rewrites that data and the data is destroyed for good.<br /><br />This is also a good thing to if you plan to sell your old computer if you want to be sure the new owner won&#039;t recover your private data.<br />

				Thx for the info mrmdam, I guess there must be a way to do the same using similar programs on the mac ...<br />Anyways,&nbsp; I am now running tails on my brothers pc and I must admit that it feels great !!<br />Now trying to figure out how to use PGP on this ...<br />Also what about bitcoins, is it possible to install it on the tail ??<br /><br />I would really like to thank all the people who&nbsp; take the time to help beginners like me get started !! <br /><br />Peace

				Actually, if you&#039;ve run any kind of software or program on a Windows system, which you&#039;ve subsequently deleted, and you wish to remove all traces, you&#039;d be best served by using some type of program which wipes all your free space by writing 00 (zeros) to the empty space. I use a free one to do exactly this - it boots directly from the BIOS into old fashioned DOS mode, let&#039;s you wipe the entire disk or just the free space, etc. The name escapes me at the moment, but there&#039;s tons of them out there.

				OK as a Mac user I&#039;m going to help you.<br /><br />1) Go to &quot;System Preferences&quot; panel, click on &quot;Security &amp; Privacy&quot; then click on &quot;Filevault&quot;. This is basically full hard drive encryption, it won&#039;t slow down your computer and is completely secure as long as you choose a nice complex password. Click &quot;Turn on File Vault&quot; and go thorough the steps, takes a min to start then 10 mins to encrypt your entire hard drive. Now if Law Enforcement get hold of your computer they will be unable to find anything.<br /><br />2) Now delete anything you don&#039;t want on there by dragging to the trash can, such as Tor, and press &quot;CMD&quot; on your keyboard whilst right clicking the Trash Can, this will show an option called &quot;Secure Delete&quot; which permanently erases the data you deleted by writing zero&#039;s in the empty spaces on the hard drive. This is unnecessary though as you&#039;ve already encrypted your laptop in step 1 above so police won&#039;t find anything anyway.<br /><br />3) If you&#039;re extra paranoid you can go to &quot;Applications&quot; then &quot;Utilites&quot; then &quot;Disk Utilitie&quot; and choose your hard drive from the menu on the left, next click &quot;Eraze&quot; from the panel on the right and then lower choose &quot;Eraze Free Space&quot;. This writes zero&#039;s to all the free space on your hard drive where they may have been naughty things before making them unrecoverable by law enforcement. You can choose 1, 3 or 20 times to write zero&#039;s, although 1 is enough. <br /><br />To be honest you only need to do either step 1 or steps 2 &amp; 3. I love Mac, it&#039;s a shame Windows doesn&#039;t come with all these security features built in.

				Hey oscarzululondon, that&#039;s what I call helpful stuff !!<br />I&#039;ll look into it as soon as I can.<br /><br />On another matter, after a lot of research on forums I downloaded rEFIt, installed it on a cd and tried to boot from the tails usb drive using my 2010 mac book pro. The proper&nbsp; menu loaded when I started the computer and the tails (linux) icon corresponding to the usb drive was available so I clicked on it, however this resulted in loading the windows partition ...<br />I&#039;m really at a loss about this and could use some help as this thing has been driving me crazy for a few hours&nbsp; now:o<br />&nbsp;<br />Anyway, gotta get some sleep ... It&#039;s amazing how this IT stuff&#039;s had me so engrossed over the course of the night!<br /><br />Cheers and thx to everyone for all the info... <br />

The actual encryption process does take a fair amount of time for a dozens-of-gb system, but is performed in the background so you can keep your computer as it goes. Windows comes with a similar system called bitlocker in its premium edition, but there is no reason to assume this is either faster or more secure compared to truecrypt.<br /><br />Also, it is very important that things like a windows password provide no security at all. If i were to take your primary windows harddisk and connect it to my pc, there is nothing preventing me to see all your files, your web browsing history, or your saved passwords. And i mean literally nothing, its not required to obtain your password in any form to gain this data. <br /><br />If you were to use truecrypt the contents of the harddisk would be completely useless without the password. With a typical installation that password could be obtained from RAM content for&nbsp; a short period after shutting down the system. This window is very short though - if you are able to prevent physical access to your computer for a few minutes, the data in ram will be lost permanently.<br /><br />

Or destroyed.<br /><br />Or... shuttled back and forth between houses if you prefer to go that route.&nbsp; Never be cavalier about getting busted, even for personal amounts...&nbsp; Just do your best to avoid it at all costs.<br /><br />Search for:&nbsp; Drive encryption, TrueCrypt, Liberte Linux, TAILS, OTFE.&nbsp; Use google and clearnet for this, and just read about the search results have to say.&nbsp; It will start to become clear soon enough.

				this post is an interesting read...<br /><br />but if someone did use the transporting laptop idea, would it even matter?&nbsp; if police are executing a search warrant on your home and property, do they need a physical laptop to pull information or will there be traces that your isp will be forced to provide?&nbsp; if youve been nosing around SR without being completely covered do you think its already too late?&nbsp; i know that in itself is not a crime but in connection with a packaged being delivered, would it be?&nbsp; maybe this is more of a legal question...
