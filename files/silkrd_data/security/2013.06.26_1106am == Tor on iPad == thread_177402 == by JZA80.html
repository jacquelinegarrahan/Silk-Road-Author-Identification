				I&#039;m using tor over my iPad, how secure is it if I have it on and check stuff like my Facebook app or email app? I still get messages on fb and email while tor is on (tor button) but should I be worried about any security risks?

				I have no clue, I use it aswell but I only ever go on the forums on my iPad cause I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s not illegal to go on the forums.

				It may not be illegal to go on the forums but if you are logging into the forums you are linking yourself to that username and also everything that username has ever posted on the forums.&nbsp; I can&#039;t give you a technical reason why the mobile device programs aren&#039;t as safe, but I&#039;ve seen multiple posts on here from experts stating that they are not.&nbsp; I tend to agree, and even if you don&#039;t; better safe than sorry I always say!

But on that note i think i might refrain from logging in on the ipad and just lurk the forums.

				Is logging onto public forums the only security risk? What about the other stuff I mentioned like my Facebook app and whatnot?<br /><br />Wait, so if you logged into a clearnet forum with tor button you would still be anonymous right? They would have your regular ip and know that you use tor? How is that risky? Sorry I have no technical knowledge of this subject at all.

				Its not a good idea to log into your facebook or email using Tor. You should do that over clearnet. Don&#039;t have time to type out an explanation right now, but you can just do a search if you want to know why. <br /><br />And also mobile devices are highly traceable so if you are concerned about safety, I would resist the urge to browse SR or the forums on them

				Sorry, one more question. Are mobile devices only traceable if someone is in your area specifically watching your activity or can it be traced by anyone anywhere?<br /><br />If its the latter what&#039;s the point of tor button in the first place?
