				Stashing drugs in inside a house isn&#039;t always the best idea however the one place where police might not search is in the middle of nowhere,<br /><br />Is it a smart idea to bury drugs in ziplock bags and such? (extra safe atleast 10 ziplock bags with multiple locks &amp; tape, thick plastic) depth: halve a meter.<br /><br />Will the cocaine/mdma/amphetamine&#039;s etc etc degrade under the ground? Will moisture be able to get through the plastic?<br /><br />Are there people here with experience (with the above setup, not in a box or w/e just bags)<br /><br />Thanks, segragation.

				How long are you planning on leaving them in the ground? Also care to tell me exactly where you are planning to bury these treats? ;)<br /><br />You might get seen buying them or with a spade shovel and could look really bad!<br /><br />What makes you think they&#039;d check the soil in your garden? (assuming you have one)

				If it is vaccum sealed well, I don&#039;t see how moisture can get in... however, recently dug dirt is like flashing red lights if it doesn&#039;t have a plant over it or isn&#039;t hidden well :P<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about that setup, so I can&#039;t help you there.<br /><br />As long as nothing is getting in or out of the bag, the goods will be the same as if you put them in a cool dark room (i.e. should be fine).

				I think the only solution here is to snort all of your cocaine and have a fucking good time!

				Bump.<br /><br />Anyone else have any input on this? Thinking about doing it for an extended period of time, maybe up to a year.

				Please try it with a plastic bag full of salt before you do it with drugs. <br />You would be surprised how easy it is to put your shovel straight through the bag without even noticing it.....<br /><br />From hard experience your best bet is to get some 6&quot; drainage pipe and two end caps. Cut a piece of pipe about 2&#039; long and glue an end cap on to one end to seal it. Put your gear in several smaller bags, put them inside one bigger one and squeeze all the air out before sealing it. Seal that into another bag and tape the fuck out of it. Put this package into a bin liner, tie it off with a cable tie then use another cable tie to attach a 3&#039; piece of parachute cord to it, make sure to knot this so that it cannot pull off. Slide the whole thing into your pipe, make a hole in the spare end cap and pull the parachute cord through. Knot this so that it can&#039;t pull out then cover the knot with epoxy resin to seal it watertight. Dig a 1&#039; diameter hole 2 1/2&#039; deep, put your pipe in and backfill around it with sand. Use soil for the top 6&quot;. Make sure to do it in a flower bed or somewhere where it will either not stand out or be easy to conceal.<br /><br />?????<br /><br />Profit!!

				You can also put an elbow to the end, and put the pipe horizontally into the ground with the top of the elbow sticking out, or almost sticking out from the ground, so you don&#039;t have to dig that much every time to access the opening, but the whole pipe can be deep enough so it wont be unearthed or frozen. Glue the elbow and all the other parts, the only place that can be removed must be the end cap. The packages must be small enough to pass the elbow, you can use 45° too.<br />&nbsp;

				If you are that concerned about being raided that you are burying your shit you need to prepare for ground penetrating radar.<br />A pipe buried vertically has a much less distinctive signature than one buried horizontally...

				people, people! There is no need for pipes and ropes and glue (unless you are so inclined or your stash is much much biger than mine), why not use a simple tupperware/better cousin with the locky clip things on it as an outer container?<br />For those of you thinking GPR - turn it end on and hide it under an ignious rock!

				These things are the ultimate solution:<br /><br />http://tinyurl.com/7clks3f<br />http://tinyurl.com/7lshvh5<br /><br />It&#039;s a rock, which even feels like a rock.... because it is a real rock, with a hidden hollow compartment which you have to enter a passcode on a padlock to get into.<br /><br />They even have an amazing unique overdose protection feature which is that if you&#039;re too stoned to remember the passcode, and can&#039;t read the numbers, then you aint gettin no drugs!

				You are absolutely right cache, a&nbsp; pipe buried vertically is harder to find, and more protected from environmental effects, so if anyone can dig a deep enough hole then do that instead of doing it horizontally.<br />The only thing that favors the horizontal position is it&#039;s easier to dig a steep long ditch, I guess.<br /><br />PVC can withstand a lot, not like plastics used for food storage, and it&#039;s always a good idea to use more layers than one, the material should be extra dry, and it doesn&#039;t hurt to vacuum pack it, add some silicagel packets etc.

				Does anyone make those rocks much bigger, like the size of a safe? I&#039;m thinking that would be just about perfect.<br /><br />It would cost a fuck-load to ship that, but I think it&#039;d be worth it.<br /><br />A giant rock half-buried in your back yard, when you pull it out of the ground there&#039;s a piece that you have to pull off to reveal a padlock which allows the whole rock to fold open with a huge hollowed out part inside.<br /><br />:drool:<br /><br />Someone who&#039;s handy... make this! You could make a killing selling these.
