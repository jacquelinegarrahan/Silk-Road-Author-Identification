				I&#039;m thinking I have a fuckload of viruses. This is a new computer, or was months ago and I was too lazy to get any sort of antivirus program. Can someone recommend me one that I could find online for free? Additionally are there any other ways to increase my computers speed? Thanks a lot guys.

				Depending on what kinds of sites you frequent and if you download stuff like free screensavers you may have picked up all kinds of malware and junk.<br /><br />Is your turbo button pressed in?

				If it is in fact viruses, it&#039;s probably a very good idea to sort it out asap. The last thing you want is a keylogger on there stealing your login details, or even worse, a backdoor or something that calls home (in light of prism, I would seriously not put anything past the US govt).<br /><br />For PC - AVG<br />For Mac - Clam XAV<br /><br />Good luck

				If you think it may have got infected, and has &quot;a fuckload of viruses&quot;, it&#039;d probably be good to start from scratch.&nbsp; Sure you can try installing antivirus and hope it fixes your problems, but some malware might remain.&nbsp; Best solution IMO is reinstalling windows (or tails if you only use your computer for SR).&nbsp; To answer your question, &quot;Microsoft Security Essentials&quot; is fully free, up there with the best, clean and simple.

				MBAM is a great program for mal-ware....AVG is a great anti-virus program also. Both of these are free programs and work really well! Hope this helps!<br /><br /><br /><br />Mr.Black

I recommend getting a pirated copy of Win7 (you can buy one for a couple bucks off SR), download it to a different computer, not the infected one, burn it to a DVD and do a clean reinstall. It&#039;s the only way to be (almost) 100% sure you got rid of all viruses.<br /><br />Also, stop visiting free pron sites. ;)<br />

A lot of college students can download it for free anyways...<br /><br />Regarding anti-virus background agents: Total bullshit. All they do is give people a false impression of security. If you were to rob a bank, would you do it in a publicly known way that everyone would notice right away? People developing serious malware know their shit and always are one step ahead.<br /><br />With virii it&#039;s like with STDs... Be educated and don&#039;t catch them in the first place. Even the oh so cute girl next door could have them.<br />Well what&#039;s different is that you can&#039;t format and reinstall your dick ;D
