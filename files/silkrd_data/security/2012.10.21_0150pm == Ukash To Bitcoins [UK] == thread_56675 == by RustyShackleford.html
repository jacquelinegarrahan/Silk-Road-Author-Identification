				I have purchased a couple of Bitcoin vouchers (Â£30 each). I would like to exchange these into BTC. I know there is a website that offers such a service, I was on it earlier, but I forgot it now...<br /><br />It is very important that my anonymity is kept 100% in tact.<br /><br />1) Where is somewhere reputable which offers such a service (UKASH to BTC)<br />2) Where do I get the Bitcoins sent to when I am asked to provide a BTC address. Where is somewhere safe and anonymous I can get them sent?<br />3) What further steps must I take from this point to get them to Silk Road where I can make my purchases without risking my freedom?<br /><br />I appreciate your help.

				localbitcoins.com send coins to your locabitcoins.com wallet then to bitcoinfog then to SR. Or skip one of the steps if your less paranoid and dont want to incur a 3% charge for bitcoinfog.

If you&#039;ve nothing tying you to the UKASH you used to buy the BTC it should be safe.<br /><br />Of course it is less safe in the sense that your BTC are on the SR wallet &amp; if SR is hacked or shut down they&#039;re gone, as opposed to being kept on your own wallet on a USB stick. That said I suspect your not planning to keep the BTC for long periods so you might consider it an acceptable risk.

				Thanks Oompaloompa :-) Thanks to all your advices I finally took the leap and can answer to the first question of this subject : if you&#039;re looking for someone to exchange your UKash vouchers just ask &quot;DonnyBerger&quot;<br />I bought a Ukash voucher this morning and got the bitcoins on my sr account a few hours later :-)

				If you want to exchange UKash to BTC, I recommend creating a Neteller account.&nbsp; You can deposit UKash coupons into your Neteller account for a 3% fee.&nbsp; You do not need to verify your account or anything, the daily deposit limit for an unverified account is still fairly high (around $250 I think).&nbsp; Now you need to create an account on VirWox.&nbsp; On VirWox, you can deposit from your Neteller account for 4.9% (no deposit limit).&nbsp; Note that while VirWox allows you to directly deposit UKash into your VirWox account, this isn&#039;t recommended, as the fee is an outrageous 20%.&nbsp; Doing it through Neteller first will result in a lower fee of 3 + 4.9 = 7.9% (approx.).&nbsp; Once the cash is in your VirWox account (it can be USD/EUR/GBP) you actually have to convert it to SLL first, then convert the SLL to BTC (SLL is another sort of virtual currency, but it&#039;s not important).&nbsp; This is done in a fairly similar manner as most exchanges, with market orders and limit orders available.&nbsp; However, the fees start out high (2.9%).&nbsp; I only use the UKash&gt;Neteller&gt;VirWox method if I need BTC fast, since this can all be done immediately once I have the UKash voucher.&nbsp; I can get UKash vouchers at the Esso down the street, or I can even get them online paying through PayPal on websites like pcgamesupply and onecard.&nbsp; Again, on top of all the other fees you have to pay, these websites take around a 10% commission themselves.&nbsp; Expensive stuff.&nbsp; If you have PayPal, you can deposit directly from PayPal into VirWox for a lower fee (3.4% vs 7.9%).&nbsp; The only letdown is that the deposit limits start fairly low.&nbsp; So if I need BTC immediately now (and since bitinstant online bank transfers are down) the first option is PayPal through VirWox, but if the deposit limit is reached, the next option is UKash through Neteller through VirWox, in which there is no deposit limit.&nbsp; If I had time, I would use a website that allows direct cash deposits into their bank account to avoid fees.&nbsp; These websites, however, usually only accept cash from the one country that their website is based in, so you&#039;d have to find one for your particular country.

				I don&#039;t suppose it makes much odds unless you would otherwise be sending them through an anonymiser type service, bitcoinfog or similar. It&#039;s not tricky to bounce them through another wallet first though, use a free one on blockchain.info or similar...<br />jf303: I believe donny berger has a tormail account, it&#039;s in some of his posts, have you tried that?
