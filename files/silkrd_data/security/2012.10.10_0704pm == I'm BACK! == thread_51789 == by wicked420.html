				I took quite the vacation from Tor, as bitcoins were very very unstable when I was last around.&nbsp; However, I&#039;ve got my server back up on Tor and I&#039;m currently working on obtaining some bitcoins again!<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if any of my old buds are around, I was a frequent member of the irc network, and I tried to help out as many of the newcomers get used to GPG as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />All of my old tutorials and my GPG key hosting scripts are still up and available online.&nbsp; http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/ <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure which sites are still running or defunct that are on my guide , so please bear with me as I update my site and my GPG keys used.<br /><br />Hello to all my old friends, and hello to the newcomers as well!&nbsp; Lets have some fun!

				Well wonderful!&nbsp; glad the tutorials werent lost forever.&nbsp; I actually had to look them up to get myself back up and running again!<br />&nbsp;<br />And I thank you for giving my code some use and character.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to contribute with simple little tools.&nbsp; I guess cause I&#039;m a simple little tool myself !&nbsp; =)&nbsp; I made TorID just so I could keep all my personal information in a secure location off of SR, and wanted to test and make sure I did it right myself before embarrassing myself here, haha.&nbsp; My little onion has managed to make the hidden wiki and onion search as well.&nbsp; Its nice to be used; when you&#039;re a tool!<br /><br />Thanks again, and nice to meet you!<br />-wicked

				mito - the same way we can be sure you&#039;re not ?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure the point of this question....&nbsp; <br /><br />I manage my own onion with guides and support that gets referenced by SR all the time.&nbsp; I was a pretty active member&nbsp; of the community for several months before I took a bitcoin break.&nbsp; I&#039;m transparent, friendly, and willing to be a part of the community and help out anyway I can.<br /><br />The rest is up to you, I guess to either trust the situation, or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I could just not contribute to the forum at all, stay low profile, and just order off the main site, but I actually enjoy community, and enjoy helping people be more secure and safe in their transactions here.&nbsp; But thanks for putting me on the defensive rather than welcoming an old user and active community member back.<br /><br />To the others, thank you for the warm response!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Yankee - the &quot;clipboard&quot; in cleopatra is your windows clipboard.&nbsp; when you copy and paste in windows , you&#039;re copying to your clipboard, and pasting from your clipboard.<br /><br />So: type your message in notepad , select all(crtl+a)/copy(crtl+c) - and then right click kleo - clipboard - encrypt - when you&#039;re done encrypting, your encrypted message is ready to paste -&nbsp; crtl+v

				Ok so I know how to encrypt using my own key and decrypt that. It&#039;s adding public keys I don&#039;t understand how to do. I know once I figure this out I&#039;m going to feel like a complete idiot. Thanks for the patience everybody.
