				So I have some customers (not on Silk Road... we&#039;ll be here selling soon enough :)) that would like to buy product with Western Union. <br /><br />Now I know that you can pick up money with out ID.&nbsp; My understanding is that I need to do the following: <br /><br />a. give my customer a fake address<br />b. ask my customer to fill out the security question and give me the answer <br />c. HERE&#039;S WHERE I&#039;M UNSURE : does the customer check off a box on the form that says I can pick up without ID or do they have to tell the person at the counter to do it when they are sending it?<br />d. give me the MTCN #<br /><br /><br />If thats all completed I can go to any western union after it is been sent, give the MTCN to the teller, answer the security question and pick up my money.

				Westernunion pickups are a lot riskier than accepting bitcoin. I advice against it. <br />&nbsp;Every order can be a sting, also wu agents have camera&#039;s.<br /><br />Would be better if you could get them to sent you moneypak codes/ukash or anything else you can exchange to bitcoin.

				Never use Western Union. They use special forms that are treated to pickup fingerprints supereasy.<br /><br />Their fees are also expensive. That kind of thing adds up over time.<br /><br />Also, if that wasn&#039;t enough, the police are probably waiting for you. Even if it&#039;s not true this time, it will be if you do this enough times. e.g. 3<br /><br />Also, CCTV, image recog tech, infinite storage space...<br /><br />If you want to move serious capital, either use B$ over time or study PolyFront&#039;s dead drop systems for cash.<br /><br />In the long term, Bitcoin&#039;s biggest advantage is that assets cannot be seized if you take appropriate measures.

				Under a thousand bucks u can send without id.<br /><br />As for receives I have to ID everybody :(<br /><br />Also yea, cameras.<br /><br />Also, they train to be interrogative and lookout for suspicious transactions and transactions that don&#039;t make sense. You&#039;d have to make up a story and stick with it.<br /><br />And... yea, WU is what got fm busted up.<br /><br />I would suggest not even doing business with these buyers.

				The only good thing about WU is the fast transaction speed, that&#039;s why all our east-european friends use it to quickly transfer funds withdrawn from hijacked bank accounts etc.. <br />Never accept WU from customers unless you have someone in a foreign country with fake id that can accept payment for you,. <br />If you really want to accept WU look around on the russian fraud forums for people that provide this service.

				I don&#039;t understand, are we just talking about a money order?<br /><br />In this US, a suspicious activity report (SAR) is filed for a money order only if it is over $3000, or if the teller feels that there is something suspicious going on. Most places won&#039;t even do a money order over $1000. No ID is required, and there is nothing tying the recipient nor the purchaser of the MO to the money except some cameras. Am I missing something? <br /><br />I guess I&#039;ve never wired money before. Do you send it over the phone?

				I&#039;m not saying to use it on this website. I&#039;m just saying that it can be applied somewhat anonymously.
