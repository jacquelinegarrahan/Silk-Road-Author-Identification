				I&#039;m going out of town and I was wondering if it was safe to still purchase products on SR knowing that they may arrive while I am out of town, I believe we will be canceling our mail and to be honest it worries me a little to have it sitting at the post office or something. Is this a false worry? Is it okay to get stuff shipped while I am gone? It won&#039;t just be sitting in mailbox for someone to steal they will be holding our mail for that week.<br /><br />Thanks for help &lt;3

				I doubt they&#039;re anymore likely to open/inspect a package because they&#039;re holding it for you than they would be if it were delivered. I suppose theft could be a legitimate worry, a sticky-fingered postal worker sees a package laying around for a week, figures no ones paying attention...<br /><br />Hard to tell without knowing their protocol for stored mail to be delivered after a certain date, I imagine they lock it up;&nbsp; but if they&#039;re not actively looking at your mail I wouldn&#039;t worry about confiscation.

				i would rather not cancel my mail n take my chances with it being in my box when i got back. if you do have it sitting down there at the p.o. i would only be really worried if it was like some stinky chronic that may permeate through vac bags over time. so it would have a lot to do with what substance it was. also if youve ordered from a respected seller they probably have their packaging down to a science to where it blends in with regular everyday mailable shit.

				Well, sort of? <br /><br />Canceling/forwarding would probably attract more attention than just letting it pile up. <br /><br />On the other hand, the longer anything sits in one place, the more the odds of something happening to it go up. <br /><br />Sometimes it can&#039;t be avoided (family emergency, mis-timed delay at customs, etc), but if it does I would err on the side of either letting it sit in the mailbox or having a very very close friend pick it up for you (and you better tell them what they are picking up, so they can decide for themselves if they want to take the risk). <br /><br />Judgement call though. If your mail goes in a slot in your door and then sits in your living room until you get home, you are pretty darn safe from anyone noticing. If it sits on your front porch and your neighbor is a cop who lets his drug sniffing dog run out to take a dump on your lawn, it&#039;s a very unsafe situation. If your mailbox tends to rip letters when three or four days&#039; worth of mail is crammed in after it, it&#039;s unsafe. If your mailbox just drops new mail on top of old mail and nothing gets mangled/torn open, it&#039;s pretty safe. If you live with your parents and they tend to open your mail, it&#039;s a really unsafe situation. So on and so on and so on.

				Depends on your location for whether it&#039;s &quot;safe&quot; or not.....HOWEVER it is a bit rude to the vendors that you&#039;ve ordered from since you won&#039;t be able to finalize quickly after you have received your pkgs.&nbsp; If it&#039;s just a day or so that&#039;s not that big a deal but any longer and you are making them wait longer than they should for the BTC to be released....or are you finalizing early because these are trusted vendors you&#039;ve used before?<br /><br />Just my thoughts.....
