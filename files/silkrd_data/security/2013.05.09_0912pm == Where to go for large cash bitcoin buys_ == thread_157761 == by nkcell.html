				Try localbitcoins.com...I sure wish I could sell you some. <br /><br />I mine bitcoins with my avalon and have so many it is a struggle to get ride of without losing so much money to fees. <br />I sell them on LBC and single transactions have been up to $3000. Sales though range from $0 a day up to $6000 so it all varies.<br /><br />Bank actually called about all my transactions, luckily I live a safe life and only use SR to buy pot when I am going to the cottage because<br />I do not live a lifestyle that allows me to know anyone with ready access to good stuff. Explained my operation, bitcoins, mining, and invited<br />the bank to come over. They told me it was not necessary but I need to open a business account. I contacted a lawyer who contacted them<br /><br />No business account needed =).
