				Hey, excuse me if I sound stupid here, but I&#039;m new to all this Bitcoin / SR business, and I was wondering if there&#039;s just a straightforward way of getting bitcoins into your wallet just through one online transaction... something that doesn&#039;t require going to your bank and crap.<br /><br />To be honest I don&#039;t have much of an idea what I&#039;m talking about, but I was expecting getting bitcoins to be an instant thing...

				Plenty of ways, few if any of which are anonymous and none of which are really worth the risk.<br /><br />The whole point of cash over the counter is that it is anonymous. Don&#039;t need to give a name, contact details, anything, just tell them this money goes to this account for....whatever your imagination can come up with. If they question it, &quot;I dunno, I&#039;m just running errands for a friend.&quot;<br /><br />Bank transfers, Paypal, credit card and the like all leave a paper trail. If your bitcoins are traced through the network to or from SR, your name will be on the other end of that trail. Game over.

				<br />Moneypack from Walmart or similar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give to reputable Silk Road Bitcoin vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Coin directly in SR wallet.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is a little higher percentage but usually fast and simple. <br /><br />Less steps involved. <br /><br />

				I explain what I&#039;ve done/plan to do. Being a beginner, please point out the holes...UK based solution.<br /><br />1. Signed up for Mt Gox account (using Hotspot Shield to change my IP address, it doesn&#039;t like Tor connections I believe). No real details required. <br />2. Went to Barclays and filled in a cash deposit slip with the Mt Gox details and put it in the quick drop slot (no cameras, apart the ones coming in the door).<br />3. Next day balance reflected in my Mt Gox account. <br />4. Bought bitcoins.<br /><br />The next steps are planned, not implemented, so guidance would be appreciated.<br />5. Transfer coins via bitcoinfog to my wallet on my PC.<br />6. Pick something nice on SR.<br />7. Transfer coins to SR via bitcoinfog and pay.<br />8. Enjoy...<br /><br />A question I have is whether it is necessary to transfer via bitcoinfog when transferring into SR, or if there&#039;s a better service out there that does a similar job?

I don&#039;t do anything with bank&#039;s involved, and never ever use PayPal (not only is it against their TOS and they&#039;ll most likely freeze both accounts, but it&#039;s super easy to trace, same goes with CC&#039;s). Either use bitinstant or a mp-to-btc vendor on here (only use reputable ones unless you want your money stolen :S)

				Hey there, a newbie myself and I have a similar problem. I want to look for some insight (especially Virtrex Exchange) on what I can do now.<br /><br />What I decided to use to pay for Bitcoins was with Canada&#039;s Virtrex and I decided to go through the bank and do a cash deposit. Now that I do have the cash in my account and reading this thread. is there no way to use those bitcoins no more since its traced to my account? I&#039;ll check out bitinstant for sure but I wanna know what I can do now.

Considering you can use a fake name, I would assume that you don&#039;t have to bring ID to prove you are 18. ;)<br />Otherwise, how could you stay anonymoose?<br /><br />No, It would not matter being just under the age of 18. <br /><br />Enjoy SR, brother. Stay Safe.
