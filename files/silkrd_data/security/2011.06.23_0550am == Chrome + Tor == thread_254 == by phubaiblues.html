				I ran across this during a google search.&nbsp; Reason is, I&#039;m trying to figure a way to use Tor in Chrome OS, which I got, and this was a start: sure seems a lot quicker than FF...anybody know if it&#039;s less--or more--safe?<br /><br />1. Download Vidalia from<br />http://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en<br />2. Install Vidalia - a TOR client with GUI.<br />3. Wait until Vidalia tells you that Tor is working.<br />4. Start Google Chrome.<br />5. Using the Tools menus (it looks like a wrench), choose options, &quot;Under the hood&quot;. Scroll down to &quot;Network&quot; and click the &quot;Change Proxy Setting&quot; button.<br />6. Under the &quot;Connections&quot; tab, choose &quot;LAN Setting&quot; - Select Use Proxy server and enter &quot;Localhost&quot; and port 8118.<br />7. Save your work and return to the Chrome web browser. Check that you are using TOR by going to<br />http://check.torproject.org/<br />A Green message will indicate that TOR is operating correctly. A Red message will indicate that TOR is not set up correctly.<br />8. Continue to surf using TOR<br /><br /><br />Read more: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_you_configure_Google_Chrome_to_use_TOR#ixzz1Q3oRgkT3

				You should really use FireFox+Torbutton. It does more than just enable Tor, it also does other security-related things to help keep you anonymous.

				Also, use a portable version of firefox+tor. Never every your customized everyday firefox, extensions for example may make your browsers fingerprint pretty unique.

				OK: I got part of this right: I have my FF tor browser, which I just use for transactions...but it was lagging so bad tonite, I finally switched back to the chrome set up thru tor, just to post in forums, and it was so much quicker.&nbsp; I also set up two different linux distros in virtualbox today, to compare them: ubuntu and slax, and slax is a lot quicker, and has a pretty cool tor module.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been messing with 2 different setups: Privatix and Tails.&nbsp; Chrome is just faster, but so far, I&#039;m convinced by what you guys posted: I appreciate the help...I just don&#039;t like VM&#039;s, no matter how I slice it up, they are a pain, and slow, and some distros--like Tails--seem to believe you are safer without them...<br /><br />I actually think buyers might have different concerns than sellers, in this matter, also...and whether you&#039;re most concerned about getting rid of physical evidence in a hurry, or more concerned about hiding browsing evidence.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tails is great, but more of pain, as no Data Persistence.&nbsp; I like Privatix best, as you can leave data/apps on flash drive encrypted...but very little english docs, and I&#039;m going to have to use ndiswrapper, or download the wireless card driver, and try to put together a module or something for that...also like Slax...(no wireless, naturally, another common problem with some of these light distros) ...
