				Anybody having transfer issues with them ? <br /><br />I made a transfer from my bank account to their bank account last monday, and nothing appears on my account yet. I mailed their support team and they just replied with a copy &amp; paste general answer saying they were experiencing delays with money transfers, disregarding the specifics of my inquiry.&nbsp; Now, I have no bitcoins and urgent needs for drugs. <br /><br />Seriously, I&#039;m thinking of closing my account there and open another somewhere....<br /><br />Any recommendations ? Is this exceptional for MtGox ? Has their customer service been always that shitty ?

				Their customer service is clueless, and I can&#039;t log in via Tor, so any communication with them has to be made over the clearnet (they log your IP, just so you know).&nbsp; I&#039;d say stay away from them if you can.&nbsp; I know they have a pretty low asking price for Bitcoins, but there&#039;s got to be a better place to do business.

				There&#039;s tradehill, which you can fund through using paxum however paxum requires you have to send in a bunch of photo proofs. <br />There&#039;s also Exchangebitcoins.com, I have an account with them but haven&#039;t used it yet. They are legit though. You can walk into one of their affiliated banks, deposit, and receive your funds within a day. Look under there &#039;quick cash, check deposit&#039; for more info.

				exchangebitcoins looks promising. but for those that wish to stay 100 percent anonymous or close to it might still have to go other routes. but I think it has promising potential...<br /><br />The main problem that I see with exchangenitcoins is that its so new and with all the scams that have already happened, I&#039;m not so sure that It will take them a while to gain trust, etc. After thinking about it, I am going to wait a while before I give them a try. their volume is quite low and the bitcoin market is too damned iffy... Ill stick with TH or MT. Gox for now.. Yes, even though its a pain. Even those other options that may charge a few points may be better, at least there are some that have been around for a few months. Exchangebtc is only a little more than a month old...

				MtGox= sucks! The graphs, the site itself. It just sucks. GOX-DWOLLA-BANK. Not as fast as it could be.<br /><br />Exchangebitcoins.com= Better. Awesome graphs, easy to understand. Super easy to get money out. And cheap too. $1 ach, cash in my account in 2 days tops. Exchangebitcoins.com -ACH-BANK. Faster than MTGox.--- Checks take about 2-3 days. That&#039;s fast for a check. <br /><br />Tradehill= sliding backwards. Domestic wire could take 2 days and cost $15+. No thanks. They used to be SAME DAY! A check... 5 business days or more. I am still waiting, it&#039;s been 6 business days and the weekends. UGH!! I used to be a huge fan, not so much anymore. When they get themselves together, I will be back. <br /><br />I have used all 3 extensively in the past 2 months.<br /><br />My recommendations: Exchangebitcoins. Tradehill. Money under the mattress. Then MtGox. <br />

				Definitely, will be using exchangeb more because their time for deposits are really reasonable compared to mtgox and I&#039;m not dealing with tradehill.<br />@chronicpain, thanks for the warning. I felt the same way but did a lot of reading/research on the official bitcoin forum and these guys have been around for awhile. Everybody on there only has good things to say but you never know, it shouldn&#039;t be so bad to just buy bitcoins and transfer out of there ASAP tho.

				i use mtgox and they always are quick to respond to questions and i found them very helpful.. its a tad slow transferring money.. they promise it will take 1 working day but i usually find it takes 3-5. I&#039;ve had no issues using them so far..

				I want to give a BIG shout-out to ExchB=exchangebitcoins.com.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used them extensively over the last week and they are very prompt on all aspects of buying and selling BTC, sending out checks, etc.&nbsp; The fact that their volume is so low is more a reflection of how scared people are of startups in the bitcoin economy than anything to do with them personally.&nbsp; I hope everyone who is on SR, buyers and sellers alike, will work with ExchB so they can have a profitable business and stick around for a while.&nbsp; They also show you their &quot;bid&quot; and &quot;ask&quot; order books so you can get the absolute best price for your BTC&#039;s.&nbsp; And the fees are very low.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even sent two small amounts out to people&#039;s account at other banks because they charge less than my bank for a wire transfer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both were received very promptly.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they get enough business to stay in business, I think theyre going to get bigger and make both Mt. Gox and TradeHill smell like the piles of doggie doo that they really are.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to ask support questions at both and never gotten either a prompt or proper answer.&nbsp; The whole BTC community NEEDS a really good exchanger and ExchB is looking like they could be the ONE.&nbsp; But only the oracle, McDdro knows for sure! ha!&nbsp; <br /><br />Hey, if they can get McDdro&#039;s seal of approval you know they must be good!&nbsp; Come on everyone, give these guys a chance.&nbsp; Oh, and before you ask: no, I don&#039;t have shares in ExchB nor do I know the people who own it.&nbsp; I&#039;m just a very satisfied customer. :D

				I have been using ALL 3 exchanges and clearly Exchangebitcoins.com is the best. I&#039;ve sent checks out, ach, and wire transfers. ALL were faster though exchangebitcoins. Low volume is a problem but as more people check them out I believe that will change for the better. ExchB&#039;s checks came 1 day faster on more than one occasion in different weeks vs Tradehill. Tradehill f*ded up my wire transfers more than once. Unacceptable! The ach took about the same. And Mt.Gox to Dwolla to end destination takes a few (3) days. Too long. ExchangeB is the way to go in my opinion. Let&#039;s get the volume up over there.&nbsp; ;D

				ExchB seems pretty anonymous to me.&nbsp; You can deposit cash to any WF or Chase drive thru and they don&#039;t ask for ID or sign.&nbsp; Neither does ExchB.&nbsp; Then just email them a receipt.&nbsp; It was pretty fast.&nbsp; This method totally rapes any WU garbage or bank account method.

				I&#039;ve used bitcoin4cash.com twice now. 1st was a test run, 2nd was a large amount. I figured I&#039;d try that as it would be the ultimate model for screwing me if that is what they were going to do.<br /><br />They didn&#039;t.<br /><br />I was getting a bit worried as the 2nd (large) transaction took 3x as long as the 1st (small) transaction. But it did finally come through.<br /><br />I use security envelopeS. I cut the edges off of a few security envelopes (so they just barely fit inside each other), put them inside each other with the money inside that, then the final envelope. Adds a little heft, can&#039;t see jack inside it when you hold it up to a light. Pop it in the mail, and begin the painful wait....<br /><br />100% anonymous. Makes you feel shaky, but they haven&#039;t boned me and easily could have. I may never have a reason to use them again, but I feel confident enough in this experience to use them as my go-to source for BTC. Anonymity is well worth it (my Bitcoin client uses TOR).

				I&#039;ve now been waiting on a dwolla&gt;gox transfer for over 24 hours.&nbsp; In that time I made a reservation for a cash deposit at a local branch, made the deposit, send the confirm e-mail, and had bitcoins in my exchangebitcoins account in under 2 hours.&nbsp; Still nothing from gox...<br /><br />What&#039;s going on with them?&nbsp; Just too much business for these guys to handle or what?&nbsp; After this last transfer is done, I&#039;m closing gox and dwolla for good and going with exchangebitcoins from now on.
