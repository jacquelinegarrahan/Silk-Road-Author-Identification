				Unless he was keeping outside records about addresses etc there should be fook all on his system. There is no real reason why he should have kept addresses, I mean who the fuck keeps extra evidence for 5-O to find? &quot;Yes Mr Gammon, you have caught me with a commercial quantity of a contraband substance. And now, because of this, as a well done present for being so clever, I&#039;ll make your life easier when it comes to convicting me by showing you who I have been flogging my commercial quantity of said contraband substance as well. Don&#039;t worry, the evidence is on me!&quot;<br /><br />Lol....unless you are a complete barnacle then you wouldn&#039;t do that shit.

				Chances are they may not even be aware of his SR connection. They might just have arrested him because he was busted with a bunch of weed or something, or one of his contacts talked.

				They have got their dealer... they dont care about people ordering on SR from him unless you were buying large quantities and dealing yourself. I have had alot of my dealers get raided IRL and found out the cops were watching when I was going to their house, but they never came after me or anyone else buying perso and I see this as the same.

Things like meth, you will do a decent lagging 5+ years for ounce or if in the kilo range you&#039;re gonna get double figures. On the other hand you could get charged for a bunch of ecstasy pills and a few sheets of lsd and walk away with a fine for few grand. <br /><br />In australia forget about getting a Perry Mason lawyer and beating charges, all the judges, prosecutors, lawyers, etc decide virtually everything behind closed doors amongst them self.

				Thanks for the heads up EtM and good advice.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also add that DBA had a notice on his weed page saying he didn&#039;t bother with disguising his product since it wasn&#039;t that important (or words to that effect), which reinforces Matrix&#039;s message - make security a priority and if your vendor doesn&#039;t ...don&#039;t use them.<br /><br />

				Anyone who thinks that Australia doesn&#039;t have decent sentencing laws should have a word to a guy I used to know, who did 18 months for a relatively low level amount of coke. They&#039;d been watching him for a while (actually watching the much bigger guys above mainly) and he got raided. Timing was all that stopped it being a much bigger bust. <br /><br />He didn&#039;t give anyone up (couldn&#039;t really, those above were apparently pretty smart/security conscious) and it saved him in prison. He&#039;s gone back home now and won&#039;t be visiting down under again.

I can guarantee other prisoners will find out, co-accused will put their name out, a screw who dosnt like them will put their name out, guys cleaning screws office look at other prisoners on the computers, etc etc. Heaps of people think they are the clever one who can hide and keep a secret in prison but they all end up with the utter shit kicked out of them, just like pedos and rapist that try and hide in mainstream.<br /><br />I am just saying being dog can only hurt you more than help you. Sure if you are busted, you can put your hand up and plead guilty, that might shave 1/3 off your sentence. But if you give up other people like a dog, you will not save yourself anytime and put your quality of life and well being in serious danger.<br /><br />
