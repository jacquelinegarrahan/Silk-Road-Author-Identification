				Just like it says Im tryign to find a bitcoin exchange were I can go to a bank make a deposit and it goes into my account. I used to use Mt gox but it appears that that is no longer an option.<br /><br />What about bitme.com anyone use that or know of that. It requires you to take a picture of the receipt that just seems shady I like how mt.gox was instant. <br /><br />Anyone else with any advice

				bitme.com or bitcopia<br /><br />Ive used bitme.com and was easy.&nbsp; Deposit at chase bank, get receipt.&nbsp; Take picture from phone, wipe exif data and then email to bitme.&nbsp; Money has showed up for me in my account on bitme within the hour after emailing receipt picture.&nbsp; Vouch for them.

				I used Bitcopia for the first time today (was fed up with the increasing fees for cash deposit using Bitinstant +Mt. Gox).&nbsp; I am very pleased with it.&nbsp; My coins came within ~30 mins and cost ~5% fee.&nbsp; I am unable to use some of the other exchanges which offer cash deposits at banks not available near me (Chase and Bank of America), so I highly recommend Bitcopia if you have access to a Wells Fargo bank!&nbsp; There is a $999/day limit and the exchange is only operating during USA business hours though.

				Depends where you are. In UK there&#039;s no exchanges I&#039;m aware of accepting UK cash payments. You could use bitcoin-otc or localbitcoins.com or tradebitcoins.com

				Since bitcoin is legal can&#039;t we use Bitcointalks.com than lauder it and fog it before using it? They have the best deals for bitcoins.

				So I guess im using blue sky traders or bitcopa. However in bitcopia they say you need to use real name and info is this true? also can you deposit your coins directly to SR wallet or should you still fog them and wallet em?

				I used bitme for my last two transactions, both went off without a hitch and were very quick (Had the funds in my account about 1-2 hours after sending the receipt the second time and a whopping 5 minutes after the first time). <br /><br /><br />Just remember to scrub the EXIF data from the picture.
