				My best guess would be not to deposit directly into a bank. Cash them a vendor that will cash them ie western union, check cashing store, even some grocery stores and corner markets will cash them. I would not cash them all at one and would go to different locations.<br /><br />I hope this points you in the right direction. Maybe&nbsp; someone else that knows more on this can give you a better answer.

				Are they in your name or are they for &#039;cash&#039;?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Do you wish to keep it &#039;hidden&#039; for tax purposes, or something else?<br /><br /><br />As a rule, unless you are being audited by the tax dept anything under $10,000 is not going to be &#039;noticed&#039; and you have no obligations to tell anyone about it<br /><br /><br />It really depends on just how &quot;dark&quot;&nbsp; you want to make it, ..... unless you HAVE TO &#039;justify&#039; the money to someone, I wouldn&#039;t worry<br /><br /><br />IME having banked similar amounts (oz) over the years without any &#039;issues&#039; tax or otherwise (with taxes having been paid before any money went into my account anyway....so I don&#039;t see how they can &#039;separate&#039; amounts deposited unless they actually single you out for an audit<br /><br />what&#039;s the issue with just cashing them OR putting them into your bank?<br /><br />&nbsp;
