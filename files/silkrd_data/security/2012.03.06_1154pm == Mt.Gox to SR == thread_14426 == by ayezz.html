				I dont know how safe it is but with instawallet down I just sent mine straight from mt.Gox to sr and didnt have any probs.&nbsp; only took about an hour to receive them in my account....I was a little nervous but just went ahead and did it...worked fine so far...nobody knocking on my door yet.

				Im still totally a noob at all this but instawallet was an ewallet that you could store your bitcoins in...I dont even really understand the point just that&nbsp; by using intawallet you didnt have to send bitcoins directly to sr from mt. gox.&nbsp; I think the main thing is to not access mt. gox through tor...thats when they flag you or wont do business with you or whatnot....like I said though...Im totally just learning..and very slowly at that.

				Moving bitcoins to the SR is not illegal so I don&#039;t see why you&#039;d be reported, even with a connection. I don&#039;t think they could connect them anyways...wallets are just wallets, I don&#039;t think there is anything special about SRs wallet that would make it stand out. If there is, seems like that would be a very stupid feature/idea.<br /><br />Instawallet is just that, an instant wallet online. You put funds in it and out of it and all you have is a link. If you lose the link, you lose connection to your wallet. After you&#039;ve used the wallet, forget the link (after ONLY accessing it with TOR) and the wallet is basically gone without as much of a trace.

				I never washed my bitcoins due to just being a personal consumer, but as I understand it, pretend 100 people have 5 BTC each. They split that up into 20 .25 increments. So two thousand .25 increments (might be much smaller) not sure. BTC are all swapped and switched, mixed up. Everyone leaves with the same amount they put in but instead of 5 BTC made up from one source, the 5BTC is from random&nbsp; .25 increments from everywhere and anywhere. Pretty impossible to track or at least to one specific source.<br /><br />Remember I cam a complete &#039;security/washing&#039; noob so I am not for sure if that is how it is done or if there are more details to it.

				Just don&#039;t sign on to your Mt. Gox account through Tor because it may&nbsp; freeze your account. Also, your Mt. Gox account should be set up with a name tied to a Tormail account. And it probably wouldn&#039;t hurt if you did the transfer to SR on someone else&#039;s (not a Starbucks where they may keep IP records) wi-fi, ie, from an unlocked wi-fi in an apartment complex.
