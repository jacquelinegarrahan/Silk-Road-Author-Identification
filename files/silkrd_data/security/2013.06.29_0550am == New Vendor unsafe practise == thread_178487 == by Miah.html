				Would it be wrong for me to call out a vendor with a totally unsafe practice of the handling of customers information? I tried to advise the vendor that what they&#039;re currently doing is both wrong and unsafe and was told that DPR himself told him that it was indeed safe and that he trusts DPR.

				How was your info used? Because if you feel like it exposed your identity, then yes it is a problem.<br /><br />Future customers will probably feel the same way if he doesn&#039;t change his technique.

				No I haven&#039;t bought from him. I don&#039;t wanna come out and say the name of the vendor cause I think that&#039;s just kinda wrong but I was interested in &#039;listing&#039; an item for him to sell for me. What he does once the item sells he gets the customers address then sends it to Privnote to encrypt and then sends it back to you. Like what?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />It makes no sense at all. We are on SR&#039;s site why expose the customers address by sending it to Privnote of all things and then sending it to me so I can ship out the item. Why not just send the address in a message through SR..and using privnote out of all things, ffs. If anyone wants to know the vendor you can message me. <br /><br />According to this vendor DPR assured him this was safe for small transactions. I think this vendor is very confused. I tried to offer advice and let him know what he&#039;s doing is exposing his customers and he seems ignorant of that fact.

				I wouldn&#039;t do business with him until he makes the changes necessary for you to be/feel safe.<br /><br />Id Send him another message explaining everything again to make it clear. If he still doesn&#039;t care/understand Id message someone with a little authority here or report him.

				I still can&#039;t believe he told me that he talked to DPR and DPR said it was ok, lol...wtf? IDK maybe he&#039;s LE? I hate to jump on the paranoid LE bandwagon but I have no other explanation. I did explain to him politely that his procedures were unneccessary and added risk to his customers and his whole business equation in which he was having none of it. <br /><br />I&#039;ll wait till more people comment on this thread and see what they think. I&#039;m 100% not for it though and would never deal with him that&#039;s for sure.

				That logic is seriously flawed.<br /><br />That&#039;s the equivalent of saying &#039;I&#039;ve stolen from this store many times, I&#039;ll never get caught&#039;. Besides the whole argument of whether or not Privnote is safe is not the main issue. The main issue is that it&#039;s a totally unnecessary step by the vendor that provides no real benefit besides the added exposure of the customer.<br /><br />&nbsp;Someone could always spoof the site to https://privnot.com/ and it show up in the search results. I&#039;m sure someone would use it. Sites can be hacked. Malicious code can be added. You get the point I think.

				There&#039;s some valid reasons people don&#039;t like privnote. Granted it may not have had a problem ... yet. If I sent my address encrypted with PGP, I would hope/expect that if it was a drop ship that the vendors would keep my information PGP encrypted as well (and not using something such as privnote).

				Hi SR´s!! Hi Miah!!<br /><br />You´re talking about &quot;...tree&quot;, I think.<br />That seems to be connected with &quot;graigslist&quot;, who was already mentioned as a scammer (don´t know the exactly thread).<br />I would never use a service like this, to many ways to a scam!<br /><br />Maybe you use BMR, there you need only 1 Btc and a PGP key for a vendor account - just an idea.<br /><br />Ps: Everybody can get the info at the vendor´s page!

				a vendor admited to me yesterday that they did not know how to use PGP &quot;or whatever we call&quot; and thought nothing of it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to explain the rick and ignorance in his attitude and have asked him if he was joking befor I expose him everywhere as that was about the sacrier things I&#039;ve heard here. <br />PGP is simple!&nbsp; also for newer users, most of us say PGP but are using GPG(GnuPrivacyGuard) the open source clone.<br /><br />two respected members just gave me some food for thought but if a vendor asks for privnote instead of PGP I find another vendor.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know much about it because PGP is the best, super simple to use, why use anything else?

				Miah the comment was aimed at Jack N Hoff.<br /><br />Aurelius Venport how is covering an ass of a lazy vendor snitching? Transmitting &quot;customers addresses over clearnet in cleartext using free clearnet email services&quot; is dangerous and dumb.<br /><br />But hey, let&#039;s all just shut up and let this practice continue because nobody wants to say a thing. I mean, that is what the community is about, right? A giant circle jerk.

I don&#039;t wanna come out and say the name of the vendor cause I think that&#039;s just kinda wrong but I was interested in &#039;listing&#039; an item for him to sell for me. What he does once the item sells he gets the customers address then sends it to Privnote to encrypt and then sends it back to you. Like what?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />It makes no sense at all. We are on SR&#039;s site why expose the customers address by sending it to Privnote of all things and then sending it to me so I can ship out the item. Why not just send the address in a message through SR..and using privnote out of all things, ffs. If anyone wants to know the vendor you can message me. <br /><br />According to this vendor DPR assured him this was safe for small transactions. I think this vendor is very confused. I tried to offer advice and let him know what he&#039;s doing is exposing his customers and he seems ignorant of that fact.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Shit like this pisses me off. If I went out of my way to protect my info by encrypting it myself, and some idiot dumped it on a third party site, I would be furious.<br /><br />This is a good think to know about a vendor. Ultimately I think they should be free to run their business however they want. If they don&#039;t accept PGP encrypted addresses, or they post the address on Privnote, or email the plaintext to their shipping associates, that&#039;s up to them, but I&#039;d like to know about it, so I can ensure I never buy from them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed. I would be very concerned if this was happening. There is no reason why the buyer can&#039;t encrypt the address with the actual seller&#039;s public key. The person in the middle should never know those details, it just puts people at greater risk.
