				This_is_not_SOCA is correct.&nbsp; Assume this forum is compromised.<br /><br />Assume it&#039;s going to ship you exploit code.<br /><br />Assume all private messages have been read.<br /><br />If someone has control over the hidden service node for SRF, *and* they have control over any entry guard nodes, they can deanonymize you.<br />

				Everyone should have been under the assumption that LE has been on these forums for quite some time now. Can&#039;t really confirm one way or the other but in any case why would you want any details that could lead them back to you out in the open?<br /><br />I&#039;ve even read a few posts from the extra paranoid that go as far as changing their lingo around in each post to sound as if they&#039;re from certain regions (based on local slang etc), or posting with grammatical errors to feign being a non-English speaker.<br /><br />A bit over the top IMO but the fact remains everyone should keep the details short. Don&#039;t make it any easier to hunt us down.

(I put my hand up now and say I don&#039;t know shit about SMF forum but this does look like it is related to the honey pot mod - MOD httpBL)<br /><br />** So either you ended up there as a result of some other action or it would suggest , perhaps, that the server config has changed or that - possibly this is actually a completely different server. I have noticed that, despite the load, it seems faster than it was a couple of days ago.... **<br /><br />Sorry to be so vague but that is certainly a bit odd and if what you say is accurate - would suggest that the server and/or config was changed

Even though stuff may have been deleted from the current server, it may still exist on a site backup. While we may know what DPR said/claimed, we have NO way of knowing what he actually DID. It is only prudent to assume that every message, every transaction, every address is now in the hands of law enforcement. For those who PGP-encrypted their communications, they have little to worry about, for the most part. Communications with DPR, even those encrypted with PGP, should now be considered compromised.&nbsp; If DPR was sloppy about his operational security, then it only stands to reason that he likely choose a poor PGP passphrase, which he may have given-up, or which may be subject to a dictionary attack/brute-forced. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=216806.msg1589668#msg1589668">Quote from: KarmaEnforcer on October 04, 2013, 04:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do any of the mods have knowledge if this process worked properly or not according to what the Wiki stated?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I doubt it.

From exchanges I&#039;ve had with former moderators, DPR is a hands-on control freak, he kept everyone on a very short leash. As such, he likely kept everything on his laptop. I&#039;ve also heard in at least one media report, that the Feds arranged for DPR to have &#039;an appointment&#039; with someone in chat, so that he would be guaranteed to be online, and logged-in to his various accounts, so the Feds could catch him with his pants around his ankles. Looks like their strategy worked. <br /><br />Frankly, you would be deluded if you didn&#039;t assume that the Feds go their paws on everything, including this Forum server. As such, everyone who did not encrypt their info are now waking up to the realization that their info is in the hands of the FBI.&nbsp; Even as late as last week, idiots like RxKing were saying to people that PGP would not protect them, and those who thought so were fools.&nbsp; The real fools are the people who didn&#039;t use it, which according to some estimates are upwards of 80-90% of people on here. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

And then they got the server a week ago. But they would not have the things in between those two dates if the info was gone from the server on the day it was seized?<br /><br />Do you think it would be possible LE would not have all of the SR servers? Would they know their location by know, and would they now be picking them up from around the world?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My take on this is that once the Feds got their paws on DPR&#039;s laptop, they got the whole enchilada. From exchanges I&#039;ve had with former moderators, DPR is a hands-on control freak, he kept everyone on a very short leash. As such, he likely kept everything on his laptop. I&#039;ve also heard in at least one media report, that the Feds arranged for DPR to have &#039;an appointment&#039; with someone in chat, so that he would be guaranteed to be online, and logged-in to his various accounts, so the Feds could catch him with his pants around his ankles. Looks like their strategy worked. <br /><br />Frankly, you would be deluded if you didn&#039;t assume that the Feds go their paws on everything, including this Forum server. As such, everyone who did not encrypt their info are now waking up to the realization that their info is in the hands of the FBI.&nbsp; Even as late as last week, idiots like RxKing were saying to people that PGP would not protect them, and those who thought so were fools.&nbsp; The real fools are the people who didn&#039;t use it, which according to some estimates are upwards of 80-90% of people on here. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I concur.&nbsp; This is the rational analysis of how it went down based upon what we know.<br /><br />But regarding the forums, we all know LE has been present from day 1 and hopefully have typed accordingly.

You can access this forum and read every thing written just as anyone else can do the same. <br /><br />Im saying this in public. <br /><br />Any one, journalist, some &#039;outback nazi law enforcement agent&#039; (Fear + Loathing), any government or public official can come on and read all our forum names, and all our comments. Its not a secret place we are whispering.

The only difference now is that there is a real probability of law enforcement control of the server; previously it was just a possibility.&nbsp; Any prudent person should have conducted themselves with the knowledge that anything said in the Forum is public, and also considered that any non-encrypted PM traffic may also be accessed/read/stored by other than the intended recipient(s). <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090 <br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />
