If you trigger an investigation they won&#039;t care how big or small the deposits are, they&#039;ll want to know where it&#039;s from. Generally if it&#039;s more than 50% of the average wage in your country, you shouldn&#039;t keep depositing cash like that and should get creative.<br />2) No, because what if they ask for proof? Then of course you have to change your story which is even more suspicious. Anyway, if you tell your tax agency that, there&#039;s a potential charge for tax evasion.<br />3) Not usually, it depends on what reasons you have for having the cash, but generally it isn&#039;t the quantity of bills you hand over but the total sum of them.<br /><br />However, I think you&#039;ve missed a major point. Creating 2-3 banks will not make you less suspicious as it is rarely the bank&#039;s own internal software which causes problems. Each transaction has to pass through a clearing house which is where the work-horse of software is scanning for unusual activity, who then pass the warning onto banks and sometimes your financial crimes specialists, depending on your region and how sure their are a crime is being committed. In short, it won&#039;t effect you having multiple banks, they all share information with the bigger agencies anyway who combine all that information.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />mo money. mo problems.&nbsp; Back to the drawing board....

That&#039;s all part of our wonderful KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations that all banks gladly follow.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163113.msg1158351#msg1158351">Quote from: tina on May 23, 2013, 05:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1) Does that amount to too much $$ deposited per month?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Maybe. If it were double that, then yes. The closer you get to the $10,000 reporting limit, the likelier you are to get flagged and the likelier you are to get charged with a heavy criminal penalty known as &quot;Structuring&quot;, which is the evasion of the reporting limit. You are truly fucked if that ever happens because you&#039;re presumed guilty until proven innocent.

If you don&#039;t have plausible deniability when push comes to shove, you&#039;re fucked again. Learn to assert your rights above all else if you don&#039;t know how to do so already. If ever questioned, DON&#039;T LIE TO THE POLICE. Keep your mouth shut, but don&#039;t lie. And don&#039;t write a lie down on paper either. That counts as fraud as well as obstruction of justice and also money laundering since you&#039;re dealing with cash. Lots of jail time for all those.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163113.msg1158351#msg1158351">Quote from: tina on May 23, 2013, 05:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3) Unfortunately, I have so many $20 bills.

If they are all in the same name they will all be considered together. Computers, internet etc make this harder than in the past. You need &quot;smurfs&quot; if you want to do that, but I would not recommend the smurf method.

				<br /><br />One thing you can do is start an LLC and claim to do free lance work. Keep tract of you&#039;re deposits and use turbo tax at the end of the year.&nbsp; So long as you meet you&#039;re tax burden no one will look into it. It would help if you really do make some real money from your LLC.<br />

				Doesnt matter on the amount 3-4k+ a week is fine. Get stupid things to come out of the account on a monthly basis. Magazine subscription, Worldvision (3rd world child sponsor) just stupid things that will come out on a monthly basis but nothing attached to your name. It will have a debit card so go and grab groceries with it, keep it simple, crack jokes at the bank with the tellers and they will start to know you.

				If you don&#039;t have plan for the money, please say you atleast have a solid exit strategy. the exit strategy comes before all things.<br /><br />As for your money problems you do as you wish but the Patriot Act allows for worldwide revenue recognition.<br /><br />Do some research online and their are ways to launder but you need to identify which one works for you safely.

				So, if you&#039;ll be offering a guide (either for sale or for public information) on SilkRoad what makes you think that the FATF will not manage to get their hands on the guide, rendering it useless, as you say? I think most of the techniques available as public info online are generally vague enough that even if the FATF did know about the techniques, they wouldn&#039;t be able to incriminate based upon that alone. Isn&#039;t that the purpose of a good way to launder you money? In a way which doesn&#039;t draw attention and is believable to authorities in case of an audit? The way I see it is that for people to successfully launder they need to build their own plan according to their personal factors such as amount of money being laundered, education, job, family, age, etc.. <br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ll be curious to see what you have to offer when the guide eventually comes out. Hopefully one day when I strike it rich I won&#039;t have to launder my money but just in case I do... well, knowledge is power.

				I agree with assiegear that StExo is good. It&#039;s not for small timers. If you&#039;re big enough to require professional services, then what they charge isn&#039;t much compared to the whole picture. You&#039;d probably loose more to taxes depending on where you are. These guys didn&#039;t learn to navigate laws and red tape overnight. Once you understand how the whole thing works you&#039;ll be amazed. Pure art and elegance.

People do it all the time, especially married couples. <br /><br />I have 3 acct currently active, a checking that me and my girl shares, and a separate checking and savings acct which funds are deposited every week like clock work. I won&#039;t share the amount but it&#039;s a good amount. Been doing this for 10yrs now without any trouble. Banks they want your money..They want you to deposit YOUR money so that they have something to play with...Only problem is there&#039;s always that one hero type character who just started working as a teller and want to make a name of him/herself by causing trouble, have to watch out for those types. Long as it&#039;s not different amounts deposited every week you should be alright. With the economy the way it is a lot of people do small jobs for a little cash as long as you don&#039;t go over board and start depositing a couple g&#039;s a week all of sudden. Just make sure you withdraw and make purchases to keep it active day by day and to also keep the balance from going to high to quick. Also, banks don&#039;t tend to snoop or care unless they are ordered too by LE or IRS...So keeping a low profile and nothing to make a teller go &quot; WOW!, that&#039;s a lot of cash&quot; One more thing, it all depends on the bank too. Smaller banks tend to get personal with their customers, just saying. And IF you just have THAT much cash, open a safety deposit box.<br /><br />People are probably going to disagree...But after doing this for 10yrs+ and have really close friends and family who all work at a major bank who all provided me with info and tips it works for me. Of course there&#039;s more to it..But, I won&#039;t go into that. Good luck and being overly paranoid can get you into more trouble than keeping you safe sometimes.

And what&#039;s the problem with paying some taxes? As far as I know, it&#039;s a great way to get anyone who would otherwise be snooping off your back. A good taxpayer is like a dream for the government. Even if you are doing something illegitimate they have less cause to care, because they get a good piece of it. Just keep your legitimate income middle class level and you&#039;ll stay in the 25-30% range. If you&#039;re an intelligent, resourceful dealer your profit margin is many times that. Pay your bills with the legitimate money and live humble.

				I think you misunderstood me P2P. The initial poster expressed no interest in paying taxes or laundering money except perhaps claiming to have a bartending job and wanted to open multiple bank accounts. Properly laundered money is an entirely different subject and freelancing without 1099s to back it up won&#039;t hold up if your caught. If your caught the first thing they do is seize your money then make you prove its legit meaning W2s, 1099, speaking with people who have hired you etc. If they can find your money and take it - they will do everything in their power to keep it.

The same goes if your pattern of banking activity is unusual compared to most businesses in your purported category. StExo is right: its a bad idea.
