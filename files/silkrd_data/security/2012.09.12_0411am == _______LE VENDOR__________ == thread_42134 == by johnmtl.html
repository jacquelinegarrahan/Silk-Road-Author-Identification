				I was just wondering if there was any security measures taken by SR to make sure vendors cant really be LE...<br /><br />I&#039;m not talking about small time vendors.. but big vendors with hundreds of transactions...is it possible that one of them can be LE.<br /><br />Does SR watch for&nbsp; new buyers all buying from one seller for example.. that would make me think that maybe it could be LE selling and creating accounts to fake transactions... <br /><br />So yeah..is there any way to really tell???<br /><br />there should be some sort of test involved to prove you are not LE..<br /><br />for example.. we can have like a list of &quot;qualified non LE inspectors&quot; and if a new vendor wants to sell he has to prove he is legit by sending samples of his product to different locations over the globe ( because LE can sell in there own country but cant ship drugs to an other country) once its proven that said seller is indeed legit only then can he/she start selling...<br /><br />I dont know but I think that an LE vendor with a lot of feedback is very dangerous to this community...<br /><br /><br />anyone care to chime in???? <br /><br /><br />

				The process is quite difficult to 100% identify LE vendors. First step is cross your fingers, and the second step is assume they ARE LE. It is hard to image LE selling hundreds of orders over months of work, but that doesn&#039;t mean they couldn&#039;t have been compromised. Just hope for the best, and look out for goofy shit like changed/removed pgp key, telling you to use privnote, accepting WU or CIM, referring to his team as detectives, asking to meet IRL, wearing a badge, the list goes on. Just be careful on the road so you don&#039;t get hit.

Unless large quantities, i tend to agree with you about LE staying away from international shipping.

				Law enforcement couldn&#039;t legally sell illegal drugs to people. so the only vendors that i would be worried about being law enforcement are sellers that dont sell any illegal items, such as vendors that only sell drug baggies and caffeine powder.

When I was a teenager, my weed dealer was busted over a long term sting where he was regularly being supplied by an under cover office, NOT a CI, but an officer. I was present for many of those deals, and I was there when the officer took the stand at his trial. Of course I cannot cite that either, but it was 20 years ago. When you post something of legitimate source here in this thread that states without a shadow of a doubt that undercover officers are legally bound to NOT sell drugs as part of their investigation, I will buy you a big old bag of your drug of choice!

				Cops can sell drugs of course !<br /><br />Bbut it is a lot harder selling them inernationaly.<br /><br />Hell will break loose for them :)<br /><br />(as long as they are not after a 1ton+ cocaine kingpin)<br /><br />

				Why incur all that liability when you can bust an actual vendor--many of which are weak links that would be trivial to locate--and flip them to work as a CI? Then you can legally be a vendor on SR by proxy AND have the bonus of snagging the target vendor&#039;s customer base.
