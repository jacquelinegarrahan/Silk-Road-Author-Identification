				&quot;AdamFreelance - how to access the silk road anonymous marketplace through tor &quot;<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFenRWPw0mo<br /><br /><br />Do you think this is ok? I found his email through his webite which he posts on his youtube account link (along with his phone numbers and address for some reason..I guess australia is very trusting?), and I sent him an email to please remove the video so that every little jerk off who wants to be cool and impress his friend...or every potential threat to silk road and this anonymous community, may have access and do as they please.<br /><br />All thanks to this kid spelling it out on youtube...<br />I mean, I&#039;m on the newer side of being a member, and BRAND new to the forum (I always read, have never posted or registered), but I put my time in and figured out how to set up TOR and get the link and blah blah...like a MAN on a MISSION lol. It&#039;s like initiation in my eyes: in order to have the privilege of using the site, you have to go through the research and reading and time it takes to access it, which isn&#039;t all that hard, but if you&#039;re not computer savvy you might give up just from the reading alone lo...if you feel the same way I do, please msg. this kid and tell him to buzz off!

				Not sure how I feel on step by step tutorials on how you use SR. If your not educated enough to figure it out from simply knowing the correct address, maybe you really shouldnt be on here..<br /><br />But you can&#039;t get much more detailed then this guys guide (including pictures of received packages, with partial intact addresses)<br /><br />http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road<br /><br />&nbsp;:o &gt;:(

				I had a compuiter savvy friend hook me up with silkroad, had no idea it existed before then! <br />I don&#039;t really care HOW you find SR, but I do think you should SHUT YOUR FAT FUCKING MOUTH ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!<br />People don&#039;t realise that just because LEO hasn&#039;t come for you yet, doesn&#039;t mean he wont! <br />You can&#039;t fully anonymously post on PooTube, so this cocksuckers days are numbered!

Public scene needs as many people as it can support buying and vending on it to further the movement, plus it&#039;s white noise for the rest of us. At the same time due to the media popularity of SR and all of the new public boards that&#039;ll be launched from their member base, USPIS/customs will have to get higher budgets and crack down sooner or later.

				If SR can&#039;t handle a little publicity it shouldn&#039;t be here. If we aren&#039;t confident it&#039;s secure, why are we using it?<br /><br />Silk Road has been on all the major tech blogs, been discussed in the U.S. Senate (Congress?
