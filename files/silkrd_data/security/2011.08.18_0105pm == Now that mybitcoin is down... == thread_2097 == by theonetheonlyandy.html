				Thats weird, the bitcoin wallet on my computer only takes about an hour to get 6 confirmations. Thats going through Tor as well. Is using an online wallet really that much faster? If I want, when I get 1 confirmation I can start moving it to where i want. The longest its ever taken was about 5 hours and that was because Mt. Gox was having issues that day..But on average, it&#039;s only 1 hour to xfer bitcoin from one place to another.<br /><br />Granted, you have to set up your client to pay .0005 bitcoins per transaction when you want to go through the socks4 proxy (Tor) which is like 1/2 a cent (if I did the math right). They recommend .01 bitcoins for faster service, but the .0005 seems to be working just fine. Every once in a while, I can get 6 confirmations in half an hour, but thats an exception, not the rule.<br /><br />Granted, the above is what I would do if I didn&#039;t have my &quot;secret&quot; way of doing things.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s important to have your own way of doing whatever and then keeping said way to yourself..

				A Virtual Machine with a second wallet can be used as an intermediate between sites.

				Hit the nail on the head Rake. With VB&nbsp; you can have windows, mac, linux so, right there you can have 3 wallets. A little over kill but, its much safer than putting trust on an online wallet.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t we learn our lesson&nbsp; yet?

Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but /where/ you store, send, and receive your bitcoins has no effect on how long it takes. It&#039;s dependent upon the Bitcoin network.
