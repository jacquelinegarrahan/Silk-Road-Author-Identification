				I got money held up for months recently in Blockchain wallet and went thru bloody hell to get it back-and not from someone at Blockchain mind you... I tracked down a wonderful person who doesn&#039;t even work with blockchain but knows Ben the guy who runs Block chain and says he is running it by himself and needs to hire people because he&#039;s in over his head. Blockchain has a TON of complaints about not being able to log into their accts or money tied up... etc. I got lucky. This guy doesn&#039;t want his name or email given out-since he is busy with his job of course. ANYWAY my point is I now refuse to EVER put a dime back into blockchain in fear of this happening to me again. So I now need a new method-a new place to transfer my money to from Mt Gox. I have used Bitcoin Fog before but they take HOURS and send it in bits-not all at once... Anyone have any good recommendations please?

				You know-I really don&#039;t know. When I first started here I was told the method was: 1. Bitinstant 2. Bitinstant to Mt. Gox acct. to buy bitcoin. 3. Mt. Gox to Blockchain wallet. 4. Blockchain wallet to my SR acct. So I&#039;m guessing maybe to keep it harder to track? Not sure-it&#039;s just the way I was taught and now that&#039;s even screwed cause I just discovered Bitinstant is down-they are revamping their website so now I got to figure out a new way of buying bitcoin. Good Lord it&#039;s ALWAYS something...

				Mt. Gox and Bitinstant are fucking dead as... dead. Localbitcoins, it&#039;s coming back in a big fucking way.<br /><br />Dozens of &quot;local&quot; bitcoin vendors accept cash deposits made anywhere in the country. Give it a whirl.

				Bitcoinfog = hours... <br /><br />Blockchain = months...<br /><br />Does not compute! Anyway, you select what time period you want. And they do send in several random amounts. That&#039;s good for security. And they mix the coins thoroughly, the more mixed as the longer you leave them in there. <br /><br />It&#039;s a veritable no-brainer.
