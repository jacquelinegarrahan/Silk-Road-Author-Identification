				I&#039;ve been arrested for an armed robbery, I&#039;ve been released on bail and I&#039;m due to appear before court in 2 months time. I&#039;d just like to know is it possible to leave the country during this time? I&#039;m Australian.

				I doubt if your going to find many people on here who know Australian Law well enough to advise you.<br /><br />I highly doubt if you&#039;ll be able to leave the country.&nbsp; If they didn&#039;t confiscate your passport chances are you&#039;ve been tagged on the computers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get a lawyer!

				If aus law is anything like British law (which I believe it is to some extent) then as long as there were no bail conditions clearly stating that you cannot leave then you should be able to go. It is specific bail conditions on a case by case basis that determines restrictions to the individual rather than a blanket law. <br />Oh and if you do leave there is still a very high chance you will get caught and returned to oz. Imho you should face up to it because you&#039;ll most likely just spend time away and return to spend time in prison. Seems a bit pointless really. Get a good lawyer, ask them to find any issues of contention regarding the evidence and to argue your innocence to the teeth. Either that or man up and do some time.

				What you should have done, and I&#039;m not sure if this pertains to Australian law as it would in my country, is try to strike a plea bargain instead of going to trial.&nbsp; In my country if you go to trial the prosecution will &quot;take you to the box&quot; and gun for the maximum sentence as punishment for wasting the taxpayers time and money on a trial.&nbsp; If you agree to plead guilty, they will usually offer you a lesser charge or reduced sentence.&nbsp; If you flee and become a fugitive you will be looking over your shoulder your entire life.&nbsp; When you finally DO come to trial you will be convicted for sure because the jury will see your fleeing as a sign of guilt.<br /><br />Use the next month to talk to your lawyer or public defender if you have one.

Do not cheap out here. <br /><br />I would also look at the conditions of your bail. Most bail is subject to conditions such as the forfeiting of your passport or staying within a specified jurisdiction and/or reporting to police. It is my personal recommendation to you - even if you are not prohibited from travel outside the relevant state jurisdiction, it will do NOTHING in your favour in court if you choose to travel overseas. You would potentially be doing yourself a LOT of harm in that regard.<br /><br />Armed robbery (whether an accessory or not) is a very serious offence and often results in a lengthy custodial sentence. I&#039;m sure that you are aware of this fact.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
