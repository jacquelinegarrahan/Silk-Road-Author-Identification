				bought some coins from spendbitcoins.com and sent them to coinapult wallet address. Have received spendbitocins email confirming that payment was received and bitcoins were to to coinapult wallet. Now every other time I have done this I have received and email from my coin provider and then coinapult within a minute of each other to get my coins. However this time after 6 hours I am still yet to receive the email containing the link to my coins from coinapult.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already sent a support ticket to coinapult but am yet to hear back from them.<br /><br />p.s. I have also checked the blockchain and it states that they have been sent.<br /><br />All help is appreciated

				Sounds like you have just had the same problem i&#039;ve just had. Yeah spendbitcoins are great and fast. I&#039;ve used them twice now, and no worries.<br /><br />But now, just when i&#039;m about to make my first overseas order, nothing for 24hrs. Its weird, i&#039;m new to all this, but i&#039;ve been reading alot of other posts about bitcoin providers, etc.<br />Trying to find the best way to do it, and cheapest place for BT&#039;s..hope they go through soon for ya mate. :)

				thanks mate. One thing I have realise is that IO may have mispelt my email address when getting the wallet address from coinapult :S So I&#039;m guessing that if it&#039;s an incorrect email address that I have typed it should bounce back to coinapult as undelivered am I right? Unless someone has the email address which I incorrectly typed in but I doubt that very very much.<br /><br />Do you think this is what should happen?
