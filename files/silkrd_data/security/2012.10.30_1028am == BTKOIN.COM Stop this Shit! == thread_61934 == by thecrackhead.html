				This is starting to annoy the shit out of me. There are 3 pages of spam at any given time by these fucktards.<br /><br />I know the problem has been raised before and I guess nobody took action, I know MODs are trying their best to stop the spam but for sure they don&#039;t like it!<br /><br />So what are the options?<br /><br />1) Keep reporting their paypal account!(which I personally did I even asked some of my friends to do it)<br /><br />2) We could raise a small amount of BTC and pay one of the guys at hackBB to take down the website on regular basis. Very reliable guys and they have a interesting escrow system the only problem with this is that I guess it will be quite easy for them to restore the website as I guess they have some sort of back up.(I am not a hacker so I don&#039;t know how this stuff works but they should)<br /><br />3) Pay a small amount of BTC&nbsp; monthly in order to be able to post on the forum. Leave it free for guests as it&#039;s kind of hard for noobs to find their way.<br /><br />It&#039;s an amazing community and it kind of like hurts to see all this spam bullshit. Personally I would punch the shit out of the spastic that keeps posting these topics.<br /><br />Discuss and try to do something about it, at least report the paypal account.<br /><br />One Love!

				I agree. It&#039;s really getting out of hand. Maybe reporting the PP account is a good idea. I like the idea of having to pay a small fee (0.01 BTC maybe?) a month to post, that would probably almost completely wipe it out, but as you said, it would make it even harder on noobs who are just trying to figure out a simple step in completing an order, etc.

				I;m not an expert but also not a noob on messageboards and mysql. But I&#039;m thinking the admins could block out certain words, for example: btkoin.com<br /><br />Or apply other rules that make certain topic titles impossible. But that should be done wisely otherwise it would hurt others as well.<br /><br />All of these things are just temporary measures. They will always keep spamming, change domains, names, email addresses etc.<br /><br />Most annoying thing is the PM thing. When I see a new message I get exited. Then it turns out to be spam :(<br /><br />Hope this will end soon. Thumbs up for making this thread for giving advice to people how to annoy them back.&nbsp; 8)

				I have experience with simplemachines forums, it is very simple to block keywords. <br /><br />It&#039;s unlikely they will keep registering new domains to continue spamming. Too effort and cost.<br /><br />It&#039;s confusing why the admins don&#039;t do this, although they have expressed that they have been extremely busy recently.

				Hah, I just created a topic about the exact same thing and how the spam pushes useful threads (such as this) into obscurity - and guess why? Too much spam so I couldn&#039;t see this one! :P <br /><br />I don&#039;t see why they couldn&#039;t just implement a captcha system - there&#039;s already one for the main site so why not here? Hopefully it&#039;ll prevent spam at the very least...<br /><br />Although on another note, I think a small payment is a great idea; not only would it prevent spammers/trolls like this, but hopefully it would discourage LEO... or at the very least, it forces them to invest some money in the very operation they&#039;re trying to shut down! ;D<br /><br />The recent spam has honestly got me somewhat concerned that the site may be compromised, particularly with more and more media coverage regarding it. I&#039;m all in favour of making the board somewhat private if that&#039;s at all possible, and I think monthly BTC payment may be a good way to do that.

				I seriously think it is not a very effective way to avoid spammers of feds to keep coming to SR. <br /><br />SR will definitely lose people if they would implement such a thing. Fees are high enough as they are already. <br />Some simple programming can prevent a lot of spam.

The domain registrar is then supposed to contact the domain registrant and have them confirm their identities and update their contact information. If the domain registrant doesn&#039;t do this within a certain amount of time (usually about 15 days), the domain registrar is then supposed to lock their domain, making their website inaccessible.<br /><br />Since they&#039;re registered with Melbourne IT, you can send an email complaining about inaccurate whois info to: abuse@melbourneit.com.au (source: http://www.melbourneit.com.au/contacts/index/).<br /><br />Be aware that they may require personal info about yourself (name, email address &amp; phone number) to actually do anything about your inaccurate whois complaint.<br /><br />So, if you&#039;re willing to share that information (should be fine as they have no way to trace you back to this forum), you could potentially get this domain taken down, or at least investigated and on their registrar&#039;s radar.

				Also, I haven&#039;t actually visited this website, but I imagine there is some sort of fraud going on. So you can mention that suspicion to the abuse team for their registrar as well. This may help speed up an investigation.

I&#039;m an average-semi-expert. But I&#039;m assuming they do not want my help, since all I get is criticism or even PMs in all CAPS.<br />Which makes me think that some mods are not good. nomad for example. He sells info from 1 year SR experience. Why the hell would you ask money for that? I&#039;d happily share it for free.<br />He acted retardedly though. I wasn&#039;t allowed to use SPAM while reporting a topic that should be removed by a mod. It was spam, but I didn&#039;t report spamming, just that all those topics should be removed.<br /><br />I can only help if an admin gives me certain rights. And I expect not getting such privileges since I&#039;m not even a well respected forum member.<br /><br />A very simple think would be to implement Captcha. Use that for logging in reduces spam a bit. Using it to post reduces it more. But that would be pretty annoying for forum members. And I&#039;ve seen more and more Captcha&#039;s that I can not understand as a human being.<br />Spambots become more capable every day.<br /><br />Another thing that would help, would recruit more mods. I would love to be one on SR since this is one of my favorite fora.<br />But I don&#039;t know where/how to apply, or what the requirements are.<br />I&#039;m online a lot and could delete spam topics way faster than is currently happening.<br /><br />@Squid...<br />I have thought about doing so. It doesn&#039;t matter if I need to give real information since they can not trace me back to this forum.<br />But the thing is that they actually CAN get new domains for very cheap. I know of a place where you can get a domain for just 2.8 euro&#039;s (maybe even less, cant remember now). For one year. <br />That&#039;s probably nothing compared to what they gain by spending money on it. I&#039;m a 100% sure people fall for those scam sites. Even one person would make a second domain name possible.<br /><br />I&#039;m confused as to why there are not so many mods. Mods could even be paid for being mods, considering how much SR makes every day. Probably thousands of dollars each month. Maybe even in one day.<br /><br />This makes me sad, because the initial intention was to provide a secure way to buy and sell high quality drugs for low prices. Something I&#039;m still completely for.<br /><br />I&#039;m even thinking of setting up some sort of mirror SR forum without spammers. But I don&#039;t think that would be very nice of me.<br />Then again, SR is also a copy of other sites...<br /><br />If somebody reads this and wants me to be a mod, you can help me out if you want. Perhaps somebody could make a poll or something.<br />Although being a good mod takes a lot of time and effort and I also have an actual life :p<br />But it would be very simple to log in and delete spam posts asap. <br /><br />Then again, I dont care so much. Nobody except for 2 persons are willing to give me donations for becoming a vendor and letting me have the opportunity to get such an experience. So my need to help others decreases by the day. <br /><br />Guess it&#039;s up to the mods and the anti spam man to do more work if they dont want more mods. And to the users to wait longer/search better and accept not very nice replies by mods or other users that there already is a thread about the same thing, or that you should use the search function (which for me doesn&#039;t work a lot of times because it tells me I already did a search 5 seconds ago, which I did not, lol).<br /><br /><br />
