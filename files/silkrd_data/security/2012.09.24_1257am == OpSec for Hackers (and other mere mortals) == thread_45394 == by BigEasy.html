				If you want people to read it, you&#039;re going to have to upload it some place my friend.<br /><br />Nobody should be using clearnet to view a link posted on SR, and nobody should be enabling things like flash/java/javascript etc in order to do so with Tor. Poor OpSec!<br /><br />Hence...<br /><br />The best thing is to convert it to HTML, images or something else that doesn&#039;t involve execution of scripts. Because otherwise to be properly secure people have to use my VM tutorial in order to securely open pdf and other files. It&#039;s not actually difficult, but I&#039;m not sure whether enough people are doing this.<br /><br />

Unfortunately I have yet to find a copy to download yet, anyone know of any easy way to convert that type of slideshow to html?<br /><br /><br />+1 for my -1 - thx

No, there was a hack but now it looks more involved such that you&#039;d need to be using 3rd party software, so it may not be worth the trouble. I read the transcript, and appreciate what the author was saying about mentioning geo specific factoids. It always makes me facepalm when posters on here are all &quot;good morning!&quot; or &quot;listen to my songs on youtube!&quot;. Ugh. Post your social security while you&#039;re at it. Maybe other people should read that too, but you know to be honest there is a severe comprehension problem for some people on here, they don&#039;t even so much as venture into the Security subforum. They think we&#039;re a bunch of whackos getting in the way of them sharing their holiday snaps from facebook or something.<br /><br />So, the real problem is not finding good sources of information, but finding a way to make more people read about it and take it seriously. You can&#039;t be a freerider when it comes to your security in general, you can&#039;t outsource that shit to everybody else. Or you can, but then more knowledgeable members of the forum start making jokes about bears, lions and running velocities.<br /><br />And I didn&#039;t give you a negative karma, I think you said you gave me a -karma and then a +karma to balance it out, but not sure.<br /><br />To be honest, I lose respect for any creator of a lulzsec document who then goes and posts it on slideshare with download disabled. What kind of bullshit move is that? Makes me suspicious of their intentions. Maybe they are really LE agents hoping to snag some lulzsec people by making them use clearnet.<br /><br />-- happy thoughts

				Thanks for your comments. I do understand the trouble trying to get some people to understand how important security is. I suppose it culls the weak...<br /><br />The slides have some really good information in them, I&#039;ll try and find a way to convert them.<br /><br /><br />I thought you had given me the minus 1, I just got, I thought wrong.<br />I did give you a +1 for the good advice.
