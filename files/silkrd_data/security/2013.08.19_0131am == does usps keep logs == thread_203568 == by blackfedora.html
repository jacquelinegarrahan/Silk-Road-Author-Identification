				I remember hearing they sometimes use cameras and some software to scan the address and handwriting.&nbsp; I&#039;d bet money that they take photos at least of each label / address area, and I don&#039;t believe for a second that they only keep those photos &quot;for 30 days&quot;.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier the US Government is pushing hard to track its subjects and gather as much information as is possible.&nbsp; Some people don&#039;t think this is a big idea but more and more groups are becoming &quot;enemies of the state&quot;, and drug buyers / sellers are near the top of that shit list.

				I know that USPS does take photos of postal items, I doubt they take pictures of every single piece of mail, but I would bet that they definitely take pictures of every priority and express mail.<br /><br />Use different drop off LOCATIONS, use different drop-off boxes at those locations, and switch the return addresses to match the general area of that specific drop off location (city). Change the style of your labels too...different fonts etc. Blend in!

				From my understanding, they take pictures, delete the pictures but keep the metadata.<br /><br />If they do that in the US, they probably do the same in other (most?) parts of the world...<br /><br />

				USPS not only takes photos but all packages address labels are scanned by the computer. Unreadable addresses such as handwritten ones have to be manually entered, I believe. Now it would only make sense to reason that if these addresses are being scanned into the computer, then why would they not store them? Just a fine lines of data.....They could probably store records of all mail sent, receieved, and tracked, only a small removable harddrive. <br /><br />Now whether or not this data will/has been used in any cases is questionable. Terrorist cases I could see it being used. The fact is the US Government has a LOT of resources at their disposal. They could infact bust every single one of you right now if they really wanted to. Whether or not they are willing to commit the time or the man-power into such a thing is another question all together. If the govt wanted to they could catch every single criminal on the streets at this very moment. They have technology that can detect drugs/illegal substances based on the molecular density of it from up to 100 yards away. I believe they have such devices in use at certain parts of the border, whether or not it is effective is another story. <br />

				The USPS is required to follow the same due course of the law as anyone else. They don&#039;t have the FBI monitoring messages, if you notice even the recent news about the attempts to deliver ricin had to first be discovered by the USPS and the authorities notified.<br /><br />That being said, this is 2013. It&#039;s naive to believe that the information isnt collected and stored. If it has a tracking number, it has to be stored, as does the address, and other information... it has to be, so that it can be tracked. The question should never be &quot;do they store this&quot; because the answer is almost always an absolute yes. The question should always be &quot;how important is this, and is that importance driving the need to direct funds towards it.&quot; The answer to that one, is usually no... especially since budget cuts have been going on for the past decade. They store the information. They don&#039;t repeatedly reference it. That would take an effort that simply isn&#039;t reasonable, without suspicion to do so. The NSA has the power, and funding, but they don&#039;t care about you.<br /><br />It is sometimes good to be paranoid, and it is always good to be diligent and to pay attention... be meticulous about what you do and how you do it. However, its also good to have an appropriate frame of mind. The NSA catalogues emails and phone and other forms of digital text. That, is what they are concerned with. The USPS is the part of the government that everyone considers the old man - it&#039;s there but it&#039;s not paid attention to, its occasionally visited by the grandchildren but otherwise it&#039;s left to pass away in relative peace.
