				I saw a quote from the CEO or CO or whatever the guy is saying it would be two weeks.&nbsp; Last weekend he was saying it would be Monday.&nbsp; Personally I don&#039;t think they have a clue when it&#039;s gonna be yet, but they have to say something... just saying don&#039;t get your hopes up.&nbsp; I&#039;m betting it won&#039;t be back thursday.

				Here&#039;s the actual quote from Bitinstant CEO. It is pretty vague, though.<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120749.msg1305486#msg1305486

				We wanted to provide a quick update to our users and the community regarding BitInstant’s inbound and outbound payment methods, which have recently changed.<br /><br />What changed?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Cash deposits via banks has been suspended<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Payout to Bitcoin and email addresses (via Coinapult) has been suspended<br /><br /><br />The cash deposits to banks have been suspended as we’ve had a number of problems with our partner.<br />Until these problems are resolved, we won’t be accepting the cash deposits at banks.<br /><br />It’s always been our intention to diversify away from the banks, regardless. Indeed, cash deposits are<br />still available via our non-bank retail locations (Walmart, 7-Eleven, CVS, etc.). Further, we are very close<br />to adding a host of new payment locations (non-bank) and some very exciting new payment methods<br />that are far superior to the bank deposits.<br /><br />Regarding the removal of the payment option to Bitcoin and email addresses (via Coinapult), we know<br />this is highly inconvenient for many of you. Coinapult is currently building a new, far more advanced<br />system which acquires and sends coins out to customers, and when this is done, the feature will be<br />back.<br /><br />Additionally, this will mean better prices for BTC conversion, faster transactions, and a more diversified<br />exchange environment (less reliance on one single exchange).<br /><br />So, please bear with us during these growing pains over the next week or two.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />-----<br />+ For cash deposits, you need to use the retail locations (not the banks) for now<br />+ Coinapult features (pay to email or Bitcoin address) will be back in a week or two<br />+ Exciting new payment methods are imminent (more cash locations plus something even more special)<br />+ When Coinapult is back, exchange rates will be better, with less reliance on one exchange<br /><br />Thanks!<br />-The BitInstant Team
