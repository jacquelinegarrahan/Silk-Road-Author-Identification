				Hi all/ SR admins,<br /><br />I got this email today and I&#039;m now concerned. I did everything right as usual, he confirmed my order and said he had everything, then I get this, asking me to send more money to another address. Obvously something fishy. <br />Someone please explain this to me. Thanks. Here&#039;s a copy of the msg I got:<br />The vendors account is Star2349jj.<br />Seems like a good guy. Great feedback etc...<br /><br />Hi Schrady,<br /><br />As you may already know Silk Road is having some security problems: Please send your payment to this address and I will cancel your order to create a refund for the payment you already made.<br />Send payment to this BTC addy: 1N1pj8KygcJv7UMByZrMkQW8uiGdPoQLHs<br /><br />Here is the link to the thread about the security breach on the forum: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?PHPSESSID=8kih6nj531eos3k0r1sibc5t43&amp;topic=11006.msg103167#new<br /><br />Your order is bundled and ready to go but I need you to send me your shipping address.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Star

				I&#039;ll look into this. DO NOT SEND MONEY. There is no reason you should ever send coins to an outside address. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				The link that you posted is from a thread started earlier today. Its only a glitch in SR bitcoin system. Like Digital said, Dont resend anything. Either hes scamming or is overly paranoid about the glitch. I think hes using the glitch for a scam cover..

				Exactly what first came to mind. I can&#039;t imagine why a vendor would msg you asking for a double payment.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure SR will take care of it though. They have an excellent reputation for taking care of members. Right now I&#039;m out 50 btc, but I&#039;m sure SR will make it right or I&#039;ll get my order.<br /><br />~Schrady

				No money has been taken out of his account. Remember folks never send money out of escrow, and if you purchasing from a new Vendor (or even just one your unfamiliar with) never finalize early! Doing this means we can&#039;t help recover the coin should something go awry.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Thanks DigitalAlch,<br /><br />I know about the escrow thing, but I am relatively new here and he had been a member with a 100 rating for 7 months. I&#039;ve spent almost 5k here w/o ever having an issue. <br />I hope we can all work this out. He&#039;s saying right now his btc&#039;s are gone and he doesn&#039;t have my money, and I don&#039;t have it. I&#039;m sure it will turn up in someone&#039;s account when this gets sorted out.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help!!<br /><br />Schrady
