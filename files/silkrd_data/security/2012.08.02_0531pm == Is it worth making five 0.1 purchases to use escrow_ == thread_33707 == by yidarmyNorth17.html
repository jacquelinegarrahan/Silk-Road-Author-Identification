				Hi All,<br /><br />gonna be making my first purchase next week, and been reading the anonymous sticky guide.<br /><br />From what i can gather, first time buyers have a difficult decision to make with regards to FE, as it seems all vendors ask for it from newbies.<br /><br />My question really is, if i buy say five 0.1 ebooks or something, will all vendors let me use escrow, or do those five purchases have to show a certain amount spent/use of similar vendors?<br /><br />Thanx

				All vendors don&#039;t ask for FE, even with new members :)<br />Vendors can see your purchasing stats when you place an order so buying low value ebooks doesn&#039;t work, better to shop around till you find a vendor that will give you a chance.

				There are plenty of vendors who will trust a first time buyer, and those who won&#039;t will see your buyer stats and realize you made &quot;fake&quot; purchases to up your purchasing stats and they&#039;ll probably still deny you. I&#039;d suggest making some smaller purchases with vendors who accept first time buyers. I know a shroom vendor who does this, several H vendors, and plenty of cannabis vendors do it as well because there are so many of them they can&#039;t all ask new buyers to finalize early; not requiring it will encourage buyers to choose them over other vendors.

				If you do this vendors will notice it and not like it. If I notice it I will refuse to serve you.
