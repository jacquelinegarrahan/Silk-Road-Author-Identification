				Hey everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m literally only hours-old to the world of Tor and Silk Road, so please bear with me.<br /><br />I wanted to purchase a fake ID, it is essentially a necessity at the school I&#039;m at because most of the social scene is at bars and night clubs. I was originally going to order one from ID Chief like many of my friends did, but I didn&#039;t get around to it before it was shutdown so after some searching I ended up here.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind paying up to $200 for the best ID you can buy. I&#039;m obviously not going to be stupid and try to use it for travel or anything but I just to get into bars and make the occasional purchase at a beer distributor or spirits store. I&#039;m going to be splitting my time between DC and PA, two places with extremely stringent alcohol laws so it needs to be a good fake (especially since in PA you can only buy spirits at the state-run stores).<br /><br />I just had a few questions though:<br />1) What state? I liked the Illinois one because its not close enough to where I live that it would be seen all the time, and I&#039;ve only lived in the East so I feel like I would have an easier time answering questions about Illinois as opposed to California or Arizona .<br />2) Would it be stupid to have the ID shipped to my dorm?<br />3) What is the best way to buy bitcoins?<br />4) Any other general tips, especially about maintaining security?

				Learn how to use PGP first so you can encrypt your address and personal information when messaging a vendor. In the search box type Pine and&nbsp; you will see many of his threads on how to use this. He is also more than happy to answer questions if you can&#039;t figure it out.<br /><br />I would get a P.O. box to ship it to. Just because I have been to a lot of dorms and mail gets misplaced very easily. It is a fake I.D. so a P.O. box is perfect. <br /><br />Bitinstant is a popular place to get bitcoins. You can use Moneypak exchangers on SR just research who you are giving your money to before you do the exchange. Some charge basically no fee and others are over 15% commission. Research and feel comfortable you know that you are making an educated decision. A lot of new people are in too much of a hurry and lazy to read only to find out that they got their money stolen and have to wait 10x longer than they would of if they researched for a few hours. <br /><br />I have heard California and New York I.D.&#039;s were the better looking ones, but I don&#039;t remember which vendor. They must be easier to make them look like the originals than some other states is my guess.<br /><br />I would advise using your fake I.D. at places where you have a better chance of the bouncer not caring. So, ideally not at the hottest club in town. Liquor stores in the low income areas aren&#039;t going to hassle you about it where as in snob hill people tend to think they have to be super cop. Nicer establishments are targeted more often by excise so they are more stringent where as a smaller club just wants you in there to buy drinks, so they don&#039;t care as long as it says 21 and looks close enough.

				The two posters above me offer good information and you&#039;d do well to read up and do your research carefully.<br />A fake ID may not attract as much attention as drugs might, but who knows, maybe you&#039;ll want to buy something else in the future, so I&#039;d advise you work on getting secure. (Learning PGP, stuff like that).<br /><br />I can&#039;t advise you too much on which state is best. My friend has a Maryland fake, and it&#039;s worked for him, but past that I don&#039;t really have too much experience here.<br /><br />I just wanted to say something on who you&#039;d be buying from. Of course, always ask for pictures of previous work by the person in question.<br />Don&#039;t limit your search to SR, HackBB (clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion) has some pros too, who know a lot about identities.<br /><br />Good Luck!

				Ok thank you guys for all the help! I&#039;ve been reading through that thread and trying to get myself setup securely. Is there any easy way to make Liberte work on a Mac, or would booting from the USB still work?<br /><br />And yeah I&#039;m just taking my time and doing my research. It seems like using BitInstant and Mt.Gox would be hassle-free so I&#039;m just planning on doing that. I really just need to decide on what ID to buy (I made a thread in the appropriate forum and I&#039;m just reading every bit of feedback I can find).<br /><br />Thanks again guys!

				I&#039;m not sure you can make Liberte work on a mac, frankly, but I&#039;ll keep trying. I&#039;m definitely no expert, but my attempts always stall with it &quot;waiting for media&quot; and it keeps waiting for a long time. You might want to check out Tails, the bootable usb software put out by the official Tor project. It&#039;s an alternative to Liberte, and although I personally like Liberte much better, people who know much more than me on the subject still argue both cases. (I don&#039;t know if Tails will boot to mac any better, but you can try.)

				Ok thank you Carbonic. I&#039;m guessing if I VNC into my home (windows) computer from my Mac at college that would not be secure right? So my best bet is probably a dual boot windows?<br /><br />And I&#039;m not sure if any of you have experience buying fake IDs but what do you think about Peach vs DI?<br />
