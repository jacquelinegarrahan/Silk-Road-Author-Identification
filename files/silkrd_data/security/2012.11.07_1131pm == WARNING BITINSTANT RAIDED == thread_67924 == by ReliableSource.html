OFAC acts under Presidential national emergency powers, as well as authority granted by specific legislation, to impose controls on transactions and freeze assets under US jurisdiction.

				bitinstant got ddos&#039;d and now they are using cloudfront to protect themselves which is clearly sensitive to tor, as using tor funnels everyone through just a few IPs so those IPs look like part of the DDOS.<br /><br />If I had to guess I&#039;d say that whomever DDOS&#039;d bitinstant is now creating accounts here and making shit up. The Feds don&#039;t raid an office and carry off computers while leaving the domain untouched - which it is. Even if the servers were safe from a raid, the DNS provider would hand over the keys in a heartbeat.<br /><br />So the OP is probably connected with the DDOS attack.

				Only replying to this troll thread since it&#039;s already at the top...<br /><br />OP has 2 post count, both in this thread, and named ReliableSource. Wow. C&#039;mon guys, you know better than to listen to a jack-off DEA/LE troll account. Holy shitballs, the location of the main office is right on the website. You brought nothing of value or proof to support this. Fuck off.<br /><br />There is a plethora of options for obtaining BTC. Newsflash: SilkRoad and BitCoins have been around for a lot longer than BitInstant. Yes, BitInstant is by far my preferred method, but if it doesn&#039;t come back, or completely loses anonymity, a dozen replacements will spring up in no time.<br /><br />Since I don&#039;t feel like posting on the several different ZOMG BITINSTANT IS DEAD/RAIDED/CAN&#039;T USE WITHOUT MY REAL NAME BAWWWW threads, I&#039;ll also include this. The OFAC compliance that they mentioned is for BTC -&gt; e-mail options. Use someone&#039;s name/b-date that you know or can pull from FaceBook easily and find a place that doesn&#039;t ID for MoneyGram payments. OR go with MtGox coupons/USD since they don&#039;t require info unless you fuck up and try to access on Tor.<br /><br />Or, holy shit, here&#039;s a crazy thought- Take a fuckin&#039; risk and use your real name. The DEA/LE can have that .001% chance increase of knowing my real name when I legally purchase my BTCs. The rest of the puzzle is so ridiculously complex they wouldn&#039;t even waste their time on a small-time cannabis buyer, even knowing that information. They have limited resources and their prime mission is to go for the highest on the chain, the guys that are living the fattest, as they say.<br /><br />And sidenote- Tor isn&#039;t required for BitInstant and their payment processor sites. The Tor network doesn&#039;t need the extra load of bandwidth for non-sensitive activity like that. Use a VPN for accessing clearnet privately if you&#039;re that worried about it.

				apologies for bumping the troll post but I got a question guys.<br /><br />So I usually use the bank deposit Bitinstant method. However its all screwed up with the ddos, so I&#039;m going with the moneygram option.

MoneyGram will verify that the ZipZap invoice is actually made based on the transaction number and deny it if it doesn&#039;t exist. I definitely wouldn&#039;t chance a bank deposit even if it was available... hmm... I personally wouldn&#039;t try a MoneyGram but I don&#039;t think the payment will be lost forever. Just possibly delayed if you have to call/e-mail to have it verified manually. Good luck and let us know how it goes! <br /><br />I&#039;ve only done 2 MGs compared to like 60+ bank deposits though.. but I far prefer MG now. MtGox is literally funded the -same minute- I get the receipt for paying MG.
