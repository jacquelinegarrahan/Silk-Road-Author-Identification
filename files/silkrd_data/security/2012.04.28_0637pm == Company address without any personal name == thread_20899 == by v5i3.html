				Please don&#039;t point me immediately to other thread, I&#039;ve read a lot about &#039;which address should i take for shipping&#039;, but I still have a question.<br />My parents run a small company with some employees.<br />We actually receive letters for people who have worked in the company 5 years ago, and the letters still&nbsp; arrive.<br />Some letters are also just written to the company name without any&nbsp; salutation of my fathers&#039; name or any other name of a person.<br /><br />So why shouldn&#039;t I just take the name of the company and the full address (street,city) without any personal name?<br />For more detail: I want to order a small amount of acid, so the risk of being caught is very small anyway, but if they can&#039;t refer to any person.<br /><br />Do I have an error in reasoning at dealing this way?

				The letter would probably arrive, but I can see many vendors not wanting to send to an address without a name.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty sketchy, they would probably consider it too risky.&nbsp; As for using someone else&#039;s name, that would also probably arrive, but you&#039;d have to be really watching the mail to make sure you get it first.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t want your parents to go, &quot;Oh, that person hasn&#039;t been here in years, just throw that out.&quot;

				Unless you&#039;re there everyday able to intercept the mail I wouldn&#039;t risk it. Someone might open the letter before you and freak out when they find what&#039;s inside.

				I&#039;m there everyday but I am not an early bird, so it&#039;s probably risky.<br />Probably it&#039;s better to use the own name.. Anyone could send anyone everything right?

				I wouldnt put my parents company at risk for a shittly little order. It could throw the eye on them for other things, and just say their tax affairs weren&#039;t in order, and the got in trouble over that all because of you. <br /><br />You are a big boy now, go find somewhere else :)

There&#039;s nothing sketchy about that, lots of people receive mail for their small business using a d/b/a name instead of their personal one.

				No I would just name the name o the company in first line with the normal house addresses.<br />I am able to ask the vendor if he is willing to send it without a personal name... so i have the choice
