				hows it going people. im just looking to find out if there are any reputable places i can buy bitcoins with my credit card/ cash card?<br /><br />afterwards, whats the best way to tumble to ensure complete anonymity? would bouncing between a few bitcoin address&#039;s, SR and pecunix do the job. or would it need to be a bit more sophisticated than this?

				In my opinion you can send the purchased coins directly to new address located on your computers bitcoin client. Then wait a little bit and send them to Silk Road account.<br /><br />To successfully prove anything, they need to:<br />1. prove that you purchased bitcoins and sent them to particular address - this is possible if exchange cooperates with LEA.<br />2. Prove that the address the coins was sent is owned by you, not anyone else. This is not possible, unless they get your computer unencrypted. You must do full drive encryption with Truecrypt!<br />3. Prove that the coins was sent to Silk Road address after withdrawal. This is not possible, unless Silk Road is compromised. This will bring much more problems than tracking coins.<br /><br />So in my opinion there is no need for such extra security steps, unless you are buying alpaca socks with the coins you have received for assassinating president of US. They are waste of coins and blockchain space.
