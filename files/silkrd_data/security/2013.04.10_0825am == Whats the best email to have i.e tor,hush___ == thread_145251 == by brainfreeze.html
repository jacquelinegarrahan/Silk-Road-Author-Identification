				Tormail has had problems lately, but I&#039;ve liked their service in the past because you can connect to it through their onion (hidden Tor) address.&nbsp; But yeah, assume anything you send through their servers will be read by a third party -- no matter what service you use, you should always assume that; so in other words: _always_ encrypt your messages.&nbsp; Even if they aren&#039;t sensitive.&nbsp; You never what could come back and bite you, it&#039;s so worth the extra hassle of encrypting and decrypting.<br /><br />Hushmail is a honeypot.&nbsp; Use it if you want, but it&#039;s totally unsafe.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even realize it was still up, frankly.&nbsp; As long as you only connect to something through Tor though, you could use yahoo for all it really matters (except they block Tor, but just as example) -- but whatever you use, be damn sure you never log in to it even once without using Tor.

				^^yeah, definitely avoid hushmail. You might as well just look for free email providers hosted in &#039;appropriate&#039; countries.<br /><br />Tormail is the standard around here; lavabit is another one that claims privacy and all that. Just don&#039;t trust any of them completely and always PGP anything you want to remain private.
