				Hey ya&#039;lls. Forgive the tosser acct :(<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and get through ti short to. mispenlling hahah. Okay... about 2 months ago i was<br /><br />Was travelin in the world someware ay and got stopped by the the bad dudes. <br /><br />Now i know a lot. I&#039;ve studied a lot. But i was getting super retarded in regards to feeling i&#039;d never get stopped. <br /><br />so i was breaking the golden fuckin rule of burnin while drivn. well what tf did i care, i had nothin... welll i had maybe a little couple somethings.... <br /><br />THIS IS JUST A REMINDER TO ANYONE who is slipping on their golden rules of what they KNOW or at one point felt they wer 100% vital to success in this game. I&#039;m just saying generally i&#039;m smart mother fucker but for a while i have been lit on the 24/7 and not even fuckin on point. so basically they stopped me, searched everything. got any and all info on me they could. I wasn&#039;t prepared, had some little insignificant shit to the unknower. and i&#039;ll probably my property back that they stole. had some items that they took that i won&#039;t get back as well. <br /><br />i share this because i could have avoided wht i now have to deal with. don&#039;t ever get to relaxed. because i said i&#039;d never either and here i am. practice with trusted friends. cause it&#039;s real easy to forget everything you wished you would have said or not said. <br /><br />just always make sure you throw every fuckin burger receet,&nbsp; mail, personal docs etc.... away and never get off your game. <br /><br />Nothing really connected to here, but I&quot;M here. so it was a bit of a shaker upper. <br /><br /><br />Sorry i can&#039;t give more details. stay safe ya&#039;ls
