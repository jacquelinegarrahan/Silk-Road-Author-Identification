				I dunno about instawallets saw some scam accusations on them.I can verify that btcfog is working <br />got my money through it during this week (everyday a bit to always new btc addresses) they r unreachable someitmes<br />but always came back up so far. But 100% percent trust is impossible they could go scam everyday... so dont put more money into it <br />than your willing to loose. Spray your btc of a couple of easywallets and from there always a few btc to btcfog let them sit there for a day or two and get them out<br />never same amounts in and out for example&nbsp; transfer 5 btc get two out , new btc adress in btcfog , transfer 10 btc and get 8 out and so on....<br /><br />But i guess u already know that.<br /><br />Hope u will get your money safely to sr :)<br /><br />best regards<br />&nbsp;

				Instawallet is very safe. It takes about an hour to process and verify your coins. Just make sure you backup the web address so you don&#039;t lose your coins!

				Any time that you place your coins in a wallet that is not personally controlled by you (meaning: BTC client downloaded on your computer), you&#039;re risking someone walking off with your coins. There have been several high-profile hacks of BTC exchanges.<br /><br />That said, InstaWallet &amp; BitCoinFog have been dependable in the past.<br /><br />Your best bet is just to buy the coins right before you use them. This minimizes your exposure to BTC value fluctuation and decreases the amount of time that you&#039;re vulnerable to an e-wallet hack.

				thesearstower: under NO circumstances would I keep bitcoins loitering around :D. Indeed, I firmly believe in buying the BC just before a SR purchase. I&#039;ll probably buy 1-2 more than I need. That shouldn&#039;t be a problem to leave loitering in the SR account.

On your BitCoin client installed to your computer. Make sure it&#039;s virus free and encrypted (hint: linux) and that you have a backup of the wallet.dat file.<br /><br />2. Your MtGox or Intersango account<br /><br />3. Silk Road<br /><br />Other places like instawallet, I&#039;m not so fond off, but with smaller amounts I might trust them. Maybe.<br /><br />Bitcoin fog has an excellent track record in terms of reliability. At least for now, but keep in mind that you&#039;re still handing over your BTC to a completely anonymous third party.

				I am not very fond of MTGox. Because of all the legal documents they require for a pathetic SEPA transfer, I view them as arrogant. They&#039;re a big trader so now they seem to me like very likely to cooperate with law enforcement not to mention that they&#039;re on the radar of law enforcement. I suppose any website that gets so big will eventually become a bit too strict for my liking.<br /><br />As for keeping the BitCoins, I&#039;m not sure I would keep them on SR. It&#039;s just a few days ago that DPR posted a rather pessimistic message (the one with the backup URLs in case the site goes down). Either donate a part to SR / various causes and transfer the rest to local BitCoin client or just purchase until one is left with less than 1 BC.

				If your too worried about your coins going missing use blockchain.info to send anonymous and use their wallet software.<br /><br />Very unlikely that they will turn scam.

However if you do use their service, then the wallet they give you is a pretty safe place to keep coins. <br /><br />The post with the backup URL&#039;s is pretty old, and it&#039;s just a backup in case something bad happens. He&#039;s not saying that it&#039;s a likely event, just a good precaution.
