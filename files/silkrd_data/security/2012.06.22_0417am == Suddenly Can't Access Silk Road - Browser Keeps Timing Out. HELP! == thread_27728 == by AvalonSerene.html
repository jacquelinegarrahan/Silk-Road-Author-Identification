				I&#039;ve been a regular Silk Road user for ages - even logged on just the other day! <br />A few days ago I tried to log on to the onion network but Mozilla kept telling me as below:<br /><br />The connection has timed out<br />- The server at silkroadvb5piz3r.onion is taking too long to respond.<br />- The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; moments.<br />- If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer&#039;s network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; connection.<br />&nbsp;- If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.<br /><br />At first I thought it may have been network problems and wasn&#039;t too concerned but it&#039;s been a few days now and still no access! Argh! I can access the Armory with no problems at all! But Silk Road is a no go. <br />Is something going on?<br />Any help will be so, so, so thoroughly appreciated!

				Okay... I just re-downloaded and installed Tor and it&#039;s STILL not working! Again, no problems at all with accessing The Armory but Silk Road will just not load. <br />*Totallyfreakingout*

				Try resetting your router. I have no idea what it could be, but that is what I would do next.

				You don&#039;t have to reinstall tor, either stop tor and start it again or right click on the vidalia icon in the taskbar and select &quot;New Identity&quot;.
