				can someone point be to the right thread for tails. i want to have persistance if im not mistaken. didnt realize you cant save anything and when i wanted to use it again eerything was gone. and im like duh dummy. should of firgured that one out. but the persistance one is somewhat cumbersome. let me know if i am out of line for asking this how to. i like liberte linux becuase t saves your stuff. but i find tails easier and cleaner in a way. i like that erases your stuff but got to figure out how not to reload everything one by one so i can use tails from now on and not go on to the SR the way i have been now.

				Yep, no persistence with Tails, and, yeah, the browser anyway on liberte can be a pain...<br /><br />What I do, is just have an online account for this purpose...like Dropbox, tho I prefer someone less popular: swissdisk comes to mind, wuala is another good one...and then open Tails, and open online storage at same time, download the file, plain text, or html, depending, with your passwords and stuff, and you&#039;re good to go...<br /><br />A handy way I&#039;ve found, is to use keypass, and make an account, putting all the passwords/usernames/pgp pass phrases/onion url sites...and them export them in an html file ...<br /><br />All kinds of ways to get around the &#039;persistence&#039; problem ... another avenue is privatix, which uses a regular FF browser and has persistence...you can google, but like liberte, not a lot of english info.....<br /><br />good luck, lots of fun studying up on all this....but Paypal does keep you honest with not accidentally storing a bunch of stuff that you don&#039;t want around...just store all the junk you need on one file in wuala/swissdisk and it only takes a minute to download it all when u need to get rolling....

				I&#039;m working from memory, so I could be wrong (and waiting on the *late* mailman ha ha)&nbsp; But anyway: on windows, I actually had keepass, not keypassx, and I believe the windows keypass had the option of exporting the file in html mode, so I saved it on desktop, then uploaded and stashed it in swissdisk.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keepassx is handy because I can use it on linux and windows, but if I remember right, they don&#039;t give u the html option, which is just an easy way to save and use, download to desktop. <br /><br />The other way, as you&#039;ve discovered, is just to save as a plaintext doc or something like that, and yeah, upload...there are several ways to do it.&nbsp; Mostly I just save it in whatever mode keypassx has *.kdb I believe, then just quickly install keypassx on all my machines...if I&#039;m using tails, for example, with no persistence, I either save it as just a text file, or, in my case, since I had it saved html, I download that whenever I open tails..<br /><br />All of it kind of interesting, kind of a pain...and partly trying both keypass, and then keypassx, then you&#039;ll see the difference.&nbsp; http://keepass.info/index.html&nbsp; &nbsp;and http://www.keepassx.org/<br /><br />EDIT: To keep Tails tight, as soon as it boots I open root terminal then run: <br />apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install tor &amp;&amp; service tor start<br /><br />and:<br /><br />apt-get install keepassx<br /><br />then go to online storage spot: my favorite for working good in tor, and anonymity is swissdisk.com<br /><br />I set iceweasal preferences to download to Desktop, then download my keepassx files, and my pgp keys ... and I&#039;m good to go...tried&#039;em all: like tails the best....works good, browser is one I&#039;m used to, and it loads with everything I want except keypassx...<br />
