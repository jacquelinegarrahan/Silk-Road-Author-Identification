				I mainly only buy bulk, so with the recent news that davidd was compromised, of course I was heartbroken. Buying bulk domestically has been pretty hard recently but I&#039;ve been able to find some here and there. I ordered 50g of a product from a vendor and for some reason I decided to use Privnote. It was only AFTER doing this that I read in the forums that this is typically a bad move. <br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m really asking is, how paranoid SHOULD I be after doing so?

				Long story, but I&#039;ll try to include as much as possible.<br /><br />About a month or so ago I ordered 10g from davidd. Having been pleased with his service, I decided to order 20g from him. I was asked to FE as this was only my second transaction, so I did withe no hesitation seeing as he has over 300 transactions and having a rating of 100. Days later, still no package, so I decided to message him about it. No reply for a few days, but it showed that he had read my messages. Eventually he replied and said that the batch he sent out was bunk and was going to refund me my $500 that I FE&#039;d for. Days pass and still no refund. He kept going on about he was going to receive a new batch and that he would reimburse me. I figured he had selectively scammed me so I talk to SR support about it. I was informed that there was nothing they could do and that the ball was in the vendor&#039;s court. Upsetting as it was, I dealt with it and decided to go to a different vendor. A few weeks after this incident, davidd messages me back and tells me that he is willing to do 100g for the unbelievable price of $1,000 and that he would also include the 20g, so 120g for $1000. Luckily I didn&#039;t have the funds readily available so I wasn&#039;t able to make the purchase (he had titled the custom order &quot;Special order for a special friend&quot;). A few weeks or so had passed and I noticed that his rating had gone away, as if he was no longer a vendor. I messaged SR support about it, and replied that multiple users had reported that he was compromised and was going after bulk buyers.

				I should also add that the whole time, he was in stealth mode and had hidden all his user ratings and his listings. I guess I should&#039;ve taken that as a hint but alas, I was too trusting of the rating system.

				JMO, but it sounds more like a scam and less like he was &#039;compromised,&quot; unless by compromised you mean he stole your money.
