				I&#039;ve made about 10 orders from overseas all from the same vendor and they have all made it through customs ranging from 2 to 10 grams, I was recently arrested and made bail for a completely unrelated incident (although quite serious). When I got out on bail an order I made from overseas never showed up, no seizure notice and no letters from the police (this was months ago and still nothing has arrived). <br /><br />Recently I was talking to a close friend on a brand new cell phone with a new SIM card (only 2 other close friends know this number). The next day that person got a text message from a random number asking about me (using my full name) and how he knew me. He tried to call that person but no one picked up. He told me about the call and sent me the persons number, I tried calling and no one picks up. Am I being paranoid or are the police watching me? I&#039;ve destroyed the SIM card and I&#039;m only using pay phones now. In my country you must verify your ID before you can buy a SIM card so it&#039;s pretty hard to get an anonymous phone number, therefore it is a possibility the cops are aware of that number.<br /><br />Should I be worried? I&#039;m not completely sure what I said to my friend in that phone conversation but I&#039;m assuming I said some pretty bad shit as I was high as fuck.

That&#039;s unusual story, but laying low for a bit looks like a good idea for you right now. Stay safe!
