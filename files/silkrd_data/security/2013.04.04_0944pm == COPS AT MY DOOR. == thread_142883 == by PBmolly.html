				No he has orders shipped to a PO box in his name. They must have came to the PO box store and requested the address. They also had his cell phone number on file, bc they have a system that calls or messages ur phone when a package arrives. The voicemail said the officers name, he stated he was from Homeland Security and he wants to talk left a number with an out of state area code. Said something about my friend not being in trouble, if he talks to them, they said they were not interested in him they were interested in someone else. He ordered somewhere in between 30-84 g of Mol I think from up north. What should I tell him to do ? No is not planning on talking to them.

				Yes I do, But I would prefer not to disclose that in the forums. He is in the top 20% of vendors I think and been a trustworthy vendor with 100% feedback currently. Maybe a mod can PM me. My friend has contacted the Vendor already but has not gotten a reply yet as of now.

				so your friend is using your address for his po box? thats not possible at all has to be the same on his divers license.. did your friend get the txt message when it arrived at the ups store? because thats the only place that does that type of offering when you receive a package with tracking that i know of.. and your saying he orderd 30-84 grams of MDMA? their is no vender on here that sells in those increments at all?<br />your best bet is to clean house if this is real and stay away from anything bad for a little to let things cool down..

				agree with mr domestic.&nbsp; These cops gave you a gift.&nbsp; They are giving you a chance to not get in trouble, take it.&nbsp; Clean house, clean your computer.&nbsp; Call a drug lawyer, and get some proper advice.&nbsp; Maybe have the lawyer call them and at least sees if this is about the molly, maybe it isnt.&nbsp; Maybe your buddy works with someone who is being investigated.&nbsp; Hell, he could know someone who applied for a DHS job and the agents are doing background interviews.&nbsp; Maybe call the lawyer first and have him figure out what is going on.&nbsp;

				They showed up to his door. Not me, The title of the thread was just the subject statement. Sorry for the confusion, I am not worried about posting here bc he has a clean house and they have not kicked in his door yet with a warrant yet. I messaged scout who the vendor was, hope this all works out good for my friend. Should he just act like he has no idea what they are talking about, or not talk at all and get a good lawyer.?

				Well shit. This thread has my blood pressure up for sure. Ordered MDMA a few times from Canada. Actually, I thought Canada &gt;&gt; US was the easiest on customs. Maybe I was wrong :( Definitely will be cleaning house with this next shipment, just in case. At least with a clean house I know I can handle the cops with a clear conscience. As in keep my mouth closed and keep my nerves under control. Honestly, assuming you&#039;re about to get caught is probably one of the best ways of keeping on your toes.

				Okay&nbsp; guys Silkroad is a public playground LE is crawling on here.&nbsp; If one of the top vendors is shipping from a non-flagged country you can bet your fucking ass they will look at packages originating from that area/country more closely.&nbsp; To say that Canada has more package volume and isn&#039;t overseas doesn&#039;t make it invincible, you take a risk when you order things like these.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you had it sent to a falsely registered PO box then it would be very difficult for them to trace you down provided that you take all necessary precautions in picking it up, (calling a cab from a burner phone in front of a multi story complex to the PO box)

				I always thought that LE doesnt attempt controlled delivery or get warrants for smaller amounts (less than 100 or 200 grams) becasue it was a waste of their time and resources and it takes a,lot of money&nbsp; and planning to attempt conrolled delivery. Its possible, but unlikely that maybe LE was the vendor in questiom and he forwarded your name to the US HMS. <br />aslo, like the HMS officers stated, it wasnt about you, but about someone else. Its possible thsat this is completely unrelated, and that your pack will show up uneventful.<br />But always exercize of side of caution if your not sure!

All of those orders were for multiple kilos of MDMA, and he kept sending out more packages even after he kept getting them seized. I think a lot of people were busted from this, although some of the smarter ones used fake ID boxes and were spared.

				DHS handles drugs now too? That&#039;s news to me, I always thought it would be DEA or the FEDS...But even the FEDS don&#039;t really handle drugs cases anymore either ever since 9/11..<br /><br />Tell your friend don&#039;t call a lawyer right away.. Have one on standby. It&#039;s DHS and f or a shipment that small it would be a waste of time for them.&nbsp; I see&nbsp; it passed to the DEA and local police as they would have a field day for 3 zips.. Having a lawyer call would only make him look suspicious and have him looked into more..Because LE are a bunch of curious set of people..Find out what they want first by calling, it could be nothing..If in fact they do start to harass him about drugs or something that implicates him doing something illegal along with evidence than I think it would be necessary to call a lawyer...<br /><br />Why look guilty when trying to look innocent? As mentioned above it could be someone applying for a federal job and doing a background check or something else that has to do with national security...

				&nbsp;My friend has still not heard a word from any LE as of now. He has not talked to anyone but a few close friends who he can trust. If he does ever talk to someone, he will not say anything and will have his lawyer talk and deny everything. My friend had been using SR for a little bit, had a few other successful packages come through from all over the world, he never had one not show until now. I still do not want to give out who the vendor was, but Im sure if you do some reading you can figure it out yourself, and it is not LL just to make things clear.&nbsp; The vendor was very quick to offer a full refund of the package to my friend. The package was shipped tracked prob was gonna be in a package bc the amount. This was very nice of the vendor, as in im sure he will be needing the funds for a good lawyer. The vendor shows positive feedback on other similar size packages, that came though around the same time, and is still at 100% feedback. I am thinking about starting up a donation bitcoin address for my friend to help cover lawyer costs and court fees.

				His PO box was being used for SR for a little bit and also real items randomly. And sorry PB stands for Peanut Butter , Pussy Beater, Play Boy, but not a college town in Cali. On top of my friend has the problem not me. <br /><br />maple- why do you say PO boxes do not have the same plausible denial that a home address does.? Anyone could have tried to set him up, and send him illegal things.<br /><br />I hope everyone is staying safe out there, and do not wish this on anyone.<br /><br />Stay smart and order domestically right now to be very safe or from a very trusted vendor with insane stealth, as in if the cops open the pak they still will have no idea whats in it.

Overall LL seems decent. Usually I&#039;ll mentally stay away from a vendor if I see a negative trend of reviews with certain negative characteristics and if they can seem to have credibility. I haven&#039;t checked LL&#039;s reviews recently, but maybe things have changed in that respect. I&#039;ll have to check again, I admit. But I do remember some security incidents mentioned. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that I take a 1-star review only saying &quot;vendor sucks.&quot; to heart. I actually disregard those. But it&#039;s generally the detailed descriptions of how things played out, and, as I said before I remember talk of some incident. <br /><br />Thanks for the character check though. I&#039;ll do a bit more research next time before saying anything negative, especially if the storm&#039;s blown over and I didn&#039;t know about it.<br /><br />Cheers all<br />-PS

				A mailbox in a fake name would be more useful if every package you receive contains a light sensor to warn you if it is opened. However, I think LE would catch on to that, start x-raying packages to find those devices, and open in them in dark rooms.<br />

				I know for a fact they visited him bc of what was in the package. I find it odd that they showed up at his door and then called and messaged him, but have not made any other effort to contact him. I feel like if they wanted to bust his ass they would have kicked in the door with a warrant. Or came back the following day with one, unless they are still investigating and trying to collect more information. The part that is bugging my friend is that the DHS agent that messaged and called him has an out of state area code, and it seems to be a personal / work cell phone. Is this DHS agent in town just for this case? The town he lives in is not huge but not small, the 2nd or 3rd largest city in the state.<br /><br />-JohnSnow- PM&#039;ed you!

As well as the vendor tracked the package and it showed it was intercepted.<br /><br />I still find it very odd the DHS agent sent him two text messages, but I have looked at his phone myself and read them. Why would they waste there time with texts and not call his phone or show up at his door again? <br />

				I know for a fact this is about a &quot;package&quot; my friend got. And DHS does get involved with drugs that are shipped internationally. DHS are customs investigation enforcers pretty much. Also the vendor has confirmed that all of his packages sent around the same time and same package style and possibly same return address are &quot;stuck&quot; in customs. The tracking numbers prove this. He has changed his shipping method and packages and successfully coming though now.

				There are no hard and fast rules on how LE will handle a situation. There are a vast amount of variables that can effect their course of action. Right off the bat I would say that your friend is lucky and has little to worry about at this time. They intercepted the package, meaning he never received it. To even try and make a case, your friend would have had to at least receive the package. If they wanted to try and bust him they would have done a controlled delivery, not intercept the package. If they wanted to start surveillance on him, they wouldn&#039;t have tipped him off that they were on to him. The fact that it was Homeland Security is probably a good thing. A small pack of molly is not something that would usually show up on their radar. It very well could have been a slow week for them and so they decided to see if they could get some information from you on who is sending the packages. As far as calling them back, I would either not do it or consult with an attorney before you do. If they had enough to bring you in for questioning, they wouldn&#039;t be giving you the choice. Even if they do have enough to bring you in, they aren&#039;t doing it. Which again tells me this isn&#039;t something high on their priority list. Now none of this means your out of the woods. Assume that Homeland Security has handed this over to local LE, and they are going to be watching you. Definitely watching what your receiving in the mail. If you plan on continuing to &quot;do what you do&quot; you need to move away. Your current situation is smoked.

				Although it seems unlikely an federal agent handling a case like this would identify themselves specifically as DHS, and not a sister federal LEO, as one of the affects of Bush creating DHS was merging Customs, Immigration and Border Security under the Department of Homeland Security. Which could explain why his friend was visited by someone identifying themselves as a DHS agent, allegedly.

				Still another day that my friend has had no contact from anyone. He is talking with a lawyer soon just to see what he advises. Just wanted to let everyone know he is still alive and well and not in jail. He actually even made out without losing any money at all, he actually gained some money bc of the bitcoin rise and he cashed in his coins before the recent drop.<br />

				OP, perform a complete disk wipe. <br />Before you start, put Tor on USB stick if you don&#039;t have one already.<br /><br />1. Download DBAN from (http://www.dban.org/) - Use tor browser.<br /><br />2. Burn the image onto a cd-r or a DVD-R (bootable USB stick works also)<br /><br />3. Insert the wipe disk and boot it from BIOS - Same way you&#039;d install windows the first time onto a blank computer.<br /><br />4. Let it do the work and finish<br /><br />5. Re-install windows from Disk or any preferred boot media.<br /><br />6. Download SlimCleaner @ (https://www.slimwareutilities.com/slimcleaner.php) - Using tor for download is optional<br /><br />7. Open SlimCleaner and go to &quot;Disk Tools&quot; in the left hand side of the window<br /><br />8. Select &quot;Shredder&quot; - Go to your Tor Installation folder and wipe with Guttmann method.<br /><br />9. Click &quot;Disk Wiper&quot; and select your drive(s). If maximum paranoia, select Guttmann method from the Wipe Security-menu. From the other menu, select &quot;Free Space Only&quot;<br /><br />10. Sit back and let it work, it will take quite an long time. <br /><br />11. If you followed the steps, you now have a windows installation that is close to crystal clean. It is highly unlike that someone can recover any wiped data from your previous installation, although wipe software is never 100% dependable. Only way to get rid of data absolutely permanently is to through your computer into molten lava.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				MrAnonymous- You are completely wrong my friend. Police will do anything to try and get you to talk to them or turn yourself in. They told my friend they were on to him, I even listened to the voice mail the agent left. So please don&#039;t tell other people they are lying when you clearly don&#039;t know what you are talking about.<br /><br />sbmafia- If you read the entire thread, you can get plenty of information about my friends problem. I do not feel safe going into any further details, encase LE are on these forums.<br /><br />mrmdma- Thanks for the advice but, as I am a Computer Information Systems major, this has already been done. Also our PC&#039;s are fully encrypted with TrueCrypt, as well as having a 64 character YubiKey as a password.&nbsp;

				Some people on here are complete fucking idiots. Of course LE uses these tactics, half the time&nbsp; they can get people to confess because most criminals are fucking retards. And yes, of course DHS deals with these kind of issues. The DEA typically won&#039;t get involved unless it&#039;s a bigger deal. In these types of situations it&#039;s DHS and sometimes Postal Inspectors and possibly multi-agency effort depending on the magnitude. I&#039;ve heard of many CD&#039;s, this is the first time I&#039;ve ever used the SR but I&#039;ve been ordering packages international for many years so I&#039;ve heard of some really stupid shit that LE does during controlled deliveries.

				Wow guys, I must admit, I ran out of popcorn right around 4th page of this tread, gotta go grab some more! Very entertaining - mix of fear, suspicion, accusations, hearsay, and speculation. I&#039;m sure LE are digging this thread :)

				No updates, my friend has still not heard a word from LE. I am thinking they have bigger things to worry about now like the bombing and people sending poison in the mail. I hope they don&#039;t step up domestic mail inspection because of the poisoned letters.

				Still nothing as of now. I think my friend is in the clear, for now at least. His name and address may be watched from now on but who knows. I do know he accidentally ordered a shitload of mushroom spores in giant syringes and sent them to his same PO box that the package got popped, and they came through without a problem. They were not opened or tampered with in any way. He also got some random shit from ebay, just to make his PO box look legit. He is wondering if it would be even remotely safe to order one last package to this same PO box as it expires the first week of next month? Maybe they will only look into packages from overseas? Even if it is from out of the country, they still have to have a warrant to open your mail right as long as its USPS? What do you guys think? Is he pushing his luck?

That is some solid advice, thanks. +1 to you! Im going to convince him not to order anything to that box. Do u think changing his PO location would even do anything? Or should he get a fake/drop point ?

				i think a personal address of someone you know that has no <br />connection to this world at all. has a totally clean residence<br />and preferably a small business of some sort. that way there is plenty <br />of normal heavy traffic to that addy. but i guess that depends on what <br />quantity you plan on ordering. larger amounts may require a different plan <br />of action that maybe some other people on here could shed light to.
