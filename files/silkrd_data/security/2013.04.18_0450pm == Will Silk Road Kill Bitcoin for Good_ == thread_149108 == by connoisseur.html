				I seriously doubt Gox hold 90% of the bitcoins, they&#039;re an exchange, they make money from bitcoins being bought and sold, it doesn&#039;t make sense for them to hold the majority.

It&#039;s more than likely a person or small group of people with a bit of bandwidth and some short positions on Bitcoin just trying to maximize their profits through panic selling via DDOS on exchanges.<br /><br />Where did you get that 90% value if you don&#039;t mind me asking? I know they facilitate 80% of all Bitcoin TRANSACTIONS, but not 80% of the entire Bitcoins in circulation. How would having a large offline wallet make a DDOS attack &quot;possible&quot;? What did Satoshi build in? The blockchain is not &quot;too big to fuck up&quot; as we are experiencing with the waste of UTXO space via bitdust transactions like losing bets on SatoshiDice. As it is they are thinking of seperating the node classes to makeup for this. Having a full node would require a monsterous amount of bandwidth and a server, AKA centralization. Not good.<br /><br />Couldn&#039;t agree more. This is why services like Bitcoin-OTC and BTCJam need to be streamlined to allow more Bitcoin users to sell/lend coins directly to potential buyers. <br /><br />Not far off. China has already implemented a similar policy. They are making it harder to convert USD to Bitcoins as they know this will deter the most use of the currency. <br /><br />Hehe well I&#039;m not too worried about drones as they can be taken over and controlled via a $1000 GPS Spoofer.

This is one of mt gox&#039;s biggest failures, especially being that it conducts such a huge percentage of the total buy and sell transactions. If there is a buyer or a seller of last resort, then exchanges won&#039;t be overwhelmed by a flood of buy orders for which there are not enough sellers, or vice versa. These market makers will do the job of buying when there are not enough sellers, or selling when there are not enough buyers. And we certainly need to cut mt gox down to size, so it goes to maybe 30% or even less of all transactions.<br /><br />Also, it was mentioned that the bitcoin network is now large enough that a 51% attack is pretty well impossible, which obviously is a good thing.

				Whether or not that article is correct, that is one snazzy graphic.<br /><br />Let&#039;s put some different numbers on it. Adi Shamir and a colleague analyzed the block chain up to block 180,000 and determined that 22% of bitcoins were in circulation (78% have never been transferred between addresses). Assuming that number is still valid, of the 11 million coins that have been mined, about 2.4 million are in circulation. At the current exchange rate, that&#039;s $240 million of wealth.<br /><br />Of course, not all of these coins are being exchanged for state backed currency. Many of them are simply transferred between addresses owned by the same person. It&#039;s impossible to know how many are exchanged, because even if we knew how much trade was going on at all the exchanges, we know very little about F2F exchanges, like on localbitcoins.com.<br /><br />Also, a lot of the coins are bought and sold multiple times by day traders. If I sell 10 BTC, wait for the price to drop a few percent, and buy back 10.5 BTC, on paper that looks like 20.5 BTC have been exchanged, but really only 0.5 BTC has.<br /><br />So the real question is, how much money will be spent on bitcoins this year by people who don&#039;t later sell them. $50 million? Maybe, I have no idea.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s look at Silk Road. The $22 million figure for annual sales is a lower bound. Nicolas Christin admits in his paper that he can only estimate the public listings, based on public reviews. We don&#039;t know how many stealth vendors and listings there are, and these may be the biggest sales on the site. Vendors build trusted relationships with a few buyers, then go stealth and offer bigger orders. It seems like you would want to, in order to make up for lost public sales. So SR&#039;s annual revenue could be twice the lower bound or more.<br /><br />By that measure, SR makes up close to 100% of actual trade for goods and services in the bitcoin economy. :)<br /><br />Well, who knows. It&#039;s all guess work. Don&#039;t believe that 20% figure in the article either, because they don&#039;t know.<br /><br />But even in this scenario, what would it mean if SR goes out of business? Probably not much. There would still be $200 million in wealth transferred around and day traded, and that would continue, and probably grow.<br />

If the mechanism could put an end or at least slow down this volatility, though, it would be well worth trying. I suppose that would mean some kind of regulatory agency that would mandate such a thing but then, that goes contrary to the spirit of total freedom attached to bitcoin. On the other hand, maybe some &quot;growing up&quot; is called for in the bitcoin community. Either that or accept these horrendous price fluctuations that seem totally random and irrational.<br /><br />Or maybe, what about some superfund that could be set up by implementing a set of fees on bitcoin transactions? I&#039;m just talking off the top of my head here, but what about 5% on sales of bitcoins and maybe 1% on simple sending, to be split between the buyer and seller or between the sender and receiver? I could be off by an order of magnitude, but you get the idea. And this superfund could be used to do that market making and try to get over these extraordinary days of mass panic selling (as well as mass panic buying). <br /><br />It might be possible to do it by modifying the code, couldn&#039;t it?
