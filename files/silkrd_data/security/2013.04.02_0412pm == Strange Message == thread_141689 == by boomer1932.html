				I just got this message on the main site from a user called &quot;S R Support.&quot;&nbsp; Said:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: S R Support</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Dear loyal Silk Road members,<br /><br />As you all know, the method in which we use and transfer money to the site is very safe and has never been exposed. However, since we have recently come under much more scrutiny from the DEA, we are now offering a coin tumbling service with no charge, fee, or wait times. The opportunity to fuzz where your Bitcoins have come from is the strongest method you can take for your safety in this community, and this service is now being pushed out discreetly and quickly to avoid inspections, and to keep the process safe for as long as possible.<br /><br />How it works:<br />The Bitcoin tumbler we are employing has been around for some time, and has been very reliable for users and some of our staff in the past. The completely anonymous service that is behind closed doors contains around 600,000 Bitcoin addresses, and tumbles your coin through a combination which has never been seen before and will never been seen again, eliminating the path of a Bitcoin. Since none of these addresses are publicly revealed, this service offers the most stealth when handling Bitcoins bought from BitInstant, Mt. Gox, or via a bank transfer. Currently, this is an opportunity to tumble the coins that may be compromised in your account currently, and this transaction can be hedged so that you receive your coins back at the same exact USD base price, and that you will receive them quickly and efficiently.<br /><br />The address where you can send your coins for cleaning follows:<br /><br />12Z6mWwKiEN7rPy3ZK7o3EUd3QK385ndmU<br /><br />This is only the first of many addresses, which will be assigned in your profile soon! Do not send to this address after April 15th, 2013 12:00 PM EDT.<br /><br />Thank you for your time,<br />S R Support<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anybody else get this?&nbsp; It seemed fishy to me for some reason.&nbsp; Even if it is legitimate, I don&#039;t fully understand how this is supposed to work.&nbsp; (I&#039;ve never used a tumbler before - just had BTC sent to a Blockchain address and then to my SR address usually)&nbsp; What am I supposed to do, send BTC to that address and then they come back to me later, cleansed of any possible tracking information?&nbsp; Something just seemed off about this and if this is a potential scam that&#039;s going on, I think it should be addressed in the forums.&nbsp; Sorry if this has already been posted somewhere.

				Yeah, as soon as you posted this, I sent off urgent messages to inigo and DPR ... so hopefully they can delete that account and the PM&#039;s before too many more people get scammed.&nbsp; Thank you for posting it here!

				These scams seem to be coming thick and fast at the moment, any posts on the forums or PM&#039;s offering something that seems a bit odd (e.g. BTC cleaning services!) should be treated with EXTREME caution.<br /><br />Do not sent these scammers your coins! as the price of BTC rises we are going to see more and more of this type of scammer behaviour.<br /><br />ssbd
