				I am having trouble logging into MyBitcoin. Is anyone else having difficulties? I cant get on through TOR or even regularly. Im just wondering if I should panic. I&#039;ve got a good amount of bitcoins tied up there &amp; they dont have an emergency address feature. Im wondering if maybe they have a new site or whats going on. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advanced :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				chances are that we are fucked.. most people seem to think that the site is down and they made off with our BTC.&nbsp; ugh.. it sucks, but i guess i&#039;m just glad that i didn&#039;t have more in the wallet.

				It will obviously have some affect on my entire operation but, luckily its not enough to put me out completely. It just sucks to come back from bday vacay to this -_-... Its my own stupid fault for leaving it there while I was gone. But yes. Fingers crossed. Thats all I&#039;ve got for now :(<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				sorry crane, best of luck, i know this has to be a difficult learning experience but dont let it push you away.&nbsp; If you have developed a respected customer base they will support you through your time of need and continue to purchase, i honestly at one point thought you seemed like a sketchy scammer and steared my business away from you but, i have seen you put forth to better the community and that is not the marksmanship of a scammer.&nbsp; If you come back i will try to help you out by purchasing from you in the future.

Absolutely no offense taken. it is hard to be sure in this world who is real &amp; who is out for a quick buck. This mybitcoin.com scandal is a perfect example. I came here willing to prove myself to this community &amp; took the necessary steps in order to make my name tangible. Now it is just that &amp; I thank you all for your support even when I was new, though I was somewhat of a &quot;late&quot; to get in. But, this bitcoin affair will not send me anywhere. It will hinder me slightly, at best. I will restock my wares later this week &amp; have the ball rolling again by early next week. I&#039;ll even be having Molly return to stay for a bit. I surely do enjoy her company. Until then... I wish you the best of travels upon this Silken Road :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				In the same Boat, a smaller boat but still sizable. I Think out will be back, none of the coins have moved. If something happened to the person holding the keys then we are screwed. <br /><br />if this happened a week before it would have sunk me for sure.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using instawallet for transfers, works well in combination with an encrypted dropbox file. Soon an actual wallet.dat

				With so many people involved and the amount of money that&#039;s at stake, I&#039;m sure a lot of people will keep a close eye on where the money moves to (if it does indeed move). I wouldn&#039;t say that it&#039;s gone for good, but it doesn&#039;t look good. Maybe there is a technical error somewhere on his side,? dunno, but it really surprises me that someone that helped start the bitcoin would do something&nbsp; like this.. theres hope until someone says that its gone for sure...Im pulling for you guys that have money at stake...
