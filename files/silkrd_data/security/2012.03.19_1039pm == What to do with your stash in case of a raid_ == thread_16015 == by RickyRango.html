				I&#039;ve been thinking about my security recently, and I want your guys input.&nbsp; Say worst case scenario, I get raided by the honkers.&nbsp; Is it worth it trying to flush or destroy whatever contraband I have at the time?&nbsp; Will it actually help me legally or just hurt me?<br /><br />Any insight or experience on this subject will be appreciated.&nbsp; 8)

				You wont have time to do anything if the raid team is even the least bit competent. People have noidea how a raid goes down, by the time you&#039;ll realize your being raided you&#039;ll have a gun in your face.<br /><br />Flushing down a toliet rarely works, if its heavy it&#039;ll just end up stuck and they can/will flush it out. Plus if they dont find it they are going to be pissed off and sure you flushed it and really make sure they do an extra thorough job.<br /><br />Best advice I can give is keep your stash off location if you expect you are going to be raided.

				The safest thing is to not have anything.&nbsp; Obviously, it&#039;d be in your best interest to avoid being raided, too.

				I think if they have enough info on you to raid your place, your pretty much fucked anyways.&nbsp; Flushing it down the toilet is for Hollywood.&nbsp; Won&#039;t work even if you had a minute, which you won&#039;t.&nbsp;

				keep most of the stuff safely off-site just incase, like digging down some nice place in water/airtight box in the woods,underwater or something.<br /><br />for some indoors, if you can make a secret room high up like in the roof or something where dogs cant sniff and that would be very hard to find, just like moving some planks and taking away whatever is in there then putting back matching planks so noone can see it, just some small hidden space somewhere.. <br />Even better if you have ur own house get a trusted carpenter to make a bigger hidden compartment some nice place.<br />they never found my hidden stash=P<br /><br />when buying small amounts on street i also used a jacket i had made small incision on top that u couldnt easily see and stuffed whatever tightly packed thru this hole and down near a button or something so it wasnt easily noticed tho hard to get out again. passed some checks with this too^^<br /><br />a bit inconvenient to get to it every time, but I think its worth it and much safer with some extra precautions like that, even tho its never 100%.. workd for me most of the time and Ill continue trying to hide it well manually when I can when I have it indoors anyway

				Ooh! Just leave your entire stash hidden in the toilet, ready to flush at a moments notice! Unfortunately in a raid you don&#039;t really have a moment&#039;s notice, so you&#039;d have to live in the bathroom. :o Wouldn&#039;t that be. . .crappy? Oh alright, I know!

				We agree &quot;off-site&quot; storage is the safest bet. Store any scales, paraphernalia, flash drives, ect, basically &#039;anything&#039; incriminating at that location. <br /><br />Perhaps a cheap art studio or something similar? Opened with a fake, photo-shopped, ID. Just be extra sure you are never followed to your storage location. Circle the block a few times, ect.<br /><br />That&#039;s our advice. :)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				As with all advice here, it depends on where you live. Different places have different rules, so on and so forth. <br /><br />BUT - in general for almost everywhere I know of, if they get to the point of raiding you, you are already pretty fucked. If they can raid your place, they have either obtained or found a loophole around whatever permissions and protections that would otherwise keep them out. <br /><br />You could try flushing it, tossing it out the window, chucking it into an already-lit fireplace and so on, but if they are raiding you they are probably already anticipating that and have plans to intercept such things. As for shoving it up your ass or swallowing it, if they have permission (warrant or whatever local thing) to break into your house and look for drugs, said permission likely covers any small area capable of containing one dose of drugs. With drugs being as small as they are, that pretty much means anything. Including your ass. <br /><br />In my opinion, you are talking about a situation where you are already very, very fucked. Your best bet is to A) be very polite, sit where they tell you, call them &quot;sir/ma&#039;am,&quot; keep your hands visible, sit where they tell you and so on. No sarcasm, no namecalling, etc. Be as nice as possible and try really really hard not to piss them off. <br /><br />B) Politely, decline to comment about anything without a lawyer. If you are not in a country that has the legal right to keep your mouth shut, well, keep your mouth shut anyway. Don&#039;t be rude, but be very firm. &quot;I&#039;m terribly sorry, officer, but I really won&#039;t talk about this without a lawyer.&quot; <br /><br />C) When in doubt, remember rule B. <br /><br />D) If these other rules don&#039;t work, remember rule B anyway. <br /><br />E) If rule B doesn&#039;t work, it&#039;s because you forgot rule B. So go back to rule B. <br /><br /><br />If they kick your door down, they are gonna find your stuff. Your own words, however, are absolutely going to be more valuable to the prosecution. <br /><br />A good tip is to clean up and go to your local courthouse with the name of some guy you know got busted about 4 years ago. Go to the records office, and ask to see his court file. They will probably have it and in most countries it&#039;s a public record. Read it, see what that guy did wrong and learn from it. Then do that for a dozen other convicts. And post what you learn on the forums so other people can be safe too. <br /><br />:)

				You guys not familiar with the Wire? Not trying to be obnoxious but do you really think government agencies are going to spend resources &#039;guessing&#039; stuff is there?<br /><br />If they are raiding you they know you have stuff there, having an off site location won&#039;t help as they really are dedicated about catching you then they know those places as well. <br /><br />The damage is done in the stages that come before and even more likely someone informed them.

Just because they raid a house doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;ve been watching you for days/weeks, it takes a lot of resources to do that. I thought the biggest risk of being raided was when receiving packages which taking into consideration the nature of this forum is pretty common.<br /><br />Now, I want to start hiding my stash somewhere but I can&#039;t find a good place. Does anyone have any ideas? I can&#039;t think of a place that is, easily accessible, deserted, not too far, no risk of sudden buildings/flooding/etc. <br /><br />Digging is a pain, most places will always have the chance of people being nearby and if it&#039;s not completely safe I&#039;ll be paranoid that someone finds it. I just can&#039;t think of a good place, the forest is good but there&#039;s always a risk of someone walking their dog sees you digging and suspects something and digging in a forest is usually impossible as the ground is way too hard. So maybe just hiding it in the home somewhere really good? Yes I can think of a few places I could hide it where it probably wouldn&#039;t be found, although if they bring a dog it&#039;s over anyway. Then I had the idea of sacrificing a small amount of substance and just rubbing it EVERYWHERE and by everywhere I mean everywhere so the dog will signal that it smells something the whole time. But at the same time, doing that would just make them search even more until they find something. <br /><br />Anyone have any good ideas? :)<br /><br />

				Pelican boxes are extremely good for stashes, airtight, watertight, crush proof and available in a variety of small sizes. You can put what ever you want to stash in one of these and just hide it outside somewhere and it will never be found AND be in perfect condition when you recover it.

				A friend of ours personally lives surrounded by miles and miles of pure forest. She stores all her drugs, flash drives, scales, ect, in the rocky mountains surrounding her. Using a fake &quot;rock&quot; stash.<br /><br />A search warrant &quot;normally&quot; only covers a specific address, and she has nothing a K9-unit could &quot;hit&quot; on anyways if they chose to (most likely illegally) search for her stash with their dogs in the mountains surrounding her.<br /><br />She uses night vision goggles to check, before, in the middle of the night, retrieving &quot;anything&quot; incriminating she may want at any given time.<br /><br />This tactic only works if you live in a remote location obviously, but pretty sweet idea we feel, short of &quot;off-site&quot; storage.<br /><br />Especially if you are concerned about any &quot;long term&quot; stake out&#039;s. Any such attempts/investigations &#039;could&#039; theoretically be spotted using night vision goggles and daylight visual recon.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				A friend of mine was on a tour bus going from Holland into France. They got boarded by French police with a dog. My friend was at the back of the bus holding about an oz of good bud that even a human could sniff out. He had no time to do anything but put it under his jacket which was sitting on the seat . While he was bitchen and crying about loosing his passport in a despeate attempt to distract attention from the search&nbsp; the dog was being led all over the seats around his jacket and the dog was even made to climb on the seat on top of his jacket to sniff higher and never indicating to the police that the stash of weed or the puddle of pee by my friends feet. Now either that dog was dutch and working undercover or maybe he had a cold that day. I believe there was an overload of weed scent all thru that bus. I guess the moral of this story is dogs arent perfect and there must ways to fool them.

				I also had a &#039;bus&#039; experience in europe. Had a substantional amount of weed (which made me a LOT of friends later :)). Bus got checked somewhere along the former iron curtain border but luckily the dogs stayed outside. Just threw my stash a few seats in front. If they would&#039;ve found it there was no way they couldve known it was mine.<br /><br />Later though i was smoking outside some bar in a small village with my new friends hehe. Suddenly there was a cop in front of me, ofcourse he spotted the joint but his main concern where my travelling buddies who were drunk beyond imagination and causing a lot of trouble.<br /><br />Also another dog story, i used to fly a lot inside europe. And sometime you see this smaller dogs inside the airport which you won&#039;t immediately link to drugdogs. But somehow i always got the feeling they were indeed that. Undercover dogs&nbsp; ;)

				Keep all digital records on an encrypted flash drive and keep it somewhere hidden. If you&#039;re a vendor I would have a close friend rent a storage room and keep stuff hidden in there.

				A fireplace or similar furnace with the local controls disabled so guests can&#039;t turn it on and a remote ignition. Make sure the remote ignition requires a deliberate action and is always on hand, on your keychain, an app on your phone, can be activated by a quick dial from a phone, or whatever better you can think of for your life style.&nbsp; A 5-10 second ignition sequence should allow for enough complication to avoid accidental destruction and short enough to pull off by the time your face is smashed into the floor.&nbsp; There is still the possibility they discover your destruction and method and charge you for that but the odds are much slimmer and the charges almost certainly far less sever.<br /><br />You&#039;ll also need to be sure the stash isn&#039;t a visible anomaly within the burner and is encased in fast burning material.<br />

				This really only would work depending on your situation but, <br />Make it look like you&#039;re just a pot dealer <br /><br />Keep weed, scale, bags not very well hidden at all. Also, keep a vacuum sealer and vacuum rolls with this.<br />In another separate area, keep a nice stash of junk food- a nice mix including bags of chips. Stash your drugs in one of the snack bags, and seal it back up with the vacuum sealer. Keep a trash can nearby with some empty snack packaging. <br /><br />So hard to say what to do with your stash. Would really depend on your situation as a whole.

				You guys realize this thread has become a &quot;how to&quot; for LE writing and serving warrants, right? They now know all sorts of stuff to list in warrants (they have to list specific locations they think drugs would be in, but drugs are small so the &quot;specific place&quot; can be an entire house lot ... and the trees around it if they find NVGs since that is listed earlier in this thread). <br /><br />This is great information for all of us to have, but I promise you LE will find it just as useful.

				I would say the most common choice would be to flush it down the toilet but I would not have to do this as I only have like 1oz maximum and I don&#039;t have suspicious things like scales, baggies etc as if you have scales and baggies / aluminium foil with the weed then it&#039;s going to look like your dealing.
