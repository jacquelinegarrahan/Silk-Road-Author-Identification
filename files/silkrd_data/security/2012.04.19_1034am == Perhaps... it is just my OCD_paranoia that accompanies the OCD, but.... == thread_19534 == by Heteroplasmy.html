				....exactly how safe is the Silk Road and TOR these days?? I&#039;m not saying that finding/getting onto the Silk Road was SIMPLE... . I am just wondering, what genius working for the DEA can crack this TOR encryption eventually and potentially start catching Silk Road members and sellers??? This would be devastating to not only me, but an entire community of people trying to conduct a &quot;business&quot;. I honestly care about the integrity and health of the Silk Road and staying the &quot;Anonymous Market&quot;. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Heteroplasmy<br /><br />P.S. I am a newbie on here still in my humble opinion. I have made about 5 transactions so far and am still feeling my way around. I just don&#039;t want anything bad to EVER afflict Silk Road or it&#039;s members. I want our anonymity to remain intact indefintely. :)

				You don&#039;t have to worry about theoretical Tor snooping or PGP decryption more physical handling of drugs like picking it up safely or mailing it and storage without running into problems. If you&#039;re a promising student, don&#039;t be getting no drooogz sent to your school dorm or anything.

				tor is not 100% secure. in fact nothing is 100% secure.<br />by using something like tor, you just increase the amount of effort needed to break your anonymity.<br /><br />have a look into tor timing attacks. on the increase atm...

				you cant tell how many are registered now. before you could and you could tell how many transactions were made and you can roughly account for how much SR was making. now you cant. it will become more and more secure. TOR on the other hand will not be so secure. Your ISP can see you connecting to TOR.

You just freely gave everyone here information that is potentially enough to single you out, or at the very least reduce the list of suspects for being you to the double or single digits. Out of seven billion people on the planet, methinks that&#039;s a pretty big deal.<br /><br />Human error is the culprit every 999 times out of 1000 that someone gets caught for shady Internet deals. The technology is at fault only that other one time. So I&#039;d worry more about the former than the latter. Surely a smart cat like you will agree.
