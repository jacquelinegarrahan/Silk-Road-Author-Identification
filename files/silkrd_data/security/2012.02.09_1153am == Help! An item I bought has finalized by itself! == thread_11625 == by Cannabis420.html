				I bought an item which I may have to appeal as it doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s going to arrive has seemingly finalized by itself. The seller pulled the listing, presumably due to selling out (his page looks totally legit, I don&#039;t THINK he&#039;s a scammer) and now there is now no finalize or resolve option on my orders page, just a box to leave feedback. When I click on the item number it says the status of the order is finalized even though I never initiated this! <br /><br />Does this mean he has my money and there&#039;s nothing SR can do if it doesn&#039;t arrive??<br /><br />Has anyone else had anything like this?<br /><br />If this is unusual the mods might want to check their security.<br /><br />

				How long has it been since you ordered? Orders auto-finalize after 18 days of shipment.

				That&#039;s a pretty atypical occurrence. Are you really sure you didn&#039;t accidentally click the finalization button yourself? Rather ironically, the finalization button is final...

				Hey, not to trash anyone at all, but if you posted the vendor&#039;s name I&#039;m pretty sure members will vouch (or not) for him. How&#039;s all of his feedback? That should tell you something.

I&#039;m pretty sure you can&#039;t finalize without leaving feedback, correct me if I&#039;m wrong. I clearly think there has most likely been some error in SR that was prompted when his order was removed, but I don&#039;t really know. His feedback is bang on perfect as far as I can see though.<br /><br />

If anyone doesn&#039;t believe me about the feedback, I can post two screenshots proving it&#039;s auto-finalized very early. I got a response from SR support telling me my item had auto-finalized because I left it too long, so I sent a message back explaining. Waiting on a response.<br /><br />His prices are very good and he is very friendly, and has brilliant feedback, but I&#039;ve received nothing even though we both live in the UK and he sent it 1st class a week ago. He says he remembers doing my order and hasn&#039;t had any other problems with the post so far.

But hypothetically if he didn&#039;t would the SR team be able to do something? It&#039;s hardly my fault. I have been supporting both the sellers here and the SR team itself by spending a couple of hundred quid over the past couple of months since I discovered SR, which I would have otherwise given to my local scumbag dealers.<br /><br />Anyway for now, I&#039;ll just wait and see what SR support say when they respond to my message. Maybe even the package had been temporarily lost and is on its way now and I won&#039;t have to worry about this - the post will be here in an hour, but I am quite doubtful now.
