				Just an FYI for those on the road that use get-bitcoin.com to get your btc. I know their is an existing thread on this company and I also know that this specific topic (Chase branch deposits) has encountered sporadic interruptions in service. I personally have had flawless experiences with them, I like the&nbsp; quick turnaround and the reasonable fees. I usually got my coins through them in 4 hours or so.<br /><br />Today I placed an order on their website before leaving for work (early AM in the USA). After an 8 hour day at work, I swing through the drive thru teller at Chase to make a cash deposit to get-bitcoin (the way I always have in the past). After about a 5 minute delay, the teller says &quot;Mr. McCabe, you will need to come inside and speak to the bank manager. Your account is restricted and I am unable to make your deposit. Please drive around and come inside so we can discuss the matter further&quot;. (Uh, fuck no...and who the hell is Mr. McCabe???)&nbsp; I told them &quot;I was in a huge hurry and just to give me my cash back and I would be in bright and early in the AM to work it out&quot;.<br /><br />The &quot;Chase deposit&quot; option was gone from their site for a while, but then returned, which I was stoked about because it is easiest for me. Well, the option is gone again, apparently for good. Perhaps I was the final guinea pig. <br /><br />Now, off to go clean my soiled boxer shorts and think about my btc options. Hate this BS (fyi, I am a regular user with many SR transactions under my belt. This username is new for me because I am a paranoid mess right now).&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />

Perhaps. <br /><br />Does it, at a bare minimum,&nbsp; compromise an element of my personal security model? Absolutely.<br /><br />Fucking pisses me off because cust support is giving me nothing more than &quot;Sorry, beyond our control&quot; comments. I placed my order in the AM and went to the bank 8 hours later. If they knew Chase would reject, why didn&#039;t they send out an email to all Chase customers that had &quot;open orders&quot; in their system. Cust support said that didn&#039;t have the ability to do that. (Yet, they can send me an automated email when I place the order and when the btc lands in my wallet. They COULD have emailed me and saved me from going to the teller window and learning the hard way)

				Bitinstant &gt; Email.&nbsp; Use it while you can.<br /><br /><br />Edit : Fuck Chase.&nbsp; I think you can deposit with Bank of America for bitinstant, they are just as bad IMO, but they are struggling for cash, so I&#039;m guessing they will turn a blind eye for quite some time(Although this could be a bad thing, they could just run off with your $ at any time I suppose).&nbsp; Either way I wouldnt go back to THAT Chase branch ;).

Of course there are many many tools in place to protect everyone, but certainly we must rely on one another to exercise &quot;best practices&quot; to the greatest degree each of us can in our own little corners of SR. When any of us starts to get sloppy, the whole community could ultimately be jeopardized.<br /><br />I loved get-bitcoin because it was streamlined, cheap and fast. As a &quot;storefront&quot; btc exchange&nbsp; broker, I feel they serve a fiduciary responsibility to protect their clients from harm if they have knowledge that could protect a customer (not to mention an email system already in place to easily do so).<br /><br />We all assume risk, but all must work together to avoid the man. If a btc exchanger knew something was up at the bank and didn&#039;t let a customer know...but instead just let them keep on walking up to the teller like nothing was wrong? Ah, they will figure it out when the bank manager pulls him aside? That is bullshit!! In this age of instant information, I would be pissed too. <br /><br />What if you had a pending drug order on SR and your vendor got popped? Would you want the courtesy of an IM, email or something to give you a head&#039;s up? Similar context IMHO...<br /><br />-eb 8)<br /><br />

				I found this thread hysterical, if for nothing but the general and sustained paranoia of the OP. To Phil, I&#039;m sure it wasn&#039;t that funny but you should calm down and think this through rationally and you&#039;ll hopefully come to the reasonable conclusion this whole thing WASN&#039;T ABOUT YOU and you really have nothing to worry about.<br /><br />First, since they addressed you as Mr McCabe, that should tell you right off that this wasn&#039;t about you. They thought you were the get-bitcoin account owner rolling up to make a deposit. Second, since the link and service on chase&#039;s site has been down and service interrupted since this happened, that should have been confirmation that this really has nothing to do with you and instead the get-bitcoin bank account was flagged for legitimate purposes shortly before you attempted to make your deposit.<br /><br />When you have a high roller merchant account at any bank that&#039;s receiving daily transactions of hundreds of thousands of dollars like get-bitcoin probably did with a half million to million dollar reserve it maintains so it can max out on interest for each second each dollar sits in that account (or even a half mil to mil credit line to get through days when deposits are slow and withdrawals outpace deposits) banks are particularly customer friendly. It&#039;s not like you&#039;re some poor college kid opening an account with a couple hundred bucks liable to bounce your shit and not be worth their time. They roll out the red carpet of customer service and offer you all the perks and benefits.<br /><br />What it sounds like is the account was restricted or frozen due to suspicious activity that put the health of the account in jeopardy. Probably some social engineer or hacker figured out how to tap it which put mccabe under the margin of his minimum reserve or over his credit limit, causing it to be frozen and flagged to notify the account holder. Being a high roller account, sounds like the bank manager himself wanted to explain what was going on and give Mr McCabe a personal heads up once the teller reported that she had McCabe there trying to make a deposit.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it surprised them that you tore out of there in a huff, neglecting your high roller account while they were going out of their way to look after you. Ahahaha. The fact that the chase service hasn&#039;t been available confirms that there was some issue about keeping that account active. Maybe he pushed his limit too far and took out more than he was bringing in. Maybe the account and info got compromised in a way that couldn&#039;t be as easily resolved as just opening a new account for him. Maybe he got so pwned he&#039;s been taken for every cent.<br /><br />But rest assured it had nothing to do with you.<br /><br />
