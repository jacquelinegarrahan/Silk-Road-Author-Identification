				I did this once before when bitinstant got hacked and I was&nbsp; nervous about all sorts of stuff so I changed my BTC address before they transferred funds into my SR account. I wrote and told them, they asked me for the new/changed address and sent them to me no problem. <br /><br />I totally accidentally just did the same thing!! I went to change my BTC address BEFORE sending funds from localbitcoins and I thought that it had changed because I had two windows up and was looking at the wrong one...(I know I know)&nbsp; SOOO::::<br /><br />I sent my BTC from localbitcoins to a SR address that I had cancelled/changed moments before/during the sending process. <br /><br />I did copy and paste my OLD&nbsp; SR btc address into my backup BTC address in my settings but I have a feeling this is not going to help me. I did not touch/change my BTC address on localbitcoins<br /><br />What do I need to do?&nbsp; I know they aren&#039;t just going to float around out there and&nbsp; get stolen because people do stupid shit like I just did often. <br /><br />Will they get returned to my&nbsp; localbitcoins.com address after the one its trying to send to proves to be invalid? <br />Will they just sit in blockchain.info until I do something proactive about it?<br />Will they transfer into my backup BTC address that I entered into my account settings?? I wish there was a way to change my BTC address back to the old onc since I have the letters/digits for it but I don&#039;t think this is posible.<br /><br />Please help!!!!<br /><br />-Billy P.

				Yep. As I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve found out already, your old SR address still works. SR keeps a whole pool of your previous addresses around, and deposits into any one of them count as deposits towards your account. It&#039;s just a UI issue that they don&#039;t show you all of them at a time. They&#039;re also trying to encourage you to always use new addresses to obfuscate the blockchain transaction history.<br /><br />Also, bitcoins are never &quot;returned&quot; in a transaction. If an address is syntactically valid (even if no one has ever claimed the address), then the bitcoin network will accept a transaction to it.

				I&#039;ve done this a few times recently. I like to get a new bitcoin SR address each time. The last few times &quot;get new address&quot; seems to freeze, so I back out. I refresh my account page a few minutes later to make sure it hasn&#039;t changed, then copy paste the original address. When I go back to check, Lo and behold the address has now changed. This makes me slightly uneasy each time, but luckily I have read enough threads like this one to know they always show up just the same.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just out of interest though, are ALL the old addresses still functional and attached to my SR account.? Or am I slightly misunderstanding bitcoin? BTC is one of those things, like quantum physics, that I understand while I,m reading about it,but I kind of find hard to visualise. I read and re read....but if I try and explain to someone I&#039;m aware I&#039;m mangling it!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bit about how if someone transfers coin to an offline wallet, then a year later wants to spend coin, the block chain catches up, I always find confusing.....<br />.......I hate as I&#039;ve got older (I&#039;m quite old) I&#039;ve definitely lost intelligence. As a teenager I was really good at maths and would have definitely had no trouble understanding. But I went off the rails and now after years of drug abuse and several heroin overdoses and much other varied bad shit I am aware that my brain just isn&#039;t functioning like it once did. So often I reach for a word that I know exists and it isn&#039;t there....like an empty place on the shelf or a 404 error.<br />&quot;Sorry the neuron that held this information has been destroyed&quot;

				As a piece of advice guys you shouldn&#039;t keep your coins on your SR account or ANY ONLINE WALLET. If SR or one of these online wallets suddenly disappears, and it has happened with bitcoins, you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />I recommend a client like Electrum for use on your computer. Only transfers coins to SR when making a purchase.<br /><br />Cheers guys!<br />Blaze

				Hungry ghost, yes, all of your old addresses are still functional.<br /><br />And an offline wallet doesn&#039;t mean anything, except that you store the private keys to your bitcoin addresses offline, on a USB stick or printed on paper, or on some other object that is incapable of computer networking by itself. The block chain doesn&#039;t know the difference between an offline/online address, they are all just addresses with certain balances in the ledger.

				I think everyone get&#039;s a chunk of addresses. I always renew my address... Last time I did it I went to send the coins with my QT wallet and that same address was already used by me to send coins to SR... <br /><br />
