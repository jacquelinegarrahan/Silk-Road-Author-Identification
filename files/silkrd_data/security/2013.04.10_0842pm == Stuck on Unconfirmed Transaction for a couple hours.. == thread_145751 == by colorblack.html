				I&#039;m not very well versed on how the blockchain/confirmations actually work. I sent a few grand in coin from one wallet (blockchain) to another (coinbase) a few hours ago... yet I have yet to see even 1 confirmation. In fact, its been stuck on &quot;Unconfirmed Transaction&quot; for about 2.5 hours. What does this mean exactly? That the transaction has a lower priority then all the other trades on the blockchain and is just placed in quue? Or is something fucked up on the receiving (Coinbase) end? Any insight?

				ditto! in the same situation as you are too... has been unconfirmed for a few hours! they only reason i can think of is that so many people are trying to sell or buy at the same time it could be causing a fork in the blockchain.&nbsp; <br /><br />if anyone can shed some light as to why bitcoin transactions stay unconfirmed for a long time will be greatly appreciated!

				mine too..&nbsp; about noon Mountain time.&nbsp; i moved a few btc to SR cause I had noticed a difference this morning in total value having split the same amount in 2 different wallets.&nbsp; thinking i was getting less rate at blockchain than i was @ SR.&nbsp; only to figure later that blockchains BTC price was updated sooner than SR was.

				Update.. both transactions of mine showed up after being stuck on unconfirmed. Both STILL say unconfirmed. So damn weird. It wasn&#039;t much, maybe 3.5k total, but definetly had me cringing for a few hours. Ah well. Today has been a cringe worthy day. Worry not friends, we&#039;re bouncing back and will be hovering around 200 within 5 hours or so.
