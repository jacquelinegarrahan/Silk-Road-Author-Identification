				I am considering investing some money in bitcoins before the forbes article about SR and D.P.R gets published in early september. Many people seem to think that this major magazine article will put SR in the spotlight, and, as a result, the price of BTC will explode. This seems like a logical chain of events to me, although I am a little nervous, seeing as how BTC has constantly jumped up and down within the past couple months. What do you guys think? Could the release of the forbes article end up having the reverse effect, such as world governments banning the use of BTC, tor, etc? surely something like this would cause BTC to drop steadily

				BTC has already been covered by major news outlets. I don&#039;t see the article effecting the price.

				that may be true, although i am still constantly meeting people who have no idea what bitcoins are, or what SR is. Also, most news outlets tend to put SR in a negative light, whereas the forbes article is extremely positive about D.P.R and the idea of a &quot;free market&quot;. Although, i don&#039;t picture the type of people that read forbes being the type of people who would come on here and buy drugs. cokehead wall street traders maybe. The article could draw a lot of potential investors though, which would raise the BTC price, seeing as forbes is primarily a business related magazine.

				Understandable. The article doesnt touch on Bitcoins much though. I&#039;m always hoping the price of BTC goes up too, but i just dont see this article doing that. I guess we will have to wait and see<br /><br />Also, The USA Senate just opened an investigation into BTC and sent subpenas to 22 different bitcoin companies. Nobody is quite sure what that means for Bitcoin right now but i doubt that it will help inflate the price.

				I don&#039;t think that the article will cause people to buy btc as an investment, yet it will bring additional buyers to the SR and that demand in itself will probably help push the price higher for the btc.<br /><br />IMHO

				now that bitcoins are considered a currency in the us (or at least that judge ruled they are), there should be more people interested in them, so whether it be SR or investment bankers who push the price up, the price should start to climb again.
