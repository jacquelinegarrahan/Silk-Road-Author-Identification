				Used Bitinstant&#039;s bitcoin to email via Walmart and made a mistake. Bitinstant now requires a full name and birthdate, I used a fake one, BUT DID NOT use the same name on the blue moneygram form. When the Walmart employee started punching in the numbers, name and address an error popped up stating that the last name did not match (she turned the screen so I could see) resulting in a unsuccessful transaction. I did not want to say OH try Smith :) .......Just a heads up! I&#039;ll try again tomorrow. &gt;:(

				Yeah, my local CVS does it too now. Guess they&#039;ve been doing it ever since Bitinstant started asking for your name. You can still use fake info tho.

				Just use fake info, but yes, make sure the Bitinstant fake info matches what you fill out on the Moneygram form. I&#039;ve done this 2x this week with no problems.

				What about phone numbers? Because today I did 3 transactions at the same time at Walmart one with all my real info, one with my friends real info but fake phone number, and third with another friends real info but fake phone number....when at Walmart the 2 friends forms had made up phone numbers different then the ones entered online because I forgot...only one has come through to my instawallet so now I have $1000 floating around.<br /><br />What do I do?!

				The phone number just needs to match what you entered on the online form. Personally I would use all fake info, they do not check for ID. I don&#039;t know what to tell you about the missing coins, but the receipt should have a transaction ID or confirmation number, I think you can contact Bitinstant with these details for support.

				I&#039;m surprised they were able to complete the order if the info didn&#039;t match. Sorry I don&#039;t know who to contact but I would start with Bitinstant support.
