				Hello...I have-finally-come to a point where I have bought bitcoins from mt.gox and need to transfer the money to my SR account...easier said than done. The current feel is that blockchain.info works, so I wanted to use them as my starting point, then bitcoinfog, then SR. Being new, I know nothing about e-wallets, or what is involved..and the threads/posts I have read in here up until now has left me rather gloomy.<br /><br />Now I went to blockchain and said &quot;login to my wallet&quot; and the next screen that came up said &quot;This website (blockchain.info) is asking to store data on your computer for offline use, with the choices &quot;Allow&quot;, &quot;Never for this site&quot;, and &quot;Not now&quot;. As one becomes overly paranoid as one reads these forums, I turned into the proverbial deer stuck in the headlights and am desperate for help.<br /><br />What do I do?

				Hmm, not really familiar with Mt. Gox method of purchasing bitcoins, but since you already got that out of the way. I also have never used a blockchain wallet, but I assume it works the same way as an Instawallet.<br /><br />I think you are just being over-protective and that means really nothing. If I were in your situation I would press &quot;Never for this site&quot; or &quot;Not now&quot;. Why would you want your computer storing soon-to-be illegal activities to your computer for offline viewing?<br /><br />You might also be able to just send from Mt. Gox to an instawallet, then instawallet to bitcoin fog. Same deal as what you are doing now, just will alleviate the problem you are having.<br /><br />Since you used Mt. Gox, I would say it&#039;s safe to say YOU SHOULD USE A TUMBLER! Since Mt. Gox flags everybody using Tor, so you must be unprotected from a computer that isn&#039;t yours to be anonymous.<br /><br />If you live in a country that lets you, next time, do Bitinstant&gt;instawallet&gt;fog&gt;SR, or you can cut out the fog and do Bitinstant&gt;instawallet&gt;SR.

				Thanks for the help Slugger, it is appreciated.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading about instawallet and seems they had a glitch like 10 days ago but apparently it&#039;s fixed now so maybe if I do:<br /><br />Mt.gox &gt; instawallet &gt; SR, I will be good. <br /><br />or maybe,<br /><br />Mt.gox &gt; instawallet &gt; bitcoinfog&gt; SR will be better...<br /><br />Fuck I SO hate being new to anything!

				I use it just fine, it wants to store info because that&#039;s the kind of webpage they use. They want to store your BTC balance and transactions so you don&#039;t need to reload the page. just say no and don&#039;t allow it, it&#039;s a legit site.<br /><br />Transfered about $140 over it and my btc didn&#039;t disappear so I&#039;m gonna assume it&#039;s fine. Rather than use bitcoinfog, just anonymitize your transaction on blockchain
