				Dear all,<br /><br />Those of you lucky enough to live in a jurisdiction where an innocent citizen doesn&#039;t have to hand over their passwords or face prison time may or may not be familiar with the Cold Boot Attack :<br /><br />https://citp.princeton.edu/research/memory/<br /><br />For those that don&#039;t know, in simplest terms, this type of attack is a way of decrypting the contents of a person&#039;s hard drive when they have used a program like Truecrypt or PGP disk to protect it. <br /><br />The attack exploits what is known as &quot;memory persistence&quot; in a computer&#039;s RAM chips whereby data is not erased immediately when a computer is powered down but lingers for a number of minutes (this can be extended if equipment is used to cool down the computer).<br /><br />I&#039;ll let Princeton University explain the rest:<br /><br />&quot;Although DRAMs become less reliable when they are not refreshed, they are not immediately erased, and their contents persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access. We use cold reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems — BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt — using no special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several strategies for partially mitigating these risks, we know of no simple remedy that would eliminate them.&quot;<br /><br />None of this is to suggest that using full disk encryption (FDE) is futile but this is a serious vulnerability and it&#039;s one you may not know about if you use FDE.<br /><br />The likelihood of you being caught solely on the basis of the Police bursting down your door, spraying your laptop with liquid nitrogen and retrieving your encryption key is low but it&#039;s not a risk that can be ignored entirely so I have started this thread in order for us to discuss ways we can protect ourselves against this kind of attack.<br /><br />My two cents for what they&#039;re worth(!):<br /><br /><br />==Shutting down your PC when you&#039;re not using it!==<br /><br />Most modern laptops and computers have a &quot;hibernate&quot; mode - this is not nearly as safe as cleanly shutting down the machine as the computer&#039;s suspended state is stored in your RAM memory&nbsp; -including your encryption keys. At the very least you should dismount any encrypted containers/drives when you suspend the machine.<br /><br />==Good Physical Security==<br /><br />The data only lingers in RAM Chips for a short time. Even a delay of a minute or so could make the difference in this kind of attack. In an idea world you&#039;d have a wire fence, several locked doors and steel safe in between your laptop and government grunts but the rest of us have to be more pragmatic. Locking your door is probably a good first step - this also prevents the &quot;evil maid&quot; attack whereby someone can install malicious software on your computer to record your password as you enter it.<br /><br />==Storing the Encryption Keys elsewhere besides in RAM==<br /><br />For the technically minded amongst us it might be possible to install your Bootloader and possibly some keyfiles to a USB stick which would make it more difficult to perform a Cold Boot attack although I do not think this would provide an absolute defence.<br /><br />I have also been able to find a patch for the Linux Kernel named TRESOR which keeps encryption keys in your CPU, not the RAM. You can download it from : http://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/tresor<br /><br />This isn&#039;t for noobs as it involves modifying the Linux Kernel. Sad to say unless your processor supports encrypted devices, you&#039;re stuck with using 128 Bit encryption which isn&#039;t very secure. I&#039;d be interested to hear some of our security gurus thoughts on this workaround.<br /><br />Any other suggestions/comments would be most welcome.<br /><br />V.

				If you need to access SR. Boot from a ramdisk or USB, then 0-fill the drive when you are done.&nbsp; There are several utilities around that 0-fill, basically they write and re-write every sector (MBR and sector 0) enough times to make data irretrievable.&nbsp; An old DOS based version of Norton disk-doctor floating around is the best 0-fill utility going around, but you need a floppy drive to use it. It&#039;s the best because you can specify the number of writes.<br /><br />Yes it&#039;s a PITA to re-install Tor and a lite linux and AES-twofish encrypt it every time, and the 0-fill takes about 2 hours on a 1gb drive, so its not something you can do in an emergency situation, but it may save your freedom if not your life.<br /><br />CC

				A tails shutdown only takes about 15-20 seconds, from my observations, so if it does overwrite the RAM properly, this should be an adequate defense against this kind of attack.<br /><br />Even if this ever does become common practice, I can&#039;t see LE having a guy with a can of liquid nitrogen taking point on a raid.

				Not at all mate, all security stuff deserves a mention.&nbsp; I rushed my last post due to distractions, so it may have sounded more dismissive than I intended it to.&nbsp; What I meant was that the 15-20 second shutdown time of Tails should give adequate time to thwart the attack, since I doubt LE would rush the tech guys in first on a raid.

				It isn&#039;t that low risk, specialized police do cold boot attacks all the time.<br /><br />http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10641927<br /><br />hm there was a news article not that long ago where police were talking about internet drug scene using encryption, and how they are starting to train agents to get memory while it is still live, but I can&#039;t find it right now. They talked about several of their tactics for getting to encryption keys in memory though. <br /><br />www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/219941.pdf<br /><br />there is a LE guide for first responders on how to deal with memory in ways that maximize the chance of obtaining encryption keys

				Also some other points:<br /><br />A. They don&#039;t need to carry in a vat of liquid nitrogen they just need a can of compressed air held upside down<br /><br />B. 128 bit encryption is very secure, most algorithms are designed for 128 bit security in the first place and then extended to 256. In some cases 128 is even more secure than 256 due to issues that arise with the key scheduling of 256 bits. 256 is more quantum resistant though. A classical computer is not going to pwn 128 bit any time soon though.<br /><br />C. The best defense from a cold boot attack is to encapsulate the memory in some material that needs to be removed before they can dump it in a forensics laptop, and use chassis intrusion detection hardware that immediately shuts down into a memory wipe when they case is opened<br /><br />D. If you are identified in the first place you are relying on your attacker being retarded, there are a billion ways to steal passphrases and keys and FDE is only going to protect you if your attacker doesn&#039;t know what they are doing&nbsp;

Your strongest defence is anonymity -- FDE is only a fallback measure, if your primary defence, anonymity, happens to fail. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24330.msg256609#msg256609">Quote from: vlad1m1r on May 24, 2012, 03:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">My two cents for what they&#039;re worth(!):<br /><br />==Shutting down your PC when you&#039;re not using it!==<br /><br />Most modern laptops and computers have a &quot;hibernate&quot; mode - this is not nearly as safe as cleanly shutting down the machine as the computer&#039;s suspended state is stored in your RAM memory&nbsp; -including your encryption keys. At the very least you should dismount any encrypted containers/drives when you suspend the machine. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed. It is always a good rule of thumb to NEVER hibernate your machine if you have anything sensitive on it. Always dismount your encrypted drives, then shut the machine down. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24330.msg256609#msg256609">Quote from: vlad1m1r on May 24, 2012, 03:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />==Good Physical Security==<br /><br />The data only lingers in RAM Chips for a short time. Even a delay of a minute or so could make the difference in this kind of attack. In an ideal world you&#039;d have a wire fence, several locked doors and steel safe in between your laptop and government grunts but the rest of us have to be more pragmatic. Locking your door is probably a good first step - this also prevents the &quot;evil maid&quot; attack whereby someone can install malicious software on your computer to record your password as you enter it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Data remanence typically lasts only about ten minutes at room temperature. In an emergency, given that shutting-down takes a few minutes that you might not have, what you might do is restart the machine by hitting the reset button; if your BIOS is set so as to self-test the RAM chips on system startup, this will help to destroy the contents.

Sad to say unless your processor supports encrypted devices, you&#039;re stuck with using 128 Bit encryption which isn&#039;t very secure.

I suggested using a Yubikey as a blind a few months ago for this purpose - I suppose its success would depend on how much time it bought you - leaving the dummy card prominently beside your computer might waste precious minutes.<br /><br />With regard to TRESOR, I am very excited about the possibility of a patch which stores encryption keys in the CPU not the RAM. It doesn&#039;t concern me at all that it&#039;s for an older version of the linux kernel, nor that it uses 128 Bit encryption but I thought it might concern people in the know - I wonder if this were applied to a USB installation of a debian based distro like TAILS if it would increase one&#039;s security? As you can see UKGrower has said that TAILS automatically begins to purge the RAM when the corresponding USB stick / DVD is removed.<br /><br />I am a member of the Linux Forensics group on Yahoo (I used to run a small home based business to help people recover their deleted / encrypted files) and I did see a post the other day about a hard drive that had been seized from an Ubuntu user whose home folder had been encrypted using 128 Bit AES - most posters did say that there wasn&#039;t much to be done about retrieving files allegedly saved to his download folder (the man&#039;s partner had apparently seen him do this), but a couple of posters said it was viable to crack 128 bit encryption - it seems from what you say they were talking through their hats, so many thanks for setting me straight!<br /><br />You&#039;ll see below I say that dismounting encrypted Truecrypt *volumes* in fact does purge the encryption keys from memory to the best of my knowledge. For this reason I keep my Tor Browser / GPG software in a separate Truecrypt container inside an encrypted partition. I&#039;d very much appreciate your thoughts on this as I don&#039;t want to give faux advice!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

He should have had his doors and windows hooked up to an alarm system and configured his PC to shut down into a memory wipe as soon as a breach was detected.&nbsp; This is merely one case of police pwning someone with FDE, there are other cases where they actually did cold boot attack after the suspect had managed to shut down his computer, but not enough time had passed for the RAM to clear. You probably will not have anywhere near a minute after your door is battered down, LE can get access to the blueprints of your house and use various techniques to guess the room that your PC is in, so they pretty much know exactly where to go. Also they have adrenaline pumping and are going full speed and the door will be on the ground when the front runners hit it the first time if they use a battering ram and then the rest of the team can just keep running full speed into the home and to the location they are trying to get to. five to ten seconds after you hear the door hitting the floor is a more realistic amount of time imo.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				properly done CCTV might be good for protecting from a sneak and peak keylogger being covertly installed, but that just knocks down the number of ways they can steal your encryption keys from 1,000,0000 to 999,999. You could have your house all set up with alarm systems and CCTV and have memory in encapsulation material and sit on a dead mans switch that wipes ram when the pressure is off of it and have a chassis with intrusion detection that wipes RAM when the case is opened and use an on screen keyboard and always work out of your basement with a laptop running off of battery in the hopes that it will shield adequately from a TEMPEST attack. That will make stealing your passphrase pretty difficult, but would be much more beneficial if you were hiding a bunch of CP versus trying to hide the fact that you are selling drugs.

				I doubt you&#039;ll ever get TEMPEST or acoustic signature experts trying to steal your pass unless you&#039;re Al Qaeda or other target for the US military.&nbsp; Different keyboards and/or laptop have different emission characteristics (both acoustic and EM) and real world attempts to do a remote keylog would likely have a very low probability of success.&nbsp; Also, such hardware is not generally made available to law enforcement because the US military doesn&#039;t want it falling into the hands of other countries intelligence agencies.<br /><br />RAM readers ARE available though... and an important thing to remember is that you don&#039;t have to get your computer ram zeroized, just get it shut down quickly.&nbsp; If you suspect there&#039;s cops going to break your door down just pull the plug, this will instantly power you off and from that point the clock is ticking.<br /><br />Best case scenario you have a laptop or tablet with no removable RAM.... shut down, problem solved.<br /><br />Some removable RAM will persist for quite a while, so flipping the switch won&#039;t help much if they come prepared to pull the ram and dump it to their machine.&nbsp; In this case you&#039;re best off ensuring they can&#039;t easily get that RAM out.&nbsp; They&#039;ll shit their pants when they open your computer only to discover that you epoxied your ram sticks in.&nbsp; This is doable and is commonly done on COTS hardware operating in high-vibration environments.&nbsp; <br /><br />a good bet for Epoxy is Hysol EA9394 or EA9686, thoroughly clean the pins and connectors with a toothbrush and IPA.&nbsp; Dry with a heat gun on low heat, Coat the pins and connectors with epoxy, install the RAM, wiggle it back and forth and seat it well, then slowly apply heat and cure the epoxy at about 90C.....&nbsp; Hot cures make it much much stronger.&nbsp; Once it&#039;s cured nobody can pull that ram without causing damage to the delicate pins &amp; traces.<br /><br />The best epoxys will bond well to metals and to composites (fiberglass).&nbsp; If you can&#039;t find those aerospace types use the loctite plastic bond commercial epoxy.<br /><br />None of this works if you leave your machine powered on, lock it, and walk away... but a power relay from ebay tied into a magnetic door switch can be configured to shut the computer off every time someone walks into the room... the trick is how do you keep it from resetting the machine every time YOU open the door.&nbsp; There are a variety of cheap-o ways to do that, unlabeled wall switches to enable/disable your system, or a smart arrangement of magnetic door switch(s) that you can bypass with a small handheld magnet.&nbsp; Or many other circumventions.&nbsp; That&#039;s the sort of thing nobody would expect (till they read this post).<br /><br />Here&#039;s an idea, You guys know what a mercury switch or &quot;mercury tilt switch&quot; is???&nbsp; I&#039;d bet you young kids don&#039;t&nbsp; But all the old-timers out there have probably seen them inside the old style thermostats for home furnaces.&nbsp; go google it..&nbsp; Stick one of these in your desktop to cut the power if it&#039;s moved.... Just don&#039;t break it.&nbsp; Mercury switch + epoxy = problem solved.<br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br />Bob

Thanks for the information. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Lain<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Lain,<br /><br />Thank you for your kind words. <br /><br />As you&#039;ll see from the posts above, there&#039;s unfortunately no one, simple solution to this problem.<br /><br />I&#039;ve posted a link to Bruce Schneier&#039;s latest book &quot;Liars and Outliers&quot; in another thread, which talks about the issues of trust in society and how we use a number of methods to discourage defectors (outliers) - not all of whom of course are criminal. See what he has to say on issues like this:<br /><br />&quot;...There&#039;s one more problem: defenders are in what military strategist Carl von Clausewitz calls &quot;the position of the interior.&quot; They have to defend against every possible attack, while the defector only has to find one flaw that allows one way through the defenses. As systems get more complicated due to technology, more attacks become possible. This means defectors have a first-mover advantage; they get to try the new attack first.&quot;<br /><br />This summarises nicely the general sentiment I&#039;ve seen so far in the thread. There are any number of possible defences against the cold boot attack but there are also any number of ways one of them can be overcome.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t make encryption useless - nor is your number necessarily up the instant the Police batten down your doors, it&#039;s just important to make sure you employ layers of security to try to make sure this doesn&#039;t become an issue in the first place. In the above example, the man in question accessed an IRC channel from a non Torified connection which may well have been all that was necessary to trace him to his home address.<br /><br />I also mentioned poor physical security but as you&#039;ll see more experienced posters have mentioned that even if he&#039;d had time to shut down his computer before the door was broken down, there would still be enough data remaining in RAM to make a cold boot attack possible, as LEO are trained to knock down locked doors and enter property very quickly.<br /><br />Based on the links I posted above it would seem to take around ten minutes for data like encryption keys to fade irretrievably into RAM so if you can find a way to be certain you could shut down your machine and stop anyone from accessing it for at least that amount of time, please do share it with us!<br /><br />It&#039;s also worth noting the other comments above, saying that there are other ways for the Police to obtain your passwords through coercion by resorting to legislation such as RIPA in the UK, through monitoring EM transmissions from your keyboard and also installing a modified bootloader on your computer to record your password as you type. <br /><br />In any case, many thanks to everyone for your comments, I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll have some food for thought.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />
