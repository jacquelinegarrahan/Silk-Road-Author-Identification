				I would definitely want to be using TOR while doing a Bitinstant transaction. It&#039;s your protection. I&#039;m not sure about public wifi alone, you will still be able to be traced to your computer. I had a problem using bitinstant on TOR when I was getting my BTC. I would put all the info in, click next, and it would load a &quot;404 page not found&quot; page. I went on a different computer on clearnet, went to bitinstant and tried some bullshit and it worked, so when I tried it on a new identity, it worked.<br /><br />I got it to work twice doing the clearnet thing.

Can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t think of that. Probably because I had a similar problem, and I don&#039;t recall Javascript being the savior. Hell, maybe it was, mind may be a little foggy for the time being! Glad you poked in though, +karma.

				BitInstant&#039;s Trustcash site takes a few minutes to load on the tor network because the trustcash website tries to automatically track you on their map service. The application can take several minutes to load because it is trying to figure out your location (which it can&#039;t do because you&#039;re browsing anonymously with tor). If you would just be patient and let the page load for 4-5 minutes, everything will load fine and it will ask you to enter your Country and city so that you can get a nice list of banks/deposit locations and a google map for directions to the closest one. <br /><br /><br />

What if LE subpoena bitinstant for all transactions that were generated from a tor exit-node, and for the locations that were used to make the deposits, then subpoena&#039;d the banks for the security camera feeds at the time of the deposit?<br />===CONJECTURE===<br />

				No offense, but who cares if its suspicious when it&#039;s completely legal? Using tor is completely legal. Buying BTC is completely legal. Doing both, using a legal service is also completely legal. So even considering your idea that LE busts BitInstant, swipes all their transaction data, and finds out I bought $40 worth of coin. Then what? All I&#039;ve done is exchange currency and that&#039;s not illegal. <br /><br />You only run into problems if you&#039;re not keeping your coins secured and clean. <br /><br /><br />But lets just say I&#039;m dumb and I got BitInstant &gt; Ewallet &gt; SR wallet. LE&nbsp; busts BitInstant and starts following address of the BTC I deposited.&nbsp; If they see that the BTC has moved from one address to another, I can just plead my case that I paid someone $40 in BTC to tutor me over skype or some other bullshit service. All LE is going to know is that I bought coin, and moved it from one wallet (mine) to another (someone else&#039;s) in exchange for a completely legal online service. Am I wrong in this line of thinking??

				Has anyone ever gotten busted by LE following the coins alone?? I&#039;m no expert but I highly doubt they could, please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				Bitinstant has been hosed up for a couple of weeks now.&nbsp; Talking out of my ass:&nbsp; I think they&#039;re going thru some major growing pains (been there, done that as a biz owner) and now they&#039;re trying to launch a debit card.&nbsp; They are not really answering their phones and barely answering email, I hope they get things sorted and that they hire some more fucking help (do you hear me, Charlie the CEO of Instabit?).&nbsp; Not talking out of my ass:&nbsp; I mix it up when it comes to using bitcoin - I spend bitcoin for ordinary, everyday purchases like soap and I sometimes use bitcoin for illegal activities...
