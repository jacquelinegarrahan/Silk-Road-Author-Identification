				With bank deposits about a day, but I don&#039;t recommend using them. They are pretty sketchy and never honor the 24 hour guarantee, it will usually take a bit longer and they charge the service fee anyway. There is no reason to wait 24 hours for coins anyway, plenty of other quality services that do it in less than an hour

				I have used get-bitcoin a total of three times. The first two I had my coins within 3 hours of making my deposit at the bank. The third time I waited 20 hours for them to finally arrive. I used to use a tormail account for my orders but they no longer recommend that, stating that your email will probably end up in their spam folder and its not their fault. This alone is enough of a reason for me to stay away in the future. I did use the same fake name for all three orders, so I&#039;m going to try them one more time with a new name to see if I&#039;ll get the same 3 hour return and that they slow down for repeat/reused names. <br /><br />Just my experience.

				I sent my money order in the mail last Wednesday. they (GetBitCoin.com) have kept with good communication but I am still waiting. I thought it would be good considering they cost what the market price is and take a 5% fee from your bit coin total. Reflecting back I&#039;m thinking that it might be worth it to give 6 bucks a coin to a reputable vendor here at Silk Road to be able to get them within the hour or at least within the day. UnderGroundSydacate has good feedback on this subject

				I&#039;ve never had a problem with them.&nbsp; In fact, I use them exclusively.&nbsp; Long wait was on a Saturday - still less than 4 hours.&nbsp; Never thought much about the &quot;fee.&quot;

				Ive had good success with them on 2 cash deposits at the bank. I had my coins within 8-10 hours, but it didn&#039;t seem that long to me, and I got an email when they were sent.&nbsp; 8)<br />The 5% fee isn&#039;t too bad, otherwise you&#039;d have to get a legit account and buy at market prices. (or get friends to do that for you&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; )

				Get-Bitcoin sucks!!! Somethings wrong when your more nervous about whether or not you will receive your coins then if your ILLEGAL SCHEDULED SUBSTANCES will show up on your DOORSTEP lmao! The first couple times I used them it only took about a day r two to process my order from the time of receiving my letter in the mail (I use prepaid debit cards, you have to physically send them. Also the fee is jacked up to 8%.), the last time I used them (about a 10 days ago) my letter arrived (I purchased DCN) 5/04/2012, it was sent 5/02/2012, and they FINALLY got around to it after the many emails I sent to there ONE person support staff (FUCK YOU HANNAH) it was 5/08/2012. No bullshit, it took them 4 days to process my order!!! 24-Hour turnaround guarantee my ASS! In the whole time I have been using Get-Bitcoin (Basically for the lack of other sites that accept prepaid Visa debit) they have only completed my order in a reasonable time twice...They actually told me that USPS lies about when they deliver items and that it&#039;s not there fault whatsoever. I have yet to receive a refund of fee&#039;s from any of the times they have taken longer than 24-Hours. And I&#039;m a reasonable person, if it was once or twice I could of cared less. But like I said before, when it gets to the point where you get anxiety about whether or not they will credit your coins...<br /><br />Funny how things work out. I remember back when reading on these exact forums about how good Get-Bitcoin is and how quick they are, myself included (I know I reviewed them after my first order and it was literally the exact opposite of this review lol). Even now reading the forums and even this thread, the whole attitude towards them has changed. <br /><br />I can only speak about using prepaid Visa Debit Cards to purchase the coins, I have not used any other of the options on there site. And I will not be using them, after this last experience I swore to myself that I would never use there site again no matter what.<br /><br />Fuck Get-Bitcoin.com, the dudes raking in the money charging a base fee of 5% and can&#039;t even run a quality business. I&#039;m waiting for the day when whoever runs that site dips out with all the money from all the orders he&#039;s getting and just disappears. They try to sound official with the LLC, I can buy one of those for $500, all that means is the you cannot sue them for any reasons. Releases them from liability.
