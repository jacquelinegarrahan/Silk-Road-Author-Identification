This code must be emailed/PM&#039;ed back to me to confirm full receipt. I can then ship confident that the bulk shipment is likely to go through.

Also... I am thinking in terms of credibility on the forums and S.R. It seems like if a vendor stays in escrow and has DCNs it highly unlikely someone will be subject to criticism of being a scammer. I&#039;m looking for ways to transact business that make the *reputation* bulletproof, not so much an absolute certainty of successful receipt (which is what registered mail or a signature required would do and is frankly out of the question cause of LE issues).<br />&nbsp; Religious people have a saying &quot;Avoid even the APPEARANCE of evil&quot;. The more layers of likelyhood the better the trust from all concerned.<br />&nbsp; I have shipped product via mail requiring a signature (I stress this was at the receiver&#039;s INSISTENCE.. they wanted to be sure they got it) which worked good.. but that was on the front and didn&#039;t work out well longterm (cause of payment issues).

				&nbsp; &nbsp; Excellent idea. It would be hard to prove to SR that the buyer received the package if staff gets involved, but at the very least it would give vendor some insight about whether a buyer might be scamming them.
