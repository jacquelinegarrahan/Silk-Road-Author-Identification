				Yesterday I used bitinstant to send money from Walmart to my SR bitcoin address. I received a confirmation email <br />shortly after saying that the transaction had been completed, but when I looked at my SR account it still had nothing in it.<br />I decided to wait 24 hours to see if the bitcoins might still transfer, but nothing has happened up to this point. Does anyone <br />know why this happened, or what steps I might take now to get my bitcoins to show up????

				If you sent them directly to your SR wallet thru Bitinstant then you might have gotten a Mt. Gox voucher where you would have to get the coins thru Mt. Gox. but just check that email and see. If you didn&#039;t get one they should go straight thru. It usually takes some time..

				Alright thank you guys for the reassurance, this is my first time actually becoming active in the SR community so naturally I am extremely nervous and suspicious.

Dwolla requires ID and a bank account, no? With Bitinstant you can use all fake information and have the coins in your wallet in an hour. If I&#039;m buying $500 in btc I have no issue spending an extra $20 for Bitinstant.

				There is nothing illegal about buying/selling bitcoins. If you&#039;re in the federal cross hairs to the point that they&#039;re looking at your block chains, direct bank transfers are the least of your worries.<br /><br />Once you have bitcoins, you can launder them to and from SR, but using dwolla and MTGOX is as safe as can be so long as your coins are clean coming in.<br /><br />Also, just because they require ID doesn&#039;t mean it has to be YOUR ID, you just need some papers that will pass basic checks and an account in the name of the person you&#039;re claiming to be. <br /><br /><br />

				If you have legitimate bitcoin uses dwolla/MTGox seems like a good setup to have.&nbsp; Easy, don&#039;t have to even leave your house, but the dwolla transfers from your bank dwolla do take some time.<br /><br />After that just mix/tumble the coins when transferring out of Mtgox, which usually costs 1-3% into SR (or free with instawallet).<br /><br />Much less then the 10% bitcoin fees I hear bitinstant charges for direct bitcoins?????&nbsp; <br /><br />Another vendor http://www.bitcopia.com/ seems to get good reviews here, they use Wells Fargo bank for free pay-ins.&nbsp; Though I hear they are about 10% too.&nbsp; Though really easy if you have a wells fargo bank account, use atm, walk in and bill pay with cash, then straight to SR.
