				I feel kinda silly being a member of this site for a while and still not know the answer to this question.<br />Is it safe, wise, etc to open up a non tor Mozilla separately while your are also using a Tor enabled window.<br /><br />This goes anywhere from checking emails while on SR to watching a YouTube video, thanks for your guys&#039; time and input.<br /><br />dr34d

				it&#039;s perfectly safe unless you use the anonymous and non-anonymous browser to visit the same site at the same time , in which case it presents a risk of a correlation in stream breaking if your internet goes down

It has been shown that if 1 student has a &#039;stupid question&#039;, then there&#039;s about four or five others in the class also were thinking it.<br /><br />So; the answer is no. With some caveats. Not logging into some account connected with your person, or using a credit card connected with you via Tor etc.<br /><br />I think the biggest caveat is not from a technical point of view so much as a psychological one. If you&#039;re used to logging into your yahoo mail etc, then out of sheer habit you might accidentally login via the Tor network. Many officer workers login to their email dozens of times a day, so it&#039;s practically become a reflex like touch typing. Many people are using the Tor Browser Bundle, in which case they are using a torified mozilla firefox. If you&#039;re used to using mozilla firefox for regular web surfing, you could get caught out.
