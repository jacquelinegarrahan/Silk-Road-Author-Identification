				AirVPN offers #1, #2 and #3. They also offer OpenVPN over either SSH or SSL, which makes your VPN connection undetectable and unblockable by government or private authority. You can go with a privacy.li or whoever else offers SSH, but there&#039;s not much you can do if the destination node doesn&#039;t support it in kind for end-to-end encryption.<br /><br />There&#039;s a whole list of VPN providers which respect privacy and anonymity on TorrentFreak. A couple of posts actually. Check them out. Plenty of reviews there.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154287.msg1075220#msg1075220">Quote from: OuterLimits on May 01, 2013, 03:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can anyone recommend any SSH tunneling or VPN service providers that offer:<br /><br />1.

				Does paying a VPN compromise your anonymity? It&#039;s a legal service, and the fact that your credit card information is used for purchase doesn&#039;t compromise the anonymity of your browsing, right? Am I missing something?

				I&#039;d rather go with an SSH tunel, get a cheap vps (check lowendbox.com for example) in the location you want with either a VCC or with a provider that accepts bitcoin, and then torify your connection to that box (torify ssh -ND port user@host) and use that as a socks proxy in your browser.<br /><br />That way you&#039;ll have a clean, dedicated IP, and could stay totally anonymous, as you&#039;d be connecting to the VPS through TOR...<br /><br />It depends what you want to achieve though.. VPN -&gt; TOR -&gt; INTERNETS would make it so that your ISP can&#039;t know that you are using tor. TOR -&gt; SSH SOCKS PROXY -&gt; INTERNETS would make it so that the clearnet website you visit can&#039;t know that you are using tor...<br /><br />Good luck :)

				Has anyone used the amazon cloud. I know the official Tor website promotes it to set up a bridge. No one would know you were using a bridge as long as you don&#039;t give other people the IP, unless your ISP was using deep packet inspection. The cloud is also free up to 15 gb a year.

If you pay someone using a traditional form of payment, then you&#039;re right: it&#039;ll be known that you&#039;re using a VPN, when you signed up for it, how long your term is, and the exact type of service you signed up for. The solution? Pay with Bitcoin ONLY. Then there&#039;s no way anyone can ever find out who you are. Just make sure you use a Tormail address or something similar if you choose to leave any address at all.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To be critical though, we all know how reliable a companies statement are right...

Have they ever cooperated with LE in any part of the world? Have they ever handed over information to anyone at all? Do they respect whistleblowers and tailor their service for them?<br /><br />Trust is something that&#039;s earned, as anyone doing business on SR knows very well. There are a few VPN providers which have really earned the trust of their customers around the world. Search for them and you&#039;ll see. Either way, use Tor over OpenVPN and you&#039;ll achieve the highest level of anonymity that&#039;s currently known on the internet.
