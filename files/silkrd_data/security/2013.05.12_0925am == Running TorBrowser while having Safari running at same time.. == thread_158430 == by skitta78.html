				Is it safe to have a youtube video playing in Safari or Firefox while you have TorBrowser running through Tor at the same time?<br />Just curious if having two web browers open at once might compromise the safety of using TorBrowser and staying anonymous? <br />Anyone know for certain if this is safe or not?

				I am by no means an expert, but I have seen threads on here before that advise against using another browser at the same time as using TOR. Use the search function and I am sure you will find a better answer to your question than I can give you ;)

				I just found a similar post asking the same question and it had a mix of answers. Its better to be safe than hope but I like to have a music track playing on Youtube in Safari running then open TorBrowser to do the usual business. I dont want to take an unnecessary risk just to listen to some music but if I knew it was safe it would just be a good feature to have. You can find a 1hr+ mix from an artist playing in Youtube meanwhile do what you need to do in Tor.

				Its safe to run Tor Browser and Safari/Firefox at the same time, as long as you are not visiting the same website on both browsers at the same time on the same computer. <br /><br />The biggest risk is forgetting which is which and doing something stupid, like accessing your bank account through Tor.

				No I only use TorBrower for SR and this forum. Ive registered with Atlantis too but Ive put into vacation mode and dont bother checking it anymore due to lack of customers. Im quite paranoid by personality/nature so I dont want to take unnecessary risks. Its only because my computer is really my only source of music and Youtube is such a good free service. I really dont want to be traced using Tor by using another web browser at the same time. Im not a computer expert so I dont really know how to figure it out on my own. Im reading through the tor home page and trying to find out. Its alot of technical stuff I got to learn before I understand it all. Im fine using a computer but the hidden stuff going on behind the screen all seems quite confusing.&nbsp; &nbsp;
