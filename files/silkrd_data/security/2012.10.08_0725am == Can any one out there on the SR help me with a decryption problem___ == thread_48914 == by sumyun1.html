				I am trying to learn PGP and have been following the instructions suggested to me and I seem to be doing everything right. <br />I can generate my own public key in text edit, I can type a message in text edit and encrypt it. <br />My PROBLEM is that when I receive a encrypted message I cannot decrypt it in text edit. When I hit the command to decrypt the message I get a error message that says &quot;The &quot;OpenPGP: Decrypt&quot; service could not be used because the &quot;GPGservices&quot; appliceation did not respond to a request for services&quot; and then right below it on the same error message it reads: &quot;Try reopening &quot;GPGServices,&quot; or contact the vendor for an updated version&quot;<br />I have updated everything and can&#039;t seem to figure it out for the life of me.<br /><br />Can anybody help me out???

				You sure they sent you their public key? If they didn&#039;t the program will attempt to find it at the key servers but most of the time this does not work.<br /><br />It has something to do with the kind of public key they have, I believe that this can have some kind of corruption (guess i&#039;m no expert, huh?), because sometimes people will write me without sending me their key and I can decrypt with no problems.

				Sounds like you need to restart your machine or restart the GPG application you installed on your machine......<br /><br />You can look at some guides for installation/encryption/decryption here: http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/<br /><br />and then test your configuration here: http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/test.php<br /><br /><br />On the test page:&nbsp; <br />If you enter in your public key on the left hand page, then TorID will encrypt a message to your key for you to decrypt.&nbsp; <br />If you add the key listed on the right hand side, and then encrypt a message to TorID and paste it in the box on the left, TorID will decrypt that message and show you the contents.<br /><br />If both of these works out for you okay, then you&#039;re all set!

I am a vendor and I always use PGP for my customer&#039;s personal information; in fact, if they don&#039;t use PGP I cancel the order. But I have to confess I don&#039;t delve into the ins and outs of encription to the same level that you do. I don&#039;t understand more than a few words that you wrote about it (of course I don&#039;t use mac so maybe that&#039;s why).<br /><br />But do I understand that you have to download a &quot;build&quot; every day in order for this to work well?<br /><br />Also, how is it that a person can send me a message without sending me his public key, and most of the time I can decrypt, but a few times I cannot? Hope this isn&#039;t too much to ask of you, I know you&#039;re busy but I also know you&#039;re a standup guy willing always to help others.<br /><br />Thanks a lot.<br /><br />goblin
