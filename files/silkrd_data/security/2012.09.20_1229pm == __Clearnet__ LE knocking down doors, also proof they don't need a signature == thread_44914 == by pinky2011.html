				Whats the moral of the story guys??<br /><br />Its NEVER have packages sent to your house... always use a clean house with occupants who are drug free and and not in any legal troubles..<br /><br />By doing this It may take a few more days to get your package but its worth it.. I did not read about anyone being charged with anything yet and I bet a shit lawyer could beat a case like this a day after having his tonsils taken out...<br /><br />Pure crap these cops... kicking in doors for some weed....not charging anyone and really just looking real stupid once again..<br /><br />SO to recap..<br /><br />send to a clean house.. once arrived have someone mark it return to sender and let it sit for a few days... <br /><br />if you stick to this you shouldn&#039;t&nbsp; have any issues with juice monkey cops kicking in your door!<br /><br />

				^ Same thing happening here in Australia. In one of our states even our &#039;right to remain silent&#039; has been proposed to be changed, the problem is most of the Australian community is so apathetic that it will go through with minor backlash from the community.

Little by little, we&#039;re getting there. The most disturbing thing is how the law tends to side with the cops, almost without exception. You can find (very disturbing) YouTube videos of home raids -- people, children, pets getting shot -- the cops finding nothing, and nobody gets punished. I say &quot;almost&quot; because the Maryland mayor story is a rare exception. He sued and got restitution, but only because he was a well-known, well-respected member of the community. If you&#039;re an average citizen, you have no recourse. There is no presumption of innocense. The presumption is that LE did the right thing, even though we have innumerable examples where they didn&#039;t. Fuck LE.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What is a police state? Intelligence agencies monitor all of our electronic communications. Paramilitary troops storm our homes searching for substances that are banned solely for the profit of the prison industrial complex. We can&#039;t walk down the street without being stopped by police and harassed. Huge amounts of the fruits of your own labors are forcefully taken from you and handed to the state. Everything is regulated. The laws are such that your sentence is entirely at the mercy of the system, simply getting an order of marijuana can be charged anywhere from a low level crime to participation in a conspiracy with a thousand additional charges. Huge amounts of people are paid or coerced into becoming secret government informants. The mainstream media is owned by the political establishment, simply look at what Wikileaks has done versus what Fox or CNN have done. Propaganda surrounds us from the media, the schools, everywhere government sponsored propaganda is blasted at us. They track us by our cell phones, by our license plates, by huge networks of secret CCTV cameras and facial/gait/eye/remote fingerprint recognition technologies. People are arrested for simple things like possession of marijuana and sent off to indoctrination camps or locked in cells for years. Then they are released and monitored closely by parole officers. Our religious rights are trampled, the constitution says that the state shall not respect one religion over another, so why can some religious faiths use Peyote, some DMT? Why can Christians go worship God at church but we can not experience God through LSD or other psychedelics? U.S.A is a police state and honestly the people responsible must die. There is no victory for us until the people who have created this mess have severe damage done against them. A lot of people need to die, and I hope that I get to live to see the day. I hope I live to see the day that these scumbag federal agent slave traffickers are fucking gassed.&nbsp; I hope I get to see the day that all of the politicians selling us into slavery for the profit of the prison industrial complex get executed by firing squads.

Where the fuck are u gonna find someone that is not at all involved in the drug scene to let u import drugs to their house? Cops aren&#039;t stupid. they know the &quot;return to sender&quot; tricck. Once you take possesion of the package they can bust u. end of story. Please stop acting like your some fucking gangster that knows everything about this game because I personally know for a fact u dont have a clue. Your probably fucking 16 man....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />PLEASE DONT TAKE ANY ADVISE FROM JOHNMTL??????<br /><br />Who the fuck are you to tell people who to take advise from?!?!?!?!?!?!? <br /><br />Let me set a few things straight Mr. Bennet.<br /><br />First I am not a Gangster, nor do I ever claim to be, Second, who the fuck cares if I have MTL in my name,.. wtf.. I&#039;,m from montreal and and not trying to hide that and that is my prerogative.... You think you are so high and mighty because i asked you about prepaid tracked envelopes and excuse me if I did not know they existed and that I could drop them in a mailbox....I was not asking you about regular mail as I am not an idiot and know how regular mail works... The reason I never knew about these prepaid envelopes&nbsp; isunlike you and your small packages that you send.. I for many years have been sending over 5-10 pounds of weed around Canada and as such I cant just drop that shit in a fucking mailbox, I&#039;m not no petty little thug and I&#039;m sure i have made it farther in my life by the time I was 28 then you will ever reach my friend.. As for using a courier to ship large amounts... I&#039;d still chose them over CP or USPS any day... I&#039;ll have you know fedex and ups are the two largest movers of drugs in canada and the states by far!!!!<br /><br />Oh yeah, I almost forgot.. Where am i gonna find a clean person who would do such a favor for little gangster johnMTL????<br /><br />My friend I am not new to life, I have made many contacts over the years I have a big family and lots of friends, the majority of them are not criminal nor do any drugs and would never have a problem with me sending something to there address.<br /><br />Maybe this is because I am a straight forward person, I don&#039;t lie, and I try to come off as transparent as I can in all aspects of my life.<br /><br />You dont know me, you wont ever know me, you will always be striving to attain the things in life that I have already attained. you are a little fish in a big sea, I&#039;m not the biggest fish, But I sure as hell are a bigger one then you my friend, I am not a fool, I have lived a life most people can only imagine about.<br /><br />So do me a favor, you want to disagree that is awesome and I welcome further discussions between you and I in the future but by no means EVER tell anyone here who to listen to, You are not the &quot;all knowing Cicero&quot;, God, Or anyone important really so to recap..<br /><br />DONT DRAG MY NAME IN THE MUD BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH ME, YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHO I AM!!<br /><br />until next time my friend...<br /><br />Yours truly <br /><br />Montreal John<br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br /><br />I
