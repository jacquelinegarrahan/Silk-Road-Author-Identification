				I recently purchased some Bitcoins thru this exchange (www.get-bitcoin.com) the other day and thought a review may be helpful to bring them some attention and for newcomers looking for an exchange providing fast turnaround.<br /><br />This exchange guarantees 24 hour fulfillment or their services are free. My order was fulfilled in less than 3 hours - can&#039;t beat that! <br /><br />I was looking to make my first Bitcoin purchase the other day, and I wanted to use a Green Dot MoneyPak as I found it to be the best balance of speed, affordability, and anonymity compared to other methods. Reading many forums, it seemed that the best exchange to use was bitcoinexchange.cc, but after I noticed they no longer had MoneyPak listed as a payment option I decided to contact them for clarification. They told me that they were backed up with MoneyPak orders and that it would probably be a week before they could process it. I couldn&#039;t wait.<br /><br />Upon further digging, I came across Get-Bitcoin.com and saw a few (and by few I mean like 3 or 4) reviews where people were pleased with the service, but with so few reviews and this being my first purchased I must say I was a little hesitant. I&#039;m glad I took the risk!!<br /><br />Get-Bitcoin.com will definitely be my go to exchange for future orders. They charge a small fee of 5% for buying and 3% for selling - and for the most part that&#039;s it. There is a 3% surcharge for payments via Cashier&#039;s Check, Traveler&#039;s Check, Money Order, and Prepaid Debit Card. However, they also accept Cash, BankWire, Dwolla, Western Union, and MoneyPak. Cash, Western Union, and MoneyPak are your best options! Mailing address is in California, USA.<br /><br />They have a review thread at bitcointalk.org which I will be sharing this review with. This was a great fast experience and I highly recommend to other SR users.

				UPDATE:&nbsp; Already received confirmation of order being placed... I posted that I&#039;d pay a max of 2.39 USD/BTC and I got them for 2.2 USD/BTC... have not seen them in the wallet yet, but that should come in a few hours they said.<br /><br />So far so good...

				I&#039;ve actually had more problems with personal wallets--mostly my own stupidity, reformatting and shit, but still--now I pretty much keep it in the cloud, for different reasons...I&#039;d get the btc, say, at exchB or tradehill, then bounce to one--sometimes two--intstawallet, then to SR.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t like having them here on pc, tho lately, the way the exchanges and btc bounce around, it&#039;s up for debate.&nbsp; Me, I prefer most stuff online...but I like what I read so far about get-bitcoin.com...any of them, of course, have a degree of risk lately...for sure...

				I actually used this site my first time buying btc and its actually really fast, i had my coins in an hour.<br /><br />Unfortunately they arent accepting moneypak now either lol<br /><br />Update 10/20/2011: We&#039;re working on adding instant payment via MoneyPak, so that customers can enter their MoneyPak number on get-bitcoin.com and have payment confirmed on the spot. While we&#039;re setting this up, we must unfortunately disable MoneyPak orders for the next week. We greatly apologize for the inconvenience. All orders up to #1,072 have been confirmed and processed as usual.

				anyone able to report success with wells fargo cash deposit?&nbsp; I made one this morning, so it&#039;s only been about 4 hours, but I&#039;m just a tad nervous due to the new service, and because its a bit different than exchangebitcoins -- they don&#039;t ask to send confirmation of deposit, and they buy the coins based on the buy price i wrote in last night to create the deposit reservation.&nbsp; I&#039;ve sent an e-mail with a few questions, but wanted to see if anyone else has had success with this...<br /><br />MP will be a nice feature though, so I hope they are legit and don&#039;t end up clsoing down...

				I can now confirm successful cash deposit w/ get-bitcoin.&nbsp; Took approx 15 hours to confirm sending of payment, slower than exchb, but they are legit, so it looks like this is my go to site for now... especially once moneypak is offered...

				I emailed, and they answered--on weekend!...my question was basically if we could do it same way as was done on exhangebtc, u know, just deposit in WF branch, then take iphone and make copy, and send w/email to them, and I think the answer was &#039;yes&#039; but it was a bit vague....tomorrow, I&quot;ll give it a shot.&nbsp; exchanging bitcoins is totally legal, and, u know, it&#039;s nice to speculate a bit, make some bucks, as btc are going up again...<br /><br />But anyway, anything done that heads this way, goes thru instawallet.&nbsp; Worked good for me...seems, actually, works better keep it all in cloud, bounce around a few times, then send where you will...glad to see btc quit tanking finally, and now creeping upward...perfect.<br /><br />EDIT: Worked like a charm.&nbsp; I did it exactly like bitcoinExchange, with few minor differences:<br /><br />1) Send get-bitcoin a &#039;buy&#039; msg, telling how much, email addy, and btc addy (where u want them sent)...they will respond with account info.&nbsp; Good for 24hrs...<br /><br />2) Deposit cash at WellsFargo, using account info they send.<br /><br />3) Send email to get-bitcoin with picture of receipt.<br /><br />4) 1/2 hr later, receipt acknowledged, btc being sent.<br /><br />Note: using &#039;real&#039; name optional...u don&#039;t need it...
