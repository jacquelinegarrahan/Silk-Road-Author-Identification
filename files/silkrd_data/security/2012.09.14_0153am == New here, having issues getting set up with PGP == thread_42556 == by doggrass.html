				Hello everyone, i recently heard about the Silk Road community and thought it was a brilliant idea. I decided to give it a try as it is hard to come by many of these products in my area. I am having a few issues getting set up and some help would be very much appreciated. When i first started trying to import a public key, Kleopatra wouldn&#039;t open the file because it said it was the wrong type of file (saved public key in Notepad). Next i tried changing the file name to &quot;example.asc&quot;, when i tried importing the file it did not bring up an error but it did not process anything either. My computer knowledge is limited but decent, i am always willing to learn. Thanks for the help and im glad to be part of the community. <br />DogGrass

				I was having a lot of problems with Kleopatra too, mostly because it doesn&#039;t work with Windows 7 64 bit..<br /><br />You could always try GPG4USB I find it A LOT EASIER! on top of that the offline documentation is easier to understand I guarantee you won&#039;t have any more problems.<br />Plus its portable so you don&#039;t have to install it and you can keep it safe on a USB.<br />Works with Windows and Linux.<br /><br />In my opinion GPG4WIN is a 4.0/10 and GPG4USB is a 10/10 for what the programs and packages are trying to accomplish..<br /><br />google for it or you can download it at gpg4usb.cpunk.de
