				Hello everyone,<br /><br />I have been around for a short time looking over.. Items. I didn&#039;t really think that buying BitCoins would be difficult. I ended up searching for some time yesterday realising that its only possible via bank deposit and cash deposit fee is 15eu minimum (big enough for the amount I want to deposit). In my case, I live in Europe. I read about SEPA (almost 0 cost woo hoo) So I was mainly checking the sites offering SEPA. ended up on bitstamp. Also another site I saw in here was bitcoin.de . But I have some issues/questions. bitstamp seems promising but I read about situations where people lost their money (if I just transfer the funds from hand to bitstamp and the message is wrong or anything Im screwed I lost all my money) so I feel kind of weird over that.. As about bitcoin.de It requires you to verify your credit card. Well that way Its most probably an &quot;only legit people&quot; site which is the reason I am thinking of trying it. Forgot to mention about btc-e.com which is one of the most known sites I suppose (as long as its included on bitinstant.com ?) which buying with credit card is possible via liqpay (rarely heard of it in the past)<br /><br />So I am pretty much based on your opinions and experiences of where to get the bitcoins from.. <br /><br /><br />P..S.I know that there are many other posts over similar issues but I mentioned that sites change over time!<br /><br />EDIT: for $50+ on btc-e you have to contact support which asks you to send them to a specific number.. That doesn&#039;t seem so cool to me.. Is it working that way indeed?

				Bitstamp is good and keeps getting better (or I am getting luckier) last time I used it I sent SEPA on afternoon and the money was in my account next morning. I don&#039;t think you will lose your money if you mistype the confirmation code they give you, because they ask you how much money you are sending and your name, and they could match it from the bank transfer they ll receive, in case your code doesn&#039;t match.<br />Have you checked localbitcoins.com? It&#039;s anonymous and you can probably get some good deals if you live in a big city.

But will the bank where people do the cash deposit know that we&#039;re buying bitcoins from bluesky?
