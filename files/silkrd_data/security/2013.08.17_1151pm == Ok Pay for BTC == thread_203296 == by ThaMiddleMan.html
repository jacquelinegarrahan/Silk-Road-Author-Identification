				With mounting pressure on online money exchanges from US regulators, payments processor OKPay has announced that it is suspending processing for all Bitcoin exchanges, including industry leader Mt. Gox.<br />OKPay itself has had precious little to say publicly about the decision, other than issuing a one-line statement on its website to the effect that it is in the process of suspending its Bitcoin activities.<br />The headline on the notice says the suspension is temporary, but to hear Mt. Gox tell it, it may be some time before OKPay resumes business with the Bitcoin community.<br />

Gox has recently been informed by OKPay, one of <br />our longtime partners, that they are planning to stop performing wire transfers to and from <br />all Bitcoin exchanges, including Mt. Gox. <br />OKPay is offering a solution, but in the meantime we want to make sure that Mt. Gox <br />customers and the Bitcoin community are well-informed about this development. While <br />we are not completely clear about the dates of the transition, we would like to make a <br />couple of points clear:<br />•We will soon stop accepting deposits via OKPay. This may take up to a couple of <br />weeks, but it will happen eventually. <br />•Withdrawals to OKPay accounts will not be cut immediately, but will only be <br />allowed up to the amount that OKPay users have deposited into Mt. Gox via <br />OKPay. Beyond that amount there are other methods of withdrawal available. <br />Mt. Gox wishes the best to OKPay, and we look forward to working together more closely <br />in the future. The Bitcoin economy is going through many changes recently, and we are <br />positive that they will ultimately work themselves out in the best interests of the <br />community and the World. <br />Media Contact<br />press@mtgox.com<br />About Mt. Gox<br />Mt. Gox Co. Ltd. is a privately-owned Japanese corporation based in Tokyo, Japan. <br />Recognized as the leading exchange for Bitcoin, a digital currency, Mt. Gox has seen <br />unprecedented global growth in 2013 and is currently focusing on building stronger <br />infrastructure to promote the spread of Bitcoin throughout the world. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
