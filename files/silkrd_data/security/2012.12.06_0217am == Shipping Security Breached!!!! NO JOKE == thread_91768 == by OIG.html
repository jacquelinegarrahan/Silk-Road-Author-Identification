				A smart vendor will use printed mailing labels. These mailing labels will have a real address that is in realistic proximity to the blue box the package is dropped in. The vendor should have at least 5 different blue boxes he utilizes and at least 2 different addresses for each mail box.<br /><br />What you are claiming sounds a little too far fetched to cause any concern whatsoever for a responsible vendor.<br /><br />If you are buying massive quantities of drugs to your doorstep then you just aren&#039;t making good decisions in the first place.

The duties of investigators, and of the USPS OIG itself are laid out as follows: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Office of Investigations<br /><br />What do OIG Special Agents investigate?<br /><br />The Special Agent is responsible for conducting investigations regarding mail theft by employees, injury compensation and contract frauds, embezzlements and financial crimes, bribery and kickbacks, computer crimes, internal affairs, narcotics, and whistleblower reprisal. The Special Agent is also responsible for investigating conflicts of interest and allegations against postal executives.<br />&nbsp;<br />What happens during an investigation?<br /><br />USPS OIG investigators review relevant documents and interview complainants, witnesses, experts, and subjects. They may take sworn statements and use administrative subpoenas to obtain documentary evidence. The USPS OIG, in cooperation with the United States Attorney, may also use federal grand jury subpoenas to obtain information, reports, answers, accounts, papers, and other data and documentary evidence. During the course of an investigation, the USPS OIG may request assistance from other state, federal, and local government agencies, including law enforcement agencies such as the FBI. At the end of an investigation, the USPS OIG reports its findings to USPS management and, as appropriate, to prosecuting officials. The decision of what action to take rests with management and the prosecutor.<br />&nbsp;<br />What authority do Special Agents have under the law?<br /><br />As sworn federal law enforcement agents, Special Agents have the power to serve warrants and subpoenas issued under the authority of the United States; make arrests without warrant for postal-related offences committed in their presence; make arrests without warrants for postal-related felonies cognizable under the laws of the United States, if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested has committed or is committing such a felony; carry firearms, and make seizures of property as provided by law.<br />&nbsp;<br />What are the requirements to be a Special Agent?<br /><br />Applicants must maintain eligibility to operate motor vehicles.<br /><br />Applicants must have successfully completed the Basic Criminal Investigator Training Course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center or equivalent Federal/Postal Service law enforcement academy.<br /><br />Applicants must qualify and maintain authorization to carry firearms including no current or previous domestic violence convictions.<br /><br />Applicants must maintain physical, mental, and emotional standards, and requirements necessary to perform law enforcement assignments.<br /><br />Applicants must be able to work unscheduled, irregular hours with the possibility of personal risk.<br /><br />Applicants must be willing to relocate at the direction of management.<br /><br />What is an OIG investigation?<br /><br />Congress established the USPS OIG as an independent and objective unit within the Postal Service to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and misconduct. The role of investigations is to receive and investigate complaints or information concerning the possible existence of any activity constituting a violation of law, rules, or regulations. Under the Inspector General Act, the USPS OIG can assess all USPS records and conduct any investigation which in the Inspector General&#039;s judgment is necessary or desirable. Our investigations include alleged contract fraud, financial fraud, healthcare fraud, workers&#039; compensation fraud, and any other matter which could potentially affect the Postal Service. USPS OIG investigators - Special Agents - generally have law enforcement backgrounds and have worked in federal and state investigative units.<br />&nbsp;<br />Is there an age requirement for Special Agent positions in the OIG?<br /><br />Yes. The minimum age of entry is 21 years old and the maximum age is 37 years old.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here is general information on the USPS Office of the Inspector General: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The Office of Inspector General<br /><br />The Office of Inspector General (USPS OIG) was established in the Postal Service by 1988 amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978. The act had created OIGs in 12 federal agencies following a series of public spending scandals to investigate and audit the programs and operations of agencies that, in many cases, had failed to supervise their own spending, to ferret out fraud and misconduct, and to help prevent and end the misuse of funds. The act granted the Inspectors General broad authority to:<br /><br />- conduct audits and investigations;<br /><br />- access all agency records directly, using subpoenas if necessary;<br /><br />- request assistance from other government agencies;<br /><br />- administer oaths when taking testimony;<br /><br />- hire staff and manage their own resources; and<br /><br />- receive and respond to complaints from agency employees, whose confidentiality was to be protected.<br /><br />Inspectors General were not authorized to take corrective action themselves under the rationale that it would be difficult — if not impossible — for Inspectors General to review programs and operations objectively if they were directly involved in carrying them out.<br /><br />The Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 created OIGs in 39 additional government agencies and entities, including the Postal Service, but until 1997 the Chief Postal Inspector served as the Postal Service’s Inspector General, reporting to postal management.<br /><br />Recognizing the importance of a USPS OIG independent from management, in 1996 Congress created the Postal Service’s independent Office of Inspector General to be its eyes and ears to detect and prevent waste, fraud, theft, and misconduct. Although funded by the Postal Service, the Inspector General is appointed by the nine presidentially appointed Governors of the Postal Service and reports twice a year to the Governors and to Congress. The USPS OIG’s independence allows it to more effectively perform its mission, “to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of USPS programs and operations, while eliminating and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.”<br /><br />The Postal Service’s independent Office of Inspector General began with a single employee, Inspector General Karla W. Corcoran, who was sworn in on January 6, 1997. In one year’s time, the office hired 109 employees and set up field offices across the country to audit and investigate Postal Service programs and operations. It also established a hotline number to receive allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse, which received more than 14,000 calls in its second year.<br /><br />On August 20, 2003, the current Inspector General, David C. Williams, was sworn into office. In 2004, the scope of his office increased when Postmaster General Potter announced the transfer of additional investigative responsibilities from the Postal Inspection Service to the USPS OIG. Beginning February 7, 2005, allegations of postal employee misconduct including embezzlement, record falsification, workers’ compensation fraud, contract fraud, and on-duty narcotics violations, were referred to the USPS OIG. On May 1, 2006, the USPS OIG took over the responsibility for investigating all new allegations of these types. On September 1, 2006, the USPS OIG also began investigating all new allegations of mail theft by postal employees. To handle its increased responsibilities, the USPS OIG hired more than 260 new investigators in 2006.<br /><br />By the end of 2006, its staff numbered 1,071 and included special agents (federal law enforcement officers authorized to carry firearms, make arrests, and investigate federal criminal violations), auditors (professionals trained in government audit and accounting standards), and others crucial to its mission.<br /><br />Since it was established, the Office of Inspector General has issued 3,077 audit reports and management advisories accounting for more than $3.7 billion in questioned costs, unrecoverable costs, funds put to better use, and revenue impact. Examples of fraud uncovered by USPS OIG investigations include a trucking contractor defrauding the Postal Service of $1.5 million in fuel rebates; a highway route contractor defrauding the Postal Service of $120,468 for services not rendered; and a construction contractor charging the Postal Service $175,630 for work never done.<br /><br />During fiscal year 2006 alone, the Office of Inspector General completed 6,357 investigations resulting in 293 arrests, 237 indictments, 209 convictions, and 2,977 administrative actions. Injury compensation fraud investigations saved the Postal Service $105 million in long-term costs, and $20.9 million in fines and restitution went to the Postal Service as a result of investigative work.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />haha i love hero members!

				I can believe this.<br />And it&#039;s the only reason I can think of, besides many of the top vendors selectively scamming, for several mysteriously missing letters from these top popular vendors, when I normally would expect to hear from customs/cops if it was stopped.<br />Either alot, maybe most, of top vendors are scamming, or something weird is going on...&nbsp; in the past (also before SR) even tiny amounts would always result in customs notice &amp; cop interrogations. Numerous missing letters to one of my addressees now and havent heard from either, top sellers claiming their innocence and insists it was sent.. <br />A local newsreport on SR it was stated by customs that they &quot;know&quot; some seized packages originated from SR.. maybe Im not hearing from authorities now cos they know they need better evidence first and are gathering intel for a big international crackdown or something.<br />who knows..Ill keep ordering for now as Im still receiving some to this same address^_^
