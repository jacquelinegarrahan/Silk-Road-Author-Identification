				http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/19/online-drugs-trade<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The internet is playing an increasing and &quot;alarming&quot; role in the trafficking of both illegal and unauthorised prescription drugs, according to the body that monitors the trafficking and use of narcotics.<br /><br />Chemicals used for making heroin and cocaine and a range of drugs from methadone to amphetamines are being sold online by organisations that hide their identities from the authorities.<br /><br />The report, compiled by the International Narcotics Control Board, paints a picture of an ever-expanding and increasingly violent drugs market, with new trafficking routes being opened regularly. It calls for governments to take stronger measures against drugs, in particular cannabis. The board was criticised by drugs reform groups last night for taking an &quot;irrational&quot; approach.<br /><br />&quot;Drug traffickers are among the main users of encryption for internet messaging and by this means evade law enforcement, co-ordinate shipments of drugs and launder money,&quot; claims the board&#039;s annual report published today in Vienna. &quot;A co-ordinated, global response is needed to meet this challenge.&quot;<br /><br />Criminal organisations often pose as fictitious companies in order to acquire the chemicals they need to manufacture illicit drugs, says the report. The chemicals used to make amphetamines, methamphetamines and MDMA (ecstasy) are being obtained illicitly in large quantities. Traffickers are placing orders with legitimate trading companies and using falsified authorisations to import pharmaceuticals into countries where controls are lax. African countries are said to have become increasingly involved in the production and trade of such drugs.<br /><br />&quot;The internet is a major problem,&quot; said professor Hamid Ghodse, the board&#039;s president. &quot;That is why we started three years ago to have contact with Interpol (on the issue). There are illicit internet pharmacies and they do not have natural boundaries.&quot;<br /><br />He said that there was evidence of such activity in the United States, Thailand, Australia and the UK but that it was difficult for law enforcement agencies to track down the perpetrators.<br /><br />Cannabis continues to be the most widely used drug in Europe and Britons have the highest level of experience of it, with 37% having tried it at least once. Italy, France and Denmark have the next highest rates of use with Bulgaria, Malta and Romania the least. Schoolchildren aged 15-16 in the UK top the list for use of cannabis with 44% having tried it once. France, Spain, Ireland, the Czech Republic and Belgium are the other countries where schoolchildren have high rates of use. The countries where there is least use among schoolchildren are Greece, Cyprus and Romania. However, cannabis use among all schoolchildren in England dropped from 13% to 9% between 2001 and 2007.<br /><br />Ghodse said that many European countries were sending the wrong message on cannabis, by not treating it seriously. The report suggests that &quot;the international community may wish to review cannabis which, over the years, has become more potent and is associated with an increasing number of emergency room admissions&quot;.<br /><br />Afghanistan remains the world&#039;s major supplier of heroin with 92% emanating from there. One new development had been the re-emergence of Afghan cannabis, a major type used in the 1960s and 70s. The report suggests that &quot;cannabis cultivation has increased as this crop has become more lucrative&quot;. The board urges the Afghan government to &quot;give priority to stopping this alarming trend and to provide farmers with sustainable options of legitimate livelihood&quot;.<br /><br />Among other findings are that Canada has beome a major producer of ecstasy, using chemicals smuggled from China. Canadian versions of the drug have been found in Australia and Japan. Amphetamines have become popular in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. West Africa is seen as an important transit and stockpiling area for cocaine consignments from Latin America destined for Europe. Other conclusions are that Colombia remains the world&#039;s largest producer of coca leaf, despite extensive and US-funded eradication efforts, and illicit cultivation there has increased by 27%. Colombia accounts for 55% of the total area under illicit cultivation in South America, followed by Peru (29%) and Bolivia (16%). Latin America has seen an increase in &quot;date rape&quot; drugs, according to the report.<br /><br />The number of people in the US who abuse prescription drugs is now greater than the total taking cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy and inhalants, said the report.<br /><br />On the issue of access to controlled medicines, including morphine and codeine, considered by the World Health Organisation to be a human right, such drugs are virtually unavailable in more than 150 countries, according to the report.<br /><br />The board was criticised last night for its approach. &quot;The tragic irony is that it is the board&#039;s inhumane, unjust and irrational policing of the UN drug control system that has created or exacerbated most of the problems outlined in its report,&quot; said Danny Kushlick of the drug policy foundation, Transform.<br /><br />&quot;The board is complicit in gifting the illegal drug market to terror groups, paramilitaries and organised criminals, contributing to the political and economic destabilisation of producer and transit countries and putting millions at risk of contracting blood-borne viruses. The INCB and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime pose a greater threat to global well-being than drugs themselves.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
