				Been down the last few days, then this on their site today <br /><br />&quot;My Fellow Users,<br /><br />I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I feel you deserve to know what’s going on--the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.<br /><br />What’s going to happen now? We’ve already started preparing the paperwork needed to continue to fight for the Constitution in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. A favorable decision would allow me resurrect Lavabit as an American company.<br /><br />This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Ladar Levison<br />Owner and Operator, Lavabit LLC&quot;<br /><br />Scary times the last few days

				Sucks this guy had to shut down his biz due to the secret police after Snowden. I bet his subscribers went through the roof when the NSA email surveillance was leaked, at least he did the right thing and shut it down instead of letting the feds in and not saying anything to profit.

				I think we can say with certainty that if some privacy service like an Email or VPN provider is &quot;down for maintenance&quot; in the near future it is safe to say it is either already compromised or gone forever. Just like it happened with Liberty Reserve, FH / Tormail and now Lavabit.

				comsec<br />I woulnt bet this is anything much to do with snowden. He is simply the public event which they can now use to justify doing other stuff. Fascist minds all work one way and you can bet your life that shutting down any comms they cant read is right up there on their list. After all, if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear. might have been written by george orwell. This guy has done the right thing; theres obviously a court order on him to turn over the data but by closing down and appealing, he lets everyone know whats going on, and the appeal may delay said data being handed over, maybe buying time for anyone who feels compromised to take some damage limitation steps.

If he was &quot;working for the feds&quot; I don&#039;t think he would have exposed as much as he has. Maybe proof of NSA spying, just not the actual programs and procedures they used. Besides that I don&#039;t think they would send him to Russia as the FBI, NSA, CIA all can&#039;t get Putin to play nice, what would make you think they could get him to cooperate with something as big as this. Occam&#039;s Razor applies.

				It truly breaks my heart to see this is happening. The best solace is that more and more people are seeing it happen and although many are silent, I have to believe they have thoughts and feelings against this from happening and at some point a critical mass will occur where it will be &quot;washed away&quot;. What form &quot;washed away&quot; will look like, I do not know.
