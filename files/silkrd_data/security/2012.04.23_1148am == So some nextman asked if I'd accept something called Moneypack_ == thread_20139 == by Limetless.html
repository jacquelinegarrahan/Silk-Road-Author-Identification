				Yeah so this kid asked me if I&#039;d accept Moneypack (whatever the fuck that is?) or if I&#039;d accept Suboxone or something a bit like that as payment. <br /><br />Firstly, what the fuck is Moneypack? Never heard of that shit, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s less than safe though. <br /><br />Secondly, does anyone else think this tastes slightly Bacon flavored? I know I&#039;m feeling as though a Frankfurter has tried to test me. <br /><br />Thirdly, what the fuck is Suboxone? I&#039;ve never heard of that either, not to up on these addictive sounding meds. <br /><br />Anyone care to shed some light? By the way I did say no straight away, just a bit Curious George about the whole affair.

				1st. https://www.moneypak.com/ a product primarily intended for easy adding of funds to prepaid CCs<br /><br />2nd. I dont know the person who offered you...I dont know you either....but doesnt sound too &quot;bacon&quot;. Greendot is used by many to BUY Bitcoins. Check out the money section of SR youll see a bunch of &quot;your/my MP for BTC&quot; action. Given the surcharges associated with obtaining bitcoins, the time delay...trying to offer a vendor direct Moneypac isnt that odd really....though possibly a rule violation...not 100% sure.<br /><br />3. a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone....used as an alternative to methadone.

				ANY vendor should mozdev NOT except anything &quot;in trade&quot; or &quot;in the mail&quot;. DO NOT give up your address (as a vendor) except to your trusted suppliers.

				N2DEEP,<br /><br />1. Agreed, most likely not a bacon attack, but always best to err on the side of caution.<br /><br />2. Agreed, MP-&gt;BTC is acceptable. Just sometimes used to &#039;scam&#039; is all.<br /><br />3. Methadone (personally) gets me &quot;high&quot;...Subs...just DON&#039;T. Which is why you can get a script for Subs but not Methadone if you are an ex-addict, but not in &quot;chronic pain&quot;. Methadone users must go down to the clinic is all, compared to Subs, because Methadone actually gets the majority &quot;high&quot;. Subs just help stem withdraws, though I have gotten &quot;high&quot; from them in the past. Fucking &quot;partial&quot; opioid-antagonists. <br /><br />Works different for everyone I suppose. :)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew<br /><br /><br /><br />

The Naloxone is an antiagonist added to counter the effects of the buprenorphine. So obviously if your wanting to get high....methadone is a better choice than suboxone....just as heroin is a better choice than methadone. But for its intended purpose, mitigating opioid withdrawl syndrome.....suboxone is clearly superior.<br /><br />Subutex which is buprenorphine alone is mg to mg more powerful than methadone...but it has an efficacy ceiling where methadone doesnt....this form is generally considered a better alternative for long term maintenance than&nbsp; methadone.
