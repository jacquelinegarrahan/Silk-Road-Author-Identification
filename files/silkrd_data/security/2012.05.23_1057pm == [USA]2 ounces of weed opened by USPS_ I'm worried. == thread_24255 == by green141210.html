				So I ordered two ounces of some grade A tree and as it turns out, someone overwatching power decided to fuck me up the ass. My mailman decided he didn&#039;t believe I lived in my house anymore, so he marked the package as &quot;addressee unknown&quot;. From there, it went back to the return address which obviously is a dead end and fake. According to the DCN, it was then marked as &quot;undeliverable as addressed&quot;. I don&#039;t know how many of you are familiar with the next step in the process, but packages that cannot be delivered and cannot be returned to the sender are sent to the USPS Recovery Center. This is a giant evil place in Georgia where they open every package, letter, box, parcel, dildo case, and search for valuables. If the contents are worth more than 25 bucks they auction that shit off like greedy fucking pigs. (all of this taken from the USPS Recovery Center FAQ). Unfortunately, this is where they open my package and discover a felony with my name on it. I hate to come off as a total retard, but I actually called USPS (before I knew where the package was going) after it had been a week since it was shipped. The vendor gave me the tracking #, which I gave to them . Through my cell phone. MFW they told me the package was going to this dreaded recovery place... Not good. So what I&#039;m asking is how worried should I be? I&#039;ve cleaned my house, and I&#039;m gonna drop the DBAN bomb if worst comes to worst. My phone, unfortunately, I have no idea what to do about. If anyone has suggestions or consolations I will marry your virgin daughters into wealth. Thanks.

				A couple suggestions. <br /><br />A) Deny till you die<br /><br />B) Have a lawyer&#039;s number handy<br /><br />C) Deny till you die<br /><br />Addendum- Make up a story. For example, your childhood/teenage years friend was sending you a gift. You have no idea to what it is.

				There is nothing you can do about your phone, but just because you were sent a package, it doesnt mean you knew what was inside it. At worst, explain that to a lawyer, not the cops.

				You should have called from a cheap $10 prepaid phone. Anyway, depending on your phone carrier you could just get a temporary one and switch your number and service to the temp phone and transfer your contacts. Then just take the battery out of your main cell, and stash the whole thing at some place hidden well. You could just say your phone went missing at some public place recently, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll care about it that much since they got an address,&nbsp; but just deny deny deny. Got a package of shrooms lost in the mail a couple months ago and I&#039;m still fine.

I would say its unlikely. More likely then not, nothing will come of it. Just be calm and if they come, SAY NOTHING and lawyer the fuck up.

				Agreed with all said. Silence is your best friend in this case unless you are familiar and clever enough to answer questions they ask&nbsp; you answers that make them walk away believing you. Do you have a criminal past? Drug arrest? History of being around drug offenders? Have a good respectable job? Many things work in your favor aside from keeping silent. If you can talk to them and know what you are doing and know tell signs of physical gestures cause these people are trained to spot a lie&nbsp; just how your body moves. it is called profiling. Research all you can to turn the tables on these guys. Do not appear nervous and or scared but if you just can&#039;t help it and they ask why you are nervous&nbsp; just respond by saying &quot;come on buddy I got the police knocking at my door wanting to talk to me about illegal things I have no idea about wouldn&#039;t you be nervous and concerned too? If they respond with the well if your innocent you have nothing to worry about. respond saying &quot;Sir no offense but tell that to all the people who have been released from prison the last 10 yrs thanks to dna evidence that was wrongly convicted and say sorry I get nervous and my heart races if a cop car gets behind me driving&nbsp; that is just a natural reaction it has nothing to do with doing anything wrong&quot; and if you are 100% percent sure your place is clean yes it goes against what everyone says but id say your welcome to come in look around&nbsp; run my past history I have never been in trouble with the law I have a good job and come from a good family&nbsp; seriously I have no idea what all this is about&#039; All jokes aside&nbsp; how you respond and what you do with that first visit from them will mean the difference between them leaving&nbsp; walking to thir car or suv or whatever they are in at the time and saying to each other this guy aint no drug dealer waste of our time&nbsp; or them leaving and saying yeah he has guilt written all over his face and we probably just hit the tip of the ice burg depending on how large your shipment was that was seized. why in the world did you use your real name anyways? you want nothing traced to you buddy NOTHING. your address dont mean shit if presented in court cause many ppl have lived there and if you live in an apt it could be someone else in the building gave a wrong address by accident and IF there are no business around your apt building with cameras&nbsp; make a few calls to 911 over the next month or so and say these kids/teenagers keep coming in my apts hall way and i can smell they smoked weed one time and I am worried they will catch the building on fire. Can also say you heard them talking about buying and selling drugs.&nbsp; make it sound real don;t say all these black kids haha cause white people like my self tend to always want to say a crime was committed by some black ppl if they want the cops to believe them that&#039;s not true always. give little small details that makes it sound real and not made up&nbsp; say you opened the door and asked if they had family or friends that lived in the building and if not they need to leave and say one of the kids walked with a limp and smarted off to you on the way out and had a weird accent but not sure what it was.&nbsp; little shit like that makes many ppl say &quot;if he was making this up he wouldnt have said all that &quot; trust me. HITLER said it best. the bigger the lie the more ppl with believe it. Guess it comes down to how well you can LIE. Not a skill to be proud of or use often but at times comes in handy as honesty is NOT always the best policy. just make sure your place is super clean if you ask them in. Lay a bible out on the table&nbsp; some comic books&nbsp; &nbsp;buy yourself a star trek or star wars poster and just make yourself look like a harmless geek but at the same time a well educated harmless geek that is not going to be lied to and have his rights taken away from you. get a fraternal order of police sticker for your car and front door too haha. Join them even. you be surprised at what a good connection if you are well liked by a cop can do for you. Never have enemies my friend make as many friends as possible and be good to everyone cause the one you shit on today might be holding your jail ticket tomorrow. i am always nice to cops not cause I just want them to like me if I ever have a run in with them but cause I actually respect most cops for what they do. Just not the ones that look at us drug users as evil immoral ppl that should be behind bars just cause we enjoy a head change and relaxation while we are just relaxing&nbsp; at home watching tv. WE ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE oh and if it gets to the point you think they are not buying what you are saying and just fishing for&nbsp; answers to questions that do not even concern your package just say Sir Mam I already went against&nbsp; attorneys advice and invited you in just to be polite as I have nothing to hide and I have talked to you even though it is my right not to do so&nbsp; and you clearly&nbsp; seem to think I am not telling the truth so I am stopping this hear and letting my legal counsel take over. If he is a smart ass and ask well why do you need or have legal council&nbsp; just say for instances just like this when the police clearly are not ;listening to the truth and only want to hear what they want. My attorney will say the rest. then MUM is the word and politely ask them to leave. Also have a friend on call just in case they come knocking and if you have answering machine that ppl can hear when it picks up have your friend call and say some shit like hey buddy I was just seeing if we was going to the church singles group tonight haha. Like i said small details. no one said nuts and bolts were interesting but they hold everything together. ONE more thing&nbsp; if you are not capable of remembering everything you have told them word for word then dont&nbsp; say anything cause they will run across everything you say 100 times trying to get you to change a part of it cause once you get caught in a lie all creditability is lost. Oh and if you work in a trade such as IT or some other field you can donate time and work for. find a great criminal attorney ask if you can donate your services&nbsp; fixing his computers or whatever else free of charge and say you do it for humanitarian reasons. haha get in good with one. and the part about the friend calling the machine and asking about the church thing. make sure you&nbsp; already called around and found a real CHURCH&nbsp; with a real singles group cause they might try and ask you about that and then you got to go into a big spill on that lie. one lie leads to another so make sure you have every contigencey anticipated before hand,.

You should use Truecrypt (http://truecrypt.org) full disc encryption on your home computer, DBAN is going to take too long if you wait until they&#039;re knocking on your door. I strongly recommend encrypting your computer. Expect that the police will turn up, it&#039;s highly likely now, but as long as you say nothing and admit nothing they can&#039;t do shit.

				This is why I no longer use cell phones, this is the most revealing and insecure piece of data device you can own, might as well put a neon sign on ur head this is what i do. Reminds me of an incident buddy once had, the delivery man claimed he couldn&#039;t find the house which he comes to nearly daily, the package was claimed had to be delivered, the parcel man opened the package and stole 2 of the 3 sacks of weed and packaged it back up except the tape on the container inside the package he cut.<br /><br />Call an attorney now if your worried tell him the truth the whole truth say nothing to police but your attorneys phone number.<br /><br />Package intercepts is a big bizz of the feds it works like this. They have a fbi dressed up try and deliver you a package and say you have to sign. If you sign you admittedly state you were expecting this package. If you deny they get pushy about it &quot;good clue&quot; Tell them to fuck off. If you accept the package it uses a transmitter inside soon as the package is opened with illicit goods you are now the owner of them and the goon squad in the woods breaks in your door and arrests you. Yeah even for little tiny shit. It has even been stated of the postal officer opening the package after desperate attempts and saying oh this is only a few pills or grams that&#039;s legal for personal use.<br /><br />If your more worried then highly disk encrypted methods in serpent or two-fish then take your hdd out after formatting in in low level open it and smash the plates throw it away. That&#039;s even what my isp advised to do when was a lad and got in trouble being curious on the net.

				If a &#039;postman&#039; appears asking you to sign for the parcel then just refuse - take a look at it - then say &quot;I&#039;ve never ordered anything from that &#039;state/nation&#039;. Hand it back. <br /><br />I knew someone who got sent some cannabis oil made by an English guy over out of pretty low grade weed that was a wheelbarrow full for the cost of an oz of UK skunk. <br /><br />The oil deliveries went well until one day the parcel came. He signed for it. Then a lot of policemen appeared and forced their way into the home.<br /><br />But IF you order say a lot of stuff off Amazon or E bay or generally buy legal items online - maybe you could sign for it. Leave it unopened for 24 hr. If nothing happens its safe!<br /><br />The best method of delivery is for you to buy some legal item from the nation your package is being delivered from. No record is there to trace anon buying 2 oz of weed. But you got receipts and even proof that you were expecting a delivery.<br /><br />I know my postman by first name. Never had an envelope or parcel go missing ever and that is with hundreds of online transactions! Not all here of course. <br /><br />Moral of the tale - tip the postman at Christmas - give him/her a card. Introduce yourself. <br /><br />Make sure your letter box or mailing system is in plain sight!<br /><br />Always have a tidy garden - a lived in look. This is for the sake of appearances. Fly a flag. Mow the law. Draw the curtains at night and put musi con to drown out an tell tale sniff of the lines of coke!<br /><br />Actually in your case - given the parcel will be opened - you ought to refuse to take it. Clean up home asap. And your car! <br /><br />You should be fine really unless you fold under pressure and admit it thinking it will make things better. no it will not! Deny ever buying drugs by post ever. Feigh surprise that you have never heard of it - only the CNN reports on fake pharms sold online!<br /><br />All they got is a parcel with your name and address. This does not prove you own the parcel. I know someone who once got sent dozens of packets of VERY high value cannabis seeds. Wrong address!<br /><br />Deny it all. no proof is there. In fact 2 oz of weed with no real proof to tie you to it might well see the cops arrest you on suspicion but a good lawyer is going to get you out on bail before the adverts are over. <br /><br />Lets say you live in a No 34, its possible it was for 134 or 43 or 33 or 35 or 39. A 4 can look like a nine! <br /><br />Cops may search the computer for records if it was a kilo but two oz? <br /><br />Cops will try to make you think they will just hug you if you admit you did buy two oz by mail. <br /><br />Deny it all.<br /><br />Don&#039;t act dumb. Just act surprised over someone posting drugs to your address. Deny you ordered them and you will not be charged..<br /><br />People get all manner of stuff by post they never ordered! Each day in the UK thousands of items ate wrongly delivered. The USA is far worse - and its possible some postal worker will have that 2 oz in his or her stash by now anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to work in that place. A LOT of people use the post to send drugs. I knew many who done this in the 80s! Not vacuum sealed but it was less strict then. <br /><br />As long as something is clearly addressed and the proper amount of postage is on there - then the chance of it not being delivered really is thousands to one. <br /><br />In the UK tens of thousands of people send drugs via the post every day to buddies, relatives and so on. <br /><br />SR never invented it&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />They just updated it with digital technology to make the process available to anyone.<br /><br />&nbsp;
