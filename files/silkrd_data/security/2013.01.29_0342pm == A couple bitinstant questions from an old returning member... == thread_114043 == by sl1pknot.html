				Hey guys, I took a break from this wonderful site at about the beginning of November. At that time Bitinstant had temporarily removed the cash deposit option. I&#039;ve been doing a bunch of lurking the past few days and I&#039;d appreciate it if somebody could answer my questions.<br /><br />Is it still safe to use Bitinstant on Tor? Or is it more advisable to go use free wifi somewhere and use clearnet?<br /><br />And for the bank cash deposits I&#039;m under the impression that they ask lots of personal info and potentially ask for you ID, however I&#039;ve been told that if you use Moneygram at say, Walmart, they don&#039;t ask for ID and it&#039;s fine if you just write down all fake information. Is there truth to this?<br /><br />Thanks guys, have a nice day.

				My friend used bit instant recently, even using the moneygram kiosk where she can use a debit card.&nbsp; Since there is nothing illegal about &quot;paying a bill&quot; that funds her mtgox account, she hasn&#039;t worried about it the one time she did it this way.&nbsp; It is pretty cheap for her too, for example if she made a $1,000 deposit at the moneygram vcom kiosk then transfer through mtgox to btc to sr, she end up with approximately $960 worth of BTC in her SR account.&nbsp; Obviously she hasn&#039;t made anywhere near this large of a deposit since the max is lower than that, but that should give you an idea of the fees and everything.&nbsp; She used a clearnet browser also.

				Mt. Gox isn&#039;t even necessary I&#039;m pretty sure.. I was considering using it to purchase btc but a wire transfer was going to cost me $40 out of about $220 so I wanted to avoid it. <br /><br />edit:<br /><br />Fuck it, I&#039;m just gonna use bitinstant on tor and use a tormail email, put all fake info, remember it and put the same fake info at walmart, and make my deposit. Here goes.

				That should work just fine lol.&nbsp; I think she said the reason she went through bitinstant-&gt;mtgox-&gt;btc-&gt;sr is because it gave a bit more flexibility in the exact moment when the btc were bought and one can watch the price rise and fall... buy low sell high! but don&#039;t sell &quot;high&quot;... haha

				You can still use bitinstant through Tor provided your exit node resolves to a united states IP address when using geolocation and you deposit cash through moneygram at a walmart, see more at this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26058.390

				Sometimes they&#039;ll ask you for your ID when making the deposit, in which case I just tell them I had my wallet stolen, which is why I have to use Moneygram to pay my bills
