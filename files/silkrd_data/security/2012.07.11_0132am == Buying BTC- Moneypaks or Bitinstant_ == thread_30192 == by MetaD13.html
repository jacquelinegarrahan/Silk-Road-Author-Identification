				Should I buy my bitcoins through moneypaks or bitinstant.com? With moneypaks, I could simply trade with a trusted vendor on here, but there&#039;s a chance of getting scammed and the fees seem unusually high. With bitinstant, I could easily buy the bitcoins at a local store but it seems like this would leave an unwanted trail(in case I get caught).<br /><br />Can someone help me with this decision please? I&#039;d much appreciate the help. Thanks!

				I&#039;ve done moneypaks before, and their is just a good deal of scammers. I have never user bitinstant, I would like to hear what others say, is it a for sure thing? If so why doesn&#039;t everyone use it?

				I have used Bitinstant many times with no trouble.The fees are not that bad and the service is very fast. Once I pay at the store I normally have the money in my account before I get to my car.

				You&#039;re much better off using bitinstant because you will get your btc for sure no matter what. Its really easy to use the moneygram method through bitinstant. I would never go through anyone using moneypak just because that is the most common way that people scam nowadays.

				Moneypak is a terrible idea. High fees + High potential for being scammed. There is just no benefit to it. <br /><br />Buying bitcoin isn&#039;t illegal. The truly dangerous part of using this site is waiting on the actual delivery. And the danger surrounding that can be circumvented by only ordering from established vendors and not talking to the 5-0

				Bitinstant all the way. Aside from the scam potential, I have had annoying delays with BTC traders. With Bitinstant, less fees and your coins are waiting for you when you get back home.<br /><br />As far as the paranoia, remember there&#039;s nothing illegal about getting bitcoins. If youre smart, you&#039;ll launder them anyway, so no big deal. Besides, if you use Bitinstant with the Moneygram/Walmart method, you can just use bogus info on the form and I dont think it make any difference. No trail, unless youre going to get uber paranoid over security cameras seeing you. Unless youre dealing with huge transactions, I dont think anyone really gives a shit.
