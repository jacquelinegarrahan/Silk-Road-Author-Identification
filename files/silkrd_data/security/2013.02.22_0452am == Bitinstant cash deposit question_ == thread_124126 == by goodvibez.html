			<dd class="postbody">
				Just had a question about getting bitcoins through bitinstant/zizap cash deposit.... I&#039;ve tried to deposit more than 500 dollars before and it says the limit is 500 dollars, so I&#039;ve been restricted each time to only being able to get 500 dollars worth of bitcoin, well now I need to get enough coin for over a grand so I&#039;m curious if I&#039;m able to fill out 2 deposit slips at the same time or is there some sort of restrictions on that? Or is there an easier way to do all of that?..... Any input would be much appreciated&nbsp; :)

				you can do that, but you need to do it for two different amounts to be sent to two different btc addresses, and to be safe, use two different sets of info.<br /><br />otherwise, the 2nd one will get caught up in their fraud filter.

				umm you can&#039;t use the following with bitinstant at the moment<br />To BTC Address<br />To email<br />BTC-e<br />Bitstamp<br /><br />So they are pretty much worthless right now unless you want to deal with MtGox which I personally don&#039;t.<br /><br />Hope the fix it soon.<br /><br />I did a successful transaction at ziggap.com -&gt; cash deposit at Chase Bank -&gt; BTC address and had my coins in 4 hours.<br /><br />

				This Bitinstant outage is a pain in the ass.&nbsp; I just sold a computer, and I have cash I want to turn into BTCs.&nbsp; But, it looks like I&#039;ll have to wait until Monday to do a Bitfloor deposit.&nbsp; Is there so little money to be made in that business that only one company is doing cash to BTC transfers via moneygram?&nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t use bitinstant at all at this point. Still waiting for btc for a depost 5 days ago. There reply was that they don&#039;t have enough to cover it!!<br /><br />Some people are using ziggap.com and having good experiences there.<br /><br />-mm

				So Bitinstant will be back up and functional Monday? I like using them when they aren&#039;t fucked up, which is about every 2 weeks. I couldn&#039;t figure out ziggap.com, and I don&#039;t like Mt Gox for some of the reasons already mentioned above. <br /><br />Fuck

				Bitfloor was pretty cool.&nbsp; I deposited $78 and the total was $79.75.&nbsp; The money showed up in my bitfloor account immediately.&nbsp; There you can actually buy/sell bitcoin in any amount, as I only needed 2 BTC to complete a transaction - I made a &#039;buy&#039; order for 2 BTC and it made the transaction at the current price ($31.48 each?)&nbsp; I had like $16 left over in USD in the account and 2 BTC in the account.&nbsp; Then I withdrew to my SR account and it took about an hour to show up (as usual).<br /><br />The deposit itself was very simple.&nbsp; I just acknowledged 3 things by checking the boxes, entered the amount that I needed in my account ($78) and it pulled up a screen that had the deposit amount (which you have to make exactly for it to work) and the account number, business name, etc...&nbsp; So I drove up to BofA, went to the drive-thru teller, asked for an out-of-state deposit slip (I don&#039;t live in NY, where the business is based) and filled out as much as I could, put the slip and the money in the tube, sent it to the lady and she gave me a receipt.&nbsp; <br /><br />My bitfloor account was credited with $78 within a few minutes (5 maximum), that&#039;s when I had to &#039;buy&#039; the BTC I needed (you can either put how many BTC you want to buy or you can say you want to buy $XX worth of BTC) same thing with selling...<br /><br />I think its geared around people who may day-trade BTC??&nbsp; Either way, it was very simple for what I needed to do today due to BitInstant being down.<br /><br />Whole thing took maybe an hour and a half from entering deposit info, driving to bank, trading for BTC, driving home, and funding SR wallet.&nbsp; WAY CHEAPER than BI...
