				Today I tried to put some bitcoin into an instawallet, and I got this error like 1 min after I transferred it from my wallet to them:<br />&quot;we&#039;re sorry, something must have happened&quot; or something very similar in red, on a blank white page.<br /><br />So I reloaded the page for about a 1/2 hour and all this time the transaction was unconfirmed from my other wallet. So then my instawallet finally loaded and showed 0 bitcoin still. Then I looked at my wallet and the transaction has been confirmed about 12 times now and it is still not there. It has been about 4 hours since the initial transfer.<br /><br />Anyone else have this happen or perhaps have some advice? I am not really freaking out, just didn&#039;t see any other threads about this.

				Exact same thing happened to me today.&nbsp; The instawallet eventually showed my BTC, but now they&#039;ve been sitting there for two hours with: &quot;These funds are not confirmed yet, they will be spendable in approximately 10 minutes&quot;, I can&#039;t get the damn coins out...

				I&#039;ve been having problems with Instawallet all day.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done the process over a dozen times but this time somehow it has taken the whole day, and the funds still aren&#039;t in my wallet.&nbsp; After 31 confirmations, it looks like they were deposited, but now for some reason (and frankly this is freaking me out right now) the coins I put into the wallet look like they are being combined with the funds of another wallet and sent to two different wallet addresses- none of which I recognize.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is according to blockchain.info, and while this is the first time I&#039;ve used it and I don&#039;t know what this signifies, it has never taken this long for my funds to arrive.&nbsp; Does anyone have any knowledge of instawallet or blockchain.info to explain why my funds have still yet to arrive at the instawallet address, and now there seems to have been a 2nd transactions which sent the whole amount to another address?<br /><br />The instawallet doesn&#039;t even say 20 minutes to confirm...

				Exact same thing appears to have happened to my transaction as well. Perhaps they were hacked or something? Could someone who has a lot of experience with this possibly help at all?

				wow, this exact thing happened to me today too.&nbsp; They were instantly transferred out of my wallet and I never even saw them in.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used instawallet many times, but never been scammed before.&nbsp; According to the block chain it looks like somebody hacked the site or we were scammed.&nbsp; Any help appreciated.&nbsp; I would not use instawallet again.

				If you want to look at the logged in profiles you can see that we are probably on simultaneously.<br /><br />I am a frequent user of the site, but I didn&#039;t feel like exposing my name and connecting it to a specific transaction.&nbsp; I have 0 failed orders out of ~30 and about hundreds of bitcoin spent on the SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />Either help us, or don&#039;t post.&nbsp; If this hack is really happening then you will hear it in the news soon enough.&nbsp; I thought I was seeing things until getting on and seeing two others who say the same thing.&nbsp;

				3 others.&nbsp; I emailed instawallet and still waiting on reply.&nbsp; I can see the address where my coins along w several other addresses were sent at the same time.&nbsp; That looks like a hack or inside job etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why instawallet would want to scam its customers.

				I dont think this is limited to ust instawallet. i think all bitcoin transactions are being diverted. I just sent a very small test amount from SR to MTgox and it is now in this douchers wallet too!

				I don&#039;t expect to get my money back, about $250, but I would like to stop other people from losing theirs if possible.<br /><br />It&#039;s frustrating because I don&#039;t know what to do.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like there&#039;s a Bitcoin watchdog I can call to alert.

				Yea, I am basically looking at this as lost bitcoin at this point. Good thing I decided to test it out as this would be my first time trying so I didn&#039;t want to lose too much if I ended up getting screwed. I lost roughly $150, which really sucks but I am glad I didn&#039;t try to put it all in at once or I would have lost a heck of a lot more. Live and learn, I guess...

				do you think it would work to try bitinstant again to your actual btc wallet? and thru my bank account. has anyone done this? can it be done in the same day?&nbsp; Should you use your real info w your bank account?

				This sounds rediculous! Must be a brand new thing happening. Last week it was working perfect. Instawallet was the go to easy anonymous move to get things started. Wonder whats to come of this or what users of instawallet will do now

				This exact same thing happened to me yesterday (including blockchain showing it being combined with other amounts).&nbsp; I emailed the site owner about it after waiting 4+ hours and he sent me a reply within the hour saying he fixed it.<br /><br />Moral of the story: email instawallet support and he will fix it.

				This man above me knows what he is talking about.&nbsp; Simply email their technical support and they will help you if anyone else is having this problem. It was a glitch on their end because of how they wash your coins.<br /><br />Thank you instawallet! You guys are still awesome!

				i too have my coins!&nbsp; instawallet emailed me. that was really odd...not sure if they always do that and it was just slow, i&#039;ve never actually checked the blockchain on these transactions. either way, instawallet is still credible, wait till their management replies before you freak.&nbsp; &nbsp;They did say they had a small technical issue last night, so I assume this is not always the case.
