				I need a MP but the only ones I can find are the ones for refilling &quot;Rushcards&quot;. It says on the back that I can call if I need to use it for anything other than refilling whatever a rushcard is.<br /><br />Can I use these in place of a regular MP?<br /><br />I tried calling but my battery literally died while I was on hold. Their customer service is a disgrace. I bet I&#039;ll get an answer from here quicker than their joke of a support number.

				hmm... probably not going to be much help, but i didn&#039;t know there were cards specifically for refilling rushcards.&nbsp; Green Dot recommends that you use a regular MoneyPak to refill rushcards...<br /><br />So it sounds like what you&#039;re looking at ARE normal moneypaks, but i&#039;m not going to advise you to buy it just yet<br /><br />could you maybe give a bit more info about the rushcard refillers you&#039;re looking at?

				^^You were correct! On the back, it says &quot;To use this MoneyPak other than to reload a RushCard, call (800) 473-3636 or visit www.moneypak.com.&quot; According to their dismal customer service, these rushcard MPs work like any other MP. <br /><br />Chronic Crew agreed to process these rushcard ones, but I dunno if this is something he&#039;ll do regularly for those of you finding this thread via search.

				i do believe the RUSHCARD has a visa attached to it so its accepted everywhere visa is accepted. <br /><br />calling.....<br />might want to use a throwaway phone to call moneypack as i am sure the call number is recorded and all conversation. usually takes about an hour to get thru even know it keeps saying only 20 more minutes ;)<br /><br />oh yeah.... dont refill the cards.... use the number once and throw it away.. If a mp vendor was crafty they would hold onto your number and try it over and over for a while to see if u did refill it... also think about paying someone else to get the card those cameras at the registers are quite good and they time stamp the purchase and can cross reference the camera and get your id. Travel around far from your location when buying the card. dont want them all coming from one location.... there are just some holes in the MP game u should be aware of. <br /><br />OR i could just be parrrr-a-noid!!!! OR missing the point all together!<br /><br />good luck!
