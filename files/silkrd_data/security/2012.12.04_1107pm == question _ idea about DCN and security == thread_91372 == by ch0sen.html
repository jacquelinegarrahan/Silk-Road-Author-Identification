				I have been reading a lot and have read a lot of the DCN and FE issues.&nbsp; So I thought of this.<br />I could also be wayyyy off base and if so then oh well.&nbsp; Just trying to learn...<br /><br />When a buyer encrypts their address and sends to buyer, could it not also be sent to a &quot;holding&quot; area<br />where if there is a dispute about delivery, a third party (SR admins?) could decrypt the address<br />to compare against whatever tracking was used?&nbsp; I suppose this would only prevent a seller from sending to some other<br />address if they are trying to scam.&nbsp; I was driving earlier and the thought popped into my head as a way to protect<br />buyers and sellers.&nbsp; I guess the real problem would be that the buyer has to trust SR with their personal info.<br />

				I can&#039;t think of a way that could work if you don&#039;t trust the vendor. <br /><br />They could sign your address and tracking number then encrypt and send it back to you, then in the case of a dispute you could release your tracking number and address to SR to aid in investigation. You could prove that they confirmed the tracking number and address (it&#039;s signed by them) and wouldn&#039;t need to release details to SR unless there&#039;s a dispute (it&#039;s encrypted for you), but you&#039;d still need to trust the vendor not to send an empty parcel.
