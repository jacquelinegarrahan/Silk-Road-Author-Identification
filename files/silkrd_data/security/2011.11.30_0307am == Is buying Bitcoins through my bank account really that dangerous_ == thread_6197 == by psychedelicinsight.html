				Hi, I&#039;ve set up everything I need to make purchases on SR except for acquiring bitcoins. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been to get-bitcoin.com, and I have an insta-wallet, but I don&#039;t know which payment method too choose. I obviously want to go the safest route, but the bank transfer is definitely the easiest and quickest.<br /><br />Is it really that dangerous? I just don&#039;t see the DEA tracking my bank account purchases over a personal amount of drugs.

				If you&#039;re not dealing then they probably wont care but it is your safety so take whatever steps will make you feel comfortable. I personally go from bank account, to Dwolla, to Mt. Gox, to a coin tumbler, to my wallet, to my SR account, through SRs coin tumbler, and finally to vendor. I feel there are enough degrees of separation there to ensure my safety, but that is, again, a personal preference.

				Set up your bitcoin client on a thumb drive (pref. truecrypt file) that runs via tor.<br />Have an anonymous email like @tormail.net (used for get-bitcoin.com communication)<br />Via TOR go to get-bitcoin.com and provide your anonymous email, btc address.<br />Cash deposit to either chase or BoA.<br />Take a picture of deposit slip, scrub metadata<br />email them the pic<br />receive the btc and then just transfer to SR<br />It&#039;s fast, easy, anonymous, and pretty self reliant<br /><br />You can do it other ways, but why?&nbsp; <br />

				It does seem like a lot and it is normal to feel like you will never understand it.&nbsp; The route I discussed above is the quickest and easiest way I have found that keeps me anonymous enough for my comfort level.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I first started out, I just did Dwolla (Takes forever and connects to my identity) -------&gt;Mt Gox (Can&#039;t use TOR and connects to my real identity)&nbsp; --------&gt; ewallets (Got a bunch of money stolen from mybitcoin) -----&gt;Tumblers (Cost money and don&#039;t trust they do what they are supposed to do)---------&gt;SR<br /><br />Then if you have the product sent to the same address with the evidence of the purchase, i.e., TOR, Browser, bitcoin, etc&nbsp; all on your computer.&nbsp; It is one more nail in the coffin.&nbsp; So that is why I recommend a thumb drive.&nbsp; <br />What I described is probably over kill for a few grams, but after getting money stolen and having time to think about how LE would go about building a case on me........I spent the time to learn a few more steps.<br /><br />Key note about running your bitcoin client from a thumb drive.&nbsp; Even if you export the file to the say Z: drive, it still wants to put your wallet on your C: drive (which is evidence).&nbsp; So don&#039;t forget to make a short cut from the .exe file and in the properties put :&nbsp; Z:\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=Z:\Bitcoin<br /><br />And download the block chain over TOR (Takes a long time so do it before you want to make a purchase).&nbsp; With the new client I had to un check the &quot;Map port using UPnP&quot; while checking the connect through SOCKS4proxy

				/\ Yes, thats just for transfering them across accounts. You cant trade currency for them via the BTC client.<br /><br />I still havent found a btc purchase method that sticks out as &#039;best&#039;,guess I&#039;ll just have to pick a path and stick to it.. If 3 people in a row would suggest a specific route, I&#039;d follow it,but seems that everyone has a different idea of whats best.

				www.bitcoin.org<br />It&#039;s wiki has a lot of great info.&nbsp; Online ewallets and tumblers are great, until you lose coin from them, which I did.&nbsp; I just wanted a solution that I had to rely on as few people/things as possible and if I would be safe if there was an LE like failure at any point.&nbsp; Exchange fails, all they have is a pic of me in the bank.&nbsp; House fails, all they have is a hidden encrypted thumb drive they probably wont get to anyway.&nbsp; SR fails, address always encrypted and my bitcoin address is to an unknown bitcoin wallet running over tor and before that an unknown deposit.&nbsp; There is no direct link to me.&nbsp; With ewallets and tumblers you are trusting they are doing enough to obscure the link back to you.<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet<br />talks about getting your wallet.dat file in the right place.
